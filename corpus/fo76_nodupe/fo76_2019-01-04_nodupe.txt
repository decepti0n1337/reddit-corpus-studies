Yea, I guess its possibly OP did that. I just assumed from the language used ("switched"), that they had indeed switched servers
---
---
---
These *were* available in the beta, and can still be around if people have not moved their camp, but get lost once it is moved.
---
Thanks, very nice 😊
---
Can we get their user names and always be on the look out in game for them and just harass known dupers and youtubers who make videos on how to dupe. When someone finds them they alert other players and we form a mob and destroy their camp and shit. 
---
PA is fucky.   i dont use it as i feel its the cause of the issues people encounter.  
---

---
they can track me, and my gear, but adding me, a frame, my gear and my frames gear together, and tracking all the animations seems to blow up their coding sometimes.  
---
especially when environment interacts, like when there isnt enough room for the animation to play, the game has a jammer.  
---
it sux because its super good early, but i wont risk the game breaking for cool armour suits.  
---
no i wasn't looking at starting anything ether, i was sharing my experiences with nuking whitespring, sorry if i came across angry, i guess its the swearing but I'm Australian i swear ALOT.
---
I help alot of people and alot of rookies, when i get to many stimpacks or radaways, even low level legendary i have spent hours chasing rookies around dropping things at their feet (only cause people dont like trade), i have helped ALOT of newbes only cause i want them to remember that some high level dude was awesome and helped me out, maybe they will do the same when they get higher plus i want to keep the player base high so helping hte newbes is great, but im more talking when you actively see one running around with his one shot. but if i see a rookie ill OFc help him, but again i have been Burned ALOT in this game in regard to this issue.
---
which brings me back yo why i just do the queenie, i can run the solo in 11 mins is my record, and 2.54 mins is the fastest we have killed the queen a white spring run takes over 30 mins to do and you get so many 1 star which you just end up dropping
---
There's a lot of fake news spread regarding mods, but the official stance is just "we don't support them". The people who were banned using mods were found to have been using Cheat Engine as well, so it likely wasn't the mods like 21:9 or glowing plans that were the issue.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I personally have been using text chat, 21:9, and glowing plans, and most of my friends use at least one also. No one I know, or even from the discord, has been banned for using nexusmods afaik.
---
I definitely remember a vendor having it, I want to say either raider vendors at top of the world or Morgan town. But don't quote me on that.
---
Yes but I use long hair that would go through that, I mean your right, but this one helmet I think combat does it too which doesn’t make sense also the actual nuka cola girls hair shows through in the billboard  but you are right and I probably shouldn’t complain
---
I'm doing the same hunt tonight. The discord is so dead. 
---
Because of the Enclave. Supposed to be 500.
---
Yeah, but it's easy to see how people would be confused.
---
This prevents the current generation of lazy gamers achieving instant gratification for doing nothing. The exp system is there so you actually work for your levels and it feels rewarding. They aren’t passing out participation trophies.
---
People like OP are still defending this game? 
---
I'm sorry, I didn't know the gun was loaded!
---
Thank you, Ill definitely do that.
---
Future content?
---
Im trying to build there but can't seem to put the C.A.M.P. in the right spot for both extractors? I thought I had both just for it not let me connect power to th lead extractor
---
In that one it's the mid-west brotherhood they have sentient super mutants and deathclaws also. Their an off shoot of the California Brotherhood after an air ship crashed on it's way to the east coast.
---
I try to help anyone I come across regardless of level. My highest level character is 45 but still at this point in the game I'm picking up more Chems, materials, weapons, and armor than I could possibly need. any time I get a chance I will either drop those items in a cash register or ice box at the train stations or find someone and drop it in front of them if they're close by.
---
If you want regular max levels I have the plans so I can make you the set, dont think I have the chest though just legs and arms
---
This is meta I didn't know.
---
Sent you a friend request. Satsujinma is my psn name.
---
Thank you, Ill keep that in mind.
---
Perhaps not alone but with a couple other level 50+ to offer support, definitely. And I feel that isn’t asking too much considering most servers I join I encounter only 50+ players. I should’ve checked the server first, yes, but a fix should still be implemented to prevent low levels from ruining the experience. Or even a fix to allow solo players a chance to solo her, such as myself
---
I know it's atleast true for workshops. I don't believe you can actually loot camp stuff unless I'm wrong
---
Pc ? 
---
This works, but not consistently. I thought I had it figured out which way to point it, but at a recent camp it put me almost exactly on the opposite side of where I would expect, and even then I wouldn't always spawn in the same spot.
---
Before I log off for the day.  I do some inventory management.  Find the lowest level player on the map and gift all my extras.  I had a player do that to me 20min in.  Good stuff.  
---
In a lobby full of people with no tse guns? Get fucking real dude lol
---
Yep the bridge at Harpers just north of Treetops is the best spot that I found today
---
I think the fact you can earn atoms in games doesn’t warrant the high prices of some things. There are so many other games where you drop $10 and you actually get $10 worth of whatever, not one single flapper dress or photo frame. 
---
So what you saying is..
---
Become wanted.
---
Chill out in somebody else's base.
---
Bait other players to trash it and become wanted themselves. Getting higher bounties for destroying stuff.
---
*Wonderful idea! thank you.*
---
I planned on making a viking character who just roams around singing in my made-up norse/swedish chef type language... I may just record myself doing some of those and put it on loop whenever I'm not talking to someone in the game.  I think it'd be pretty fun, but no good viking haircuts and the fact that people see my username, not Viknord The Viking Bard kinda takes the steam out of the idea... I may yet.
---
Is there a way to get more orbital grenades? I have the ones from the quest I haven’t used yet
---
It's wonderful watching the horror on the face of your DM as his Big Bad Evil Sorceress fails roll after roll, trying to fend off the Bard's love poetry. 
---
Everyone on the team pulls out their weapons and spells. The Bard pulls out a bouquet of flowers and falls to one knee. 
---
Getting the Lead Belly perk (level 2, endurance) goes a long way towards sustainability. With all three ranks, all food and drink become radiation free. This is the very first perk you should get and max out on. It will allow you to enjoy the Cannibal perk (level 15, endurance) - one of the funnest perks in the game. With the Thru-Hiker perk (level 7, agility), you can carry a ton boiled water (and other food/meat/soups) for quick and easy healing. All you need is one Radaway for grabbing a hundreds of bottles of dirty water from the edge of a stream, and wood, which is easy to come by from all the logs and wood piles scattered around the forest region.
---
Stealth would weird this up a bit.
---
Ill just have to find a stable server that wont kick me in 30 mins.
---
It took me 7 tries to get through that quest without disconnecting and I started over each time.  I can't believe I could have just gone to the end.  Holy shit.
---
Hope so. I just want to live in my shack and be a moonshiner. We'll have to see how the "player vendor" gets implemented later down the line.
---
fwiw, the technical data and associated quest forbidden knowledge can reward the BoS paints.
---
Players can track you if you use power armor? I didn't know that. I usually ran in FO4 without power armor unless I was doing a BOS run, but I had read it was imperative and almost a necessity to use it as soon as its obtained in fo76. I'll assume that's only for folk on pvp?
---
&gt;Your actively saying that anyone who doesn't use real money is a man child
---
YOU're assuming that, erroneously. what I'm saying is that there's no market without irl currency. if it's just caps, it's limited by in-game bugs. it's make-believe, roleplaying at best. at which point both our takes are valid: there may or may not be a market. it's all subjective. so don't complain when people abuse limitations, bugs, to get shit they want for free. I don't *have* to partake in your roleplaying.
---
the only way to have an actual market is with actual currency. I'm not saying it's *not* theft, I'm saying that's only as relevant as the company who own the IP wants it to be. Blizz turned a blind eye and thus a market was born. and it predates WoW even, back to D2. EVE openly encourages this behavior. CSGO gambling was a thing until Valve cracke down on it.
---
If you want to be unhappy, work toward your own happiness. If you want to be happy, work toward the happiness of others.
---
You seem to be making the mistake that the way you do things is how everyone does things. That is far from the case. You have an ideal setup there, which is nice, but not always the reality.
---
And I question how much you actually know about modding Bethesda games, because most modders don't know much beyond the main editor, which doesn't give much technical knowledge that in-house QA people at Bethesda wouldn't already have or have access to since they could talk directly with the programmers and level designers to work out the bugs.
---
I'm not sure if you need Makeshift Warrior for mods, but maybe?
---
Also double check that the specific mods are for the chainsaw and not the ripper.
---
Holy, that is some helpful information. Thank you so much. 
---
They should just make the instrument weapons playable - have them take a little damage each time you get well tuned to balance it a little
---
It was doing that to me on PC, but only while I’m in build mode.
---
Ahahahaah
---
Yeah, I think I started trying around level 40. That said, I have "chaperoned" people before that were hanging around. The other night, I helped a level 33 finish off the guys he tagged and get to level 35. He even got a legendary handmade that I dropped for him.
---
Ah good to hear. I wasnt even aware nexus already had a section for fallout 76, I'll check it out.
---
To be honest, it's pretty surprising considering Bethesda wanted people to roleplay all NPCs.
---
Yesssssss
---
Oh sorry, no those are mods for the Wetsuit bought at Phoenix, and through the Census Violence event in the Bog
---
I have had escape artist work but always back into caution never hidden I also find it kind of unreliable but still works sometimes 
---
Yes, exactly, hitting all the gym locations on the same server. 
---
Devastating Sonic Farts 
---
Weight is very important, when you collect junk remember to scrap it at a workbench to lower the weight it takes up in your inventory and in your stash. Later on make the scrap into bulk packages at tinker benches to save even more weight. Also, most types of scrap can only be sold as bulk packages, though there are exceptions.
---
Once you hit level 5 remake all your weapons as level 5 versions for an easy stat boost
---
But it does effect everyone? It's like saying wall hacks don't effect other players in CS:GO your argument is invalid.

---
I think it should be exp sharing within a certain radius. AND the party members would only get half the exp from each others kills, unless they actually tag the mob. Once they tag, full exp again. Gives more incentive to participate more instead of just chilling.
---
[removed]
---
It’s true, I was the lag in the server 
---
Almost forgot, one of the mansions down south. (One of the mine company owners houses) has a gym inside of it with a lot of weights.
---
Save purified water for diluted radaway. If you have the responders quests done then you should have the healing salve recipe. There is a river that runs NE from flatwoods, follow it and pick up bloodleaf as you good and soot flower if you see any (they are the blue ones) then go behind 76 to the north and farm more soot flower. 1 flower+1 bloodleaf+1 boiled water is essentially a diluted stimpack. I can get 50 in about 15 minutes with no perks. They also sell for 3 caps at the vendor so a good source of money as well.
---
Also try heading south, I personally found south to Charleston fire department much easier than Grafton and with MUCH better scavenging.
---
Or use dirty sleeping bags you just murdered a ghoul on.
---
I noticed this as well. First time I took a lowbie to Watoga, the vendor has Handmade gun plans. I bought them, hopped to a new server. Bam, plans again. Bought them too. But afterwards, it took a good hour or so of hopping to find the next copy. And ever since, it takes a while, maybe an hour, maybe two, of hopping.
---
Recently I deleted one of my chars and remade it, and went to Watoga at low level again for the plans. And again, exact same thing happened. I walk in for the first time? Plans. Relog? Plans again. And afterwards about an hour of hopping before plans appeared again.
---
Could be a coincidence, but I very often see comments like "I walked into Watoga on the alt, and plans were there, first try". 
---
Go after both the dealer and the user.
---
User knows it's against the rules, so does the dealer.
---
Yeah. This is the #1 answer people try to give and yet they have no and i've seen no proof it provides any paint other than initiate. 
---
1 lead per 10 rounds wouldn’t be that unbreakable for the game
---
I sincerely hope it puts those vending machines in the Whitesprings basement and makes them indestructible.
---
Otherwise we're going to have 1,000 threads of people screaming that players are griefing their vending machines.  Want to piss someone off?  Smash the vending machine.  Didn't like the prices?  Smash the vending machine.  Then have your buddy claim your bounty.  Rinse and repeat forever.
---
I can be an asshole if needed. 100 caps and some Abraxo and I'll start
---
Thats what gets parroted but after literally HUNDREDS of turn ins only gotten initiate
---
Also I find ground pounder is good with explosives so you can just jump and spray I recommend that you get a TSE automatic handmade can melt everything even without the stealth bonus
---
I've chased an albino deathclaw from whitesprings to the dried up lake... I'm pretty sure it's a glitch where a radstag gets replaced with a deathclaw but still keeps it's radstag moves or whatever
---
Humble brag here. Last night I  gave a couple dozen plans, a shit ton of .308 and .38 ammo, rad chems, and a scopes hunting rifle to a level 2 at the overseers camp. 
---
Dude kept spamming the heart emote and it made me feel good
---
No no I’ve got it handled for free if the need arises 
---
That actually happened to me once almost the exact same deal but I was like level 90 and running at it with a hammer. However, I think my game was bugged because once I hit it it would heal after every hit.
---
But those low levels didn’t ruin the experience. They didn’t do anything but show up? I’m confused. Again wether they were there or not you would of failed, so how did they ruin the experience?
---
Also, you can run the “powering up” the power plant events. Or just go there. If it’s scorched, server hop. Usually mole miners when I do it. Plus you get a chance at the fusion generator if you don’t have it already.
---
Doesnt piss me off it was literally a waste of time ran around in it for 30 mins found about 10 super mutants, it was not fun
---
"Some random dude nobody cares about is cheating so nobody should listen to youtubers bashing my flip asset garbage game because I'm a retarded crybaby."
---
Sounds fair.
---
I won’t, but what I’m saying is that I don’t believe it is amoral to trade virtual currency for real currency because it’s a player run sale instead of a corporate infrastructure based sale 
---
Yep 
---
Oh man, I just commented on another post about this exact same thing. I agree with you, would help lower level friends out a lot when I’m playing with them.
---
Nope, disconnect from server is the only finisher.
---
Why do they hate our blackberries so much.
---
If you keep following the main quest you'll get water purifiers that pump out clean water (no rads).
---
For food, I took the Good Doggy perk and have been 100% self sufficient on dog food forever (3 x the food and 3 x the healing).
---
I like keeping it simple.  Pure water from my camp and dog food I occasionally pick up are all I ever need.
---
I think it's a weird bug based off missing packets from the server. like, the Deathclaw is standing at one point but that information is missing from the server. so the AI tells the Deathclaw to move, but the server replies that it can't do that because it think the mob is standing somewhere else.
---
happened a few times to me. they'll usually mow you down if you get too close, tho.
---
Ok, thanks! Two vendors are a much better deal then all the vendors.
---
Well I agree that they should have either made the cards permanent or gave us a load-out system, but it still sucks the way it actually is.
---
I just made level 100 yesterday and 105 last evening. 
---
I love helping lower-level players, since I never had anyone to help me until I was level 52 and finished with most of the questlines.
---
If you need lead:
---
* Pencils
---
* Cans
---
If you need springs:
---
* Battered clipboards
---
If you need screws:
---
* Globes
---
* Typewriters
---
I don't care what you think about it. 
---
There are websites selling caps for $$. Anyone can sell to through the sites as far as I'm aware.
---
Honestly, I probably would have used them in a different SPECIAL category, I was just throwing out alternatives in case there was a reason for having that many points in INT.
---
Are you sure...it isn't...OVER 9000?
---
I wish Fallout was a play anywhere title. As it is I play in ps4 and xbone.
---
If the vending machines aren’t tied to your stash prepare to see shit priced at 25,000 caps so people can abuse it as free stash weight. 
---
Town square east... Oh wait - going back to my old Gemstone days. XD
---
Ahhhhhh, people are already spending real money on this.  No shit.

I'm working on the investor stuff.  It's hard to pin down actual quotes from them, but there's a reason why we've been seeing less and less quality games and more quick cash grabs.  It's because fewer and fewer investors want to even bother with AAA video games.  The profits just aren't there.
---
No,what i mean is that the weapon mod  appears as placeable but when I try to place it wont apply to the weapon it just makes a sound and from there nothing else happens 
---
Honestly, I've run into several people playing like this, it's still very hard as a low level to tag everything because you can't just hit it once, you have to hit a damage threshold. Just put your tse weapons away for nuke zones. Use it all you want however you want the rest of the time. The rest of us thank you.
---
The thing is it's basically only lip service to the idea anyway. The game is still filled with NPCs, but now they are predictably all robots. or holotapes, or terminal logs. The whole concept of "No NPCs" didn't really work so well and they just fudged it.
---
To answer your questions in order:
---
1. Tank Killer stacks with armor penetrating mods, so it's well worth taking, yes.
---
2. I've seen conflicting reports on this, but I believe it does. It's one of those things that can be hard to check exactly without concrete numbers (unless you're willing to wait for ages as you run in circles). As I barely noticed much of a drop with/without the mutation in the first place though (without the perk), I'm likely not the right person to ask for first hand experience here.
---
3. Escape Artist is one of, if not *the* most important perk in a stealth build. Being harder to detect and damage modifiers are nice, sure, but you need to be stealthed in the first place for these to work. While stealth detection varies between enemies, sometimes you'll still be easily noticed (others invisible as an army of mutants rush straight into you...) so for those incidents, this perk makes or breaks a stealth build. Hop around a corner and crouch and you will generally have anything chasing you lose sight of you if you stick to the shadows. Hell, if you attack fast, you can even crouch in front of an enemy right up in your face and get a sneak attack or two off before they notice you again. Escape Artist is more useful than most other perks, and it only costs one point - hands down one of the best perks if you play a stealth build!
---
4. Before we got respeccing I juggled back and forth between Sneak 1 and Sneak 3 for extra damage output from various other perks. I'd dare say there was a noticeable difference. If you keep your distance, Sneak 1 might be enough for most situations, but if you typically rush through a building to clear it as I usually do (using Adrenaline for insane damage) I'd definetely go for rank 3 unless you really can't justify that point being lost elsewhere. Optimizing sneak for a sneak build can only be considered ideal.
---
5. All Night Long basically basically just slows the rate at which you get hungry/thirsty, as you yourself guessed.
---
Hope you find some of this useful :)
---
Tse?
---
Hmmm...I could really go for an unending tesla rifle to avoid reloading.
---
Oh I'm fully aware how we do things is not how everyone else does them. It's just how sane people and sane companies do things.
---
Our processes are based off the experience of others that have been in the industry a long time and books like code craft. 
---
If you don't have processes like those and you scale up to 300 developers, you're not going to get good results. So as a company if you want to have a large development team spread across the world on a single project you need to make sure that you have a good process.
---
And maybe a weight perk card for rifles, like every other weapon.
---
Right?
---
I’d be down if you’ll have a lvl 34
---
Need to change how the entire game's scaling is done. As a lvl 21, running into a bunch of lvl 60+ mirelurks is NOT fun. They are heavily armoured, stagger frequently, and you don't have armor penetration to deal with them yet. All because a lvl 100 passed by the area a while ago. This is asinine.
---
Good example of how to do this better is Elder Scrolls Online - the entire world is scaled to player. You're lvl 21? The whole world is lvl 21. You kill them, you get normal XP, and loot you can fucking use! And if you group with a lvl 50 friend, he sees the same enemies as lvl 50, and gets lvl 50 XP, and lvl 50 loot he can fucking use! The game just scales everyone's HP and DPS behind the scenes. Works amazingly well.
---
I would literally run right up to it and it would sprint away. I beat it to death with a sledgehammer eventually. I can link a video when I get home if you want to see exactly what it was doing.
---
Dont stress, gives me something to do in game. Cheers though
---
How are you so sure I would’ve failed? There were some other decent levels there and my impression was that we would’ve won if the 8 useless players weren’t there giving her massive damage resistance. Either way, this should be addressed because say I came in with a loaded, min/maxed specced out team and we still failed due to the useless newbies 
---
And get gun-fu - it works with melee too
---
I keep moving and have hit up a number of interesting spots. Currently working on a tree house in the swamp. Built a tower going up into a train in cranberry bog. Built a big base around/within carhenge north of the ammo factory. Its a challenge but you learn how all the camp stuff really works and what you can/cant get away with. Oh yeah, and on the highest point in the world too!
---
I wonder if that distant scorch beast had something to do with it. Robots dying in one place, triggering extra spawns elsewhere.
---
I just got a decent auto tesla rifle and am considering doing this. Do you double back to inspect the meat piles for loot? I've had it happen too often that the bodies/meat piles disappear after not that much time.
---
One day with find some aspect of this game that isn't riddled with bugs and/or poorly tested/reviewed content.
---
One day.
---
Never.. I mean... please change, fallout 76. Please change.
---
Not really. I'm not shooting something for the sole sake of "getting credit," I'm shooting it to take it down. Pretty stark difference.
---
The one you're thinking of is "Fallout: Tactics" which also focuses on the brotherhood. "Fallout: The Brotherhood of Steel" takes place is texas and sucks asshole. I watched gameplay on it and it just looked terrible. It was made by the original creators of fallout as a cash grab before it was sold to bethesda and was their first attempt at a console game. 
---
That perk basically saves you from ever needing to repair weapons, assuming you cycle through them all often enough.
---
The REAL question is what if they hide in another player's house and you orbital strike it, but then a third guy rushes the loot, takes fire damage and panics, and VATS shoots another guy who was the actual owner of that house?
---
Awww. That sucks. I've certainly come across some antagonists while playing, too.
---
 I guess it takes a sea of darkness for the stars to actually shine.
---
Forest Treasure Map #08 is where I got mine
---
I have an exploding shotgun, the weird thing is I purchased it from Whitesprings vendor after a nuke. You see, it's a three star legendary and the first star is +10% to players. They must have saw that and just sold it.
---
Always. Check. People.
---
On a side note, I have killed myself SO many times with this monster. I basically play now like a weapons platform, operating artillery. 
---
I'm sure there's an "Execute" option if you down another player in PvP, but I haven't actually tried it out.
---
&gt; but if you're going to make a public video (1) selling bottlecaps for real $$$, 
---
If if if. No I don't see him selling bottlecaps for money. Sorry but if. He has referral link/code to site that sells them.
---
And overall, I see nothing in the video that would prevent me from enjoying the game. He said he's duped those candies. Well it seems fair enough. He is making, what to call them, digested videos about the game. It's a lot easier to dupe a bunch of candies to show off what kind of random loot you can get from the event. He is not going around duping a lot of stuff and selling it for lolcaps.
---
I am real DUDE. What did people do before everyone had a TSE??? Jesus christ you're a pussy for needing that crutch
---
Never been to white springs but thank you!
---
And be careful - they can open doors too
---
There exists an orbital strike in the game? oO
---
I'm honestly surprised.  My response to the other guy has a couple of links I found with a quick search.  There's a lot more out there.  
---
It originally started with people paying 5 bucks for something like 10,000 caps, but those people were selling duped items for 1000's of caps.  Now they just sell the items directly.
---
Yeah, been there. I did this to someone and knocked off 40% of their health by accident. Then one-shotted me with a two-shot explosive weapon and I ragged dolled like a toddler in my yellow excavator armor.
---
I am a good folk on PC!
---
Find a nearby container or corpse to put stuff in instead of throwing it on the ground. I can’t seem to manage to figure out how to trade with lower level players so instead I just emote to get attention and put stuff in a box or ice chest or corpse of a recently slain critter and then jump on top of it repeatedly, hoping they get the hint
---
Ah ok :)  I actually use a fair number of points in INT simply because other than STR no other category appeals as much to me with it's QoL perks.  Makeshift Warrior, power user, batteries included, plumber, gunsmith all do a huge amount to reduce your downtime.  At level 228 I don't need more damage, I need speed.
---
Like tea-bagging, eh?
---
Ya know, this is changing my perspective a bit.  Thank you!  
---
Lol just imagine the future... Certified non-duped caps, farmed by frat bots who need beer money in iowa... Makes me chuckle.
---
Had this happen to me, it crouched behind a truck when I lost sight of it, then jumped out to wreck me. I took the bait hard 
---
This reminds me of the notes you find in F04 at the military fort you have to clear of Super Mutants once you join the Brotherhood. There's various details on the development and testing of the Fat Man mini-nuke, along with a non-surprising field fatality of one of the testers. I'm sure he thought he was also standing far enough back. :)
---
Not as annoying as people hiding in the shed during scorchqueen!
---
I just leave the doors open
---
Man I want to make a "**band**"...
---
I've got a vampiric Guitar sword, we'd only need a death tambourineand maybe a backup guitar to make it work!

Both the revenant and MS wikia pages say yes to my question: 
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Revenant
---
Not sure about yours :/
---
Really? You think, and you feel its correct, that Bethesda has any rights outside of their game? That's so stupid to think so.
---
no, the same thing happened to me. I think the Deathclaw is actually trying to get to the right coords so it can attack you. it's not fleeing from your mighty sledgehammer.
---
a Behemoth glitched the same way for me. I could get it to attack if I placed it just right.
---
Lmfao I remember that
---
My charisma is 5 and I only have a level 3 animal friend card (I never get wasteland whisperer), and so far the animals I’ve managed to tame before are Deathclaw, Mirelurk King, the big mutated frog and the big lobster (forgot their names) with the level 3 animal friend card equipped. 
---
So I kinda think that charisma does not affect your ability to tame a pet. You just gotta equip a level 3 animal friend card (or level 3 wasteland whisperer for maybe snallygaster? This one I cannot confirm though), and find a solo spawn on those set “random spawn” points. There’re quite a few posts on reddit sharing these locations, for example, right below East Ridge Lookout (south-east of Vault 94) is a random spawn location. Hope this helps, all the best getting your new pet! =)

**T**wo **S**hot **E**xplosive.
---
another confusing one is "SS" which is **S**wing **S**peed
---
I was there last night for my first time as a level 30. Figured why not I finally had decent power armor. 
---
I kinda picked up on what people were doing really quick with the ledge. It was dope. Went up like 3 levels in 10 mins. 
---
You can go to Poseidon power plant, and there's one on the roof in a smashed up office. Level 5 is the lowest you can find them in. 
---
&gt; You mostly do it for the achievement and for the extra legendary mobs that get summoned when you fight her.
---
Maybe you do, but I assure you farming the queen for her drops is "mostly" why people nuke prime.
---
“This is what I seen” is the hillbillyest shit I’ve heard in a while. Thank you. 
---
Well my thought is that the team would be working together as a group and that everybody on a team should get some partial benefit for collaborating together in the same area - even if they themselves didn't get the kill shot on a specific enemy.
---
Today it almost feels like you are "stealing" exp from other team members if you are the only one to get a shot/kill an enemy. This is a frequent issue I run into when I'm playing co-op.
---
I agree it shouldn't be a full amount of exp - as that could be a bit unbalanced - but some partial amount of EXP while in the same area.
---
Complain about problems while simultaneously becoming the problem.
---
Uh Mr. scorchbeast near by will say hello from time to time.   
---
You really need a max of like three bobby pins at any given time. I’m not arguing over the morality of cheat mods, but he’s right in saying that a mod reducing bobby pin weight is meaningless when I stopped picking them up because of their uselessness. That’d be like a mod reducing holotape weight to 0, were it not by default. 
---
I get the feeling that the more I try to express my opinion on this situation here, the more I’m just going to garner mass disapproval. Obviously some people feel differently, but from what I heard people were being kicked off for QoL improvements like inventory sorting that were present and ubiquitous in the other games, and after paying $60 for s game with a fluctuating market price that has been riddled with trouble since launch day, I don’t believe that’s entirely fair. Call me crazy, but it sounds like the decisionmaking progress revolves around booting people who want to play the game in a more traditional way as opposed to the new paradigm reliant on grinding and larger team tactics. 
---
Am I a dick for thinking this? Because I feel like I’m being judged heavily based on a fairly common opinion related to a game I obviously had a lot of hope for. 
---
How are you able to locate someone’s base
---
So I've made some legit contributions, but they appear to have been moderated for some reason. Is it because I was the only person who seems to have offered up the items location or..... Brotherhood officer suit BTW.
---
Thirdstorm...
---
I'll warn you, I can also be a bit boring, as I horde stuff to trade/sell/donate... and we all know Inventory management can be a massive time sync!
---
I had the same type of thing happen and like the other poster mentioned it was because my Makeshift warrior wasn't high enough.  I didn't get any sort of error message indicating that was the problem though.  It sounded and looked like the mod was successful but it didn't go on.
---
Sure, but at this point you cant forget a large portion of the fault lies with Beth. This has been allowed to stay for far too long. It seems they have no way to remove the duplicate items (that's just stupid). The sad part is at this point the game is super effed up in the economy. If someone did attempt to sell stuff they got, if they did not DUP it the market value will be terrible. I have stopped playing for reasons like this, I like the game but frankly its piss poor management by beth.  Meanwhile things that cost money go up on that overpriced store and players continue to get shafted. Duping is terrible and lame. Not fixing it and having safeguards in place with online game is worse.  *sigh*
---
Not to mention you fuck over anyone trying to do the brotherhood questline if they dont have decent rad resist
---
And now there's all kinds of people actually complaining about putting your camp in Whitesprings because turrets will "steal their kills" when they are trying to farm legendary drops, and they'll trash your camp and don't care about the bounty.
---
People aren't going to change, so they just need to fix the core problem and balance out the spawn point locations. 
---
Agreed, but probably not that. I want to see a purpose for pistols, but I hate the idea of making them only work alongside VATS. There's many situations where VATS is just a gigantic pain in the ass to use.
---
I think a simpler solution would be a pistol-specific reload perk (maybe instant reload, but much higher chance than 18% you get from Luck), some kind of armor penetration or special ammo types (fire, frost, poison, etc.), and make Gun Runner stack with Speed Demon/Maneuvers, so that a pistoleer is 20% faster than anyone else.
---
lol one of my mules has 32,500 pounds, with weight reduction perks... all horded since the Beta...
---
Its an annoying bug but its not a huge deal You just need to make another shot. Generally happens when I use my explosive shotgun on things that are flying or somewhat far away enemies
---
Juicehead makes clickbait titles, stirs up controversy over nothing, and makes sloppy videos. He is very much guilty of taking something tiny and stretching it across a 10 minute video. And by the end of it all, all he does is contribute nothing. Someone somewhere says "What if they make it free to play?" the he makes a video with the title "Fallout 76 to be free to play" and somehow that ends up being brought back here in an angry post of people that can't think for themselves. 
---
any kind of explosive weapon can kill a power armor , as long as you have the right perks. What works better is having 1-2 buddy help you in party. Usually man power wins the fight
---
Fo76 acting like a real pos today. Constant disconnect, mucho lag so trying to heal in a of fight was almost laughable. Do you think Bethesda is really trying to fix or do they even know how. Seems after each fix things get worse. Your thoughts and comments please.
---
It could be but the scorch beast left the area after a minute or two.
---
I’m definitely not saying it was afraid of the almighty sledge. haha
---
I’m just grateful to have gotten some decent loot at a fairly low level.
---
So the fix for this is to upgrade my makeshift warrior? I currently don’t have it 
---
On paper it sounds great, but with 600lbs of junk, it's a 1 click rebuild, and another 15mins to re farm it.
---
Do it though, still. 
---
my keybind was set to forward slash "/?" key
---
1 day only atom shop additions are very annoying. What is more annoying is how no article covers these additions in any way.
---
Both my friend and I found that our Gauss rifles now miss almost 100% of the time on the first VATS shot as well including crit shots.  It is totally hosed.
---
even IF you were able to trade codes you can just go to [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) for this weeks solved codes.
---
Actually there seems to be a mechanic for that, I do take periodic damage when I'm that heavy..
---
That said, Bobby Pins should not weight 1/10th of a pound..
---
A Handmade is 7.6'ish pounds unloaded (Unlike the 22 pounds in '76) and a Laser gun should weight about 3 or 4 pounds max, based on the fact per the lore it's mostly plastic.. Sooooo
---
Remember, you can't build near each other. 
---
You can build fairly close though
---
PC All day...
---
It me. I'd love if there were some mutations or combination of mutations that would change our character model into a Super Mutant or Ghoul.  
---
pACifISt MOde
---
I've had my base here for 2 weeks and the scorchbeast has only ever flown over to my base twice. You also have some help from your friendly assaultrons and bots in case of any pesky flying rats ;)
---
power armour frames give good rad resistance.  nuked areas are endgame, likely needed there.  im only level 40 so i got some learning to do.  
---
and i just meant the server tracks you and seems to have trouble managing all of a characters assets.  hence the crashes/glitches.   not sure though, not a programmer.  
---
Ok, on now will dm you
---
i thought you can if you're in a group together?
---
well if we can have good communication that wouldn't be an issue! =)
---
Yess. I would love to be jamming out as I walk down the highway, swinging my instrument at enemies with a loud twang.
---
Actually I wear Raider Power Armor (and Raider Armor) and Will RP the Raider life a bit later on, "Maybe"...
---
I mean how is it fun to murder and loot the 'Vaulties if all they have is a couple caps and a stimpac, got to fatten those marks up ;)
---
You really can't build fairly close. Have you tried building around someone before? 
---
You may get a "cluster", but they'll be fairly spread out. 
---
No, I don’t think so. The recipe is never learned by you, it just shows up in your recipe list if you open the crafting interface with the mod still in your inventory. If you disconnected after using the mod, you’d have to open the crafting window again with the mod not in your inventory, which would just open it normally without the mod listed in your recipes.
---
First taste is free!
---
Funniest part was this happened during the one day I turned off pacifist mode. 
---
I don’t think you can remove mods like in Fallout 4, or at least if you do, it destroys it
---
You can, it’s called fallout 4
---
I have in fact and although they cannot be that close a small community with the center being the lake would be quite nice
---
Well I think a server browser and favourited servers would be amazing, but I think the issues are actually local as well as Bethesdas fault. But I feel that most of these issues are from certain areas, either that or people's general internet. 
---
Add me Cooljuanito99 
---
I made a public camp area with 3 tents, beds, stash boxes, free water and all the crafting benches but I had to close it down when in two or three instances players showed up and just griefed everything :/
---
"Accidentally"
---
Myths and legends only. Those don't really exist. 
---
is this the ultra lonely area with 2 big lakes 1 below 1 above? because if so make sure you build on the upper one since I've seen scorchedbeasts move from the nearby station to attack people's bases on the lower lake before
---
 any kind of explosive weapon can kill a power armor , as long as you have the right perks. What works better is having 1-2 buddy help you in party. Usually man power wins the fight 
---
I learned the hard way at level 29 when I threw a grenade into a swarm of nuked ghouls at Whitesprings...
---
It is a small lake with a large tree next to it
---
I had a 400 cap bounty just yesterday and didn’t even know it was possible. Some guy kept coming to my base and breaking stuff so then I just killed him and fixed it. About 10 minutes later he does he same thing. So I kill him yet again. I go on my way and it says my base is under attack, sure enough, it’s him but this time he fast travels back to his base as soon as I get back to mine. So naturally I followed him and watched him as he just sat in his beautiful base with an extractor and purifiers. Given, this guy was only a level 28, who knows how he had that much, but probably a second character. So I took out his entire base and had a 400 bounty. So I told my friend to kill me so he would get the bounty and not the other guy. But the other guy just left the server after I crushed his entire base anyway. I still don’t know why he kept trashing one or two walls of my base and then doing nothing else. Pretty odd if you ask me. 
---
A lot of the camp stuff comes with finding/buying plans, but agree with basically all of this. as a mostly rifle build I have like 15 receivers to choose from. maybe 4 are useful, and Hardened somehow always wins because nothing does better damage. At least make a few of them comperable so it feels like you are sacrificing one feature to get another a bit more.
---
Level doesn't matter
---

Please note another duper volunteering for banning.
---
"can't handle servers" lol
---
There is so much potential in this game for funny and useful emotes. Like a Vape Nation one. Heck, we already have a slav squat one.
---
I try to help ppl if I can as I have made weapons and given away plans, recipes and power armour frames to lower lvl even made excavator armour lvl 45 for a guy I just made friends with.
---
    But as others as well I  have  had my run in with the bad players of the game as well as the good who have helped me along the way. 
---
I imagine that players will migrate to an area to form a "player hub" of sorts, or at least plop their camps in highly populated areas. With that being said I do hope we can make our camps visible on the map, that'd be tight. 
---
yeah
---
In Queen zones it can be dicey, I keep having my stuff stolen if/when I die by some jackoff rocking a Hazmat suit under 50, **so around the Prime Site even I'm wary of the Lowbies..**.
---
They took away in game followers, so we make them ourselves ;)
---
This strategy is approved by the Appalachian Security Services - Heavy Arms Tactical Squad. 
---
But why would I ever spend money when I can buy anything I want from atom earned in game? :P
---
Hope everything is ok!
---
Ahh, that makes sense. Skeet Shooter 3 makes a huge difference vs none. It's a boon rather than a sacrifice for shotgun builds. I think VATS with any shotgun, not just two-shot, is mainly useful for crit builds. 1st shot to fill up the crit bar with Four Leaf Clover 3, then target the head with Concentrated Fire 1 and get massive damage with unlimited crit headshots that are also more effective at range than ADS since crits always hit.
---
on PC?
---
Got to help the fellow raiders out!
---
Lol, fuck this store it's 5 caps above what I paid elsewhere. *KABOOOOOOOOOM* 
---
Yeah I could see that as a problem. Raiders would like that,  though. 
---
Sounds good
---
Feel like droping a nuke? Add me razvan4life
---
Being in a group doesn't change anything. You still have to build outside of the, rather large, radius of the first camp. 
---
ah ok haven't been there before will go check it out since my base is in that part of the world anyway sadly I'm on ps4 so won't be able to join in this endeavour
---
Or when you are disconnected. I cleared the entirety of Fort Defiance last night and was right by the quest goal at the top, and then got dropped by the server. Sure enough, respawned all the way outside and all enemies in and out have refreshed. 
---
I guess you cared enough to read my post and comment on it though, thanks buddy! :D
---
If she had a proper loot table (instead of giving nothing half the time), and if the game worked without disconnects then yeah. As it is, I nuke fissure site prime for the quest rewards and the mobs that come with her. Not the actual scorchbeast queen, who usually only has one star legendary or nothing on her dead body. The little loading screens for the dead bodies including hers are so bugged. Meanwhile I can go to a nuked Whitesprings and get 3 star items from ghouls and whatever spawns there
---
nice!
---
They are SUPPOSED to be. 
---
Meh, figured as much. Thanks ks for the heads up!
---
&gt;razvan4life
---
im only level 16 or so is that ok?
---
problem is they spawn tier to who zoned into the Cell first...
---
I so regret scrapping all those 10 - 30 Hazmat suits.
---
I also think that people need to remember its a online game and that of course like every other online game and there will be issues, especially in a game so safistacated like fallout. It's amazing it works as well as it does to be honest 
---
You should not complain at all. I started during the BETA when nobody had any "legendary" gear or even power armor for that matter.I played SOLO and i had no problems. Now i have got everything i wanted in the game and i'm not afraid of teams anymore. Recently had a workshop pvp where i was attacked but easily killing the 2 of them with my explosive shotgun.
---
The NDA requires you to fill out an organizational permit. You may not hold this contest unless you are approved. The NDA will exterminate any and all violators. If you break the organizational clause of the NDA, the NDA will hunt you down like the lawbreaker you are. Your 1,000 caps will be returned to their rightful owner.
---
I hope they put in an emote where I bang your ass after I claim that bounty you recieved for griefing. 
---
Agreed. I think the hair in Fallout is generally bad, thank god there are some pretty good hair mods for the other games.
---
Better wait a lit more .... 
---
all about how you play (IMHO)..
---
I never break out the sledge unless it's a boss / dire emergency, otherwise it's Guitar sword / dagger all the time, much more fun for me..
---
I mean I could one shot everything in WhiteSprings since level 40, now it's about killing with Style!
---
ah ok saw some videos of people building houses together guess they were building off of one camp 
---
I mean... after that many levels, you've gotta have all the cards, right? So does the game keep asking if you want to pick a perk card, still?
---
hahaha yeahhhhhhhh
---
Thanks for the tip! Will try to remember.
---
Most of these have been resolved and the games doing ok 
---
hahaha yeah i tried the other day..i made the mistake of grabbing whichever plans were avail in the cases..which was a HUGE no-no..so i server-hopped which felt like forever..but i got great experience with the mutants because im not high level yet..and that is also a great place to grind because from that building after climbing through the train i dont think anyone (AI) can actually figure out how to get there unless they are really close to u..i ended up buying the wetsuit off of someone here..that grind session was not my favorite
---
&gt;You exclusively post in English, so I doubt that.
---
Oh wow. That kinda makes me to have English as first language too. 
---
You sure Reddit is the whole universe and no forums outside of it exists?
---
I have a spare Warehouse building plan. I'm on ps4 as well. 
---
PSN: Temias_trvlr
---
tbh even if Bethesda somehow removed every single duped item from the game, there are still people who duped consumables like serum recipes or other rare stuff like jetpack plans. All those plans/recipes/etc which are unlocked on your character wouldn't be affected if they just removed stuff like weapons or armor.
---
Right, if you're in a group you can build in the other person's camp. 
---
*However*, you're not building *your* camp. You're just building additions to *their* camp. 
---
Or maybe perk so you can crit outside of vats on pistols. Although pistol build is already way way full on perks. They would need to merge this stuff into pistol perks already.
---
I could imagine it being tied to your CAMP stash in some capacity. They're pretty cautious of thier servers atm. 
---
Top of the world vendor thats surrounded by mobs. 99% sure. Btw its Plan: Cooler. Plan: ice machine is something else
---
Ah alright. I asked around and half the people suggested it ran more stable on the xbox/pc so I was at odds. I play FO4 more on the pc than on the xbox, but that's mostly due to all the mods on the nexus, and I still use a controller for it.
---
I'm sorry the game *is* an accident.
---
Perks pretty much every late game damage focused build will use:
---
3* Glow Sights
---
3* Bloody Mess
---
1* Adrenaline
---
Perks required if using mutations:
---
2* Starched Genes
---
3* Class Freak
---
(Optional: 1* Strange in Numbers)
---
Perks required for automatic Heavy Gun focused build:
---
At least 1* of each Heavy Gunner damage perk
---
3* Bear Arms
---
3* Stabilized
---
3* One Gun Army
---
(Optional: 5* Gunsmith
---
3* Luck of the Draw)
---
All power armor/fusion core perks are also relevant, as Stabilized requires power armor. 
---
Oh damn, what platform are you on?
---
im lazy right now, but on nexus you can download a beta version of the FO76 edit program and find the paint mod recipe, then follow that to the leveled reward list to see what rewards it. Following that reference chain you can see it has a chance to be rewarded by the forbidden knowledge quest. from there its a random chance for a schematic/clothing item off the BOS clothes list, which is probably why the circulation of those plans is pretty low.
---
The yellow circle just means where it will drop. The cargobot won't have arrived yet. Wait a few mins and it'll turn into a diamond and the cargobot will have dropped it
---
I don't think it sucks. It's well balanced as long as you don't go out of your way to build a min-maxed character.
---
Yeah we that top floor in the corner is a great sniper spot
---
Anyone got a jet pack for sale or calibrated shocks or Tesla coils?
---
Public Service Announcement
---
Alright, thanks!
---
yeah I was in constant despair re: repairing armor that required ballistic fibre. White Knight + Fix It Good and I'm finally accumulating ballistic fibre instead of constantly looking for it. One of the best perk investments I've made since hitting Lvl 50 and having access to every card.
---
fasnacht mask? its in fort defiance
---
Makes sense though, provided your sneak skill is good enough and you're not sitting in the sun or under in a lit up place, it makes enemies lose track of you, so they start searching. Thus caution. Hidden would imply that they instantly forget about you. It can quickly change to hidden if you crouch and quickly sneak away from them however.
---
Wholesome Fallout experience, man. 
---
We need more like this, and more positivity. 
---
As long as it plays the lyric *I DIDN'T KNOW THE GUN WAS LOADED!* in a bubble over their head.
---
I completely disagree. Vats is actually overpowered late game with some builds and weapons and real time vats has some fun game play advantages over previous vats. For example, being able to do vats while falling.  Jumping off a building and vats headshotting a ghoul on the way down is fun. I'd acually like for it to be an option in future fallouts.
---
Meh..I'll usually gun them down, guard their stuff and offer to buy a bullet for the price of their bounty...if they're low level with a low bounty that is.
---
I’ve honestly never played a game with such a positive community. I think it’s the flak that the game has received that has banded everyone together and I love it!
---
TSE?
---
No, it’s the mask you can wear for a limited time while doing the monster mash at the watoga highschool. I saw another player wearing it and a video on YouTube. But I can’t seem to figure out how to get it. d:
---
This. Your goal is to lob the MIRV’d mini nuke package over the target so when the package pops, it rains straight down directly on the target. Find a wide open area and fire a shot way up high, like 30-45 degrees, and watch the projectile(s). The effective range of the thing is only from “as close as you can be without killing yourself” to the distance you can get the projectile before it splits. Once it splits, it goes straight down it seems. 
---
Not great with terminology, but razorgrain hops could be a homemade brew. Or even mutfruit wine?
---
Apparently radiation damage is effective against scorched. 
---
EIGHT BUCKS FOR A HAIRSTYLE BAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH
---
I agree, however, it shouldnt be so easy to kill the hardest enemies in the game.
---
Trading ammo.  
---
Make sure when you want to trade ammo not to drop it on the ground as it dissapears immediately.
---
Issue happens on asphalt, or when you are standing on a corpse, or if you drop huge quantitie. 
---
You can put it in to any kind of storage or just straight up trade it.
---
dont u need some sort of base on top of one
---
Prime handmade, 50 cal, or gatling gun
---
It would be wrong if it wasn't right. I tend to play as more of a generalist but fully realizing that not specializing puts me at a huge disadvantage because that's actually what a ton of the game is about with skills and perks. And now there's a bunch of extra food and stuff to carry, and limited carry/storage, which means everyone is having to pair-down their builds and specialize even more. 
---
That's basically the whole model of the game, you can't argue people shouldn't be doing it.
---
Dude nice. A helping hand in the beginning can make all the difference.
---
The plan for them is called "Powered Doors" btw.
---
I'm not assuming, in the small time we've exchanged points a small consensus has happened with my original comment of don't buy with real money and you and the other guys comment who mentioned buy with real currency. Small sample size but it certainly helps my point over yours. I have a shred of evidence that just a small sample size disagree with paying more money to win at a game that they have already payed for. Pay to win is never a good idea. If we create your market and create this real world currency market your so eagerly defending, a lot of players will quit. Sure it works for Diablo and WoW and a handful of others but this is Fallout 76 and it's not the game that needs pay to win. So yes real currency is an option but if it was implemented your buyers would drop because the player base would drop. It's just not that serious of a game to include pay to win mechanics. 
---
*Hey I just bought a 2SE gun for $20*
---
*im going to be so strong, oh I'm only doing slap damage and no one is engaging me back because they know they will be one shot*
---
Wasted Money
---
*Hey I just bought a gun that can bypass the slap damage for $40*
---
*haha I killed you but now I'm wanted, ah well people will see how strong I am for the money I spent*
---
Nope they will just see you as a dick
---
Jet Pack.  But my door is always open lvl103, and bought most plans so it looks ok.
---
No there's a way to get the prebuilt stairs to just stack on top of each other so you can make a stairwell but I can't find the video that showed me how 
---
I have yet to do this with mine, bought the parts but haven’t assembled, but with a little cutting you can fit a raspberry pi with a 4.3 capacitive screen in it.  Use a Bluetooth speaker for the actual speaker and sync with the pi, and even put a mini keyboard on top of the holotape player.  If I ever find time to do it I’ll be sure to post pics, but feel free to do it before me :)
---
Two Shot Explosive ranged weapons, my handmade does 600 damage a shot
---
Ah my mistake.
---
Good guys my ass.
---
I treat whitespring like a game of pickup. Ask if I can get in, try to huddle in the kill loop. Eventually, it gets cutthroat, and players just are out for blood, which is fine.
---
Then, my wife goes to whitespring. That cutthroat attitude? Yeah, you would have thought she was the last woman alive in west Virginia. Players kicking ppl from their party to give her a spot, stupid amounts of 3 star legendaries bestowed at her feet. It's bullshit.
---
And no, she doesn't share the loot. She's really competitive.
---
You can build them at tinker workbenches I believe. If it’s not the tinker then it’s the chem station.
---
Easy killer you are probably not as good as you think you are.
---
PC
---
A wider radius in this instance. 
---
I get 30-45 fps during this.  Then it takes forever to load the Queen's inventory
---
This made me laugh
---
Absolutely!
---
The lock pick bar, is in no way, a QoL improvement, it's strait up a 'here, put the pick here and it'll unlock' it takes away what skill is needed to pick a lock and, more or less, auto picks it for you, much like how there is a similar thing with terminal passwords, both of them take out an obstacle to you getting through a door or into a loot container, or a number of other things, and 'cheating' your way to bypass it isn't exactly fun for the person in question, nor is it fair for those that aren't also cheating.
---
TL:DR; the 'lockpick bar' and similar mods that make it so that you just 'get everything' without trying shouldn't be considere QoL mods or improvements, cause they aren't.  They are cheats, and trying to say they aren't is like saying that Putin was fairly elected as the russian leader despite most that oppose him having accidents or the like and as such people don't run against him.
---
I should have had have sawed that coming
---
1. PC
---
2. \[redacted\]
---
3. Infinite loading screens on fast travel
---
4. Twice now I've tried to fast travel to Charleston Landfill only to get stuck on an infinite loading screen. On both occasions I had claimed the workshop and built up some structures there.
---
This is getting really frustrating, between frequent disconnects and now this problem, it's really hard to justify ever taking over a workshop for resources.

1. Ps4

2. Raider0025

3. None

4. Master holotape durinf Coming to Fruition main quest doesnt work.  Pick the correct holotape for the terminal and  nothing happen.
---
All good, I didn't even know Fallout: Brotherhood of steel was even a thing until about 3 weeks ago. Thank God I wasn't into fallout when it came out or i wouldn't be here,  lol. 
---
Thanks. All is well; I assume it’s just a bad sinus cold but just preventative measures.
---
They can spread pistols wider too. I mean, shotguns are spread over Str, Per and Agi. Heavies are spread over Str, Int and Lck. Rifles are Perc, Agi and Lck. Pistols are just Perc and Agi, so that's part of the problem. 
---
Cant wait to see someone selling 100 tse combat shotguns
---
It'd be cool of we could have the option to become neighbors and connect our boundaries. That way neighborhoods would be achievable. Or just an area of empty homes in a culdesac for us to decorate or add onto.
---
I'll probably keep playing until they add guilds/clans and stuff all the new progression into multiplayer only events (raids).
---
Every great single player/small group game I've played in the past decade, that has added "large group" content as the exclusive progression method for late game players just becomes a huge unfun timesink for me and I end up quitting. I want games that start out as "jump in when you have time, play for as long as you have time" to stay that way, instead of becoming "be online for these 3 hours every night or get nowhere".
---
ahhhh ok..my bad
---
Yea it would
---
This. I just got my Double 50% limb damage gatling gun a prime receiver plan (though I'm still trying to decide whether it's better than the speedy receiver plus rank 3 Martial Artist), just need to find those sweet, sweet .50 cal prime receiver plans now. 
---
Bloodied explosive .50 cal is already a pretty good queen killer with big guns/explosive bobbles, low health, adrenal reaction, and psychobuff...can't wait to add ultracite ammo to the mix.
---
I am on PC. I have not experienced a lot of bugs commonly I see people talk about, but this one is pretty consistent for me. It feels at best 50/50 odds of not CTD, and if you factor disconnections due to dupers it really sucks lol.
---
Say are you interested in stopping by there’s a lot of space here and we could use more people 
---
Ahhh I’m on Xbox but you’re a hero!
---
You don't need to be good with all the busted ass TSE weapons in the game. Regardless I was just trolling like you were. 
---
My friend and I came across this last night. We cleared them all out, but it didn't help the lag on the server unfortunately.
---
Great to hear!
---
Always had a soft spot for the SMITE voice packs. I mean actually getting more VAs in studio to record new shit to match a skin takes some actual creativity and effort.
---
This actually happens to me with LOTS of legendary monsters.
---
In fact, I would say 80% of legendary monsters I meet outside of events and ghouls run away from me at all costs. I have chased super mutants, scorched, molemen, deathclaw, yao guai, and likely many others that have done nothing but run away.
---
Not 100% sure in your case, but it was my problem.  The mod itself should say I think.  Worth checking.
---
Got saved by a level 39 in nuke t51 last night at top of the world when I got involved with a bunch of lvl 59 primuses(?) at top of the world.
---
I didnt even know there was other paints. Ive only ever seen paladin on reddit and initiate in-game. People are saying its all based on how high your luck attribute is
---
There are not unlimited employees or resources to hire more employees. 30 day return windows are how long you have to return a product, but it does not mean your money will be returned to you within that time period. Its a sucky fact about life, but sometimes things take time and I doubt its any individual employees fault so I would not say they suck at their job. 
---
Tomorrow.
---
Only reason I’d consider locking it is hoping someone tries to pick it and I can kill them 😂
---
Yeah it’s a sucky system 
---
So, that i understand this coreectly. That information is based off the beta version of that game correct?
---
Macy\*s operates this way as well, always has. The store constantly has bullshit "sales" that brings the items into the range of "mildly overpriced." Anything not on sale is the rube price.
---
Went back, no more armor parts showed up. But the vendor still had the lining. 
---
Kc?
---
Did anyone else get excited and thought this was a MGS reference? Haha
---
Isn't marine armour crap? I swear its worse than every other armour out there. I've had tons of pieces of it and never once has it been better than my current armour. And yes I'm talking about lvl 45-50 stuff. 
---
Kill any animal, and cook the meat with wood scraps at any cooking station. There’s a few in flatwoods. And you can build one in your camp for minimal resources. 
---
This is scummy af. I’ve always hated this kind of thing, even in WoW and Diablo when chat would be spammed with third party sites for buying gold with real money.
---
No idea why this guys would post a public video endorsing it, I hope his account gets banned.
---
However, that being said, this doesnt mean all youtubers are responsible for the games bad name.
---
Pretty much every source available(Not just youtube) review bombed this game on release in unison. The game has issues and most of the hate was well deserved at the time, in my opinion.
---
Yeah, I know everyone has dreams of being the Walmart of the Wasteland.....lol
---
If our bases were indestructible, sure, no problem.
---
But as it sits right now..........charge 1% more than they paid at another place, let the FAT MAN rain begin!
---
Happened to me 3 times now. I’ve wasted so much ammo. Sucks. 
---
Pick things you see growing and kill various animals.  When you get your first vegetable or piece of meat from something you learn a recipe.  Did you do the Flatwood responder quests?  They teach you about cooking.
---
Sorry,this game's market is already doomed by not having text chat or a player hub. The trading system is not that great either. Maximum 5 K /transaction?Come on...
---
If you are on ps4 i can sell you some prime 50 cal plans
---
Kill shit, get food, rinse and repeat. Anythimg is edible if you try hard enough
---
Yes, shoot the messanger, then impale them and set them on fire.
---
Well consider it karma for all the poor merchants we've killed for fun on other fallout games, haha
---
How does the queen even scale? Does it scale upon spawning? Does it scale dynamically depending how many are in combat w her? Sometimes the queen has million res when 1-2 players present. And then low def with 10 ppl there
---
So you fast travel to your camp box inside your camp? I dont think that happens when I fast travel back to mine. 
---
Agreed. I think I remember hearing they're bugged some way as well. Personally I just use frags, baseballs and plasma. Saves on having to craft them
---
PC, but I appreciate the offer.
---
You're also not talking like a dumbass 11 year old while simultaneously saying you speak 4 languages while questioning the reading comprehension of someone in a language you barely have any grasp of.
---
Also look in the Overseer stashes and in coolers and refrigerators.  Food is all over the place.
---
Thanks, I'm running a low health 1h melee which shreds her now, but I'm looking to find something that does a fair bit at range without having to respec.  The one consolation I've made is to get explosives 5 with my tse harpoon.  It's great but kinda slow, thinking what you said a. 50  cal would be better.  Just deciding between bloodied vs two shot. 
---
I like how you get downvoted for saying the game is unplayable, when that is an absolute fact for some people.
---
Lots of players still cannot even play the game. Yet you get downvoted for mentioning it, lol.
---
There is also one of the generator plans on a terminal at the Morgantown airport.  One of the quests from that area will direct you to it.  You can get the plans for the small water purifier that goes on the ground rather than in the water by taking over the Tyler County Dirt track workshop.  I think you get it from other workshops as well, but that one is in an early area.  Worth doing to get the plan even if you abandon it afterwards.
---
Same thing happened with a gun I wanted to mod. Bought the mod, but was unable to place it even though it looked like I had the green light. Your perk card has to be high enough to mod the weapon. Seems like the opposite of the point of buying the mod, but that’s how it is lol
---
So buying mods only saves you the resources to build it now. Which, with enough farming, might as well just save your caps. 
---
I go with helper. I have met some interesting people on the game being helpful. Some days I ignore everyone and grind. But I leave items in the overseers cache in Flatwoods and it helps people. I'm level 29. So if I can't sell it or scrap it, I gift it. Makes me happy.  I really like the ps4 community.  I was killed 7 times once by a guy with an axe. Other than that, very positive experiences with other players. 
---
You fast travel a certain distance in front of it.. Try putting it further back than where you want to spawn. Like 10/15 yards
---
I preferred to use my exploding gauss rifle mainly through out the fight. I also carried an exploding lever action as well as a two shot handmade just in case. Granted the best choice lies in legendary weaponry but not wholely a necessity. Gauss rifles have some pretty good dmg, affected by Rifleman perks but the ammo is quite heavy.
---
Hello Rose.  I've been trying to get back to that area the last little bit but the servers kept dumping me.   I tried to draw a circle around the area on my butcher job with Paint.   To give a better description.   You know the two lakes by the lumber mill south of Vault 76.   I checked for firecap there and when I didn't find any I headed roughly east towards Slocum Joes as I know you can find some there.   The area is a dirt clearing that is an obvious circle.   I didn't know this was that much of a mystery or I would have taken some pictures.    I will try to get back to that spot once the servers come back up and take a proper picture.   The bottom blue icon is Slocum Joes.

And if you visit it and stay, they’ll track you down.  It’s what happened to me.  Mine was literally near the bottom of the map with nothing significant around.  I saw the guy on the map in the forest, started doing some crafting and moving some stuff around and boom, there he is at my camp.  
---
It’s pretty easy to gauge where camps are if you pay attention.
---
I'm going to Alpha in 20 mins.  So Queen up in 50.

---
Thanks 
---
Instead of shooting wanted people, follow them around and sing whatever comes on the radio.
---
Forget gunfights
---
**Modern problems require modern solutions**
---
If you run twisted muscles mutation then your better off with bloodied or furious over two shot
---
It’s all good 
---
Picking up Cannibal helps alot. 
---
I didn't farm the game to get the best gun to not use it because other people wanna attack the same shit I attack. Basically I'm the big croc and I eat 1st, there's plenty of food elsewhere. But because I'm bigger than you I get 1st dibs. Your weak mind wants fairness and ya still get Darwinism. 
---
Suppose so at least you still get the sneak attack bonus 
---
You will get destroyed in pvp on that controller 
---
 Get the good boy perk and go on the Dog food diet.
---
Np just know theres no going back, 50 cal has no standard reciever in game so if you put prime on you can not take it off
---
As an unarmed build, I have to rush in and whackyinflattablearmflaingtubeman slap all enemies before the TSE guys get in.
---
Challenge accepted we will hunt you for a few weeks.  I hope you have caps.  We have your gamer tag.
---
Super, I do, appreciate that info. 
---
Same now I hide out under bridges
---
Is there an epidemic of retardation in the community to assume player vending will be camp specific? It CANNOT be something at your camp with 24 per server. It has to be a hub, or it's useless. 
---
Am I missing the Bethesda factor in my calculations? 
---
Ty
---
If you build over a cliff and put your CAMP module inside you may find yourself being dropped to your death.  I have had this happen many times.
---
nukes should auto spawn scorched and a few scorchbeasts similar to the fort defiance event. that way, almost anywhere you nuke is viable. the way it is right now, the only worthwhile place to drop them is FSP of whitesprings. everything else is just a waste of time
---
no, its a beta version of the editing tools which can see the relationships between entities and recipes and quests and stuff for the current version of the game.
---
Some of them are outright wrong. One says it's facing west, when it's actually north.
---
1000 atoms per 10 caps 😂
---
Ha exactly.. Just put it on a higher plane
---
I should clarify it happens when you first log in before your camp spawns.
---
No problem. Not much info there to be honest. 
---
The rational there is that twisted muscles lowers gun accuracy, two shot by nature reduces accuracy and increases recoil. With twisted muscles thrown in there it makes hitting anything down range with an automatic a pretty laughable affair. 
---
Have you tried that TSE harpoon our with the fletched mod? I hear that’s supposed to be pretty dam bad ass 
---
Years ago i was on the seller side at one game. So not only 5$ a day... It was lot more. Nobody will believe it how many streamers and YouTube guys you met buying stuff from you. 
---
Beside that I Am sure the black market for fallout76 will be broke soon. The hype is at his end and the duping destroys prices. 
---
They are just going to go to a friend's base and then you're the wanted one.
---
Ass U Ming!

Add KingDededeYT on psn

 A still would be a cool DLC addition.

tried fort defiance and starting the event there? i havnt seen anyone nuke that yet to see if it amounts to anything
---
I'd love some low-hanging fruit fixes, like:
---
- Show how much ammo you currently have when you are on the ammo crafting screen.
---
- Make "favorites" impossible to scrap/trade/sell, or otherwise be able to lock them.
---
- Show unit and total weight, or be able to sort in some way so you can actually see what's taking up the most space. (Bonus if you have a weight perk and can show how much the reduction is).
---
- Let us craft in power armor. Maybe it doesn't make actual game sense to allow it, but who cares. It's just a massive annoyance to have to hop in and out of it.
---
- On that note, a hotkey or favorite-wheel option for the power armor chassis would be wonderful.
---
- Better sorting for AID items. Spoil option is useless because food is mixed in with health/buff/non-perishable items so you probably have to scroll through 2/3rds of the list and scan the condition bars to even find the spoiled food, which is basically what you have to do anyway when it's default sorted. It should just have the most spoiled food at the top, where you might be able to quickly grab something before it rots. Same for Food/Drink/HP items really. Just let me quickly see what will give me the thing I need without scrolling down through the entire list and checking the stats of each item.
---
- Let us have some easy reminder to eat/drink before we are actually taking damage or whatever because of it. Or just have the tiny meters persistent. I don't understand why they are hidden when a quarter of the screen is usually filled up with every single quest task you've picked up.
---
Isn't there a deathclaw island? That would be cool. Even something in the marshes or the water park would be fun.
---
Give us homemade nuka cola recipes too!
---
But a BlackBerry or cranberry bog wine would be cool!
---
Yeah, that's ok by me. Aside from the queen, I can melt everything else in the game with something other than a bloodied explosive. Plus it's not like ultracite and flux are all that rare, especially factoring in ammosmith/superduper.
---
Lucky Break, White Knight and Ricochet.  I never repair armour.
---
I think that plan is somewhat common. Maybe it’s just RNG but I’ve seen it 3-4 times so far.
---
As far as the grenades themselves, they hit like a truck if the clusters hit. I do have a rank of Grenadier though, it seems to help.
---
So good luck, also if you happen to be on Xbox I can always help you out when I get back home in a week and half or so.
---
 “youtubers” are not a monolithic this group and the one you’ve linked...doesn’t have a video history of criticizing the game.  
---
Saw a dude with a 2-shot explosive GATLING.  Doing 280 per shot.
---
So, these editing tools shows the drop table of the quest but does it show the actaul drop chance? Or is it plausible that they have the drop chance currently set at 0?
---
And a 'please execute me, I want to clear my bounty' emote
---
Yeah, that's what I've got it nodded to now.  It is nice, but I like faster weapons.  It does look cool though. 
---
Lets even build into the water!!! We should make this a place for all forward thinkers and artists! We can call it.....
---
*Rapture*.
---
In all seriousness, sounds fun!
---
While I like the idea of the different kinds of wine, I'd be happy with just one, even if it uses blackberries, mutfruit, and cranberries to just make a generic red.
---
Thanks man you’re free to join as we only have 1 guy so far
---
Well that's different. 
---
You have my (Grognak's) axe.
---
Get both and see how the TSE's...variable...accuracy works for your playstyle. If you VATS, forget TSE basically. If you aim, it may/may not work depending on whether you're using rank 3 Stabilized.
---
If your looking for an ammo efficient heavy then I’d recommend that Gatling gun and go for the prime receiver. 
---
From what I saw all the settings were the same for all the paint plans, so not sure what the deal is.
---
Well that's incredibly disappointing and lazy... thanks for the answer at least. 
---
Can I get a duped furious power fist? I don't use guns. The duping doesn't affect me personally since I only get the 1400 vendor cap daily.
---
My camp is a small outpost, and I don't fast travel anymore so as to continue enjoying the game.
---
Even though whitespring is chalk full of TSE, I'm still able to enjoy the game just fine. 
---

---
How to open people up for pvp.
---
Get wanted status
---
Keep using someone else's base.
---
Have pacifist nuke non wanted players base.
---
Kill, repeat.
---
I saw a 480 bounty once. Took a screenshot I was so surprised.
---
One thing I didnt see that absolutely needs to change is that the trade key is the jump key and this cant be changed in the settings. Or make it so you cant trade in combat.
---
Anything to make the accidental trade window opening mid combat stop.
---
If I want to get the flux mats I kinda have to.  Sorry, maybe when Bethesda fixes it’s loot instancing.
---
It seems it is only obtainable on PC currently.  People have tested it with duped tech documents (6000+) and only got initiate on PS4.  I would assume that they are indeed waiting on the faction dlc to provide the new paints and camp items.
---
Nothing wrong with it if they're still doing work. However, if just their turrets kill it they don't get xp afaik. 
---
Try and join up?
---
Get the cannibal perk
---
Agreed. Cannibal and there are perks that remove the rads you get from food and water.
---
That means someone sold their All Rise to the bunker, it was not carrying it naturally.
---
Just don't try and fight the queen with an unarmed build
---
You conceded the argument a while ago, but thanks for conceding it again I guess.  I don't mind taking two wins for the price of one!
---
Just a guess as I can’t login right now, but build the first stair up, place the half floor on the top, drop another set of stairs next to it, go to the top and drop another half floor and put your stairs on it going down to the first set and remove the second set and such.  Could do it with the quarters too so you don’t have crap sticking out to the side if you can’t remove the floor connectors.
---
Goddammit. This is exactly what my husband said to me when I built under a bridge. 
---
Salute!
---
nice
---
a company HAS done this. the creators of Escape from Tarkov or whatever it's called. Look it up.
---
I'd set it up so that for Ghouls the irradiated part of your health bar regenerates, but consumes a bit of radiation when it does. When the bar gets to 100% radiation you still die because you become feral.
---
Super Mutants I'd set up so they have significantly more health than humans, and extremely high resistance to limb damage, disease and radiation, but can't mutate. They wouldn't be able to use power armor, but would be able to use all perks that require power armor as if they were wearing it.
---
Stack two long posts on top in one corner, remove the lower one, snap in the second stairwell, remove second post. 
---
Kill everything 
---
Tell me more about the free cat ,please. 
---
Yeah, it's still fun!
---
Wow that's actually pretty awesome! I need to find a way to start farming caps :O.
---
If it was the person that nuked whitesprings you have zero right to bitch they are just making sure to get some farm out of their effort.   
---
If it is not nor are they teamed well go for it. But literally shitheads that run around with their derpy ass pump expos one shotting everything sucks when you are the one that dropped the nuke and you get nothing. 
---
* Dr. Evil laugh *
---
I always drop the essentials: radaway, stims, food and water. Ammo too If I notice what gun they use. I often see low levels struggling to keep workshops, so I jump in and help.
---
Ended up with some food friends in game because of it! 
---
emmm. we set up camp after nuking whitespring because  we need antiradiation shower, we need quick access to stash, access to chem lab to prepare stable flux etc etc.
---
I can see many players using our camp during grinding.
---
Oh that's crazy I just posted a very similar thing - hadn't seen this suggestion up here before.
---
My only difference was that I was thinking exp to team members should probably be partial to avoid being unbalanced (particularly for large groups) - but either way would be great to see some kind of party experience for kills for co-op players. No more worrying about "tagging" etc.
---
Can’t say for sure but I doubt that it’s not based off when she spawns because there would be 1-2 people there. I believe it’s a dynamic buff that fluctuates depending on how many people are there, although I think her resistance doesn’t decrease when people leave. 
---
Thanks, I'll give both a shot and see.  Also seeing how I can add stabilized.  Might have to ditch my last qol perk. 
---
No, I am too. Been playing about a week, lvl 13 I think. No guides or wikis or streams, just good ole fashioned blind rpg'ing. 
---
so they're banning Cheat Engine and Reshade but not mods... and you're seeing that as "they won't do jack"?
---
This is exactly my story, and level!
---
Why rush it? I never understood why so many people race through games, or cheat to get high level things. Why can't they enjoy the ride, even if it takes them a bit longer?
---
Glad I'm not the only one at this low a level who has been playing since beta. Makes me feel less weird.
---
Just saying it looks like you’re taking this way too seriously 
---
Interesting, yeah that is weird considering me and my buddy turned in 300 data we collected over the last few days and all we ended up with in terms of paints was 7 or so intiate paints.
---
This is photoshop, It's impossible to find a Glowing Raptor
---
Yeah that’s what we have resorted to doing 
---
I'm glad you posted this. Watch this last night and when he said " I dupped candy " I thbs downed and watched something else. It's not the duping but he complained about server stability and like if you care about the servers crashing stop duping. Can't complain about something when you're part of the problem. 
---
I just got in today, not fixed
---
Damn Dragon Balls...
---
Yep this is it thanks
---
What is that?? I recall about a month ago I saw one when j was level 13 and freaked out. I shot it and it teleported away!
---
&gt;Excluding explosive guns, what type of weapon should I focus on. I am not a sneak type of player. I would like to get into vats since I never used it with melee.
---
I'm a stealth sniper, however if I were to change focus it'd be on shotguns due to the Enforcer perk. Shotguns do great damage *and* with that perk can make nearly any enemy totally harmless due to limb crippling. 
---
If that isn't up your alley, I would go with something high shots per minute for the bloody mess perk. 
---
&gt;Also how do you handle the 4-5 charging leaping ghouls as a ranged gun player and no pick up weight due to lack of strength?
---
Depending on the spec you go, you may still have str. My sniper build looks like it will have at least 5 strength due to shotgun perks. If I were to go Shotgun I would have even more strength. 
---
Either way, I use shotguns close range or melee. 
---
You have contracted Swamp Gas. -2 Charisma. 
---
See the picture in this article: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Nuka-Girl
---
You really can't take it off? I thought you could in 4 when you got it. That's a bummer.
---
Since these people likely own mules to store all that shit, I Don't think just deleting the items or even delete the character currently holding the dupes would be enough. Bethesda should simply wipe their account clean as if it was new if they are not permabanned. 
---
Also for the people who didn't dupe but clearly knew the equipement they bought was duped and still went on with the purchase, they're just as guilty as the duper and should not be spared.
---
The game might be broken but it should not mean you are allowed to take advantage of it in any way.
---
Problem is alot of unsuspected buyers could end up with this treatment but id say fixing this kind of situation goes a long way and at least you learned to be more careful in the future. The greater good is more imortant than the individual.
---
This is exactly what I do. I drop everything in sight and then let others finish them or get their hits in. Such a good idea. I’m happy to see others doing this. 
---
uh... the caps are in the game. So they have the right to ban people for selling caps. It doesn't matter what these people are claiming. They aren't giving ANYTHING in return for the money EXCEPT the caps.
---
tato vodka, yummy
---
My Flatwoods camp only rarely gets attacked - usually a couple of ghouls and the occasional mole rats.
---
I would be very concerned, though, about griefers killing a pet Moo Moo there. 
---
Destroy every base.
---
Use Radaway, you have birdbones  :-) 
---
This... is an excellent idea!
---
Most of us are just happy other people are playing the game. 
---
i once got an instigating perk on a mini chainsaw thing that i found. i dued that to tag for a while cuz you can just run around holding click and you do basically no damage 
---
On that note, can anyone tell me what it means by food produced in a workshop? Is that, like, the number of edible plants that grow on the premises?
---
Same same same! Yep. 
---
I didn't even think of it, we should be able to make bloody marries!
---
PSA: As soon as the player is dead, additional damage to his camp makes you wanted. Don’t ask how I know...
---
sorry if i'm blind but in the link, I can't se the picture or see info about her with the hood cap thing inside her helmet?
---
Are you addicted to any chems
---
Not seeing a lot of animals. Mostly ghouls. And mutants. 
---
All I’m saying is if u set up camp outside the downstairs door I’m gonna destroy your fucking camp every time, just fucking grind the shit like everyone else.  Stop being fucking lazy
---
It's weird how there's a main story quest in every region except toxic valley.
---
1. Build CAMP as close as possible to assailant. 
---
2. Build artillery piece and grab your markers
---
3. ????
---
4. Profit.
---
carve a hole in the melon, pour some booze in it, makes a nice little cocktail
---
Maybe try taking an addictol 
---
Great point, i agree. The challenge factor drops off quickly. I told myself I wouldn't devolve into server hopping for plans and farming legendaries,  but there's not much else. I'm hopeful it'll get better. 
---
Ditto. I tend to just take their legs out as they are mostly harmless once they are on the ground. When I started farming White Springs it was because that was the best I could now that I'm higher level it's to allow others to get their tags in...then wade in with my 3* axe for cleanup once the tagging is done. Good times for all when cooperation occurs! 
---
No clue. I was exploring and gathering each time.
---
Hmm, never thought of using the vault corpse.  Will have to start using that one.  I normally just look to see if there are any low levels at the overseers camp and just pay a visit.
---
Sadly, none that I know of. I remember I tried placing the fireplace on my first floor, but every time I placed it, it would vanish. Never thought to look on my second floor for all three of them until I heard that power armour stations can end up on the roof. 
---
And u can pay the price in mats for being a lazy jackoff

You can get a big budget by getting logged out and your base being stored. It's how you see ppl with 100 turrets

I can't wait till someone blows up my base and the uses the "in sorry" emote
---
I’m level 60 but I’m in the same boat. I’ve just recently started entering nuke zones so I’ve leveled up a bit faster, but yeah I’ve not even entered a silo yet. I don’t have an explosive weapon yet. 
---
OHHHH. I misunderstood you. I thought you meant removing the clear helmet and that she never wore the clear helmet. That was what I thought when I saw it myself and I went to go check and found those pictures.
---
 Sorry.
---
Yeah I don't recall the hood cap thing in 4 at all...
---
To point number four on your list, if you get disconnected you lose all progress on the next part of whatever quest your on.
---
So if you just spent 45 minutes on part of a quest something and you get disconnected, be prepared to spend another 45 minutes doing it again.
---
Also any items you used that are quest specific will not be returned to you if you get disconnected.
---
You can look at other post to see how often people get disconnected, it varies a lot.
---
No, just anti-armor one star.

I'm trying to think I'm like never in the Forrest area region

Indeed, thanks a lot! Seems I was kindof on the right track with my cards :)

I have melee/ non stealth rifle character.  
---
And when I'm just roaming around I use unarmed weapons with the corresponding perk as well as incisor and martial artist. The rest of my strength goes into weight reduction. Then I switch my perks out to use 2 handed for nuke zones. Then I have rifles for anything I dont want to get face to face with and those perks are just for damage. Works pretty good for me. But regardless of what you do having an offhand melee weapon is pretty handy. Most of my first 40  levels was spent with a death tambo at my side. 
---
Team? Sending you an inv

Do you know about moving the camp object around to change your spawn? It's not super straight forward but it does seem to change the fast travel target spot. You just have to try a couple of spots out (move then fast travel back to camp)
---
I don’t cheat or dupe and I’ve found this game to be amazing. Playing it normally is fun because I have something to work for. 
---
Wouldnt that show in effects page under stats? Right now its not showing anything...but im looking for addictal right this moment. 
---
Alright made it back in.   That was a short maintenance.   I found the spot this time it was full of bloatfly's and scorch beast guano piles.    [Here](https://imgur.com/a/skdLs9e) is the spot along with a picture of the ID Card and Password.   I hope this helps.

Anyone know what button it is on PS4?  I just level 16 and this post made me realize that I've haven't used VATS yet.

I thought you put me on ignore. Hmm..

known, not sure if bug or feature. it does actually boost gun accuracy both in and out of vats, though, so its worth keeping on

&gt;I'm not assuming, in the small time we've exchanged points a small consensus has happened with my original comment of don't buy with real money and you and the other guys comment who mentioned buy with real currency.
---
you're getting your wires crossed. what I meant by "you're assuming that, erroneously" is that I never said using in-game currency makes you a manchild. it's asinine to assume that. you have to fast travel at the very least, like you yourself pointed out.
---
what I meant was that aggregating value to make-believe currency and assuming it creates a real market that people have to respect, now THAT makes you a manchild.
---
&gt;I have a shred of evidence that just a small sample size disagree with paying more money to win at a game that they have already payed for.
---
because that's the hivemind consensus on a hivemind sub. to have a real market you need to back it up with real currency. otherwise it's just make-believe. you can't have both, it's contradictory. so your "small sample" means squat because these people want something that's impossible.
---
&gt;Pay to win is never a good idea. If we create your market and create this real world currency market your so eagerly defending, a lot of players will quit.
---
do you understand what p2w means? you can get legendaries without paying for them. I don't think p2w is even possible in Fo76 as it is. now if someone doesn't want/can't farm for months and the market is able and willing to supply their demands, that's their prerogative.

I gave a LVL 6 player a pimped out lvl 5 hunting rifle (all mods with a long recon scope) and 400 rounds of ammo to go with it, and all my excess plans and recipes.  Hopefully it helped him out.

I usually try to do this at least once every time I play.

They've replied in this thread. As to whether they actually do anything about it...

Bots on Parade is another one.  It tends to trigger when you are at the Lewisburg train station. The premise of the event is to activate some nearby bots.

You do realize the games are data that never leaves BSG’s servers. Nothing about real world markets for caps are “outside of their game”.

But I dig the irony.

I will clean it up and add to it then post it for you / others.

Works 2 ways though, I helped a level 30 guy out with his workshop as I was passing by, he was getting attacked by super mutants, was very happy with a level 30 sniper I just happened to have and a load of Stims. Likely not so happy when my presence summoned a level 80 scorchbeast as his next defend the workshop event....

Between Flatwoods and the overseers camp, there’s three mongrels that spawn. The farm east of the Overseer’s camp, there’s one or two radstags that spawn.

Yes, this price is a steal, especially with constant updates and how awesome the new DLC sounds like it could possibly be. If you are ok with not great graphics and occasional bugs and disconnects, there is no reason not to get it.

If it's in the chassis, it can. Atom mark on chassis washes off after putting it in the stash.
---
Charleston Landfill has a built in industrial water purifier. You can fill up on them there, it’s south from flatwoods. I suggest planting razor grain and getting a water spout at your base. You can boil the water and then make razorgrain soup which gives you food AND water when you eat it.

Do you have the black BOS officer underarmor?

Huntersville area is really close and it also has a lead deposit near it
---
I won't lie. I found the Eyed Piper (what people seem to be calling the eyebot leading the rad rats) and took a short video that ended up being heavily glitched (never found out why). Then I killed the bot and the rats. The XP wasn't really worth it lol
---
A few questions.. How much budget did you have free before you tamed and how much after? Does it eat anything? Can it die of hunger? How far from your CAMP were you when you tamed and were you really close to it? Did you walk it back to CAMP and was there a selection to send it to CAMP? 
---
Loot fridges and kitchens in houses. Pick fruits and veggies at farms. Also check kitchens for green recipe books so you can cook more things.
---
Most stuff just needs boiled water or wood. You have the water pump plans by default. Pop a rad x and pump a ton (or find a river and collect the water, this is faster than pumping), then go to a cook stove or camp stove and boil it all. Then you can make soup or drinks with plants you picked. Soot flower tea for example.

Buying a legendary with real money is pay to win.

Or if you want to sell things, you can build your camp at a spot people will pass by often. Y'know, like how it would work in real life?

Instead of having a huge marker.
---
I find it funny you say grind like everyone else when the xp was nerfed.
---
Ppl can't grind it like everyone else did.
---
Oh and they nerfed the legendary spawns too.
---
Plenty of good folks on PC... from what hear way more than in PS or XBox where there are more teens...
---
&gt;But it's an exploit that allowed a ton of people to not have to barter with someone who has the free time and luck to go find great stuff, and then completely control the prices on the "market". 
---
What's wrong with this? It's the same in every games with player driven markets such as mmos. 
---
If someone has the means to dedicate day and night farming for the best things to sell then this player earned its monopoly over a section market so long as it's done in a legitimate way.
---
Server hop and check display cabinets in the house in Harper's ferry.  Eventually, you will have the entire set 
---
That is a solid point.
---
Well it's still too early but if you like fallout you can get quite some time in this game to complete and reach high lvl or even get some legendary items.  
---
It still misses endgame though but updates may fix this.  
---
Try doing BoS events like: Line in the Sand, Census Violence, etc. They have a chance to drop BoS plans. Thats how I got the BoS officer suit (black underarmor)
---
Yup, that IS endgame. Boring as hell, I have no urge to play anymore. 
---
TIL
---
Ive been messing with those damn prebuilt stairs for hours, and from what ive been able to figure out they only snap to objects two ways.
---
The bottom level will only snap to the foundation (ground floor). 
---
The top level will only snap to an upper floor. 
---
That means, you have to build a regular stair set on the second floor, start building a third floor to where it will meet up with the prebuilt stairs like you want it to, then snap the prebuilt stairs to the third floor.
---
The thing is, is that the prebuilt stairs are techically floating from the third floor, and they arent actually connected to the second floor. so you wont be able to remove that first set of stairs.
---
How does gun-fu interact with melee?

Haha sorry I didn't make it clear in the post 
---
tip to wanted players: if someone drops an orbital beacon on you,  take your own hp very low, the second you get downed, every subsequent explosion that touches your base gives the attacker a bounty.  
---
They'll get a bigger bounty than you had in all likelihood and you can take them out and profit on it.

Welcome back. I made new characters since I was repeating the first responders quest “thirst things first”, which can only be done once per character. It took about  10-15 minutes per character if I rushed the vault, ran straight to flatwoods and did the quest, then deleted and repeated.
---
Wood is everywhere.

Seeing some people who power leveled to finish everything already complaining about being bored, I'm happy taking my time.
---
They really went for the meth dealers/cooks in actual West Virginia (lookup "Meth Storm"), and actually did a pretty good job of cleaning up local production/distribution. And now there's shit tons of imported drug cartel meth there to replace it. So yeah, going for the dealers is pretty established to not even work in the first place. 
---
Furthermore, it's fundamentally better for things like security flaws to get more exposure rather than less. Exceptions are made so devs have time to produce fixes, but generally not if something is already "in the wild". And sometimes devs don't even know what's going on until they watch a youtube video on how to do it. The flipside is that if only a few people know, maybe it won't create enough of a problem for them to actually care about fixing it.
---
I am certainly not encouraging or supporting cheating, but there really is not any advantage to keeping bugs like this under wraps when they are being actively exploited.
---
Why can’t I find people like you and ones mentioned by the OP? 
---
I see asshats fairly regularly. 
---
Honestly did not know that, thanks.

Added
---
I can also add that the camp module is the almost exact spawn point of any pet you tame.And after that they generally roam around it.
---
I was moving it around to get a better spawn ,and discovered my deathclaw on the roof and in the bedroom lol.
---
Ouch. I'm guessing that  can be either due to a server issue or through a temporary unstable internet connection. Is there anything that can be done to mitigate the results, like stashing or something that will save some items in case something happens?
---
Go test it lol. It is a fact. 
---
Some dickbags that are almost 300 came to my camp
---
 (i stopped farming at 110), and tried destroying it. Four man team, both of our camps were on Whitesprings Golf Course. I just stealthed my way to their camp and decimated it. They kept repairing while looking for me (I marsupialed into a nearby tree), I kept destroying it. The four man team finally caved and left. 
---
Bonus: Some good samaritans came by and manually repaired 90% of my base. Bless their souls.
---
Where do I start
---
"Plan: Cooler" is definitely on the Harper's Ferry vendor list for around 700, but as said above it's prob worth stacking some workshop defense events. 
---
You were, and as for your build, you are. I don't wanna comment too much on it as it's luckily preference based so there are no "cookie cutter" builds out there, but you may want to drop certain perks for ones that help you more. All Night Long and Travel Agent could for instance easily be dropped for another flat 10% damage through Bloody Mess with some respeccing. Rather than using Good Doggy late game, I'd also suggest speccing for something like Photosynthetic or Sunkissed (HP/Rad Regen), at least during day time.
---
Don't wanna shamelessly plug anything here, but if you search my username here on youtube, I did a build video for my stealth build about a month ago which is quite similar to yours. Might be able to find some inspiration there. That being said, after respeccing was introduced, I did make some alterations to said build and I've yet to post the update there.
---
In any case, the value of a card such as Travel Agent is easily negilible (travelling across the entire map would require you to kill a couple Super Mutants to get the amount of caps you saved) and there might be some better quality of life choices for you to either increase your gameplay or quality of life :)
---
Yep, and the TP in the bathroom is fixed.
---
I have found TP backwards in a bunch of locations though. 😜
---
Now it makes sense how that song was chosen.
---
This should be top coment in the whole sub.
---
They should fix that too. If you don't want to PvP I don't see why it's fine to people to come and wreck your camp on a whim. Or just make the repairs free. Really sucks when someone does this and you happen to be out of Steel or something.
---
Addictol worked!!!! 
---
No the goshin heck it isn't! Well, maybe some that's diluted if i see some lowbies, but you gots to pay for the good stuff and mine is the best!
---
that implies the item is unobtainable otherwise
---
no
---
I'm hoping they'd be smart enough to do this after they fix the duplication glitch though and somehow find a way to reset everyone's multiple stacked legendaries to 1

there's no market if it's not backed by irl money. otherwise it's just manchildren playing with make-believe currency.

I don't use real money I use in game money. So if I'm not using real money then I am the otherwise.

Yesssss

yep yep

Yep this is the way to go there's dog food everywhere and doesn't spoil.

Just make it so every time you damage a vending machine, you permanently pay 20% higher at all machines.

Duping isn't patched because im still doing it. And i gave away HUNDREDS dragons (TSE shotgun). I've been doing it since release.  Muahahahaha and i will __keep__ on doing it. Because BGS Does __NOT__ have the tools to do __anything__ about it.
---
Not on you, I used the mirv a bunch in fo4 and it's really buggy in 76 :( like it explodes midair a few feet away from me most of the time. I really hope they fix it. But as you said, the standard fatman works a lot better so that's a plus.
---
O no baby what is you doing
---
&gt; Im always running pacifist, and many times Ive become wanted by accidentally hitting someones wall or workstations when trying to help defend against mobs. Maybe theres a diff between workshops and camps though.  
---
  
---
Sounds like a bug? Double check to make sure pacifist is actually on?  
---
I've thrown grenades and fired fatmans directly at camps and workshops with no effect in pacifist mode, as it should be.

Quad single action revolver.... worst/longest loading sequence ever, seriously check the you tube vids.... lol

I'd love it if the Pip-Boy app had a radio function, because there are moments where I want to feel like I am in post-apocalyptic West Virginia and listening to my Pip.

right... the farming feels like Diablo except worse because you can hold more items in Diablo.. 99% is garbage

I’m actually selling a heavy polymer combat Left Leg, if you’re interested.

The plan spawns (along with other items) at the NAR Repair Yard west of Watoga. There’s another spawn point between there and Watoga in a box car. It’s not common however.

Quad pump action shotgun. 
---
No worries my friend. Other tips I have found bos vendor in watoga sells T-45, T-51b and rarely T-60 mod plans like jet pack calibrated shocks etc. Camden Park sells Excavator mod plans like previous comment :). Make loads of money when I find them. Rare chances for them to spawn.
---
uh... I've taken control of the munitions factory multiple times and only had a scorchbeast defense quest once. and that didn't happen til I was like level 70.
---
Can you make me one?

Are you on now ?

You shouldn't be getting downvotes that's fine man. Some of us only carry our explosive weapon so we can loot more

What are you looking to have spawn?

South of 96 there’s a copper deposit.

Low level enemy will spawn NW of that.

South of that I’ve had Mothman spawn twice.

You mean the one that gave us seven different vendor factions, and put them so you have to travel all over the map to visit them all? That Bethesda factor?
---
&gt;aggregating value to make-believe currency and assuming it creates a real market that people have to respect, now THAT makes you a manchild.
---
if you fit the entire description and not just part of it, then yeah, pretty much.
---
you're essentially expecting people to partake in your roleplaying and calling out anyone that refuses to. you're also fervently asking for a market while simultaneously ignoring everything that it takes to create an actual market.
---
Killed my first yesterday with a good old shotgun and also got nada. 
---
Nope pay to win is obtaining an in game item that gives you an edge, advantage or as it states win. Buying a 2SE weapon marks all those. Your talking about paying to unlock. You keep bringing up dark souls if I buy a high grade weapon and enough souls to level substantially I have paid to win my game. 
---
Buying a gun that can one shot 99% of players and enemies in the game without even maxing perks is a win. 
---
If you disagree, you obviously haven't played much.

On another video, he says, "I don't know how these Player Vending Machines are going to work! I mean, everyone and their *mother* is duping in this game."

Also if you open your pipboy while falling and close it when you touch the ground it will also cancel it.

Teaming is buggy for me too, try using Enter and arrows instead of clicking with mouse. That helped me.

What the acual Fuck... come on guys
---
It's not about the items, it's about the progress. So you have a class that takes four steps at each step takes 45 minutes. If you're on step two and halfway done with it and you get disconnected, when you reconnect you have to start over on step two from where ever it's bonds you into the world.
---
I would suggest you look up the DMV quest and the disconnect issues people of had with that. That will give you an idea of your worst case scenario.
---
I just remembered, as well if you are taking a workshop and you get disconnected You will lose the workshop.
---
If you start a Bossfight, and get disconnected. unless you Are in a group with someone you will not be able to reconnect to the same server to finish the Bossfight.
---
I tried both the actual radio stations for a bit but really tired of them pretty quick. Turns out the subtle in-game music is actually not too bad.
---
Look at the prices the shit hole website sells stuff for. $50 for a 2 shot black powder rifle???? What the fuck??????
---
That’s a bold move Cotton. 
---
Seriously I’m enjoying 76 but, I really don’t feel the urge to try different characters like I have with Fallout 4 or Skyrim. 
---
Getting killed costs caps? I thought you only lose caps if you had a bounty on you. I've been killed a few times and didn't notice losing anything.
---
Does this work with the “quick boy” also?
---
I've been able to join my last server a lot lately. Ever since I put my camp at q junk node far left side of map. I've noticed the same camp built into my spot quite a few times recently trying to get my camp to spawn. Even with waiting in between hitting the que again. Hopefully they can implement an actual que again system soon though. Holidays are over time for them to do some seriously needed work.
---
Not right now. I may be on later. 
---
Dupers and trolls don't care.  They'll rekt your base again and again just for the fun of it.
---
Thanks, but I use a controller like a weirdo so my mouse and keyboard don't respond ingame.
---
Similar to the pvp crucible in Destiny? I havent played in awhile but if I remember they implemented something similar so the legendaries wouldnt be so O.P. against low leveled players.
---
[Three-Dog, AWOOO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sci8JR3p-_k)
---
And Bethesda needs to use it.
---
and guess what's even better? they don't even need to hire people to fix the issues! there are people who are just going to eat it up and attack anyone dares to say a bad thing about the game!
---
Lol okay bud.
---
Not yours you troll looking hag with teeth that look like corn chips lol
---
Yeah, this may be just being ignorant to what's going on around me, but I've never seen or heard anyone that's duped in my server. I know it happens a lot and something needs to be done about the issue, but Id hope to believe that most players aren't doing this and just want to enjoy the game. 
---
Thank goodness that YouTube is the only known way to convey information about video game exploits, once it's banned Fallout 76 will finally be free!
---
Tesla rifle plan! Been looking for it for weeks. Fav gun so far but I want mods. 
---
Who knows.  I need one left in the bog which is Cranberry Glade.  It won’t unlock despite me taking a pic in front of the giant billboard.  I see that pic all the time in loading screens, mocking me
---
been playing since the game came out non-stop. and the very definition of p2w is getting an advantage through money that's unavailable otherwise.
---
like you pointed out, "pay2unlock" would be a better definition. in which case it's hardly unfair as you can get one by farming. I'd argue it's unfair *if* Bethesda was the one charging people to unlock it, but since that ain't the case, it's really not unfair.
---
From Bethesda* not emote
---
Also switching your weapon while falling cancels it. It’s the easiest one to do imo because you can do it at any point, not just right before you land. 
---

---
After playing a lot of ESO, and really trying to enjoy it, I honestly completely despise this system.
---
I find it incredibly dry and unfulfilling. I like sometimes finding enemies that make me nervous. I like finding enemies that I can effectively ignore because they are rightfully beneath me.
---
The ESO system makes me feel like I'm never really progressing, and despite many attempts, I simply cannot find enjoyment in it at all.
---
I’ve been all over those locations listed especially the water park and Grafton dam

Ouch, that’s pretty high up there with radium rifle with bonus damsel vs. supermutants

Oh, I didn’t know controller completely disabled KB and mouse.

“The more you know !”
---
I remember a random post somewhere telling players to leave unwanted items in / on the Responder corpse right outside of Vault 76, so that's what I do now.
---
Check there for shitloads of Stimpaks, RadAway, RadX (normal and Diluted), as well as ammo and scrap I don't need or want.
---
 Mmmm...nope.  What you actually said was that you think it is amoral for Bethesda to “nickel and dime” their playerbase.  But you keep moving them goalposts; it’s cool - easier than just admitting your argument is silly.
---
Side note: it’s demonstrably amoral because it violates the terms of service to which the person agreed to when they decided to engage with Bethesda.  Who owns the property.  And can do with and charge for whatever they please.
---
But I am sure this is the point where you totally prove to me how violating their agreement is really a morale act.
---
Absolutely! :D 
---
I'm honestly impressed that you people are flabbergasted at people cheating, exploiting the game, and selling in-game items. Have you people EVER played a multiplayer game before?
---
It would become the new "well what is it?" instantly.

I’ve been to The Galleria multiple times for quests too, it’s that two story mall, yet it still says I haven’t visited that either.  I’m not sure how to activate it so I just let it go for now.

Wife couldn't fast travel to my first camp without getting stuck in the foundations. I'd have to remove two foundations to get her out. 
---
Attaching an (x, y, z) "CampArrivalLocation" array to a camp is just too much work and way too hard. Lets cut this indie company some slack guys.
---
Unpolished turd of a game. 
---
There is less circlejerking on the_donald
---
New items added? I havent seen this anywhere. If they did add some stuff they really should announce it; positive press would be good atm.
---
As an fyi you'll probably get support issues if you blueprint it.
---
All the camp shit you listed was way too fucking cheap. Can't believe I'd say micro-transactions are too cheap but seriously it's fucking easy to get 350 atoms and the whole point of that store was so they could make constant money to fund updates.
---
It spawns in the mire during a random event where you can search someone’s grave. The club is common but the hammer is rare. Someone must’ve sold it lol. 
---
This is what you signed up for
---
I haven't played destiny since the first one so I couldn't say. I have no idea how their current system works. 
---
No I haven’t been there yet, I’ll check it out next time I can play. I’ve heard it’s good for picking up mutations as well!
---
\*pacifist mode
---
I'm role playing by using in game currency?. I'm ignoring a "BLACK Market" not a market. Your promoting the sales of items that hold no ownership to who is selling it. 
---
Okay I'm bored of circling. 
---
You want me to agree that if we're not using real life cash for sales it's not a market. If real life money is not involved it's not a trade or sale. It's manchildren playing with fake money. There can be no market if no real money is involved. 
---
All players with items that others are buying for caps is not a market. 
---
So quick question, if a player sells a plan for 5k caps. What is that?
---
Now if a player makes stimpacks and sells them. Conducts themselves well and ends up with repeat business from the same players, they buy some from them every day (players are doing this now and have specific camps to promote business) What is this called? 
---
Because it's not a market. 
---
It's not supply and demand, because its caps right?
---
That's because a player should it to the vendor. 
---
I'd absolutely love this! I bought it but didn't see the screenshots, so I didn't know about the ugly hood. It'd be nice if it didn't remove your underarmor when using the outfit as well, but one issue at a time I suppose.
---
I'm averaging about 1 level for every 3.5 hours played.
---
Thanks, I’ll go have a look. 
---
Weird that I have not randomly pressed that yet.  Thanks for the info
---
High lvl helped me when I started. Just paying it forward :)
---
I can help with some questions:
---
1. I can’t remember precisely how much, but pet definitely takes up camp budget. (Deathclaw takes up about half or 2/3 of size of what a turret will take, if I remember correctly) - however, you can still tame a pet if your camp budget is already maxed/close to max.
---
2. It does not need food or water. Maybe some love from you but not anything else. 
---
3 &amp;4.  I once tamed a giant lobster (can’t remember its name) from Toxic Valley and it started running off to the direction of my camp. I didn’t follow him as the journey would be too far lol. My camp is in the savage divide area and I found him already in my camp the next day when I logged in. 
---
5. The moment you press “tame” on an animal, a pop-up window will appear, prompting you to send it to camp and letting you know by doing this, this pet will replace whatever pet you have previously. 
---
In addition, be careful if your camp is near the cliff area because your pet can die. I had my deathclaw swan diving down the cliff to its demise...RIP Fredi. 
---
it's a cat called murgle it's located directly north of welch station at unmarked metal cabin (just follow the path and you'll find it)
---
I rocked the spiked ski-sword for a long time until I picked up blade of bastet. Lower level but I think it was 80-90 dmg and hard to beat for the weight.
---
Tinker yes. Requires 1 flux of some kind from memory.
---
reminds me of that somewhat recent post asking who else is an accidental asshole because a kid came up to him and said "Hello" and he accidentally used the "No" emote instead of the one he meant to.
---
YouTubers are the Emmanual Goldstein of the subreddit
---
You can craft them.
---
Clearly you haven't been looking hard enough! You gotta raise your luck stat as well.
---
Surprisingly, Bethesda manages to maintain this same rewarding feeling through the entire play through!
---
My last time in the glassed cavern was intense!
---
Although I’ve been in a lot of battles since then so it might not be too bad next time.
---
Bethesda are the only ones that CAN charge. Are you purposely missing the point that it's against the TOS and The Law to sell items that do NOT belong to you?
---
Hooray another older player like myself!  I camp back to find my camp destroyed by other players and my feelings were hurt.  Only us older folks with kids can have that kind of disappointment or, in your case, joy.
---
One. Somehow it survived the encounter.
---
Sometimes the vendors show not having caps for me even though I know damn sure they should. Selling something or walking away an back usually solves the issue. But as others have stated I'm pretty sure it's not linked by players. It's all self based time. So if you sell out a vendor to 0 come back 24hrs later an there is more caps.
---
Sweet, I’m surprised I haven’t heard of this before.
---
There's the sommerset special you get from some quest, though I've only had like a level15 one. Ignores 50% of armor, and anecdotally was way more effective than it should have been.
---
Is the paint intended to work with other armor like Marine, Metal, and Leather or is it just Combat?
---
It goes to show us fallout heads are chill peeps
---
This whole string of posts made me cringe super hard.
---
How long does stuff stay there for when you drop it? I dropped some fusion cores in a person's place after I had used his stuff and had a nap.
---
Last week ppl were amazed how I was level 30 with 100 hours played
---
Wait a second, assassin also reduces damage you do to yourself?  That would be ridiculous but funny. And actually accurate to the description 
---
I like to give tons of ammo when i run across new players.
---
I'm a melee guy, so it's useless to me.
---
Haha done with this xD looking through your posts and you have several posts on the bazaar H:legendaries W:Caps
---
Guess your just another man child!
---
All this and the very thing you are arguing against you actively involve yourself. 
---
Maybe it wouldn't be so funny if maybe one of your posts had asks for "Real Money" haha 
---
I'm out this is a joke now xD
---
That's great news for all!
---
I have the same issue, is it installed on a different drive to the launcher?
---
I have to launch the game using the .exe in the game folder now.
---
This isn't a top priority yet since the game still has  an unreleased dlc coming 1st quarter and tons of bugs. would love to see it though
---
I see what you mean, and that really sucks. From the sounds of it there's no real way around it unless the server works a bit better.
---
Ive seen them in a datamined lists (one mods, the other plans), so they must exist in the game, but whether its accessible or not is another question.
---
Pfft. I had a nightmare last night that large maggots crawled out of my skin.
---
I could feel it. It hurt. 
---
Their agreement doesn’t dictate morality. What I said was that it was just as moral for players to sell caps as it is for Bethesda to sell in game currency. They’re both fun money in different forms exchanged for real money. Arguably it is less moral for Bethesda to do so given that they’ve already been paid a sizeable amount of real money for the game itself. 
---
Is there a level cap for the plans to spawn like the handmade rifle? If so do you know what that is?
---
http://imgur.com/6RSihqa
---
As promised
---
I didn't even know it removed underarmour. I thought that was just a visual thing while the suit was equip
---
Pretty sure I got mine from claiming workshops. They award a random plan every time you claim one. 
---
Still don't have a regular toilet, though.
---
Cool build! Love the shot with the car hahah do you have any enemies spawning in your camp?
---
It's broken 
---
Not to mention constant incoming nuclear bombs nbd 
---
I really want the helmet and suit to be separate 
---
I feel almost obliged to help out people given that they too are persevering with the game and its current issues, unfortunately most people soil their suits and gap it the moment you approach.
---
We are a loosely organized volunteer organization. If you've got a pip boy, grit, and ammo you're good to go. Now do us proud!
---
I agree new stuff is going to take priority, just trying to think of ways to stop running into silent players constantly. 
---
Junkies ripper
---
I thought it would be nice if we could set up market stalls wherever, separate from our camp. Market stalls would show up on the map and you could plop them anywhere, including in named locations. That way we could pop them down in the big open platforms just outside of the Vault or in the Whitesprings courtyard or wherever.
---
Easily the ghoul Slayer's gamma gun. 
---
Sometimes if I wait about twenty minutes map markers show up, or if I re-log. This is one of the many things about this game that drives me around the bend. 
---
If you are buying 500 nuka colas for 200 caps, I have no sympathy for you if you get banned. You know exactly what you are doing.
---
I have my buddy run and gather up some should in whitespring during a nuke event then have him stand near a fence or wall. Pah-cheeeeeewwww. Usually pull 2500xp per mini nuke but got up 4500 and some change in the parking lot near the service building. Oh how Beautiful it is to watch the nuked ghouls get nuked. 😂
---
I’ve been having this problem too starting a couple days ago (though idk if it started right after a restart or just randomly).
---
 It’s a very annoying problem, but luckily you can still launch the game by directly opening the files, rather than through the launcher. I believe the game application is located in [bethesda launcher—&gt;game files—&gt;fallout 76—&gt;fallout 76 application] in your computer files, or something along those lines. I’m concerned that due to the bug I will not be able to update the game without reinstalling, but for now the workaround is better than nothing. 
---
It gets better xD W:Low level Legendary H:Caps 
---
Go buy one for real money if the markets so great xD
---
Bro why were you arguing if you don't even agree with it yourself. 
---
And all it takes is one teammate to shoot and boom you can attack the whole team you would be surprised how much loot you can get from this
---
Wildman Outfit &gt; Everything
---
Thanks. I tap out. 
---
Scripted languages are the Devil's work.
---
Trogdor!!
---
Half of these high level players don’t care. They’ll kill you regardless because they want your shit too. It’s very upsetting honestly. 
---
Or do a luck 10 build and farm perfectly preserved pie to sell.
---
Love my PC 
---
But am bummed for no Spider-Man and RDR2
---
I too am just playing this for now, I like the diverse scenery and very large open world.
---
This will do for now. Until the major mods for Fallout 4 (Capital Wasteland, Miami, Cascadia) and Skyrim (Beyond Skyrim, etc)
---
I’m really picky. I donated to the Kingdom Come prerelease, but haven’t played since Beta. Bought Witcher and LOTR but found them uninteresting after a week. 
---
Change your voice chat to team and start sending out invites to other solo players. You’ll have a companion in no time.
---
I do this when the rest of my squad is away so team perks and mutations stay active.
---
I think Well Fed and Well Hydrated are represented as each being their own kind of thing in order for them to have separate status icons in the lower right of your screen.
---
the game itself? a memorable shitstorm, a joke of a game, and a hurtful sign of downfall on a beloved company.
---
Came across the ying and yang bots on the road in the mire. They were debating something and I naded them to see if they took damage. They do. They died that day.
---
Not a single enemy. No. I get the random pack of ghouls or mole rat attacks from down the road but I don't have any spawn in.
---
There's a super mutant camp down from mine, far enough they don't bother me ever but close enough for me to enjoy taking pot shots haha
---
Off on a tangent for a sec but one thing I know absolutely nothing about mutations. Can you elaborate a bit on that?
---
This game really needs a plot!
---
You'll have much better luck finding the plans at treetops FYI. 
---
That's exactly NOT what a DMCA is for.
---
What ever happened to being able to fight with words?
---
Last couple of weeks I've stopped by the vault multiple times as people were leaving and dropped them 20 diluted stimpacks, and then some spare clothing and helmets, as well as a couple hundred .38 rounds, and even gave them some tips for starting out. I wish I had known even a fraction of the stuff I do now when I started, and it feels good helping noobs start out a bit easier.
---
[r/thatHappened](https://www.reddit.com/r/thatHappened/) 
---
I experienced this as well and it was somehow related to the very large number of holotapes I was carrying at the time. If you happen to have a large number of tapes, try stowing a bunch of them in your stash and then try to use the master holotape. I do not recommended dropping them on the ground, since dropping a large number of single items can crash your game.
---
I'm yet to see a player in that :(
---
These perks are so damn useful because of this. Makes the whole ballistic fiber thing tolerable. Just night and day really. 
---
Same with switching perspectives. (First  person to third person or the other way around)
---
It's still wrong and illegal.
---
I fell like I’m doomed to find every lead pipe variant before I find something OP.
---
Hypocrite
---
We need PTD (Push to Dialate) :)
---
Seems to me he was having a little back and forth PvP battle over a workshop.. working as intended
---
Only he gets bonus points, he made you come to Reddit to vent. Love it.
---
Logically, when selling items, it should sell the item you're on, and go to the next item in the list. Most of the time it does, but sometimes it bugs out and jumps a space up or down, causing you to unintentionally sell something. I'm on PS4 if this makes a difference. 
---
It is entirely possible to sell something you don't want to without it being user error. 
---
Ye that'd be cool, sell them as a bundle but have them be separate 
---
That's slightly demoralizing, that's a lot of rounds to put through the gun, I don't think I can spare the perks for the durability, so I might be stuck with the harder hitting but less ammo intense harpoon.
---
Not out of line. All the other fallouts have offered it basically before you leave the vendor. 
---
At level 12 you have barely made a dent in the game.
---
It helps a lot. That ID card has been a huge mystery. I'll head out and explore that area asap. Thank you! 
---
roughly equidistant from Whitesprings, Watoga, and Harpers Ferry. Has a great view of Watoga, too.
---
Huh, I've never seem icons for them right now my Icons consist of the DNA Strand, the steaming saucer and the pill. Unless you mean there full fledged bar? 
---
I did the same exact thing I feel like such a dummy. I've been looking for ragstad for hours and just can't find one!
---
Found three sets of Marine Wetsuit Plans a Harper’s out of the 5x I checked
---
This is a fact
---
Was this on PS4, because I do that with my 2 shot Mini nuke launcher
---
I invested *because* of the bad reviews. I knew it couldn't be as bad as people acted like, and it isn't. It's a perfectly fine (Bethesda) game and I'm enjoying it so far.
---
Defeatist as in expecting a game that advertises PvP functionality to have something of the sort rather than a random, eternal queue disguised as a radio station?  I mean this sub is pretty much 10,000 people doing Bethesda's job for them already, why do I now have to save Hunter/Hunted for them?
---
Ok big man.
---
only if you don't say a word about this game's problem
---
when you do they just go haywire and tell you to shut up
---
Oddly enough, I got one last night as a drop from the queen. 
---
While we’re at it: also jumping will jump out of it
---
I feel like I'd be leveling faster if I was actually doing the missions. I'm mostly just roaming around looking at shit.
---
I've noticed on Xbox workshops have them...
---
It really annoys me how it's held. Like how are you gonna swing that properly with your hands on each end? So weird. 
---
Same thing with the spear. Looks dumb. 
---
I grew up near Kc, actually. xD
---
[All Your Base, Are belong to us ](https://youtu.be/8fvTxv46ano) 
---
the "black market" is how in-game economies come to be. like I said in another post, is this your first online game? either you have a healthy market through illegal means, which is something common, or you don't have a market at all.
---
&gt;Okay I'm bored of circling.
---
so am I. you seem dense on purpose. so I'll get to the bottom line: this game can't have a healthy economy without real currency because A)there are several mechanics that work against it, such as the caps cap and B)it's buggy.
---
don't claim you want a healthy market, a stable economy but demonize irl transactions because that's contradictory and simply impossible. either there's a market backed by actual currency or it's just caps and people duping and crashing the "market" is irrelevant.
---
Imposter!
---
You are no Raider. Real Raiders dont have time for posing for CAMP selfies and using this sub like their IG feed, they are out raiding and wreaking havoc upon the meek
---
Pull your skirt up coward!
---
I wouldn’t say it’s the worst but it isn’t the greatest. However, sometimes you have to settle with what you get whenever it comes to getting perfectly rolled legendary pieces. 
---
Yeah seems about 50/50. He either has that or the ultra light marine torso and some random junk
---
how...? why?
---
Yeah, I'm on Xbox and noticed this as well. He has the same 2 weapon plans for the last 5 days or so. He used to be one of the top 3 camp plan dealers. This is the station vendor and not the brotherhood vendor in Watoga. 
---
I get this sometimes. Prob as soneone suggested because I have the launcher and the games on separate drives.
---
I can confirm that if you press install and ensure you select the drive/path you already installed the game in, that the "installation" is immediate. 
---
I run with Good Doggy and only eat dog food.
---
Not sure if you’re able to make it to watoga, but go out the side door of the vendors shop, turn right and you’ll see some tables. There’s usually about 5 cans of dog food there, it’s part of my daily cycle now.
---
[r/OopsDidntMeanTo](https://www.reddit.com/r/OopsDidntMeanTo/) 
---
I said I know people who do.  I don't participate.  Prefer to earn what I get.
---
I’m sure it’s probably just a matter of getting an actual stock instead of pistol grip
---
please tell me how. I'm curious.
---
I just want to put my Fusion Core inside Flauresca.. is that too much to ask??
---
As far as what to do or what?
---
What a special boy
---
Putting a stock on it will make it a rifle.
---
Laughed out loud
---
Hey that sounds like my base..
---
I use a Gauss while it’s in the air and either a handmade or shotgun when it lands.
---
When you hit somebody in vats it automatcally locks on another target after you kill the first target.  At higher ranks you start getting bonuses to damage to the 2nd, 3rd, etc targets.  With melee it works best when they are grouped together, but can also be handy in locking on to a target out of melee range that you may not have seen.
---
So make your own video
---
Use their click baity titles and show how it's fake.
---
Instead of belly aching, do SOMETHING.
---
Ive tried scrapping hundreds of of laser rifles/sniper rifle but still can the find the stock
---
Clarksburg in Toxic Valley
---
Do you think someone would do that? Go on the internet and lie?
---
This 👏 is 👏 what 👏 you 👏 signed 👏 up 👏 for
---
The answer you’re looking for is power armor
---
Oh so if the camp is on a non-reachable place for pets (like the peak of Seneca Rocks lol). The pet won’t spawn in the camp and instead get trap at the bottom of the mountain? =o
---
My camp is the one at the other end of the road. It has a working radio in the house, but spawns supermutants.
---
oh, this is what you mean by hypocrite?
---
I was simply making use of the tools given to me. I don't need to agree with something to profit from it.
---
call me an opportunist or whatever, not a hypocrite. I find it fucking ludicrous but I'm not gonna stop myself from using it.
---
Sounds like you had great luck then. Treetops has it frequently as well. 
---
90% are your posts are in the FO76Bazaar 
---
The posts where your selling you want caps. 
---
The posts where you buying you don't mention your willing to fork over real life currency. 
---
Your just as invested in the "man child" market as any of us. 
---
You talk that real life money is the only way a market can exist but you don't partake in it. 
---
With that I bid you goodbye. 
---
Just like your view on caps, your argument holds no value if you can't stand by what your saying. 
---
Haha
---
There is a player called Lucky777 who destroys my camp every chance he can get. I didn’t do anything to this guy. 
---
That's inappropriate... But sexy.
---
And downvoted to oblivion. Apparently the deaf join YouTubers as enemies of the game
---
Depends on your endgame motivation
---
If still low leveled, you dont even need a CAMP resource. Progressing through the missions and exploring the map will get you ample of whatever you need.
---
Endgame, whatever you are focusing on at any particular time is what the best resource is. For example, I started needing acid, then lead, then crystal, now Im on a steel one. 
---
I don't think exist bro
---
Yeah. I know it's the guys in the suits who make all the dumb marketing. The art team isn't to blame and when it comes to art style, 50s isn't my thing haha, ever since Fallout 3 I've struggled having hair styles and clothes in game I liked lol. The style of it is personally taste, I find it ugly, irl I have very 'scene/emo/rock' hair type of oh deal, long fringe etc, that isn't in this games universe, that's more 80-90s onward but the pricing ima moan about haha
---
Someone should hit Solomon's Pond to see how beefcake the Behemoth there gets. 
---
endgame is blocking those douchebags so that they end up sad and alone forever.
---
3 Star Legendary dropped drill. Scorched Queen dropped a drill. Like really Bethesda.
---
Hypocrite 
---
and I don't bring up cash because it gets you banned. this is Leddit, after all.
---
Yeah with duping so prevalent that’s a common TSE, if you wanna see rare look at bloodied explosive Gatling. Roughly 350-500 damage per shot at &lt;20% hp
---
I didn't have too much trouble staying alive at Queen in my early 40s in level 25 excavator armor.
---
So as previous poster said, the answer you're looking for is power armor.
---
You’re wrong about a lot of things. You won’t become wanted for looting anything in this game. The only time you would is when you try to lockpick someone’s extractor in order to take whatever it was extracting. 
---
Even if you went to somebody’s workshop and they had an extractor there without a lock, you can loot it and not become wanted. It’s basically free materials if the owner doesn’t lock it.
---
I enjoyed the game when I was playing it, but nothing about the games market or currency made me think there would be a real world market for it. Very surprised anyone is buying caps for money.
---
Also holstering/unholstering your weapon
---
Nope, that's the buff for any food-based consumable. Though the bars could be another possibility as to the minor quirk of mine I'm probably alone with. 
---
sadly you have to scrap another ultracite laser pistol cause regular laser  weapons are different then ultracite
---
Lmao, "after the bugs are squached"
---
Honey, this game inherited bugs from fucking Morrowind. Bethesda has zero interest in bugfixing and 100% interest in strip-mining your wallet
---
hmm, wonder if you can nuke the far west area, like west of the tea pot. Huge amount of plants growing there.
---
OK
---
Oof
---
 Even worse, I bought a "resort sign" for over 900 caps almost a month ago, and have yet to figure out what or where it is. It's not the "whitespring resort" sign either, that's part of a set. 
---
I've never heard the phrase 'pull your skirt up' hahah.
---
I'm sorry I'll go blow up some camps and steal *runs off*
---
If only Bethesda would send one to me
---
At Seneca rocks..
---
It takes awhile for them to get there but they're not at the bottom of the mountain they're glitched into the mountain. You can hear them under your feet. When I fast travel and glitch into the mountain I sometimes land on the plane my animals are but don't see them
---
Does it work like a hazmat suit?  If not I'm glad you saved me some atoms - was about to buy it
---
If you play as a team I highly recommend strange in numbers (perk) and herd mentality (mutation). The boost to stats, speed and jump height are insane when stacked with what you already have.
---
You lose your levels in caps no matter what.  Big risk and reward.  We like hunting high level whales.
---
Haha that'll be the camp I pot shot the muttys in 
---
Low level characters throw off the difficulty in queen zones, and make them harder for people actually doing damage. It's pretty inconsiderate to show up to the queen fight with no intention/ability to help. 
---
Yeah Im pretty sure I heard it in a rap song back in my rebellious days.
---
Lol
---
After farming Whitesprings, I leave all my unwanted stuff in the cash registers in the workshop area. 
---
3 star rolling pin. 
---
Hahah super mutant hunting! The perfect sport for raiders &gt;D 👍
---
get yourself a dictionary or something. I'm an opportunist, I have no standards. that doesn't make me a hypocrite.
---
also look up the definition of p2w while you're at it. fucking hell.
---
......for science, honest
---
Doesn't work as one or as a skin for one. And I'm glad I did too. (bought it cause I like nuka girl/nuka stuff) hopefully they'll add to it. Here's to hoping 
---
I've run into 3 of them in the woods NE of Top of the World by following the train tracks away from the station and up past the observatory.  2 were the red eyed ones and one was purple wise mothman.  Another attacked my campsite in the area as well.  All of them appeared at night.
---
Sexy sexy science.
---
So I did that and sure enough the problem went away. 
---
I even added a link to some tests I tried. Would've uploaded more but haven't been playing a lot the past two days. 
---
A player recently sold it to that vendor, then.
---
I don’t return fire unless I’m hit/shot multiple times, like to the point where it was obviously intentional 
---
Den/den lol
---
I uploaded a link. 
---
Once you're level 34+, get Ammosmith to craft ammo at scale and combine with SuperDuper once you're level 50+.  This is the best solution and if you can source lead, you'll be rolling in ammo.
---
At lower levels, grab the Scrounger perk and search every ammo container for extras.
---
it would be a great way to know if you are gaming with a dev
---
That's why people expect to be paid decently for them, you think sanskrit is hard, buddy, you need two languages for a web page (html for the 'content' and css for the format)
---
Its the single "whitespring" sign
---
You really should just stick to the meme reddits, since just like the memes most people dont really care you exist.
---
I have a few - Speed demon, marsupial, herd mentality and the healing one. I can jump on most roofs, my running speed and heal times are insane.
---
You can get random muatations from taking a lot of rads or buy them at the bunker (expensive).
---
When you have one you want to keep, use the starched genes perk and it’ll stay.
---
If you want to get rid of one, just take a radaway without starched genes equipped.
---
TP is surprisingly resilient to nuclear bombs.
---
I ran across a suitcase full of plans at a train station yesterday, which was a wonderful surprise!  I left the ones I didn't use plus my own duplicates for the next lucky soul.
---
It's not a bad area actually. Two close vendors (even if they are both same faction). across the highway is water and a junk deposit. It's a little high traffic for me but it's a good central location for fast travel as well.
---
Totally agree.  The only time I dont like night eyes in the dark is in burning mines.  Not enough light to light the darkness but enough to give serious feedback to NE.
---
Yeah but I would like to know your resistance values.
---
Not really. I can think something is fucking stupid, or evil, or petty and not "take it seriously". 
---
I never said it wasn't. I'm just saying. Library_IT_guy said "imagine" but we don't have to because some asshole company actually did it.
---
7 days worth of the BS that Bethesda's marketing department produces?
---
Thanks good sir
---
Pc?
---
Same here. Literally every single time I've visited him since hitting level 45.
---
I also see it very often at Harper's Ferry and sometimes at Pheonix too.
---
Meanwhile, I pretty much only have plans for a couple basic guns. Still looking for a ton of plans, most of which they are supposed to carry, only one of which I've seen (.50 Cal at Pheonix, didn't have the cash at the time).
---
This system is doodoo.
---
I uploaded a link. With proof. Sorry for the bad camera in the bottom one. Editing on mobile is a bitch. 
---
Carry weight bonus and the strength bonus is pretty alright.
---
I just want it to be a lighter version of power armor but it still gives similar buffs and almost as good as protection the full frame stuff would have.
---
I could flesh out my idea more but I don't really know how to properly balance it.
---
Hmmmmm if you say so
---
I hear the same 8 songs over and over, with the rare Country Roads appearance every ~2 hours.  It's all over but the crying.
---
Having a non mutant in the group always used to do it to me, I ended up getting rid of bird bones. 
---
More like a bugthesda hydra. Cut off one bug two more grow in its place 😂
---
Mutant's Rolling Pin.  Apparently Wolverine was making pie crusts in the wasteland recently.
---
You can’t really change the resistances for power armor. Tbh any full set will get you through a queen battle, or even a hazmat if you’re with a lot of people. Just have a good weapon that can do some damage
---
Good bot
---
That's legit, good to know there's not that one rare resource that everyone is going to try and kill me over.
---
Hahaha I won't say it wasn't fair we both used Stims. I just ran out. However, the second time my back was towards them and I was running away. I said "what can I, a level 72 player do to a level 21 player? Oh shit. Drop a nuke. 
---
You caught her in the middle of her kitchen remodeling.  Somebodys gotta make the sammaches for the king.  XD
---
On the ghouls alot of table top systems have them consume radiation over time like food/water and if they run out they start taking penalties as their body canabalizes the radiation keeping their brains going, perhaps radiation could be both food and water for ghouls in that same aspect
---
With Super Mutants, I'd say they should be able to wear power armor parts like normal armor, but have to apply mods to all other armors to wear them (blocking the use of deep pocketed, or higher defense options, or making the higher defense options much more expensive).  Maybe also make them have to do a special 'trigger mod' on guns they use to be able to fit their sausagy fingers into them trigger guards
---
Lead and junk extractors are probably the best to have in your camp.
---
At lower levels though I found I got much more use out of keeping my camp mobile so I could use it to fast travel
---
Ah...that sucks. I was thinking of moving to the mountain peak, but if my pet can’t spawn up in the camp then I now have to choose between scenic view or having a pet =/ anyway, thank you for the answer!
---
Your PS4 game sends out the same data as a PC or Xbox game. Use whatever size Surface tablet you want while playing on your PS4 and the linked file will work. 
---
aww that sucks man im sorry, I would just hit white springs for now its hit or miss with the queen ive read. Its ok to complain sometimes. 
---
 "Thanks Bethesda for making me the girl of the house."
---
You don't have to be a girl to scream in fear fam. Don't imply being fearful=girl... 
---
Thanks for the opinions. I think I already knew I wanted to pull the trigger on it but I appreciate the comments.
---
Ps4 
---
The radio is a hot mess except for the 0.01% of the time when Country Roads starts playing at just the right moment and life finally makes sense.  I've had it start playing just as I was running up a hill towards 2 deathclaws that, I kid you not, turned and ran from me, and then again later when I was in the Enclave bunker and saw an X01 jetpack mod.  Each of those moments offset a good 10 application crashes for me.
---
Pretty sure I picked up the original plans at a Raider Vendorbot. I would tag all of them in my searches. 
---
I can try getting it, once i get some aluminum I will have enough mats to make and scrap a dozen or so of them, pray to the RNG then
---
From their support page 
---
CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE
---
Provide the following:
---
Order Number. It should start with BTH
---
Email address you used at time of purchase
---
Brief  description of your issue. 
---
In an email to customerservice@gear.bethesda.net and we'll review your request and get back to you  
---
That tells me you wait to hear back from them before proceeding to return your product. Since they never responded other than the system generated email, I chanced it mailing back the item. 
---
Usually, you have a return slip or at least RMA number to put in or on the packaging. 
---
Shucks 
---
I'm still wanting to test out my ghoul slayers crossbow - just haven't gotten around to it yet.
---
Like someone to guide me in game type thing
---
Still doing this?
---
I use fountains
---
Well uhhh.... 
---
I think that would make it easier for other people to get off easily bc they could pay others off and never be punished for doing anything wrong. 
---
However, I believe you only get a bounty by killing somebody who never initiated PvP w you, not by just shooting them (and a few other ways of course.) Only shooting them would be just initiating PvP. 
---
But I also think a Karma System would be a cool concept to enter the game. Like you said, to see who good and bad people are. But at the same time now that I'm thinking about it, it's not how it is IRL. You wouldn't know who was good or bad until you met them. 
---
To get through the launch sites or what to do in nuke zones?
---
The fact that there's no dj doesn't make it any better

Made a post on this yesterday, try getting there health to refill once you get them halfway. Not going to resay the entire thing but if you are one hitting them or not giving them time to refill by hitting them over and over it can cause them to not drop proper loot. Hope this help. 
---
You're using the wrong flair man. 
---
I ran into a guy whose parrot was fighting his dog in the background.
---
There were quite a few people that wanted previews of camp items, so they added those to the camp build menu to see how they look. So it could happen with hair, etc too.
---
Although, once added to the camp menu, there was then a post here saying *"Bethesda are now pushing paid items in our face! Shameful!"* or something to that affect.
---
That makes me a sad panda.  Was really wanting to get it, but not without it having some kind of protection since it cant be worn over armor. :(
---
There is a perk in luck that gives your weapon a chance to repair itself when used to strike an enemy , good for gun bash escapes and Melee builds. 
---
Since this could be a good thread for gunsmith questions , does anyone know if it effects shotgun wear and tear ? I have found so far my shotguns degrade far too quickly even with ranks in gunsmith
---
Ah dont worry about that, if your CAMP is placed there, its yours. You cant be killed for it. You may log in one day though, and have a "Your camp cannot be placed" message, this means someone else has their camp on or around the same area as yours.. so you can either replace or leave the game and rejoin a new server
---
I fe3l you fam
---
No, my friend got a plan called "metal signs" I think. That whole row unlocked for him. That sign is still locked for me. And if that little ass sign IS what I payed 900 plus caps for..... Well, that's a whole other topic. 
---
Hah, having a gf... Real men have Dogmeat and only Dogmeat, the good boye of video games
---
By this point, I assume that only cheats have TSEs.
---
I’ve only found Phoenix where is the other vendor?
---
FNV had better mods, like having one button to cycle through throwables and another to throw the selected, and another pair for a droppable, plus displaying the icon of the current throwable and droppable on the HUD. The design made it very fast to switch between using a stick or two of dynamite for trash mobs, or setting sewers on fire with a frag, and laying bottlecap mines for a deathclaw. 
---
I love crossbows
---
But they'd be a robot. In. A. Suit. 
---
I've gained more karma with shitposts than your verbal diarrhea has ever or will ever earn you
---
Hubs would be great!
---
Where players put junk items into it, similar to a stash, that they passively earn caps from as people buy from the Hub. It could be world specific (more capacity, like 600 or so) or available to everyone (less capacity, somewhere between 50-100 initially).
---
Keep adding, let's design this for them. Like most developers, ideas come from their player base.
---
Through the silos.
---
Fair point.
---
I have that issue my build makes my shotgun do 1k but it does 717
---
Pacifist.
---
It can be wore over armour. I can wear it over all my heavy Raider armour. Don't worry about that part
---
What platform do you play on?
---
No probs.
---
Word of note: when you "select" the frame instead of "drop" it, it pops out and you can "drag" the frame around similar to when you are placing items in camp build mode. Helps a lot if you need to put the frame in a specific spot like a repair station.
---
Depending on your sense of humour you can do what I do.. I like to giggle to myself while running rings around whoever is shooting me while using the "HELP ME" emote that does the funny waving arms animation. Yeah im a manchild and it amuses me, but if the other person is normal, they usually laugh and join in
---
Level 23 second shifter here as well. I knock out a few hours here and there when I can, usually at night after work. I am really enjoying taking my time. I've done the Responder and Order of Mysteries questlines, but haven't finished them. I do a lot of exploring as well. Favorite weapon so far is the Somerset Special. So far I've just done solo play, but may try to interact with folks at some point, other than the random helping out if someone is nearby and needs it. Other than the server disconnects, I have no complaints about the game.
---
I got super lucky and found a central location super close to watoga and whitespeing with both lead and acid. Ammo is flowing out of my ass currently

Okay I did:
---
Definition of hypocrite. 1 : a person who puts on a false appearance of virtue or religion. 2 : a person who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings.
---
Meaning 2: You argued that the only market must include real world currency's however when involving yourself in sales on the market, you did NOT ask or pay with real world money. 
---
You acted in contradiction to your stated belief. 
---
Now P2W
---
Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.
---
The game has a function that allows you to purchase a better item faster than those not paying. 
---
Those not paying have to wait for rng to bless them could happen sooner or later. A 2SE is a definite advantage over other players and the pve side itself. 
---
Now Opportunist
---
someone who immediately takes advantage of a situation to reap some personal benefits
---
I would hardly say using a feature of the game. Trading items for caps is grasping an opportunity. Trading along the normal standards would not make you an opportunist. It would make you a player of the game. Selling bulked junk to a store doesn't make me an opportunist. 
---
Also an opportunist is immediately taking advantage. Like buying a 2SE on the fly in game for 100 caps not putting up a post waiting for someone to respond. 
---
&gt;f you’re with a lot of people. Just have a good weapon that can do some damage
---
Any recommendations?
---
Aw sorry :(
---
The most useless ever, was actually from Fallout 4: The Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Gun. 
---
They could have just been douchebags and weren’t trying to claim the workshop 
---
Furious Death Tambo aficionado reporting!
---
This. Yep. I've randomly gotten them from drops in whitesprings. 
---
*drops mic*
---
Legendary and melee weapon balance is a big problem ... Bethesda needs to do something or this game will suffer a quick death.
---
I think it's because you can't actually opt-out of PVP. And since people can't do full damage if you don't retaliate, assholes have just taken to wrecking camps.
---
You're welcome! I love the reactions.
---
That wouldn't be shuffle then, that would be a loop
---
10/10 Reddit name 😂
---
Thx
---
You should tell him you're already tracer. From what I gather from my 13 year old thats a thing kids say these days and he will laugh.
---
I got a junkies ripper 1* want it?
---
Ghoul slayers gamma gun
---
I learned this the hard way as well. Didn’t leave the vault before trying to team up with a pal who already had the game. When the ‘team up’ feature was still glitchy you would have to quit to main menu to join from social friends list. After making my first person but before leaving the vault I did just that. What a let down that was clicking play just to be greeted by the character design screen once more. 
---
Just east outside of Harper’s Ferry there are two bridges. On bridges has a couple of base foots in the water to build on.
---
I’ve had this happen and I don’t bother making ammo unless I can have AT LEAST 100 steel left over
---
Yeah but I mean like a shuffle loop. It would play all the songs in one order, then change the order in the next loop, but still have to play through all the songs again before the third loop.
---
The worst that would happen is at the end of one loop and the beginning of another you might have some songs play pretty close together, but you wouldn't have one song play three or four times in a 30 minute span.
---
Depends on the build. Most people do explosive/two shot heavy weapons or rifles. Then when sh drops most people go 2h melee. But it is mostly about having a bunch of people. Before you launch ask for some help here and tons of people will come help kill the queen.
---
Oooh, misread the original comment about removing the underarmor.  Might get it now... Guess I'll be playing a girl again XD
---
Haha this is my favorite response yet :)
---
If Bethesda thought it was a serious problem. They would fix it immediately. The issue with the silos was fixed in ONE DAY.  So that should speak volumes. 
---
Ideally I think it would be easy. Find players who have stockpiled massive amounts of the same legendary weapon and remove all but one. Then fix the bug. 
---
Or
---
Fix the bug, Accelerate all the 3 stars break frequency,  add an additional necessary component to repair that’s REALLY hard to find. Then make legendarys  drop new 4 star stuff more frequently for a while. Then everyone will forget about their 3 star duped shit. 
---
First and foremost, Bethesda has more to do with this game's rep than anyone.  
---
Second, shit youtubers are obvious when they are being shit, and this guy is a total ass clown.  Ass clowns should be dismissed, they don't speak for everyone.  There are a few very good youtubers who genuinely have fanboy type love for this IP, give honest informed opinions and have been very fair.  They are pretty easy to find.  
---
any TSE weapon, handmade rifle, gauss rifle, super sledge. 
---
All with their related builds of course.
---
If I hear “Ol’ Man Mose” or “I Didn’t Know The Gun Was Loaded” one more time, I’ll explode. The rate at which those two play feels much higher than the rest 
---
If you look up the site Nuka Crypt, they post and decipher each weeks codes. 
---
*bows low*
---
Ballistic bowels
---
How would those penalties be justified without making super mutants crazy OP in other regards?
---
Also none of the weapons the supermutants drop have modified triggers.
---
My issues is I am a sniper build, and my buddy is melee. It works well gameplay wise, but not exp wise. If I sit back and kill things he loses out. If he agros everything I lose out. 
---
Yup. Really annoying when trying to farm xp.
---
I wonder if for the enclave of these future additions will let us access into those big rooms (something around the lines of the West Virginia rooms and the governor room) that are inside the Whitespring hotel 
---
At the train station, south of the main part of town
---
I was running around the Kanawha Nuka-Cola Plant. Found a guy level 28 in a hodgepodge of PA I’m level 30. Took him to my base and gave him the pieces he was missing. We then joined a nuke zone and killed the queen that spawned with some higher levels. Then they turned on us. I body blocked for as long as I could so he could get away with his loot.
---
I know some people do unarmed but I’ve gotten every shitty unarmed weapon as a 3star. Worst are the knuckles and knives...
---
Exactly. No one wants to spend time on the ticket because a) it's going to suck to deal with and a fix isn't even guaranteed, and b) it will screw up their stats.
---
Hello There
---
This sounds like me a while back. I finally managed to stop when I hit 97 but lately I've found it creeping up and I'm at 14 fusion cores. Don't ask me how many plasma cores and ultracite cores I have and I won't tell you lies.
---
Just cram more songs in there. Bingo Bango bongo. 
---
I'll check this later, because I've unlocked metal signs, but I'm not sure I had this unlocked. What platform are you on
---
What console?
---
I feel like I've seen your base posted before. And I like it.
---
Take out their turrets.. 1-2 bullets to each takes them out. Gives you a minimal bounty. You effectively neutralize their base without destroying it
---
Dont be afraid of the bounty, EMBRACE it
---
This got me a bounty at level 3 in the beta. I was on the run the whole session
---
You absolute madlad
---
First you choose which stat special you’d like to increase than you can choose which card from any special stat. 
---
I've had several instances of killing myself and one where I thought i should have died. Those when I have killed myself I watched the damn thing go half (HALF!!!) the distance it's supposed to go and explode right back in my face almost instantaneously, with very little in the time it took the nukes to fall. 
---
It's still fun tho. I love being the demo man with heavy gun support. 
---
PWN the base.
---
Platform? I need to know because if it's Xbox I know what area to avoid.
---
Amusingly, when I come to this sub now I get sidebar ads for Runescape, an mmo I have never played but that apparently has something in common with F76 besides similar graphics quality.
---
To clarify you keep your armor pieces and such, but the actual "underarmor" item is removed. Items such as the t shirt and pants, raider leathers, etc. are removed. 
---
Anything on a wooden piece of armor
---
Want to be useful and effective at minimum a 50 cal at best a 3 star 50 cal two shot with faster  fire rate.   
---
I take 6-8 to every queen fight just incase I get the damn useless under level 40 people and I have to carry the kill. 
---
I have thought a lot about this whole ordeal and I think I understand why things are so bad.  When you look at the value of an item in the Atomic shop with the retail cost of Atoms ... 100 = $1, things are ridiculously overpriced.
---
Bethesda is pricing things based on two currency "input" methods: quests/dailies/weekly and also the ability for people to purchase Atoms for cash.  This is a huge flaw.
---
The solution is to just make all items in the store either cost Atoms (earned only in-game through player actions) or just paying straight-up cash for them.
---
For example: the hairstyle you listed is 800 Atoms or $2 ... that seems a lot more reasonable to me.
---
Not sure if its the same thing your asking about but in enclave bunker there military wing has plans of that type but you have to learn each plan before it give you the shielded version.
---
   I bought 3 plans and learned to the shielded it will put you out about 1300 caps or so to learn them all. 
---
     Hard bargain lvl 3 and shielded hit me for 950 alone. 
---
Is that what is going on. My sledge usually does around 270 but today it was 180??
---
How do I join?
---
We say it isnt bad until you get raped for 3 scorchbeasts at the same time and then keep trying to go back for your junk when the server crashes and you lose everything....thats happened 7 times now...I'd give it around 4 more months for them to get their shit together. Most people still cant get through a nuke session withour crashing.
---
lolwut
---
I’ll be there again
---

---
The game has crashed in the middle of clearing nuke site Alpha 4 attempts in a row. Then I lose my ammo and restart outside of the base. This is very frustrating.
---
That could be caused by either dupers or nuke strikes, do you know if that happened at all?
---
How have I missed that
---
Na its a visual bug only, to do with the last time you discharged your weapon or something
---
You are not losing ammo trust me
---
People always say they crash a lot. I can play for hours without crashing 
---
As mentioned already white springs easiest way it seemed for me got all mine farming that place. 
---
 Kill server hope kill 
---
Well if you ever want to compare power armours or just enjoy some finely crafted chems just hit me up.

IGN: Molly_Apocalipstick
---
Id think so. Theres also an entire 4th floor and the ”presidential" room in the bunker
---
Yeah I downloaded the launcher on pc to check, and all 3 are on there
---
I can’t play today because I’m stuck on a ferry in the Irish Sea. But we have a loose group of about 8 people you’re welcome to join when I’m back. 
---
Can you do text chat on discord?
---
Maybe like they want to discourage farming or something... 
---
Not me because I know I'd never use it just like I never used the fo4 one other than the one time I opened it when it was released.
---
That would be great. Also Fallout76 being compatible with Fallout76 would be great.
---
Lol autocorrect got a love it 
---
Give us a Beacon from Fallout 4, power up, pull the lever Kronk, POP! everyone sees your camp. 
---
You’re over looking the easily abusable aspect of this. Consider a duper has duped roughly 20.000 Nuka Colas. Now this player has beat max caps to destroy bases, kill low level players and be a dick with no reprisal at all with the “pay off system” you’re talking about
---
I'd just like to say bravo for bringing a little order to this wild lands. I hope everyone's lawns are at regulation lengths and their trashcans are parked on the right side of the house.
---
Ooo yes the “presidential” room, I think I remember watching a video of a guy who glitched himself into it, was pretty neat
---
Someone at Bethesda really loves the Pied Piper tale. That's the second Pied Piper Easter egg that I know of in a bethesda game.
---
Don’t worry about it. I’ll stick to whitesprings for now though for sure, I just never did the sbq before and wanted to see how it was
---
Right. It's also possible tech support and customer service are perpetually transferring it. Anyone who has worked tickets knows the old support-service handoff. Tech support says it's not a tech issue l but a service issue. Service says "we can't troubleshoot electronics issues" and shoves it back to TS. This kind of thing happens when management has not set clear policy on how to handle these issues, which also suggests that, unofficially, they don't give a shit.
---
Either way, it's the company leadership and management's fault.
---
You can actually attack any player's base who is flagged for PvP with you. The most extreme of this is to start a claim on someone's workshop, abandon the workshop and fast travel to their camp, and go nuts on it.
---
Yeah, I figured you'd just flag certain items for sale and it greys them out when you look in your stash or displays a little money icon to show that you listed it at your vendor
---
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
---
That's weird.
---
After I unequipped it I still had my Resilient Harness on, while the outfit is on I no you can't see underarmour while it's equiped as a visual. Hmm I didn't think it unequipped under armour. Guess the more you know haha
---
Providing tech support for a 73 year old. You deserve a medal! Tell'em thanks for his service!
---
What platform you on? I might have an extra Chameleon armor piece to give if you're on PS4.
---
PC.
---
Client is unplayable garbage. Freezes constantly. Sometimes for 5 seconds, sometimes for 3+ minutes until I give up and use taskkill. Start up game again, log back in, game freezes WHILE THE SCREEN IS FADING IN. Or sometimes I can play for 15 minutes without a freeze. If I'm lucky half an hour. More likely ten minutes.
---
Threadripper 2920X, 32 GB RAM, GTX 1080, Samsung 970 NVMe M.2 system and game drives.
---
It's not my system.
---
anything that turns me invisible AFTER I get hit
---
The Starlet Sniper is actually a fan made comic book front that was redrawn by the art team for 76 and used in the Atom Shop. Wonder if the person got any comp. for them taking the art, albeit redrawing it completely.
---
Just like they made you sound like a tool.
---
What's the problem with farming though? It's not an exploit. It's part of the grind. And it's shitty of other players to screw over everybody else. 
---
Blackwater mine tons of low level mole miners
---
acid and water if you often claim workshops or do the gathering events in the ash heap
---
lead and water if you are running an auto/high fire rate weapon
---
junk and water if you're running a power armour/resource heavy build
---
Aye!
---
You should go up to people and be like, hey man if you have a mic turn it on, lets be friends! Lots of people dont have their mics on and need to be coaxed out.
---
That is from Fallout 4.  Shotguns have their own line now.
---
Nuke it, then kick of the Mama Dolce and Steelheart events to guarantee spawn enemies
---
Wow they did not patch this for PC just got stuck in armor for like an hour...
---
That too. Would it fall under booze crafting or food crafting..? Hmmm...
---
None. It's a waste of arm durability for no benefit (or at least none that you'll use).
---
Oh I had stuck around a lil bit kinda kicking the dirt with my hands in my pocket 
---
Don't EVER DROP armor.  Deploy it by using the activate key.
---
I'd be ok with that problem ;)
---
I've added random people to inherit my work benches before I log off and met some nice squeakers that thanked me for the stuff and only had 2 that were basically wanting all my gear even after getting a few fully operational workbenches.
---
The nuka grenades are great but the nuka quantum grenades seem to be complete ass. I made 5 of them and while they do a lot of damage, it almost seems like their blast radius is extremely small or something (possibly bugged?). 
---
They do look pretty cool when they explode though.
---
Yeah I cant figure it out 
---
I'm a little late to the party...
---
I'm on PC, and have evidence that this problem exists, at least with the BOS combat chest mod.
---
Adding the mod to my one star legendary gives the item a second star for rad resist, but it doesn't apply to the items resistance or my character's total rad resist. 
---

This would be absolutely amazing!  It would also give me a reason to make multiple characters.
---
For the Ghoul, you should be able to look like a normal Ghoul or a Glowing Ghoul.  It is a matter of preference really.  The positives and negatives are also pretty self-explanatory, like radiation heals you but you are despised by Smoothskins, for example.
---
For the Super Mutant, there would also have to be a way to craft or find Super Mutant armor.  Obvious positives would be superior strength and endurance but at the cost of charisma and agility.  Maybe some other stuff too because they are immune to diseases too.
---
I would also like to see a Scorched option too.  I know that we perfect a vaccine but what if that only affects the Hive Mind mental aspect rather than the physical appearance?  I think they look cool and would love to look like one.
---
I seriously hope BGS adds this stuff in.  Playing as an ordinary human gets boring and maybe we want to role play as a Ghoul or Super Mutant or even a Scorched victim?
---
Update: Got a precise stock on my last one, not certain that is rifle but sounds like it. Trouble is I have no more ultracite to check and build a new one, once i farm some i'll get back to you
---
Oh
---
*leave world*
---
*join world*
---
Or just cut right to the chase and give us a "don't shoot!"
---
I miss 50% of the time when I have a 95% hit chance???
---
Also please explain your build, because shotguns are life
---
You can so get a bounty by accidentally shooting a wall or turret when you're trying to defend someone's workshop. Ask me how I know. 😡
---
I don't know what's up with that destroy warning, but normally you deploy a power armor chassis by selecting it in the pipboy, not dropping it. There is a distinction. When deploying it, you can choose to position and retain ownership.
---
Jesus, Dick!
---
Killed my first yesterday during the Fort Defiance event. Got some loot.
---
Killed second. Zero loot. maybe I didn't hit it? Sure dumped a lot of ammo at it though.
---
Killed third. Corpse disappears completely right before I get to it.
---
Whoever set up the Whitesprings Golf Club didn't get the memo.
---
I freeze. It's not crashing but it's close. I can play for hours if I avoid two big parts of the map around Charleston and Grafton. I'd like to be able to revisit Riverside Mansion or the responder traveling vendor. This didn't happen until the last official fix and now it freezes every time I'm close to these huge areas. 
---
That's 6-8 Guns per fight? Sounds like hybrid ain't gonna happen for me then. 
---
When our camp is under attack can we please get more of a notification? It’s possible I missed it but I noticed my camp was under attack only by looking at my long list of active missions. By the time I fast traveled there it was too late. Some D-bag destroyed nearly everything. Bastard even came back after I repaired everything and started destroying things all over again. I had to leave the session to stop it as I am not playing PVP. 
---
Which brings up another point. While playing in Passive mode can we please have our camps either become VERY difficult to destroy or make them invincible? I put a lot of effort into my camp and it’s really shitty that someone can come along and destroy all of my hard work while I’m out trying to have fun with the game.
---
Well crap, my unyielding build might be garbage now. Never seen this before today. Gonna have to check out my items when I get home and see if it's all affected or if it resets. 
---
Ah, I digured it might be that. I’ll have to try and claim some for some more rewards. The last one gave me a bad taste in my mouth because of piss poor pvp balance when I had to defend it.
---
Well that's not good! I haven't had this happen since the patch, but maybe there's a new bug?
---
That's the best part. There's no way that emotes are cosmetic because the emotes essential translate into communication. If you can communicate more accurately, you will have an easier time in situations where the other person cannot hear your voice. I usually don't talk unless I need to. The only time I do talk is to read notes so party members don't have to or if there is no emote to communicate my message.
---
They should make more emotes and make them free or 50 atoms.
---
On PC or I would make it for you. I got the plan from BOS vendor in Watoga (I believe his name is Vendor Bot Phoenix).
---
TIL Canadians don't know baseball very well
---
I’d suggest making friends with someone that you can run with you through the silo, it’s far easier when you memorize the way through instead of getting lost
---
*kneels to commit seppuku* I have dishonored my overseer. 
---
This starts to happen after you apply a skin purchased through the Atomic Shop.
---
Oh I do. I recently found a two shot missile launcher, also if you nearly break their workbenches but don't completely you can level everything with one swift mini nuke. 
---
Good to know. 
---
Ah thanks!  It happens randomly and I never caught my ammo count before it popped up. 
---
One last thing actually please take note of "Barter" and "Nominal"
---
Barter is Caps for Items. Two virtual commodities. 
---
Nominal: Fallout 76 (name only as we don't own the intellectual property)
---
Market Definition:
---
An actual or nominal place where forces of demand and supply operate, and where buyers and sellers interact (directly or through intermediaries) to trade goods, services, or contracts or instruments, for money or barter.
---
Markets include mechanisms or means for (1) determining price of the traded item, (2) communicating the price information, (3) facilitating deals and transactions, and (4) effecting distribution. The market for a particular item is made up of existing and potential customers who need it and have the ability and willingness to pay for it.
---
A market can include a barter OR real currency. 
---
You asked for definitions and I delivered. 
---
Fuck the Mic *drops nuke!*
---
I live in an apartment building, and last I checked, wearing headphones doesn't make your voice any quieter.
---
This sub is the worst part of FO76
---
Especially when they aren't benefiting from it in any way. They are greifing. It goes even further if you die from it. 
---
Awesome! I can tell you that if I see a lower player in something like a nuke happens, I see if I can help, especially over mic if I'm not in a psn party. If I am in a party I will at least send them a thumbs up so they know I'm a good person and wont shoot them. Sometimes I will randomly trade with someone and just gift them items for no reason other than I know it will help them out! I got picked on when I was a lower level and always promised myself I would do my best to help others. Now being level 106, I still get the occasional strange person that is level 10 that keeps hitting me and trying to kill me. First, I try to just walk away but if they keep following me and keep at it, then I go ahead and end up shooting them back. When that happens, a lot of the time, I end up one shoting them. Honestly I'd much rather help someone than engage in a pvp match. Glad to see there are still good people out there! 
---
Well, it's impossible to loot people's stash. But if they leave something in a shared container (i.e anything other than their stash), then it's fair game and you get no punishment for taking it all. You get a bounty for picking locks, which can apply to extractors, but it's pretty generic - even picking a door or safe in a workshop somebody claimed gives you a bounty
---
Weird. I hope it gets fixed 
---
Level 2-50:
---
Choose a SPECIAL point to level up, then choose a card from one of the SPECIAL categories.
---
Important note: If you choose to cycle between the categories you STILL get the original SPECIAL point you picked, just with a possible card from a different category.
---
ie: Chose to level up LUCK by one point but chose an Agility card.
---
Earn separate card packs at levels 4, 6, 8, 10, and every 5 level after that have 4 random cards and a stick of gum. (ie: 15, 20, 25, ect)
---
Level 50 - on:
---
Choose to move a SPECIAL point -OR- Choose a new card from a SPECIAL category.
---
Earn separate card packs every 5 levels that STILL have 4 random cards and a stick of gum. . (ie: 50, 55, 60, ect)
---
You must not have many friends. 
---
Update: it was the invisible mutation glitch, thank you all for the help!
---
Did you put a paint job on it? I know that dropping anything with paint from the atomic shop will warrant a destroy warning. 
---
Is this still working? I’ve been server hopping like crazy and haven’t been able to get the body to spawn
---
Mine is somewhere near the overseer's C.A.M.P.
---
It's not just ammo. Its if u need scraps that the mod would offer if broken down to scraps. So anything u craft that might need that, and you don't have enough scraps to supply it
---
Pssst.... what’s a tse?
---
I crash a lot. I feel like it is probably dupers.
---
The .exe file is missing for me. I go to the correct file pathing and the game seems like it is just gone
---
I’ve just been walking around each region discovering every area before moving on to the next one, doing the occasional quest here and there 
---
Play through. 
---
No, I know what you want. It's just silly so complain about a vibe of throwing off the shackles of society and then complain that the tattoos available don't reach your visual standards of attractiveness.
---
Not wanting a big ugly tattoo is perfectly valid, as is wanting better tattoo options (in truth, I happen to agree with you, they should offer alternative tattoo locations), but the justification presented is unneeded and slightly ludicrous.
---
Sneaking cancels the fall damage animation outside of power armor fyi
---
Yeah I don't farm caps, I just sell crap I find and it ends up with the same result because there's so much to loot in the game. But I'm just pointing out there are many ways to get them even more easily. You can also dilute stuff like rad-x with chemist and super duper to double-triple your money
---
this is BGS
---
Jail Break for the ranfom gun plans.
---
Uraniun Fever for the 3 legendary spawns.
---
Monster Mash for some good xp farming.
---
Anyone who charges INTO a parking lot when there's gunfire deserves whatever happens to them. Rule One of Fallout games: do not go near any vehicle at any time. It narrowly beats out Rule Two, shoot that fucking Jangles asshole on sight immediately before taking another step.
---
R/market76
---
If you can get yourself any kind of explosive shotgun then it'll get a solid 100 meters.
---
Two shot explosive 
---
Too late ? 
---
The "us?" Line would make more sense if you could play scorched.
---
Search for f076 interactive map. It will display were all deposits are. I jump between 2-3 deposits depending on what i need and how bad
---
You can plant plants at your camp.  As you get more perks and kill more animals and loot more packaged foods, you’ll probably find you don’t need your camp resources as much (except maybe as something to sell).
---
You can make soup out of most vegetables, which makes them feed and hydrate and makes them not give disease.
---
Some areas with food that come to mind, mostly along the western river:
---
* At Tyler County Fairgrounds (the ferris wheel NW of vault), a shack west (?) of the racetrack public workshop has at least 2 corn, 2 tatos, 2 mutfruit.
---
* Way to the north, Aaronholdt Homestead has annoying (but edible) bloatflies and bloodbugs, and a power armor spawn if you can pick the lock, but it also has lots of plants, including cranberries (cranberry pie has 5% xp bonus buff)
---
* Flatwoods has some plants and animals; a responders quest even makes you pick or kill them; it’s a good intro to food and water if you haven’t done it.
---
* Going west of Flatwoods to the shore, I recall encountering Mole Rats.  Mole Rats + Combat Knife = cookable food.
---
* Going west of Flatwoods gets you to the Sunshine Industrial Farm Food Processing Plant workshop; You could capture that workshop to pump out packaged foods.
---
* South of that (so, southwest of Flatwoods) are Silva Homestead which has about 50 corn plants and Billings Homestead which has about 50 razorgrain plants.  The barn between them is a posible power armor spawn point, too.  If you want a grindy but stupidly easy way to get enough caps early on for fast travel, you could pick all these plants until you’re almost overencumbered and sell them all for 1 cap each.
---
I recommend getting the Green Thumb perk under Perception so that you actually get 2 fruit per plant.  It’s good for this and it’s worth having around for the endgame since it doubles the yield of Flux from nuked plants.
---
Oh, so things that one shot everything, cool
---
I'd be willing to believe it. If there was no horrendous PVP slap system, I would expect people to play just for the sake of griefing, but with the only way to grief being to actually play the game for a fair bit of time, I suspect it discourages grief-centric gameplay.
---
Omg epic! Will do 
---
I believe r/fo76bazaar should work
---
Wait I found it! It is in a different drive! how the shit did that happen and just become a problem
---
Basically as soon as you can get any of the water purifiers and generators. 
---
Handy tip: I use the dog food perk (I think it's called good doggy?) and basically never eat anything else unless I want a specific food buff. It makes dog food mostly fill your food bar from empty in two cans and you find dog food everywhere.
---
Seriously. I basically kill who I want when I want, I’m the Enclave goddamnit
---
Near v 76 gorge workshop has 1 concrete spot for a extractor also very easy to take over. 
---
  Also has a black titanium, junk and a wood available as well. 
---
Random drops from Nuked Whitesprings
---
I feel silly saying "beep beep boop" into my mic tho
---
No problem bro. And after you press L1 press triangle to toggle criticals if you have a cull meter it will have a blur effect flash at the edge of the screen
---
I thought it was the other way round. I’ve found shocks when I’ve not been hopping and checked vendors after being on the same server for a few hours.
---
Probably just RNG.
---
If you fast travel to the vault... run towards the overseers camp and then down into flatwoods, you'll come across a cabin with 5 dogs, the overseers cache will give you a food item and a water, then there's 3 more dogs, a rad stag carcass on the side of the road for meat. The hotel you come upon has 3 molerats and 2 radroaches. Across from the church (church has an overseers cache for another food and water item plus there's usually a can of dog food in there and a few boxes of sugar bombs at the top of the church) in flatwoods are 2 possums. Inside the diner across from the church is a locked fridge with about 6 or 7 canned food items. And behind Delberts trailer usually 3 or 4 brahmin and a food cooler. To the left, heading towards the vault tec agricultural center near the tents are two more dead radstag carcasses with meat on them. 
---
The run takes about ten minutes tops and you'll net about 25 food items easily. 
---
I'm on xbox one,got the vault tec skin today and i can confirm it's still bugged :( not game breaking but annoying . I just place it straight everytime until i get bored and go back to a regular version.
---
That's just sad. The Jingle-stomp sound would work perfectly fine for that weapon too.
---
You didn't drink alcohol or anything and it wore off?
---
Perhaps you have perks/mutations (\[when X occurs\], do % more dmg)?
---
If you repair a ripper style weapon with the skill that repairs it over 100% it actually foes 30+ damage 
---
Get that first hard teleporting hit and then just chip chip chip chip chip away at the rest.
---
Charleston isn't bad either. Problem is many nuke whitespring simply because of all the mobs for xp, and people nuke sbq for her drops.. Plus whitespring offers good flux, and prime gives good violet flux
---
You misspelled "wankin'" 
---
You're welcome
---
Not really if it's all RNG that gives you wooden armor or crappy armor pieces in general
---
yeah, my son and I sing along with the radio as we skip thru the Bog
---
I have a cage built here for fights tho
---
I just lost my entire ultracite armor set and three of my two shot hardened handmades it happened right after i dropped all my holotapes
---
I was thinking more about "hey, look, a thousand mobs and someone who one shots everything with melee, let me just get my tag in heeeeere..." nuke zones.
---
That said, having not done an automatic based character, what would you recommend for a weapon when I get higher level?
---
Deep Pocketed if you're anything like me.
---
One violent night is fun if you have friends and I always get 2-3 good legendarys. I even managed to get an explosive 2 shot gauss rifle there.
---
Honestly, I'd like it even better if you didn't have to squat to make it work.
---
You never responded so I got them from someone else.
---
Really? Heh, I find so much of it laying about, had no idea. Explains a lot.
---
Only would happen if you dropped instead of deployed.
---
Just so you guys know...clearing a silo is very easy by yourself. The more people the more enemies. Level 3 lock picking can skip parts of the clear and level 3 hacking can clear enemies for u 
---
Might not be too reliable, but the Leader of the Pack event could work. It spawns three legendary wolves and since the wolves are lower level they would probably have a better chance to drop legendary leather armor
---
The Water Park is good, decent amount of scorched and lots of plants for flux.
---
I have that covered with my siren. Nothing says " come buy my chems " as an annoying af tower of cacophony.
---
So uh, three dog’s dead, so here’s some music
---
Ah okay! Thanks! I didn’t even look
---
Your point is valid, however he is refusing to buy or craft or whatever an auto tesla rifle to tag the enemies. That's all you need is some caps or mats and 10lbs in your inventory to not ruin everyone's chance at a legendary, or even waiting until someone has tagged it first. He's not being a jerk by having all his guns be TSE, he's being a jerk by not going a little out of his way for others to get a chance at good loot
---
Never been there, but I hear all about it!
---
Bish bash bosh
---
60 here too, love it slow, no need to rush!
---
My base is pretty cool and I have 90% of the camp plans. Won’t be on til tomorrow tho! :( 
---
Ahh, see, special needs kids are different from normal kids, saps energy. I dig. Sill think you should look into it, just skip the "make canvas from scratch" aspect and buy it.
---
I'm glad people like you exist. Gives my sneaky breeki bounty hunter something to do 8) 
---
Having a blast myself, play a couple hours after work every evening. Go out and scavenge some resources and explore new areas. Usually run into some trouble. Have done very few quests and already 20. 
---
Don't drop it.  Hit the "use" button or key and it will let you place it.  Then you hit the "use" key again to enter it or the "transfer" key to change power cores or armor pieces.
---
I really doubt they lack the tools to spawn in world items, what they more likely lack is the resources/manpower to use those tools (or the will to assign manpower to using them).
---
From everything we've seen so far of this release, it sounds very likely they have no real method to track in world usage of items. But for them to claim they don't have the power to spawn in-game items is nothing short of bullshit, does this mean their employees spent hours server hopping to try and get plans and mods just to see if they'd work? 
---
the liberators all morph together and create a moving swarm in the shape of liberty prime!
---
I really hope that the vending will be done across all accounts and offline. It should be a machine in game from which we can all access all current offers/trades, similar to how the auction houses work in most MMO's.
---
My only issue with it is the lack of variety. I would like a PA paint job but too many people already have the camo which is the only one in there that I like.
---
I’m lvl 120+ and haven’t spent any atoms yet. It’ll take a lot more variety for me to start dropping cash on anything.
---
Nothing. Same slugger perks, same everything. Fast traveled to white springs and noticed when I hit a ghoul it took like 4 hits instead of the usual 2 maybe. When I went to use some radaway, I noticed the damage on my 3 star sledge had dropped heavily. Checked status/effects and still had 10% damage from glowing steak and a few other +1s, but nothing showed like a damage reduction. That's what I initially thought happened. I'll do more digging whenever I get home. 
---
Check out the fallout board game it lays out the class/race parameters pretty well.  I agree this would be cool for 76 and make multiple characters actually fun and different.
---
It's not $8. It's whatever portion of $8 you'd rather buy than earn (in my case, a big fat %0).
---
Or they could just take the explosive round legendary perk and replace it with something nice like bonus limb damage. Leave the explosive rounds to dedicated explosive weapons and ammo types. It would be much more fair to give up your hardened receiver for explosive 5.56mm. Less damage, more splash.
---
That’s what I’m loving about it, discovering everything on your own, the world is huge. 
---
I’ve got a prime ultracite laser gun receiver 
---
Im usually swimming in stimpacks, somehow I always manage to have 200+ so if I remember and not doing something I'll find a low level player and drop 25 for them, I remember how annoying it was to find healing stuff at a low level so I try to help out a little. Also purified water, I usually have 100+ of that I sell to vendors, or give out
---
I've started Clearing every Car in sight in Whitesprings because of this, I'm a TSE gunslinger who doesn't use pacifist mode and people seem to be okay with me doing it because no one has shot me for it yet.
---
I do not know for sure, but I think that I read that the quest cannot be completed because it will be expanded with dlc
---
I drop extra plans and recipes at the closest train station, in either the cash register, or suitcases for players that may not have them already.
---
Anything legendary knuckles or switchblade.
---
Gonna have to agree with you there, easy mistake especially in a panic to drop instead of deploy. Also to the OP bare in mind you need to differentiate between Bethesda the developers (who undoubtedly have tools to do whatever they need to do) and Bethesda the customer support personnel, who basically have 0 access to anything ingame.
---
Ohhhhhh. Well duh! Oops sorry. :))
---
Is exactly happens me every time it's ridiculous there's a fast travel mat for workshops but not our bases.
---
I'm about to fire the game up in a sec and I'm going to try being a little more trusting. I've ran into two nice people while most just ignore me. All the rest I hide from because I'm just expecting to get fucked with some how. But here goes, I guess.
---
Excellent, that is super helpful. I always wondered why people seemed to swarm Uranium Fever.
---
I have a steel guitar in my inventory and it would be awesome if you could put it on a chair like the banjo at the New River Gorge
---
Stay awhile 'n listen.
---
Yep, I've had a crash while having my chassis deployed, and it was safely in my inventory upon reloading. 
---
Second floor of ToW.
---
So this is your first Fallout game? 
---
Yea, wish there were server ID numbers and ways to join specific servers, might help with the disconnnects.
---
Nice! Good thinking!
---
Also ur solution didn't work still stuck in it...man this game is screwy...
---
I had it on another character, found somewhere between vault and Flatwoods I believe. I deleted the character without realising how rare the item was. [https://imgur.com/iBiTBp2](https://imgur.com/iBiTBp2)
---
Thats funny, I just found that app yesterday, and I was thinking this very same thing.
---
I envy your little farm there. 
---
Pumpin' out that soup and starch like its nobodies business  
---
Whats worse is, range doesn't matter vs Scorchbeasts if they are flying. Shotgun bugs out on them and at times does 0 dmg, and even heals them. Vats Shotgun Crits, which have extreme range, completely miss flying Scorchbeasts no matter how close. It's silly, and it has put a huge dent in my "Shotgun build".  Having to carry around a 20 lbs rifle to take out SBs is very frustrating.
---
Doesn't exist :(
---
I usually run into the newbie areas and drop stuff where I see them going in and out sometimes I stick around and Flash my light ...
---
They’re the ones Giving this game a bad rep? No, claiming that is just ignorant. What gives this game a bad rep is the actual fuckton of bugs, glitches, horrible systems, insanely bad social Interactions system, constant game crashes, the false advertisement and screw-over bethesda did on their collector’s edition buyers, the leaking of all their players’ private and sensitive information, the fuck-over of the nuka Dark rum, i mean do you need a bigger list? The youtubers help keep this game just remotely alive, admitting to duping or not, they’re not the ones giving the game a bad rep... 
---
Battled with you fine people until the beast fell under 10% health before my game crashed. Congrats to all who made it - happy to help again in the future if needed.
---
I got a Two-Shot (but only 1\*, so not Explosive) Laser gun off of a Legendary Assaultron Dominator while clearing a silo last week.
---
I'm like Lv162 now I think and I love watching low levels play haha. Most of the time I just be a guardian angel and sit far back, crouched with binoculars and snip anything or anyone that has a chance to kill the poor newb.
---
Some guy owned a workshop and I was sat in chameleon armour on the watching. He was struggling vs the horde so I just sniped a few who got to close to hurt him
---
All those freaking YouTubers admitting to lying every single one of them duping or using a weight glitch ... Not just that they're spreading the information to others..
---
I wish I had enough stims to give them away... I’ll be well stocked enough to help someday
---
also a "wait" emote for when you are following someone and you get stuck or they get too far ahead
---
Still on?
---
*Loads TS Dragon*
---
"I'll wait..."
---
I do Distant Thunder a lot (well over 100 times) and it's pretty useless.
---
I do AWOL Armaments everytime it's up, someday might get something good.
---
I do Census Violence almost every time I see it, have got a couple decent things but underwhelming.
---
I stopped doing the Enclave stuff after I completed my armor set, as the rewards aren't worth the bullets.
---
One Violent Night seems ok, but I don't like doing it solo and I have no friends.
---
Those are pretty much all I do.
---
There is an exploit (maybe bug) that can make people hit for millions of damage, combined with explosive it would crush every piece of armor in the explosions range.
---
I could be completely wrong.
---
Was crawling around solo on my alt because husband is at work. Ran into some single digit character in over his head. Bailed him out, had a good feeling in my gut about him. Dropped food, medicine, an Assaultron helmet, bullets. Got on his mic, turned out to be a cute kid that couldn’t be a day over 11 or so. Smart, well spoken. Pal’d with him and explained some things. 45 year old woman, but I have the voice of a 12 year old boy. Helps.
---
FO76 Bazzar and FO76 Market are the two trading reddits.  I think one of them has a discord.
---
Putting stalls in the most nuked place in Fallout 76=D
---
I'm asking what a TSE is.  Thx, :D
---
As I said above, people are confusing the customer support people for the devs, Im guessing that the customer support people have no access to anything ingame, where as of course the devs have everything they need to modify and test the game content, as evident by the game files themselves and the hundreds of test cells, and such.
---
Every 20mins is not common
---
where do you find more
---
It helps that Uranium Fever is a hop and skip from Whitesprings and a train station vendor.
---
Maybe check the weapon condition as well. With no perks, the condition goes down rather quickly on saw, a super sledge. There appear to be a few tiers of DMG VS condition as well.
---
same. its happened 6 or 7 times now i'd say. and i've been on both ends of it. other than 1 time, everyone has been cool. that guy who wasn't cool, well he got a tse shotgun to the face and i never saw him again
---
how is a site like playerauctions.com up then ?
---
You got BGS'd.
---
It’s worse now, I just got disconnected twice since I posted this. I can’t take this game anymore 
---
Bad thats why im done with the game till they fix it im level 75 and i havent come across one single explosive gun and hardly any legendary weapons the other day i killed a two star legendary mythical death claw and got nuts and screws and nuclear waste wtf seriously 
---
I would certainly agree. It's probably about 1% of players duping. Either way, the vast majority of good weapons in the game are probably due to dupers...
---
Yes I put a bunch of plans into the overseer's box in Flatwood Church, "follow me"'d a player over to it, they looked at the box and heart emoted me. :)
---
As an Australian playing in the evenings servers are often quiet and the maps so large I'm normally just excited to see another player.  I've started dropping a beer in from of them as a greeting, just wish there was a "nice base" emote.
---
it will go after mods before bulk even.  Try it.  Not a joke.  Well, it's a real joke though, a BGS joke.
---
I often role up to Flat woods in power armour heavy gating laser and drop off hand crafted leather armour modded and upgraded to help them, along side with weapons too. 
---
im guilty of buying caps once
---
.. So that's what happened to my Instigating Fire Axe. Well, nuts.
---
I’m the same. Pump shotty with maxed Enforcer. Get on the car and blow out all their legs.
---
Definitely seems that way for me also.
---
Git gud
---
I didn't knoooooooooooow
---
The gun was loaded
---
And I'm so sorry my friend
---
I didn't knooooooooooow
---
And I'll never never do it again
---
i bought caps to get all 3 mutations i wanted
---
Is “the building” the one enerable from the outside through a hole in the wall that might have been a museum, full of broken display cases, where the plans spawn in one display case and another display case has 5 vases in a row?
---
(I’ve only seen plans, for some other marine piece, once in scores of visits, I assume because this location is on the way from the fast travel point to the vendor)
---
are you really wearing a bathrobe?
---
I thought armor didn’t take damage from PVP, that would be ridiculous if it did 
---
This would have been neat, but the problem is there couldn't be any impactful results from the quest.
---
Being online means they need everyone's game in the same instance. If one person wipes out the ghouls and another the super mutants how could they exist on the same server?
---
Just respawning after the raid would work, but again it would feel like our actions have no effect on the world and are pointless. (Though this is a problem still prevalent in the game now, other than nukes.)
---
I like the idea, and it is similar to what I was expecting. 
---
Patrol Duty for a ranged weapon plan (includes Handmade).  Power Station (any) three times if you don't have all the generators yet.  Camden Park dailies if you care about the costume.
---
Free for anyone passing by "friendly neighbourhood raider" 80% you may get stabbed. 
---
It’ll cripple anything in about three shots or less. I always aim for the legs so I can just melee them at my leisure and not waste more bullets.
---
You may be correct, I hope it doesnt. I do not know for sure.
---
I honestly hadn't thought about that aspect, it's probably great for tagging shit in nuke zones. My nuke zone strategy is to run into the fray, wait for others to tag, and then 1 hit everything with my war drum. 
---
TSE on the Tesla and it fires just like a regular ballistic. No arc.
---
It really feels like the perfect mmo for dad and mum gamers, much less stressful and chilled.
---
I heard you have to get a low level weapon to do some actual damage to low level players
---
I've paid more for less.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
It’s lower cuz each actual mini nuke has that damage but because there are more mini nukes per shot it equals much more damage
---
Sorry to hear that man. Hope it gets better for you. Nothing worse than not being able to play a game you really want to play.
---
Have you tried submitting a ticket?
---
I know lots of people have constant issues, but as often as you’re having seems much worse than what most people seem to be experiencing.
---
Maybe support will be able to help.
---
Cool. I’ll have to keep trying this out
---
I pretty much play the what-can-I-get-done-between-disconnect/crash/freeze game.  That's the game.
---
What would you want to craft with higher durability that isn't already covered by Weapon Artisian/Fix it good?
---
Its probably not the game if you dc that often is what i meant.
---
Beth said they fixed this issue.
---
What's the point outside of greifing though? 
---
this game is lowkey still in beta
---
Too me it’s worth the full price I paid for 🤷🏾‍♂️ I love it
---
&lt;_&lt; SO!
---
You get lower-level legendaries too though.
---
Plenty of leather armor spawns at whitesprings. Even wood if you're into that.
---
So i guess your supposed to grind 30 lvls because through the missing link, the first real quest, I’m level 15 and EVERYTHING YOU COME ACROSS IS EITHER LVL 5 OR 50++++++. This game just has random shit everywhere 
---
Ive put between 150 - 200 hours in so far, so ive definitely got my moneys worth (and I bought the tricentennial edition at full price).
---
I'll let you know if I find any in my adventures.  Any specific legendary effects/ lvl?
---
I think it’s yellowcake, I always have a hassle trying to find it whenever someone nukes the cranberry bog. Much easier time finding flux almost anywhere else.
---
damn that was super funny
---
Me too brah. Me too........
---
I don't *believe* that's still the case. I pretty much 1 shot a level 5 at 45 with a level 40 weapon, and two or three shot a level 25. 
---
You can do it in ESO as well. World bosses are an excellent example, there's maybe a dozen in each zone, and many (most?) of them are absolutely BRUTAL (but still soloable). Have you done a flawless run in vMA? If not, that's something to work towards. Some people manage to pull off absolutely insane stuff, I saw a video of a guy doing veteran Scalecaller Peak solo. To put that into perspective, I've seen full groups of geared CP600+ people wipe on that, for hours, before giving up. 
---
In short, ESO is what you make of it. If you run around killing trash mobs? Yes, it won't be much of a challenge. But the same is true of FO76. When you're lvl 100, Forest is dead to you, as is both Toxic Valley and Ash Heap. Mobs there just die if you fart in their general direction. Even if you're upwind. The Divide and Cranberry are touch and go, a tad challenging, but not really. Worst of all, I can't meaningfully play with lowbies in this game. Either enemies spawn for them, and drop crap loot and give no XP, or the enemies spawn for me and 3-shot the lowbies, and lowbies get loot they can't use for 30+ more levels. So literally nobody is happy. 
---
How? Did you grind to lvl 50 at the beginning of the game? I’m lvl 15 and don’t understand how I’m supposed to grind that much when you get like 22 xp from killing things
---
I can’t imagine what they’ll be able to do. 
---
Hmmmm well I figured it would be a down-but-never-out situation. The player logs on to find that the super mutants have decimated the ghoul area, and if they're a part of the ghoul faction a map marker would pop up telling them where the new base of operations for the ghouls is. Upon arrival the ghouls tell the player what happened. But they have a plan, all they need is a crate of weapons they heard rumors of in an abandoned military base. They need the players' help to retrieve them so they can turn the tides of the on-going war. Something like that any way. 
---
Or you know use a mic

Normally CS agents have access to tools to spawn items and the like. But I don't think there are CS in the traditional online game sense in 76...there isn't even a ticket system in the game so.
---
The scaly skin recipe
---
Excellent! Some of these young players are good and just need a hand, like the rest of us. I do understand the impulse of many adults to avoid kids, but they aren't all annoying. I mean, I wouldn't want to play this with a kid like my 8-year-old. He griefs me a lot when we play Minecraft or Roblox together. And last night my 28-year-old son was playing something else and told me to go make some friends 😭
---
This.  Cheating in a game like this just ruins it for yourself.
---
&gt;You acted in contradiction to your stated belief.
---
submitting to a norm hardly qualifies as a belief. if the majority wants to play make-believe I have no choice but to submit. thus is the rotten nature of online games.
---
&gt;Now P2W
---

---
still not p2w. pay2unlock, sure. but not win.

---
opportunists are also largely viewed as people with no morals, who'd sell their mothers for a profit. that's me.
---
I don't like reddit and I want a healthy market to go fuck itself, but I'll jump the opportunity to get legendaries off the bazaar/market if the opportunity presents itself, even if it contradicts my "beliefs"
---
and I'm definitely getting an instant advantage here. how much do you think I profited before the market got flooded?
---
No
---
*Hides Mauser behind back.*
---
Yes... yes, of course...
---
I use a medium scope on the combat shotgun. It's kind of stupid to have to do so, but it's working out. 
---
My plan is to redo my character and make a meelee playstyle 
---
i kill them all for extra xp
---
I feel the same way u/xxjimmyvrxx
---
I have what I believe to be one of the best looking camps around and I have 15% of my budget locked away with water purifiers. I'm itching up show it off in it's current state, but it's also not up to par as well with part of my moister farm bugged. 
---
Someone did this on my turn to spawn ghouls... the rockets were just annoying so i closed the doors lmao. They got mad as i ran through the remaining ghouls with my power fist 
---
Value wise from the ingame caps its weird for some reason, ive had regular combat rifles that have a way larger cap recommendation that two shot weapons in my inventory, and from what I see, the caps value doesnt change a lot for weapons with legendary effects, so the value as of now is what others will pay for it on here
---
N A C C
---
To add to this - would also be limiting your ability to meet new players who are potentially friendly and helpful. 
---
You’d be stuck with the same lot over and over. As said above, friend feature is implemented already for this! If you don’t want to friend them entirely, that’s what teams for the time being are for, as well. 
---
Account-wide.
---
I can’t figure out how to add more emotes to the wheel (or better said, replace one with another) I bought the CAMP one and haven’t been able to use it.

I'm trying to do the solo run I'm on the quest where o gotta launch a nuke
---
Yeah true that, just wanted to make it clear to people, when it comes to tracking dupes vs. replacing missing items, it'd be two very different teams, with two very different toolsets.
---
Just quit playing like every one else. Im so frustrated that every new game is shit. 
---
I don’t give out higher level or overpowered equipment because that can take a lot of fun out of the game. I’ll drop plans so they have something to look forward to or maybe a legendary item that isn’t too strong. 
---
I couldn't, menu's locked up.
---
As others have mentioned, it have a chance of healing enemies like ghouls and mutants, but I personally don't like it because the ammo for it is expensive to make, and the recoil is extreme compared to other automatic rifles/smg's in the game. 
---
Well, precise stock does not appear to be a rifle stock

Fallout 3 was the first game that hooked me and turned me into a “gamer”.
---
What happens when your base gets damaged? Cant you just move it or blueprint it again?
---
Someone out there doesn't agree with me. That's fine. This applies to you. 
---
I never asked for a definition of market, and definitely not one from you as you clearly don't understand how online games work.
---
yeah, kudos for being able to look up "market" on the saurus. too bad that definition doesn't quite fit what a market is for online games. go ask a Chinese reseller to trade his rare mount for in-game currency and see what happens. *that's* what a market is when it comes to mmos, or pseudo ones.

Love how your lumps all youtubers into hating the game that guy praises the game so your dumb and the game is kinda bad the YouTubers that are crapping on it aren't wrong.
---
It's just full of preservatives. It's the twinkie of fallout. 
---
Hey, thanks again for your previous thread. I spent most of my free time today testing “in the field”. Statistically, I have a pitifully small sample size... let’s say about 40 legendary in various locations over a couple of server hops and etc. (None were in nuke zones, donkt know if that’s relevant but FYI)
---
Seems pretty legit from everything I could easily test. I do stealth melee with All Rise, so a fair amount of lvl 50-65 mobs can be one hit kills. Can confirm that all instakills gave @#$&amp; loot, but if it went multiple hits, I usually got something worthwhile.
---
Interesting side note, bot legendary enemies would always drop good stuff if they explode after dying, but trash drops did not explode. Really seems like something needing a few seconds of combat to “activate”...
---
Oh crap and now the power core keeps recharging...
---
What system you on? I'm pc and I've never have problems like that. I get dc'd time to time but I can easily play 8hours + without a problem 
---
You don't Sport, move on unlike yourself some of us like to organize communities and provide PSA's :)

I’m guessing you started it and picked on him first.

&gt;	 5. What does All Night Long exactly do? (= does it lower the negative effects of hunger/thrist, or does it make me get hungry/thirsty slower?)

It lowers the negative effects of hunger/thirst: /r/fo76/comments/a25anj/

I’ve read you should go the other way, increasing the positive effects of well fed and well hydrated with Rejuvenated: /r/fo76/comments/9tkvsf/

/u/lonevaultwanderer can I get input on this please? I can try and pm a video but this was a major blow to my resources.

I mean I’m able to play the division and destiny non stop without disconnects. Just not this game

You’re right, upvotes don’t make me right. Facts do.
---
A proper patch according to you happened on December 11th. The Notes: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a575z2/fallout_76_patch_notes_december_11_2018/
---
It’s filled woth fixes and features that were heavily requested.
---
As for December 19, what that “hotfix” did was fix crashing on PC when trying to exit, fix apparently out of date clients on PC being able to play, removed one of the methods used to dupe and fixed the issue of high damage or explosive weapons doing no damage or causing enemies to heal.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7m2hl/hotfix_notes_december_19_2018/
---
These were all big annoying issues that people kept asking for a fix.
---
The “hotfix” in quotes is because real hotfixes don’t require updates or maintenance to implement, they’re data pulled from the internet and persist until you quit the game. Even for an online-only game, making me download and install an update makes it a patch nkt a hotfix.
---
Bethesda chose the term because someone wanted to lower expecstions because less was done this time around which was stupid. It doesn’t the matter the size and number of things done, it’s the impact they have. Even if it was a real hotfix the fact that these issues were fixed that were plaguing many people is great.
---
You keep opening your mouth and making claims when you haven’t played the game lately nor bothered to do a couple minutes of research of what’s been done to it.
---
It keeps blowing up in your face so you backpeddle and move the goal posts to try and salvage your original statement. 
---
If you keep saying December 19th doesn’t count because it doesn’t do enough by your own arbitrary criteria despite addressing several core, pressing issues again I’m going to laugh.
---
 
---
The story was shit and the scenery wasn't that encapsulating so I rushed the game to find more content. That's why.
---
Got your response. Did some testing with friends. If you try and camp inside your base the Attackers can blow up your base with impunity until they claim you. Afterwords you will gain wanted like normal. If the target has a bounty on them you will claim that first before the quest completes so you'll need to kill them twice.
---
My 10 cap bounty is from a stray bullet hitting a structure while defending a stranger's workshop. I think an orbital strike in response would be a little overkill. 
---
That's some bullll, pvp is so broken in this game lol. I was holding the munitions factory and a lvl 125+ decided he wanted it so he jumped up really high popped a stealth boy and shot me through my xo1 w a single shot
---
Where's that event?
---
PSA pretty sure they could do whatever they want, despite it being an inconvenience to you. It’s a wasteland after all. Lol 
---
This.
---
It shouldn’t work this way but that’s how it is at the moment.
---
At least make sure they aggro on you.
---
You can sell them to new ish players in flatwoods or by the vault
---
Did this really never come up during beta? (or is this the beta...?) Because if it did, Bethesda should have fixed it. If it didn't, then they didn't have enough people playing the beta. Either way it really is Bethesda's fault. 
---
I mean I guess we could have accidentally dropped them somehow?? but I just don’t see myself doing that. 
---
I’ve accidentally scrapped stuff before but it was a legendary so that’s not it.
---
Bummer.
---
Same. Gotten one of these and a Ghoul Slayer's Radium Rifle. Both felt like a kick in the teeth.
---
That's really strange. I had great connection during that time surprisingly when all the new players started joining.
---
I know it's probably common and you've done it but Check your WiFi with the ps4 (even tho I imagine your psn is fine just 76)
---
My imagination would be to say Ps4 has people trying to duplicate items often causing server issues 
---
Thanks might just stand in front of the vaults doors waiting for a person to appear
---
And this last disconnect came with a price too. I equipped my hunting rifle because I had about 2,000 bullets in my inventory for it. Then I get kicked and come back on and all my bullets for that hunting rifle are gone. Even the ones in the gun lmao, wtf
---
Just combat.For other armors you have to pay separately.
---
It is used in the distant thunder event that shows up in the bog.
---
You tag scorched with the scope until you have 6 tagged, then the artillery barrage hits em.
---
You’re awesome
---
Switching from first/third person to first/third cancels it when you land.
---
Switching, putting away, or pulling your weapons out cancels it when landing.
---
Crouching while in third person when you're landing will cancel it. For some reason this one doesn't work in first person.
---
I wouldn't be surprised. With certain weapons, PvP in this game is a total joke.
---
I use a lot of mods and ive even tried using cheat engine and i havent been banned. (I used cheat engine because last patch the game was so laggy and i kept getting DC and random freezes, so i said fuck it and was ready to get banned. The game was then brought back to a playable condition and i am happily playing the game now.)
---
Yeah, since New Years he has almost exclusively had only the radium rifle plan and one other.
---
I’ve had the list of plans populate properly exactly once.
---
I got one shot by a level 122 yesterday, im L13, no idea why i was wanted though, i hadnt shot anyone ever unless i accidentally hit someone during an event.
---
Amazon does price adjustments/refunds when something is purchased within a certain time period on stuff they control. IE.. if I bought something today for $5 and tomorrow their distributors mark it down to $4, they will give me a $1 refund.
---
if you had them in your stash, they might be back there after the disconn.   there seems to be some kind of hack rollback the dupers use this for duping from what I hear.  GL.
---
I honestly have no idea
---
You’re a hero.
---
Right that's what I commented these guys just come off as fanboy crybabies.
---
Thanks, I checked and they’re gone from the stash too
---
Nope. Was actually helping my low level friend and just died instantly without a chance to do anything. He sniped me I think. My pacifist mode in on 100% of the time (and I realized the game doesn't automatically turn it off,  which was interesting when I first tried to get revenge). 
---
Build a second set of stairs on a foundation. 
---
Amusing that they include Easter eggs regarding the modding community in FO4, but they ban anyone that attempts to mod FO76
---
Not without glitching into it. none of the vaults are open yet.
---
This drives me MFing crazy.
---
Decon arches cant be placed under the stair/floor combo. They automatically move I up to the floor above. However, i cant actually place it on the 2nd floor from the start.
---
Also the thru wall connector (conduit). Does the same thing
---
Wall cabinet (stash box) doesnt snap to any wall, only half way through the floor.
---
Pressure trigger (floor switch) cant be placed on the second floor.
---
I havent had an issue with the 2nd style  of power armor stations on a lower floor (besides the stair combo).
---
Keeping workshops is a nightmare so thank you 
---
I’ve never had a camp on a resource.
---
My resource would be my adhesive farm I guess, I’ve got quite a few crops (and with green thumb and super duper no have so much adhesive I leave bulk adhesive everywhere)
---
Showing your age there buddy.
---
The players are about 60-75% of what is wrong with the game. “Why does this piece of shit keep crashing?!?” Oh, I don’t know ‘420DrAgOnAlPhAwArRiOr69, maybe it’s because you’re running around with 2000 lbs worth of junk, ammo, weapons, armor, and fusion cores?
---
I meant forever. Unless you like wasting time for no reason of course. 
---
Check it in what way? To see if it’s connected?
---
ohhhhhh, ty
---
Which stairs? The big ones or just the first one?
---
I think it's because most of us in the fallout games always chose to be like wasteland jesus we helped everyone and sure through our second or third playthrough we blew up megaton or killed everyone or even sided with the enclave and purified the wasteland but always our first character was a pure soul
---
I swear, 99% of all posts in this sub are "please nerf/change/add X mechanics because I fucked up and want a safety net"
---
Yeah, I really don't go out of my way to grind at all.  I'm Level 56 at this point.
---
I definitely feel like the game itself is slowing down though.  Once you're able to take down a Scorchbeast with modest effort, something is lost.  The fun of traveling from one location to another on-foot becomes less thrilling because you know there's nothing that can really stop you anymore.
---
I'm also really surprised how, for as many enemy types exist in this game, how seldom they are used.  I've traveled nearly the entire world in what's probably 90 hours.  I've *never* seen a Sloth.  I've only found Honey Beasts once.  And yet whenever I pass through Summersville, it's the same tired Super Mutants in the same tired positions again.  They really should have done more to vary the spawns.
---
Hello there
---
Aw cause they not praising a broken game like they did in the past.
---
The spawn for the area was in the same spot, so they just kept hitting me almost immediately, but I couldn't damage them until they shot first. These dudes tanked multiple TSE Handmade shots. With the spawn in the same spot and no access to my menus, I couldn't do shit.
---
I thought it was Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel. 
---
Well to be fair I was trying to get a safety net removed to save time
---
Change server. Base is rebuilt for free. Avoided harsh punishment
---
Yes
---
I want to feel like I'm in the armor...
---
Hmmm.
---
Rolling pin with increased damage from vats, greater accuracy in vats (I think!) and reduced AP cost in VATS
---
See so either the people who were banned were doing something super game breaking or they lied
---
That is so freaking awful lol. This is probably on the bottom of the long list of things to fix bit I hope they get to it soon. Thanks for the tip on the PA Station!
---
Thats crazy, this is the first time I hear of griefing that bad, what level are you currently that they were one shotting you? 
---
Shut up
---
This is my ideal:
---
1) Vanguard's
---
2) Powered 
---
3) Cavalier
---
I guess. I haven't touched a console since the ps4 got originally announced. (other than the Switch) so my understanding on Morden consoles is very low. 
---
Does that noticeably affect hip fire spread or something?
---
I’ll be able to run it tomorrow.  I have to get ready to sleep for school.
---
God damn that is gorgeous 
---
Or I'm the reason new players are over-encumbered before they reach level 3.
---
That...is...the most idiotic form of gamer “logic” I have heard in a while. Seriously.
---
True enough 
---
Oh, you're right I'll fix the name, but the console version is just called Fallout: Brotherhood of steel. 
---
Nice catch, and thanks for pointing that out!
---
Exactly 
---
It's an online game with tradeable currency. Did no one expect gold sellers? They're in every MMO
---
It's a pvp event, enjoy the company! It's why I stopped doing it .. it WAS my favorite event till I found that out. 
---
Sounds good.  What system are you on btw I forgot to ask earlier.
---
i’ve been dropping things that are higher than my level at train station containers (lunch box in watoga, for example) otherwise it seems crappy that i get 8 caps each from vendors for level 50 power armor pieces
---
When I need to organize and clear some space in my stash, I take the excess to the overseer's cache in flatwoods. Dropped off a two shot crossbow the other day. 
---
Down vote me all you want keep supporting and buying these broke ass games and the devs will be more than happy to keep pumping them out. 
---
Spare batteries fixes that.  Like, so much so it’s ridiculous 
---
there's no reason why taking someone's junk should initiate a duel. shouldn't have shot yourself up.
---
I wouldn't trust some of the reviews given out. At first I thought the same thing. Then when I actually played the game and then looked at the reviews, it's pretty obvious some of then never played the game. I just bought it on sale and dont regret it yet.
---
Bethesda never should have put that ridiculous shit in the game on the first place but since it's in and isn't going to go away, may as well use it.
---
They ought to make it so anyone who is there can loot any body until it disappears. You may not get xp but at least you can farm, which is all there is to the game at this point
---
Sorry, missed that part of my comment where I said I was flabbergasted at people cheating, exploiting the game, and selling in-game items. Yeah no shit people pay for gold in MMO's. Usually there isn't a readily available exploit that lets you just dupe money and items in those though.
---
Does your lifesaving gear actually work? I've never been revived by mine.
---
I wonder if you could dupe it somehow (I know duping is bad and I don’t do it either) and if that would stop the game script from removing it from your inventory 
---
Damn I'm on xbox.  Sorry man
---
Rapidly toggling crouch is the international sign for “don’t kill me I’m sorry.”
---
Works IRL too. 
---
Okay that’s a fair point
---
This may be minor, but replacing all but the first rank of Adrenaline with more Bloody Mess or other +5% perks might be good, since each rank after rank 1 is adding only between 0% and 6% per rank situationally, while the alternatives would be always adding 5% per rank.
---
You can just drop them one of the containers at the overseer's camp. That way they persist when you log out. 
---
Hey, it is appreciated anyways!
---
Exactly love how they blame YouTubers for talking about a broken empty game and unsub from them cause they not praising it. Dumb ass fanboys

/r/nocontext

Yep, learned this when I found a dude hanging out way out in the mountains in his C.A.M.P. Hit the side of the building with many, many grenades from the auto launcher with no repercussions.

Another fun fact, you can pick their doors, resource extractors and water purifiers too. Don't break the law and then go home kiddies.

That said, I think this is chump talk. "Hey you, don't use your best weapons to farm cuz I'm a level 50 and I want credit for all the kills and all the loot despite just standing here like a pimple on an ass trying to shoot everything once with my cool pipe rifle"
---
i’m loving it, level 34 now. only frustrating thing is when level 100+ players are in an area where i need to do a quest activity, i know the enemies leveled to them will ruin me.  so i switch to a different quest line and different area. thankfully following several different quest lines so it’s NBD

As of right now, no.

Man, when I learned that all I needed to be looking for were damn clipboards, I was so happy.  That made that weekend so much better.

From what i've found out with my group, how your second clip has missile but no missile launcher means if someone else had tagged it they would have had a chance to see a missile Launcher.

I've pulled out the cannonballs that were with my teammates 2 Star broadsider, like he watched me do it.

You can get faster reload perk for shotguns otherwise speed demon mutation

Oxhorn found this during the Greenbrier event. 😂
---
Yeah they mad at all YouTubers right now cause they not praising a broken game.
---
I was enjoying it until I got into a nuclear silo tonight for the first time. Game kept disconnecting from the server temporarily. Finally I quit to menu and rejoined. All the stimpacks I had used were gone but none of the junk I had picked up was present. It was aggravating. 
---
For example, vault tec bed plans dont unlock anything, the bed with the vault tec sheets that looks clean is called “modern bed”
---
Yea make sure if u do it u don't have a lot of good junk on u

146. And because of the conditions of whatever bugged, I couldn't do damage to them unless they shot back, but even if I decided not to shoot them they could do full damage to me anytime. I have two Two-Shot/Exp guns and an explosive shotty that did nothing.
---
They were 76 and 93 I believe.
---
I am not at all trying to say the system is objectively bad. That is just my experience with the system. After getting to level 50, the game was okay, just a little more than I wanted to keep up with going on. But I hated the entire "leveling" process.
---
I started slow like you, but around lvl 27 i wanted to get to 50 so i could freely choose any perk and anything i picked up would be lvl 50 so i can keep using it instead of picking up a cool lvl 30 weapon knowing that i would have to replace it later. Also i would rather explore the map with cool weapons which are fun to use instead of using a hunting rifle or melee weapon and then when i finally get a more fun weapon later on, ive already explored the whole map. My want to lvl up also coincided with me discovering a really easy way for a low lvl to lvl up safely and fast so i leveled up fast and made a nice build which made it more fun to explore. Atm im in the process of farming more lvls so i can switch my build to something else and then ill go explore some more.

Agreed.  Unfortunately I am still enjoying this game (besides the incredibly frustrating crashes) and I have put hours into it and have enjoyed all Fallout games before it so it’s difficult to just walk away from it.
---
The only “solution” I have found are constantly teaming up with others just so I can at least join back into the ‘world’ when I get either disconnected, the game crashes, or the game freezes. (Currently level 109).
---
My game crashes frequently and not under any certain circumstance.  I’ve been in anything from looking at my map, in the middle to fighting to scorched queen and even just picking up some vegetation.  I can occasionally get an hour or so without crashing but it can happen within 2 minutes of logging on.
---
I’ve tried reinstalling, updating, removing save files, hard rebooting... I think everything.
---
As I write this I realize how insane I must sound in playing a “broken” game.
---
Things like this are what I love the Fallout series for. Did you have a locale on the sticky?
---
Did you submit it to bug reports?
---
They may save you buying a broken unplayable game genius.
---
 You are a good boi!
---
Love reading stories like this. Thank you for sharing WizardFroth.
---
why would i?
---
Oh wow, I thought it was a prank post it , like “Reminder: switch Karen’s toilet paper with sandpaper” kinda prank. 
---
TIL indeed 
---
I found that place but it is awful close to a fissure.  How bad do the scorchbeasts bother you?  They still eat up all my ammo and stimpacks to have them as neighbors.
---
And I don't really have people to farm nukes or the queen with so resources Ive gathered are pretty precious.
---
Nice! My ign is Ariyx and just added you.

For a world that was afraid of nuclear bombs for over a century I think at some point down the line being nuclear-proof was a trend in products so that people might buy a lot of that product to stack up in case there was a nuclear attack

I had no problem with it until today, then everything was empty.  Popped again later and no issues.

Oh, lol, yeah Im kind of a sucker tbh at this point.

Same, I enjoy the bounty hunters coming for me, makes for some fun battles and me running around with the "Help Me" emote spam
---
BS no one us getting one shot with slap damage I hear this all the time I would love to see proof
---
Bloatflies, Mirelurk Kings or if you want them to really stop, up to 5 scorchbeasts. No one else can attack them except the duper and even if they attack it always does 1 damage mo matter what. Gotta be cruel to make a point sometimes.

Not sure why when I searched I didn't find the other posts people mentioned it.  Second time today it had materials but first time was empty.

Duel monitor setup. The game is set to Fullscreen mode on one monitor yet sometimes the game  lets go of my mouse when I swing it across the screen (enemy to my left I move my mouse to hit the guy and the game lets go of my mouse as it ends up on my desktop on the other screen). 
---
It’s a radioactive wasteland.

Also your character looks like Tom Cruise from Tropic Thunder

Well if you need someone for nuke runs I can help whenever! And ill help you out with resources you dont have enough of in rebuilding your camp 👍🏻

*Extremely easy fix* REmOvE ExPLOsIveS 
---
&gt;These people do mean things that involve the game I like THEY SHOULD DIE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Exactly this is probably one of the ban of redditors that was blaming YouTubers for the hate fallout 76 has when all they did was post about the problems.
---
I'm lvl 64, and there was at least 2 other lvl 100s besides them

Scattershot under str
---
no that was a missile.
---
It's because the player spawns in before the buildings. If your fast travel mat is in your house and you spawn in, you drop into the foundations and the house spawns around you if you're not quick enough to move. Then you have to fast travel away to get out.
---
Power armour is king in the nuke zone.
---
Out of the nuke zone though you can augment builds to be even better with normal armour
---
A teammate and I were at the Mega Stop clearing out muties. I was inside and he darted in after a while. I shot him out of pure reflex but no harm done.
---
Perfect 
---
Is there not an app you can use with playstation for party chat? The xbox app can be used for party chat using the phones microphone
---
Hey mate thanks for the feedback. I've shared this suggestion with the team before but I'm going to let them know about this thread too.
---
Sending request, I hope you’re still holding :)
---
Enter build mode and move the camp module somewhere else. It'll change your spawn point for fast travel.
---
My workaround is public now, yes that’s how you get rid of the annoying ones! 
---
You can hear me? Thats impressive
---
You are looking WAY to into this.  It's a simple issue. I like the tattoo, I don't like the placement of it.  As players, we should have the option to choose where it goes.  It's not about wanting to shirk societal standards like you seem to think, to try and make this a big issue.
---
I couldnt finish a quest because it was bugged so i moved on but when it happened a second time 20 lvls later that really did it for me. 
---
Funny I have a monster mask from the monster mash event that does that when I take it off as well
---
I should add another more interesting thing. I went into someone's camp and a cave cricket was inside. I shot and missed. It said I attacked his structure and I became wanted. A higher level person capped me and took my stuff.
---
This community is awesome &lt;3
---
I think this was staged. 
---
*You know, this cat Phoenix here is a bad mother-*
---
Yeah..... keep thinking that. And Bethesda will keep screwing you over.
---
Dude the people on THIS SUB do the same exact thing. 
---
I'm getting into arguments with tards on here saying that the cap system is worthless and horribly designed, and then that they've been using the cap exploit the whole time. Fucking what!?
---
The same people say the game is also horribly designed because of the weight and stash limitations, so they are FORCED to use the carry weight glitch. What!?
---
Like the narrative is that the game isn't well designed literally comes from people that have been cheating and exploiting since day one. Go figure. 
---
Should have slept in their bed and played their banjo too (if they had one).
---
I really want to know what people think when they unlock their doors and come in to my character either sleeping on their bed or just jamming out
---
You make your base far enough below and you will never be in the nukezone
---
i am but i don't see you
---
This community is wonderful.  This is a killer story
---
No reason to think this had anything to do with the mod, and more to do with the argument humans have about toilet paper orientation everywhere.
---
Logging in now.  Slow internet lol
---
Are you kidding? Whether they partake in duping or not doesn't discredit the fact that duping can happen **at all.** The reason why no one can enjoy the game is FO76 being a steaming turd due to Bethseda never learning from their decades-old mistakes. I'm glad the true Bethesda fans are holding them to a higher standard than Bethesda themselves.
---
When I was lvl 9ish, still during the beta, a level 20 came up to me and gave me a power armor frame and several *fully charged* cores for absolutely no reason. I started crying immediately (granted, it had been a very long day before that). Luckily I didn’t have voice chat on at the time so I didn’t completely embarrass myself. 
---
Granted, I’ve overheard a fair amount of assholes too, but now with Push To Talk they’re quiet so I can pretend they don’t exist ;)
---
...
---
.........I dont even fcking use power armor
---
To be fair you were dead and left no will.
---
Which that youtuber never complained about the game. Stop joining the hat mob.
---
I didn't try to rush, I didnt do any lvl glitches but I quickly got to 70-80 falling out with friend group I played this with made it a bit hard to get back into. I dont know how people can slow grind this game
---
It might be due to the enemy's damage reduction -- 6 weaker nukes going through DR 6 times will end up worse off than 1 big one going through once
---
I appreciate the offer on resources but a lowbie buddy helped me out with some resources after I helped him build his base the other night.
---
But Im down for nuke runs anytime, PSN is ToochieMcTooch, not sure if your PSN is the same as your username.
---
Not if Bethesda keeps doing what they do.
---
They didn't fix duping, not even the method they attempted too, they didn't fix crashing to desktop, I have no idea of they fixed the damage bug but I doubt it.  They used the term hotfix because that's what it was and you are an idiot, it's a fact and we know how much you claim to like those while not being able to do math and making up word definitions. I wish it was an insult but I mean come on we're not even dealing with triple digits here and we have google and you still can't figure this stuff out.
---
I jus kill wanted players for the pvp fun, I'll leave their camps alone. Most wanted players are only wanted by accident so wiping their camp is prob unfair in many cases. 
---
Judging by the volume of in game items being peddled on eBay now, I think it is people duplicating en masse, the server list just can't handle it and if overruns and that server instance crashes the client.
---
Generally a good bit of advice, just remember that at 10 caps it was probably an accidental offense.  Once it gets above that however, have fun.  
---
I have never seen the latter two drop for leather in this game
---
Amateur
---
You do it in front of them. Dont wait for them to get home.
---
Stroll past them, right into bed. Give them a punch on the way back out and drop 1x spoiled meat.
---
How so?
---
I'd say the most practical location is in the Savage Divide.  You have free fast travel to Vault 76 already, but being in the Divide makes you roughly equidistant from Harper's Ferry and Watoga Station.

Stupid opinion.
---
PSN: birdJP19 if Im not on shoot me a reddit or ps4 message, I stopped doing silos alone after the risk of disconnecting and losing my nuke pretty much
---
Part of the issue is most mmo's only have good content at the end and everything else is an on rails slog to get to end game. It's a problem of recent game development. Though there is the Bartel's Dichotemy of Online Players where a sizable amount fall under Killers and Achievers so get high level fast is what's important, highly recommend reading on it, its quite interesting 
---
Yawn you asked me to look things up and I did.
---
You're a hypocrite. All this time trying to educate on what a market is and even said you don't see the problem "blah blah blah" but then don't follow your own views on it. You trade in caps like most of us and yeah first day man. Coming from an account that's been sat here for a year got barely any posistive feedback per days spent. Probably because you have to log heads with the majority of people on here or just that people find your views, suggestions and comments uninformative and dull. 
---
You resort to personal attacks and then when you ask for definitions, disregard them. Sure the Chinese sell shit but your missing what I've been saying. 
---
Trading between two people is the in game market. You use FO76Bazaar yourself. 
---
Trading in game items for real world cash is illegal and against Bethesdas Terms of Service. 
---
Your choosing to ignore the definitions and replacing them with your own views or childish remarks. 
---
1. Your a hypocrite for by NOT using real world money for your purchases and sales on the game. Your posts have asked for caps therefore CONTRADICTING what you are trying to argue. 
---
2. Paying to Win is NOT the act of obtaining something unobtainable (come on now, if it unobtainable how do you buy it, clue is in the unobtainable part)
---
Paying to Win is the act of spending Real World Money to purchase an item that will give you an advantage. Using Real World Money to upgrade from a non legendary shotgun to a 2SE Shotgun is gaining an advantage from previous circumstances. 
---
Another example is Warframe. I could play the game to earn items to sell for Platinum. I could use my Platinum to buy God mode mods. 
---
I could also buy Platinum with my real money then purchase the mods. That is giving me an advantage and therefore I'm paying to Win. HOWEVER the Platinum was NEVER UNOBTAINABLE. 
---
3. An opportunist takes IMMEDIATE advantage of a situation. Posting on a subreddit and waiting for a response is not IMMEDIATE. 
---
4. I know your just here to argue because you asked for definitions and then denied them. I'm guessing with your interaction and the posts you have posted you're just another fly-by player whose salty over something. I mean questions about how explosives work and that your vats doesn't work as intended and a few more trade posts doesn't scream real player. 
---
If you believe in your version of the market go buy some guns. If your DUMB enough to spend YOUR cash on an in game item for a game you have ALREADY  paid for because you can't be arsed farming. Go right ahead. No skin of my back. If you honestly think that this game needs this sort of market then you truly don't play enough. If you think that this game and its player base can sustain a system that charges $20 for a single weapon then you are deluded. 
---
It's fallout 76 it isn't like the mmos you like referencing. Learn that's it's a different game. Understand that the premise of a real world market would not hold on a game like this with all the duping and glitches. 
---
And for the love of god look in a dictionary yourself before you jump up trying to be yet another keyboard warrior who talks big with no backup and grow a pair of balls to actually make sure your following through with what your saying before you come at someone else. 
---
You have yet to purchase a gun for real money, you do not sell your guns for real money. You have spent hours explaining how there is no market but follow the in game market and use the tools. 
---
You ask for "man child" currency when you trade, don't attempt to look down your nose at others for doing the same. 
---
Phoenix is jacked yeah, but Dominatrix Assaultron would shit all over that bum.
---
Same here, Ill hit you up.
---
Lowkey?
---
You’ve convinced me I need to use it at white springs. Brb 
---
Not if you need cobalt flux
---
Could you give an example? I'm using melee weapons myself.
---
My hair disappeared when I was 20 and I dont even wear hats.. wtf
---
Just like their other bugs.
---
Real question. How? I'm at around 80 hours and aboutn that same level. I felt I was fucking about a ton though, the game just gives out levels so easily when questing
---
Depends on your lvl. Early on PA is far superior but later on you can get BoS heavy combat armor which gives enough DR and ER to be on the same level as PA. Normal armor also has the benefit of there being legendaries with special effects which makes it far superior to power armor. With normal armor you can also pair the perks white knight and lucky break to NEVER have to repair your armor again. I dont know what kind of explosion defense PA has but normal armor can get the Dense mod for the chest which reduces explosion damage by a lot. With normal armor you also dont have to pick up fusion cores and carry them around.
---
Your guy looks just as surprised as you were lol
---
Nope. Just like how there's no anti armor perk for pistols.
---
Fortunetly rifles aren't invalidated because they're heavy
---
I've seen Graham fight a level 91 deathclaw and a lvl 80 scorchbeats at the same time
---
Nope, and I guess thats for balance since rifles are overall best.
---
Modern bed that I know for sure. But I think vault tec beds unlocks more of the shitty metal beds without covers. 
---
I've spoken to people that have admitted to duping, but it's only happened once "organically" meeting them while I was playing. He offered me a bunch of stuff but I just ended up taking 2k rounds of .38 for my pipe rifle, and whether that was or wasn't duped I don't particularly care.  
---
I have definitely noticed that the servers I play on crash a lot more often late at night/early in the morning (like 2-5am) and I'm fairly certain that's from people duping stuff. Usually happens after several minutes of lag and dropped packets too. 
---
I want to come home to that. I have numbers writing out the password for my door right next to the keypad so some guests can "break in" 
---
I wish this happened to me often, I love this game but it is frustrating to try and get materials (especially screws...) when every location is already emptied.
---
Uhh, I truly don’t know ☹️ 
---
Eh. Sort of. 
---
I stay out of power armor most of the time, but I'm a sniper. *However*, if you were to augment armor to get even close to the damage reduction PA gives, it would take an immense amount of perks. 
---
You'd be better off just wearing the PA. 
---
That's what I end up doing, I carry a set or two with me, and equip it if fighting a scorchbeast. 
---
Two shot bloodied berserker fat man mirv launcher. The glassest cannon. 
---
Guess the Karma thing didn’t work here.  Thank you very much!!

Or for when you press the button to tab over to their inventory just after they leave the trade and you punch them in the face.
---
No probs
---
I only use power armour so I'm not sure 
---
Vanguard pieces.
---
Have 80% rads in health.
---
You’re +15 in all stats.
---
You’re a glass cannon but a damn powerful glass cannon.
---
Same for stealth builds with chameleon effects, I can sneak right up to almost anything and lick the inside of their ear and they still won’t detect me.
---
As far as I can tell the way food and water works is that it generates a fruit/bottle into a random not-yet-full plant/generator once every N seconds.  More plants/generators don’t increase that rate; they only increase the total number of fruits/bottles your workshop or camp will hold that haven’t yet been picked up, since each plant/generator can only hold 1 or 2 or 5 items.  Better numbers adjust N so that it happens more often.
---
No, which is great...so I'm stuck carrying out 3 20 pound weapons. 
---
Meanwhile my friend has a 2 pound fatman. Alright. 
---
Sweet, will start checking that one more regularly. Thanks
---
I use the Irradiated emote as a substitute for now.
---
I know... i love pvping but no one wants to fight me so i have to go after wanted players or workshops 
---
Right? And there’s 7 of them, you would think one would be on the ball with this big of a sub. 
---
I remember the beta thread was up way after launch too. Something about only the mod who sticked a post can in-sticky it. 
---
Can I have some? Healing salves only work so well lol 
---
I disagree I can run around in my t51 and the only thing that kills me is the lvl 91 deathclaw or scorchbeats queen
---
Not sure, I was definetly the only one over there at that point because everyone else was using their Tse at the resort. I decided to not bother with them. It very well could be I'm not 100% sure honestly. 
---
Aside from the nuke zone issue, you can set up your non-power armor up pretty nicely if you slowly farm certain legendaries.
---
Right now I have an armor set on my guy with a ton of -weapon weight effects. It's so strong that I dont even bother putting on the bear arms perk when I'm not in power armor, despite having a massive arsenal of heavy weapons on my character (8 in total, plus a non-heavy weapon explosive sub gun, an all rise super sledge and anti-armor power fist).
---
I've been thing about working toward getting a -damage when sprinting armor set (or standing still instead). If I get enough, it could be a fun change in style.
---
Still though, as a heavy weapons guy I still am a bit forced to go power armor, what with the stability perk being my main way of getting accuracy and armor pen.
---
Turned lvl 100 today and fought her 4 or 5 times and I can agree more low levels are popping in. I believe it is because they think “If I shoot it and let the high levels get it done for me. Then I get loot for doing nothing!) Which if it is the case then don’t pick them up when they down. If you pick them up your encouraging them that you have their backs. Instead let them die over and over, let all their weapons break and let them run out of ammo. Its like if a ant tried to take on a tank but the ant had 10+ people with rocket launchers aimed at said tank. 
---
Holidays my guy, it was the holidays. They have families and deserve a break too. 
---
Yeah Im interested in where they take it. Im level 115 I think and I have taken to just always keeping a Bounty on me to liven up the game a bit.. most people just ignore the bounty it seems but it adds a fresh layer to my daily grind
---
imagine realizing the place youre building them at is filled with those blue plastic baskets and those are filled with clipboards.  
---
Well blame this guy. Asshole.

---
You say that as if fallout 76 is literally unplayable. I'm playing it right now lol I'm not saying it's perfect but I think a lot of people listen to youtubers who shit on something without giving it a chance themselves. 
---
It was just to let people know. If they want to waste their time and have me break their base that's their loss. 
---
I'll start stuffing him with things from now on. Some .38's, modded low level pipe guns and so on so it's useless to a random high level passerby but will help a new char. I used to check Flatwoods and Overseer's camp for low levels and made modded Pipe Rifles for them along with some ammo until now. 
---
Agreed. 
---
What kind of a reply is that lol. You do get that everyone has those TSE weapons nowadays, it's just that people consider other people around them before doing stuff like oneshotting everything before other people could tag it.. Plus really.. how hard is it to invest into either a tesla rifle or even better the tesla chest.. just run next to the mobs and everything is tagged, let the new players have their fun as well..
---
Then quit using tse's lol. Most of us don't have one yet. I got lucky and got a semi auto quad ammo tesla rifle.
---
I have a tower home with an observation deck overlooking white springs. Would enjoy an evaluation 
---
Don't feel to bad. I was level 68 before I found out that the left directional button on a PS4 controller was a hotkey to apply stimpacks. Before then, I would open the Pip-Boy, click over to aid, scroll down and manually apply a stimpack. Oh, damaged again? Open Pip-Boy, scroll down aid to stimpack and manually apply it. I discovered the hotkey by accident trying to figure out how to emote, lol. 
---
Is bad luck, I’ve fought the Whitespring one a heap of times and only once did it dodge roll inside the wall upon death. Every other time its lootable
---
I too screamed. Although as I am biological female its much more socially exceptable, most likely expected. I was level 12 whenI saw mine first. It was level 35. I told my friend we should kill it he said hell no. I shot it and if flew up and I ran. I managed to survive my attempted assault but I play to be prepared with a mini nuke next time. I have to get a mini nuke first however.....
---
Yeah I try to run around and whack the legendary once and let who ever else around get a hit on it. Cause I 2 shot everything now.
---
Thanks!
---
Where do you think Johnny got it from, jackass?
---
I think he means stealth beta, like it’s not officially on beta but for the most part it actually is.u agree, the game needed another six months of work on bugs and QoL issues, IMO.
---
And fake internet points or not again looking back at the start. More downvotes for you more up for me. Regardless of karma, the people pressing those buttons are real people. They have voices and opinions just like you and me and are free to agree or disagree. 
---
You've not received and posistive praise for your deluded ways because your arrogant. You type down the end of your nose to others. Some players have spoken and they say no to Real World Currency on this game. Buhbye now! Come back when your not copy pasting the same crap again and again. 
---
All they said is January, which just started, so give it some time.
---
Can confirm that this hasnt changed a thing for me, and I was never one shotting them in the first place.
---
never used power armor, level 53 now. worst part: getting made fun of by other level 50+ bros for being a "scrub"
---
I would also welcome a /shrug.  I have pacifist turned on, anyway.
---
Didn’t FO4 have this for Vim in the DLC? That was one of my favorite things to do, crafting soda and I don’t even know why it was oddly satisfying.
---
Like to know too but as far as I know if it does no one has reported it yet.
---
I always leave a bag of spoiled meat on their bed and open all of the shutters.

I (used to) play on Xbox one. I ran into the same issue. It would freeze up and be completely disconnected and booted back to the Xbox homepage. Then I’d start the game up again and hop back on.  It happened I think like 4-5 times in a span of 2 days. I lost my patience with this game. I really liked playing it and I was very entertained but this was my last straw. I’ll definitely play again sometime but I just hope they release an update or something soon. 
---
I think he was saying it like "Lowkey" being an understatement. Could be wrong tho.
---
Alright, just wondering cause super excited n was wondering if they just updated us with info or anything
---
I definitely deployed. I remember putting it out and almost getting into it before remembering my armor's chem and ammo weight reductions.
---
Did they take a workshop from you?
---
Again you're right I use it with a maxed perception rifles build, but I personally like the slowed/stopped time style. Also yes I know it can't be the case seeing as it an online game, and I can live with it, I just don't consider it a favourite. 
---
My favorite is when I murder a level 68 glowing 3 star diseased ghoul and get a 1 star level 40 shitty leather leg.   Good times.  Happened twice tonight.   I'm level 77.  
---
I have all three unlocked in the launcher and downloadable, so for people on PC at least its already happened or is happening.
---
Had this a couple of days ago on ps4, these guys took my fortress down to match sticks, their wanted level stayed at 5 despite the damage they cause. When I logged back in the following day it took 7 “repair all’s” to repair all.. even then a lot of the structure still show durability loss and equipment looks rusty and damaged now. Took my arguably excessive junk storage down from 600 to 473. What kind of motivation does someone have to destroy a base? Revenge I get, but malice does not compute with me. Defending your base from an attack sounds like fun but just falls flat imo in the future I’ll just server hop or close app

could be worse in 3.5 I played a psion and my gm hated him so I stepped on a teleport trap which ported me 6 feet over a dragons egg dropping me into it shattering it right as the dragon comes walking in I cast suggestion type spell screamed mommy at the dragon and rolled nat 20 gm slammed his head into the table and told everyone to just reroll characters

That's awesome to know about the bots. I didn't even consider testing that. On a side note I noticed something else strange. Idk if it is legit or not but I just started carrying a rifle in my inventory and got 3 legendary rifle weapon drops today two Thompsons and a vampire handmade. Thinking back on it I receiver my explosive shotgun while carrying around a shotgun and I get Gatlin guns pretty often as well and usually have a couple in my inv. Not sure if weapons kept in inventory effect weapon drops but I'm going to test that next. 
---
I once saw a lv 93 deathclaw near whitespring resort. I pulled it into the pool of bots... Me and a friend jumped on a roof, and watched the deathclaw kill tons of bots. For awhile the deathclaw was just standing at the enclosures where the bots spawn from  killing one by one as they came out
---
I can vouch for PS4 being generally cool. Im an older gamer and i play with a broad  age range of friends
---
Reminds me of my first friendly
---
I joined a random team request and one of the members quickly travelled to me and often got my attention by firing around me. So we went to Flatwoods, killed Farmhands and beelined to my camp. Then we beelined to the Grafton Dam and Steel Yard and took out a bunch of muties. I ran out of stims and my partner stopped and gave me some heals, but not after he defended me when I crouched to shield myself. 
---
honestly, as long as you stick to "mood lighting" and don't have turrets you can build a massive base with lots of goodies
---
Yeah, I like this.
---
That happened to me after I took the clown hat off. I just equipped a different hat and then unequipped and it was good. 
---
Bald spot not a good look for a lady. 
---
I took the “Good Doggy” perk pretty quick. And turned out to work great for me! I find cans of dog food everywhere.
---
I'm mostly talking about the window in the dining hall where all the ghouls drop down, if they can manage to get the base in the center area I suppose they deserve to have that spot. 
---
the primary way to do duping involves peoples bases so think of a mini nuke going off inside their house 
---
You have to pick up and maintain a supply of fusion cores, you have to repair your armor, you have to leave your armor to do certain things. I dont have to do any of that. I also regularly kill people in your lvl range who are using PA i am 80 something, while they barely scratch me during the Monster Mash event in Watoga.
---
Willing to help 
---
He’s surprisingly close to my camp, yet so far if not for your post. Thanks so much for holding him! Do you need anything from him? I can help holding him too, think I’ve got everything I want from him. 
---
I think you could get another one by trading or whatever though
---
Are you on now? I have 5 keycards I think.
---
For what it's worth I check those a lot and have never ever found anything. Must not be xbox players doing this 
---
Considering that one variant of the chemistry station is a literal booze maker!
---
Its not much, but it’s honest work.meme
---
I hate power armor. It clunky, unwieldy and I hate the HUD. My damage resistance with heavy armor and grounded is pretty close to it, plus has legendary effects like bolstering and auto-stim. 
---
Ill take my chances with a Yao guai
---
I don't use them to kill them I peg a herd of enemies during the events to make sure I get credit on loot for kills then I swap to either a flamer or a gatling depending on situation unless I'm alone then I go sledge 
---
They nuke that spot (whitesprings ) because it has a lot of gouls that spawn indefinitely and people can pick up a lot of legendary items off them. It’s the best spot to nuke in the game. Every where else is a crap shot. 
---
As far as the trading thing goes I’m really not sure
---
Can you write a few english essays for me...
---
Nope, I'm okay. Thanks for the offer though!
---
My carry capacity goes down in PA and I cant use the iron fist (power fist) so I avoid it unless its nuke ‘em time
---
I love helping low level players like this. I've got an automatic handmade with the Suppressor perk that's great for softening things up, and after everyone else tags them I bust out my war drum and mop up.
---
You get the same exp and loot whether you kill something in 1 shot or simply damage it, so there's no point in being greedy.
---
If anyone on xbox needs a level 80 tour guide feel free to hit me up. 
---
Actually I believe nuking Morgantown can be viable as well because there's many ghouls just like Whitespring but different types of Flora for flux. My brother went there when someone nuked it last week and he said it was a lot of fun because it was different than doing Whitesprings. The only downside was having to run in between buildings whereas Whitespring has a lot of open space.
---
I just learned about the xp bonus from well rested, I found a map online here about level ranges for areas and stuck to it. Except for a tour to harpers ferry and watoga. I am also a sneak/sniper build with leather armor and have died a lot. I keep a set of power armor on me only for jumping down cliffs or retrieving my loot . 
---
I don't think they go by those names in this one but the effects are the same.
---
I seriously can't tell either.  It's just a blur.
---
Not with perks I currently carry 70 something fusion cores I also can now down people with my 3 star TSE shotgun or 2 shot gauss rifle
---
Okay! thanks again =)
---
It's only on pc I think. If it's on console I'm super jazzed. 
---
YOU WERE AN ACCIDENT!
---
just killing time at work.
---
Also way to prove a point.
---
Make sure you have a lots of steel scraps or apply the mod ASAP. 
---
Even wood if you're into that.
---
PHRASING!
---
Welcome to *The Whitesprings*
---
The exchange of money doesn't happen on Bethesdas servers. Trading bottlecaps is perfectly fine by Bethesda.
---
I bet a person like you think your ISP also has any rights about, for example, what you post here. Because the data never leaves Internet!!!
---
Since you are so full of your irony and diggings, I will look no further replies.
---
Nope it's communal. I dumped a bunch of gear in it by accident once and it all disappeared 
---
That would be pretty cool
---
Careful. You might catch something you can’t wash off. Hope you put a helmet on your soldier
---
As me and 30 others creep toward
---
THANK YOU!
---
I didnt realize you had to back out from looking at the cards to pick the perk! I thought picking the card was picking the special category!! Ugh! No wonder my perks are all messed up! Again! LOL
---
If anyone gets him with it and already has em .. Star burst clock or kitchen tables.. that's what I'm hunting him for. 
---
So you're saying when I rushed forward like everyone else, I essentially gave up my loot instance?
---
r/thatHappened
---
I found one leading cats. The name was Veterinarian something.
---
I know I've left mini nukes in train stations at least once. They are just dead weight to me. 
---
What exactly do we console plebs have to do to get in on this?
---
9/10 times when I kill a glowing wendigo that ISN'T at Whitesprings it skyrockets into the air/through the ceiling never to be seen again
---
Preach!  I don't expect it to be perfect, a Bethesda game wouldn't be right without glitches, but definitely annoying when I keep getting disconnected during my limited playtime and I'm just trying to farm some resources at a public workshop or I've taken my time sniping high level enemies in an area for a quest and then lose connection and have to do it all over again.  I'd pay monies for access to selectable servers, especially to make it easier to find other casual limited-time players and avoid the asshats causing server crashes with duping glitches.  If not, then the next best thing I can do is to wait for people to reverse engineer the server code and find a way to bring up private servers.
---
Incoming " Don't blame the player, blame the game" comments.
---
I noticed this about a week ago. So I just jump thru my second floor window every time to get in. Currently don’t have a door
---
Are you sure you got “Marine Shielded” instead of “BoS Shielded”?
---
I didn’t find reliable info on marine protected and shielded in searches: the unreliable info was that Marine Protected has a chance to drop from Mirelurk Queens and Marine Shielded has a chance to be rewarded by the Census Violence event (after all the others are learned) (or other cranberry bog events?).
---
Before bethesda fixed it dropping a nuke on a spawned SBQ killed her.
---
But after bethesda flagged her as nuke immune.
---
"and water"? Can't I make water anywhere?
---
They are lying to themselves.  They are, have, and continue to be the problem with the server stability.  They are literally DDoSing the servers.
---
Ok, so the use of melee weapons was an implied assumption here. Am I really missing out using no melee weapons?
---
Aww dang thanks
---

communications is hard.
---
Just drop them off at the overseer's camp in the beginning area. I drop all kinds of stuff there that I don't need and it gets picked up fast from the newer players. I don't sell any of my plans unless they are rare.
---
If they’re nuking the south eastern region it’s so that they can “summon” the Scorchbeast Queen at the prime fissure; it’s the final raid boss. 
---
I saw a 91 mythic death claw at whitesprings... two shot it with my melee build and All-Rise. I’m wondering if I’ve made the game TOO easy for myself 🤔
---
Thank you for your info!!!
---
Yesterday i did 9with my group. It is so bad i am human and i must sleep, or work.
---
Use to be where you could tag queen, drop a nuke on her, loot, and repeat. Not sure if it still works or not.
---
I’m a heavy weapons user, my off weapon is a shotgun and I repair my heavy weapons 3x more than my pump shotty. All I use is Gunsmith 5 and Luck of the Draw 3 (the repair luck perk) and it seems to proc more with my shotgun than my heavy weapons. 
---
Anyone else old enough to remember Winamp and having thousands of songs on a playlist? 
---
It always miffed me how on random it would end up playing the same 10-15 songs in rotation out of thousands of songs. 
---
It appears as though randomization technology hasn’t evolved since then. 
---
What I've taken to is building in structures most places not marked on the map are buildable there's a pretty good farm silo west of Morgantown north of that other golf course not whitesprings
---
Is this what we call duping?
---
You can use the psn app since you have a phone. I use it when other players don’t have mics. But seriously dude get a mic. I’m pretty sure all ps4 come with one when you buy it
---
A big trigger guard doesn't stop you from using a gun, but one to small would.  And honestly having a large increase to HP is already a very strong advantage, doubly so when coupled with the resistances that were mentioned.
---
Saw that on YouTube. A guy did reviews of mods in a funny voice. Pretty amusing. Did a whole bit on ‘immersive toilet paper mod’.
---
MxR Mods. Pretty funny guy. 
---
yes you can make a purifier and pump to get water anywhere but it requires a lot more resources for a lot less return and instead of taking minutes to gather 40 dirty water it takes seconds if you have a water source
---
Im not a fucking dog. I am how ever a cannibal. 
---
He's got the starburst clock and domestic kitchen table plans here
---
I'm able to hop on soon. Are we sure we can launch nukes?
---
Have you looked into 2x1 and 1x1 survival CAMPs?
---
Had the exact same today, took off all armor on the chassis, logged off and in, then it was ok, also managed to drop left arm during a queen fight today, lol :)
---
I dont know what your point is? TSE is broken atm and will one shot anything PA or Normal armor. My point is that normal armor has more defense and no maintenance needed later in the game and none of the downsides of PA, which makes it superior later on.
---
Most high level players are drowning in shit. They don't want or need your shit adding to it. Stop being so dramatic.
---
Pretty sure. Someone nuked a Whitespring kn one of my recent sessions.
---
Games are PC only, but the promotion was open to everyone.
---
Well some people out there could care less about farming and grinding and all that other stuff, and simply wanna build a base at Whitesprings and see it as time well spent. Lol happy trails fellow Dweller.
---
At a higher level and by not using turrets you can vuild some pretty big camps, and have capacity to decorate them as well.
---
i think you can only get plans for it by scrapping other ultracite laser pistols (at least that's what I've found)
---
The Mothman is my favourite crypid 
---
Second is the  Flatwoods Monster
---
I stalk and kill every bounty that pops up. It's a rule of mine to at least try even if they are way above me.
---
 I like to see if it's a trap so I creep around. Once the deed is done I whisper "I'm sorry" and throw the unhappy emote. I don't care to take the junk, I normally don't even look so I can avoid temptation.
---
about the same here, only more levels ahead of you. i've played since halfway the beta, but only now achieved level 53, witch for me who was used to play fallout 4 and binge 100 levels in a month, gotta say that this game really makes me wanna take things slowly and enjoy the game for what it is.
---
No one was talking about bottlecaps, but money.
---
So you tell me? Does Bethesda have the right to say you are allowed to use their game only when wearing a pink hat? All playing happens on their server, so you can't use that argument. Do they have any rights or authority OUTSIDE of that server? Yes or no?
---
Ps4 disconnects, blue screens, freezes all part of a normal fallout gaming session unfortunately atm 
---
Pretty much. It’s a bug. Be patient.. you’ll be happier. Just don’t lose it when the big ass bat turns into a fly pile. 
---
I would always (personally) take the raw stats.. in this case the armor pen, its just too useful
---
You sort of can, with the Sweetwater Special Blend (it's considered alcohol since you use Bourbon to make it). But yeah, I know what you mean. It'd be cool if we could make our own booze so we have a more stable supply of it.
---
You can play the game at any level you want to, but you don't tell people playing at a higher level than you what they're doing is wrong when you have an entry level understanding of their methods and motivations.
---
* Duping is part of the meta.
---
* Avoiding sub-optimal content you're going to get disconnected from because it wastes resources is also part of the meta.
---
* This game is about optimizing loops. Closing the loop faster and avoiding choices which make the loop longer is the dialectic of Fallout 76.
---
* If you want to perform well in this gear-driven game, participating in its grey market is necessary and you shouldn't complain.
---
* If you want to RP, then the grey market doesn't affect you or your gameplay and you shouldn't complain.
---
* If you insist that neither of these cases is true, but you're still complaining, then it's obvious you're lying to everyone and yourself about how bothered you are that you're not the strongest character in the game.
---
* Idealism alone will never result in a good game. At some point, you people are going to have to open your eyes and look at the game for what it is, and recognize that its players are not responsible for its state of being.
---
Would it have been to difficult for the devs to place some appropriate lore friendly warning about what level you would need to be for certain quests.
---
I don't always go googling a quest first as it kind of spoils the fun, but this final scene is pretty daft for low level players or solo ones.
---
Im assuming you mean the auto grenade launcher and not the m79, which im thqt case the only mods I do believe there are are a heavy barrel, and I think a prime reciever.
---
When I was just starting, think I was under 20, saw someone with like a 7 cap bounty or something who was also only like level 5, I shot him then he started running and I chased and killed him. Immediately felt like a jerk about it and regretted killing him. Also how I discovered you can steal peoples junk. (I only took like 3 adhesive from him left the rest) 
---
I felt uncomfortable just thinking about how you made that work. Good on you for finding a way, though 
---
I love stalking people in this game, firing 1 shot then hiding. Watching them frantically search but never find you. Following them, sometimes for 10-15 min. Always crouching when they arent moving to stay off the map. The whole point is to make my victim unnerved but rarely do I ever get to kill them. If you are on xbox and you feel like someone is watching/following you, you probably are and there is a chance it's me. Never invisible just hidden.
---
I think get a computer
---
I came across a Wise Mothman during the beta. Had no idea what was going on because I thought they hurt you. It was a nice surprise and good intro to the beats of Appalachia 
---
I got Marine Protected at Event: Surface to Air a few days ago. I think all Cranberry Bog events have a small chance of dropping it. According to other posts on Reddit, Event: Census Violence has the highest chance. I'm farming Event: Census Violence for shielded at the moment. If you are on PC and have a spare plan, look me up: IGN: jchamlin 
---
Super happy someone brought this up because if player vending isn’t setup in a way where people can check easily, this isn’t going to work well. I bump into other player bases once every blue moon!
---
Ask again in 6months to a year
---
Leader of the Pack: not only 3 legendaries to give 3 commendations, but I heard they a max level 10 creatures, so certainly one of the easiest ways
---
I mean I guess. It kinda stinks though, you can't use it in nuke zones (end game) due to radiation issues. And even outside of nuke zones, for non melee builds PA is still overall better imo due to Emergency Protocols and bloody + adrenal mutation. Far safer. Oh and its better vs ghouls in all situations. 
---
Crap, I hadn’t thought of it in those terms. If getting rid of duping and massive inventories of duped items makes the game hella stable (in general anyway) I’ll be happy.
---
I'm down if we have enough 
---
Ok
---
It aint easy until you go from two-shoting them with melee to one-shot with a tse.
---
I just bought the star burst clock from him too, try server hop if you don’t see it? If you can’t find it I can help build one in your camp. 
---
Yup it was a always a fucking shame. I honestly felt let down due to how it confirmed Bethesda didn't really give a shit anymore. Especially with how hyped the pip boy was m. This was years ago now lol
---
YES!!!  I'm with you.
---
For me, it's when she made me go to Wes Tek and kill hundreds of Super Mutants when I was severely under-powered and get all that awesome "loot" when there was very little.
---
Arm is the best limb to drop!
---
I'm not sure what stats that boosts, but the moonshine it +1 to charisma and strength and -1 to intelligence. With my melee build, I'd like to be able to brew some right before I go fight the queen. 
---
By life saving I am referring to my Excavator PA with the Medic Pump torso mod and born survivor. I heard the auto-stim armor isn't very good because of the cool down period and because it only activates once after you drop below 20% health.
---
Uhh it already does, if it did more it would.be ridiculous 
---
Dude I was saying the same thing about a week ago . No weapon should be that strong where you can 1 shot a person. 
---
But I will say I had a great pvp with another player just yesterday. I set up a little ambush spot in the mire. Another player was passing by I crouched down with my chameleon armor and sniped him (role playing Americansniper lol) he couldnt see me so I shot him a few more times. He eventually hones in on me and the battle that Insued from there was epic. No two shot explosive weapons no 1 shot melees. Just me and him  10 solid minutes of maneuvering, ducking for cover and landing great  shots, before I eventually took him down. It was epic I wash I would’ve recorded it.
---
The whole one shot kill weapons are getting boring I really hope they get rid of them
---
I'm game. When's it happening cappin? 
---
I’ll jump in. What’s GT
---
Yeah man - level 25 over here just chilling out and exploring the world... game doesn’t make you feel like you have to grind to be high level to fit in either... hang out with level 90s all the time, no issues. 
---
We seem to be the far few though... seems like everyone is 150 out there lol.
---
When every one is on and ready I guess?
---
" If you want it to be viable in a nuke zone then get pieces with the legendary effect radiation resistance and mod it with the lead mod to further increase radiation resistance. "
---
This doesn't work. Oh and PA also has hidden DR/ER mechanics, I take less in it even w/ more DR/ER in my PA. And emergency protocols make for a far far safer bloody/adrenal build.
---
I have found myself in the exact same scenario. I was dead before I could have gotten to any emote.
---
There's a gauss spawn you can farm at the antenna Northwest of um.... Uncommon(?) Caverns.  YouTube ESO rare weapons videos, it's on one of those.  I got a gauss first try there.  Scrapped it as I was low level and want a Max level one.  I'd look up the video but I'm on a phone and shitty internet right now
---
Guess he just chose a random person to pick on.
---
And you got Lucky. 777.
---
Have you played without power armor?
---
I'm going to go feed my self to a giant Hermet Crab... 
---
Some “friend”.
---
I'm not sure what stats that boosts, but the moonshine it +1 to charisma and strength and -1 to intelligence. With my melee build, I'd like to be able to brew some right before I go fight the queen.
---
But at the same time, just being able to brew some booze and be able to sell would be nice.
---
My original post was in response to someone who didn't understand why Fallout 76 has received a lot of criticism compared to Red Dead Redemption 2/Read Dead Online.  I went through the issues both games had on release and also iterated on the changes both companies have made since (e.g. fixing issues etc.)  Sure a number of issues has been addressed and for new players that's great, however most people who have played since release and a fair amount like me also played since the marketing "beta" had a terrible experience.  You can't really compare it to RDR2.
---
Fallout 76 still has a number of issues to address, as I stated when playing in single player/co-op you can have a good time if you stick to exploration/quests, however this content is limited. PvP is broken,  Workshops are not worth the effort, Event's are repetitive and boring, Nuke Zones are again boring as in most cases they are only dropped on two different areas, if your not in an organised group and have small number of players the Scorchbeast Queen can be un-killable that's if the server holds up.
---
The lusty argonian. 
---
I got mine claiming the gorge workshop. 
---
Is there some organized way to find someone with an All Rise to trade?
---
Gotcha. 
---
That’s not a friend , that’s an O’Driscoll , oh shit wrong game 
---
Same here
---
Also quick question is Fallout 76 an MMO in your eyes?
---
Was she choking? ;)
---
How  do I add you on XB1?  Do we have to be on the same server?
---
I'd also say enclosed areas as well. 
---
With a shotgun that fires explosive shit everywhere,  there's little else BUT "spray n pray"
---
Trade or buy. 
---
I’m already at site Alfa control room. No one to help?
---
I have that modded combat rifle too. It really is a great weapon to use for the .38 rounds. Once you get to a certain level your not going to be using pipe pistols. I’m certainly going to hold on to it.
---
Damn.... got deleted as I started to read it. 
---
Can't you just craft it again?
---
Looked it up anyway, skip to 5:11 for gauss.  Fatman spawn is right also.
---
You just wanted to get rid of excess weight In reality didn’t you xD
---
I've seen a 2000 Cap bounty once.  This person was holed up in a cave.  I'm certain it was a setup with someone that had no caps to begin with.  They were high level as well, so I didn't waste time or caps.  
---
I get a lot of caps because I'm constantly selling to Vendor bots.  PvP is just a waste of Caps for me.  I kill you, get 50 caps.  You kill me get 200 caps.  No thanks...sure you win.  Whatever you say.  No fun. I like Co-Op
---
Going to share this suggestion with the team. Thank you Kereedy
---
Yes, it is a simple issue (you want movable tats) that you clouded (cartoon filled). Your main point does not need the support of the clouding issue, which does nothing to support it.
---
Gross
---
You have them in the launcher. If your on console you need to get to a PC.
---
The crafting requires the sword itself. It was only to increase the level of the items.
---
Nope, just my house with a junk node.
---
We need that sweet Sweet GT
---
Oh right. Its just my username.
---
Did y'all end up killing J47? I noticed he was one of the zombies in the last wave. At least his wait has finally ended.
---
If it was on PC you may want or need to turn down your graphical settings before trying the scorched beast queen fight again. I've had similar issues, knocked shadow quality down a notch and it got a lot better in huge fights. 
---
I was wondering why those 100+ level guys were there with me.... Good to know
---
I am as sure as I can reasonably be that the axe vanished. I know I did not vendor it, because I had it after my last vendor visit. I did not drop it, because I don't drop things very often, and I check the bags out of habit after I almost dropped a good weapon.
---
Its possible my memory has failed me, and I did do something unusual for me, but unlikely in this case.
---
This is why we must nuke them repeatedly until the message is heard.
---
I think they removed it, for whatever reason.
---
Duper? 
---
Your profile is set to offline, last seen 19 days ago. Mines StatesideLlama if you will send me an invite. 
---
I think if someone had a 50+ cap bounty on them, they're probably deliberately trouble making.
---
Fair punishment will be to take their screws and springs, and leave the rest.....
---
Well you dont have all the annoying part of using a PA when you're not using one so yeah, it's totally worth it.
---
Im 3 years old. Want to play? 
---
It's always nice to have someone higher level dropping a few legendaries they don't want off in a brown bag for you.
---
PC.  The team matchmaking stuff is a huge mess.  If two of us are in a party, a third can't seem to join without us all going back to the main menu.  And sometimes we have to restart the game completely.  Other times, you can't even see the friends list at all.
---
We've had a few games where the game switches party leader on its own for whatever reason.  The networking is super buggy.  You should let the guys working on ESO re-do it.
---
Ill invite you. And I always appear offline.
---
*weird flex, but ok.*
---
Can you change your status to appear online?
---
&gt; Am I the only one?
---
Yes, you are a special flower
---
He has dif stuff for each person though. I have been having an issue since the last official patch which causes me to freeze when he or responder bot are near me. 
---
Yeah ill do that
---
One of my characters is Billy Mays so, if I was able to display his name it’d be wonderful
---
From a garbage book written by thieves who weren't creative enough to create their own religion without stealing from others and killed anyone who disagreed with it. 
---
And it's Jonny, not Johnny.
---
Don't need history lessons on biblical bullshit but thanks.
---
The Starlet Sniper is from the cover of one of the Astoundingly Awesome Tales books in Fallout 4.
---
Nope. I really want this feature to show off my nuka cola quantum collection.
---
You need to pick your friends better. 
---
I mean either way its a problem. I think whitesprings in general shouldn't be able to be built on. 
---
Yup. 
---
In terms of killing power, that AGL with Anti armor is way better. I also prefer crafting ammo for it as it doesn’t require screws - missiles do.
---
Missiles are nice (with the target computer) to hit precisely at long range. 
---
Damn dupers.
---
I understand completely 
---
Idk why you’re being downvoted. It’s true. 
---
You wouldn't be able to tell that someone's duping unless you could actually see everyone in the server simultaneously.  You can dupe in some corner of the map that nobody pays attention to.  You could dupe behind whitesprings if its not being nuked if you wanted to.  
---
It won’t matter what I say. I have my reasons. 
---
I kind of get it because it makes it easier to find people if you tend to randomly form teams for shorter adventures. I can see the advantage of both sides. 
---
Unique names for every character in the game, with the ability to find a user name by their character name, would be a good compromise. 
---
If anyone was allowed to be "Bob" for example (with no way to trace it to a unique user name) it would be tougher to find people and griefers would be able to use it as a sort of disguise.
---
Popular opinions: 
---
* The game has a bustling white market
---
* Beth can do character/item resets
---
* Punish players for playing
---
Correct opinions: 
---

Your username is the direct opposite of this post. I love it.

Fallout 1, 2, &amp; Tactics are all really old games.  You should have no problems playing them on a decade old laptop.  So any Windows computer you have laying around should work.  I'd be more worried about the Bethesda Launcher being able to run than the games on anything too old.
---
I mean, it’s a game. Who are you to dictate how someone plays? That’s selfish in its own way. 
---
Do you think they’ll add a feature like this in the future?
---
*hang your head in shame.
---
Seriously? Runescape graphics. Get the fuck outta here mother fucker.
---
WELL SAID

Is he an actual friend or somebody you met online. Sounds like a real scumbag
---
I'll be there soon ran out of ammo so farming some steel real quick
---
WHAT oh no...
---
I saw it in the list and I thought I was safe to sell it and the Voice of Set and make higher level ones later on when I felt like it.
---
What is the preferred spot to dump things in? I will do this daily on xb1 if someone gives a good chest to loot that early players come across 
---
I'm only a level 13 but when I was a 6ish or so I was wandering through the woods at night near the vault. I got a weird feeling so I tapped the vats button a bunch of times to no avail. I took out my scoped hunting rifle and did a 360 scan. To my direct rear about a hundred yards away I see two bright red eyes staring directly at me. Nearly shit myself. After I scoped in it turned out to be a level 35 mothman just standing completely still and staring at me. Creepy af. Didn't know what it was. So after debating for 5 minutes or so I took a shot at it and it vanished in a cloud of black dust. Thought that was really odd but after reading these posts I guess I can count myself really lucky. The mothman spared my lowly hide.
---
I bought the plans from him, you can come trade with me if you want
---
Alright im getting on now and will invite everyone and if I have the right ammo then Ill give you it.
---
Ending hold in 10 minutes

Workshop defenses- I’ve gotten it maybe 3-4 times total. Keep giving it away to random players if they’re nice :)
---

I feel like the first overseers chest is the best place because new players have to go there and they’re guaranteed to check that chest.
---
How dare this guy use the weapons he has to find his own enjoyment of the game instead of worrying about making sure everyone else has fun. How dare he I say!!
---
It seems you must have one to craft one.  
---
I sang that song in choir as well! It would be a fun duet as we traverse the wastes.

I think it's a secondary wheel.

Scroll through your current ones, and it should appear as a second tier when you select the appropriate category one.
---
Only if you have it actively selected in atomic shop though iirc.

I heard you have to press reload twice
---
It's all good thanks I wont be long
---
But they aren't?  You are attacking a ghost.  Only a small percentage of youtubers have shown themselves do this, and that's what their channels are usually about.  Look at the linked channel, half of his FO76 vids are "how to do x glitch".  
---
Or "I dropped some stuff for you, here"
---
LOL.  I got that.  Not fun.
---
I feel like this is a good chunk of people who are complaining about the game. The complainers are also the ones that are just trying to get the best of everything and power level. The ones that seem to be enjoying it are exploring. I mean it's not a perfect assumption as people have fun in different ways, but that's the trend I'm noticing.
---
Anyway, if you ever feel like slowly exploring you can message me. I play on PC and I'm somewhere around level 40 and melee.

Try rebuilding the database. I do it practically every week and I get extremely few disconnects since I started doing it so often. It's a pain in the ass to do constantly but it definitely helps me with disconnect and CE errors.

I have an autolauncher with 50% armor ignore and 50% limb damage, pretty good combo. It's also for sale on Xbox.

Hard to say. There is a massive request roundup mega thread on here that lists all the request in one handy list.

They’ve been very quiet since the last patch.

Legally speaking if it is in the terms of service it doesn't matter what any of us think. They agreed to a contract and then broke it and thus should face the consequences.

I swear on me mum, I saw the Flatwoods monster one/two-shot a Scorchbeast in Cranbog.

Ho, great... the game crashed when I was protecting the launch prep bots.

Now I’m back in a new server and have to clear site Alfa all over again. 
---
That why I don’t like to do this alone!
---
I guess I’ll do it tomorrow... 
---
:( 
---
Well GTA has a thriving Sharkcard business as well as a way to make in game cash. I think because they so generous allows it to become thriving. Bottom line you going to get people that will pay those that will never. I agree, I get why it might be like this but isn't to their benefit and will show people how greedy they are.
---
The guass rifle is what deals ballistic damage. Not the Tesla rifle. The Tesla rifle deals energy damage. The plus to the Tesla rifle is that it's very accurate at targeting the weak spots of groups of enemies. Just fire at the ground towards an enemy rather than actually at the enemy. You'll hit them more accurately because it arcs and destroys them.

I’ll help farm anytime I’m on usually
---
I rush to the highest level and then start. In my Emerson, I left the vault in top shape, ready to rebuild. I didn't even finish the main story till lv 130, or the mistress of mysteries till 145.
---
I'm still actively hunting sets and acquiring specific weapons, from the game, not the super market.
---
I'm not done by a damn mile.
---
I think I read your post yesterday and it worked, thanks
---
No problem. This is what my self sufficient camp looks like. It has a junk extractor, 2 purifiers, and a bunch of food stuff. And I claim workshops for other stuff like ammo and junk and I'm gonna need to stock up on some copper too. 
---

Its because the “vault tec” beds they give you are just the shitty looking normal bed. Funny enough the actual vault tec bed is labelled something completely different.
---
My instigating explosive black powder rifle and full sneak/rifleman build with sneaky arnor makes short work of the bad guys too. Most recent was a lvl213 with a 350 cap bounty (no way that was an accident). One shot ...
---
Someone from a completely other country who I befriended during the beta. Kinda crazy to have it turn out like that. 
---
What would help is a special bin marker or area that indicates helper items.  I don’t play with sound sometimes so can’t hear what others say.
---
Pain train is only designed for getting you killed in enclave bunker
---
Yes, I do. It's completely open so people can feel free to use it, plus it nice to look up at the stars at night.
---
Why were they in the beta then? 
---
How do you know it was duped? Or are you just assuming it was because it's explosive?
---
its rng, any spawn where a magazine would spawn
---
I carry a baseball bat or board with me, currently at lvl 55.
---
Because going back into the forest can be tedious using a 50cal machine gun on lvl 1-6 scorched.
---
And it's a bit of fun to occasionally knock a few melons off!
---
Hmm I wonder if I was helping you for a bit. I also spawned into the nuke zone in xo1 and helped a Lvl 36 dude kill a bunch of glowing all the way along the back houses until we got to the train station. I was really just trying to get out to scrap but I didn't want him to lose out on exp. 
---
That’s what I like too!
---
Yeah I wouldn’t hold my breath. Bethesda pretty much already gave up on the game and it’s bleeding active player counts every week. 
---
Me and my buds had a similar experience! We wanted to claim a workshop. Grafton steel yard I believe it was. It was owned by a guy that had 3 or 4 other workshops across the map. We got about half way through claiming when 4 high level players and one low level showed up. An epic battle ensued. The down side was the low level player was passive, just standing there blocking our capture. They also built tons of missile turrets while we were there. After a while, we had run out of stims and literally had no chance to progress the claim because of the passive player so we retreated back to our base. 
---
Up until this point our K/D was pretty even. We hadn't lost or gained much caps. But they decided to teach us a lesson I guess(lol). They followed us back to our turf. All doors locked, turrets galore, multiple beds for free heals. They racked up bounties and we collected them one after the other. A scorched beast showed up and starts destroying them as well as our base. They unloaded everything they had. Nuka grenades, mini nukes, and even an orbital strike. In the end, our base was in shambles. We made the heart emote and left the servers almost 1k caps richer each. We technically lost in that situation but we also killed more then we died and made tons of money.
---
Victory came at a heavy cost for them and defeat never felt so sweet :)
---
Is that still a thing? I mean I remember it being big back in the early Halo/cod days, and I guess is interpret it like that if they do it after killing you, but rapidly crouching is also pretty much universal Minecraft for "Hi! We're friends now!" I think if someone did that after attaching me one time, I'd probably take it as a "oh shit, sorry!"
---
No pictures?
---
I'd  really appreciate a "I come bearing gifts!" Emote.
---
I have a semi-open camp. It’s nice. 
---
I wanna be a cat, because somehow they are immune to nuclear apocalypse.
---
And I'd be super cute.
---
OK, you guys need to hurry up and fix the pvp server thing, because I'm so tired of getting constantly attacked by sissies who run around killing players who are 1/4 their level, what is the fun/challenge in that? Something is wrong with you if you are doing that. You have issues and should find a hobby. But I'm not playing it anymore until you fix it. The game is not fun like this. 
---
Unless you're carrying 100 springs and screws. Then you're playing with fire...
---
Hey mate thanks for tagging. For this one the best approach is to submit a support ticket detailing what happened [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Youtubers aren't the smartest bunch to be fair 
---
The second I can get on ! What name do I add ?
---
I'm not interested, too lazy, don't want to be forced for specific functions, don't want others to gain an advantange, don't want them wasting time on it whilst other things need addressing, don't want them to potential leave people out who might not have a smartphone that supports the app. I can think of more reasons. 
---
Minnesota also uses ope
---
It's funny cause I always need rubber and steel these days. Also I'm sure ballistic fiber is probably not in a loot bag. Anyway, I don't do it for loot. 
---
This was the case in Fallout 4. It would trigger outside at night and always indoors.
---
I still bulk, I like how neat it stacks things, main reason not to build I believe is it couldn't potentially destroy your mods you haven't used and it doesn't tell you it's scrapping them even if you carry them on you or you put them on your stash. Best way is to try safely store them somewhere but they is probably too tedious.
---
Personally I bulk as I like as most items are neatly ordered and I just give all my mods to my 2nd character on a 2nd xbox, so relatively easy or just don't buy mods until you ready to use them.
---
I agree dupers should be punished, but as of right now. No way to know 
---
So there's an auto blueprint thing that happens if you move your CAMP. It's not perfect as sometimes it has issues being placed (hence, I think, why so many camps are built on only one foundation tile). 
---
Your entire structure that is connected and everything in it will show up as a big blue blob at the top of your Stored tab.
---
I move my camp quite a bit and this generally works. It has a hard time with the small metal letters, and sometimes my rugs are floating about 6 inches off the floor, but that's how I do it.
---
Anything not connected to or sitting on a structure you'll unfortunately have to re-place.
---
You might take some notes before you move it if there's anything really complicated you did and you need to fix it.
---
I do wish we could just scoot the CAMP box to move our boundary a little bit without destroying the camp (maybe it would just store anything that goes off the edges). 
---
Same pb here :(
---
On my excavation Pa, the helmet is always missing when i log in... 
---
Won't lie I was super tempted to take a dive into the vats at westek research lol 
---
its the m79. my bad, forgot there was more than 1 grenade launcher
---
Thank you for this mate
---
it's a m79, sorry. my bad that i didnt specify
---
Or Bethesda should fix known issues affecting their game... I know it's hard with the modding community 
---
That's not the issue. Previously bulking actually made everything heavier. I need to know what the case is now.
---
Thankyou. I'll take your advice. Worst case I sink more hours into a new home lol
---
My username is zomburger57 and I'd love to play with you
---
That doesnt make it a juke box now does it? 
---
I don’t get this mentality. If it’s fun for them then who are you to dictate that they should have less fun so someone else can have their fun? It’s a *game*. 
---
Yes add @mannysandov 
---
I have seen jukebox’s that play newer music irl
---
It's called pacifist mode
---
Will take one tomorrow if you like. It’s 4am here haha.
---
The problem with cap farming is you tube vids have all the cap stashes covered so they are always gone and you can only get a max of 1000 caps a day from vendors
---
Hey if there’s room you can inv Gator Vz. Level 108
---
Lol It was 2 launchers and 4 laser turrets tyvm...I was that asshole at one point. I also left my door open and had a switch inside to turn the guns off. 
---
I usually turned them off myself before I'd leave 
---
I am level 27.  After progressing through the first few quests of the game, I just started wandering around the edge of the map to find the map points that I would come across.  I dont get to play but maybe once a week due to my work schedule but I finally made it back to where I started.  Did I get my butt handed to me at times, yes indeed.  But, I had fun to see the sights without running from point A to B to C and missing out on the work that the devs put into the scenery. 
---
Okay
---
Lol haven’t seen this one, Seems like Bethesda are continuously adding new content in the form of bugs tho
---
And I 100% agree on that.
---
I was in the middle of an enclave event with three other people. Accidentally hit a guy and we both kept going, so I thought it was no big deal. Event ended and I started leaving the area. He shot me in the back of the head as I walked away. Didn’t even take my loot. Just shot me and continued on his way. 
---
Doubt that is true but ok since it uses plasltic, if anything everything is lighter. People don't do it because it is a waste of time and not worth the effort unless you selling.
---
Sure
---
There are bounty hunters for asses like that
---
I found my second All Rise at the Watoga train station. Someone must have sold it. There are non-melee builds and those with better 3* legendary weapons that will sell of theirs. Just look for someone wanting to sell, or make a wanted post on one of the trading subs or Discord channels.
---
I would not be highly excited about the vending machines. Even if they implment them well, I fear a lot of people would just place some crap for high prices on sale on them.
---
Suppose they could be useful. I would hope so. But not really expecting that to happen unfortunately. It would be fun and useful to dump ammo for them so to sell it and buy other kind of ammo from other players. 
---
Considering how poorly the trading interface is currently set up, it would be way far out to think those vending machines could be set up to trade items for items.
---
Same as the one on this account, Kaijudospartan. I hope you got caps, they cost about 500 in total
---
yea i'm haven't clinically tested it either just thought i'd mention it since you seemed to be "testing" the game
---
I'll have to read your post, i use a assassins 2 star and seem to run into the HP refilling bug less than other weapons, wondering if that's related to what you posted or not.
---
Yeah that would be great 
---
I got killed by a legendary glowing ant today, so there's that. 
---
Impossible unless you want to get the cyber police to come after you
---
Game is most fun when you are low level with crappy weapons trying to kill a high level mob.  Only wish they have different story line branches.  Everything is linear.
---
I wanted to jump in but there is a terminal that tells you they aren't active anymore.
---
Logically the accuracy would be greater because there would be two projectiles flying in a certian direction rather than one. But factually i have no clue
---
Random place you find that people have chosen to die, example there’s a couple on top of one of the still sites sitting in airplane seats with bottles around them. I like to think they enjoyed those last few drinks.
---
I've been killed by Cars a lot and didn't know about "Rule One" of fallout games
---
sorry if that wasn't clear? My guns weren't good enough to destroy cars fast for like 100 levels maybe i'm just shit and that's not common
---
Totes adorbs.
---
You can make a new character and do the quest again I believe. Then transfer it via a friend.
---
I agree. The skeleton in a bath of soap had me thinking for a while haha
---
It was in fallout 4 though?
---
im already built in that area and have a trading post set up, so you can add AgentEagleStorm to the list.
---
Hmm. That’s interesting idea.  
---
Not being able to craft quest rewards is next level retardation by Bethesda. But im not suprised anymore.
---
I cant wait for TES 6 to suck and be set in skyrim again for no reason
---
With 16 times the detail. 
---
Googles can you join my game GT is mrdiamond01 so we can see where your house is
---
Where can I find magazines? Are they a recurring spawn?
---
Lasers dont have mass so they shouldnt move objects or even have recoil at all
---
More or less I was referring to destiny 1 
---
You build your camp where the cat is and live with it there but you can't tame it or take it with you when you move your camp.
---
Maybe do it how an MMORPG should do it, and add our character names with our screen names in hyphens either beside or above our chosen character names.
---
Please give madders the ability to make your game actually good
---
How about an "hold on / one second" emote
---
I don't think we're playing the same game? I plop down a water purifier in the dirt, and purified water appears pretty quickly. No pump, no dirty water.
---
I never use grenades but I saw a perk Fire in the Hole in Perception that lets you see the arc of the throw. It looks interesting.
---
I know what you mean. The first time I wandered into the Mire I got fucking wrecked by a glowing hermit crab. Now I can 1 shot him. It kind of ruins the magic of those epic enemies when you can destroy them in 1 or 2 hits. 
---
I laugh at Old Man Mose because it uh...doesn’t sound like she’s saying buck-buck-bucket. Close, but not quite. 
---
I didn’t drop a frame during the fight as far as I could tell. I could move but other players and the sbq were frozen in place because of the server lag
---
Glassed Cavern has loads, can also just pick up some at fissure sites.
---
Yes i agree that running around with that amount of 'valuable' junk could end in disappointment, but I honestly believe that high level players aren't targetting lower levels on the off-chance that they're running around with an inventory of useful gear.
---
I stand by my original assertation that high level players are not slaughtering newbies for hundreds of springs and screws ... it just isn't worth the effort when you can farm locations for them.
---
Disclaimer: I'm on PC and only ever had one person attack me from nowhere in 100+ hours.
---
Perhaps
---
There's a nuclear waste disposal site directly north of the Whitesprings Resort art on the map. I always find a magazine and a legendary super mutant surrounded by his buddies with super sledges crammed into there. I assume the (phile) perk related to magazines would help, too. Audio cues and what not.
---
Somebody just got a recipe for a stimpack and lever action.
---
For me it happens specifically when I use vats to target a mob at someone else's workshop.  If the mob moves behind a workshop item, I end up shooting that.  Ill have to retest and see whats up.  Could have been buggy?
---
Perhaps what?
---
May I ask what the downsides have been? I've been wanting to do this and make a basketball court, but I don't want it getting torn apart by random enemies my turrets won't pick up.
---
It might not help in an chaotic environment like this but I think the "victim" should have the power to lift an bounty if they know it was just an accident.

Idk man, I found a beer hat other places, too.
---
There's no limit. I picked one up on my 100+ character a few weeks ago. I still have it, but I'm on Xbox
---
Same. I do peck at the quests, but the thing I wanna work on isn't related to leveling (outside of trying to get level 3 hacking). I wanna make an arcade in my camp using terminals and holotape games. XD
---
do you remember where at?
---
It also opens up space in your stash box if you bulk. I bulk everything to save space and to sell if I have too much. 
---
&gt;you asked me to look things up and I did.
---
I told you to look up hypocrite, opportunists and p2w. not market.
---
&gt;You're a hypocrite. [...] but then don't follow your own views on it.
---
submitting doesn't make one a hypocrite. it means I have no option but to conform.
---
&gt;from an account that's been sat here for a year got barely any posistive feedback per days spent.
---
thankfully that means squat unless you actually take reddit serious.
---
&gt;Trading in game items for real world cash is illegal and against Bethesdas Terms of Service.
---
haven't stopped other games.
---
&gt;Your a hypocrite for by NOT using real world money for your purchases and sales on the game.
---
who says I don't? not saying that I do, but I wouldn't advertise it as it gets you banned from both the bazaar and market. I do accept caps though because, like I said, I have to conform.
---
&gt;Paying to Win is the act of spending Real World Money to purchase an item that will give you an advantage
---
that is unobtainable in-game otherwise. that is p2w. if the item is obtainable in-game without paying for it, then it's p2unlock or something along those lines.
---
&gt;An opportunist takes IMMEDIATE advantage of a situation. Posting on a subreddit and waiting for a response is not IMMEDIATE.
---
you're arguing time frames now. so if the window is anything shorter than instantaneous, then you're not an opportunist?
---
do you even hear yourself? just how silly that sounds?
---
&gt;I know your just here to argue because you asked for definitions and then denied them.
---
I asked you to read up on the definition of hypocrite, opportunist and p2w, and clearly you still don't understand them. I don't really know what to do at this point, when you're literally arguing against semantics.
---
&gt;I'm guessing with your interaction and the posts you have posted you're just another fly-by player whose salty over something. I mean questions about how explosives work and that your vats doesn't work as intended and a few more trade posts doesn't scream real player.
---
but caring about karma does? because to me, digging through post histories makes you meme.
---
now I'm picturing you with your mouth wide-open and drinking soy-based products while circlejerking in your Tumblr.
---
&gt;If your DUMB enough to spend YOUR cash on an in game item for a game you have ALREADY paid for
---
you kinda proved my point there, it's not p2w.
---
&gt;If you think that this game and its player base can sustain a system that charges $20 for a single weapon then you are deluded.
---
I did say $20 was way too steep.
---
&gt;It's fallout 76 it isn't like the mmos you like referencing. Learn that's it's a different game. Understand that the premise of a real world market would not hold on a game like this with all the duping and glitches.
---
agreed. there shouldn't be a market at all, caps or otherwise. which means duping is irrelevant.
---
&gt;And for the love of god look in a dictionary yourself before you jump up trying to be yet another keyboard warrior who talks big with no backup and grow a pair of balls to actually make sure your following through with what your saying before you come at someone else.
---
you still don't understand what hypocrite means. I have to willingly partake in behavior I condemn- and enjoy it.
---
just because I use the bazaar doesn't mean it's my preferred way. I guess if you don't like Trump you should up and go, huh? because the majority voted for him?
---
clearly that means he's my preffered candidate as well. that's how stupid you sound.
---
&gt;You have yet to purchase a gun for real money, you do not sell your guns for real money.
---
says who?
---
not admitting to anything tho.
---
&gt;You ask for "man child" currency when you trade, don't attempt to look down your nose at others for doing the same.
---
when in Rome. I mean, Reddit.
---
who fucking cares about karma? are you really this cringeworthy?
---
and yeah, I'm getting downboated in a hivemind sub where dissent opinions are silenced. who'd have guessed!
---
thankfully neither you nor I have the power to dictate what will happen to this game. not even Bethesda does. if people want a real market, it'll happen. otherwise it'll just die in obscurity.
---
You can’t become wanted in events. 
---
So I got bored today and terrorized a level 11 and a 17 for a little bit. 
---
I saw a wanted person on the map, quickly fast traveled to nearest location and when I come up on him I find out he's a lvl 11 in a random camp (wasn't his) so what do I do? I smash him right in the back of the head of course! And so now feeling my inner raider come out I proceed to demolish the whole camp, which like I said didn't even belong the guys who were in it.
---
I finish my work there and walked over to the nearby train station to find the guy respond well turns out he chose to seek revenge, probably accidentally, but nonetheless I'm a raider now, "so why not kill him?" I asked myself as I gloriously exploded him with my quad exploding double barrel. 
---
Now the lvl 17 decided to take a pop at me and I unceremoniously slaughtered him as well. Again revenge is seeked. So I wait in the train station as the level 17 comes back for his loot I explode him one more time. At this point I have a 380 cap bounty which I expected someone to come hunting for, but sadly no takers. The two guys I've been terrorizing start messaging me asking why I was picking on them, apologize for being bored , basically in the wrong place at the wrong time, gave the lvl 17 a bunch of adhesive, wood, springs, gears, and screws to make up for the harassment. Kinda feel bad as the lvl 11 decided to get off and play COD.
---
Moral of the story, absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Unfortunately not, just that it wasn't from a vendor, because I wouldn't have purchased it
---
Oops! *I didn’t know it was loaded* 
---
I have nuka tapper
---
I had this occur aswell unyelding and bloodied used to give my pole hook 1050dmg after patch I fast traveled and cloudkit get it over 525. 
---
I don't blame the clown for being a prick honestly, the fault really falls on Bethesda on how the loot system works...
---
The musicians would come out after every pvp kill
---
My bad! At the time I didn’t realize the tactical and assault helmets were two different things.
---
It always really sucks. I'm sorry if you end up having to do that. If it's any consolation, despite how it initially feels when rebuilding, I usually find that I end up liking my rebuilt camp even more. 😊
---
Didn't read, after reading other posts I don't care to allow you to defend yourself. All that effort and no outcome. 
---
currently at work, but we are also private messaging. im just north of lake Eloise
---
You can add me too. I’m just a lowly level 15 but I’m down to play. PSN Snausages81. I should be on this weekend. 
---
Send another invite plz
---
Why settle for just one cat when you can have 4? For cats lovers or cat meat lovers. 
---

---
Looking for the blue billboard up on the cliff.. you can build there but don't build too close or CAMP hurts the cats when it spawns in.
---
Just wanted to say i’ve been doing this since you posted this and still got drills of 3 stars.
---
alright.
---
I have the caps !
---
In that case mods are long barrel and extended stock, and possibly a prime reciever.
---
Sorta related, came up on a bunch of dead super mutants surrounded by live scorched wanderers. Way to sell the threat of the new enemies, lol.
---
Pvp is part of the game... accept it or be killed by people who do.
---
Awesome! I’ll add you shortly :) 
---
I'm totally a "stop and smell the digital roses" kind of player.  I never level quickly in any game I play.
---
I wish you could tell the whitespring janitorial staff you’re sorry when you accidentally hit one of them with your sledge or a grenade..
---
Never
---
Thanks for replying!! I’ll add you soon :) 
---
so you don’t actually know lol
---
Heart emote always come off as sarcastic in those situations lol.
---
Yeah, every time I’m low on stimpaks and radaway I stop back by the vault and over seers camp to take them for myself
---
You're right. How do i know if a two shot explosive legendary shotgun that can destroy structures in one shot and cut through xo1 power armour like its raider armour is a duplicate?
---
My first ever nuke I nuked my CAMP. I just wanted to gather Violet Flux, and also wanted to see what would happen. Obviously it destroyed by CAMP. I liked the look of it so when repairing I left some of the walls destroyed.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/j2ilLBc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/j2ilLBc.jpg)
---
Have told the team about this too
---
That terminal text at the end. I'm dying 😂
---
so you're conceding? ok, cool.
---
it's not like you had any valid arguments, anyhow.
---
personally? hell no.
---
I like the little flat spot north of Morgantown station, but I had the same problem with scorched and super mutants lol
---
I trust you more than myself. I’m usually baked when I play. 😂
---
Maybe bethesda could just patch their fucking game properly
---
Yeah I sold mine because I thought it was trash since I finished the quest at an early level. Little did I know you had to keep it to remake them at higher levels. Kinda stupid if you ask me.
---
See but why is he a prick for using his weapon to kill things as intended? How is it less selfish of other players to want someone else to curb their fun so they can get more loot? I use one handed melee so one shotting shit isn’t really an issue for me but I’m not gonna sit there in a video game and be upset at other people not playing how I want them to play. I just move on. 
---
I've been getting my money's worth from them. I show up to base and get frequent attacks by mirelurks and other meaty creatures. I just chill inside and take a nap then go out and collect the meat for fertilizer, lol.
---
Hey mate, could you lodge a support ticket for this issue? It would ensure that the support team is aware of it [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
I don't even have one (not very lucky I guess!), but it's annoying no matter what weapon you're using because of how the ragdoll physics work (or don't) and how loot/corpse interaction work (or doesn't).
---
Let them have their fun. Also I'm sure the x version isnt much different than the PC version at ultra, besides some higher frames and ultrawide
---
Electric powerfist, and no, not the air mutation.
---
I just looted an instigating exploding black powder rifle. Looks like I saved a few bucks. Go me !
---
One shotted a lvl91 glowing deathclaw, but it's sloooooow to reload so definitely a one-shot or switch weapon.
---
Same one
---
Damn that sucks but thanks for clearing it up.
---
Out of curiosity, are you still able to do this? I missed all the press releases until seeing this post.
---
Uh, are you implying I staged it or them? And even then what would be staged?
---
I never said I know it’s staged. I said I think it’s staged.
---
One of the reasons I won’t say why is because I don’t want to give the OP insight into why it comes across as fake.
---
But posts like this seem like the newest wave of attacks on the game. Every week or so there’s a whole new crop of “issues” that often have no evidence. 
---
It would be easy to have friends burn down your camp and then take this picture and make all these claims.
---
I'm on Xbox. Thanks for the offer. It's always nice to help other players. I reckon I'll give it ago and if it's too hard I'll just come back at a higher level.
---
I had a legendary level 15 handmade it took forever to give away. The worst is when they run off while you're dropping stuff. Keep trying to get in front of them, drop....and they're gone.
---
No I never had an argument. I had facts. Now off you pop. 
---
Conceding I don't compete with the slower people. I prefer intellectuals 
---
I'll buy your 2 shot gatling
---
I am flabbergasted. This cannot be the way its suppose to work. I,'ve spent hours (as I'm sure the rest of you had) gathering those mods to only have them scrapped, is almost "stop playing this game" infuriating.
---
If you keep supporting shitty companies like bethesda who release buggy, shit games &amp; you pay for the game and do free testing, free marketing for the company you have a brain problem. Seriously, see a doctor. 
---
Drop into my game I guess, invite keeps crashing or I can join yours. What's your GT? 
---
I believe so cause I have a two shot pump shotty that I have to be point blank to hit in vats and do good dmg
---
Ok gamer tag is D1PD1P
---
Or they open up a area inside whitespring, with room for 24 vendors. (1 per player on server, and they can not die)
---
It was just me vs the ferals. I was wondering after I got started If there was a filter on what you dropped if you died. 
---
Alrighty, Ill take care of it. Thanks.
---
Pacifist Mode my man
---
what platform are you on? I can give you mine from an alt toon that will not use it 
---
DCI is a sad little patch with one lonely ass DC. SAD. Make DCI great again!
---
D1PD1P
---
Hshahaha
---
Yes I am saying exactly that. 
---
Or he could possibly have harvested it using green thumb every time a nuke was dropped. Why automatically assume he was a super?
---
My buddy and I did. We couldnt stop laughing and being salty though the whole experience.
---
That's no good. I didn't even know drills could be legendary. I'm sure they would sell for a lot on bazzar
---
Yes, I am loving the experience, exploring, dying, getting in and out of trouble, and most of all hunting down recipes and building my camp.
---
I wonder if the US president actually went there in-universe.
---
Honestly it needs to be level gated.
---
Sounds like a great place to nuke. Want to try Solomon's Pond to check out what happens to the behemoth. 
---
I use it all the time during cap stash runs. It one shots anything below level 22. I’ll usually run the Morgantown cap stash run then turn around and pain train the 30 ghouls that aggroed me in one shot. It’s pretty funny and not really a bad farm for junk.
---
Glad to have helped.
---
After having followed up on this rumour with extensive testing in multiple locations, "control" is too strong a word....
---
I just came by to say our usernames are very similar, and I was confused for a moment. 
---
you create the pump to get dirty water to turn into boiled for food and drink recipes (corn soup, muttfruit juice, etc)
---
the purifier you place on the ground takes 8power and only holds 2 purified max at a time, the medium one you place in water uses 4 energy and can hold 3 max purified at a time
---
I found it once, it was on a protectron vendor for 240 caps, but it is one of the those random spawning ones for the responders.
---
&gt;I had facts
---
well, yeah. you did look up stuff on the saurus like I told you to. you just ignored all of it, I guess.
---
Yeah it sucks I had somebody burn me for one of my legendaries. He said he accidently scraped it at the workbench. Guess he thought I didn’t know you cant scrap legendaries. Anyway I just deleted em and moved on. You should do the same there’s some pretty cool people in this community
---
Congrats, you have re-founded the Mafia
---
haha
---
Thank you so much for this. I have a weird extra stair set used to make my stairwell. The post trick should help me. Time to scrap my house for the umpteenth time. 
---
What reason would I have to destroy my own base? You can literally trace my post history that Ive played since launch and you think Im suddenly trying to stage some bullshit? What the fuck man? Ive actively worked the market, provided feedback, and keep playing through all of it. Ill tell you, it won't be the game that ends up driving me away, it'll be people in the community like you.
---
Same here. 300 hours about level 100 😲 
---
Was it a trailer in a shed in a rundown town? If so that's the quest guy, and when I found him he was bugged and had DOZENS of the cards. Its on the edge of the bog and the mire.
---
Not sure what that entails but sure thank you
---
Go to the mansion of mysteries and I think you can make another
---
I recently lost two friends as well. I had bought him a two shot explosive .50 cal for Christmas. Weeks beforehand anyway. Me and his other friends have been playing together almost every day out of the last month. Then while the three of us at the time were having a great time they kicked me from the party, kicked me from the team, and then completely wrecked my camp. I kept trying to fight back and got some kills back but it was 2-1. 300 Caps lost because of dieing to them and then having to buy the supplies off someone to rebuild it all. It honestly still bugs me from how a great time switched all of a sudden to that. 
---
There are pvp servers coming next update
---
My buddy is getting the game soon and I've been stocking decent weapons, armor, essential plans for camp, and a shit ton of canned foods and meds for when he exists the vault.
---
We're here to help :)
---
My mum is the person who got me into computer gaming! It started with Sim City, then it was The Sims! Then she helped me buy the parts to build my own computer. If my mum didn't allow me to continue my love of gaming, I never would have met my now husband, as she got me into World of Warcraft too where I ultimately met him!
---
Kinda depends. Sometimes I can go for hours without issues, sometimes I can’t go an hour. Word around the wastelands is it’s duping douchebags. 
---
We have google and you’re still too lazy to have looked up a damn thing yourself OR actually play the game to see of anything has changed. Instead you have to be spoonfed like a damn child.
---
And your ability cherry pick what I said is impressive!
---
1.) They didn’t specify what method they were patching idiot, how do you know they failed? Even if it wasn’t the most popular method, if they had a fix for A method there’s no reason not to push it and shows the issue isn’t being ignored.
---
You’re the one claiming they said duping period, I said “a method”, trying to put words in my mouth is pathetic.
---
2.) They fixed crashing UPON EXITING on PC, not every form of crashing. If anyone still has that issue then it’s a reason more specific to them and could easily an entirely different source than the original problem.
---
3.) They did fix the damage bug, complaints about it have disappeared. I started having it happen to me but once the patch it dissappeared, even after going up against the same enemies using the same weapons. 
---
Once again, you pull facts out of your own ass. You have zero proof it didn’t work, you can’t even claim to have played the game since. 
---
4.) The one thing you’re partially right about is “hotfix”, apparently it means whatever the fuck a company wants it to mean.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotfix#Vendor-specific_definition
---
But every gamer I’ve talked to before now has used Blizzard’s definition, even other companies. Gearbox loved hotfixes on consoles for Borderlands 2 because it was obnoxious to push MS and Sony patches last gen.
---
5.) You have officially shifted the goal posts once again! The crux of your argument now rests on splitting hairs over the definitions of hotfix and patch. Not on the substance of what was fixed, changed or added.
---
6.) From now on all “patches” and “hotfixes” are “updates” because debating the difference is irrelevant to the original argument of how much has been done to improve the game over a recent period of time.
---
The game received it’s last update ~2 weeks ago, not a month. Said update had few changes but said changes were over very annoying to critical issues, thus they actually had an appreciable impact on the game. 
---
Nothing has been done because of Christmas and New Years. They haven’t announced patches or patch notes until just before release the last couple of rounds to help ensure the patch notes are actually complete.
---
The only one who’s allergic to using search engines is you, you would have known at least half the shit people have told you before you first opened your mouth if you had bothered to use one.
---
P.S. - I told you earlier I’d laugh if you tried to say 12-19 didn’t count “because it doesn’t fit muh narrative”, thanks for the lol.
---
Honest question, do you actually enjoy repeating failed arguments and being so utterly predictable?
---
Yes, your arguments have failed when you have to resort to moving goal posts and splitting hairs over what something is called, rather than what it did, to keep going in a debate.
---
The SBQ isn't for unprepared people you mean cause my 62 alt does more damage than most people including my lvl 154.

Experiment to try if they give us the mats: place mat on roof. See if ground floor spawns in time for you to land on it. Voila! Indoor fast travel point.
---
Add some others too. He can "sing" eye of the tiger to people trying to fight scorch or mirelurk queens. Or another one bites the dust when people are farming.
---
Thank you for being part of this awesome community!
---
I'm more than game at some point. Just hit lvl 102 but I will never turn down exploring 
---
Yup okay I'll gift you a win if it's so important to you. Call it a gift and pay it forward. Maybe try not being an ass on every post. Shit you told me karma was pointless but then need an online win to feel better. 
---
I've looked through your posts it's about time you had a win so here you go. Hold onto it. You might not get another for a while. 
---
If you want lots of easy food you can just go to the farm workshop to the south west of the vault, the fields contain wild razorgrain so if you just pick about 20 then grab some wood and water you can make razorgrain soup at the campfire which restores food and water as well as granting disease resistance.
---
Pretty easy to get and the farm to the north also contains power armour on some occasions 
---
Damn O'Driscolls. I hope you got a plan. 
---
you didn't bother replying to any of what I said so sure, I'll take it.
---
What difference does it make? As long as you get a shot off you still get xp and loot. 
---
Someone out there is salty with me. I see you down voting litreraly everything I post or say. Hahaha good on you for not having anything to do. 
---
I swear something changed after the hotfix with either damage or enemy armor. I have noticed i can't even one shot sneak hit lvl 40 Glowing Miners the past two days with my 2 shot combat rifle (non explosive) like i use to.  But then lvl 62 ghouls drop like flies for me. I guess i should be checking my gun damage everytime i fast travel
---
And what exactly makes you think that? Seriously? Ive been posting about this game since launch and you think Im trying to stage something for no reason? Really? 
---
you able to join?
---
Stop pre-ordering items from a scam company? Also stop buying Fallout games? Grow up people.
---
Fuck me your dense. I told you very clearly I didn't read it. Shit take your win and run you're failing to read single sentences. 
---
Find a really good spot for your c.a.m.p
---
Cloth I believe makes it heavier than what it was 
---
Aha, not to worry mate, we all learn new rules and tricks everytime we have a play!
---
The safest option is to keep pacifist ON, so in the rare chance you do hit someone, it's only a slap. Generally we're all at a Whitesprings nuke event for the sweet sweet flux and glowing meat ;)
---
I see pool balls get ignored when people clear out all the other plastic in a room, as well.
---
Yeah, there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of rhyme or reason to it.
---
I am for sure. I like the pace, the inventory management bit gets a little tedious but the rest is great. I think there are probably a majority of people like us who do enjoy it that way. It's easy though to feel the pressure to rush through to the end game content and server hop to try to find the two-shot explosive legendary weapons when we're also active here, and constantly hear about it. Part of me wishes I had never discovered this sub and was still able to enjoy the game 100% on my own terms, without my views being contaminated.
---
yep the spread in vats is worse.
---
Handmade.  Period. Unless you find a great legendary for something else.
---
Dude, this guy is off his rocker and hasn't said a thing to me about why he thinks this. Ive been playing this game since launch. People like him are the kind of people that make me hate this community sometimes. I really enjoy this game, but the community is slowly making it harder and harder for me tbh. Luckily most others have been chill.
---
I personally haven't tried it but have you tried going back to the machine that made it and put in a request for another? 
---
A level 1 pipe wrench with 30% more damage to feral ghouls.  I just got a Board with 30% more damage to super Mutants of a legendary Behemoth today too, it was level 25, making it the second shitest legendary weapon I ever got for the hardest fight I ever did... 5 Behemoths.
---
well, yeah. that's exactly what I said. you didn't bother replying, so I'm assuming you didn't read any of it, either.
---
you conceded anyhow so it's all good.
---
Ahahaha!! Steel, ffs!
---
Using a .50cal machine gun CHEWS ammo like it's a Rambo movie.
---
Having the +80% ammo crafting perk is a huge difference in my ability to *mow shit*
---
I've comes across all of them i think been attacked by a couple wise ones too, always seemed odd since they're only level 1.  
---
as for your mutation theory it is implied under the Mothman Museum that he was around before the war, so much like the Flatwoods Monster I think he may indeed be a prewar anomaly and not an irradiated one. Same for the taming complaint, as they appear to be more closely on the human spectrum than animal.
---
My Fallout characters are always named after communist figures, and my new one is Lenin. He actually reasonably looks like him, too, unlike my hatchet job with Trotsky
---
I am on PC. if so IGN is gothamknight123 add me 
---
I found pennywise in a fridge at the whitesprings golf club
---
Came here to say the same. Made it so some small town where there’s a trade center. Some high level left a bunch of plans, weapons etc... oh and power armor and fusion cores. I can’t use the gear yet and most of the weapons but power armor helps with carrying :)
---
Contact customer support for wherever you bought it from and they should have some leads for you. 
---
Missing parts in stuff aren't super uncommon and I'm sure there is a way to get a spare.
---
The only problem with passive mode is if the attack you first
---
Midwest represent!
---
Seems like a stretch to me for a very common practice . If they were to do a nod to the Simpsons it would probably be around the power plants .
---
nuka trapper at the vault and I got red menace in last repair room in Poseidon power plant
---
How much are they worth in-game? I’ve got some plans that show at 5000 caps. 
---
No way bulking increases weight and if it does it’s
---
unnoticeable. 
---
When I was overweight, I bulked and every time, I’d save weight. 
---
I started a second character and have been exploring and leveling without doing any story quests.  Just killing stuff and doing events as I come across them, and dailies when I remember to.  Just hit level 40, it's been pretty comfy.  It helps that the combat is, to me anyway, fun enough on its own.  I like how most of the weapons feel (just not lasers, and the 10mm stuff feels a bit weak), and the ragdolls make killing enemies pretty satisfying.
---
Not that I dislike the main and side quests, but ignoring them completely has resulted in a different pace that I've been enjoying.  Simply not having those markers on the map, reminding me that I have stuff to do, is nice.  May go back and do them all once I'm 50 or higher, but I'm in no rush.
---
Last night I wandered into the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort and found a whole buncha glowing mole miners fighting with another whole buncha supermutants, and spent about an hour fighting with both.  Ended up using all my ammo and switching to their their dropped weapons, and was healing myself with dog food for a good bit near the end.
---
A cargobot was taken down at some point during all of that, I think mostly by the miners and supermutants, was a nice bonus.
---
I have the Carnivore mutation now and I love it. I dont get why people say herbivore is easier because you can farm veges and take them with you. Really you dont even need to take food with you when your a Carnivore because everything is the whole entire world is made of meat (except for Robots :P ).
---
Dogs, wolves, radstaff, hounds, bugs, mega sloths, gulpers, bears, deathclaws, Scotch beasts = all meat
---
Ghouls, Mole Miners, Super Mutants, Scotched + the Cannibal Perk = all meat
---
+ Butchers bounty perk = Twice as much meat
---
Plus dont forget that you dont get diseases from meat all all which means you dont even need to cook it and even if its spoilt you can still eat it. And because it does double the amount of benefits means you dont even need to eat much.
---
And with the Carnivore mutation it doesn't mean you cant eat fruit and veges, it just means you dont get any hunger bar filled from it. So you can still cook a vegetable meal and get the perks from it and then go out and eat the whole entire world.
---
Probably dont need the good doggie perk anymore though, replace it with the  Dromedary perk and never worry about food or water again.
---
Turn Fallout into pacman and just eat everything and everyone. Mutant Carnivore Cannibals for life!!
---
Yes Sir. I had seen treated several times and just happened to get this one. I only purchased this one and treated and have no idea how I got the others.
---
[Shielded Marine Wetsuit](https://imgur.com/a/tGwrijZ)
---
This makes me sad
---
Workshops got em
---
I just click on workbenches or chairs to come in.
---
Yup you got your online win. Well done you :) it's the small things in life.
---
Your sorry probably doesn’t mean much to a dead man.
---
I mean, while I do want them too I wouldn't say there's no reason not to have them. 
---
I assume, since they're still available for workshops, that Bethesda was concerned about people building under the map and that sort of thing. The downside to that sort of construction is getting into the unraidable/unbreakable base takes time and quickly becomes tedious. The Fast Travel Mats eliminate that tedium, which helps discourage people from building in locations that aren't easily accessible.
---
Why is that Civilian?
---
Discovered this other night. Turrets are worthless when you have bounty. I Acquired said bounty, while bounty hunting, and can only assume he ran into someone else's base, to evade.
---
Yeah, he didn't. But I wound up with a price in my head, for the 3 rockets I sent in after him.
---
Went back to my stronghold, to wait/fight it out.
---
Killed 2, was eventually taken out by a group, and my turrets never fired a shot.
---
lol good luck getting the furious to stack
---
bethesda needs one too
---
No you do not.
---
I had a TSE double barrel, and even with all the mods I had on it the damn thing shot insanely wide on hip-fire. But the minute I aimed in, barely any spread at all. It was magic.
---
Where did you find the plans for that poster? I’ve never seen them 
---
I came upon an extra Eye of Ra a while ago, and I've just been hanging on to it.  If you're on PC, I'd be happy to let you have it.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
What they need to do is have VATS stop locking onto non aggressive players. Gun fu has gotten me into more squabbles than I can count. 
---
I don’t have a problem with disconnects when playing around 7-10 pm Eastern. Around 11 and after the disconnects start. In my experience, anyways.
---
This is a great post by a good player, level 230 here offering my help as well.  Anyone need stimpacks?
---
I've come across this as well. been playing for a while (currently level 135) still hoping on getting an explosive shotgun. while doing the uranium fever event I've had this happen with all 3 legendaries. also seen it happen in white springs while the place is nuked  
---
There worth 10k caps
---
Yes, it's all that one groups fault bad things are happening in the world.  
---
No one else.  Just that one group.  
---
nuka grenades are awesome nuka quantum grenades are good for SBQ and other enemies that don't move much.
---
There is actually a fairly disturbing scene involving a refrigerator in the novel.
---
I've turned my camp into a fight ring and offer players on my server something to do lol. Its a lot of fun with friends. 
---
At whitesprings
---
I have found an accordian, and acoustic guitar and a hand drum, the fact I could not play any of them made me depressed.  i carried them about for a while just to have, but I can't even put them in my camp.  Why Bethesda, why...sob.
---
I did the same thing. Didn’t figure it out until level 30 something. But once you hit 50 you can reallocate a perk point from one stat to another. 
---
Everyone is,  Dc'd at least 5 times today
---
In an online game mods give players an unfair advantage over others. If I was a developer and wanted to ensure a fair game, I’d want to block those players. 
---
I think it was wrapped in paper, if that helps...
---
Can’t ft I’m at watoga station 
---
So you tried to leech XP, and instead got baited into losing your junk? Raiders are a thing in FO lore you know, and they frequently used tricks. Im jealous of your immersive experience.
---
thanks.
---
So block all the windows as well then?
---
This game needs mod support and private worlds
---
I mean the percent chance to hit. Is that what you mean, too? Specifically interested in rifles.
---
This is the real question.
---
Bethesda take note.  Bugs aside the thing that this game 100% lacks is an actual server community cause we hop to new ones constantly.  Please bring persistent servers online and/or allow private server hosting.  This game is like a RP wet dream!  
---
Please and thanks!
---
Yeah I'm in your lobby 
---
Bye bye bears.
---
Maybe that 200 cache weight we're still waiting on will be implemented for the vendors?
---
Can you help me launch a nuke 
---
The 2 times I’ve tried either the game crashed or my keycard mysteriously disappeared 
---
My name is “soggyest”
---
There's a hole in the wall at one part that has a room with a turret in it pointing out. You can see it if you go around the perimeter. I think if I remember correctly though I could be wrong there might also be a part with a hole in the roof. If so it also has a room you can lock down. I can't remember exactly. If you really want to get paranoid you could also put a bunch of stuff in the room like shelves that they would have to destroy to get through.
---
I leveled someone's base yesterday for this. Very intentional. Tried to explain why in chat but they just kept shooting me. So I killed him along with  his base till he quit.
---
Thanks and thank you for offering the same.  I’m willing to group with you as well.  
---
And I toss tons of items, materials, etc per day 
---
Nuked the fissure site today and the queen flew off the map. Pretty discouraged
---
I don’t wanna leave the Congo oh no no no no no
---
Ooooh boy!! I LOVE THE DOUBLE BARREL!! but I'd have to carry 3 or 4 in the weapon wheel, fuck reloading in the thick of it haha!
---
bonus if they are wearable.
---
I saw one, but could not pick it up.
---
I'm on xbox, if you're on there id be down to do it tomorrow   
---
my gt is heisenducki
---
I leave all my extras in the overseer’s cache in the Flatwoods Church. I figure new players have to go back there a few times so they will probably find it. I always leave a few dozen purified waters, all my duplicate plans and recipes, ammo I don’t need (someone tonight got 1500 fusion cells), some food and some crafting supplies. The occasional legendary if I have a low level one. I like imagining a new player stumbling on this amazing cache and it totally making their day - I know I would have been thrilled to get that stuff when I was a newbie.
---
are you able to spam sirens with all of them on?
---
Wankin that meat!
---
I thought it was that turret room, but you need to get through a door as well, which I locked. I covered the hole on the roof as well as locked the door after that hole. 
---
Maybe I'll try doing what you said though. Just place a bunch of shit they'll HAVE to destroy.
---
Yea I was surprised to hear rule one of Fallout is avoid cars/kill them because i thought i was a genius since i see cars all the time at whitesprings
---
so many cars, i just assumed blowing them up upset the robots until a teammate told me otherwise and now I kill em.
---
&gt;The safest option is to keep pacifist ON
---
I'll have to remember that, my teammate is uh "twitchy" so i haven't turned it on in a while.
---
&gt;Generally we're all at a Whitesprings nuke event for the sweet sweet flux and glowing meat ;)
---
People try and start fights with me pretty often ;-: I get stimpack'd by randoms a lot too tho lol
---
Normally, you shouldn't get wanted by accident, without warning and when you did nothing really wrong
---
Ha. Concrete boots would be fine if it weren't my wife and son! =) 
---
Or try to find the corpse when its blown to pieces and launched across the map.
---
If it hadn't been fo Cotton-eye Joe ...
---
Or move things like workbenches away from holes in the walls. If they can click it, they can warp in.
---
I would assume all of them.  Wouldn't take too much effort to check.
---
I keep my camp upriver of that behemoth, that way I can get an easy kill with decent drops every time he respawns while I collect purified water and grow my
---
Blackberry garden. 
---
I shoot him to get his attention and then kneecap him with my shotgun once my turrets open fire.
---
Why must you ignore me T\_T
---
Buck buck bucket!
---
I’m only level 35 but I am enjoying it a lot too even with the crashing
---
My body is ready mr law man.
---
I don't know how it works in this game, but in fallout 4 I could destroy enemy brotherhood power armour in a couple of hits - and once destroyed my own with an explosive shotgun. If it was a TSE pump action with the right perks I don't see why it couldn't destroy X01 quickly
---
I prefer the free states but I also have no friends. Can I join anyway? 
---
Lmao dude take this boomer nonsense somewhere else
---
Fuckin “sense of pride and accomplishment”-ass comment
---
It really whips the llama’s ass though
---
It is rather meh.
---
Patrol Duty for Weapon Plans
---
Distant Thunder for PA Plans
---
Census Violence because I enjoy it
---
AWOL Armaments. Guarantees 3* Legend at end, with chance for more during the waves
---
Hordes. 
---
That's about all I do, lv. 207.
---
You just need to anchor your construction to a single foundation piece. There are a few reasons for this message but it's because it's trying not to leave floating pieces (or specifically floating upper floors, they need to be connected to a foundation through a set of stairs)
---
My favorite version is “he loves but fuckin.. butt butt fucking”
---
But now they have to pay that off to another player witch helps that player and punishes you by making you give stuff to others.
---
Of course :) 
---
I think I've seen it at Phoenix,  the BOS Vendor in Watoga, just recently. Lv 207
---
Hans what Hans I didn't ask for a Hans to get me a Luger 
---
I like the Skeleton look of camps. It would be nice to build the skeletal frames maybe. 
---
Former MOBA player here, Fallout 76 has been such a refreshing online experience for me. One can only hope the toxicity of MOBAs dont find their way here. 
---
Rev up the vertibirds it’s scorched hunting time 
---
How do you know?
---
Lol jk Ik the feeling. 
---
I did once by picking the lock on a Water Purifier, then the pop up came that said taking anything will make u wanted so I stopped, then got wanted. I then exited the game after a few. Came back a day later, and was still wanted. 
---
I think the radiation is meant to do that?
---
All my workbenches were in the center of the building, unfortunately. Maybe there was a chair they could access through a window?
---
Platform?
---
Nah, it was just one kid going "WoW' 
---
Wish we crossplay. I'm on ps4.
---
I did that. I tried to link it to many foundations. Ones that is snapped to the ground and other ones snapped to the building itself. No luck. It’s a 3 story house that I’m building and I had this issue on the third story when I accidentally placed a floor outside. I tried to scrap it but it won’t let me. So i tried the stairs trick and connected the 3rd story floor to the second story floor by a stairs. Both of them are stuck now. Tried to connect the second story floor to many foundations but nothing. Don’t know if I’m doing this wrong or I screwed something up but it’s annoying and I’m willing to pay a kidney to get it fixed haha
---
I guess you can look at it like this. Just because you're allowed to do a cannon ball at the pool, doesn't mean I want you jumping near me when I want to have fun too
---
Y'all got any more of that Special Blend?
---
Yeah it is too long to read for people this days. I am human of this days, i did not read. Sorry
---
you complaining about level 23s while me, an innocent level 11 trying to visit whitesprings got screwed by the queen
---
5 minutes is way way way too long. 
---
Well instead of jumping the gun and just making assumptions about what I said. I never claimed to have a problem with pvp I made a suggestion for the game and then told my experience to try and back up the need for my suggestion. The sarcastic comment doesn’t help the situation by any means.
---
See I always wind up with embarassing mic stories. I was around when someone was in their camp and they just let loose a fucking ear-shattering fart. I busted out laughing and told them '8 outta 10" and i think the guy muttered something and started laughing too
---
Except for some major balance tweaks to make leveling a bit less grindy and make some builds more viable I think this game is pretty ok atm. Its getting better slowly. Hopefully now that the holidays are over we can get some real updates coming in.
---
When I was like level 13 somebody kept hitting me with some ski sword and I was losing health annoyingly fast. It was dropping at the same speed as if I was standing somewhere that is +25 rads/second. I had to use three stimpacks within a minute to stay alive. When I finally shot back, he one hit me.
---
What's he drop for you? I've only gotten him once. Was 35 caps or something. Very lucrative. 
---
Level 11 looking for general supplies here, and some directions. Currently in the last test of the Firebreathers with no Purified Water left.
---
Did you want people to discuss the 50 different things you brought up?
---
As soon as they get posted on YouTube they get nerfed. I expect the poisedon power plant to get nerfed soon. I still run it though, and a couple other ones I hope don’t get too popular. I’ll farm for a bit when I log on and hit all the vendors selling the stuff and then once my vendors are done I’ll start server hopping and do the same three cap stash runs over and over hitting the white springs up at the end of each one before changing servers. And I’d say about 90% of the time at least some of the cap stashes are there. When they are ALL up it can be worth more than the vendors easily. 
---
Okay awesome! :) I'm looking forward to playing it again when I get some time. I only got to play it for like an hour as I'm in the middle of a move and it's in a box :P
---
Use the perk card "Skeet Shooter" to get better range with tight groupings. [Here is a Reddit conversation about it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9v5qfo/has_anyone_tested_the_effectiveness_of_skeet/)
---
Agreed, but I don't think it's working too well especially when someone can grab a radiation suit, and just run right in.
---
I got it at level 1. I was disappointed when it didn't show my m79 arch. I don't use it very often but swap it with green thumb when I am in a building. It's okay. Lol 
---
I’ve played for about 170 hours, am only level 62, and haven’t done almost any of the main missions (no BOS or enclave stuff.) I’ve still never been to the cranberry bog area and i’ve never used power armour. I never do melee, my main weapon is a lever action rifle. I’m decked out in fabulous deep pocketed trapper armour for that sweet extra storage space. I die a lot and a lot of my bullets get shot into open air next to the enemy. I only play solo. And I’m having an absolute blast! I’ve never spent this many hours on a video game, ever.
---
I really love just walking around, doing daily events and side quests, capturing and defending workshops. I’ll sit down with a plan to do some of the main mission and then 3 hours later I realize I haven’t done any of it. Tonight I spent my evening doing a couple of events at the penitentiary.
---
Gauss rifle
---
The entire game is bad
---
You're still above me. I also pre-ordered, but between work in real life and just strolling through Appalachia I'm only level 12. Just built my first one room shack for my bed, stash box with my cooking station and tool benches out front. 
---
Make armor penetration build, get booblehead, psycho, food. Kill it in first land.
---
/r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Unfortunatly only the queen and the lvl 85s drop decent gear. 
---
Anyways, congrats on your feat! You're a better man than I since I couldn't take one down until I finally for a 2 shot LAR to drop. 
---
Only time to nuke anything other than those two is if you need a ton of nuked Flora, then you nuke a farm that has a lot of plants. But even then if you have the green thumb perk then you can get plenty of nuked Flora from whitesprings 
---
My issue is the whole game is bad and Bethesda is trash now
---
62lvl is actualy 12level over cap, thats max level...
---
I got a little bored. I put around 100 hours in. Not salty about it though, I still log on to play through the missions with my buddies and wife. I’m sure it will be like fallout 4 was and I’ll get reinvested as they update it . 
---
And then once you have placed the camp item, you then find that your existing camp building will NOT place anywhere - sorry structure is floating.... my arse it is not OR another object is blocking teh placement.... oh is it that twig, that stone or that slight f-in slope..
---
Seems to me it costs caps to move your base BUT you cannot really move your base, something always stops you from being able to place it down. so you move somewhere else, you look round its as flat as its ever goign to be with no stones, bush's or trees in the area... great your thinking BUT nope something somewhere is stopping your existing building from being placed.... WTF is this. Not only does it say 28 caps to move but it is more like 90+ (had 89 caps and still could not re-locate due to not having enough caps) since 5 attempts all failed.
---
This is sooo f-in pathetic from bathesda, no wonder people have quit, not just this issue but many issue's.
---
I have a quad double barrel with 50% extra limb damage. Its fucking awesome even though its a level 35. 
---
I'm level 301 currently and its been fun.  Kinda grinded to a halt though until some dlc comes out.  
---
Yeah I heard she does that when she's aggroed to someone and the dc
---
Drills are OP as all hell right now lol.  I'll take one!
---
make friends with a death claw "RUN LIKE THE MUTHA HUMPIN WIND VAULT DWELLERRRRRR!!!!!"
---
Oops wrong reply, lol
---
I will help you, so long as you are okay with speed running through it
---
You must have kids too. Hahaha.
---
Add me
---
Haha I was really confused for a sec 
---
It's people that crashed or lagged out. 
---
My absolute blunt observation with Fallout 76 is.. it really does have potential, but Bethesda just seem like they cant be bothered with it.
---
Lol my bad
---
I think there's a way in the turret room by going through the conveyor belt somehow
---
Just checking in to see if you played AC: Odyssey before making comments about it. Maybe you watched a few YouTubers who told you what to think?
---
Leeching would imply I simply shot the enemies and then ran off but further inspection into what I said clearly shows I planned to stay and help kill the enemies I just don’t have the armor to face tank all the ghouls. Yes I know raiders are a thing but let’s be honest here we are all vault dwellers and as much as you want to roll play a raider you can’t. Only thing you can do is run around and try to grief people or annoy them. Hence why I made this post so if I do end up on the end of those who like to make the game less fun for others we aren’t completely screwed out of the time we spent in the game.
---
Yah the game has potential but right now it’s pretty bare bones. 
---
Dang I'll have to block that as well next time. Just in case. Thanks!
---
Didn’t even think of that.  
---
A lot of those players are picking locks on resources machines and trying to break into workshops. 
---
I actually had the same thing happen to me when deploying a frame to take the core, I walked away before the auto recall kicked in and I lost ownership of the armour - went back and it was still sat in place
---
Like there’s literally a plasma explosion already in game. Same with the little fusion explosion assaultrons do when they die. I wish they’d just use those!
---
i think the percentage seems to be the same but the spread makes it miss anyway.
---
Doesn’t have to be that exact time just to give someone enough time to go back and grab their loot if they want to.
---
That's shitty.
---
? There is no max just lvls dont really matter after 50. Not sure what you are trying to say.
---
Didn't know the levels went that high haha
---
She doesn't spawn at whitesprings
---
That's fine. I'll just stand directly on top of your bag so you can't pick your stuff up until you get frustrated and leave. Then I'll take your shit lmao 
---
Does this make you feel better? Do you want your bottle?
---
Ok awesome
---
*marge simpson voice* He's right, but he shouldn't say it
---
You are clinging way to hard on small things I have said and assumptions and it really shows how weak your argument is. For one I have multiple friends who I have watched play and even the past couple days I have been playing myself so I have plenty of experience with the latest attempted fixes and they haven't fixed the crashing to desktop on PC, I play on PC and so do my friends it crashed every time I closed the game today. Same with duping, you can tell they were talking about the most popular method because all they did was change it slightly, actually making it easier and then tried to fix it again and failed, again.  I mean if you even read my original comment I don't have a problem with the game disconnecting/crashing while playing so I don't know why you think I am making any claims about it. I don't know if you are just blinded by rage or the aforementioned idiot is slipping out a little more (you really like to borrow my adjectives don't you?) but I really don't know what you are trying to prove here considering you supposedly have been playing a ton all the this time and don't even know these problems haven't actually been fixed, it really kills any credibility you have, same as basing your entire argument on me saying I haven't played the game in two weeks and how that somehow equates to me having 0 exposure to the game like I was locked in a closet the entire time. It was kind of fun watching you dig yourself into a hole clinging to that statement so hard, you really thought you had something there haha. Anyway you should probably do some research into the game before you try to claim you know what's going on, being wrong isn't something to get so mad about.
---
level 120+ and love it. Most of the community is awesome.
---
Do not join queen fights with those weapons please. We bluescreen without rendering masive explosions.
---
I agree, there are moments in this game that are very memorable. First time through, I tried to take the power plant. It kept going off every time I went by, and time and again I either ran out of time or healing. The place was so confusing! Other quests kept bringing me to the exits, and that clock just kept ticking. Then one day, with almost no armor, I dropped off all my junk and took it on. Me and a baseball bat against all of them. I snapped and stopped looting. By the time it was over, it was just me and 30 mins on the clock to figure the place out. Damned good night that was😊
---
I think it needs a diaper change.
---
Man that'd be cool. Would open up the pvp potential too
---
Throw an orbital strike in the barn.  That’ll clear the room.
---
Basicaly same thing like you did.
---
I've also been playing around with pressure pads and laser trip wires. So far only connecting them to a siren, but might start mixing them with some traps. If someone gets through it's good because it just means the defender has to adapt and find new ways to make it more difficult, costly or even impossible for them to succeed.
---
I just need some money 
---
Use stash boxes to block stuff makes it harder to click on anything else 
---
If your carrying a lot of junk to sell, get distracted by gunfire on your way to the shops, dies and drop a bag.... that’s on you. 
---
It has its flaws and is rough around the edges sure.. but I like it. Thats kinda like what my wife says about me, although perhaps using more "colourful" language
---
Someone needs a Snickers bar.  
---
Sweet !!
---
Oh so you mad mad
---
Me (level 94) and my level 196 friend nuked Prime, we can handle her ourselves but about 12 other people under level 50 showed up and killed us both by running in front of is while we were firing (we have explosive weapons) and ruined todays run for us. It needs a level gate desperately 
---
Luckily we still have smart, awesome people like you.  People who can't be fooled.  People who will save the entire video game industry by bitching on Reddit.  We owe you a debt we couldn't possibly repay.  
---
I think OP means the whole scene and not just the beer hat. 
---
Right, we could actually start arming large units of people, produce player based jobs, and generally stimulate the economy. 
---
If someone is constantly producing manufactured items, someone is going to buy it. 
---
Supply and demand. 
---
I don't think it works that way, but ok.
---
What do you mean by can't be bothered with it. It's only a couple months old and they have stated they will continue to realise new content for months/years. And based on tes online I wouldn't have any reason to think those statements are false.
---
You've said so much here that I'm not really sure how to respond. 😅
---
I will say this. They're a big company. They have to be to pull off what they do. A lot of people who are complaining don't understand how big companies like this function. 
---
The names we know (Todd Howard et al) are really just figureheads. They only have so much time in their days, so they can't possibly be in there about every single issue for every game their company makes all the time. It is silly to blame them for anything other than their own observable actions and words. 
---
I work for a big name tech company and I'm not at the bottom of the totem pole, but there's still about 10 levels of supervisors between me and the CEO. I know that bugging the CEO about the bugs we fix is a waste of time, instead, we have direct reports and supervisors for that. It's all a big complicated machine. And in my experience, the more bueracracy and the more rabid the fan base, the tighter the control on the company secrets. Where I work, so much is on a "need to know" basis that progress can be slow. We end up reinventing the wheel because we're not allowed to know about what someone working on the same project in a slightly different team is doing, at the risk of something being leaked, either to the media or to a competing company. Sure, not every company is my company but there is a lot the average bear doesn't know about how these big companies can be. It's not like complaining to the manager at Chipotle and getting your burrito for free. It's like submitting a ticket about your complaint and the issue being fixed weeks later because of all the other things that have to happen first. 
---
Honestly I'm getting pretty fed up with the general complaining. People sure like to act like they know everything about something they know nothing about. We don't know how Bethesda works. We don't know what their plans are unless they tell us. I know it would be really foolish to spend tons of money on development for this game and then give up on it a few months into release because there's a few fixable bugs.
---
I think we're just passing the lookie-loos at the moment. You know, the people who buy every game as it comes out, power level and brag about being overpowered and good at everything when they've really missed out on a huge chunk of what the game has to offer. Once those guys are gone and it's just the true Fallout fans left, I think we'll be in a really sweet spot.
---
We know that people who work at Bethesda probably really do want to create a good experience for their players - whether it's from genuine good-hearted-ness or just to make sure they keep getting a paycheck. 
---
Regardless, I've been pretty delighted with their games. I'm easy to please but there are very few game studios that seem to really put tons of effort into their games. I am still amazed at the sheer amount of stuff there is. 
---
I really realized it when I was talking about playing with someone who didn't play video games. It sounds realistic, you know? The immersion is second to none, at least in my experience. 
---
PC, user Jay911.
---
Did the Belly of the Beast quest get bugged recently? I was in the middle of that over the holidays, set it aside to do some other stuff - completed Mayor for a Day, in the hopes that not having bots attacking me 24x7 would help me finish BotB more efficiently, and now BotB is not in my quest list, and turning on the Brotherhood radio station does nothing. I have been to the first two beacons and don't know where to go from there. All they offer at this point is "play back last transmission" - no option to resync.
---
I have tried jumping servers/worlds to no effect.
---
I'm doing rifles, but thanks!
---
Lore-wise, this one is a huge deviation. It's so early in the timeline and in this area there are no non-vault survivors. If you're experienced with survival and sandbox games, this version should be easy. All Fallout games reward picking up everything you come across until you're encumbered, all the way back to 1, but this one gives the best return.
---
Pickup duplicate weapons/armor and scrap them to unlock more modding options, that's all I can think of that isn't intuitive.
---
Yeah she doesnt spawn there. Ive nuked it 7 times so I would know.
---
Except there are tons of other pools nearby that you could go to if it bothered you so much instead of inconveniencing someone else just trying to have a fun time. An analogy isn’t necessary. You want people to play like you do and they’re a dick if they don’t. You’ve made that clear. 
---
I seen the same thing.. don’t know how to get it.. and apparently no one else does either, according to the lack of information about it.. 😔
---
vats enhanced combat knife
---
I turn on pacifist before hitting a blast zone just for those reasons...also, makes my need to be careful way less....... But if I wanna get someone, I just blow up the cars around em 😎
---
Just play the game and you'll get plenty of atoms
---
And NOT paid ones - free ones! 
---
76 in a nutshell
---
Lol, that's not happening. :)
---
She spawns on one of the roads leading up to the Whitesprings, on the South. I was on the lake taking control of a workshop and thought I'd check it out. Decided to rotate out of the mountains instead of climbing them and went face to face with the Queen.
---
Improving? Yes, but at a snail's pace. 
---
It's honestly pretty inexcusable, but not surprising. Hopefully, since the Holiday's are over, updates and patches will come much quicker. 
---
We'll see. 
---
Yeah same here iv seen a few players level 150+. And i have thought the same thing every time.
---
They cant have enjoyed the game properly if they have just winged it from the beta. I litteraly look in any building that i can enter i suppose some people may be on there about ten hour's a day but dont think they've had as much fun as i have. 
---
Tombstones!
---
I think it sometimes gets stuck on certain songs.  I can go days without hearing Bob Wills or Tennessee Ernie Ford or Count Basie, but I'll get the same Billie Holiday song twice in an hour.
---
I guess my post just attracted all the other players who like to grief as well.
---
It wasn't directly at the Whitesprings, it was on the South Road leading up to the hotel.
---
I'll try that thanks!
---
she spawns ONLY at fissure site Prime. That was a normal scorchbeast.
---
In your stash box. I had 635/600 the other day because my stash was full and scrapping my camp overstuffed it.
---
Will do tomorrow, am a bit tired.
---
Thank you!
---
I'll come help the fight
---
I bought the game after release (no preorders almost ever) and yeah Bethesda's entire attitude with this game has been taking the piss. I bought it after the first wave of bad press and thought "hey, maybe its not that bad".
---
I've had a decent amount of fun but there are serious quality issues and there is no end-game content nor is there any real "RPG" element present at all.
---
The /r/fallout userbase is a lot more level headed when it comes to deserved criticism whereas people will treat you like a pariah in here for expressing disappointment.
---
The thing that most irks me about this game, the development studio, the publishers and the fanbase is that somehow striving for perfection is not in their dictionary. If a game has faults "that's ok, its Christmas, its holiday time for the devs!". If a game crashes 24/7 it must be your computer or network connection.
---
To add insult to injury you will often get called "entitled" for expressing disappointment at this game... from people who very likely never played Fallout 1 + 2 in the first place and think that this is now "their" franchise to defend.
---
"Their" franchise is just Bethesda doing cash grab releases and branding/merchandise deals over producing anything good ever again.
---
You do realize that, in order for an item to be duped,  there has to be an original? So some people actually ARE finding them? 
---
Hell I found an explosive double barrel earlier today, my first really nice weapon drop.
---
u mad bro?
---
Here.  Take this cheese.
---
Direct quote from a post this guy made nine hours ago: 'This is a really weird thing to get so triggered about you feel the need to tell reddit'.  Irony or idiocy, you be the judge.
---
Nope. I agree i am so fucking sick of these half assed games that are simple cash grabs and so god damn broke they are unplayable but as long as people keep supporting them and buying them devs are more than happy to keep pumping them out.

Maybe the event should not show up for players untill they can enter the silos on their own, just like the Enclave events don't show up for ppl who have not passed the point where they need to access the command center of the enclave bunker

Oh sorry, must've changed up the names.

I'm new to end game Appalachia, I've been playing since Fallout 2 and I'm still not really used to the new stuff.

Am loving the ride, though. =)

I am selling a \*\* TSE handmade, 5k caps.

If you want to see more check out /r/fo76bazaar it is a good space for buying/selling fo76 stuff.

Make nuka grenades instead

Yeah I should start doing stuff like that as well. It's just hard to when the workshops are temporary and don't have a huge budget. I don't wanna use too much of my own scrap on them
---
\*yawn\*
---
Congratz man, the first solo does feel good.

If i find a decent low level legendary i go out of my way to find a low level player to give it to.

I saw few times that armor parts went apart when someone get killed by explosive weapon in PvP.
---
Haven't found the plans for them yet but I plan to soon as I do! 
---
Youtubers are all now a collective hive mind? Because I'm willing to bet everything, that not every Youtuber that's been critical of Bethesda is duping and selling caps. 
---
This shit is getting fucking silly, Bethesda gave this game a bad rap by releasing it in such a ridiculous state, not Youtubers pointing it out. Dupers are still fucking about because Bethesda hasn't done SHIT to stop them.
---
Doesnt make my statement any less truthful. I come to work every day and I cant be bothered and Im pretty sure my enthusiam or lack thereof shows sometimes. Bethesda are human too.
---
Huge oversights, server issues, lack of community interaction.. they started, then it stopped. A lot of spelling mistakes in the game (small issue but come on, they are not a couple guys in a rented office space making mobile games). I mean, a PLETHORA of issues plague this sub constantly.
---
^ this
---
Quad Tesla! I thought it was a myth.
---
Possibly the manta suit, its an upcoming Atom store item
---
Had the same thing happen to me a few days ago in the AMS, as I got to the top floor. cry and repeat
---
It's a weird glitch with two shots where in VATs the 95% chance to hit misses a lot more than it should. Or only 1 of the 2 bullets will hit for some reason. 
---
I thought this....then I ran into a level 91 deathclaw that are my lunch.  So I got 2 friends went back and the scorch beast did it's fart attack and they came as a team.  3 deaths later 3000 .50 cal they are dead and I'm standing fearful of more ammo loss.  Fuck.  That was a tough battle.  
---
Do you want to launch a Nukeman?
---
Doesnt have to be a Nukeman...
---
Nope. It’s real. 
---
100% in disagreement to this post. 
---
No karma system please. It ruins games for "bad" players. Makes it so no one does ANY pvp until end game.  I want to see more people into pvp.
---
Just go sowhere to get killed if you have a bounty. No big deal.  Go to whitesprings. People will be there.
---
There are plenty of fail safes to avoid pvpers, pkers, greifers. Server hopping, pacisfist mode. Use them. You dont lose anything of value whe a plauer smashes your camp. The bounty is heavier than the rebuild cost. 
---
Bethesda wants this to be a pvp game. They want that fortnite money. These karma systems drive pvp players away from games. The only pvp players would be end game finished power houses that are bored. No one wants to pve with the guy that has bad karma. So no one would bother until they are completely finished grinding for end game gear. 
---
This would make low levels not pvp anymore. Bethesda doesnt want that.  
---
You really worried about losing 50 caps or a little bit of junk? 
---
In a game thats intended to provide new content, updates, DLC, a typical MMO model our builds arent even complete if we are at end game now. Example: 4 and 5 star legendary items havent been seen yet. 
---
This system would effectively kill pvp.
---
So this post has definitely made it clear to not post anything about my bad experiences in the game or make a suggestion because for some reason y’all feel the need to just be assholes for nothing.
---
Kinda looks like aqua man? I hope so. 
---
5k 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Waits for griefers to visit player vendors and destroy their camps. 😐
---
Or they just jumped through the window. Not everything that looks solid, is.
---
World full, good luck
---
Somebody needs their diaper changed.
---
You can get 50lvl legendary armor pieces (if you are over 50lvl) from all event, even fertile soil with 1lvl enemies. Actualy thats more worthy than non legendary shit from enclave events lol.
---
I hate those people.
---
There are worse ways to spend your money, and your time. I mean, I could be eating Twinkies and watching the Kardashians all day. People who do that probably have things they think are even worse or even stupider. Maybe they think playing video games all day is stupid. To each their own! 
---
It's kind of bottom of the barrel to spend your time worrying about how other people you don't know spend their time, though. 
---
It's my money (that I earned), and my time, and my life, and I'm gonna spend it however the hell I want. 😎
---
Windows aren't usually wide or tall enough to get through though
---
I've only found 2 and I found each the first week of play.  I haven't seen one since.
---
Do a few powering up or workshop defense events.....get the Perception chemist perk, then turn each stimpack into x4 diluted....if you get the (forget the name in luck) perk card, chance to double it
---
Damn in a que to join
---
I keep getting kicked too. Been kicked 3 times in the past 30 mins. 
---
Needs to be burped too
---
Go be a nerd somewhere else
---
Alot of that damage comes from perks. Bloody mess, shottgunner, rifleman etc.
---
...considering having a multistory building and placing the mat on the top floor.
---
Now remember back on how long the game takes to spawn your camp... piece by piece. (Assuming you built a decent size camp)
---
I've already spawned into my camp multiple times falling for no reason. I think mats would exacerbate this issue.
---
That said id love to see such matts too... but id prefer they fix a fe of these bugs first...
---
It’s delayed a sec,apparently I’m out of keycards but a buddy is coming real quick. 2 min
---
I have Tesla coils on my PA and I purposely save legendary mobs for middle/end of a fight. That way, they've been tagged and had a chance to spawn gear. I've been seemingly 100% drop since.
---
level 9 and a professional at being eaten by those "suddenly on your face" mutants here.... this is a good story. I love it. Me too have bumped into high levels and expecting to be killed ... nothing happens. High levels just  walk away and leave me alone to continue scrapping my junks. Good community. I wish there is just one server so we all can be on the same world. That'd be awesome 
---
A level 11 was wanted for 250 after destroying a level 6's base so i fucked the level 11 up and repaired the level 6's base and gave him some stimpacks and ammo if he came back
---
Mine is on a cliff near the satellite dishes in the Savage Divide.  I only have walls on the two sides that face back towards where enemies come.  The portion facing towards the cliff is open.  I love it when someone launches a nuke.  I can watch two of them launch since the solos are nearby and when they hit Fissure Prime I have an incredible view of the mushroom cloud.
---
I like don’t mind Morgantown for nukes as long as you skip the airport and make sure you get the East side of Morgantown. There’s actually a ton ghoul spawns there. Having a group to force the respawns is the key to either place though. 
---
Why the faces? Just curious. 
---
You dont have to
---
Sold 
---
I wonder if Bethesda will use it to apologize for the release of this game.
---
I hear ya.  I've been playing on PC and I haven't really had any major issues for the past month, but now I get disconnected constantly.
---
Your mic might be hot as soon as you start character creation, change that as soon as you are able to.
---
Most of the time you want to keep Pacifist Mode on so you don't accidentally hurt someone. PVP isn't really a common occurrence so you don't have to be afraid of everybody. Half the time people will just ignore you, the other half of the time they will want to help you in some way. We are just that comfy cozy.
---
Caps (money), XP, and Stimpaks (main healing item) mostly come from doing quests and events. All other resources are only scarce if you aren't exploring. Game is best when you look at the map, pick a landmark that looks interesting, and just go there. Besides a couple of nooks and crannies, you will know without a doubt once you've entered a new zone. The place will let you know it doesn't like you. The Forest is all sunshine and rainbows.
---
Lore-wise not much, if you decided to play the game you probably already know what the setting is like. Almost all of the Fallout games introduce things pretty well and treat you like you are new to the series. FO76 is not so kind in that regard since you can't just go to a settlement and ask all the townspeople a bunch of questions, so you will learn things much slower.
---
Basically Vault-Tec built all the underground vaults to repopulate after the war, but their secret purpose was mass human experimentation, each vault being a different experiment. I am not a big lore buff but I think the current status of Vault-Tec is still a mystery after the war? Vault 76's true nature seems to be laid out as a control vault by the marketing of the game but this is questionable and I believe misleading by necessity. You will learn about the other factions in time but Vault-Tec might be something that new players probably wouldn't figure out in the game, at least not yet since the other vaults are still upcoming content.
---
Getting in now actually
---
Have you tried ATOM RPG yet, comrade?
---
What's with people on here complaining about "griefing" and having no idea what it actually is?
---
Its the PVP mechanic inbuilt in the game and believe me someone shooting at your base is not griefing.
---
Griefing would be doing repeated mic spam with loud noises, or running in front of low-level players in a firefight so you can deliberately get hit, kill them and then take all their junk.
---
This is great. Love the weirdness/originality. Is this the result of the camp duped items glitch that multiplies items?
---
Well said. 
---
Distant thunder, or other BoS events can get you PA mods plans.
---
AWOL evetytime spawn atleast one legendary.
---
Census violence is fun.
---
Yeah enclave stuff is shit.
---
One violent night is level 50 of Uranium fever. (farm till you get gut)
---
also meditation bullshit is good farm for caps/gunpowder/screws/ and steel from scraping all weapons
---
Messengers are fun.
---
Hunting boss events are good if it is actualy only 1boss killing. Yeah 25lvl legendary is useless but 6anglers give some good mats.
---
All low level events give meds and chance to get legendary armor up to your level.
---
I'm an adult, I'll speak my money how I bloody want. 
---
Because people try to take advantage of "Christmas noobs" when they indefinitely know the fact that their "handmade" Is mass duplicated  and they try to sell it at this "pre-dupe" price which is still not as much as an OG TSe handmade but its outrageous now 😂
---
Then leave the reddit and shut ur mouth
---
Fun fact when I need to get rid of junk ammo guns etc, I actually go to the overseers camp and drop it all there for the new players to get and use.
---
There's a video on youtube where a guy shows how to drop one on SBQ and you can kill her solo.
---
Agree so much.   Or “take this”
---
Saw a level 20 die to a 91 glowing deathclaw by the pumpkin house then disappear. Killed the deathclaw and saw they left their junk, pick it up and teleported to their base and dropped it all plus mine and some extra goodies. 
---
I have fast traveled to a defend event there when someone else controlled it, they had everything locked and blocked but when I fast traveled the game put me inside the building. It doesn't always happen, but it's happened more than once.
---
I usually use the shrug emoji, and they often times shrug back :P
---
Not everyone uses a mic.   Especially if there’s a language barrier.  Also some people use team chat only and can’t hear you.  
---
Dang man, I'm sorry about that. If you're on xbox want someone to chill and play with I'm always down to team up when I'm on. I'm pretty chill and like to joke around. 
---
Ive tried this a couple of times, sometimes it works or times it doesn’t. I think it might just be random, at least for me.
---
So which other bad release you're referring to? I mostly talking about games that been made by Bethesda Game Studio, if you're referring into game like Dishonored 2 or Rogue Warrior I might understand, but I don't recall lots of people mention these games.
---
Agreed . How else are we raiders suppose to get bounties worth something . Besides the caps are worth the mats they cost you in repair .
---
This place has circled the wagons. They've decided the games been maligned, not through poor development or ridiculous publisher missteps, but by hyper critical Youtubers and games journalists who've fabricated or hyperbolized everything in some grand conspiracy to cripple FO76 and bring down Bethesda.
---
The shit has gotten pretty ridiculous. I haven't seen people circle the wagons this hard in a long time.
---
I've noticed that happens sometimes when there is a lot going on.
---
Thank you for your tips.
---
I realize it is a bug and it will be fixed eventually.
---
Ok! 
---
I wish, but just a few of them will do either rather than none of them.
---
You're telling me if I come to your pool and take a dump, now I have to leave?! I was here first, I would like the chance to get a legendary too without punks like you insta killing them before I get a tag. wasted a lot of materials launching nukes :/
---
I'm there too. Built myself an impressive stairwell, but how do you deal with the scorchbeast? I've tried 4 missile launchers, but have to repair 2 or 3 times to kill the thing, costly!!
---
I've given up and just crammed my home in the cave :\
---
Like you mentioned about the stills being everywhere, it makes sense in terms of lore of West Virginia anyways. Half my family is from the area and I lived there myself for a decent part of my childhood and moonshiners and homebrew wine makers are far too common especially in the mountains. 
---
That's fine I guess.
---
Plus keep in mind these are the same people who buy a game which has an always on PVP mechanic and call it "griefing" when players kill other players or destroy bases.
---
They have no experience playing a variety of multiplayer games and although I don't really like using the term are what I would expect "casuals" to sound like.
---
Therefore all of their expectations of this game are not grounded in reality because they have no idea what to expect. For them, this is the greatest video game release ever and you are wrong if you disagree.
---
Yeah, that's true. I know there's no human NPCs, but they definitely could have been a little more creative with the quest paths. As of right now it's "finish this questline, which feeds you into the next faction, then finish their questline," etc. Would have been nice if I could say "I don't like what this faction was doing, I'm gonna tear down everything they've built so far" or "I agree more with this other member of the faction instead of the leader, I'm gonna focus on the direction they wanted to take the faction instead."
---
It's a shame, because some of the actual quest *content* has been a little more creative than some of Fallout 4's. I particularly like the soft quest markers that give you an area to search for clues or whatever, it's kind of refreshing to be forced to explore and find something. I also like the tests that had to be taken on terminals, which could be made easier by searching for answers or hints nearby, not to mention the timed agility and marksmanship courses which were kind of nifty.
---
And despite the popular opinion, I absolutely loved the DMV quest (barring disconnects and setbacks). It was frustrating, sure, but frustrating in a hilarious kind of way that really gave you that awful feeling of going to the DMV. You could really feel the sarcastic frustration the devs put into the quest.
---
Alright who gave Mario a power suit?
---
Well, if only one bullet hits, then that makes it pretty useless. Maybe I'll try to get a different prefix like Furious or Armor Pen.
---
Im bored explaining it to these people bro.
---
They are using ingame mechanics to add some additional gameplay value. Sure, its shoddily implemented and CAN be over abused, but the mechanics are there and should and will be used. Anyone not liking it can very easily (and without real penalty) switch servers instantly.
---
If some of these complainers actually joined in and had some battles they would probably have some fun battles, much like OP himself said. So not quite sure of the reason for making this thread
---
You bastards have already done enough! Leave the rebuilding to someone who knows how to use the power you Enclave buttheads squandered! Hard to see how you'll ruin the planet a second time but I don't want to find out!
---
Maybe check r/fo76bazaar
---
Fallout 4, Fallout 3, Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion. 
---
I think the only thing they did well was shelter. 
---
Ah. Makes more sense. Yeah man just bought a Tse gauss that does 1. 5k for 1k caps
---
Yeah, I'm an old geezer
---
Well that's kinda terrible
---
I'm an OG fallout 1 and 2 (even Tactics) player who waited years to pick up the Bethesda revival series because I thought they ruined it by making it a fps.
---
When I finally picked it up, I was floored. They completely changed the format of the game yet somehow kept everything great about it. Even the bugs are important for proper nostalgia, lol. 
---
This new generation defending 'their' franchise since FO3 are defending the same franchise as the OGs.
---
Yes.   I have gone back a couple of times and it shows no available item to fabricate. 
---
Just have it replace your pipboy light and turn it on whenever you want. 
---
I think only level 50 and above should be counted for her health and participate in the event. At level 50, you can have your damage maxed. 
---
ICBM joke in fallout sub falls flat? Go back to your serious discussion nerds
---
Yeah, I've had a few firefights that were fun and other times I've had a TSE guy that would get annoyed by my sirens and high pitch speakers at Whitesprings and would one shot my fusion generator.
---
I found a really simple solution these people aren't apparently aware of though. You don't need a reddit defense squad to help you fight the bad guys, you just hit escape, go to the menu and reconnect onto a different server.
---
Yes!
---
Right now? Anyone know what for? 
---
I'm still on. 
---
Is there any other alternative form of storage, or is that it once the stash is full?
---
Sadly it requires you to already have one on your person to make another. 🤷‍♂️ lol 
---
Yeah, but not enough by your own admission to discourage you. If you're a little over, small chip is fine. But a lot over? That'll mess your body up and it should show. 
---
Enclave did noThing wrong
---
Just server hop. But don’t worry they are wanted
---
2 nukes just landed boom disconnect

I personally thought FO3 was alright, it wasn't a "real" fallout game to me but they made a decent effort at making an FPS version of it. The pace of FO1/2 wouldn't work nowadays.
---
I don't have NEARLY as many issues as I have with FO3/4 as this SPECIFIC game. FO3/4 at their worst are many levels above the best parts of this game.
---
jesus christ on a stick that's a book

Are you going to teleport behind him and whisper "Nothin personnel kid" as well?
---
You get 3x higher damage numbers (even more in practice) with explosive than without, although you do need to switch five points into Demolition Expert.
---
Can you list any examples. I'd like to go through and see if they are sealed or public record. 
---
No maintenance, just a server needing breast.
---
I had my second Mothman sighting right at my C.A.M.P. right after I ported in a few days ago.  I got out The Dragon expecting that to drop him since I was twice his level, but it only took off about 1/3 of it's health.  He shot up in the air (I think), disappeared and then rematerialized after a few seconds.  I fired again and this time my camp guns started hitting him.  They must have killed him, but I never saw his health get below one half.  I tagged him at least twice, but I didn't get the update on the challenge to kill all cryptids.
---
Does anyone know why he just dropped dead when he had half health?  He left a purplish goo pile (I wasn't using energy weapons) with some random standard loot.  Why didn't I get credit for the kill?  Do I have to be solely responsible for it?  That's the only thing I can think of.
---
Just set up a bot that says this in any "Dear Bethesda" thread lmao. Same response, same lack of (in game) action, less work on your part.
---
Amazing work my friend! Although for the life of me I can not find the Mothman area junk pile but even so! Great job, I'm trying to use this map and another with workshop locations to combine them somehow. 
---
If you got a good group you run with then you will be fine if not, and you know you are going to carry then yeah it is a 6 gun fight easy.   
---
Literally had one a while ago that the queen died before it said finished death from above and had other go down to the last minute because 18-20 people that have no right to be there as they are under leveled and under powered show up. 
---
Where did they land?
---
That must have been where Bethesda servers are located and they just moved camp! ;)
---
 &gt;How else are we raiders suppose to get bounties worth something
---
as if this matters, you just get large groups of people sitting on top of a base destroying it and having their friends clear their bounty.
---
Bulk lead and aluminum 
---
Or in my luck, spawn in the middle of a nuke zone and unable to get into PA before dying.
---
Does it go well with OP’s whine?
---
Its nice to have a brain isnt it? I fear for the future of gaming because people keep supporting and buying these shit games. Do you think the devs care if your game works? Fuck no! they got your 60 bucks. 
---
Yup still hope they change that soon as possible though.
---
its a machete that can be 3 star, and then adding the cultist dagger mod making it 4 star
---
Stash, your inventory while walking around, and the inventory of stuff currently built at your camp. 
---
For example if you really wanted a bunch of wood but didn't have the storage space you could use your entire camp budget building wooden things (storing them in your camp storage optional, and that only works for built things) then scrapping them later for (I think) about half the cost of what they took to build.
---
This guy claims to be a financial executive and has no idea what he's talking about here. I hate to say it but you wasted alot of time explaining this to some kid who can't accept when he's said something stupid. 
---
Just an FYI, you don't need the flux to attach it, you just do it. The mats it's showing are what it would take to make if you had the plans for it, but if you own the physical mod you do not need the mats.
---
You do
---
Do you think the devs care if your game works? Fuck no! they got your 60 bucks. 
---
It was great idea to make little storage for players, so they must throw things away. And then limit vendors moneys, so people have to throw it on ground. Your system force us to be kind, gj lol.
---
At least you know your finger is never going to accidentally rip through the TP in the Fallout universe.   
---
They were actually trying however. They were standing in the claim area, and I got the notification that showed them claiming it.
---
I use a two shot LAR as a sniper. If I don't use VATs then it's amazing and totally worth getting. But likebI said, VATs is bugged. Sometimes 1 bullet hits, sometimes 2 bullets hit, sometimes (higher than it should) none hit. 
---
I mean, nobody said you were there first. I already said previously that I use one handed weapons. They’re fast but they sure as shit don’t one-shot anything. Meanwhile, I’m in there chugging away and some asshole runs along and lightning taps everything and waits. All kinds of people play this game. Just try to remember that it’s a game not kindergarten where everything has to be fair. 
---
Think ya replied to wrong person
---
Passive, or Pacifist mode doesnt reduce any damage. It affects YOUR outgoing damage only.
---
You RECEIVE the same damage with OR without it being on.
---
Same here except in my early 30's - I would dupe some more but cant find a way to craft follicles.
---
I think he's talking about Fissure Prime and not Whitespring.
---
Hopefully explosive shotguns are nerfed soon. But in the same balance patch they also fix the fact that shotguns are unable to properly hit flying Scorchbeasts, regardless of how far away.
---
So basically you don't like BGS's game? Because all games you mention above are great games that mostly well receive.
---
Yeah, I can't say I'm happy for having bought the game but people's standards are extremely low for this.
---
Its one thing to make a game which doesn't match up with what the "hardcore playerbase" expects, but its another to be 6 weeks after launch and still have servers which crash frequently.
---
And I'm not the only one who has posted here with the opinion that the crashing is likely unfixable due to deeply rooted engine/server issues and that even when more content starts rolling out the stability will still be shit.
---
Inb4 his marine confirmed kills
---
Only if it's a good vintage and it sounds delectable to me!
---
I really hope just in the future we get servers strictly for pvp so we won’t have to deal with stuff like this.
---
More like toking up some sticky soot flowers
---
tell me about it, bud
---
Its ok, its not a bug its a feature
---
That is more of griefing . I my self use it to lure people into pvp 1v1 or how ever many they have lol.
---
It's confirmed by multiple parties, unfortunately. The VATS hit chance is exactly the same as a non two shot version, but it will miss entirely quite often, even at 95%. They're best used for manually aiming or increasing bullet count for other legendary mods like exploding.
---
No it reduces your Incoming damage and your outgoing damage
---
Outgoing Damage is 0 with this enabled. Simply read The message when you attack someone it says that you can’t damage other players. So please don’t correct me with inaccurate damage
---
Number 2 tip: as soon as you start bulking, you're probably going to need to start hoarding plastic
---
Nice try, Microsoft.
---
thanks for answer. I'll find that way.
---
if your on ps4 can i have your stuff?
---
But they're not. 
---
exactly no one is getting one shotted if you are you were either wanted or did damage to some one else first
---
Frat bots, here I'm thinking terminators would be next in robot evaluation not frat bots
---
Very disappointing comment to read. Reported for breaching reddiquette. 
---
I feel like in time 76 will get to the point you can do most of that stuff. At least I hope it does. Only problem is pretty much having to wait for all the stuff to be implemented.
---
A variant. Like a vengeful mothman or alpha deathclaw
---
Did the same XD
---
No. There's a square around it that you can't nuke.
---
Thanks for shitting on people for doing stuff having nothing to do with you. Calling us stupid for supporting something you don’t agree with is just childish and dumb. 
---
Haha.  But I’ll probably return.  
---
Idk - at 301 I'm still enjoying it here and there despite having accomplished all my goals. 
---
Upvote for assclown fuckery
---
I'm playing what a ghoul at WSR with my All Rise to pass time.
---
Was playing with my partner (we're around level 27-29) in the starter areas again to help out a friend who just got the game. He emerged when another player did, and he saw me drop some stuff for my friend. I immediately noticed he saw that and went on mic and said "Ah sorry buddy, you won't miss out!" gave him some water, stimpaks, plans, and some .38 ammo... he obviously didn't know how to emote yet, so he started bunny hopping. cue all four of us bunny hopping outside Vault 76.
---
If I see someone come out of the Vault, I will usually give them some corn soup and lots of hydration with a couple Stimpaks thrown in. I even gave someone exiting the Vault 1038 things of .38 ammo and even pointed out where they can pick up the Pipe pistol
---
I've been holding myself of installing it because I don't wanna get in trouble for using it, but soon I need to install it as well. There's just so many perkcards to switch when lockpicking or hacking, or being in your camp.
---
There are no fast travel mats in FO76.
---
I'm level 110 and haven't got an exploding legendary yet. Gotten over 7 two shot guns but still waiting for that moment i can lose my mind finding a tse weapon or even a good exploding gun.
---
damn.. i can hold on to them for you? lol but i feel you just hit 100 as well. finally got a tse handmade pretty sure it was duped *shrugs  but all im doing now is trying to platinum the game.
---
My build will be a passive mule character that carries and crafts everything for the team.
---
I don’t think people do this out of innate altruism, they do it because the Bethesda overseers are indoctrinating communist behavior through their manipulative Pinko trading system run by robots and severe restrictions on amassing personal property.
---
That's what the wasteland is like though.
---
How come its acceptable for scorchbeasts to spam sound and attacks but not for players to do the same?
---
Doesnt work. 
---
Have you removed the lockout from the terminal? You do that on the lower level security room beside the cafeteria.
---
I accidentally threw a grenade at a friendly fellow I had just given some plans and receipes. Fortunately we both were using microphones and we got a good laugh out of it. I'm surprised so many people rely on those emotes. They seem so limited.
---
The whole second part of what you just said is exactly what the other guy said which is that your outgoing damage is 0. But whether you have pacifist mode on or off you still take reduced damage so I’m not sure what you are trying to get at.
---
What's that first bit you quoted?
---
And yeah, thats why I addressed that dig specifically. I think you're completely wrong. As an OG, my personal favorite of course is New Vegas among the Bethesda games because it stems directly from the events of 1 and 2. But they were all good, and all "true" fallout games.
---
76, as an odd prequel, is doing just fine. From the complaints I read online I fully expected almost zero story but I'm pleasantly surprised at what they were able to accomplish with notes, holos, and robots. Since the first 2 games were all reading anyway, I think that's the highest fidelity of them all, lol.
---
What specifically is killing the game for you? I just keep hearing that it should be better, and that's not really a good reason for all the hate.
---
I’ll admit there is some fun things there.   I love batting practice in the golf course clubhouse!  Ba-ching!
---
Yeah i too bought the game despite bad reviews. I really wanted the game to be good. I quit at lvl 30 after 2 quests bugged out and i couldnt complete them. No end game and little content. Its been 2 weeks and all i read about is how the servers crash every 5 minutes. I have no interest in logging back in.
---
Oh man. There was 3 players. If they are lit up, they are online. If they are greyed out, they've logged off.
---
Also, I've played several times on totally empty server. Longest time was just the day of official launch, I was the last player for about 10 hours. I had played maybe 10-15 hours before the second and third last left. I don't even know how I managed to play that long that first time, I didn't even start playing when I had just woken up, I had been probably awake for like 30 hours or so, before I went to sleep. Have had the server all alone few other times, but it usually involves a fairly long session, like 7-10+ hours. 
---
Perhaps little oddly, once the server gets old enough, it doesn't seem new players are given that server. Probably makes sense, just to keep it until the last player leaves or "disconnects".
---
yea, the terminal that you unlock right?
---
Someone nuked Charleston and I went hoping to see something new.
---
Nothing no scorch-beasts, just lvl 62 Super-mutants. killed about 10 then just kept running in circles.
---
-.- firstly I’m the same person
---
Secondly it is still accurate because it does reduce damage as you can’t hurt other players which would allow full damage.
---
Flying is a glitch in the first place
---
Sorry but you are mistaken
---
If you meet someone in game and they start shooting you, you will take the SAME amount of damage no matter your Pacifist settings.
---
The damage you deal to others is affected sure, like I already said.
---
Just had the same problem. Did she find a solution?
---
I'm also tired of killing legendaries in general and not getting credit for the respective enclave officer's quest, whatever it's called.
---
Also while I'm here. SCORCHBEASTS. CAN WE TONE THEM DOWN, PLEASE. It's bad enough that they're stupid powerful. It's even worse that they're ALSO extremely hard to hit because they fly, extremely hard to kill because they're so high level, extremely annoying because all they do is spam you with screeches relentlessly and basically blind you. If you don't have at least 10 stimpaks handy you might as well give up because good luck trying to get away from one alive! Oh, and it makes it *super* fun when there are TWO circling you. So not only do you get a continuous stream of screeching, you get double the damage. Woot. Seriously, that's gotta be a bug or something.
---
Seriously, I heard the Mario jump sound when I saw it.
---
I have remained exclusive to melee except right in the beginning.  Batter up!  
---
It will get better.  
---
In CAMP, no. We can build them in workshops though for some reason.
---
I never said they were the same nor different. Please do not imply something that isn’t said.
---
Whoops no my bad for assuming. 
---
That don't get scraped with JUNK!
---
I get downvoted for saying this, but you people go on about "deeply rooted engine/server" issues and such  and constant crashing, so how do you explain that you have someone like me (and probably numerous others who dont talk about it) who dont have constant crashes, i go days, even weeks without a significant crash of any kind, and the most I get is the server not responding messages but I know for a fact that is my internet, not their servers because the same thing happens in just about any multiplayer game I play. Or do u think I am just lying coz I am paid by Bethesda to shill the heck out of the game?
---
Now im not saying this game is absolutely 100% perfect or that it was a perfect release, i dont think anyone is really trying to say that, but I believe that a lot of what people are saying is highly exaggerated for effect, and a lot is just storms in a teacup. The game will obviously continue to improve over time.
---
I have seen these exact same arguments time and time again, most recently in Star Wars Battlefront II. things like "oh the devs are lazy, not communicating, dont listen, stealth nerfing, game will be abandoned in 6 months, etc. etc. etc." guess what, time goes on, the biggest haters move on to whatever is next on the hate band wagon trail, and ur left with a decent game and a decent community.
---
I always miss the good ol' I'm sorry emote
---
This is the weirdest booty call I have ever seen.
---
The guy is going in circles, best to just leave the thread before he pacifies himself to death with slap damage
---
i will be on in like 20 min if u still have him
---
... This isn't Ark ... It's Fallout 76, it has consent to pvp, what on god's green earth are you talking about? The game is not a kindergarten? The game would wipe your ass if you asked it. My point is, I'm trying to farm, and people with TSE ruin it for everyone when they just insta kill everything and we can't get our legendary because of this dumb tap system.
---
THIS IS WHY WE NEED PRIVATE SERVERS?! To keep clowns like you from pooping in the punchbowl.
---
Two-Shot Explosive guns
---
Wait are you saying I was wanted? I can assure you I was not
---
Power leveling
---
You ever figure it out?  I think it just happened to me.  I didn't see it say "Marine", but I know I bought the combat armor plan from the BoS Vendor in Watoga, but when I went to mod my combat armor, I didn't have it.
---
if he wants to run anything, just sell the macbook and build a decent PC
---
He literally just died..
---
I dont mind limited time 800 atoms stuff. I do mind it, however, to be shit.
---
Super duper
---
Now you mention it, 300hrs of fun for £50 does seem like a bad deal.
---
I’m such an idiot, I’m getting a refund.
---
Did you get anything from the queen? Spinning arrows for me.
---
At the lowest floor of the Capitol building, in the security room, you can select to remove the lockouts from a list of usernames. You need to select the one for Senator Blackwell, then go back up to the Senator’s office to load the tape.
---
Found a video that shows it:
---
https://youtu.be/qp8aepEVVAk
---
I have heard that Marathoner(sprinting consumes XX% less action points) also doesn't works while using power armor. Haven't tested it though.
---
thanks! I'm full up right now but want to scrap my camp and design something more simple/stable for moving about the map and was afraid the game might arbitrarily expel my more important stuff like springs, adhesive, etc to make room for the wood and cement etc
---
But that's a lvl 50 perk.  Probably should be swimming in stims by then.
---
I've had the same problem with a shortage of equivalent two-shot and non two-shot weapons to test, but as far as I can tell, two-shot weapons fire one shot high and the other low when sighted, with a bit of additional spread on each. If VATS works by putting your aim right on the target, it's possible that both shots could miss.
---
Hip-fire accuracy is also absolutely horrible. Probably separate params though.
---
Dominatrix consults price list for that: “It’s fifty extra if the bum joins in”
---
I'm glad I never tackled survival mode on 4.  Now if I need a break from 76 - I've got a challenge waiting that I now have a little experience with.
---
It's really weird. Some of the game's handicaps are encouraging helping other players.   
---
You can't sell/scrap ammo, so the best you can do is dump it in front of a low-level player just to unload you inventory.
---
You can't really trade since there is no auction house and bot vendors are limited to 1200 caps/day, so you just dump excess legendaries to whomever you meet.
---
You can't really engage in PvP because it's too hard and unrewarding, so you're better off helping some low-level player farm those Whitesprings ghouls.
---
I never expected this to happen, but I really like it. Couple of days ago I was defending an Airport workshop, and it was slow and boring as hell, so I just dumped some gear and ammo for a level 19 player who happened to be around. Then I crafted a fully moded lvl20 rifle for him. It's really easy and doesn't cost you anything. 
---
I live in a row house but when I have my headset on my wife doesn't complain about video game noises. ;)  
---
Harmless snark, play any way you want. :D
---
Sounds good I'll be on tomorrow 
---
Not only did someone lag in front on me and blow me up, but my junk was taken and the queen was spinning for me too.  Womp womp
---
Well what kind of nerf could be perceived as fair? I've had some thoughts...
---
You could reduce the strength of the explosive effect but that would make it pointless
---
You could make it a chance to explode so shotguns wouldn't be so dominant
---
You could make the explosive effect reduce the damage of the gun, and do that damage as aoe instead so maybe 25%  of the guns damage has a chance to be dealt as aoe damage
---
Make two shot and explosive modifiers mutually exclusive, ie they both sit in the same legendary stat slot and can't both be on the weapon
---
Which of these would actually work and also not render it completely useless? Would they make things "balanced", or would some new meta come along that replaces TSEs and then we all complain about that instead? I think the latter 
---
I got confirmation as well.
---
Surprisingly it seems that they’re giving the 500 atoms as well.
---
You guys should load up Ark Survival Evolved...all party members in range earn xp for just surviving 
---
together. It'll eat your soul though, so just dip your feet. ;)
---
The fact that it is so easy, so many people know about it, amd it just uses in game methods is just proving their point. Bethesda doesnt care about 76, it was an attempted cash grab that backfired. Its a 2/10 game despite how much fun you can create for yourself if you can look past almost every detail of the game
---
Ok I’m sorry dude but I think you are getting extremely confused so I’m just gonna say everything from the beginning. You said pacifist mode reduces the damage you take. What you said is incorrect. It only makes it so that you don’t do damage to other players. That is it. Even if I have pacifist mode disabled and a guy shoots me I still will take reduced damage the only reason I would take more damage is if I shot him back but that’s not what we are talking about. So if you have two players one who has it enabled and one who has it disabled and they both start getting shot at they both will take the same amount of damage. 
---
Good point.  
---
He uses the macbook for sound recording and mixing so I don't think he'll sell it to get a PC
---
I cringed
---
It isn’t inaccurate because it reduces damage like normally. You also have implied something that wasn’t said.
---
I don't know man, I spend my nights at Whitesprings collecting items like "Ghoul Slayer's Wood Armor" 
---
I have one for you. See pm 
---
I personally think PvP in a game like this is stupid. All the other poeple in the wasteland are poeple who grew up in the vault and set out to rebuild the wasteland like you.
---
I don't even think PvP makes sense in this game unless it's that jerk that used to bully you in the vault so you cross paths with him and "accidentally" discharge a shotgun shell into his head.
---
Ok dude I’m done I feel like you are just trolling me now.
---
Maybe by this time next year they will have added some content.
---
If I was trolling I wouldn’t be serious. I am quite annoyed
---
I'm in the same boat! There are dozens of us! Dozens !! 
---
U up?
---
You're welcome. :)
---
That sucks man It was crazy out there, must have been 20 people in the nuke zone. Still had fun thanks for letting us know.
---
Good Maybe if i can get some more people testing and conforming i can edit the thread so more people can see this and wastes 20+ levels running serendipity and action boy when those can go to perks that actually help
---
This right here, the reason a majority of FO76 players are wholesome, honestly I can't sum it up any better
---
76 has no story, it just has lore. Listening to someone else's story is lore, youre hearing a tale of the overseer through a really lazy system
---
What fucking universe do you live in where the #1 money making segment of the entertainment industry needs help?
---
Jeezus you are a fucking idiot.
---
Bethesda Support are 100% shit. They never respond, they bullshit, they ignore tickets, they close them unanswered... they're fucking terrible, the company is fucking terrible, they can all go fucking rot. 
---
Mostly that there are no factions and the story has no real bearing on the world. When you first start the game there are already nukes and scorchbeasts everywhere and when you end its the same thing.
---
There's no decisions to make and there's no difference in playing with a different approach.
---
The lack of karma and conversation trees is the most disappointing thing.
---
As for the story, I guess there is a "story" but almost every quest is about humans and the game keeps telling you to go to some place and look for some person who you already know is dead.
---
And in terms of longevity, once you nuke fissure there's really nothing to do except server hop and grind for legendaries. And I actually took my time playing, I didn't do any XP grinding, duping or cheating and I explored every single part of the map and didn't launch a single nuke until I was over level 100.
---
The nuke mechanic is kind of cool in itself, but they obviously wanted to make the game as accessible as possible so you don't really have to do any code breaking and there's nothing you can really control in the world.
---
CAMPs are nice but the level of customization is abysmal in comparison to other games. You basically have the option of different wall/floor materials and lights/cabinets which you have to fit into a tiny budget. You can't custom make decals or advertise your base.
---
Even the clothing and power armor customization is basically "choose a skin" or "choose a piece of clothing". You can't mix and match pants and shirts or use paint you find to design some cool decal or dye a piece of clothing. A lot of people on here say this is good because it stops people writing "rude words" but Fallout 1/2 were full of swearing, sex, prostitutes and sometimes rape so I don't really get their point.
---
The whole thing Bethesda wanted to make strong - the other players role in the world - is actually weak. You can find servers with 0 people on and its the exact same game. Players don't influence the economy or quests in any meaningful way at all.
---
In terms of grind I think the crafting system is severely imbalanced and its the same problem I had with Fallout 4. You start the game and immediately get power armor which is stupid. I see low level players with full power armor sets and pretty high end guns and because its so easy to find nice stuff there's no real value in it.
---
Combat is also very disappointing, because when you start there are enemies that will kill you instantly, but once you reach a certain level you can just kill everything with 2-3 shots (and I don't even have any TSE weapons, I mainly use a TS handmade).
---
Workshops are a chore to capture. You set up defenses that don't do anything because you have to physically be in the base or it will get overrun by rats (yeah my missile turrets won't kill rats unless I'm there for some reason). Plus they nerfed the workshop output making them even more pointless.
---
The most exciting moment I had in the game was when a supply drop came in one of the city areas and I saw 2-3 players shooting at it. It was really exciting and I thought "Shit this is some cyberpunk shit these guys are gonna shoot the drone and then pilfer it for circuit boards and kill each other to get the most supplies"...
---
...what actually happened is they killed the drone which resulted in nothing at all happening (you get XP but no additional supplies) and then everyone can just walk up to the supply drop and take shit without there being any challenge. If you take a situation like that, what's the point of even having other players?
---
Keep in mind I've not even mentioned technical problems which ruin a large proportion of workshops and other stuff. Servers keep crashing continuously. Either you get 3-4 hours of constant playtime or it crashes every 10 minutes. Or you (still) get an infinite load bug when you fast travel. Or the game itself hard crashes to desktop without even an error.
---
So is selling a service of cap farming wrong/against tos or is it just something people frown upon?
---
Guess I was unlucky then :(
---
The normal Scorched where my level too (35) whereas I'd read the mobs that attack were low level. 
---
Needless to say I wasn't prepared and I decided to ignore the attack and fast travel away 5 minutes in.
---
Septuple-ply, lead-infused, blast-resistant, 200 sheet rolls.
---
"!!WARNING!!: -DO NOT- SQUEEZE THE CHARMIN!"
---
Theres nothing wrong to taking a hiatus, in fact thats normal just like any of the past fallout games where you wait for the dlc.
---
Ah, in that case, check your Holo inventory to make sure you don’t have two or more copies of the Master Holotapes. I encountered a similar issue when trying to do “An Organic Solution” involving inserting materials at Harper’s Ferry and it wouldn’t let me because I had two “Phosphorus” for some reason.
---
You ain't wrong, this is intentional by Bethesda. They ignore as much shit as they can and people like Steven only step in when it pops up to visibility in social media and threatens their PR. 
---
They're fucking terrible. Bunch of shitbags didn't respond to any of my tickets ever, finally ended up getting a refund for their broken shit from Paypal since they couldn't be arsed to respond to fix anything.
---
then he's out of luck. those things aren't meant for gaming ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I don't know man, every now and then I'll vats, right stick, headshot a ghoul and it's body will low grav all limp/slow motion like into the ceiling before train wrecking back to Earth in a rag doll pile...I think you've at least got slow mo deaths...
---
no but once you hit him that let him do full dmage to you ..the OP was saying that he took full "slap" damage and thats BS
---
Go on this subreddit and Twitter and search for people who have the game continuously crashing. Client/server crashes are very common.
---
I don't have anything more to say about it because if you haven't realized the scale of how problematic stability is right now (on both console and PC and concerning both the server and clients) then its a waste of time trying to explain it to you.
---
Especially if we have end game crafting stations like decon lol i imagine they are missing the flux
---
"overlooked" like basically all tickets. They never answered a single ticket for me, once I got a "we're passing this to support to get back to you" and then NOTHING. Other tickets? No response. 
---
Fuck 'em. 
---
Umm.. is anyone higher leveled than this guy?  Anyone?
---
I laugh everytime I see someone mention the "economy" in 76. Thats some serious RP, y'all take it too seriously 
---
The other day a guy came up to me while I was on a in Lewisburg and dropped me a bag with 20 stimpacks and the diving suit + mask! He was so nice!
---
When I see someone is at Vault 76 (as in a new character), I like to fast travel over and wait for them to give them something, if I have anything. I have been inspired to pay it forward lol. 
---
Its a pvp game. Some of us want to play pvp. 
---
You just said you think its stupid. So why would you post to a message board where devs read to change an aspect of the game you dont use?
---
Then all the other PVE only players upvote this crap and the devs think its what the pvp community wants. Meanwhile: its the opposite.
---
Bethesda listening to stuff like this will lose them money in the long run. You guys are pointing the devs in the wrong direction. Please stop commenting on pvp if you arent pvping. 
---
Some of us paid for a pvp game. It really bugs me how the PVE community is sending messages to the devs this way. This happened in ESO too. 
---
There isn't a Mac version. 
---
Weird 
---
Bethesda never responded to any of my support tickets, and that was BEFORE the Bag Fiasco. 
---
They're just ignoring support for this game and their fuckups. Understaffing support and not caring if anything gets done. 
---
The Wasteland Estates Homeowners Association will be doing evals throughout the day tomorrow.

---
Thanks for the heads up, just went and grabbed the blaster.
---
Thank you. This needs more up votes. I had no idea the forest was heavy vs. Urban being light. 
---
In other words, you cannot explain it, so ur hoping u dont have to. 
---
Look I understand and am aware that there are many reports, but that still does not explain how there are people who dont have an issue if its supposedly a "deeply rooted" engine/server issue that cannot be resolved according to you. If that were the case, then everyone should be experiencing a similar experience. 
---
but hey guess what, im not complaining, so I think I will just leave it there and go play the game, and \*knock on wood\* that the deeply rooted engine issues dont finally catch up with me.
---
I've gotten that on 76...like wtf, lol
---
What snack did you eat
---
You can do alot in 30mins
---
Damn straight. Their support people ignored every ticket I entered even before the bag shit, did nothing, no response, no answers, just the occasional auto-response bullshit. 
---
They fucking DON'T. CARE. They sold a shit product, they don't want to support it, they don't want to fix it, they want us to just eat the plate of shit and smile. 
---
Summer sausage and triscits :) 
---
Plus you gotta get a high level early so you can exploit those sweet bugs. 
---
No rules, just different opinions of players, if you are low level some higher levels think it's their playground &amp; lower levels should stay out, majority I have found are ok - solo player myself. Just go in, have fun &amp; try not to hog legendarys is my suggestion.
---
Be honest with us, you tea bagged him after the kill didn’t ya? 
---
Congrats BTW
---
Warning : Do not ingest, insert rectally or allow into your bloodstream any lead infused toilet paper. 
---
Make sure you sign all death and dismemberment forms before shopping lead infused products at the Super Duper(R) Mart.
---
So it would run like shit, squared.
---
I actually think the game legitimately didn't kick me out after 30. 
---
I’ve been nothing but respectful in my comments but you can’t even contain yourself long enough to keep from being insulting for one comment. I don’t even own a TSE. Demonizing people that you don’t agree with is weak. The fact is you’re being selfish by wanting other people to go out of their way to play differently to make you happy. 
---
I don't know. I kind of like my screen name. Even though my character is female, and my name is MROBOTO. 
---
Thank you! I'm from farther south, but the information is far to common for it to be forgotten over 25 years. Especially if you have people that take pride in what they do and left notes for the dependents to carry on the tradition.
---
So you're seriously suggesting the game engine is good?
---
How about the duping issue? Do you find the current game/server engine to be useful for Bethesda to stop issues like duping?
---
I enjoy the parts where the server loses connectivity every few seconds because I use a crafting table... for crafting.
---
There's not much to say about it because its a widely known issue and if you can't see that you're either blind or delusional.
---
no, u mom gay
---
Neither of those guys could fucking care less. Todd Howard flat out lied about the game knowing it was shit, he's not gonna fix a damn thing. 
---
Good point
---
Every single item is duped 
---
Sure. 
---
But we don't know anything whatsoever right now besides bounty amount. And it's consequently a game of probability what you think they did. 
---
Allowing the player who was "harmed" to elect to forgive a bounty helps make that distinction more clear. 
---
I was waiting for a vendor today and the guy in front of me says "Damn, I forgot to bulk" into the mic he had obviously left open. I dropped about 200 caps of Halloween costumes and said "Look in the paper bag behind you". He replies, "Oh, yeah... Thanks... I guess.". I add, 'That should be about 200 caps worth.". He replies, "Right on Dude. Halloween, huh.". Could have sworn, I just met Jeff Spicoli. 
---
I get a bug where it shows zero ammo in gun and zero in inventory, but if I click the reload key it refreshes and it's all back.
---
Thanks, that video helped. I swear this game is the only game that I ever needed a guide for, lol.
---
Before it's not too late you can spec her into "stealth archer"
---
That would be creepy
---
Definitely not because I carry a hunting rifle and all rise. Got an explosive shotgun the other day and had a nice mix of all guns and melee
---
Don't turn this around and pretend to be the victim in all this. You know exactly what you are doing. I'm not being selfish, in this game, if I insta kill a legendary before you can tag it, you get NOTHING. You're defending a bad game design and rude behavior to people who also want to farm, because right now TSE weapons are making events more frustrating than they have to.
---
The only weak person here is you that can't even properly defend his case without trying to play "Woah is me, this guy is saying mean things" when you're points fall flat on their face. That is why you are a clown, a joke that isn't even funny.

Put yourself in pacifist mode. You'll thank me later.
---
Be careful not to scrap anything until you have stored your Hardened Mass. That is a junk item that is usrd in crafting Stable Flux. When at a crafting table you can accidentaly scrap it by selexting "scrap all".
---
Try not to use grenades or missiles since it males the bodies rag-doll all over the place and makes it harder to loot.
---
Try and get the Marsupial mutation. It can get you out of some jams by making you intargetable by melee mobs by jumping onto buildings/tall cars/etc.
---
Also, depending on your level, try to avoid the SBQ unless you plan on doing some real damage as her health adjusts fepending on player group size.

Weird because today even normal mobs were droppings legs. Like every single enemy. I got over 700 pounds of weapons and armor. Had to create a noob muel .
---
Hmm not that often.
---
I did some days ago had this really weirght thing that I got notification about getting disconnected, before the game even loaded. And then it got stuck just displaying the loading screen. Then I restarted the game again, got to see the world for about a second and then got disconnected again, but I recall at third attempt it started to work, or I gave up.

Like fo4 i made an alt.

He's getting downvoted because it turned out the people who were banned were not banned for using mods but for using Cheat Engine. The author of the video that originally made the claim has said this. The couple of copy cat claim have been caught out as not owning the game based on their post history.

Check your team mates too, cause if they get into it you get pulled in despite passive mode.

To add to this tip Morgantown Highschool has a ton of plastic pumpkins,food trays and utensils to help if you have a plastic problem.
---
I don't use pacifist mode, you do.
---
We both take the same amount of damage.
---
You don't flag, i do. That's the difference
---
You pay with blood
---
Im 301 and 99% the way to 302
---
He means : yes Buddy need to have one too. Else there is no interaction on the location
---
Oh. ☹️ Darnnnnn
---
It sounds like you would have just designed it differently if it were up to you. That's fine. But you played the game all the way through, so you obviously enjoyed it enough to finish it. Hell, there have been plenty of games that I liked that I never got around to finishing.
---
I think what they did was great, and if they had gone to far with faction wars and shit, it would just be *another* one of those games, but with a Fallout skin to it.
---
And dude, complaining that everything is deadly at the beginning but you're a good by the end? That's *every Fallout game*. Hell, that's most RPG's.
---
I get that bugs are annoying. I'm seeing considerably fewer bugs on PS4 than I hear people complaining about, though. And again, it's not like they stopped you from finishing the game.
---
It looks like there's plenty of game here, even for $60, and it's not even close to that now. It seems like you got your money's worth, and hey, no micro transactions! Could have been a lot worse.
---
I bought Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition on GOG for $5 the other day, and a single hairstyle is worth more than this (admittedly old) game?
---
Darn. ☹️ Thanks!
---
Good to know because mine has done this a few times too. Thanks.
---
What kind of shit was it?
---
I haven't used VATS since FO3 released. I just didn't see the point and it slowed me down a lot. I'm actually glad they aren't putting as much focus on it now.
---
I can help you out if you want, tag is same as here 
---
Not trying to discredit your work or anything but there’s also r/fo76bazaar that people use to trade things.
---
Yeah, I'm a real socialble guy and talk to every person I talk to (they usually don't respond). I would honestly hate a text chat feature. I feel like it would ruin general immersion and deter people from using there mic. I would hate to see less people use there mic.
---
At a mountain spot with a lead deposit.  Ammo for days. And random mongrels and wolves spawn to attack but underneath my generator shacks and dont know what to do.  Its awesome. 
---
It depends on how much you’re willing to spend, and you have to have the right perks on too whenever you use it.
---
If it's a tall bridge, explosive vent power armor. 
---
The queen drops decent gear? 
---
Shit, shower, ***** is to Shit, snack, shower as Shit, snack, shower is to Shit, shower, *****?
---
there probably a good deal of people higher than me - I stopped playing as hard around 250
---
I didn't get taken advantage of.
---
There is nothing i can spend such a small amount of money on to get so much entertainment out of.
---
Ive bought far worse games for more money.
---
Could maybe try doing the no emote when they send the invite. Can see if that helps any.
---
What is the damage without the perks? And what perks will I need to put on to maximize the use?
---
Just explode the cars if someone else is near and grab the bag
---
Usually I don’t even know where they’re at on the map though, I think they just want me because I’m getting to be a higher level player
---
Thanks again, not so obvious you need to scroll down and I wish they had a indicator or something, at least I don't see it, do you see an obvious scroll down on the right, mine sort of goes off screen. Anyway I was able to do it.
---
Ya bud, I somehow have two. But either way, I’m looking to trying tomorrow night. And my gamer tag is the same as my user name here. 
---
This is the real question
---
a support ticket which will then be ignored forever like the rest
---
An incredibly easier way to type is to download the xbox app on your phone, and connect it to your console. you can actually use it as a keyboard to type out things if the app is open (and paired to your console over your wifi) when you pull up the in console keyboard.
---
For sure! I think caps.city a little more geared for the job, with better browsing features and easier posting (imo). 
---
Yikes.
---
You don't want to know my experience today on ps4
---
Well if you have blood mess, all rifleman perks, and adrenal reaction mutation. The weapon can do about 3700 damage. But without it it does about 1500 damage. I have a melee build and a rifle build on my character and it works really great.
---
...You ran away, came back and were still wanted. Own up to your mistake, stash your junk and let things happen... really why are you, and the majority of this community afraid of dyeing? This game doesn't punish death an any long lasting way.
---
We all have to die at some point why do you want to hide from it?
---
I’ve thought the same thing about the factions; it feels like a tour of factions. I’m wondering if their main goal was to lay a foundation for future faction-based gameplay. Rather than taking the same road they’ve travelled in previous Fallout games by building in all of the choice/path options we’ve become so accustomed to maybe they’re giving details now so we can begin to decide which faction we want to side with in the future. At least that’s what I’m hoping.
---
every time I'm hoaring plastic I think about this George Carlin bit - https://youtu.be/7W33HRc1A6c
---
Dumb thing is if I do manage to kill the wanted people before their friends, their friends can then shoot me with their explosive weapons and 1 shot me making me lose money for trying to defend.
---
The thing that baffles be the most about this game is how varied the user experience is.
---
For example, I'm playing on a base PS4 from way back, I've been playing at least a couple hours pretty much every day since the beta and I've disconnected from sever a grand total of 3 times. I've encountered the weird elongated enemy bug twice, and had 2 bugged quests (the first the floating marker didn't appear, but I could still complete the quest. Second the Mr. Messenger stopped moving).
---
I believe the only other bugs I've encountered are the naked scorched, scorched with the wrong guns, and difficulty placing down CAMP blueprints/stored structures.
---
Big game critic.  Won awards. 
---
Most players are nice and forgiving, other players are scum and unforgiving.
---
Keep in mind if you want to craft the any single type flux material, you will need 10 of a single flux, 1 hardened mass (junk), 1 high radiation fluid (aid), something else.
---
Double plant perk is great for flux material hunting.
---
Demolition expert and rifle perks with bloody mess and tenderizer. Mayber batteries included cause the ammo weight. Glow sight i thing its called and tank killer with adrenaline reaction mutation
---
I'm going to be supremely interested in how this winds up working on PVP servers.
---
For example, will team immunity still apply?
---
Will SBQ fight immunity still apply?
---
Friendly fire is a huge problem in real world tactical scenarios. Given the pervasiveness of modern weaponry and the potential for CQC where friendlies (or unallied) players may be in melee range by mistake, what kinds of group play will evolve?
---
I'd like to see people adopting more realistic enfilade and defilade tactics. But that's going to be tough with limited comms and no command structure. In a free for all with potentially limited tagging opportunities for loot, it'll be in your interest to knock off SOME other players...but not too many. 
---
Honestly, I'd kind of like it if mob loot was single instance on PVP servers. 
---
I'd support this. My camp spawns me on a ledge.  Precision mouse movements to get to safety.
---
Shrugs.
---
I played for 6 hours today without a hitch.
---
But I'm on ps4 and have a unique network setup
---
Thanks a lot! Really appreciate you are listening to suggestions!
---
For Lore, watch Oxhorn's videos on YouTube.
---
Another emote: pick up this lunch bag I just dropped for you. I do a lot of events and workshops and have plans out the wazoo. Last time it took me 3 days to get rid of them. Last ditch effort I just peppered them in news stands around train stations. 
---
People please take bags this lady in a swimsuit and an eyebot helmet drops in front of you.
---
If you find lead ore or something else of value you can set up extractors for infinite ore (make sure to lock the extractor by pressing LT on it in build mode) or set up near a river for industrial purifiers, being near the middle of the map is pretty good to get cheaper fast travel outbound however. Since the landscape plays into how you can build if you find a bridge or tunnel you can build around it with foundations to become completely safe from attack. Tree houses can be made with a little know how 
---
Your English is plenty good enough to get your point across:  DON'T BE A DICK. Upvote for you. 
---
Hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahaha.
---
Thanks man I needed that. You're welcome man, it's not like this is the only game to ever have a rough start. But if posting on a fake account makes you feel big and tough who am I to stop or mock you for it.
---
&gt;  and as much as you want to roll play a raider you can’t. 
---
Sounds like he did. He tricked you, killed you, and if you had anything took your stuff. Sounds pretty raidery to me.
---
&gt;  Only thing you can do is run around and try to grief people or annoy them
---
Also sounds raidery.
---
You fell for a trap, and now you are not happy you fell for a trap. Thats normal. Id suggest looking into support groups, or maybe some sort of outpatient program to help you get over this traumatic experience. 
---
Bye.
---
Woah now, no need to get mad when you can just take a break.
---
I'd like to throw my hat into the ring Jrd_TD please
---
Ok, will 350 caps do?
---
no one cares about your Highschool drama, Dupers are a problem AND should be shunned for it, why would people call you a cheater for having a good weapon, unless you're walking around with 10s of them, initiating trades with people.
---
I feel ya in that regard as well. Because of school, I can only play on weekends because of all the workload I get in the week. I’m absolutely fine with the slow grind and leveling up about once or twice a day, and I also am in the exact same boat, preordered the game, played the beta when it was available for PS4, and just been playing it since
---
In an earlier thread it was stated based on testing that it was entirely tied to the level of the player that gets to the spawn first. You are level 112, so the queen is tougher. Not sure if that is accurate, but are you sure you are correct? 
---
The game is out since november and its been fuck after fuck up. You really think they give a rats ass about the players?
---
I would really LOVE to see this game to work at basic levels and things players been asking to be put into the game without question. Then we'll talk about invested more into this. I already gave them 70€ for this mess. And been playing it since day one. Level 68 btw. If they want to earn our trust, is not by exploiting the atom shop, but by giving ppl what they want.
---
Here's that attention you ordered, whiner. Go take a giant dump in your nylon bag. Not liking the game is fine, who cares. Calling fans stupid just makes you a fool. CRY MOAR.
---
Thanks, wanted to make sure before I invested in it.
---
I see what you mean. I’ve had similar happen to me. I’ll get a team invite from someone across the map or a random friend request. I wish people would just message their intent so I knew what they wanted from the beginning. Also maybe try the app for your phone. I use it all the time when people message me since it’s a lot faster to message back on phone rather than type it out with the controller.
---
Sorry man that’s way too little. But thanks for the offer though.
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't but half the time when I pull out my tse shotgun I'll be called a cheater 
---
Only
---
Yeah it was on ps4
---
I tried, hopefully they add me!
---
I don't think your assumption about the damage scaling is correct. Are you sure that is what is happening? 
---
I completed it because I wanted to finish it, but the story and quests never really gave me much interest. Since you already know going in that every human is dead you can basically play through the game on autopilot.
---
There's designing something differently and then there's actually designing it. For me there is no real design when it comes to the multiplayer component. That either comes down to "playing it familiar/safe" like you seem to think or "they really had no clue what they were doing and took zero risks" which is what I think.
---
I didn't expect a full on roleplay game where you type shit in chat like "/me bows before the newly elected sheriff" but I did expect some systems that made playing in teams and having some effect on the economy.
---
I realize being god like is common in RPGs but this is supposed to be multiplayer, so I was expecting something quite different. I would have enjoyed taking my time crafting leather and stuff to build basic clothes and storage bags and very rudimentary items. The problem is from the start you get automatic weapons so its hard to know what they were thinking in terms of pacing.
---
I didn't expect the economy to be fully player reliant either but the vendors are just lazy game design. Sometimes the game sends you a notice about it being a good season for plants/whatever but does any of it really matter? Not really.
---
I'd also hoped that the game would improve as I was playing it and I expected anyone embarking on releasing a multiplayer game of this scale would have systems and methods of adjusting the game's economy and keeping things interesting but there's no mechanic like that.
---
The only location-dependent things in the game are water purifiers (and you find water everywhere so aren't super necessary) and stuff like the ammo factory or fusion generators.
---
You can tell the game lacks a sense of ebb and flow because nukes only go to two places in the game. They get launched at SBQ or Whitesprings and very rarely anywhere else.
---
Anyway I could go on for ages about that side of things, but I'm very surprised Bethesda went through testing on this game and chose to ignore/not notice the technical issues with stability but also somehow didn't realize the game has no mechanics to speak of.
---
im just saying exploding shotgun vs a lucky one shit with car itd be hard but it just pisses me off knowing what kinda play he can make.
---
Merci &lt;3
---
remember kids don't go tse (?) 
---
Good! Go back to morrowind.
---
Having their screech attack come out their ass toward you while they are flying away from you is just downright dumb.
---
Trust me I understand the bugs can really put a damper on the mood. But try just taking a break from the game for a bit and come back in maybe a month or two. Maybe then they can restore your faith in them a bit.
---
Ohhhh, thanks for the bit about the unnamed mod pieces are for the excavator PA. I brought a couple and assumed thhe ones without a prefix would just work on any PA but they never worked on any, I did not try it on my excavator suit.
---
Mystery solved, Thanks!
---
How can one xbox crash while the rest are fine. They are built the same.
---
900 caps?
---
Brown. 
---
Like it, except for the Enclave part. I was level 19 when I joined the Enclave and I've helped my low level friends (7-9 at the time) join the Enclave.
---
Oh snap, I never thought of Bridges! I tried building one near the monorail towers but it just looked too goofy lol
---
If there busy with a mob u got time for a couple shots maybe a sneak shot.
---
I should've taken a recording today. It felt like downright abuse, I was about ready to rage quit it was so bad.
---
Which bug is affecting you the most? 
---
I paid 10k for it, I was thinking something along the lines of 5k or more
---
got these mixed up and trust me i like pvp i run pacifist off since day one i don't go out looking for fights but i do like to fight besides certain legendary traits the pvp is very balanced and I like that fair fight.
---
I have seen vendors selling mods for the Cultist Dagger, yes.
---
Fallout 2 isn't a Bethesda game...
---
I haven’t played for 2 weeks and now the game has frozen 6 times in 45 minutes.
---
I constantly get charged like 4x the price it states to move my camp, which I mean whatever money is worthless,
---
But the last 5-6 times I’ve played I literally have to spam the place button to place my blueprint because even though it’s green and there’s no error messages it just won’t fucking deploy it.
---
The balance is nonexistent random rad rats have like 6 billion health and do insane damage then level 40 supermutants die in one hit.
---
Quests are bugged. Everything is fucking bugged. The game Lags and freezes. 
---
I’ve given this game like a hundred chances and it just literally ass fucks me for it. I’m so tired of it.
---
This is back from a break. Breaks do no good when the whole thing is broken.
---
I see why people abuse every bug and exploit every tiny thing they can because how the fuck can you enjoy the game normally? It’s absurd how bad it is
---
TSE’ s  are for try hards 
---
Was testing my luck, all I have is 900 :p 
---
They sound op
---
...I don't know what I expected
---
I don’t think morrowind is all that really. It’s pretty good but eh.
---
yeah i honestly do thin pvp is very balanced if you negate all legendary effects of weapons
---
Too bad they didn't name Mr. Handy #1 Joshua. 
---
P.S. Ally Sheedy had a nice ass.
---
Why be humble? I dropped off loads of pipe pistols with large mags, suppressors and a stack of . 38s previously. My current go to is a level 1 suppressed BOS Recon rifle with . 308. It keeps the game fun.
---
However with the amount of steel I need to keep my Gatt repaired and fed means less resources for crafting beginner guns. 
---
different experiences paint different pictures, thats all I have to say, assume what you want.
---
I was having a ton of issues with disconnects and after a little research it ended up being an unstable connection on my end. Once I fixed that I almost never disconnect. It’s a big downside of a fully online game unfortunately.
---
I always show up in full enclave gear and a big goodie bag full of water, chems, stims, and food with a salute to the new vault dwellers popping their Appalachian cherry. Gotta get to them before those damn sisterhood jockies do
---
The game freezing repeatedly upon trying to complete this quest 
---
At the moment 
---
The balance not existing the rest of the time 
---
Ya, reason I mention that specific scenario is it just happened to me not more than an hour ago.
---
It’s alright, you tried lol
---
Is there a way to tell from the item description? When all your slots are full, it's stupid to drop weapons, pick up the new one to see how link holds it... Darn, it's one handed.... Drop... Pick up previous weapon.
---
It's especially annoying when doing Amiibo drops.
---
Sorry I haven't made flashcards to recall the names and the handedness associated with them, and I don't intend to. It would be super simple if they just had a little icon.. as they should for differing weapon types
---
Yeah.  Events and Missions give rewards, but if you run into something heinous in the wild you're gonna get shit.  
---
Truly, humanity deserved to be annihilated if the people of Massachusetts couldn’t put toilet paper on the right way.
---
thanks for answer. :)
---
Little tit bit Calibrated shocks do exist on excavator effectively having a set mean you get +200 carry weight they are rare. I Have assembled core? (torso mod)  for ap regen and overdrive servos on my legs n my excavator is pretty fast.
---
Lol, you are a moron
---
attach to a connector instead, it will power all nearby lights like in fallout 4
---
most lights you dont connect power to you connect it to the wall that has the light using power connectors which you have to buy
---
&gt;Because all games you mention above are great games that mostly well receive.
---
They're really not. They follow the same cycle. 
---
* Huge hype up to launch, any dissenting opinion is downvoted, shamed, etc. 
---
* Game launches, it can do no wrong!
---
* Week goes by, more and more flaws are being noticed and taken seriously. Defense of the game starts to slip.
---
* Glow has worn off, tons of bugs etc. 
---
* Modders fix everything.
---
* Months later Beth attempts to duct tape the game together
---
This repeats for every game. 
---
Beth has some decent ideas for games, but their execution is *always* terrible. They rely on modders to clean up their mess. Hell, look at the engine. Instead of moving to something new, or rebuilding it, they just keep patch working it together. They'll be using this engine for TES6 and Starbound (or w/e their new IP is)
---
Nice Argument.
---
Well just quit the game for like a couple months. It’ll be fixed by then and it’ll feel refreshing after you come back to it. I know how it feels man honestly.
---
Lights are powered “magically” when there is a connected power connector near where they are placed, even if it is on the other side of a wall, no direct cable connection needed.
---
Lights get their there power from proximity to a connector, not directly hooked up. Place a connector close to your light and connect the wire to that. 
---
I’m attempting to create a profile and I get an error for my username. “gamer tag is invalid”
---
I entered A_Tomato_ (my psn) 
---
I *have* the XB1X running this game and I swear I think OP is using some hidden settings menu or something to weak the game, cuz mine does not look this good.
---
I killed a Diseased Glowing Wendigo at Garrahan in the R&amp;D Dept.  
---
Not a thing worth keeping except some acid
---
Directly behind Sutton Station, as close as I could get it.  2 floor pieces with a sleeping bag, tinker, armor and weapon bench.  Campfire to cook and water pump.  I had a generator from a quest but it got destroyed.  Everything else has been set up since level 5 or so, now 28.  Once in a while I'll get 3-4 ghouls or molerats, but nothing that really messes with the camp.  Easy access to the vendor bot, central location for fast travel, has worked well.  Thinking of moving SE a bit, but would be basically the same setup near a station.
---
Feel free to use the facilities if anyone comes across it!  Look for loot bags on the floor of Sutton Station too; recipes, plans, fusion cores, missles, etc.; stuff you can't scrap or sell mostly.  Meds and grenades if  I looted too much that day.
---
Or crappy software is inconsistent.
---
Sounds like somebody needs a bubble bath followed up with a Bob Ross marathon.
---
If you are done can I have your stuff?
---
I'll try demolition expert, and I wasn't sure if rifle perks would actually work for it. Idk what bloody mess is, I'll have to check that out, but I am running tenderizer and batteries included. Thanks for the tips
---
My buddy was testing it out, and he said the MIRV looks like it releases the mini-rounds payload in the air. If you fire it at a 45 degree upward angle, you'll fire at its max range. Still not "safe", but at least the edge of the closest blast radius is a couple feet from where you're standing...
---
1 - PC
---
\- GTX 1060 i play the  game on maximum settings around 60 fps
---
2-Henri
---
4 - Every single time the event "Back on The Beat" starts the game starts lagging A LOT. It goes from smooth 60fps to unplayable stutterings. The screen freezes from 1 to 10 seconds constantly.
---
OH DANG, I NEED BETTER ERRORS! You can't add spaces to the gamertag. Sorry about that. I'll add a better error.
---
I give people food and propaganda fliers
---
As a fellow heavy gun player just a heads up, the weight of the Auto Gernade launcher does not reduce when using the Bear Arms perk. The weight of the AGL will be like 19-20 and your bunker buster will be like 2.
---
The AGL is supposed to be considered a heavy weapon but apperently when they nerfed it during BETA it also took out out if the Heavy Weapon categories so the heavy weapon perks dont apply to it.
---
I like using the AGL but it just weights too much when compared to the missile launchers.
---
Bye.  Thanks for letting a bunch of people who don’t care, and don’t know you, that you’re no longer playing a particular game among thousands of games.  So you do this for every game you stop playing?  LOL.  I’m guessing the OP will be deleted shortly.
---
Just walk in front of the ones using explosive shotguns while they are shooting. They will kill themselves and eventually leave the zone once they die enough times. 
---
I have a tse but I never use it in whitesprings as other people deserve loot along with experience for tagging.
---
They may not look large enough.
---
Saintly.   I teleport to events to help, especially when the players are low level.  I ping enemies so they're almost dead, or, if the others have dinged them, wipe them out.  
---
I drop something, anything, no matter how little I have, and give it away.  For example, I carry ammo I never use so I can gift it.  
---
Thats what the communists want you to do, dont let them win!
---
Todd Howard at E3: "more songs than any previous Fallout"
---
I hear about 8 songs, Todd.
---
Sounds like a great evening tbh 
---
oh no no no no no
---
https://youtu.be/WUl9NPPMx8s
---
I noticed this for the first time today. Nice to hear I'm not actually losing anything :)
---
The bottling company straight up said they used a 3D printer, so no molds were even used...
---
👍🏻
---
RIP.
---
I've been excited for and defended this game since I heard they were making a multiplayer Fallout. I've played since the BETA (got that sweet preorder discount). I think I've about broken even as far as how much I value my total gameplay so far. However, I'm only level 32. Given how long I've been playing and how heavy some of these enemy are, I'm thinking the game could use some extreme rebalancing as far as enemy levels and gun decay go. I'll happily fight a scorchbeast if I know it won't be +66% of my level and impossible to kill even by expending an entire laser Gatling gun. This game is really geared towards people who have all day to waste playing it, I think, and its distinct lack of a good story is making my sessions pretty boring. I'm not sure how long I can stand to play unless I find a friend who has the game as well.
---
Just turn your game on pacifist mode
---
he didn't know the bung was loaded
---
Wooden armor is good for a stealth build 
---
not sure if it's fixed but yea you could force scrap it to get extra acid and only spend some plastic
---
Could you create a checklist for items/recipes we already have? I would join you in a heartbeat if you had that.
---
That would be awesome. Even better we could see how much of given components we have when we find a junk item in the world so we can decide wheter to pick it or not.
---
This is fallout 76, not a college campus. Just because you want to identify as something, does not mean you can.
---
Pushed fix. Should be all good now.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
It wouldn’t be so bad if there was some way to take those dozens of shit drops and turn them into something you actually want. But obviously Bethesda thought players would love frustrating and completely unrewarding grinds :) 
---
btw any weapon you sell to the vendor will stay on the vendor, i have sold my main gun before you just tab out and go back and those weapons and items you sold will be there
---
Why should I continue to invest in this?
---
Like the ONLY reason I have is I like to play games with the wife and we can play this together.
---
And everything I hear Bethesda give news on is not “we plan to make the game functional, sorry about that.”
---
Few Grammar errors. But perfectly understandable.  Great job!
---
ITT FO76ers too slow to realize the game is a poorly made shitshow
---
Look clearly me venting my problem got to you in some way so I’m guessing you must be just like the guy I’m talking about and like to annoy players so how about you enjoy your day and I’ll enjoy mine because clearly all your trying to do is troll instead of having an actual conversation. Have a nice day.
---
Happened to me from ski hat
---
&gt;be me
---
&gt;see 3 star legendary Super Mutant warlord
---
&gt;attack it for 15 minutes because it keeps healing
---
&gt;finally dead
---
&gt; lvl 50 wooden chest that is 15% less damage from ants
---
I should have read first! I already went to a table and scrapped, but it looks like I lucked out in the long run because when I loaded back into whitesprings all the mobs by had respawned and I got them all to myself (75% were legendary).  800 shells later I’m out of ammo. 
---
It is a pity you cant, I wanted another Buker Buster but at the time I didn't have the carry weight :(
---
Hey Bethesda, its been more than a month now and the weapons crafting table from the Atom Shop, that golden one, is still bugged.
---
I place it down in my Camp, next time I visit my Camp it changed its location. That is Not cool for a 10€ skin
---
Thanks
---
I hear ya friend. Always welcome to join me or my group of buddies if you're on PC. Look for "Slizzo".
---
I love just exploring areas knowing that if I get caught I’ll most likely die. Adds a lot of thrill and realism for me. 
---
Drop a nuke on his camp.  Perfect waste of a key card.
---
Thanks I Like the strat will try next agro and TBH i feel like this is where the Bug or Feature part come in. The way if you don't run pacifist you can get into this i aggro you, you aggro me and if someone is a dick or "raider" they might just kill you and take some precious mat (hardened) mass for their own crafting needs.
---
I agree with you, they gotta have options for those kind of outfits 
---
Why not just accept the invite? 99% of the time people just want the free fast travel. If they start talking just ignore it than kick em. They’ll get over it trust me.
---
Me personally I always accept team invites. Because I know it irks me when people don’t accept mine and I’m just trying to fast travel real quick but instead I have to blow 50 caps on it
---
I feel good making regular runs to Flatwoods to drop off or hand out excess adhesives, plans, and recipes to starting players. It’s just junk for me, but instead of throwing it away, giving to newer players seems like the smart move to me.
---
So cute :’) 
---
Hey, I appreciate it! Next time I'm on I'll be sure to take a look :D
---
Mayor for a day quest makes them passive 
---
You finished the Mayor for a Day Quest.
---
If you completed the mayor for a day quest they no longer target you
---
Although I agree with you, I don't think I can play FO4 for a long time ... burned me out .. but I hear you .. still enjoying 76, around level 70
---
I wish you could be the dedicated radio do or have your own little station up. Would be so damn cool!
---
It’s not (always) an invite, but a party invitation where their mic feed comes through your speakers instead of proximity in the case of 76
---
I'm more worried that you carry 70+ radaway at all times
---
Not late, I update this when I get new info then make a new one each month.
---
Added and great pic, thanks!
---
Hi
---
I'd be Interested to know if you had any server hangs or other glitches like that.
---
Lots of people say that others duping items or doing other exploits hit the servers and impact other players. A solo server is a good way to see how valid their claim is.
---
He could risk it with a VM.  His best bet would be to buy a PC or run it on console.
---
I have that outfit also. It should be like other outfits and come in pieces. 
---
Actually your buddy might get a thing or two. But not everything you get. Me and my friends have been solving the maps we have. 
---
Those without the map have gotten at least one item when the person with the map digs.
---
Wrong. Int is amazing for a Heavy Weapons build due to Stabilized, Explosives, and Gunsmith. More if you want easier PA maintenance and less Fusion Core weight. You likely need more than 8 int in such a build.
---
SIR i have 40 BULK GEARS i run T-60 cheapest repair that requires only aluminum, plastic and steel. I have an issue....
---
I had to kill a player for the first time last night (and I have three level 50+ characters) because of a TSE shotgun troll at Whitesprings. Two of my low level friends were exploring the club when they found someone's camp right next to the building with all the ghouls in. A high level player came barreling out of the camp and started shooting at my teammates.......he didn't expect me to vaporise him with an explosive LMG.
---
Those shotguns are cool and all, but the ever-increasing number of duped TSE weapons means that griefers are steadily getting their hands on them.
---
Saw this level 7 dude gave him a really good sniper, half the ammo I had, a power armour frame and some fusion cores
---
[https://imgur.com/KDMBitP](https://imgur.com/KDMBitP) This is how we do it now. We have all the items listed out in dropdown. You can type in those fields to search for an item and select it!
---
I feel like I was making valid points, whether you agree with them or not. I pointed out its fallout multiplayer, and a lot of people in previous games enjoy being a raider. Its obvious they will want to play a raider in 76 as well. Who are you to complain about how other people want to play this game? The only person who apparently doesnt want to have a real conversation is you. 
---
&gt;  I disagree with you therefor you must be a troll and exactly like the person I am complaining about
---
What a mature, grown up attitude and view of other people. Its gonna take you far in life!
---
Also just for your information, I do not play as a raider. If anything its more of a bounty hunter type thing I do, and thats rare since I dont see bounties on servers often.
---
I guess I should add: for PS4
---
lol
---
Thank you so much dead droppers! I ran into a drop I found in the overseers box. Much needed rations and plans for better weapons. Was having a rough go up until then. Currently building up my camp to be able to pay it back to the community and make some dead drops of my own so thanks for the drop spot ideas
---
"Powering Up" power plant events but only if you don't have all the generator plans. 
---
spent 4 hours tonight on the same server (4 nukes and was stable!) held a workshop for 2 hours and other than one jackoff trying to steal my stuff when I died on the last Queen (only time I died, I agro her allot...) it was a great night!
---
Find one or two good people, keep them on your friends list and keep building a community.
---
Does it? Been trying to find dupers. Ran across a lvl 3 and lvl 160 something in the middle of nowhere with a chem station and stash box. This possible duping? If so anyway to screw with it or steal their stuff?
---
If you believe and clap really hard and fast they should light up
---
I don’t know if you have it or not but to help with that problem try getting the perk that takes away your radiation during the day. Then you can sell most of your radaway. I only keep about 10 of each type on me. Then whenever you need more you can just go back to whitesprings kill all the ghouls then your back to having a ton of them again.
---
hope it was a good night!
---
In true bro fashion, they gave their best stuff to a friend in need. Truly Legen—— dary. 3 stars, would kill again.
---
Don't know where you get your facts from, but it is Johnny. Although he was born just J. R. Cash. Just check his albums. I own several. I suppose you don't.
---
And jamesallenrogers comment was much more relavent to the OP's post than our little argument. 
---
Not sure what your hangup about Christianity is, but the people that wrote the Bible weren't the same ones going around killing others. That came later. But don't let facts get in the way of your diatribe. You're kind of similar to the religious in that way, at least from this athiest's point of view.
---
You shouldn't disregard the book either. It's good to have knowledge of considering that millions of people you live beside believe it's the word of God. It may help you understand them better even if it is a fairy tale that rips off judaism, zoaroastrianism, and Mesopotamian myths.
---
And I find it interesting that you hold these beliefs but seem to enjoy the music and lyrics of a very devout  Christian man. Hell, he was good friends with Billy Graham. Someone who I imagine you would despise based on your comments. Why no spout the hate for him and his music, or did you not even know where that lyric came from?
---
A lot of cognitive dissonance going on here.
---
Thirdstorm, and love the IGN
---
In fo76, when it comes to the team invites their mic comes thru your speakers if you have chat set to auto. Or set to team. 
---
Now if your just talking about a regular party invite thru your system itself and not the game. I would never accept those from a random or even someone on my friends list That I don’t really know. I can see how that would get annoying.
---
"Best and brightest," my ass
---
From my experience, Lucky Break doesn't trigger for PA
---
100% agree, there is a curve table, it's why one person spec'ed insanely can kill her, but 20 can struggle,
---
I love Pain Train (and since Fallout 4). You run into a group of enemies and you hear a *donk* sound as you run past themand it does damage. Its only really works once on an enemy so you run into them then start killing them afterwards. It can be used on the same creature multiple times but there is a time delay between when you can actually do it . I find it useful and fun to use at Whitesprings on hordes of ghouls.
---
They dont always fall down and sometimes it just does damage, obviously the higher your perk is the most times it happens.
---
The obvious thing to keep in mind is you need to not be overweight so you can actually sprint and you do need at least a little bit of a run up.
---
As one of the other comments mentioned though you do need to be careful when around friendly robots at whitespings or the bunker because if you literally bump into someone it's the same as shooting at them then you are in trouble.
---
Sometimes I forget I have it on.....
---
What's the risk involved?
---
At what level did you find it? I'm only 99 so maybe that has something to do with it
---
I enjoy Mr. Messenger.
---
To be honest there's most of the wanderers out there are pretty cool. I've only encountered one hostile person in the last three weeks
---
1.5k caps for the plan?
---
ts Pipe pistol most of the time just tagging and moving on, but the moment i see a hammer-bro at whitesprings riding my coat-tails, its full auto tse, I dropped the nukes, I invested the time, he watched a youtube video and made a cookie cutter 1 shot build thats fine, I will be the king Ledouche.  
---
Imagine if it was double shot haha
---
“Accident”
---
Heavy weapons mutant build here. Generally when I see the club spawn, I do a quick strafe across the enemies with a two shot 50 cal. The increased spread (additional projectiles deviate pretty severely at times) actually means less damage per enemy, and I tag everything without killing it. The weapon is also good if I'm overwhelmed, because it CAN kill fast if I need to.
---
Someone I was playing with got a furious black powder rifle
---
Nice. Thx.
---
Damn that sucks, you got ripped pretty hard. That thing is worth about 1.5 k
---
Yes have that perks it works well and now that you mention it typically only need 40 for a Nuke zone so thanks for adding another aid item i can use in my daily vendor rounds !
---
Literally ass fucks you?
---
Do you know what "literally" means?
---
Well that explains it. Grab x01 for less rads + the perks for 200% power armor repair and less materials used (can't think of the names sorry) and you'll be cheering. Plastic is a precious commodity for me, always empty on it
---
Love it!
---
THIS. THIS so hard!
---
Have my camp hidden away right on the edge of the map and regardless of however many platforms I build I get dropped directly into the river. There’s so much space on land, please god stop telling me I’m risking waterborne disease and pop me on the rocks.
---
Someone even commented on here that fast travel mats were still a thing and available in misc. I got so exited (I’m a sad person) 
---
I was wondering this myself the other day.  Perhaps there is a rare recipe for making royal jelly out of honey?
---
Fun fact with the right perk flamers can heal teammates lol
---
So....Fallout76seconds? 
---
No problem, will be done again
---
With a perk or two, its range is only limited to how far your PC can render the enemy. Better sniper rifle than every sniper rifle in the game. 
---
Pretty sure Bethesda is already watching the videos.   What better way to find out all the negative things possible about the game?  That is really what you want to know when delivering a product/service.  So you can try and remediate/fix those things or at least address them in some way.
---
Yes but I want the ability to get reassigned so that I can be the super mutant kin I fell that I am.
---
I also thought it was a reasonable assumption. Now, I'm stuck with my stupid account name. 
---
And diaper rash makes it cranky. 
---
They come in magazine promo packs. Use the perk to hear a noise when you're near one... I went from finding like none to finding them all over thanks to that perk. 
---
It's funny how RNG works. Whereas you only just got an explosive weapon drop, I got an explosive double capacity LMG very early after release (from a random legendary in an event, probably Guided Meditation). I subsequently built a third character around the weapon. 
---
Though I haven't had a single other explosive weapon drop as of yet.
---
Honestly dude if you bought it off r/bazzar it’s probably a dupe. Not saying your responsible or that theres any real 100% way of knowing. But whatever it really doesn’t matter....But what really does matter is this, Do you use your TSE for pvp
---
The servers are really stable (IMHO) when people aren't duping.. 
---
I just spent 5 hours on the same server, 4 nukes went off (3 then pause) and it was buttery smooth till the end.
---
Yes, u/ReysTampon, I sure do.
---
Yes, I flag it and pick up everything flagged.  I just use way too much bulking because tend to pick up many things and get extra of stuff that came with those many things.    So I use up about 100 plastic every time I play.   I think this is mainly because I started visiting all faction vendors every day to try and get some traveling money... I recently went on spending spree to try and get plans.
---
The exact reason I don’t believe you aren’t trying to troll is you try to make personal jabs at me at the end of every message I say to you. I only ever stated how you act in game yet you try to demean me after every thing I said. Again let’s recap how this played out. I vented my problem you then go and say how I must have issues and how immature I am. But like I said I do hope you have a good day and maybe learn to not be so spiteful just because you didn’t like that someone else didn’t enjoy something. I won’t end my message trying to bash you.
---
You'll get over it.  
---
Don't really use the tse unless someone else is taking my stuff 
---
Nah, when you get a good legendary, you will see it. Most of the time you get crappy legendaries that you won't even bother to mod even if your base weapon is just modded without any legendary effect. There's even legendary effects that basically does absolutely nothing, like "stalkers".(it has totally crap vats effect no one uses)
---
Today about a few hours from my comment I gave some level 9 some water, a gun that does a hell of a lot of a damage for level 5, and some stimpaks.
---
Yes. I’m working on a 2nd one now on an alt. There’s a ton of hidden challenges that come with it (wiring is the biggest issue) and as long as you keep the turrets under 20 and the Brahmin carts at a reasonable level you should be fine.
---
Also thanks all for watching, I probably as many hours into it as I did getting from level 1-100
---
It still has its issues but it is a fun game. If you can wait I’d maybe try holding off maybe a month to let them fine tune it just so you won’t have to deal with much. But if you don’t mind playing with minor bugs I’d say go ahead and give it a go.
---
It was worth buying at release. But yes, there's been numerous updates and patches that have drastically increased stability and performance since the beta. 
---
Oh yeah, did the Patrol event at the Penitentiary for the first time, reward was the Handmade plans. Level 205 as well, so that's not level locked.
---
300+ hours in and I've not seen one. 
---
That’s reassuring, I’ll consider getting it in maybe a month or so to see if any progress is made on the game.
---
I haven’t played for a bit, but unless they changed it, that perk absolutely does work. 
---
The plan is to sell the feature in the Atom Store no doubt. I'm only half joking. 
---
It smacks of either laziness or the rush the game was released that we see people's account names. Heck you could say its not even a very good security feature as i know now the log in name of everyone i play with and just have to guess their password.
---
Yes, I was going with the "other" connotation here...
---
Thanks for the reply, it's pretty  baffling for me to see so many people complaint about things they don't understand and not seeing how much effort were put into them, I was also very disappointing when they announced that Fallout 76 will not be single player game,but I understand that lots of people want an online Fallout game that I just accept that this game is not for me and hope we will get another Fallout game soon.
---
Question for anyone that owns it. Does it add protection like the space suit and hazmat?
---
This is great, I'm lvl 99 and always try to just wound enemies when others are around, then go look for flux haha.
---
Glad to hear you met the good ones. 
---
On a separate note I can't for the life of me figure out how to get my Xbox one headset (default one that came with the Xbox one elite I believe) to work.  I plug it in and it says it's plugged in on the Xbox home screen, but nothing works in game.  Is there something in game I need to do to activate it?  Any help would be much appreciated and save me from all the texting I do with others. 
---
Wow.  I thought the dragon was bad.  Is there a quad dragon?
---
Just got it again. I’m talking about vendors not events. That was the original way to earn it. 
---
Is it really as unenjoyable as many people say it is?
---
I enjoy watching the radstags, cats (house cats, tabby cats and black cats) drinking water from the pond at the back of my house. They don’t seem to mind the chug of the generators powering the purifiers. 
---
Very good stuff if RNGjesus smiles upon you.
---
Are the behemoths at twin lakes?
---
there ARE crashes not as many as launch but some I am on XBOX one X. Other then that I have in my at least 150 plus hours of gameplay  have not experienced a bug so bad or game breaking i quit. If you get addicted to the looting crafting. and hoarding aspect of the game then yes i would say you will enjoy it. Story is eh. But for me it's the quest of getting better Power armor. cool paints and of course all those lovely chems. 
---
Totally this 
---

You became thier mayor, and much like any mayor, you can attack them now without consequence.
---
If you do anything slightly impressive or have any cool item in an online game you are a cheater or hacker.
---
I'm a terrible level 80 player with crappy stuff and  always running out of ammo (keeping them for Scortchbeast queen) but still going to nuked Whitespring. There I've found people storing stuff on a white trash bin close to the golf and the tennis courts.
---
Thank you so much.
---
Btw: I just salvaged all my hardened mass... Again...
---
As long as  you are responsible with your TSE shotgun then I don't care. Just don't use it in whitesprings. Don't even pull it out if you are near someone in the Whitesprings area as it is incredibly annoying when you can't get any kills, get killed while on passive because explosion, or you just making the bodies fly all over the place for those trying to loot the bodies. 
---
Never ever seen Assaultron Dominator in the game except for this one place.  I have seen Level 45 Assaultrons, around, of course.  But those have been no issue really.   Its this one particular one.
---
It's not about takong it "too seriously".
---
Most of us are casual gamers, we get a few hours a week to play and enjoy the experience.
---
I shouldn't have to reconnect to a server every 45mins because some little fucker decided he/she wanted 100 shotguns and nuka colas, because they're either too mentally impotent to play like everyone else, or they think they can get rich quick by extorting people's desire to reach the end-game.
---
Taking it serious isn't even a bad thing anyway, Bethesda WANTS us to get involved and create a world, to build a society and organize things amongst ourselves, it's the basic premise of the whole game.
---
So in all fairness, leave us to it and find something else to do with your time. :)
---
At first I thought you where asking for this because of the state of the game.
---
morgantown highschool in the newer starting area server hop out front until you find plastic pumnking iside the starting entrance loot everything and you get about 150 each time
---
What is so good with unyielding armor? I saw a streamer and every single piece he was using was unyielding.
---
Usually stick to the Tesla when we do the loop around nuked white srpings that way I can actually get everything hit 
---
After tonight I can tell you there definitely is an issue. I noticed it repeatedly while fighting sb and sbq. They were flying so definitely nothing in the way. I also wonder if it is related to the two shot vats miss issue. The thing I'm thinking might be causing both is not waiting for the recoil/bolt/reload animation to complete before firing. In the heat of the moment I didnt think to be careful and pay attention to if that was it.
---
You mean like a work shop? Idk man I just think TSE are way to powerful and take the whole fun out of pvp. 
---
Imagine you catch a guy trying to take over your workshop. Sure you could just kill him with the tse in 1 hit. But it really takes out the magic of having a good old fashion shoot  out. 
---
It’s time to tuck the TSE away in the stash box.
---
Yeah there are a lot of situations where you even get bounty for nothing.
---
Best that happened to me (And kind of ruined my immersion forever), was in Watoga.
---
Nuke carrier flies in. I try to slap it out of the sky with my gatling, suddenly the nearby playerbase turrets shoot at me for no reason at all. (Probably somethign to do with the vertibirds, but i am not sure) And just as i look down i already had a 10 cap bounty.
---
Not even an hour later. I were farming some legendary bots. Suddenly 2 players popped in. I knew what they were after and always fired at my feet with their explosive weapons. Pissing me off already enough, since i don't have luck with anything lately. The other one already taunted me running up in my face, posting the heart emote, until the other one started to shoot at me. 
---
Why it ruined my immersion? He clearly was attacking me. Even the message for attack was there. So i turned around and thrown in 2 fatman nukes. Didn't even scratch him one bit. But he was dead center. (This was after the explosive weapons fix) 
---
Still fighting for the last bit of health i had, i popped Stimpaks and tried running off to safety. Not even 15 minutes later someone else popped in, shot the car right next to me and i died, bounty over. 
---
So in short, my immersion got ruined in two ways. I get a bounty out of nowhere for doing nothing and weren't even able to defend myself properly against the attackers. 
---
Hey, I didn't look up a damn thing.  Some of us just like hitting shit with big fucking hammers...lol.
---
I've been melee since BETA day one, and like hell am I gonna stop wading through nuke zones now because some TSE n00b thinks his shit stinks less than mine.  =P
---
Which part are you stuck on? It's a pretty lengthy process.
---
Yes.
---
Its not only low level players either. Ive have a couple of lvl 80-115 do it too. I can understand the low levels doing it because they probably dont understand the mechanics.
---
Don't be a DICK. 
---
Someone probably sold it to the vendor.  Provably low level versions.
---
ok cool sadly i am not computer savvy so can't read actual game script for confirm since i wanna make it comprehensive.
---
*"how the fuck did I even end up with 14 plasma cores!?"*
---
*"Why TF are they 400lb each!?"*
---
Try a cloud gaming service?  I've seen a few with Mac OS clients.  
---
This 2 hour session was free of lag or disconnects 
---
This has been an issue, and is getting worse. We had a guy literally handing out tse handmades/shotguns to every  player that came his way, hoping to force a fix from devs, now those guns, or variants of them are posted in the marketplace, asking for caps, or real money.  
---
IDK how to solve this problem, besides and comprehensive server wide character wipes, but good luck telling that to the community.  Would we keep playing the game knowing it was fixed, but had to start from 0'
---
When I completed that quest it didnt give me the power armor station plans. Dont know why, but my game probably glitched 
---
Check your Xbox setting are running at 1080p or 4K if you have the capability!
---
Chaotic good??
---
I’m on PS4, and you’re probably on another platform which won’t allow me to get that beautiful piece of machinery lol Thank you though for trying 
---
I have been coming across nothing but events that involve mannequins, from mannequins with vases of plants at their feet, to mannequins surrounded by dead brahmins. Just freaky.
---
Let’s drop some fucking nukes bois 
---
Lol @ ‘ultrawide’ UI
---
Jesus take the wheel.....
---
Mine is much much worse. I've never killed myself, but I've also never killed anything with it either. Fired 6 rounds and I don't think I even hit anyone. 
---
Thanks so much! I’m gonna check this out. Really appreciate it. 
---
In that same encounter those robots have a westworld reference. One of them says “It doesn’t look like anything to me”
---
Happened to me too.  It seems to reset if you don't finish it in one fail swoop.  I am not quite sure if its on a timer or what, because I was booted from server in the last area and I could continue upon restart.
---
Go back to the first area you find the transmitter and see if it begins by listening to the transmission etc.
---
Fun mission though.
---
Every game has bugs. I see you like Smite, did you know that game has bugs too?
---
Shielded raider underarmor +3agi ... birdbones mutation +4agi ... whatever legendary armor +1agi per piece. You can get shadowed mod so you are harder to detect in dark..
---
I have all armor pieces witch ap regen, 23agi, and using 4\* machete to stab everything. If i get spoted, i stand up and crouch again. Doing Scorchbeast queen runs. In silo there is one part where you **must** have atleast hazmat if no PA. Queen depends on where you send nuke. If you make zone with edge on prime fisure site, you can do it without any rads, if some noob send it with prime fisure in center of zone, you need hazmat. There is no way to survive 7rads per second which is minimal without PA/hazmat.
---
Most train stations have suitcases or trashcans at them, they seem to be a bit more stable when dumping stuff.
---
Never worry about the baggie "disappearing" again ;)
---
The point of maximizing damage output with a build like this is do some massive damage on the queen :D
---
try checking out this build! i use the mutations of scaly skin and adrenal to increase damage output with my TSE handmade.
---

Here ya go
---
&gt; At night time with all the critter noises is sometimes a little spooky!
---
And the killer minivans. Those guys are assholes. 
---
add NPC's for the love of God, i'll start playing again the moment there is. 
---
If that's a plan mod then I haven't seen it at a vendor for a long time. I thought BoS and Shadowed were the plan mods and Reinforced, Polymer &amp; Fiberglass were the scrapping mods. Not sure though. Maybe one of those three was a quest reward.
---
It’s definitely it’s own experience. I have a few friends I play with and it’s really fun going around and exploring together. I know a lot of people have fun playing solo. There is definitely a lot of detail put into you just have to be willing to look past a really interactive story campaign. The good thing about this though is they want this game to last a long time so you can count on new stuff being added over a long period of time.
---
Not sure if this is a big deal or not but I am still able to duplicate power armor in my inventory.
---
It would seem like a great thing to do (I have lots of Excavator armor now), but that stuffs heavy yo!)
---
I’ll be on tomorrow. Fellow ps4 player but no mic. I’ve done a couple nukes solo and it ain’t bad imo. My ps4 tag is ThenThereWas-X-
---
I just avoid all people. Easy fix.
---
Problem is more right after it had gone live the first month was unplayable, armor and weapons would vanish or be deleted, skins and power armor suits would do crazy stretch and visual glitches, lag was abundant and made it impossible for certain boss fights along with a glitch that allowed players to infinitely copy things like nuka colas for unlimited caps.
---
And thats just to name a few, its got a decent bit better but overall still needs alot of work as many of the bugs shouldnt have made it past alpha stage let alone a beta an onward.
---
My legendary coward super mutant actually said “run away!”  I did not expect that.
---
Maybe it was a plan mod, I know I learned it I learned the BOS mods so maybe I’m confusing it for those plans. Guess I’ll start scrapping
---
This changes everything. No more cat bowls for me
---
I am willing to agree with you on this point and save myself all the effort of collecting leather/cloth some more.   I'm still hitting all types of vendors looking for this one mod.
---
The very ironic thing about this game is the armors are all messed up.
---
The very cheapest armor in the game is also the strongest, physical and energy resists.  Not sure the numbers are fully accurate, this is from my fallible memory.
---
Heavy Combat armor Legs = 33/33 (At best mod and 200% durability)
---
BOS Combat armor mod gives like 40/37 or something; says +25 rad resists but never seen that work.
---
Heavy leather Legs with studded mod: 45/77 (200% durability).   I think the numbers are 37/66 at normal 100% durability.  If you really needed to, can add lead mod as well and get +10 rad resist, but I prefer +10 weight carry.
---
I never seem to get attacked by players,  I didn't know camps were vunerable.  Its normally some idiot mole rat or mutant silently knocking a wall in while I am playing the steel guitar.  
---
Of course there was this one time it was a GOD DAMNED Mothman!  What the hell is that all about?  What the hell I do to him?!
---
I enjoy the game and honestly i think they have implemented an interesting and comprehensive crafting system that really people have only scratched the surface of. But honestly the people i feel are most pissed are people who sadly can't make friends and and can't experience appalachia with people, they wanted "MUH FALLOUT 5" so they could roleplay as their own god complex character.
---
Nuka Cola is clearly trademarked and heavily guarded. 
---
........make it mission impossible to get it!!!! 
---
No he didn't.  That was the going price before mass duping.  They sell all the time now for 4-5K.
---
He's not Oxhorn because I'm Oxhorn
---
Is there a way to put in requests for certain weapons or quick search for such? 
---
“Don’t be a dick”
---
TSE weapons are fine, just switch to something else so everyone gets a tag in on the legendary enemies. Use whatever weapon you want but share the loot when it comes people. :)
---
That would be awesome. It would also be awesome if it wasn't just limited to parties. With a lot of players one shotting enemies, it's a little frustrating when you don't get the chance to tag a legendary enemy so you don't get loot or xp. It should just be a proximity thing instead of a tagging thing. For example in the uranium fever event, if one player doesn't get the chance to tag one of the legendary miners, he doesn't get loot even though he was still participating. 
---
I have one I won't be on til tomorrow msg me on XBox RaezorZ EdgE
---
I think it's as long as the server is up. The server tracks all the items in-world, so as far as the logic goes, indefinitely?
---
Source: managed to stay on a server for 3 hours, and the ammo I dropped at a station was there each time I returned.
---
Omg please post the junk cost to rebuild!!
---
Must have been traumatic caughing up the 12 wood scraps to repair your CAMP.
---
What If he bought the gun on r/fo76bazaar ?
---
Tse shotty doesn't mean hes a duper.
---
I feel a lot of the hate is bandwagon hate. Yes the game had a lot of issues the first week but so many big youtubers and gaming sites just completely shit all over the game so now even thought it has improved a lot since release people refuse to give it a chance themselves. 
---
Good idea. And if that doesn't work or is not possible to implement somehow then make it so the player is kicked if transferring x-amount at a time. Or so somehow slow transfer time down.
---
This appeared in South Park very soon after the game came out. Made me chuckle.
---
I thought the loot was unique to everyone who participated in the kill.  But honestly I fight mostly for experience anyways
---
It stacks big stat bonuses, nonsensically, at lo health.
---
lvl315, 500+hr, pipe rifles for life. Sure you didn't look it up, like I did't use reddit for nuke codes. If your one shoting the bloaters, no-one gets the xp/loot it's inconsiderate of others, like taking all the parts of power armor just for the scrap metal when other players still need parts, or the armor itself. 
---
That said it's a sandbox game so do as you see fit, but we are all in it together, let everyone tag the pinata before you hulk smash it.
---
I leveled another character to 15 and it took 21 server hops. 
---
What if the enemy is using TSE aswell?? (90% of the time they do)
---
A general overview:
---
1. Shoot down a cargo bot for a nuke keycard. It has to be one of the random ones and not one spawned for q supply drop req.
---
2. You can take the long way and get 8 code pieces for 1 silo and use the decrypt thing. I would recommend just looking on reddit or Google for the silo codes for the week.
---
3. Go to the silo you want to launch from and go down the elevator.
---
4. Follow the quest markers and instructions given to you as you move through.
---
5. Fire nuke
---
If you need help with step 4, you're better off having someone run through it with you once with a mic or googling it.
---
And I'll never ever do it again!
---
Sorry on PC.
---
Maybe we use the 'trade' emote? But just look down or crouch instead, begin dropping stuff once they give us a thumbs up?
---
Yeah the depth at which we need to go into is long. Long and short   
---
step 1. Join enclave.
---
2. Compete Enclave Story Line
---
3. Look up where a nuke keycard is in newly unlocked area, and then decipher nuke code. 
---
Which terminal do you try it in?  It is used in a few terminals. I have had times where the whole mission has disappeared and the master tape didn't work (or I couldn't reboot anything at Abbies.)  The only way I could resolve this was log out and in again.
---
I'm using borderless windowed now and haven't had a problem, other than leaving world from social menu is a CTD........... Full screen does exactly what you described *shrugs*
---
This will be downvoted but I agree to an item wipe, I mean, I'm level 230 and everything I got I got it grinding, now it worths nothing because the duped items, so I don't have anything else to lose, I've already lost.
---
&gt;some food friends
---
Ahh, I see you selected the Cannibal perk too!?
---
Wasnt hiding from it. Was my first time wanted and didnt understand it at first. I went about my business waiting for somebody to hunt me down but it never happened. 
---
Where my shock came was that I was still wanted a day later. I didnt realize being Wanted carried with you until justice was served. 
---
Have you tried one? They’re kinda fun. Pull a trigger here, something explodes over there. :)
---
Well yea of course.... and thats where the problem lies everybody has them now. I wish Bethesda would just get rid of them it would really bring back good pvp matches
---
Some vendors are shared cap pools. I think there are seven you can go to around the map so 1400 caps total. However if you get to one that should have a full 200 caps to buy but reads as 0, just sell them a bobby pin or something cheap and there cap inventory will reset back to 200.
---
Right there with ya buddy. I see people who’ve rushed to level complaining that the game has nothing to offer them now that they’ve launched a nuke or two. 
---
I’m still only level 25 after quite a lot of play time - I spend a lot of time tinkering with my camp or wandering round exploring.
---
It level lock with Vendors selling it for some reason. Somewhere between levels 15-25. After you are over 25 the plans don’t seem to spawn at Watoga Vendors or Harpers Fairy. Though for some reason Grahm can still have it in his inventory for some reason.
---
So after the level 25 vendor cap. They only way to get from events Uranium Fever and the Patrol one at the prison. Seems to be a bug with seeding of Vendors for small reason that hasn’t been patched.
---
This is one of the reasons I've quit the game for now (until issues like this get fixed -- among many others). 
---
This is quite common I find many high levels will always try to help out the lower, and I notice most of the time the lower levels will be scared of them just cause the level.
---
I thought we just hated golf. 
---
I am not much higher at 37. I am enjoying the game. It feels like I am advancing at a good pace. However I do miss being able to pick up any weapon at any level like in the SP versions. I had gone out and discovered and explored every POI in the first biome now I am following the primary quest line and seeing a little of this and that to come back to! 
---
Yup also got that one. Quite funny, I love weird stuff like that.
---
I’ve wondered about something similar to that also. My base used to be in an area that didn’t see much action. If I ever did see an enemy they were almost always alone and a low level so I never had to worry about defending my base or needing turrets. But a couple days in a row I would log in and shortly after a SB just lands right next to my base and starts shooting me. Next day I’m in a world and there were 3 of them flying nearby. They weren’t attacking me but were uncomfortably close. It just weirds me out because they would have to travel a long way from the nearest fissure to get to my base.
---
You *monster*
---
Noice!!
---
I crafted a full set of the toughest lvl 1 leather armour, with shadowed/ studded/pocketed options. Dropped it for a lvl2 guy directly outside the Vault.
---
I really hope he tells all his friends that some crazy clown with a huge head and machine gun helped him stay safe in his first few hours!?
---
[https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-nuke-codes](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-nuke-codes)
---
what system you on im on XBOX1 . But yes that place is great for plastic search everywhere.
---
This particular one was not the normal assaultron (red beam), this one right there was nutz.  I was level 91 with low rad resist and this thing tore me apart within 1 second.   The thing fired this bright white rapid AoE thing very very fast.  
---
I was thinking  that maybe it was some radiation gun or something but I did not take any radiation increase... just lost health faster than fighting the queen while being naked.
---
My friends give me a lot of grief about this but half the fun of the game is dressing my character up in the weird outfits I find haha. So I also avoid Power Armor. Definitely makes the game more challenging but it’s in a way I enjoy.
---
Dying will reduce rad count if you are that desperate to keep marsupial, but starched genes is the only proper way to do it
---
&gt; It's not about taking it "too seriously".
---
It really is though, their is no framework in this game for an "economy."  There is no market board, skilled crafting, rarity or scarcity, challenge to leveling or raids.  You're just role playing that there is a reason to do this.  You can make a one shot build for everything but Scorched beast Queen's using a fucking golf club.  TSE weapons just let you do it with a garbage build.
---
Oh I wish I could afford something like this. I don't really like the design of the 3000, but I absolutely fell in love with the brutal, retro and simple style of the 2000.
---
Leave dmv
---
Die to rads
---
Well today I have dropped out a dozen times. I've given up doing poiseden power plant
---
"*10x .44 revolver rifles, comin' right up!"*
---
You encountered a few rotten apples, don't let that discourage you. In all my time playing I haven't been attached like this once.
---
Think of em as little kids and ignore it.
---
Ive nuked a few other area's like non prime fissures and Harpers Ferry. People turned up only to stand arround like is that it??
---
That's a nice place, fancy and functional.
---
Endgame balance is totally off the rails though sadly. Two shot explosive is a combination that really shouldn't even exist, but here we are. 
---
I recently reduced the ammo types I needed. A low level asked if I could spare .45 when I asked if he needed anything. I dropped about 900 rounds out of the 3k in my inventory. When I assured him it was all his he was ecstatic. He said he can't wait to be able to do the same one day.
---
That's weird I didnt experience any of that and I've been playing since day one  I recently lost my favorite weapon It vanished. But luckily the comunity helped me get another one for free even though I have a ton of caps. Also can we take a moment to stop giving dupers any more attention and talk about how amazing the community  is? 
---
Assuming you reached all the story points and a high enough level where you can reasonably do this,
---
1) Gather a nuclear keycard and all 8 code pieces for at least one of the silos before the weekly reset through the enclave nuclear room computer. The keycard is mandatory, but you can skip the code pieces by just checking [nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) for this week's launch codes. Otherwise, you collect all 8 pieces and use the decoder inside that same room (they look like ballot printers) to get the codeword used to unscramble the number order. 
---
2) Once you have a keycard and the launch code, find and enter whichever silo's code you have
---
3) Perform a bioscan; you have to find the room with tall pods and step into one to scan your biological data. Then find one of the many old blue ID cards sitting around the area. Find the little maintenance closet, clear the ID card, and use the terminal next to it to create your new ID. Then scan that inside the control room to allow entry into the next section.
---
4) Find a way to bypass the damaged generator room. The easiest way of doing this is hacking the level 3 computer next to one of the vault doors and telling it to ignore the alert. If you can't or don't want to do that, there is a lengthier part where you fix the damaged pipes and fight off more robots.
---
5) Destroy enough cores to overload the system. You can shoot them, but you can also just walk up to them and press e to take them down. There are more than enough around the area, so you can just destroy whichever are closest to you. They look identical to the star cores from nuka world for reference.
---
6) Replace the 15 cores in the storage room terminal to allow entry into the launch room. You have to remove the broken ones from the terminal, and you can either use a nearby tinker's workbench to repair them (iirc steel and copper required) or look around and find more. I think there are just barely over the 15 required hidden around the adjacent rooms.
---
7) Initiate launch prep. This is really just a defense quest where you have to prevent the protectrons from getting destroyed by a couple waves of other robots. If they are destroyed, you can have new ones fabricated, but that takes some time and your progress towards finishing launch prep is slower while they are not at their station.
---
8) Scan your nuclear keycard, put in the launch code, and choose an area of the map to nuke. This will give you some loot and start a 3-minute countdown before impact. You can either leave through a hatch to your left after you go back upstairs above the launch computer, or just fast travel out. The hatch has some loot though, and it leads you to an escape pod that takes you to some out of the way area close to the silo.
---
decontamination showers don’t remove them either 
---
&gt;  let’s say about 40 legendary in various locations over a couple of server hops
---
where can you find legendary enemies? i think ive only seen liek a couple my entire game.
---
Cool, good to know. I will share whatever I get anyway but it's always more fun if we both get stuff. 
---
Most people you meet aren’t going to be like this. Since most high levels are decked out in good Power Armor and extremely strong weapons. There isn’t really anything you can build that can stop other players. Only thing I can suggest is if you do see people griefing you just hop worlds.
---
I can respect that.
---
And suitcases in train stations are pretty common also, easy to spot, and everyone can have a pilfer.
---
That is probably the case if I *could* get that Blade of Bastet, but I cannot.  The quest line is broken for me and I cannot progress in it.
---
Order of Mystery: Novice is broke for me.  
---
I cannot abandon the quest, I cannot restart it, I cannot continue it.
---
I'm at the point where supposed to log into crypto to research the 3 items, but I am unable to log in.  No logins appear on the crypto terminal.
---
I don't know, but I consider it equivalent to FO4's raiders that attack your settlement. For me it feels like part of the game, in a sense.
---
This is a huge qol complaint for me! I want people to see my camp from the best view when they travel to my camp
---
Dont know my hours in yet, but I just hit level 77 and got my first explosive weapon. It's not a 2 shot, just a zealots explosive 10mm. 
---
I didn't found any app, but I admit, I was thinking about this idea since one week after the release. This game really need something like this.
---
If they have a bounty leave it to the bounty hunters, people like that are rare but very little can be done at that massive level gap. If they get a bounty the problem might even take care of itself
---
I only whip out my TSE if the enemy has a tsE and using it. Especially those TSe lmg users that jst jump around and spray the damn thing wishing to hit their enemy.
---
Yes bro, you got the point, this is not a post AGAINST people using TSE, its a post to let everyone know they can put away perks to lower the damage and let everyone tag monsters instead one-shooting them, it doesn't exclude anything in particular, but as far as I know the only are one-shotting things are TSE weapons so..
---
It's like... reverse Doomsday Preppers!
---
Don't worry about it man. You can farm mutations later, and people are selling serums for around 500 nowadays and it will only get cheaper in the future.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
I certainly wouldn't recommend levelling another character to 15 for this reason alone. So much easier to earn the 1200 caps to buy from another player (or whatever the going rate is for consoles).
---
They were fighting Vertibirds at the shooting range, thats how i killed them, i went into the range where they could not reach me, for a while, there was a workbench and ammo vendor there too, I went through all my guns and ammo, I am only level 38, and when I died by the time I respawned the level 15 who was hiding out nearby, took my junk! So I could not repair :(
---
I gave away a lot of those weapons also. I’m not a duper. Got an inventory of guns from another player and duper. I did it as a Christmas giveaway on my twitch stream and also because I found out most people on all this Market Sub Reddit’s all are in groups.
---
In these groups and clicks they dupe stuff. They then try to sell it for high market value. They also try to control and manipulate values of items and weapons. Then I found out they use multiple accounts to sell stuff on reddit. Then go around complaining about dupers when they was the origami dupers.
---
But because of what I did I’m labeled a duper now. I will post the whole story in and edit if people want to read it.
---
You can accidentally get a bounty. For example, throwing moltovs in the wrong camp after someone else kills you. Totally an accident. 
---
I promise. 
---
Ok now i'm starting to see a correlation in all AP REGEN and SPRINT speed PERKS, It seems since you can get power armor MODS for almost all these sometimes with different effect IE Kinetic Dynamo restores AP on hit, while dodgy Reduces AP for no damage.
---
Will probably move soon but that damn terrace near the river makes it hard
---
If you want to build up a supply make a bunch of healing salves. It's cheap and easy to make. You can give it away or use it yourself to help build up your stimpack supply.
---
I thought that story line was pretty awesome.
---
Random event.
---
Sure! On the homepage (after you select your system) there is a search bar you can use. Also, for browsing you can click any of the buttons right below that.
---
I have a Stalker's Dragon that is pretty beast in my stealth sniper build.
---
I think they nerfed that corpse.  Its always full now.
---
Man this happened to me today. I encountered a high level and just froze. I wasn’t sure if I should just bail and run for my life or see what they do, but they emote me to come closer and I find a bag with a shit ton of ammo and some sweet ass weapons. Dude (or chick) just hops away like no big deal. 
---
I was literally wandering for a good ten minutes without any ammo and this person made me feel so good about playing the game. Of course there are the assholes out there trying to fuck with low levels, but damn is there an overwhelming amount of solid players just looking out for one another. 
---
I don’t use a mic (gasp), but one guy took the time to try and motion me to follow him and he led me to my first power armor set. 
---
Fuck this game is good.
---
I am on PC.
---
Its a random event in the whole. Happens too have certain spawn points. Another one is a respeonder eyebot that gives a location on the map with Morse code. They are quite cool and rare though.  Good find ^^ 
---
Rng is fun
---
Not a duper. But that crap ruined the market. When I started trying to sell mine, that was the going price. Now they are selling them for dirt cheap, 500 caps sometimes. 
---
I'm holding out until after the banning begins for those ass hats. 
---
Let's face it. Whoever added TSE's to the game in the first place has ruined the game. The only fix is to increase enemy levels and phase the gun out of existence 
---
Nope. I remember seeing a joke post about them not giving a screw around launch
---
Sadly no. Ps4
---
The patch must be working, because I freeze a little, expecting a crash, then I keep going, makes me cheer out loud.
---
If someone low level says they are shooting for a particular build I will give them high level pieces to look forward to. A medic dragoon isn't super op but in the eyes of a person in their 20s it becomes a goal.
---
Oh yea, or do like me, I filled my Samsung Music with songs like Butcher Pete, 16 Tons, Mister Five by Five, Uranium Rock, Big Iron, Right Behind Your Baby, Blue Moon, Mr Sandman, The Wanderer, and man, oh my god, that's really a lot of Fallout
---
XB1 too. Same GT as name here
---
wow! That's interesting &lt;3 I remember Rdr online was amazing and so fun; Haven't gotten to rdr2 online yet
---
1k Atoms for it
---
What does this mean?
---
Mate, we all have duped items, and it is ok, that is why I agree with an item wipe.
---
Cheers!  I was server hopping west bridge but it never had the leg I was missing. 
---
I thought you were gonna say an apology from the Devs. In that case it will come free for 300 atoms which is a steal cause it was originally 1000 before it came to market.
---
I found out that chest has a weight limit. It didn't like me trying to stuff a couple Fatmans in it.
---
I moved today, I wish I could have more than one camp, there are two other spots I want to build in, one I keep losing, and when I find it again, I don't have the caps to move.
---
It comes with MIRV mod, I had to remove it because I could not get it to work well.  I had to overshoot it so I did not get hit and oddly enemies standing next to the explosions did not seem to mind either.  After putting the standard one on it, seems I can at least aim better and enemies hated me for it.
---
You might consider posting it somewhere where people expect to read more and you have more options for formatting and links. Maybe Medium or something like that? Might also make a good long form YouTube video. 
---
THIS!
---
Having an explosive shotgun and 400 stimpaks is NOT having a good time.
---
I use the .50cal machine gun, and it's PITIFUL with my current perk setup, but damn is it satsfying to watch the health bar trickle downward as I empty 250 rounds at a time into a Scorchbeast!
---
*Insert 'Excuse me what the fuck' meme here*
---
Just replace the MIRV with standard and it becomes a way to rid yourself of 6 lbs \*and\* piss off some SMs...
---
Cool
---
inb4: someone says fo76 is glitch art
---
Since all the other players and encounters, I feel so lonely in Fallout 4 with just some NPCs
---
next time that happens, and nothing shows for you. give it about 60 seconds and check it again.. been noticing a load time difference between time of death and the loading of loot.
---
been several 3*s i know i have hit and damaged  to go check them and it show me an empty box but come back to the meat pile a minute or two later and check again and there is a full drop with legendary items in it.
---
had it happen to me several times with ghouls in whitesprings and on the scorchqueen as well.
---
This may be a good idea
---
Put a splitter mod on it and it turns into an insane auto shotgun but breaks before you use one core.
---
Did a fight actually start? If not then you might have been violating the NAP so you got it?
---
another bug I guess
---
yeah. that is fun I have to say I like to go to parking lots and make cars \*exploting sound\* xD
---
https://imgur.com/a/w3PJ6z4 updated
---
It's mostly useful to figure out which limbs to target to maximize damage. Some are not obvious (belly for deathclaws and protectrons)
---
Once you know them, you can just switch it out permanently 
---
I just add some one on Xbox friends who owns a workshop (since I guess he won’t leavr the server) and put my stuff in a box near my camp. Then I relogg my alt and join the same server. Risky, but works every time. 
---
Will buy
---
I finished the Excavator armour just 2 days ago. I deliberately leave the helmet off,
---
1- because it's feckin scary not being able to see anything in the dark!  
---
2- My gigantic Bobblehead stick out the top of the suit, and looks both stupid, and awesome!
---
Alright i work nights get off at 6AM chicago time so im on in the AM add me though i can help give you some tips on things.
---
It’s been crashing on my Xbox a lot recently too. It never used to as much and I’ve been playing since launch. 
---
https://youtu.be/UY_V_CBlzZ4 watch this to get the most recent version of my C.A.M.P.
---
Twin Shot Explosive. 
---
Two shot explosive shotguns would be doing that
---
You cant trade until you hit level 5. New players wont be able to buy off you fresh out of the vault. 
---
No. 
---
I agree we all have duped items. I don’t think a nuclear action of whipping inventories is good idea For Bethesda.
---
I believe instead they need Buff base gun damage. Buff some bad Melee Damage. Rework some perk cards. Also buff armor a little bit. Buff the explosive damage mod for armor.
---
Then start releasing level 50,55 and 60 Legendaries and add 4 Star Legendaries to pursue and to replace what’s out there.
---
Because I honestly feel a full nuclear whip of inventories will kill the player base to much at this point.
---
Also it’s a good thing now that the dupe bug is a thing. I rather have to deal with it now. I understand from source they have only been band aid fixing it because it a more complicated code bug to fix and is going to take a couple of months.
---
Because this will be the last Fallout for 5-10 years. This game will be ported over to PS5 and the next Xbox. They will be a lot of free content updates. There will be DLC’s and Expansions. Weapons will increase in Legendary Star ratings. Weapons will in crease in Level caps. As I believe our Special Stats will go for 50 to 60 probably in the next 4 months or so, and slowly increase over time.
---
But those are my thoughts.
---
Explosive, usually. You can also do Bloodied but it's more effort.
---
Unfortunately it does not. Purely cosmetic.
---
I just looked this up and apparently there is controversy over whether she was singing bucket or fuck it. I find her voice and the song adorable and quirky though.
---
TSE (Two shot explosive) pump action
---
Every shotgun damage perk
---
skeet shooter 
---
probably adrenaline and bloody mess as well
---
whatever else they need to survive
---
TSE shotguns in this game can do a lot of damage and even kill scorchbeast queens in only a few hits, they are pretty much the unstoppable meta of the game along with other TSE weapons. Fear them
---
Will do, I won't be on until sometime tomorrow. I'm in Aus, not too sure how our times work out
---
Known issue. Might get fixed in another two weeks if you're lucky. Would recommend swapping out the torso in the meantime.
---
Get all them Agility perks! Those pistol bonuses can stack up quickly.
---
And I enjoy having to check my ammo count every so often, making sure there's 6 in the cylinder!
---
Not helping dude
---
Any shotgun with explosive. Doesn't even have to be top level.
---
I know right, I was crouched in the long grass stalking a gulper, when all of a sudden it exploded and covered me in gulper guts. Some Power Armor guy comes along, loots the body and runs off. They say 24 folks per server, but 3/4 of them are basically the same person.
---
u/lonevaultwanderer
---
It seems to be 15-19. 
---
Yes just like harpers ferry
---
you need to leave servers and start again for some  reason there is a mutation cooldown on that server but once you leave and go do it again it should work
---
I found a "flatwood monster" yesterday and did the same thing, i hit him once and he vanished with a flash lol.
---
Yup, I had a flamer, with 20% damage reduction when mods are hit with it.    Used that often in Whitepsrings until ran out of fuel.  It uses it up too quickly.  But it did little damage and hits group very quickly.
---
Only issue with it: It said 228 range on it, but never went more than 20.
---
Yeah i’ve done! But don’t work, well, it works but not as it should !
---
No I wasn't even sure what happened yet since I was killing ghouls. I saw the bounty pop up and started looking around and saw the guy on the ground.
---
I have had them show up at Watoga at level 25 with an alt character before.
---
So can bloodbugs
---
Dm me we can figure somthing 
---
Oh like the Stalker's Rolling Pin that I keep finding from 3 star legendaries?
---
My problem with them is not only are people duping them but they're actually using websites to sell them for real world money which turns the game into "pay to win". The worst thing for any game in my opinion. I don't want to see this game turn into that. It's irritating. These guys don't deserve my real world money. Get a job scumbags! On a side note, why is every machine gun turret in game that isn't at a player camp an explosive variant? Like why are they all using explosive bullets? Seriously? I can't even find an explosive legendary gun anywhere but all the game world's gun turrets fire explosive bullets? What a bunch of ********!
---
I think something has changed to that corpse too.  I will put stuff in there, but when I come back on my alt, to do the same, all I see is the normal loot.
---
Under is the right way, so ehhh...
---
Tesla weapons are exceptional, but IMHO too heavy for their sub-par damage.
---
Really hope Bethesda actually pays attention and does some weapon rebalancing 
---
Still lighter than a flamer however 
---
Rad x and starched genes will prevent mutations, but other than that every 5 points of radiation has a chance to give you a random mutation (according to the fallout wiki) - I tend to get them when least expected like when I ate razorgrain soup or when three scorchbeasts murdered me (mutations persist beyond death). Once you get a desired mutation use starched genes to keep it, or used radaway to cure any unwanted ones
---
People really need to get it through their heads that two shot is not amazing for shotguns as it only adds one extra pellet.  
---
For what is it used then??
---
Same I mean when I log in there like 30 seconds of lag but no disconnecta
---
My account name is my email, I should get 2FA.
---
Also right up the hill from blackwater, the middle mountain cabins often spawns a raider power armor set.
---
That one extra pellet does the entirety of the dmg that the other pellets do.  So if you’re regular shotty does 500 dmg, that extra pellet will do 500 dmg as well.
---
So while not be good if you have bad aim, it’s still pretty amazing, especially with explosive 
---
Might be worth mentioning on the bug thread, since pacifist should make it impossible to even hurt other players like that
---
OK, so it's twoshot shotgun explosives I gather from the comments... What melee build do I have to make to compete, or should i just reroll/respecc? Because god damn, I get left in the dust constantly, farming XP at high levels when some glutton just eats it up with their shotty is a nightmare xD
---
I’m only level 10 but I will add you too. Name is nacho noodles. Really need friends. Game gets boring when you only play alone all the time.
---
Bless you kind sir 
---
Yeah it feels lonely playing alone. My wife kinda hated following me to do my quest but at this point I'm high level that I only do nukes and events with people from reddit. It's crazy we met on a post about asking for help for a team now we got our own faction/group. 
---
i have all 18, apart from herbavore cause i have the other, we had to server hop to get them, but i did it with a mate and we both just had rad sponge on and jump in take rads and loose rads from one another it was pretty easy to do
---
Just a thought, Maybe make yourself known to them?
---
If they're just grinding for resources, they'll be likely to cover you if you let them know you're on a mission.
---
I've personally shadowed 2-3 players under lvl 20, and I'm only lvl55 right now, but they've all really enjoyed a good tough fight with some tough enemies, because they know that I'll whip out the big boom-sticks if it gets too hairy!
---
Yeah. It happens when my friends are messing around but they never die so I didn't even know that was possible. 
---
If there's a crack or an open window all you need is something to lock on to with Vats. Get close press Q or whatever Vats is on console and you can port into nearby seemingly enclosed areas. 
---
My Wife uses it, it does work but only at the end of the 30 sec "DBNO" timer. And obviously, not everytime.
---
Not saying it's good mind
---
Not only is not being able to display character names stupid from a roleplay perspective, it's a security risk too. Always displaying your account name *and* no two factor authentication = how did this game get released in 2018?
---
That what I'm saying. If the wanted enemy has an explosive shotgun, you're fucked
---
I thought that might be the case. That's why I haven't bought it
---
Two shot is actually not that great on shotguns, as it just gives another pellet.. I have an instigating explosive one, it's great:D
---
oh and be naked!
---
Interesting. The level range seems to be jumping all over. I almost wonder if it's something that's pre-determined or something. 
---
We tried for a week at level 38 and 42 respectively. A lot of people seem to only get it from 15-19. 
---
/shrug. PD is quicker anyway. 
---
Oh ok. I'll keep it since I do like pvping sometimes. I'll just have to remember to get to a safe spot to turn pacifist off so I can actually defend myself.
---
Hey everybody, I found the FILTHY EVIL CHARACTER PLAYER.
---
 Two shot is actually not that great on shotguns, as it just gives another pellet.. 
---
From what I’ve heard reactive plates are considered “return fire” for pvp. Which is hilarious when they slap damage you, but your reactive plates return full damage based off his original damage and one shot him, but frustrating when you aren’t prepared for PVP (like you in pacifist mode). 
---
I’d call it a bug, but when they fix it is anyone’s guess
---
Serum prices on market are droping to 300caps each. It will be used as 1hour consumables soon. Way better than hoping you get your mutation and no another one from 17others.
---
I wouldn't know, haven't had any drop myself. Just TSE seems to be all the rage. 
---
An instigating sledge, wardrum, or something similar with swing speed or increased power attack is lovely.  So is Bloodied with the same secondary rolls.
---
Twisted muscles mutation helps a lot, as well as radicool and bloody mess.  Adrenaline is also useful in nuke zones as you tend to get attacked by groups of monsters 
---
Yeah I never seen them spawn at wotaga or Harpers Fairy after level 25. Only Vendor I know that can have them after level 25 is Grahm but very low chance.
---
Then the 2 Patrol events I mentioned earlier can drop them as rewards.
---
Two shot doesnt do that much.. All explosive shotguns are great though..    
---
Skeet shooter makes it allmost into a sniper as well, it's awesome.     
---
That said, i try to switch to a worse weapon in nuke zones, to let people tag.. 
---
I'm not hopeful for the fix. There's too many other that are more significant. And if I had to choose between that being fixed and a dlc, I'd take the dlc. I just wish it initiated pvp so I didn't get a bounty for being a murderer.
---
Can rad sponge cure mutations?  That would be not helpful not being able to control when your rads are being cured.
---
Careful on using the "Charge" for the tesla.  I crash my client all the time trying to charge that thing.
---
Me 4 plans in 7 server hops (lvl 15)
---
There’s a lot of spook lore about people jacking people’s stuff once accepting a trade invite or allow a peeky into their inventory. The caution isn’t unfounded, especially for low levels, but we all do thank you for paying it forward nonetheless 
---
I noticed the Plasma Gatling is missing the physical damage that the plasma gun has, if that was added in then maybe the Plasma Gatling would be a bit better. 
---
That's the ultra-rare Atom Cat paintjob.
---
Another pellet that does the full dmg of the other pellets together.
---
Still doubles the base dmg of the gun, just sucks if you miss with that one pellet.
---
Level is less the issue as damage. Don't bring your shit damage friends to fight SBQ. People that don't understand damage output and clear just ruin events. Same shit as Uranium Fever, events are great if people understand the goal and are willing to work with the people that work to complete them.
---
I dropped 4k worth of plans to someone yesterday.
---
Gave someone else the handmade rifle plans as well. He was lvl 13 iirc
---
I will also make some 10mm guns and hunting rifles if I have excess materials to burn. Fully moded as well to get max base damage out of them for the lvl I make them at. Usually lvls 5-10. And pass them out plus ammo for them to low levels
---
What they should actually do is make all those skill type perks passive instead so they're always on and you don't have to have them wasting valuable special points for no reason. It's absurd. Every other RPG has passive abilities including their own previous games. The perk cards are a cool idea because you can flip builds during gameplay but with that being said, they're immersion breaking. I don't want to have to remember what perks to swap out when crafting or questing. I shouldn't have to think about it at all. I should only have to really look at my perks when I'm choosing a new one at level up. The rest of the time they should be an after thought
---
Ultra rare I assumed, but from what&gt;?
---
hey that's how the lore would work we "both left the vault from different sectors he gave me water and we've been working together ever since. But really sounds fun i'm on XBOX 1 always love a fun playthrough exploring some new area so please if on same console hit me up
---
Taking rads faster make it seem more likely.  I used the steam vents in the toxic valley which provided +29 rads/s.  That seemed to be very effective.  I rarely had to bathe more than twice to get my mutation for that login.  Be careful of taking off starched genes too soon after your shower as the shower itself has a lingering effect of curing rads and may wipe out a mutation if you remove starched genes too quickly.
---
Install windows 10 via bootcamp. Works fine. 
---
They're stated as to not show up past level 44 at Harper's. But people like yourself say 25, others say 19. 
---
So I've no clue. It'd be nice to get a real answer. Unlikely though. 
---
Well, unless they're disabled againj
---
Ive only run into him during the event "path to enlightenment". At the end it spawns a friendly version of him and when you talk to him he gives you a 5% exp bonus that lasts for an hour.
---
Use stash boxes. It's like a connected storage device
---
I suppose fo76 is more supposed to be some kind of mmo with rpg elements...
---
Are you sure about this? I heard it just makes the pellets go from like 6 to 7, for a minor increase.. 
---
Yeah but thecscortch queen is a challenge  even with 13 people with tse it took us 14 minutes 
---
I honestly don't know.  It was data-mined, along with the Army OD Green pain job for T-60, and the Winterized White for T-51.  Then one day, some folks managed to get them...  I've seen maybe like 1 person of each.  I know the guy sporting the Winterized White paint... but he got it through Arafura's services.
---
100+ level doesnt matter. The level of the mob does. Bloated ghouls are lvl 68? You just need to be lucky to find *3 b ghouls. It takes a while rnjesus is a big pain in the ass for sure in fallout 76.
---
LOL. 
---
You still read his post and took the time to reply. 
---
If they only have a 10 cap bounty theres no way they did anything deserving of leveling their base, you're a far greater asshole than any "troll" you're pretending to bring to justice  then
---
Yep.  Naked or no rad resistance helps a ton.  You want to be taking rads as fast as possible.
---
No, Tongs do though 
---
They are in every train station and they are craftable from the start of the game
---
PvP flagging is broken.  Unless you're a sadistic griefer.  Then PvP flagging is working as intended.
---
Dying rad heal will also remove mutation without starched genes.
---
Yeah I enjoy the slow solo stuff.  I have hit level 56 now and I am wondering what to do though.
---
Yeah man gt is comanderjericho (I ran out of characters lawl
---
Very creative to post it in both subreddits.
---
Please let me know if you find anything interesting from it.
---
Positive, tested with my quad explosive pump and my TSE pump.
---
It does only add one extra pellet, you’re not wrong about that.  However,  that extra pellet will do the full dmg of the gun.
---
Say you have a combat doing 300 dmg with absolute no perks.  A TS combat will do 600 dmg, as the extra pellet deals 300 dmg rather than the split dmg the other pellets do.  Now, the extra pellet is not effected by perks I don’t believe.  But is still useful with explosive and whatnot. 
---
I have never had it happen after 25 from personal experience. Now how much of that can be bad RNG I don’t know. But looking that most people say 19 and the Fact 25 is only 6 levels higher. Seems very possible.
---
(Spawns in /u/thatguygreg ‘s face)
---
“Stop right there criminal scum!” 
---
Yes they do
---
It just works.
---
Yes they do. 
---
Some wanderers can't handle the wasteland.

I guess you're fishing for karma or drama? Since you posted the opposite on r/fallout.

[This was totally worth 1000 bullets](https://i.imgur.com/0vpJ1Is.png)
---
Damn!!!
---
Sorry the connection is so trash, I'm in West Australia, and I'll drop server, on average every 2 hours. 
---
It's tedious, but we sometimes get a warning, it'll freeze for a second, then disable controls 2-3 times, then we just stop what we're doing and wait the 20 seconds for the kick. Haha
---
Sad, but we're working around it.
---
I follow camelworks and mxr and the guy that does all the glitches I watch his stream and well they all still play the game and have mixed feelings about it. They havent really shit in the game just were honest it's a WIP game
---
I think there's a perk that heals rads during daytime.  I haven't used it or looked for it since I don't need it so I'm not sure what level it is. But like the other guy said, mutation serums are cheap.
---
We should shoot him in his knee 
---
Yeah. And then Bethesda will charge you separate atoms for them at the Atomic Shop. Just like they did with the cowboy hat and Western duster 😂🤣
---
Weirdest poem I’ve read all day 
---
Or maybe a vault dweller found Grahm.
---
That is actually really interesting information!  
---
But that also means there is still a bit of diminishing returns, as it's just an extra pellet exploding? Because that's what the majority of the damage comes from, not the base pellet damage?
---
Do random boy vendors sell the serums? I didn’t know mutations could be crafted. That’s awesome!
---
Dupers not only duped TSE weapons, but they also duped junk, they duped nuca colas so they have caps for million years. so any chance of inserting any new valuable items to the market is screw again (supposing we have something like a "global market system" or something similar)
---
a guy just told me he has 1.4m lbs in his character, he traded me and I saw a stupid amount of materials, after that he claimed he had 4 more characters in the same conditions.
---
As you say this is my opinion too, a wipe will just put the things in a neutral state for all of us, inserting new items will just be easier to take to the people with more resources, in this case, duppers.
---
PD: I am not an English speaker, I've may commit some grammar mistakes or similar, so please don't be mad, read with open mind. And as you say this is just my opinion and respect and understand yours too.
---
Well hello Ox
---
Well there are no legendary hunting rifles so you can’t get those by carrying one...lol
---
Ha, this reminds me of a guy in Everquest.  He stood on a counter and then traded all his platinum for copper coins at one of the vendors.
---
Then stepped off the counter and immediately died.  Splat.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if several people had their damage negated due to that glitch. Took her down with something like 10-15 people well before TSE became so prevalent. No one in that group had any explosive weapons at all. 
---
Also the queen specifically has extremely high explosive resistance. Evidently Bethesda knew explosive weapons could be insane and didn't want them trivializing her. 
---
Cool my GT is the same as username wont be on until 6:30 AM CST
---
You on PC? What are you willing to pay for mine? Make me a reasonable offer and it’s yours.
---
I just always play with the pacifist mode on to avoid this. If I’m not actively hunting someone down I don’t want to be able to damage players, and I don’t want them to be able to damage me
---
Bethesda didn't screw me over even once. The told that F76 will be buggy because no one done that before and they will keep improving with players. They are keeping promise very well with daily and weekly updates. Wish other companies care so much for their games not only making cash grab like Obsidian with NV for example. Did you played it? It was more bugged at launch than F76. They just leave it to modder to their work.
---
Thanks guys/gals
---
A lot of mob based events will have one, the golf club has 2-3, but they just appear everywhere if you look hard enough. Occasionally I will clear Harpers Ferry while server hopping for plans at the vendor and I can usually find at least one in the area. It's not as random as it appears. I bet a map of high probability legendary spawns could be made. 
---
God, I hope not. No offense but FO76 takes place looooong before the atom cats existed. 
---
robots are weak to energy, but the higher base damage would be better
---
You can also craft higher level versions of weapons in the weapon workstation, if you have the blueprint unlocked of course and a high enough weapon skill
---
Yeah, occasionally the enclave vendor has plans, and plans drop from Queens. If you look on 1 of the many marketplace subreddits, you'll see people selling for 500 or cheaper
---
Yes, I actually claimed a workshop 2 days ago and was able to hold it without DCing for about 3 hours!  Never lasted  that long before... Usually around 20 mins before get DC'd.   I always assume its Dupping.
---
It's worse than that. Now all anyone needs is your password.
---
Yep, however I do believe the extra pellet explosion deals more dmg than the other explosions as well, but that would only be if explosive scaled off bullet dmg and I’m not exactly sure how it’s determined how much explosive dmg a weapon will do 
---
Stealing doesn't flag you.  Lockpicking (and presumably Hacking) in a claimed Workshop or player CAMP does.
---
Thank all the dupers of two shot explosives that sell them for real world money outside the game at $10 to $20 a pop. They don't care about causing server instability or actually playing the game.
---
also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium[^*](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmsbmeta/)
---
To add on to the pistol problems:
---
Excluding pipe weapons, there's 4 non-auto pistols in the game. 10mm, .44 revolver, Western revolver, single action revolver.
---
The Western revolver is nearly identical too the regular, even in looks, except it has a few less mods and slightly better stats. The single action revolver is worse in every way: less damage, no mods at all, and the reload takes forever. And the 10mm barely does damage. So the only pistol worth having is the Western, there's just no point otherwise.
---
Auto-pistols are even worse: literally just 10mm auto and auto pipe. That's two options. Why is there an entire set of perks devoted to two guns, both of which are not good at all?
---
I’ve got 4 caps bobbleheads for sale if you’re interested in them to boost your farming? 
---
So even though robots are weak to energy you’d still rather hit a robot with a 80 damage melee weapon than a 50/30 damage/energy melee?
---
Just to point out. I somehow have a fast travel mat. Not sure when I got it or how. But I managed to get one a couple weeks back and put it up at my camp. It's currently working at my camp at twin lakes, but it's kind of finicky and will occasionally drop me through the foundation. 
---
I feel like the way they set up the Scorch Beast Queen is to make TSE not as effective for some weird damage reduction which makes the other legendaries more viable IMO. Now are TSE shotguns not completely broken in PVP yes they are.  
---
Just blend a ear of corn, a gross apple thing, some flowers and half of a fucking human sized crab together and you've got yourself quite the refreshing beverage!
---
Gimme ur dupes.
---
But it's a good thing I had about 8000 fusion cells in my stash
---
When you okay, what do you do? I'm 77 and have no clue how what to do next.
---
Can we have some more build budget, too? Please?! 
---
I’m pretty sure I unlocked it through scrapping. It takes a LOT of scrapping to unlock armor mods though. Armor drops are much rarer than weapons to begin with, and almost all armor mods are “very rare” unlock chance via scrapping
---
"So immersive" 
---
Yeah i guess THAT does go against lore, I liked the idea and wanna play with it since we do get these neat although expensive skins. All the mods for the PA i wanna get a kinda Grease monkey/ servos monkey kinda faction going.
---
I would love a way to write notes to leave in the bags with things I drop for them, even if they were temporary items that disappeared after being read. 
---
I rarely wear my headset but also it’d be nice to just leave a bag of stuff somewhere with a little “Pay it forward” note so they know it’s from a player and not just part of the game.
---
I just want a mat because fast travel always spawns me inside a rock...
---
You encounter more fleshy enemies in the overworld than metal ones, but yes the highest damage weapon of that weapon class is usually the best bet 
---
I never bother with energy weapons since they tend to be lackluster in this game
---
I think there story line being cut short in Fallout 4 is a big disappointment 
---
My camp also got destroyed twice  - I no longer build a camp with walls and doors 
---
I just place a bench, stash, a cooking station and two beds right on the road. Many have come and used it to unload their junk, sleep a bit and move on sending me heart signs 
---
Sooo i guess I am a kind of a public truck stop now
---
Is there any chance that you'll change your mind after accidentally getting one of those tse wpns of your likings?
---
I'll take up the offer.  I've been trying to farm whitesprings myself, throwing a nade in the clubhouse then running to the ledge and shooting from there. SubsidingCross2 on xb
---
It is. 
---
What I mean is that it would be neat on a more PVP centric if it were single instance- one person gets it. That's it. 
---
Could be one of many things to play with in the day of private servers, too. 
---
And the mouth harp. They even have some in game, but none can be built in camp. 
---
Super duper in the luck tree is a blessing for everything crafting wise
---
Its existence at all is what it does? Isn't that enough? Lol
---
Yeah seems like a blind leap assuming the mod is at all related
---
Na, not weight limit, just limit the number of items. 
---
Like 5 slots and items cannot be removed once placed there, only destroyed.   That would prevent abuse by players using that for just extra storage.
---
Well the caps don’t really matter in the long run. Cap limit is 25,000 caps. So with new plans and items you purchase in games will drain the caps. Nuka Cola will be used up over time. Also same as Junk. In time that will be corrected.
---
The community is thinking short term. When Bethesda has a long term plan in place. It will not be a issue in the next year.
---
But I have already suggested in the short term. Raise the cost of repair and crafting Materials. There is a perk card that reduces the cost. Which would help them balance it out. One way to do it the higher the level item higher the cost of repair and crafting. After they have permanently patched duping. So the excess junk will be used and sold faster draining the excess the dupers have.
---
Bethesda can’t afford wiping because of the negative feedback and blow back media it will cause.
---
Though Bethesda is going to start adding tools in update where they are going to track characters with super high Inventory numbers. Which believe will lead to them wiping those characters from the game. Yet that going to take a month or 2 for the coding and tools to be added to the game.
---
They are party only if I am not mistaken.
---
I finally got a gun with the explosive mod on it today. It’s explosive, and furious.  And it’s a Salvaged Assualtron Head.  It’s such a bad drop that it’s good and I am keeping it forever. 
---
Agreed. We need more crafting. And the ability to farm more plants, too. 
---
Pretty sure explosive vents is the PA leg perk that makes the super landing in PA do explosive damage, seem to remember doing that in fallout 4 and getting into a bar brawl on accident...
---
Buh bye
---
Just switch servers and rebuild. Rebuilding the camp is cheap. This is rare to meet people like this so don't worry, most people are great:)
---
Lol 😂🤣
---
My fast travel spawns me at the bottom of the mountain, my home is on a cliff edge
---
I have 9 mutations using the toxic water &amp; decontamination shower at Blackwater Mine next to Whitesprings.  
---
Take off Starched genes
---
Take rads to at least 75% health damage
---
Equip SG again
---
Decontaminate
---
Server hop
---
Repeat
---
It’s definitely a mutation lottery.  Took me a good 6 hours of server hopping over two days to get the combination I wanted (Marsupial, Bird Bones, Speed Demon, Carnivore) without any of the unwanted ones.  
---
They already have magazine shelves and the rotating magazine rack available as plans, although they do nothing. If they go the route of making a bobblehead stand, they would need to address the racks as well. Unless you're saying the stands they give will already have bobbleheads/magazines modeled in and you cannot place them in yourself with what you find in the wasteland.   
---
It really dies not need to be a two shot shorty. Get the shotgun and explosive perks and any explosive shorty and your set. 
---
To compete, having a similar setup is not the best solution. Instead, grab some mollies and light 'em up. Thus way you tag all mobs, giving you xp and loot, no matter who gets the kill. Just watch out for friendly npcs.
---
Players with explosive weapons wouldn't be a pest, if they had the courtesy to let others tag mobs before nuking them.
---
That's all there's to it. I'm off to farm Whitesprings, as I lost my exp. shorty to this buggy and laggy joy if a game. Have been trying for over thirty hours in a row, so yeah...
---
...once you get one, you're tempted to let all hell break loose. 
---
Be considerate guys and let the small guys tag the legendaries. 😉
---
I’m at 41 now but several of those levels are from twice tagging along to Whitesprings nuke zones, most of my time has been spent questing, farming materials and building and I’m really enjoying that.
---
Everyone get decontamination shower as first time finishing this event. Explosive vents and overal ultracite parts are umh, learn and dont care bcouse if i kill 9queens in 3hours, i can have tones of those plans in week.
---
What is worth are **serum recipes** and thinks like ultracite jepack which is super rare to drop.
---
Ur super sledge may be good, those legendary she drops are same random as all other legendary enemies drops.
---
Cool I guess I need to mention that in my future build posts as the lone survivor perk is not enough to hint it's a solo build. I could always get the cards from packs and swap them in and out later if I join a team for a quest or boss battle
---
The magazine rack doesn't have magazines on it though, the one in the shop crawl does, and to cut down on lag/issues on load in they will probably be just skins, not actual useable items.
---
When I do attempt to get full Ultracite PowerArmor, this is a perk I shoule Add?
---
I would rather it stay like it is.  Sure, it does not add to the "immersion", but I know exactly who "playerX" is regardless of him logging off and swapping characters after he griefed me for an hour.
---
This yes my favorite thing about my legally farmed tse, got mine from Uranium Fever
---
Omg! Must walk to the flare! 
---
If there is writen party, its party, otherwise they work anyway. For example perk which increase damage on enemies you hit by 15% work for you too and it dont stack, it multiply, so it is OP.
---
And radios? :o
---
It’s not that, it’s because they don’t let Super Mutants join the club #greenlivesmatter
---
Do it a few times over. 
---
If you get one you have to server hop to keep farming them.
---
Toilet paper +500 rad resistance 
---
PS4?
---
Thanks, I understand now
---
Nuka Grape at Whitesprings without Cola Nut card it's -400 rads, with Cola Nut 1 -800 and Cola Nut 2 -1200.
---
Classic
---
Just today I've had 3 different higher level dudes drop me building plans, crafting plans, meds and gear.
---
If only I could say thank you better than a thumbs up. Maybe in text form? 
---
Well... Actually I totally don’t mind that because the helmet (for me) ruins the rest of the suit
---
I think some of the other mods are better like calibrated shocks for the carry weight increase
---
Fallout 4 had this, all I want.
---
There is also weapon stands/power armor stands and mannequins, but not shown as ATX items, however they have been placed into their test workspace cell which contains all buildable (including ATX) workbench items, so theoretically they are potentially coming (or have been scrapped, however they do not have CUT in their names) as plans in game
---
I always assumed there was some notable reason they removed it.   Its still in the game for workshops.
---
I had same issue with falling off cliffside until I just got tired of it and relocated CAMP.   Now I just spawn down the hillside from my camp.
---
Are you on Xbox? I might have one.
---
I'm on PC if you want some help killing scorchbeasts. That quest was a bitch solo.
---
There are fast travel mats in FO76.  Just build a workshop and its in the MISC tab.
---
My bloodied explosive is leagues better
---
I had to move mine tonight because it got attacked on two different servers, just a pain in the ass 
---
If you're asking where it is and haven't found the answer... iirc it's on the mirror in the bathroom in our rooms when we first wake up after the party the night before in Vault 76 at the start of the game.
---
That’s a weird flex, mate.  But that’s cool.
---
I'm so jealous lol. 
---
I understand. I was just laughing at the ridiculous "premium" prices of items in the Atomic Shop. I bought the duster and cowboy hat I spoke of. Sometimes it's awesome to take off the hat. Especially for Photomode. I actually completely agree with you. It's absurd that it wasn't implemented like that. It makes no sense that you can't remove the helmet as an option
---
If you complete the main quest to a certain point you get to fight one 1v1 in a cave where it can't fly away. Then after that they seem to appear every 5 minutes when you're walking around solo. I can't get rid of them, swatting them like flies at the mo
---
I thought so like suppression and it's opposite
---
Hmm this does not happen with the workshops and they have fast travel mats?
---
I expect mannequins eventually (though you may not be able to put armor on them). Haven't seen power armour stands. 
---
But I don't expect them to have everything put in rn either. Otherwise people would plan and save earned atoms vs spending them impulsively and then buying premium, which is how they make their money. 
---
No, been playing since the first one.  
---
I switched to full screen and as of latest patch seems better. Thx
---
Yes. You must enable one drive in the settings, and go to the one drive website on your PC. I am not talking about a singular drive, but the actual program called "One drive."
---
How long will you be on?
---
Easiest way is to also take a screenshot (you can toggle ui), then you can save it to one drive. Or you could save to your phone from the xbox app
---
Screenshot them, then take them from the Xbox App on your computer
---
I can be on whenever. I can be on now if you can
---
rise the materials cost for repairing will just screw new people and not duppers, duppers have MILLIONS of junk dude, just millions, I am serious. that change Will just affect more common people than duppers,
---
cap limit is 25.000, each time you use a nuca cola you get 1 cap, what if duppers have more than 10kkk nucas in each character¿?
---
we are millions playing this as the numbers say (1.4mill) Do you think Bethesda is going to put an employee to look at each inventory? no way dude, and as far as we can see how they have no tools to track anything. Sorry to say it but for me, the most logical decision is to make a massive wipe, but they won't do it either, so we just need to give time to see an answer, nothing else.
---
I don't think so, the only mod slot for it is the muzzle
---
It just seemed like it wasn't a thing without the proper card and I didn't see the point in using it in real-time.  So not only did I not know I could use it, I thought it would suck anyway.
---
Glitching doesn't help either.
---
What do you think is a fair price? Message me gt themisterphenix I will be on in about 20 mins
---
15?!  It feels like 5.
---
Thanks.
---
Thank you.
---
Oh why don't you cry about getting tickled by a random guy on the internet in vain?
---
Not sure about that, they missed a perfect opportunity for a Christmas station.
---
What’s the gun? Lever? Bolt?
---
As increase of Use if junk..the dupers will have to sell it..which average Joe can get cheap.
---
I'll throw some crackers in
---
Appreciate you taking the time for sharing :)
---
Lever max level 2 Shot Explosive But I got to check and make sure I still have it. Eatting right now.
---
Yes. I do not have that.
---
How much will you sell?
---
Lol. You must be one of those people who shoot low levels for no reason. 
---
As long as its local to your client only...
---
I bet your handmades duped too
---
So its like a real radio station then?
---
yeah i wanna say thanks to the guy on Xbox one who dropped me a few weapons and some ammo a few nights ago 
---
Right, I once server hopped for an hour trying to find the lever action rifle blueprint before I gave up. I would’ve gladly paid all 2000 of my caps to just have it and be done with it
---
Not for no reason. Its to slowly gain progress for my 'kill 50 players' achievement.
---
Why don't you just whine about everything?
---
I just messaged you on Xbox. Ill check for fair price. Any items you need?
---
Exactly, imo this is how you enjoy this game ! Did we rush Fallout 3/4 ? No, why do this with this one ?
---
I've noticed that sometimes regular enemies drop legendary loot. The game's pretty fucked in that section
---
bro, I got two and I use them, in every single time, because I mean I'm against duppers but I'm not stupid, they are the best weapons in game, one of those weapons I looted and the other I bought it for 15k caps, before the duping thing was a thing like now (it exist before, just less) and now same weapon cost 1.5k, yes, shit happens.
---
And you know what I do with my TSE weapons? I just change my build, remove the perks and I make less than 200 damage per shot so I cant one-shot nothing, I am the one tagging mobs and the others kill them, that was my fix for this problem.  
---
It is enjoyable but honestly, I would wait till roughly around march before buying this game. Either new content will be out by then or it will be coming out around then. It will help a lot coming into this game when there's more endgame/player interaction/quests to do. Not saying there isn't a lot to do already but I think it would just be best to get it around that time frame
---
I don’t think so..
---
I use in game feature. Not duplicating, not modding, not of illegal. Think this is a lesser funny glich, that not damage other player like duplicating, god mode or other. 
---
Can you help me or not?
---
mine too! \*digital high five\*  
---
Mole miners are the best :)
---
99% lied.
---
I have speed demon. Only perk i have from those you are thinking of is rank3 white knight and rank1 of both luck perks which repair weps/armor when hiting/being hited.
---
And i am okey.  So yeah they are perks. It is survival, not Call of duty boi.
---
Okay. Let me know when your on. 
---
I \*assume\* they lied like 99% of all the youtubers who cover the game.
---
I will invite u to party when I get on
---
I can kinda understand why tho. When your doing all the work clearing and  then find a level 50 has killed the widego downstairs or shot the one legendary ghoul thru the windows, while you were killing everything else for crap loot.  Yeah fuck that guy 
---
RNG
---
Damage&lt;level
---
there was a radio in the beta but its not there anymore
---
I've had a ton of random crashes in the past few days when I've had maybe 2 or 3 for the entire month after launch. I crashed twice just building my camp today
---
At least you have an argument, I give you credit that dude, I don't share the opinión but at least you have one, not like those dumbass screwing this game for all of us on YouTube (just an example)
---
I spam flares into the air if I find the charleston vendor or grahm and see anybody nearby on the map
---
10/10 would sympathise again but the problem is its your own fault for buying or pre ordering it without doing your research. Dont be a drone consumer, take control of your life and responsibilities. You have inadvertantly funded the next minimum effort product and as a result your right to bitch and moan is revoked hahahaha.
---
Idk can you nuke vault 76? Lol
---
For a beta, it's okay.... LOL Anything other than that and it's a waste of time and money. 
---
Good comrade
---
It’s all good, people we never have the same opinion on things. I respect your opinion,but I think my ideas is a safer right for Bethesda in the current anti Bethesda climate.
---
:)
---
Like a preset system? That wouldnt be a bafmd idea at all.
---
You have no idea what this thread is about. Whitesprings has nothing to do with the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
In the institute. 
---
The food and the ammo making perks for example should be straight up permanent buffs whether ‘activated’ or not. So tedious having to manually switch them in and out all the time.
---
When bugs become a meme
---
Fallout stopped being an RPG franchise when bethesda took over it.
---
I was taking single swipes at whatever I could hit, my weapons can’t do shit. This guy would come in and one hit kill anything before I could even try. I get he wanted to protect his loot, so I left it! I just wanted the exp. Really it was the first seriously dick behavior I’ve encountered. Just gotta realize not everyone is nice. 
---
There's a good chance if you place a holotape down somewhere, it's probably not going to be found, unless you place it in an area that many people go to.
---
That first picture was very "it puts the lotion on the skin" lol
---
*returns five* somehow I'm not ashamed to admit as a make in his 40s that I go into parking lots and call out BOOM!! as I make the cars go splodey *cackles*
---
No it doesn't. 
---
Did 3 in a row on the same server the other night. By the end 15+ people were there and she died in under 20 seconds from the event start because she landed instantanly. Only 5 players above 50, 3 in the 100-200 range. 
---
thats...super weird. 
---
the build i want utilities a .50 Cal Machine Gun as the main damage, an explosive weapon (in this case the Bunker Buster) to do massive AoE mob damage and a Flamer as support with the Flame Medic Perk (forgot the actual name)
---
It would be great if any players within that proximity received a brief UI notification as well
---
This is good to know, as I still have to finish that quest. Ended up getting bombarded with 3 or 4 scorchbeasts on my way there, and I didn't have the right stuff to kill the legendary scorchbeast at the end. Ended up running out, only to have the damn scorchbeasts waiting on the other side of the door, who then followed me to the southern-most point of the map, then westward towards Watoga. 
---
How the hell do you even take those guys down?! I suspect that either I missed some clue at some point, but every time I encounter one, I tend to die. I've managed to kill one, but I think that was a fluke. I also only solo the content, which is probably problem #1.
---
If your trying to do your part then I agree it was a dick move.  Thought it was a more he just attacked and was trying to explain why maybe. But if your amongst it then yeah dick move 
---
I had the same thing. I did see like 3 or 4 of them in the end during the slog.
---
Yes i was aslo thinking about that.
---
Nice, very Raider-y.
---
What is a tse
---
For sure 🤣
---
I get it sometimes where the [load holotape] prompt is greyed out. I usually toggle around the terminal, clicking things and clicking out of them, and tgen I am able to load a holotape after messing with the terminal for a while. Thats the workaround that I found. Hipefully it works for you too.
---
I spend the first half hour of every session finding the newest player I can. I craft them some starter weapons and armor, give lots of ammo, and enough meds to get the through a couple days. If they have enough stuff, I'll spruce up their camp with a purifier and a small garden.
---
The more pleasant this game is for new players, the longer they'll stick around.
---
Do nukes with a group and have someone share radsponge. I don't know when i last used radaway besides selling it. 
---
I never owned a duped weapon.  I never bought anything ever from a player.  I never accepted any dropped items from a player.
---
Yet, I am all for a complete item wipe, stored and on all characters on the account.
---
This is just the One X version on a 4K monitor.
---
I have the PC version too, yes I bought it twice add me (ZeroFoxFK) but I've found the image not as sharp... but that's because my PC can't handle 4K 😅
---
But wow the framerate! 
---
I discuss it here + I often post pics.
---
https://twitter.com/ZeroFoxFK/status/1080992996303224834?s=19
---
But at the same time, if you only drop holotapes at one spot, it would be less immersive, because there would only really be holotapes about that specific location.
---
And if someone made their holotape not related to the place it was located at, it wouldn't make sense, because how did the holotape get there in the first place?
---
I actually would LOVE that.  I am level 96 and don't have these TSE at all.  Never saw one drop.  Heck never saw a TS drop.  Or any of the weight reduction armors, ect.  I just play with whatever comes... Or I make it.  I often have better luck making my own. 
---
So It would be awesome if they just credited everyone with 1000 caps and removed all items (stored and on person)... Not junk mind you.
---
Ok thanks homie! I’ll keep my eyes open. My first char was level 65 but I started over lol I’m level 30.
---
What ?
---
I know this feel all too well. Lost many mutations to it. On the bright side, I now have all the mutations I want! (Marsupial, speed demon, healing factor, herbivore, adrenal rush) Just keep at it, and may lady luck find you.
---
If you nuke the nuka Cola factor, you get nuka quantum.
---
If you nuke Bethesda, you get skyrim but all npc wear radsuit. 
---
If you nuke a nuke silo, you gonna have a bad time. 
---
Makes you wonder whether there are level designers who put it on right and level designers who put it on wrong or it's just one guy purposefully mixing it up. I prefer the former with the clashing toilet direction ideologies.
---
They weren’t wrong. A bunch of shills. By god, this sub reads like r/TheDonald when you bring up Russia.
---
\*Bethesda:
---
	 Add into the game new state: "Herniated Lumbar Disc"
---
		Description: Characters who have more than 1.5k lbs in their storage will now suffer herniated lumbar disc, it will cause your character to suffer 1%/max hp damage per second and will root it to the floor, while this sickness is currently on active state the character will also receive the new state called "loss of appetite"
---
Add into the game new state: "Loss of appetite"
---
		Description: While this state is currently active the character affected will now suffer 1%/max hp per second and won't be able to eat food or drink any liquid.
---
 I have all armor pieces with ap regen, 23agi build, and using 4\* machete to stab everything. If i get spoted, i stand up and crouch again. Doing Scorchbeast queen runs. In silo there is one part where you **must** have atleast hazmat if no PA. Queen depends on where you send nuke. If you make zone with edge on prime fisure site, you can do it without any rads, if some noob send it with prime fisure in center of zone, you need hazmat. There is no way to survive 7rads per second which is minimal without PA/hazmat. 
---
Interesting.
---
Your idea is very good in theory. In practice a lot of people will get banned for the messages they leave behind. The problem with this game was always the people. Not using voice chat the game intended, duping, killstealing mobs with TSE shotguns, the community is very anti-social.
---
no it does not that is what makes it work so well
---
You paid for virtual currency in the worst game of the year, that has no market
---
Haha yeah. I like to imagine what it's like in that office. 
---
I always kind of thought that having it backwards was somehow easier to model, since the flap of paper would be against the wall. I'm not really sure though, my 3D modeling career was very short lived and involved very poor education 😅
---
ive been testing it as well, its placebo.  ive been killing 3 stars letting their hp regen to full and ill still get no legendaries sometimes even after waiting over their corpse. its just totally random.
---
Is this a real thing that’s a good first step
---
They should add if you die to this you lose everything in your Inventory not equipped.
---
my three "green thumbs" cards beg to differ
---
There are perks such as nerd rage that give you huge buffs if your health is below 10% or something. There’s others too but I’m not really into those niche tank builds. Basically, those guys have insane legendary weapons and run around with their health bar soaked in rads to lower their health for maximum effect 
---
If there are going to be dogs, I also politely request cats. 💓 🐈
---
Sadly it is just my imagination, haha, but I'd love to see this.
---
I'm not a shill its my experience. I played fallout 4 survival for 100+ hours "cleared" every cell in the game and entered far harbor level 127 ish no mods just survival.  I enjoyed it alot and like the the aspects they improved upon, Should bethesda have released a game uncomplete is up for debate. Personally though i feel like the people who are upset people like the games are the same people who can't make friends to play it so they play their RPS so they can carry out there god complex with "companions" 
---
I am allways in a hazmat suit under my power armor for this reason:) And to repair in the middle of nuke zones..
---
It's a survival game.
---
So yes, they're perks.
---
If you dont like the survival aspect, maybe the games not for you
---
and we can share [The Duster](https://youtu.be/Ri_Kn90fbVo)
---
Not really, no. 
---
WE DON'T CARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
(lvl 45 with lvl 5 gunsmith here) I had a level 16 build a CAMP on the opposite side of Charleston station  (under the electricity tower) a week or so ago, I decided to make him a level 15 silenced and super buffed 10mm pistol, I ran over to his base and he had logged off :(
---
I'm fairly sure the toilet paper roll is just a cylinder with a texture on it. No need to waste time modeling that.
---
You get a nuclear turducken.
---
What a legend man! True champion of the community!
---
Hmm maybe if we can only place one holotape per location Per server?
---
It can limit the holoflood and we can use the Camp system to place the holotape correctly on a desk or something.
---
About the holotape... Hum... I don't know... Maybe if we can add a random drop in container allowing us to found "blank holotape" 
---
So we can use them to record our adventures? 
---
If bethesda want us to rebuild America so let's be the actors
---
If your ever in Watoga station, check the blue suit case, at other stations check the registers, people leave goodies in there all the time.
---
Or you can wait til everyone else tags them.
---
Sorry mate that was me not that...thing.
---
I feel like maybe the eggs and the “stalking” mothman are connected. Maybe when you cooked em, or used them in a workbench or whatever, it spawned one.
---
haha, I am going to sleep with a smile in my face, thanks for that.
---
Huge hype up to launch is pretty much every game's marketing plan, and relying on modders isn't really a bad thing, there are almost no game developers make game that can be mod like Bethesda's, the reason why it's having so many problem and people mostly overlook them is simply because only Bethesda made this kind of game that is also super flexible modding platform, and as I already mention in my post most of their engine problem has been improved overtime, Fallout 4 was the most stable one yet (didn't count 76, it was clearly rush it out of window while it needed more time).
---
And as many has already said it before, engine are made out of code like every other computer software and each version is build and improve upon the previous one such as Windows, Adobe Photoshop, Unreal Engine,Microsoft Office, Visual Studio and even IOS, it's how computer technology works, I don't know why it's so hard for people to understand it, not to mention it's the only engine capable to do what Bethesda and the modding community did with it, it sure has many problem, but those problem aren't unsolvable, Bethesda probably just don't have enough of time or staff to work on it, I'm not saying they don't need to fix it, they should, but replace it isn't guarantee to solve it's problem.
---
What’s the deal with wooden armour anyway? You don’t find it until you’re most of the way into the main quest where combat armour becomes a staple. Seems totally redundant 
---
Check out your error code I’m having the same problem all I have to do is back up my save data then initialize your PlayStation 
---
Good to know. Presumably this would work for any mod, like for hydraulics mods on both arms or multiple jet packs on the multiples of the same model chest? 
---
One little tip for survival mode is that you can fill up empty beer bottles at a sink and it gives you purified water. Can’t do that in 76 but it’s super useful in 4’s survival mode. 
---
Just make sure you have the right week's code. I solo'd the thing and entered the previous week's by mistake. RIP keycard.
---
I have my base set up relatively near the starting area, around Flatwoods. So because of this a lot of new players stumble across my base. I’ve been helping a lot of lower level players out. 
---
I had a level 15 two shot crossbow I just kept in my stash. It was cool but I’m a unarmed character so I have no use for it. I figured I might as well make some new players day. So I found a level 15 wandering around, dropped the bow and a bunch of ammo for it in front of him. He loved it and ended up inviting me to his team. I played with him for a while helping him and his friend out in more difficult areas before having to leave. He messaged me afterwards thanking me and friended me. 
---
I’ve honestly gained so many friends on Xbox since getting this game. Just teaming up with so many friendly randoms, some of which I even play with regularly. 
---
Yeah but the little flap of paper for a roll where the paper isn't against the wall makes it just a touch more complicated. Yeah it's just a plane but 😅 that's one of the only reasons I can think of to be...*ahem*...wrong about toilet paper.
---
who is this "we all" you are talking about?
---
I tried to drop some loot for a lever 5,6 and 7 and did... a bunch of plans and meds etc. then they attacked me, I guess they thought they could kill me so I emptied a double barrel into each of their heads. I dropped more stuff for them and turned on the mic “I’m trying to help you morons, it’s in the paper bag”. Gave em the heart sign, let off my double barrel into the sky and ran away lol
---
I don’t care if you like the game. That is not, or was not, up for debate. Neither however, is the status of fo76. Perhaps
---
you’ve grown accustomed to the buggy nature of Bethesda games you’ve forgotten what a release typically is: a finished product. The BETA lasted literally two weeks. Also, the no-friends argument is moot. If you had anything besides simply insulting those who disagree with you, I’d be reading it. Criticism of a product should not prevent or interfere with your own opinions on a product unless you wish them to. I have no quarrel with those opinions; my interest (or rather annoyance) is only piqued when you attempt to justify the state of development of the game and the manner in which it was launched. 
---
Last week I got am invite,  thought it was the lvl 120 defending a workshop with me.  They kept spamming the come here emote,  eventually I fast travel to them,  turns out it was a lvl 25 at the haunted house is the mire.  They still had quest to go to the overseers camp.  I took over the nearby red rocket workshop and they joined,  the defend quiet was against a scorchbeast which at level 38 I didn't want to do but couldn't tell the other guy to run.   
---
They did the come here emote again so I looked and they had gone instead a toilet cubicle and shut the door! 
---
Please let me record drunk fallout history holotapes
---
I dont usually play pvp  unless they shoot first. And they are powerful. And I think she adjust to our level because we are all lv110+
---
it creates a portal to MP skyrim, at least thats thats what i heard anyway, it does cost at the portal though, thanks todd xxxox
---
ShinyPaws, a TSE is a Two-Shot Explosive weapon, it is two stars or superior weapon that shoots one extra shoot  (consuming just one) and the ammunition explodes making AoE damage. These weapons are the is the most OP weapons in the game right now.
---
AoE means Area of Effect.
---
OP means Over Powered.
---
That's how I felt when I hit level 50. Even with its flaws Fallout 4 is such a better game than 76, it's crazy.
---
I wondered about that one too. Saw it while traveling the same mountains mentioned earlier. I didn't even get to shoot, it just disappeared. I remember a streamer once finding one and saying he needed to kill it for a challenge. Hope to see it again.
---
Ty for the suggestions :)
---
Yes... That's a shame and very sad for people who want to make friends...
---
But I have still fate in the community. I think... We can leave a message to players need interaction each other due to the lack of NPCs.
---
In a way we are the "npc" we just need to be more alive and not like we commonly see in this game [mute power armored guy with TSE shotgun doing a thumb up and leave without any interaction] 
---
That's the time I  go to bed cst
---
Sometimes I’ll just listen to roses raider radio because I want to hear a talking (robot) person.. I really wish we could have activated a robot or had like a super mutant to be the host of the main radio.
---
I picked a site that is diagonally opposite to vault 76, high in the mountains. Saves a lot on travel costs. I also spend a lot of time in Watoga and like nice views of nukes dropping.
---
I am sure you can find someone selling one, especially a lower level one, or just finding one sold to a vendor if you are patient:)   
---
Check the FO76 market on reddit:)
---
You coming onto this thread calling us shills for liking a game is a dick move anyway you put it so me calling you out for possibly not liking the games because you haven't experienced it with friends is valid. I just don't see the point in you coming calling people shills being a dick and then getting defensive when someone calls you out
---
I nuked Harpers Ferry and did not get a lot of items, sure.
---
But I got a different experience.   Did not get CAMPS sitting outside the golf door.   Did not have jerks TSE shotgunning everything dead in seconds.
---
Just got some level 40+ trying to get some loot.   I would MUCH rather nuke anything other than those two places.     
---
I got 4 keycards and I guarantee not a single nuke will be from me to Whitespring or Prime.     I will nuke something new every time and try it out.  
---
Hah I am pretty sure that would be fun and make people chuckle
---
Get the perk "Sun Kissed". It is in the Endurance list. OR.  Run to WhiteSprings.  On the third floor past the bar, on the left side is a nuka-cola bot called "bubbles".  She has something called "Nuka-Grape".  It heals up to 400 rads.  Does not take away mutations.  
---

---
the way i figured i was going to buy junk food that week , i just got the caps instead with it , probably the healthier choice 
---
I used to be on GiantBomb's forum, I did get some decent conversation there from people who do read my post but moderators there really don't like controversial topic, and it's forum's format could make some of the reply pretty hard to read so I have to repeat the things I said for people who missed it, which is why I come to reddit but looks like it might not the best idea, I thought about make a video about it but I'm not a very good English speaker, thanks for the suggestion though.
---
word well hit me up we can get a thing going sometime 
---
Yes maybe it will work if the holotapes would have a vote score system like the messages you leave in Dark Souls. And the ones who get downvoted will not be visible while the ones with most upvotes will be visible the most.
---
Agreed. I've only had one really negative experience with someone. Farming a well known event for handmade blueprints and while avoiding shooting more then a few times? Get a level 20 saying...genuinely offensive things about someone being past area level.
---
Bleh. Honestly though the lack of high endgame seems to pan out in lots of well off characters with excess more then happy to toss some to help others. Especially with a storage cap for hoarding.  Interesting how that works. I kind of dig that.
---
You can buy another one from a player pretty cheap though!
---
Hm, I guess I'll have to check that out now.
---
Fist fight arena
---
I know its survival, of a human, with human requirements. Do you need to eat and drink that much day to day? If so tou need to see a doctor...
---
Hi, do you remember where did you get the Protective and Shielded Raider under armor linings?
---
I'd rather use your website that can show me things on the fly than /r/fo76bazaar.
---
Did you mean your ice axe job with Trotsky?
---
I AM Vault-Tec!
---
I love reddit
---
Sure! Breaking it up by topic to post on reddit might work as well. Maybe like one topic a day starting with whatever you're most interested in. 
---
Sorry, it looks like you spent a lot of time on it, I would be kinda bummed.
---
My brain was wondering fine before I read this, now I question if life is a simulation.
---
You guys ever find a solution or resolve for this?
---
Always open to that but love the idea of true tests of PA VS Non PA defense against non legendary weapon sneak crit damage
---
Count me in that club too. So I guess it's a baker's dozen then. 
---
Absolutly dont have idea, where to get that. I bought it twice from market reddit page. Becouse i scraped first one when i was in power armor (fuck power armors). I belive if you make post there someone will make it for you, or if someone else will know, where to get it, i would also like to know.
---
I'll test that out with the perk that let's you see their resistance if so then tse are not that broken. Also for white springs my group uses automaic Tesla rifles [the damage arcs between groups of glowing ones and ensures all of them get hit also some of us have special ones. I have a double ammo my friend  has 2 shot and another has a ghoul slayer one we usually tag along with a like 6 people and we just tap the glowing ones a few times and let others get a couple of hits if the struggle theres a tse shotgunner at all times (usually take turns to who's the shot gunner sometimes the heist level is. He just one shots them if low levels are dying or loosing or struggling that way he can still earn some xp.) I hate players that steal kills using  tse and going full aggro and advancing to the spawns to get the kills first. 
---
On PS4 I have approx.. 2 disconnects per 2h, mostly than when I try several things together, being into fight... Then everything lags and I lost the connection to the server... which is annoying when doing quests in final stage ... :-/  
---
Not all that was available day one either.
---
Yes! That's a very good idea!
---
It can filter stupid messages or trolls
---
Damn it I want see happy gamers wishing to make a game more alive instead of being selfish and only play to show others you're godlike.
---
Sometime the spirit is clearly more effectif than brut force and and wnat make sure people find a happy way to share thier adventures with others. 
---
What platform are you using? I've *definitely* taken more than 51 photos. (There are challenges for taking like 20-40 per region and I have almost all of them lol!)
---
Agreed on the stuff, too. I just want more options really.
---
Yeah, I was wondering if he was labeled 'Stalking Mothman' as a certain variant or just because he was stalking me. I know I've heard others mention that there are stages and they begin with him "stalking" the player. As for the eggs, I'll have to see. I visit Point Pleasant often and farm the eggs as a source of caps. I hadn't cooked them yet when he appeared. Maybe he was stalking me because he was worried about me eating his offspring lmao.
---
You get a legendary item as a quest reward too. Its usually two stars. 
---
With melee you have -75% armor perk, so um, who cares about tin can? 
---
yes but you also get a 45% melee damage reducing perk as well
---
Humble brag
---
Why do fireflies have ammo in their pockets and why do they even have pockets?
---
Getting philosophical.... 
---
“Same people who can’t make friends”. That’s you calling me out? You have no reason to assume I can’t make friends. That’s a complete assumption so I fail to see how it’s relevant. Again, I will restate (for the third time). I do not care if you like the game. I am not telling you that you aren’t allowed to like the game. Like the game. I do not care. But please, do not insinuate Bethesda put any time, effort, or passion into this project. FO76 is the closest thing we’ve seen from Bethesda to a yearly release. Consider it an intermediary, then realize the state of development at launch. This game was a half-realized, unfinished product designed to generate as much revenue as possible off the backs of those who support Bethesda regardless. Knowing this, you have the gall to postulate a lack of friends as the reason of discontentment? Every game is fun with friends. 
---
I play on Xbox One. I was playing with a friend earlier and we were trying to get the weekly challenge for taking photos around Vault 76 done and it stopped me after 50 total saying I reached the maximum amount. That’s wild lol! And you still have almost all the photos in your gallery too? Wow omg
---
Ah. Thank you for explaining
---
I usually Farm suits of power armor for caps. When I'm done I usually give the frames and fusion cores away to people coming out of the vault. Along with a level five tactical scoped hunting rifle and 200 rounds. Or level 5 spiked board. 
---
Im level 100 power armor heavy gun build. I can easily kill a whole whitespring nuked zone with enough time if i wanted to by myself. But even someone my level struggles to get tags/kills on the legendary enemies because the TSE meta literally makes it impossible for someone without a TSE or some other one shot weapon to get any kills if ONE TSE asshole is around. It becomes first come first serve.
---
I was running away from enemies  and I got a 20 cap bounty for breaking the wall into someone's house to use their bed. After using the bed I ran to the BlamCo Mac and Cheese Factory (Don't remember what the location is called) I barricaded all the entrances, set up food packaging machine and spent 45 minutes there. Then a guy broke in and claimed the bounty on me. When I went back, he hadn't taken my dropped loot, instead he stayed behind and gave me some Nuka Cola Quantum and a Brotherhood Recon Rifle. We then teamed up, he took me to his C.A.M.P., and guess what? It was the one I broke into earlier.
---
I fucking love this game.
---
You want to do perk war with me?
---
Maybe because of how much Bethesda has dropped the ball recently? Selling beta access as a feature and then not giving enough time in the beta to fix the bugs that were found and submitted by players? Using assets that were in stock fallout 4 and then selling them as new things to the game? All the bugs and glitches that were found in fallout 4 and they didn't even bother to fix then and plan on leaving in game in fallout 76? implementing  the atomic shop and selling things as discounted when they were never on the shop before and even then using lazy stock animations and just inserting the small animations above the players instead of what was advertised?  Banning players that tried to mod the game? And that's not even getting into the lore rewrites The nuka dark rum fiasco? The power armor edition bag fiasco? Problems with keeping players information secure?
---
This is not just me being negative these are all real problems bethesda has had. I love bethesda games I ave so many fallout posters in my room and collector editions That I own multiple copies of fallout. The fallout 4 map is framed on my wall. But these problems were simple stuff to fix. It shows a lack of caring about their fanbase to me anyways. Look all I'm saying is that Bethesda needs to get their shit together or how morty said it; 
---
"Just get your shit together. Get it all together, and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together. And if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere. You know? Take it to the shit store and sell it. Or put it in a shit museum, I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together.
---
Just get your shit together." 
---
if you buy something from a vendor, trade with another character, find a bag with materials on the floor or some weapons, you now can not be sure if you have or not any dupped items. sorry dude it is like this
---
.50 Cal is your main damage machine gun, use a gataling gun (5mm) as a combat shotgun replacement, rocket launcher as an explosive weapon, harpoon gun is your sniper rifle :P
---
If you do want explosive area damage you can use the broadsider but I am not a fan of it.
---
The telsa rifle is listed as a heavy weapon in the official guide but it also doesn't work with the perks so I am not sure if they changed to one too.
---
I hadn't picked up a flamethrower since I started doing heavy weapons to know if it is any good. I read somewhere that the crossbow comes under the heavy weapon perk but I havent confirmed it.
---
Friendly Fire is the name of that perk.
---
Thanks for that, been hunting for it for forever. 
---
I press 3 when hungry and 4 when thirsty.  Very simple.
---
Its not difficult and I have zero perk cards equipped for that.   
---
I spend about 10 minutes getting crops and cooking soups/blackberry juice when first logging on.   Not a big deal.
---
Pretty sure it's only weapons with a receiver/capacitors that can be modded
---
Lol yeah i do love theorycrafting but youll need to give me a couple mins to do some things first lol 
---
Yeah I take like at least 50 a day 😅 Fallout 4 gave me a serious screenshot problem. I like to look back on my favorite quests, scenery, and character progression.
---
It happens at the Landview lighthouse and is super easy to do and I think there is also a quest at hunters shack or somewhere that lets track and kill a vengeful one.
---
Whos the bigger shill? Someone who talks crap about a VIDEO game all the time and complaints about how shit the studio is and all their games. Or a consumer who sees the good in a product they bought with their money? I spent way too much for a pos game but its improving and I'm seeing the good in it. Sure not polished but can we make a subreddit of our in game funny moments or glitches captured? It's not a elder scrolls or a main fallout game is A SPIN OFF fallout shelter was a spin off and look at how popular it and how other developers are stealing their formula. Bethesda is just trying something new. The tried horror and evil within and look at how well it did. It has their own cult following we jut happen to like this weird experiment of a game. 
---
For level 50 (with 40respect points) it is worth to do even Fertile soil event, becouse you can get even from 1lvl event reward at your level (50) legendary armor piece.
---
But yeah if you want tones of legendaries go on golf
---
I normally find 3 star legendaries walking up and down the road in the mire between harpers ferry and Abbies bunker. But honestly though golf course probably has a higher rate. But I feel like I get better quality from things that aren't ghouls. 
---
no problem mate.
---
or complete item wipe...
---
It's possible to get blank holotapes already. Why not just use those?
---
I tried making Nikolai Belinski from Call of Duty Zombies.
---
Yes, so far I've seen one honeybeast, one mothman and one angler, a bunch of crickets twice. I am lv45 and  exploring. Been to Whitesprings a couple of times, but honestly fighting those ghouls solo and not tagging along high-level players. I have never been to the Mire and Cranberry Bog. And I am not in a hurry to do so. The only thing I dislike about the game is tedious inventory management.
---
Yeah, ESO does this.
---
Ya that’s what I assumed. Is there any mods for the dragon? I can’t say I’ve ever seen any
---
No it didn't.
---
yep that too
---
Can't wait for PvP full drop permadeath server.  Might have a slightly different vibe.
---
Nuke cola grape can be purchased on the 2nd floor of the whitesprings resort. It cures 400 rads, 150HP, and 50AP. Use it instead if radaway 
---
I don't like the limit but the truth is without it I would hoard so much stuff I'd never use. 
---
I do the same thing!! I took SO many screenshots playing FO4 and it’s so cool looking back at everything I did and reliving the memories, and it’s something I’ve been doing with 76 too! 
---
Sony requires that players account names be displayed at all times.
---
Lol, it isnt about how easy or difficult it is to  gather, cook and eat. It's how often and how much, its so not normal. Add up how much you eat and drink playing the game, its a bit daft...
---
They ate someone with ammo and why shouldn't they not have pockets? 
---
And now you share with newbies. That is cool. 
---
I was in a double-nuked Whitespring yesterday with my team. We all run vampiric knives, them combat knives and me a Cultists blade. We aim to basically tag everything and let as many others get hits in as we can. We also all run in pacifist mode so we can go stab crazy without accidentally hurting a fellow player. Oh and we Do go crazy with those knives, mine has a 40% faster swing speed, coupled with Martial Artist it is insanely fast, very few enemies can break past the heal from it. 
---
A dude kept running ahead of us and one hitting everything with his overpowered TSE. Now we had worked hard to launch two nukes simultaneously and here was some fool coming in and completely ruining the experience for us.
---
I quickly had enough and went and stood in front of him. I kept blocking him when he tried to go past. He started trying to shoot me. One team-mate has ricochet lvl 3 shared. So basically he was doing no real damage to me, but was hurting himself with his explosive shotty, when he switched to another weapon he again did no damage but a fair few bullets rebounded back on him. 
---
So he starts to get all aggravated and began trying to melee me. I have the Electrically Charged mutation and coupled with Strange in Numbers that makes for a pretty powerful gamma (i think) burst when he was hitting me.
---
He gave up attacking and we stared each-other down for a moment. Then I turned and walked off towards my team-mates. I heard his footsteps as he started to follow, so I turned and gave the hand up, no-entry looking NO sign.
---
I carried on, he didn't follow and we didn't see him again for the rest of our time there.
---
Asshole averted.
---
The clock. Never changes.
---
Usually, when a nuke is launched at Fissure Prime, enough people that are playing on the server will magically appear at the site. That's one thing Bethesda got right.
---
I'm on xbox so I screenshot them. I then look at the screenshots on the Xbox app on my phone and screenshot that to my phone. I can then save the best for loading screens if I want or just delete to make room for more.
---
It would be a nice feature to be able to view them online or something and we can then save them elsewhere if we choose. 
---
I have the same issue. Now i can crash 3-5 times in a row upon the start of each session. I am on PC and have had my share of crashes straight tomdesktop since Beta but this is something new. I never receive an error code for crashes, the game just freezes for a few seconds and the i am straight tomdesktop.
---
I have a new PC (2080, i7 8700, 32 gb ram, m2 Evo SSD) which is not even strained on highest settings. My conclusion for myself since Beta start is that the patches has overall been great but for my PC stability each patch has been positive or negative to frequence of crashes. Last patch(es) has been the best so far for in game fixes/updates but the worst for my stability. Hardly ever have lag but do suffer from the occational ”server not responding” servers that are a total mess. Do not care if it is due to dupers or not it is up to Bethesda to fix now.
---
At lvl 220 atm and still love the game but the recent crash fest at the start of each session is annoying even if it goes quick to log in multiple times until it works.
---
Hope it gets better for you mate and that Bethesda gets to this issue soon. I hope they start with all effort on the dupers though, regardless if they lag servers or not, the are the scum of Appalachia and need to be long gone before player vending is introduced. Wishful thinking i know.
---
/Grillaren
---
great. as far as the thumbs down appear in my replies I can see not a lot of people like to admit they have dupped items.  it is an online game and there is a small chance you don't interact with others and that can make you safe from dupes. but still the point is that almost everybody has or had something duped and it is ok we can not control that anymore at this point.
---
How fast the gatlin guns break does drive me nuts but i am good with the food aspect
---
Is it posible, to have unyielding and -15% damage while standing effect on one piece of armor? Isn't those two same class of effect?
---
I love helping people out, I just rarely see others doing it. I am constantly dropping aid, weapons, ect in mailboxes, by players feet, oversees cache, government supply drops, and other random places. 
---
I have 6 points in Charisma because Lone Wanderer and Field Surgeon. I also swap them with  Happy Camper, Hard Bargain and Travel Agent when doing that stuff. I'm interested in Party Girl for the strength bonus from alcohol, and maybe Suppressor to reduce target's damage output. But I'm not 100% sure if I would want more points in Charisma. Actually reduced it to 4 for simply Lone Wanderer in some recent build plan. Why do people recommend more for you?
---
OK I have to make a confession of my stupidity here...
---
I'm not a new player at all, but am on a 2nd character and was helped out a bit in Flatwoods when this character was a level 3 (now 30). At the time there were two of us and I knew exactly what the high level was doing while the other did not so I got the bag -- I even left stuff in it (he put like 2 of some things) to share but the other guy was a no hoper on that regard... Anyway, flash forward to when I am a level 30 and doing great last night. I spot a couple of 150+s right by the overseer's camp... Oooh, I think, they must be dropping stuff off to help players... Maybe I could... So I fast travel over and go up to the overseer's stash. It's FULL of ammo, which I start picking out, worried they'll see me and get mad. The ammo gives way to legendary weapons and armor... And SO MUCH JUNK... Oh my goodness they must be like quitting and dropping ALL their gear in one last hurrah... I go into the inventory... no "collect all"... Shit. They're defo going to see me doing this and blow me to pieces so I lose all the junk. So I'm just hammering collect over and over working my way down the list... No time to check I'll do that after.... But how will I get away now sitting at 500 carry capacity!? Don't worry about that just grab it... All of it! Yes... Done... Wait... As I get to the bottom I of course realise I've just emptied my stash.... !
---
Started a new FO4-save earlier this week. Haven't played 4 since 76 was launched, and it was so good to be back at the Commonwealth :) Started building Sanctuary with some new building mods, nice!
---
I have two 76 characters, first is at 100+ level and it feels there is nothing left to do. I made a different build for second character, now level 80 and I think I'm finished pretty soon. 
---
Hope there will be new content or such soon.
---
Had a 2 shot auto laser with beam splitter, went from full health to broken in 2 reloads..... no joking, pointless.
---
To my knowledge it is possible. For whatever reason it seems that sentinal can be either a major or minor effect.
---
Duping screws the server.  People DC all the time.  Kills the game experience, people get fed up and dont play.
---
Workshops become pointless because DC'd all the time. Kills the game experience and people dont use them.
---
TSE are flooded and nuke zones are full of people with them, no point in you actually trying to kill anything, better to go AWAY from people to get a chance at killing something if you dont have a TSE.   TSE make the game pretty anti-social because you often try and solo much more.
---
Explosive mods just need to be removed on all weapons in the game completely until they are re-done. (nerfed down to management levels)
---
I love doing stuff like that
---
&gt;And if you like to be a dick just go play rust and be that kind of player where you will feel more than comfortable with that toxic people.
---
'Stop playing Fallout76 the way you want to reeeeeeee'.
---
A penny saved 
---
Soon the atom shop will have a zoo section
---
The hell is this? Xp  glitcher didn’t like boomy boom guns? Why don’t we just wipe the levels while we are at it? The nuclear option is never the right option. Claiming duper’s don’t like your post because you can face the fact that maybe just maybe. Not everyone including people that don’t dupe don’t agree with your opinions. Not to mention that holier than thou attitude. 
---
New players and lower levels is always fun to help out
---
He was talking in general. He didnt mean you. But if the shoe fits. Like I said it's a project they got other studios or departments with more developers. This was just an experiment else scrolls wont be affected th ay why they plan games so far along. Bethestha the publishing company has done a bad job and Bethesda the studio is atleast hearing our complaints. And fixing issues. You rather them drop the game and everyone who bought it and spent time to get f*cked? They planned on it not being great thays why they are sticking with it. The publisher rushed them and so they are atleast  going to give us a year of updates and patches unlike blizzard games that  just continue  to be updated year after year. Again it's just a game the haters can resell their copies or give them out ot throw the game out or delete it if they hate the game that badly. And maybe be careful before you buy a game next time? And just let us try enjoy the game enjoy it? What is arguing or whining going to do? Bethesda knows the game is a mess already 
---
Me too
---
When I see like level 9 or 15 etc. I gesture "come here" and craft them maxed out (at their level) Armor Piercing Silenced Pipe Rifles w/Recon scopes because I remember how much that weapon helped me, and I make them .308 Sniper Rifles because that was my favorite weapon of all, until around level 50+ or so when enemies started becoming too tough for it.
---
Now I use Handmade and Lever Action (both Supressed w/max Rifle/Sneak/Covert/Tank Killer/Bloody Mess &amp; Tenderizer perks and an Agility of 18 / Perception 17 just too achieve sufficient rifle damage - I really do miss those early/mid levels where I could one shot headshot most enemies with "just" a Sniper Rifle!!
---
I also give every low level that I run into (that sticks around long enoughfor me to give stuff) a care package including some Stimpacks.
---
If you have problems with thirst and hunger, you're doing something wrong. No, seriously, it is like the easiest part of the game to manage. 
---
My toon is constantly at &gt;90% wherever I am with zero hunger/thirst perk. 
---
He did. 
---
Glad you're being downvoted by this obviously impartial and unbiased sub
---
thanks good advice!
---
ps4 cant leave power armor
---
I think you meant D:&lt;
---
I have 4 characters. I’ve seen one tse drop and 2 ts drop. The tse is a level 20 pipe rifle, it’s so good it’s viable at level 50 still. One of the 2 shots was level 5 pipe pistol and the other was a Gatling gun that was like level 35. :-/
---
I guess they assume I play in teams of four but most of the friends on PS4 don't like fallout or fallout 76 for that matter. I am playing 76 with my wife so the maximum is 2 all the time but I don't see the point in reducing damage output for some of the charisma perks there. I think most of them are make for some one who wants to play the field medic in there squad. you know the guy who has all the medical supplies and so focuse this to keep people alive.
---
That's a silly argument. If we want to be realistic, every time you die you shouldnt be able to reincarnate. 
---
Game has rules. This is its rule. It's that simple. 
---
Again that power armor and dark rum was the publisher not the studio. Also yeah they did drop the ball on selling the beta pretty much
---
I get that it sucks not being able to tag enemies in an event sometimes but you cant really be mad at someone for having a stringer charavter than you. I personally use a TSE shotgun and the only other weapon I carry is a sledge hammer so if I dont use my shot gun then I wont get to tag half the enemies either. Its just a dog eat dog world, eventually you will have the similar weapons and you'll see what I mean.
---
How's this one?
---
[https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)
---
:,(
---
I’ll concede your point about the publisher-developer divide. I’ve stated my opinions and I’ll let my comments speak for themselves. On the topic of Blizzard, I’d argue that most updates are merely balance related.
---
ive gotten tse shotguns as legitimate drops and i can use them however i want. try and stop me
---
Will add you now
---
You hero! That’s perfect 
---
I thought she was saying fuck it... awww fuck it. Fuck fuck fuck it!
---
I'm running at 1080p 60Hz, as that is the native setting on my TV. Unless this is 4k fuckery, my game doesn't look nearly this good.
---
No way, then my character is fiucked up.
---
If I play for 30 minutes the red thirsty comes up, down 4 bottles of puiried and it'll be back 30 mins later...  nothing I can do to make that worse, I ain't downing chems for fun or anything.
---
everything in the game is farming, if you switched off your favorite gun during farming then you would never get to use it. fuck that
---
True.  Realism does not exist in this game and it does not pretend to be really.
---
Shooting Gatling Plasma? Flying Death Bats?  Mutant Green people?
---
I just accept that is one of the rules of the world in this game.  30 minutes in game time does not equate to 30 minutes in real life.
---
But yes, it uses a fair amount of food/water.   But I can use about 4 soups in an "in game" day with about 8 waters "in game" day.  Not too far really from RL.
---
&gt;fuck power armors
---
That's the spirit. Thank you for sharing your knowledge.
---
No worries, will add you anyway!
---
Y’ALL HUNGRY FOR SOME 
---
**TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD SALISBURY STEAK?**
---
OR ARE YOU HUNGRY FOR SOME NEWS?
---
(I’m guessing news.)
---
You can D:&lt; if you want
---
But I shall smile to motivate my fellow guards to stop them evil dupers whoever I see them 
---
For I am the symbol of peace! 
---
it's a good tip but I've seen legendaries refill and still not give me anything. I'll cap a vid next time.
---
Another day older and deeper in debt.
---
When I am using my low level characters I never have anyone drop supplies/aids, ect but have had them help out when I battled a higher level creature.
---
Dupers are dicks though... so goes against the grain for them not to be dicks
---
Didn’t they recently remove two?
---
Couldn't tell you, got disconnected too many times and stopped trying.
---
You need a tse mate. And  probably revotril.
---
btw wipe the levels i dont mind either, I won't rage like you are right now. if people not agree with my opinion it is ok too, I am free to write whatever I want and you are just a moron who try to make a conflict from no where. Now put that pill in your mouth and use some water to pass it through, no one wants you to choke with rivo.
---
Or would you rather be a fish?
---
The seemingly intentional glitchy rock got me
---
I'm on pc and it works just fine, however don't expect to be saved by TSE melee explosions, if that is your goal
---
You already get some xp and caps for party members that complete quests, which scales with Charisma i believe. Something similar for mob kills would be nice.
---
Wanted to test how well it can tank with padded, dense, assassins and magazines. I know the plan but can't build it. :/
---
Stories like this are why I enjoy giving good stuff to lower level players.
---
we have a naughty boy here. I like your style..
---
You could also turn off some of them to clear up the clutter.
---
so what about to use your shotgun but put away your explosive perk and shotgun damage perks. I mean you could be able to tag without oneshoting
---
If this sub has any decency, we're going to send you to that list of most downvotes of all time. 
---
I have seen a cat already.
---
Thanks mate, just joined. Looks good to me!
---
Well, it is, so
---
You can’t 
---
saving ? ha whats that , im not mature enough to manage my future 
---
You forgot maxed out Demolition Expert. All Explosive legendaries are increased by it, allowing you to double the damage on any gun with Explosive, shotguns included.
---
Sorry if you felt "offended" 
---
My tse can’t one hit anything am I the wrong build?
---
Can you give an update on this? I’m wondering the same thing. 
---
Well is kind of interesting.  Maybe I will shoot up a flare every time I find Grahm.   Could help something eventually I guess... After I buy all the plans I need first!
---
And grenadier too as if the blast radius was actually needed 
---
Your root level site times out:
---
https://cap.city/
---
Going to https://www.caps.city/ works fine.
---
I don't have an issue with other poeple playing PvP. I'm just saying it doesn't fit and doesn't make sense considering all the other players would have technically been your neighbors in the vault.
---
There would be good ways to add PvP though. If there were factions you could join were you could hunt poeple in the opposite faction it would work pretty nice while leaving poeple who don't want to PvP alone.
---
I could easily imagine becoming a ghoul being as easy as being within the blast zone of a nuke when it detonates. You have, say,  a 25% chance of surviving and becoming a ghoul.
---
Perhaps this event would start a quest leading you to a method of curing it, although once unlocked, you are free to just ignore it and to embrace your mutation.
---
Being a ghoul could act as an alternative to both power armor and hazmat suits, allowing you to walk into blast zones with your outfits and armor.
---
I have letters. Ps4?
---
On mobile right now, so I don’t have access to my screen caps, but as I was playing tonight, I found two guys roaming together with several hundred cap bounties a piece. 
---
One was 800+ and I’m fairly certain the other was over 1k. Highest I’ve seen so far and made sure to check my map often just in case they were headed my way.
---
You could also just try to find a White Springs without too many people. Or avoid the people there and try to beat them to the spawn points. Annoying, but not maybe not as much as re-speccing just to fit the meta. Plus, you can clean houses pretty quick while they'd be blowing themselves up in such tight quarters (you'll notice a lot of them do their fighting outdoors where they can jump to avoid the explosions)
---
Gimmie dem tongs
---
I dont use the demolishion perks or shotgun perks unless fighting the queen, instead I use the 2H Melee perks and makeshift warrior because the shotgun is strong enough without perks but due to my mutations and stats it still hits for around 500.
---
TY for the tip; upvoted
---
Yeah, but none of your friends can enjoy the fruits of your labors in fo4
---
Mine still works. I spawn half in my foundation kinda, but jumping fixes that. I spawn just inside my camp door. 
---
Good catch. Need to fix this... For now I will update this post! Thanks!!
---
^ this!  Dunno what's a good way to prevent the CAMP griefers from simply destroying player vendors.
---
However budget isnt just some arbitrary number they made up, its dependent on the number of polygons and complexity of each object, which is why turrets take up a good portion, they are complex objects, now ive heard some say lighting does too, not sure, never really plonked more than one light down before, but itd be a similar idea, lighting aint cheap, more lights, more calculations, harder on performance. So keeping that in mind, they could decrease the budget on turrets and cap the max, however this still needs to be balanced against all the other objects, turrets taking up less space means more space for other objects, thus more polygons to render, thus decrease in performance.
---
When/where was 200 promised anywhere?
---
How about weapons? In real life I have a wood axe I have had for 10 years, sharpen it once every now and then, its never broken. I go through 2 hoards of fleshy ghouls and it's broken a quarter  in game.
---
Was in the army about 10 years, 5 in one place,  and had same weapon that I put thousands of rounds through, never needed anything but a clean and oil lol :-)
---
Nice but I’ll still prefer the multi purpose axe 
---
Just like real life
---
Ya I love using less powerful stuff when other people are around, better odds that everyone can get a tag in 👍my new fave is my Suppressor Cryolator with +25% Rate of Fire. Nerfs everything it touches so everyone else can get their hits in, but still packs a half decent punch.
---
Plus it shoots snowballs!! 😁 which looks extra wonderful in my Christmas Lights T-51b. Nuke Zones have become snowball fights for me and I love it
---
That suggestion was from day one and it's a system in most of MMORPG but whatever.
---
so it is 100% imposible to you replace one 3 stars perk str for another with carry weight and carry another shotgun common just for tagging? I mean I'm pretty sure it is a good choose. I don't want to force you play different but with this kind weapons you mostly ruin others experience. and I have done it that is why I don't want this happen anymore. it fucking sucks. so for now until a patch or something, will you lose something by try different things? and if you don't want to do it. it is ok too no one will tell you anything except those who you screw by oneshooting everything.
---
I’ve encountered Moth Man twice. Once while randomly questing in The Forest and the other at my base outside of Whitesprings. Note: I’ve never dealt with or held any of his eggs.
---
The first time I saw him, he just jumped up and vanished. The second, I fast traveled to my base to find him there, in a battle to the death with my cheap little turrets. He stuck around, teleported all over the place (thank you VATS + Recon Scope), and I eventually killed him. Have a screen cap on my PC of him dead + his loot. Spoiler: he dropped nothing special, and his body disappeared seconds after I took the screen cap.
---
I think we ment to say "Have WE tried ATOM RPG yet, comrade?"
---
Good to see that people learned nothing about betas that happen 4 weeks before release. 
---
Chainsaw is super fun I paired it with the clown outfit and sack with straps mask and had a chameleon effect on my armor. Then i'd sneak up on players pull out the chainsaw let them hear it and look around then stand up and rev the shit out of it. Good times.
---
Yeah it seems like that. I also heard you can get the team bonus for some of the perks just by inviting someone to a team, in the time where they haven't accepted yet. I haven't tested that out myself.
---
Unfortunately, you will run into players like this every now and again. I was playing with two friends earlier. Me and my low level friend were clearing an area out and this level 150+ in full power armor with an explosive gatling gun started picking at us while we were distracted. I let my low level friend run to their base to drop their loot off in case something happened while I tried to wave and be friendly with the player. He kept attacking and the chip damage was surprisingly rapid because of the power of his gun. I refused to waste the aid supplies it would have taken to keep recovering, so I let him kill me. He walks over, crouches, and our third friend finally shows up (also a level 150+) and halves the griefers health with his two shot weapon. Dude panics and disconnects from the server immediately. Guess he thought he would be able to pick on low levels still working on their builds until one of the big boys showed up and he had to fight someone his own size! 
---
While I have a few stories like that I could share, I have met and interacted with plenty of friendly players as well. People who help, invite you to their groups, visit your base with you (had a nice guy build me some water purifiers!), tag along on quests even though they already completed them or aren't quite there yet. Good, solid players. 
---
Best thing you can do in this situation is switch servers. I think you can also ignore players, too, which makes you invisible to them, I believe!
---
Lmao ya I'm debating about taking my Grenadier off just to cut back on blowing myself up so much
---
Fallout 76 multiplayer experience is probably the most well-spirited and non-toxic among any other online games I've played. Over 80 hours I've been only attacked once, and probably randomly by mistake. 
---
I think you can just put a bayonet on it
---
You’re right. This is just meant to be another idea to be considered on their end as they try to make everyone happy. Unfortunately, someone will always be unhappy... but feedback helps them improve while people still have interest.
---
So what’s your thoughts on Mods being scrapped as part of their programming? 🤣🤣🤣
---
Explosive weapons need to do less damage.
---
Twin shot and explosive both need to be reworked.
---
They are both so far and ahead better than any other traits that it's unimaginable how they are still in the game in their current incarnations.
---
Imo: explosive and Twin shot should be receiver mods with custom ammo.
---
Most of the traits should be mods. Traits should be left for the intangible benefits. Armor while reloading. Move speed  while your magazine if fully loaded.
---
Melee weapons need a similar suite of mods and traits. Move speed while blocking. etc. etc.
---
If pvp is ever going to be a thing then something needs to happen bc most engagements last about .4 seconds or less if there are more people.
---
Oh well if it's a glitch I don't see the point in making a build round it. Glitches get patched most of the time so it would ruin the build
---
Unlike FO4, camps are not settlements.  So my philosophy has changed in FO76 in that I set up my camp based on how far I need to crawl when I am overencumbered and/or need to repair weapons/armor and as a free fast travel target back into an area, or to farm some resource.  I keep it si pale and small, built a 1x2 foundation with 1 of every workshop and a bed on the second floor, a turret on each corner and a roof.  I have a pair of generators on an external platform just to power a few lights and a water purifier.  Easy to place when I move as there seems to be a shortage of flat ground everywhere I want to be.  I don’t see a need to farm plants as I get enough from exploring to eat.  This took 3 characters (all retired before lvl 50) to fine tune to MY way of playing.  So take your time and figure out what/where you camp structure/placement serves YOU best.
---
Magic, got it.
---
I dont know, but it sounds like a hell of a time lol
---
Yes, agree on all points.   But the game is not intended to duplicate real life or even come close to it.
---
Thanks for your service!   
---
Parts of the story is missing here.
---
Why did you give the heart emote in the first place?  You shoot him first thus triggering the PVP challenge and he just accepted the challege and shot you in face killing you?
---
Then works as intended.  If you were just leveling up and did not mean PVP, then turn on Pacifist. Simple.
---
Level 96 here and never been killed by anyone.  Yes, I have been shot at multiple times, no biggie, stims keep me alive just fine if I don't enter PVP mode.
---
Are are you just complaining that he shot you once and you did not die?  Again, no biggie.
---
Hell, I wish there was a "im shot and dying" emote.   I would do that often when someone accidentally shoots me or intentionally shoots me.  It would be funny.
---
356 hours played and I still haven’t run out of things to do, places to explore, missions to complete etc because it’s much more fun to take your time and enjoy the ride, I’m def not in any hurry
---
Well thankfully i havent managed to scrap a mod i didnt want accidently, and I heard about it happening well and truly before then, so whenever i find a mod i want, i install it before i do anything else. But yeah it really shouldnt be happening, Not without some kind of warning and especially not before bulk items
---
Honestly I think it'd be awesome if it were available as a skin for the hazmat suit.
---
(it was an ice pick, i believe, but still +1)
---
Am I real?
---
Because they are placed at one location.
---
It might be more interesting if we can loot that in containers
---
I've agroed them just standing near and not shooting.  If they hit you instead of the mob they will agro to you.
---
If I have to display my account name and be visible magically to everyone else on the map at all times, I want a GPU tracker installed in Pete Hines' skull and the code for it made public :P
---
Praise be the Wise Mothman.
---
His knowledge will set you free..... and give you a 5% XP bonus.
---
Well, what in the fuck 
---
Their conscience?
---
Indeed, but it detracts from the enjoyment of the game, it doesn't add to it.
---
And they have put it in to add a level if reality to it, that's what they told us, I just want it a bit more realistic in that respect.. 
---
While I definitely won't sacrifice an extra 30% melee damage to carry a 2nd useless shotgun to tag enemies I will continue my current method for being fair without being forced to sacrifice my build and play style. I just wait until all the enemies I see are pretty damaged from other players and then obliterate them all. The only problem with this is that people who were fighting something 100ft away think that they are entitled to tag the enemies where my friends and I are. I agree that those of use using TSE weapons should let others tag the enemies but I also think people have the expectation that no one finishes anything off but them when the fact is no one gets to tag everything. If I kill 1 enemy that soneone didn't tag then they now think I'm just blowing everything away and not considering other players.
---
True but I normally name my character by that they do. for example my heavy gun build is called heavy, my gun slinger is masterieus stranger and my commando build is called.... You guest it commando
---
But watch out for those marsupial things. Found 3 on my piano last night.
---
Flares should allow temporary fast travel spots on the map
---
They meant, it does not "directly" reduce incoming damage.   Saying it does will complicate the matter. 
---
The only thing it directly does is prevent damage to others.  The rest is just the results of that action.
---
I was able to farm mutations yesterday pretty easily. I'd say maybe dont wear armor? Only thing I can think of that might make a difference 
---
Getting loot is probably a paid DLC in this game...
---
I always said that playing Fallout for me is like eating a very delicious  or fancy meal... I must do it Very slowly... Without any rush... Have been playing Fallout since 3 that way... I was still playing 4 the same day  76 got released.
---
It might work or it might not. I don't know. And you wouldn't need to base a build around it to utilize it if you have at least 3 points in it anyway. Also Strange in Numbers could be pretty good if you have mutations. I'll have to test it out to see if they do work when you invite someone. I need to get a bunch of card levels for my builds so extra xp would be good. Definitely great if you are on a team with your wife a lot and can swap Lone Wanderer out for them.
---
Ever since they said the 'best and brightest' it was kinda obvious that it was anything but.  It's more like the Tranquility Lane.  Eveything re-spawns, without any lasting consequence to the environment.
---
Same Problem with my PA. Everytime I enter it, the Torso is not equipped. So annoying. 
---
Like ^ this ^ guy said.. It's not just hate for the game. Beth have done a lot to ruin their own reputation here... and they have nobody to blame but themselves. Had they released a polished game with reasonable gameplay rather than a minimal effort cash grab the community would be singing their praise right now. I feel they have totally lost their shit and as sad as it makes me to say this, they have lost my respect. 
---
Were all going to get mutations, quick everyone get naked...
---
What items have you unlocked padded on? so far Ive only managed to unlock it on Combat Chest.
---
I got the PA repair card just for this purpose.   I don't use PA on a regular basis so never have the perk equipped, only get it for repairs.
---
Which mutation/s are you after?
---
It'll be stored for later. You'll still level.
---
Combat Chest, Metal Limbs and Robot Chest.
---
Thanks for all your help I reposted my commando build but here is the link if you are interested in looking at it.

Represent the Raiders well
---
Hi, I’d like to have my studio apartment reviewed by the Wasteland Estates Homeowners Association
---
Yes it did.
---
It's more of an action shooter now.
---
If you remove the torso armor piece you are wearing it should work as normal. Also if you take note of your carry weight, it might still register that you are wearing the full set of PA.
---
Sweet I thought it would but I am at work right now hand have no way to test it. Many thanks 
---
It also happens when you leave and log back in. Ssshhhhh
---
Bonus evidence: The clock on the pip boy is almost always reclamation day!
---
Who puts Christmas decorations up during halloween?
---
A bounty in a friend camp is somewhat safe, since attacking the camp will flag you as a bounty aswell. I guess all they wanted was to lure people there and have some PvP. In the end they logged out to prevent losing 400 caps: much better joining another server and let the friend kill and earn the bounty, so he can pass the caps back like nothing ever happened.
---
I hope you didn't join our hour long SB Queen fight. It was drug out of the zone and stuck in the air so some one put there camp down and built a tower to try to climb to the queen in the air.   It was crazy.
---
Happens to me too..PS4.....if you do equip it...your carry weight doesn't go up either..you have to quit the server in the PA are restart...then carry weight is what it should be..
---
Oof wow thats so broke  
---
Ok I guess I'll just keep salvaging metal limbs.     
---
    
---
Or did you get it through plans only?
---
If the perk you want does not unlock until later, you will not be able to use it until you use saved perk points up to that level.
---
Soon as Bethesda finds a fix for all the dupers, then the server stability will be fine.
---
I like your spirit mate
---
I better be able to get a pet deathclaw
---
Ty lol
---
Hey get yourself a Tesla rifle it tags almost ever ghoul you can see cause it chains to other enemy 😇
---
Thanks! Didnt know that did that.
---
Also, how come we can die over and over again??? How can we teleport to the other side of the map??? All the glitches and bugs: Glitches in the matrix!!! It's not the game that's bugged. It's the simulation that's bugged!!!
---
Not sure. I just have a combat chest plan on mr, it may have all been from plans, didn't really pay attention when I unlocked them.
---
Ty. Did not know that was a thing lol.
---
Dupers
---
Thankies. Was unaware of that benefit.
---
My simple raider mind can’t understand this 
---
That’s metagaming and I am trying to avoid out of game analyses.  
---
I don't think they wanted to have pvp since they were using explosive weapons and killing everyone on sight in one hit.
---
Somebody already had my username, so I added 69, now I gotta go around with 69 in my name as a girl character, it is embarrassing, I'm playing an old lady.
---
killed plenty of three star legendaries that have refilled their health and they dropped just meat.  I've have also one shot plenty too and they droped legendaries so thats not the problem.
---
Honestly cores are so common it ends up being a problem later on
---
Weird it’s never removed mine 
---
Yea, my bad, apparently people get but hurt when you don't read the entirety of the post... For that I apologise for not reading it through and I apologise for the ignorant comments that came after that post.. ☮️
---
Always I think, I always pick up everything around a vendors own shop and sell it to them too, always have, just pre war money and ammo you can't I think...
---
I dont understand your Perk-Part.  
---
Do AP regen perks work in PA or not? Actionboy for example. 
---
And about what maps are you talking? The treasure maps? So I guess waiting for lvl 50 before searching the treasures is useful from this point of view too. 
---
Honestly while I love my TSE Shotgun I kind of wish they werr never in the game at all. All PvP and PvE is ruined for thise with and without TSE weapons. 
---
Slow and steady wins the race 
---
He randomly appeared tonight after I fast traveled to cabin near the munitions factory. Mothman was level 45 and I was level 105. I as able to kill it and when I looted I got the spinning arrows and nothing ever appeared. Relatively uneventful.
---
You can already get a pet deathclaw.....
---
No prob
---
Q:
---
My friend keeps telling me that I need Jesus, but I don't understand what he means. Why do I need Jesus?
---
A:
---
I’m thankful for your friend’s concern; he obviously cares about you, and he senses that something is missing in your life—something only God can supply. I pray that you’ll take your friend’s concern seriously.
---
Why do you need Jesus? You need Him first of all because you need His salvation. You see, you aren’t here by accident; God created you, and He put you here for a reason. In fact, He loves you, and life’s greatest joy comes from knowing that God is your friend, and that He is with you every day. I often quote Jesus’ words: “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full” (John 10:10).
---
The problem is that we have ignored God and gone our own way, and as a result we are separated from Him—both now and in eternity. The Bible calls this “sin”—and our greatest need is to have our sins forgiven and cleansed. But how can this happen? Only God can forgive us—and He made this possible by sending His only Son, Jesus Christ, into the world for us. By His death on the cross Jesus took upon Himself the judgment that you and I deserve. God loves you that much!
---
But you also need Jesus for your life right now. You need His guidance and wisdom, and you also need His comfort and hope when hard times come (and they will). You also need strength to avoid temptations that will destroy you, and you need His help to live as you should. By a simple prayer of faith turn to Jesus and give your life to Him today.
---
Ask Jesus into your life.
---
Oh man that's some serious nightmare material.
---
I ate a cat 
---
I learned Polymer mod from scrapping a Combat Armor Leg.    Just make sure you have Scrapper and Super Duper equipped when doing this, save some of the hassle.
---
That would explain it thanks, didn't realise turrets used up so much budget!
---
So are their servers just trash then? Because I’ve built monumental ark bases that are practically military fortress’s and those servers can hold 100 people doing the same thing. Also I can build gigantic vaults that are housing hundreds of thousands of materials as well. Are they using outdated engines? I’m honestly just curious what’s holding them back. 
---
Mothman is a shining beacon of hope in this irradiated hellhole. Everyone wants him dead. We can't have that. Join me. Together we will protect the legend himself. Join me. The Mothman cannot be harmed. Join me. The Mothman will be protected. Join me. If we successfully protect The Mothman from predators and the non-believers, Mothman will help us ascend to a higher level of being. Join me. Do not fear. Mothman. Join me.
---
Opposes shall be smitten with the wrath of fury from my following.

---
No in fact you said again and, so, implemented and made powerfull what I already said. You did nothing wrong man! It's all ok
---
Love this game, I'm just taking my time and enjoying exploring
---
Unbalanced and frustrating for sure, but still PvP. This is the game right now, it will change later like any MMOish game through patches and expansions.
---
Shoot him anyways because we are raiders 
---
locating camp on the right side of map tends to increase scorchbeast attacks for me. I also tend to  experience more frequent attacks the longer it’s in a location. ( scorchbeast and others)
---
That's an odd request.  You know you can scrap stuff in your camp, right?  Or even just store it?
---
So is this how we explain why F76 is so buggy and bad.
---
It's a simulation that's fun with friends
---
I believe you mean "less PVP" until they fix the TSE.
---
However, I found that FO4 becomes a completely different feel of a game in VR.   Recommend getting VR if you enjoy Skyrim and FO4.   
---
I have not gotten the Skyrim VR yet, but its on wishlist for the next sale.
---
I am with your brother, we shall cleanse this wasteland of the non-believers and bring to glory of the mothman into the world.  
---
Praise be his name....
---
This is why i always invite everyone into a team.
---
Yes i have to look for a link but someone datamined fallouts code and found certain perks even though they don't say it wont work with PA Serendipity which you can try. And ALL AP regen perks will not work one exception is that Nerd Rage a perk will give you the damage buff but not AP regen in power armor. This is because there are mods for PA that increase AP regen 
---
There are hundreds of factors that go into deciding on the budget, I dont know all the factors, and I dont know anything about Ark and how its handled, server or client side, so yeah can't really answer that, but to wait, they obviously will have started off with a very conservative budget to ensure nothing (more than it already has) goes wonky. Much like the stash, I think you'll see increases as time goes on.
---
Yes, this very much. They ought also to tweak the effect so it mainly affects the darkest areas of the image. I feel it doesn’t do enough in really dark rooms.
---
What if fo76 is kept running until fo5 is announced. And then they include a new quest line where you have to break free of the simulation/complete it. Then when you're done, everything goes black and the game just ends. When you start a new game in fo5, you see yourself exit one of the VR simulation pods of the FO universe. You are in some sort of a facility in disrepair. You meet someone there that helped you break out of the simulation.
---
What happened, is that you voluntarily took part of the simulation, and the simulation was started before the war began. Unfortunately, the bombs dropped when you were still inside the simulation. I don't know what happened to the facility, but everyone wound up dead, and thus there was nobody to trigger the end of the simulation. That's why we kept on having to kill the scorched queen over and over again. You were supposed to be pulled out after you killed the queen, but there was nobody around to do it. So you were stuck in the simulation, repeating the last task you were given, over and over again, hoping that something would change, until someone found the facility and helped you break out of the simulation. 
---
You survived in the simulation for hundreds of years, because the facility was not a vault, and thus not radiation proof, so you became a ghoul. If a ghoul can live in a fridge for hundreds of years, then a ghoul can live ina simulation pod for hundreds of years.
---
That's not all, add in adrenaline gland along with unyielding pieces, party boy with whiskey, and a few other odds n ends and you can get the damage over 80 points per tick, ticking multiple times a second and 1-2 shotting glowing ghouls as you speed demon your way through whitesprings.  Going to try 2-3 manning a SQB this weekend and see how quickly it decimates her HP.
---
I also noticed this, must be a recent change? I love it though!
---
You ruined the lad. COD?! My God man.
---
According to all the flyers in my letter box, the NBN is getting hooked up in my area of Perth next month.
---
ouch.
---
Get a jetpack and come back and say the same thing:D
---
I started having this problem with my T-51b set.  I think if you put the set down.  
---
Transfer it all out and transfer it back it might work out.  Let me know how it works for you.
---
Do the bags have a "time for life"?
---
Do the bags stay alive until the owner logs out?
---
Do the bags persist until someone loots them?
---
I see a lot of good suggestions have been made. Do not forget for some reason a legendary weapon will fall away from their body sometimes. So it will not be in the inventory of the legendary you just killed. Not sure if this can happen with armor aswell.
---
I save a level 5 being attacked by a level 50 he was destroying his camp with a super sledge. Just as he turned on him I fired a shot from my pipe rifle then switched to a homemade. 
---
Used escape artist to disappear then stealth critical his ass to oblivion.
---
Help the guy move, rebuild, put up defence and left resources for him to use. 
---
Can't wait to have more hero moments.
---
crap, now there's dozens and 14s of us.
---
Ah, if on the PC, I was going to offer some studded leather, non-legendary.
---
A level 50 piece is 45/77 damage resist.  I am sure the lower levels are very decent as well.
---
Pacifist mode solves that problem so far as I am aware, I was wrecking face with an aoe revolver and didn't hurt anyone
---
lol dont feel bad I was over lvl 50 before I discovered it.
---
Yesterday i did 3queens on 3servers and did not crashed. Got some crazy lags tho. I remember beta times, bro, they did lots of good job.
---
Started my 2nd char and playing completely differently to my first (avoiding main and side missions) and have died 6 times so far, only level 5. first char is now level 92 and has died 3 times in total, as I played it safe.
---
Downside to that is as time goes on, we beat the storyline, farmed all the two-shot explosives we want, and reach level 500, and moved on to other games by then. If Bethesda wants to create a sub business selling atoms for decorations and what not, then they should consider fixing the foundation of their business model (the budgets for camps) before trying to desperately take peoples money and deliver a subpar service.
---
I’ve experienced this, it’s awful and normally it’s two scorchbeast. I’m in the mountains in the bottom right, maybe my location has something to do with it. 
---
Also: If you go into the training vault at Vault-Tec University all the signs say 'simulation in progress'. I know there's an in-game explanation for this but I'd like to think that it's part of some wider conspiracy theory. :) 
---
Sales terminal at Red Rockets
---
Scrapped items with 0 value have to be bulked to be sold to vendors.  Other scrapped materials have value without being bulked, so there are no bulked versions of them.  
---
Gold, silver, fiber optics, fiberglass spools, etc.  These can be sold without bulking (and you cannot bulk them).
---
Thanks. Here are a few I'm working on. I don't think they are final yet but I'm getting close I think to some build that I can keep.

If they just realized lots of low priced stuff would make us bleed atoms.
---
Not going to discuss that, just answering what I can on the technical side.

Just have items count against stash limit until sold.

I usually don't crash, but Queens have been CTDing me today without fail. I haven't completed one. Super glad I put in the effort to do the nukes.
---
Yes brother. We shall. Together. We shall. Glory to be. Together. Praise be. Together. Praise.
---
Praise The Mothman.
---
Its well done, especially considering on trying to build on a non-flat terrain.  Anyone that wants to make nice looking CAMPs regardless of outcomes is cool in my book!
---
IMO not useful only for early game leveling of your LUCK skill, Since alot of good perks for both your build and a luck build come into play i ususually run these at low levels until either level 50+ i get all luck perks i need for the build
---
Im down for it.. if this is on pc
---
Any melee build, especially low hp/high rad builds do just fine without power armor especially the way armor penetration works right now.  When outside nuke zones they CAN use unyielding pieces for more STR but they don't have to.  Unarmed is particularly fun because you can't use your weapon of choice in PA.  I have a level 101 unarmed build that has done everything, including SBQ, in nothing but a hazmat suit.  I used to repair them, but getting mats for that got annoying so now I just go to emmets, the radioactive workshop to the south, or one of the nuke silos and grab new ones as needed when they wear out.  Also when your hazmat suit breaks it still works until you take it off but instead of making rads under 1 per tick, it sets rads to 1 per tick, so just reduced effectiveness.
---
It could be a newer bug with the frame. Try a different chassis/frame?
---
Wait so you can get weapons with more then one legendary effect?!?!?!
---
I paid 60$ and I feel like I’ve gotten my money’s worth already 
---
Bobblehead displays and magazine racks would be a great start. 
---
Yet another reason to hate the proliferation of two shot explosive weapons... 
---
Trotsky is more about pickaxe than hatchet.
---
Perks are meant to be swapped depending on your needs, you put on the scrapper one only if you're about to scrap things. I have a full crafting build I use only on my CAMP. Our hope is that Bethesda provide some kind of build preset manager, as right now swapping card per card is a pain
---
I disagree to an extent.  I have four toons, a stealth vats silenced assault rifle user, a 2 hand melee power armor wrecker, an unarmed sneak unyielding, and a flamethrowing team synergy healer.  All but the heal can one ahot everything up to scorchbeasts/queens.  The melee (both can double [crit] hit kill the scorchbeasts and the assaulter can kill in about 1 clip spamming vats crits.  In pvp they have all one shot player.  Ive tried the TSE on my rifler with full perks and with/without demo expert.  I feel they are all very very comparable.  
---
Imo the easiest solution to not being a dick is as op said in a comment "unequip perk cards".  Everytime im uranium fever i drop all my perks that boost my melee dmg.  Problem solved :)
---
I think to truly see how the weapons stack we would need some sort of high hp dps sponge that doesnt require 5+ people to kill where we can get an idea on kill times   i dont like using queen as an example due to lag/scaling/impossible to judge dps from all the variables.  Id love to see how weapons stack up in an even environment.  Thatd be fun.
---
Understood. This whole thing is a huge rabbit hole that can go on forever. Everything revolves around R&amp;D anyway, but my opinion is that this lacked on that and prematurely launched the game.
---
I am sure i sold a few of pretty much everything though. 
---
Yup this i deffs know but been keeping it down low cause i didnt want it nerfed TBH but since the cats outa the bag https://clips.twitch.tv/OnerousHungryBisonAMPTropPunch
---
here is the OPness of the explosive cyro
---
I caught one mutation naturally then purchased 3 others and got one from a SBQ drop. I have to say that the scariest thing in the world for me is the 10 seconds between taking off the Starched Gene's perk to drink the serum because I am so scared I am going to lose the mutations. It cost SOOO many caps to buy them....
---
25 years have elapsed, post nuclear war residents could have done it.
---
Sadly nah but my original pitch is to get this to be a thing so we can have some good honest hunter VS hunted
---
only if you use guns
---
Golf balls (Whitespring), nuka cups w/straws (Camden Park), plastic plates (Lewisburg dining pavilion). 
---
People are just fast traveling after they get their quick legendary drops.
---
Things slow down after the initial waves and then they Fast Travel.
---
Sometimes it leaves a ghost empty frame with the Forever-Spinner (Spining cursor).   Just a visual bug.
---
I did have a lot of blueprints thanks to that annoying bug but just recently cleared all of that away. I'm pretty certain now it's the turrets that's the problem. Wish they'd made it a bit clearer!
---
God damn auto correct *tambo
---
Yeah I'm doing a quest for rose too and I'm stuck at a part where there is a level 50 (25 lvls higher than me) and a lvl 32.. I just can't do anything with it.. been stuck there for about a week now
---
I was defending someone's workshop against robot attackers and I threw a granade that took out a generator and an extractor which blew up a car and destroyed something else so it took me to 50. I wasn't trying to destroy anything. I try and help..not destroy.
---
Lool :D i want now rambo skin tho :D
---
I had mine on, still got wanted
---
99% of the drops in whitespring is crap :D
---
Yeah, exactly how I'm feeling right now. Nuked Whitespring recently, and some bellend with an explosive automatic rifle runs through killing absolutely everything before me and the friend who nuked could get a look in.
---
Resorted to passive mode and an automatic 10mm to just spray at everything to try and get some drops. Wasn't what we'd had in mind.
---
Will be trying some other locations too. 
---
They look good too me :). One thing I have learned is that it's best to base damage perks on one type of weapon. For example I have one build for shotguns, heavy and explosive weapons and auto rifles. I also try to keep them as close to 50 because you can worry about upgrading perks after level 50. The last one I think is a bad habit from another RPG but I can not remember it.
---
If I had a decent legendary for every 10 auto stim wood legs I had I would be a very powerful man
---
where is the ammo factory one
---

---
Why the fuck should I care about lower level players?Why should Iet them land a hit on legendary enemies?
---
When I was a lower level no one let me hit any high level enemies , so why should I let noobs hit 'em?
---
Make video of it, im interested. Explosive shotgun with some boobleheads and shit can make her die in first minute.
---
I don't think rifle gaming ever complained about the game and he was paid to advertise the website he never said he did that. Your targeting the wrong YouTuber
---
Oddly, I did not even think about this.  Excellent option!
---
If you had the limited edition pipboy it might've had more use but I found when the on screen version paused time it made more sense to see it all on the bigger screen, so you weren't missing out on much tbh
---
Dang Keith Scott you go preach the gospel, I see where you have been since one tree Hill 😁
---
Real though Amen to that!
---
There is a "view change" button that changes pip boy into transparent, so you can see what happens around you, while looking at the menu. I can't remember what is called, but try to press that.
---
Yeah don't publicise this. I only ever had 1 core for about 20 levels.. 
---
Yeah, ice pick through temple.
---
Were you maybe with a team yesterday that was sharing perks with you?
---
Where is the proof he's running it?
---
It’s halfway to a decent game. They have a long way to go. It is very fun when it works and you don’t get stuck somewhere stupid or have an insane amount of lag or frame rate drop. The disconnection issues I don’t see being a problem in the future. But it seems like there are a lot of small issues they need to take care of. One that drives me crazy is why they got rid of the welcome mat for our camps. So now anytime anyone fast travels to my camp they are stuck under the floors. I understand a lot of small issues will get over looked for now until the big ones are taken care of but it does seem like sometimes they are focusing on the wrong issues like solving petty glitches and things that don’t actually effect the gameplay at all. If they keep working on updates and listening to what players want. I could see this becoming a pretty good game. 
---
I was yeah
---
Ask a high lvl friend to grab a hazmat in a silo for you. they are lvl 1 and spawn in the nuclear reactor room
---
I try to buy the fuckers won't trade or pick my shit up lol
---
Lol yeah I assume I've just been super unlucky, didn't see the Flatwoods Monster until level 70 or so when I was fighting a Scorchbeast in the Bog and I hear a 'wubwubwub' sound, caught me off guard but was a really cool three-way fight. 
---
Im runnin a stealth crippler build that is pretty much invisible to the enemy. Big damage multipliers from sneak attacks turn my shotgun into a 1-2 shot kill for most anything in the game.
---
Anything left standing isnt standing for long either.
---
I run with the speed demon mutation and my gear is almost all legendary perked for sneaking around.
---
Some noteworthy kills include your typical scorchbeast solo kill and a nice level 91 deathclaw who stood no chance. 
---
I never used power armor in any FO game. Too loud and clunky. But ya gotta admit.. Looks pretty badass!
---
Camp items only. The rest not really worth it
---
Turn on pacifist while in a blast zone
---
It is an RPG. Just because it doesn't cater to your very specific needs, doesn't make it not an RPG
---
I got the sniper outfit without paying (later payed for the duster) and I gotta say it looks pretty cool, looks a lot better than my armour at the moment but there are other outfits that are free so...
---
Honey pot trap. They would of used the bounty as bait. If they had finished what they were doing they would been somewhere random in the world waiting for someone to engage the wanted level. Then his friends pop out to kill the attacker. 
---
It sounds like you caught them during the setup, and now that their base location had been compromised they left as you can destroy someone's base with no consequence if you are actively in pvp with them or they are wanted. 
---
I have bought two outfits and rest have gone to the camp items. Not using real money.
---
I think that's why they are beginning to banning people who duplicate. As it gets rid of the trouble makers but keeps the people who what to play and have a good time with each other. The only problem is how you can tell weather if a weapon is a duplicate or not . Would be very bad if a player got banned for getting a op gun ligitly.
---
I don't think it's being a dick to use your regular weapon. It seems silly to expect them to kill mobs less efficiently.
---
What do you mean trickle? I earn more atoms than I can spend..
---
Damnit. 3 points action boy for nothin ;-)
---
You get ultracite mod plans from the scorchbeast queen. 
---
Rad away, rad-x, and stimpaks increase hunger and thirst just like all the other chems. Some folks forget this and end up needing to eat and drink way more without realizing. 
---
Define "reality"
---
You get the plans for ultracite mods from the scorchbeast queen
---
Queen loot
---
Not new. Items that are non-bulkable are sellable. 
---
Yeah I've picked up a grand total of 1 Flamer my entire playtime so far. Stupid me sold it...i recall it being a good Legendary effect, too.
---
What do you mean "as a shotgun replacement"? Why would I need a minigun/gatling gun if I already have a .50 Cal?
---
Agreed.  The abuse of the TSE has made it so they really need to make Passive mode take zero damage from PVP as well.
---
Honestly power armor is nice for the damage resists but it's better to just run armor
---
I once killed a 3 star legendary hermit crab very slowly ( you can't one shot a hermit crab). He regained HP. And he just dropped common stuff. 
---
Everything is heavier except for 2 items when bulked.   I only bulk anything when selling.
---
Who knows Mr Anderson...
---
Fish lamp and power armor skins for the first free 4000 or so atoms
---
Wait, just re-read that. They weren't sharing damage related cards. Just armour and rad resistance stuff. I'm taking about after playing solo. Lever action rifle, no high damage receiver, all rifleman cards maxed out and I was doing 120 damage. This morning it's down to 72
---
So you attack Some1 workshop and go destroy it's base for the lulz? Not cool
---
I must be lucky I got a two shot 50 cal machine gun the other day. I am waiting for something big to use it on like a over grown eat with wings for example lol
---
"Guys, with this code it will now randomly flip the orientation of the toilet roll, as well as allowing for variations in the ply of the roll"
---
"But what about the bugs"
---
"Oh don't worry, this bit of the code is fine"
---
Yeah me too, but it's not *my* cat. 😜
---
The issue is that the game scales enemies to the level of the first person to go through an area.  If a lv60+ player walked through the area, it would have spawned those high level enemies and if nobody kills them, they'll just stay there.
---
Bought Harley quin face paint, duster clothing, the black bird power armor painjob, vault tec leather armor paint (fucking dumb thought its for all amor) and some icons etc.  Curently i have 2000atoms (doing daily/weekly challenges) and waiting for something super cool to show in Atom shop.
---
I’ve received Power plans ( leg, torso , helm)from the queen drop but never mods , how often do they spawn?
---
Bethesda grief us by making this laughable 'PvP', so I'll exploit it until they actually do something worthwhile about it.
---
Wendigo cave ? 
---
Each star is a legendary effect. Only one is written in the name, so you have to inspect the weapon to see the other(s).
---
Source: killed myself testing my new two shot plasma Gatling that happened to be explosive too. -_-'
---
Find a friend when you hit a nuke zone, party up, clear the area.  But wait, there is definitely more!  After you have cleared the Whitesprings clubhouse, quit to menu, then go to social, find your friend on your friendslist, click join, when you spawn back into the parking lot outside the clubhouse (unless people were inside the building, on the roof, too close to the doors) all the mobs inside will respawn and you can keep killing non-stop all night.  
---
BONUS TIP! The glowing ones will keep spawning LONG after the nuke has dissipated so you can then farm without even using a hazmat/PA if you are careful.
---
Enjoy!
---
Yep. Tried it again last night with a random and we both got splatted
---
They are removing all the duplicated weapons from the game...no, just joking(and dreaming), I have no idea. Was the nuke problem solved already?
---
You must be laughing when a high level player comes at you with a rare weapon. And you turn round and oblitorate the with a pipe rifle xD
---
Not sure what is up but they haven't mentioned it on their official site, twitter, or Bethesda server status page.
---
Yes! It would be nice to have an off button on the jukebox as well, Instead of it just changing the song (of which there are so few) but it would be great to have it work more as a radio!
---
Play in pacifist? You could shoot all the walls
---
YouTubers just blow everything out of proportion for views so their sheep audience will follow
---
Guess it's just up to rng. I've killed her twice and each time got a plan to build a power armor piece and a plan to build a mod.
---
Explosive vents every fucking time, had 18of them, throw away. Friend killed her over 100times still dont have jetpack, so um you have to farm it till you die farming. But then you make more money than Trump have.
---
Yep got kicked several times today at different times. 
---
"I was just reading the forums, and found out the people ~~want~~, will pay for an accident/sorry emote."
---
I have seen the cultist machete mod on the Harper's Ferry vendor and the BoS vendor in Watoga.  I have two stashed away waiting to get my hands on a nice 3 star machete.
---
I don't have one and would hate to lose my TS 50 cal machine gun
---
Yeah but i feel for armor to be really viable defense wise is to take those damn armor perks (iron clad) stuff like that when i can spend towards damage reduction points
---
I sometimes buy camp things but that is rarely and I pick and choose. Only bought the light laminate and the modern fireplace. Maybe get the dark laminate.
---
Other wise I just let the atoms pile up.
---
It's a good thing you can earn 50 a day and 200 a week aside from your normal challenges..
---
Lmao!!
---
Floor skins, the only missing in game. You can find the most beautiful looking walls in game and then you're forced to use the default floor. I'd say it's a must buy, bought the brown parquet and synthetic herb for my outside garden. Well spent atoms imho
---
Because you're not forced to be as stupid as the stupidest person you met.
---
Noticed that vendors and empty power suits were having issue, maybe causing worse instability?
---
Gots to keep grinding away I guess !! thanks all who answered, appreciate it!!!
---
Scrounger, and perks like it give a definite %-chance for finding their type of loot based on the level of the perk (LUCK score is not used).  Hard Bargain (the trading perk) doesn't give an exact amount but the trading porices are even worse than in 4; you're generally just better off dropping unwanted loot on the ground.  Scrapper has been nerfed into the ground.  Instead of giving rarer components, it just increases the amount of common components (mostly wood, steel, and rubber) gained from scrapping.
---
Yeah. If you can play every day that is. I only get to play once a week. I'm always too busy with work and Life. Lol
---
Yeah but i like high agility for vats so consider escape artist and the one that helps you sneak upto level 2. I like the vats+melee+grim sprint+crit savvy mob runs
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/qoe1kih
---
Yeah I'm just saying those min max builds run very glass builds. I personally don't like pa so when I'm solo I use alot of damage reduction perks
---
The glow in the dark map and succulents. I really love maps, and the succulents are a good size to decorate with.
---
Other than those, I'm saving my atoms...I don't know what would get me to spend them.
---
Ya kinda, it took a few days. Just want to talk about Fallout, the modding community mean a lots to me so I want to ease out the negativity a bit.
---
Next time you nuke something off the beaten path make sure you do the forced respawn trick by being in a party, clearing all mobs, quit to main menu, rejoin your friend via social menu, when you get back in if everyone was out of the areas the mobs spawn they all come back.
---
Adrenaline reaction mutation? Any armor adding +3 to SPECIALS when on low health? Be aware that playing a low life glass cannonish is the very end game right now and can skyrocket your damage
---
I have seen this happen as well. The other day I was at Watoga shopping center. In the alleys behind it there will spawn a legendary protectron sometimes. Walked over to kill it. Got a legendary drop but afterward all the bots in that alley had a legendary drop. But they were normal protectrons. Not kidding I got 6 legendary drops back to back. Hasn't happend since though.
---
Lewisburg is always good, thanks for the other spots. I'll be bulking plastic at this rate
---
Yup.  I had the same complaints about most mmorpg.  People always rush endgame content and then complain there is no endgame.  I remember vanilla wow, god it was so fun and so slow.  Getting a new level was an achievement, crafting at low levels meant something (loved me my scoepid armour on my hunter).  Power leveling is not for me.
---
I spoke to my mate about this as I'm level 22 and he's level 40 we only really team up to farm screws and materials rather than do quests cause you just miss so much.
---
Lol still can earn them in game I finished today's dailies I think in 30 minutes? Because 1 person can't log in 30 minutes daily doesn't mean it's not a good system. They could have made them have 0 ways to earn anything like most companies. I have to commend them because it's more fair then most gaming companies
---
Ya, my floors are hideous, I've been eyeing the floor skins for a while. 
---
Well I hope those were TSE weapons that got nerfed if that is the case.
---
I was tempted by the seasonal stuff - santa outfits etc. But the price was too cray cray.
---
It's all to do with good lighting and being clever with Photomode. Here's the pics direct from my Xbox Profile.
---
I take a lot of Portrait shots so expect ALOT of sideways screenshots 🙂
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/zero-fox-fk/screenshots
---
Been having controls disabled every 10 seconds for the past 5 minutes. Server crashed 10min prior then game crashed shortly after rejoining game... sigh... someone need to tell Bethesda to wake up their hamsters powering the servers
---
User urges hypothetical people to not be a dick while delivering statement in fantastic dickish manner. Quality posts nowadays.
---
For the record I make sure to switch off my E double barrel during legendary spawning events.
---
I only spend them on camp items,. But since atoms are stupid easy to get(I average 100 a day) , I've just been hoarding them until something big comes 
---
Yup. Happens to me a lot as well. Try using the PA headlamp to attract attention to the paper bag. Had a real hard time giving away stimpacks last night :-) Will keep trying though. 
---
It would have been funny if that was actually just a note to remind the devs
---
My thanks too :)
---
True that. I'm not saying they're hard to earn. I actually usually forget all about them 😂🤣
---
Would you say that melee is the most fun way to go about this game. Im only level 10 and I still don’t have any idea what Im doing.
---
Yes, I will do those, thank you.
---
Sorry but idk. I've never kept track of my plans
---
Last time i walked into a blast zone outside of the usual 2... everything inside of it was dead. The nuke literally killed all of the scorched there and didn't spawn new ones.  😭
---
(The nuke literally just happened after I walked in,  so no it wasnt players who killed them)
---
Cool thanks for the info and lol I had that happens to me in fallout 4. I got a exsplosives assault rifle and fired in a gas filled room with exsplosives barrels.
---
The game crashed shortly after the flash of light lol.
---
mutation serums...cheap...riiiiiighhttttt
---
I just completed all Roses quests at level 30 the lvl 32 wendigo I blasted with a shit ton of grenades to kill it. 
---
They completely missed the ball on the RNG in this game. Too much of character progression relies on it without any mitigation. Be it bonus perk cards or legendary items, there should be a way to "dust" them to slowly garantee wanted loot.
---
Aaallrighty Uncle Atombags, no need to rub it in ;)
---
I just mean that you get atoms for pretty much everything initially.
---
Equip a weapon... atoms. 
---
Drink a nuka cola... atoms.
---
Sneeze... atoms.
---
As you explore the game inevitably that's going to slow down. Not everyone is into doing the daily/weekly challenges and either way, they don't yield nearly as many as that initial atom dump that comes from just playing the game.
---
Actually I was after the Plan: Ice machine, but thanks.
---
Aha
---
SBQ has like 80% resistance to explosives...
---
Can u add me? stasikanone- i would like to buy the ts 10mm 
---
hope you got enough to constantly repair them, she one shots them
---
You already got so many fast travel possibilities: your camp, your friends (if added to your team) and vault 76 (all of those without paying something).
---
Lmao Im not gonna bother doing that. But thanks fo the info.
---
Going without PA makes the game tougher, but I like it.
---
That's true, but what's the point to have the ability to display them all if that turns out to be basically inusable? Reducing the text font size would help imho.
---
I always have purifiers and generators in the open.  MOBS usually love to attack my inflatible snowmen or the menacing pink flamingo.
---
Never had to repair either. They did destroy my acid gatherer once.
---
Free outfits??? Never saw any for free in atom shop, am I missing something??
---
Same problem here, started happening after last hotfix.
---
tried changing PA frame, dropping it... no luck.
---
Upsetting that you think buying women objects guarantees that they'll sleep with you.
---
opps thought i did reply. yes i did. didn’t particularly like it, played until blocked and just never got around to playing it since.
---
Just think about what you said for a second.
---
because bethesda literally catered to the fortnite and CoD crowd to fucking make F76 lol
---
It's not an RPG.
---
I have a +3 to specials piece but it's not that. Full health, no armour bonuses and it stays the same. I unequipped all my damage increase cards and re-equipped them. Nothing. Either my game is bugged or they did something. I can't find anything about it online either
---
I'm all for that - got alredy few bugged - Tapper Holodisk game doesn't count (I've even played it), Top of the world and Valley Galeria doesn't count as well as Kill Yao Guai one (I killed dozens of them).
---
This kind of inspires me.
---
I have a set of lvl 50 T-51 on one of my chassis (chassises?) and I've offered it to a few people but they are always too low level to make any use of it. I think i might sell those then start passively trying to collect lower level pieces as I'm wandering around then just drop the chassis for someone that needs it when i get a full set. :)
---
yeah trust me i'm not knocking non-PA builds my alt is gonna focus on sneaking crit build no PA. I like that min/max but i feel not viable strat if people can take your stuff.
---
Ik
---
That's not how it works, the formula is a more advanced version of the fo1/2 armor formula.  The more damage, the more penetration.
---
Oh yeah and I forgot to add to my builds but Junk Shield is pretty good and you only need to carry about 50 junk to get the maximum benefit from it, if you're interested in a non PA build with good resistance to damage.
---
Communication isnt exactly a strength at Bethesda though :)
---
That stuff is so bugged... No way it's normal that a modded laser breaks in two reloads.
---
Man this shit warms my tiny ass heart!
---
I have had MANY similar experiences after hearing numerous people say that all Fallout76 players are dickheads and trolls. 
---
I literally just had a dude GIVE me 500 Stimpaks. 
---
Literally everyone I have met so far has been awesome and helpful. 
---
I love this game.
---
You can use knives only for call of duty.
---
Still an action game.
---
Fish lamp! Seriously, I love that little guy. 
---
No I know what you mean but am at level 92 and still have over 1000 atoms just sitting there, and have bought CAMP stuff, paints, etc.. I do a lot of daily events though.. maybe that helps
---
not to mention the amount of lag that explosive spam would cause...
---
Cool. But for real, **please fix that Assaultron Head glitch!**
---
Yep.  The mirelurk kings in there are mean.   Advise just sneaking past if possible.   The wendigo itself is not too bad.
---
Yep. I like it too, and as said before, I don’t find the lack of human NPCs disturbing.
---
Loose lips sink ships... 
---
well it's an action rpg.
---
You can do the "Enlightened Path" event at the lighthouse and it will give you the good Mothman.
---
Sounds good especially as some junk when broke down weight a small amount. Would have to be something that people don't find that useful so if you do die from a player the will be less likely to pick it up
---
Hooooly Shit lolol 
---
It's cause you are mashing too many chems...? Stimming will make you hungry and thirsty. Also watch out for those food parasites they will make you hungry all the time.
---
There are some endurance perks that solve the hunger or thirst thing more or less permanently at level 3.
---
Food is everywhere in the game herbivore mutation and cannibal are good for eating raw stuff and once you have a decent garden and green thumb perk it gets really easy...
---
&gt;Comment asDuukDkarn
---
Agreed, each of the resource gatherers there store 40 concrete if not mistaken.  Giving you 120 total for 1 hour.  Very good.
---
How the hell do you have this? Mine are average at best? Did you change something? Or install a special version?
---
Would you mind if I take this idea and try to make a mod for fallout 4 off if ? 
---
Why didnt you use the rest of your SPECIAL points?
---
lol k
---
RDR2 has more RPG elements than F76
---
This whole time in game we were in a bad simulation and once you find the way out the game is actually well made and bug free. All of the crap that we had to deal with the whole time was due to this poorly made simulation. 
---
That's actualy a bad example no? COD invented perks...
---
Always asked myself, which company releases a „multiplayergame“, in which you have to collect around hundreds of plans, but it doesnt tell u which ones you have - I bet the same company would release a multiplayergame without the opportunity to communicate with each other without having to use a microphone;)
---
it does, but on level 1 of the perk (and i run 99% in PA). Level1 perk card procced quite often for me, but considering just a tickle of CND bonus and proc being not too often, i upgraded my card to lvl2 and it stopped proccing. Then i dropped the perk card. Not sure about level3. 
---
Because according to the road map I will reach level 50 just to get some of the perk cards so extra points will probably be used to rank he perk cards up of get other perk cards to swap in and out of.
---
Havent had any issue keeping a healthy amount on me just from basic gameplay.  Main things I bought were the dark hardwood floors, an intact door, and the animatronic santa.
---
I’ve been able to play but having all kinds of strange problems. The mods on my armor don’t seem to be functioning.
---
I just got a crash to desktop midway through a scorched earth run. Booooo...
---
Hard Bargain (Trading Perk in Charisma) definitely is worth it. Charisma at 5 and the Signs/Letters Plan that is 11,000 caps without Hard Bargain is 9600 caps with Hard Bargain 3. 230cap plans drop to under 200. There is proof in my gameplay that it is worth it. Selling is worth it also just don't remember a specific example.
---
Scrounger works IF you do the additional search (Just like Can-Do and Pharma Farma) it is not passive.
---
Can't comment on scrapper as I haven't paid enough attention to it since Beta.
---
The main quest takes you to some areas that are often populated by high level players (and thus, enemies) so it's better to actually hold off a bit until you've leveled. In particular, Top of the World, Harpers Ferry, Whitesprings and Watoga are high level areas.  There's plenty to explore in the western half of the map that will spawn level appropriate enemies. It sucks to have to stay away or get wrecked, but you'll level up pretty quickly anyway. 
---
Yet i can create my own character, house and story in FO76
---
A right of passage is to be nice to the new generation.
---
"Hmm, what would be a fun and rewarding way of obtaining plans? I've got it, hopping servers for RNG vendor plans!" - Bethesda Dev probably
---
Yeah though you could probably do without it. It's 30 DR for 3 perk points. But I want to try and get maximum DR possible for certain situations as I play a high rad low health build so I think every DR will help.
---
They did and one of them was tumbling tumbleweed, the first song I heard during the stress test. I wish they'd give a statement why it was removed since it was one of my favorites 
---
Hey I have this problem too. I don’t have anything too fancy or explosive, no mutations. I thought I was losing my mind last night, taking 5x’s amount of shots to kill stuff.
---
I've been one shotting things since the end of week one (unyielding melee build) and can say this is definitely not true in any way. The game does sometimes misname the mobs, either by having legendary on a non-legendary mob, or by failing to put legendary in their name... that is all.
---
Some items can be sold; valuable scrap like silver and gold.  
---
I want this just as a quality of life improvement.  
---
wtf?
---
Shoots slower but does more damage per shot. Good for closer combat or big targets... like a shotgun :P
---
Outfits and camp items . But I also buy atoms 
---
I very much want this and even commented on another thread about a 76 app, that custom made loadouts could work in conjunction with that.
---
You could create an attack loadout, scavenging loadout, medic loadout and change it with a click of a button on the app or in game. 
---
I fully support the loadout idea!
---
A lot of people on this game are super helpful. It’s encourages people to play it. I give out power armour frames near 76 to new players just to give them a hand and help them enjoy the game.
---
Maybe you had some kind consumable buff. I don't think Bethesda has the tools to make hotfix changes without maintenance downtime.
---
Glad it's not just me then. It's all my weapons too. Semi auto, auto, melee, explosive etc. I stopped playing early yesterday. But is it possible they nerfed or "accidentally" nerfed them
---
I also like this story very much.  I think it really went into a new direction, and that ended up not being for everyone.  But for my part, I really like it.
---
having this issue too. didnt create an ini. game just resets keybinds after restart. i just died because my keybinds got reset and this game has arse default binds 
---
Oh yes plans. and mods.
---
I get kicked every 20 minutes. Totally worth the £60
---
Dude I Didn't Know is my  2nd favorite song
---
Want all perks that don't use power armour. Than work out which armour has the best ballistic energy and rad resistance then find legendary versions of them 
---
Good job I can do the exact same shit in a better game like RUST
---
I was doing the daily quest where you get pumpkins for Jack, and of course there had to be a fissure right next to the pumpkin patch. Ended up soloing my first scorchbeast right there 
---
I'm usually a stealth sniper but when I'm fighting in nuke zones and SBs I use my double explosive combat shotty.
---
i'm going to test things. because i have two accounts (my high level and my son's lowish level).We both have level3 lone wanderer. 
---
i have both marathoner and action boy equipped.
---
sure, he has Agi5 to Agi10 compared to me and i have one optimised servos leg (second is calibrated), but i can sprint MUCH-MUCH-MUCH farther than my sons. Like at least 2,5-3 times as much. I can sprint from entrance of the bunker til the military trade terminal and still have AP left, whereas his run out of juice in like 10 seconds. Maybe my speed demon does it's thing, i don't know.
---
Well hopefuly the more people who see this.. like and comment bethesda might implement it to the game!!
---
i would be happy if i could just delete some perks, just to remove it
---
outfits like the firebreather set that don't cost atoms, that are found in buildings or through certain quests
---
I didn't, that's what's annoyed me. I'm level 85, all weapons are either 45 or 50, got over 150 hours now and my damage has been fine. But after farming the golf club after it was nuked, doing some inventory management afterwards and heading off everything was fine. Just this morning it's changed
---
So go play RUST ?
---
Haven't spend any yet (lv178). Waiting for some better looking skin for X-01.
---
I also noticed that legendary loot can appear after delay, but I think if you instantly loot the corpse it might prevent legendary items to appear.
---
The whole system is a joke, why I need to equip perks to be able to craft is just pathetic. Some "perks" need to be reworked as permanent buffs that you can only acquire after reaching a certain player and special level. But like that will ever happen because the current system "just works".
---
Are you talking about Charleston Capitol building? There's more behind that. Actually one of the cooler stories you can learn about in game about what happened to the people who survived the war and were living in Charleston
---
I agree i have multiple versions of cards i never use. Would be good to trade them for something or just delete them
---
It's so weird to think that a AAA company/publisher which is in good standing and seem to have enough funds, release a game which now plays like a half finished Fallout 4 mod on a new map.  But it would explain many things. 
---
I'm sure the originally intended to make factions alive so you could join them. But now it feels like they were told 8 months ahead that they have to release it in 2018 by the publisher. They knew they never could implement working factions now, thus kiling everyone off was pretty much the only decision they could go for now.
---
Ain't that the truth
---
Pharma Farma Rank 3 - I usually have 100 stimpacks, 70-80 Radaway, Boiled Water to supply Vault 13 and I won't even try to remember how many chems I've sold ( I don't use them ). 
---
And it could be an oversight or not, Disease cure and Antibiotics are also not covered I believe.
---
Well then...
---
Tse guns aren't as good as everyone makes them out to be.  They can easily kill you. It can't be the only weapon you use. 
---
Here is my first attempt on what you are going for 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3248f9&amp;d=s40ss2sg2sm0se2sn0pe2ek1sf2c72i44ir2aa2a42am2au2a11a00la2lc2lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
Oh trust me I will.
---
It's not a soulless cash grab like F76
---
Yeah I feel like that's what happened
---
Yesterday, after reading your post, I tried testing it on legendary glowing ghouls at the whitespring. But then they NEVER REGAINED HEALTH when low. Coincidentally, none of them dropped any legendary gear either. Not even a drill fml
---
Server - singular. Just wrapped up a session tonight, had the same thing but just joined a new world. Pretty sure they rotate servers for "maintenance" so some are up while others are down. You should still be able to play.
---
As long as the perk loadouts was only usable outside of combat i'm all for this.
---
I absolutely love the sandbox nature of game TBH I never played any fallout game for "story" that was always a foot note for me my hundreds of hours are spent exploring and uncovering interesting lore that's not done in the story honestly I always find the lore I find would make better stories then the actual story. Lol. 
---
Oh nice, I'll check it out!
---
The only time you can kinda be sure they are legit is during or right after a blast zone when you're picking up legendaries fairly quickly. I'll have a rummage through it, take one and replace one. I do dump a lot of plans though, there's nothing else you can do with them anyway. Buying legendaries from vendors though, you can never be sure if they're legit or duped, picked up a nice handmade (not TSE) off a vendor, looked a bit dodge.
---
There is a PC mod that does this.
---
I’m level 62 and I’m about only halfway into the main quests. Enjoying the story so far. Favorite side story though so far concerns the missing kid up in grafton. 
---
Or we're playing a buggy online fallout release...
---
 Almost a month ago during the weight glitch era, I talked to guy who claimed to have "millions of pounds in his stash/person" I would have thought we would have a more reasonable hard cap. This one guy theoretically holds more than everyone in 40 servers combined should be able to carry.  That was a long time ago, and i know he's not banned, but it hurts knowing how gross of an advantage some people have.
---
Think they mean in game, not in the atom shop.
---
I really don't find running around in a clump of players all trying to get a tag to be compelling game play in the first place. 
---
If they made it eny other way you would see selling powerlevel xxx/hour
---
My guns are doing just fine, so anecdotally it's not some kinda "stealth nerf".
---
Please get back to me with screenshots if any here is a link to one guy breaking down some of what these perk cards dont say.

---
Thanks for taking the time to reply to people, even if you don't implement suggestions it's nice to know we're at least heard and we're not shouting into the void.
---
Irrelevant to the plot conversation.
---
The online release is buggy and needs substantial fixes, quality of life improvements, and better support, but that’s a different discussion, not related to whether the plot is that we are in fact in a simulation. 
---
The thing I've noticed isn't that they drop legendaries, it's that they've dropped 1 * legendaries or worse. Nothing at all. Idk it could be different for everyone. If you want I'll upload more videos of it as well. Also if you go to the original post it covers the subject of some enemies not having proper names, also have to point out for the sake of argument that prior to the last actual update legendary enemies wouldn't drop proper loot. Idk. 
---
They didn't just nerf xp, they also changed how mobs spawn now 
---
Correct.  I think you are not supposed to build in the water at all.
---
Glow in the dark map :) and a door! Im only just level 30 but currently have 1400 atoms just sat there waiting for something worth getting!
---
Ive gotten a pa ultracite armor plan from a regular scorch beast and a prime plan from a regular one so it not all just the queen Kill the Little ones to 
---
I didn't think it would be. It's just annoying. Especially since I was going for the platinum and was already 87% done with that. I'll just keep checking and see if it changes. If not, I'm done with the game for a while. At least until it changes
---
I called it just after 50, the game has little to offer. If I want Fallout I can play any of the other far superior games, if I want a looter shooter than I have a plethora of games that completely shit on this, if I want to play an mmorpg, well yet again I have plenty other games to choose from.
---
As it is, it doesn't compete on any level, I seriously hope that after a year or so they have brought this game up to more of its potential. As it is, I don't see it being worth any more of my time.
---
1 Hardened Mass. 1 Glowing Mass, 1 High Radiation Fluid, 10 of the Unstable Flux
---
thats why i turn on pacifist mode.
---
My GT is **III Kenshin III**. I am usually able to play anytime from 5pm to 3am EST. I just hit level 95 and I'm looking for anyone who needs help since I am running out of things to do on my own.
---
It's like 5 examples out of so many tapes and notes that I think it's way too much of a stretch to even consider in comparison to the straight up literal way it's told. Just my opinion.
---
The Christmas Flood
---
Add me bro I got guys waiting to run a queen: psn is Grazkhul 
---
I am pretty sure the welcome mats have a description that goes something like "sets spawn/travel point" But afaik it does not work properly. One time I changed the mat to a newly unlocked one. After that, I and my friends spawned in front of the door. Although this might have been a coincidence since I deleted the entire back row on the foundation on my base before. This might have changed the spawn as well. But like campio\_s\_a already mentioned moving c.a.m.p. device within building area will change your spawn location.
---
True but im on ps4 and mods are unsupported by bethesda and are banning people for them!!
---
You will still lvl up but i dont think you can "bank" perks. Say you are lvl 5 and want a lvl 10 perk. Correct me if i am wrong on this. But you cannot wait those 5 lvls and then at lvl 10 immediately put 3-5 points into a single perk. If you wait until lvl 10 to choose perks you will need to choose first among theperks that was aviable at lvl 6, then aviable at lvl 7 and so on. There is no benefit to waiting.
---
I'd report that, sounds serious.
---
eating and drinking that much really isn't normal. My character doesn't need to eat or drink nearly that much at all, maybe 2 water and two food an hour. 
---
Some game makers actually buy in-game assets from external sources.  Perhaps these were bought from same company?
---
Nice one! 
---
Ok guess I will have to run sum test and see what happens
---
Somebody doesn’t know how EMPs work. 🤭
---
Untrue.  They are banning people for using cheat hacks and duping.
---
Customer support even will back you for using mods.
---
Show a single proof of evidence of such a case.  Proof, not claims.
---
Have you checked out /wooosh ?
---
I do feel like there's a dearth of mobs and they always seem to pop up many levels below me. I'm at level 35 and still level 1 Scorched appear when I'm the only one around. Etc.
---
I also find that I can, without much drama, take on mobs 20+ levels higher than me, even duplicates, without reallllly getting close to dying. This is with a fairly mundane set up, no real legendaries, etc. Just a sniper rifle and a .44 and some um-modded T51b.
---
I just kinda find myself wishing I ran into more things out there. I do get that it's supposed to be post-apocalypse and there just aren't that many things there, but it does feel a bit empty.
---
PS. Bethesda, put more things in rivers! They are just crystal clear trenches of nothingness but a single fish if you stomp around them. :)
---
What a LOT of people don't understand, but is downright chilling to realize, is that in the plot, you're only a few hours/days away from what's happening in the story. Parts near the end of the story happened extremely recently, as if to say "if only you'd gotten here minutes sooner". 
---
Continuity of just a little bit would allow things like the powering up events,  etc. or goals like getting the titans running to matter.
---
I'm mostly buying photomode poses, because I really like wandering around and taking snapshots.
---
It’s possible. -15% damage while standing is a tertiary effect.
---
Thanks. I'm kinda focusing on PvP. But your edit gave me some ideas. I've changed it up a bit.

I’ve killed 57 scorch beasts to date not one has dropped plans or legendary weapons I’m unlucky I guess . I’ve been on 5 queen kills seen and helped kill  on 3 and received ultracite armor build plans never mods . “I feel like Charlie Brown “All I got was a rock”
---
Yeah don't get me started on chemist making double chems and with super duper you could theoreticall make something like 32 diluted stims from 2 ticks blood
---
You think 1k caps is expensive?
---
Yep....me too! Aim at the legs and they become legless and just lie there waiting to be hit.
---
The photomode was one of those features that initially I thought was stupid and pointless and now I'm addicted to it. I'd like them to do more with it though - incorporate it into the game in a more competitive fashion, make it possible for me to see other player's photos. Maybe make it so you can frame/display your own photos in your camp or something.
---
While it's super true that they can super easily kill you, having marsupial means you can jump to aim at stuff that gets close to you if it happens. Just means you need something for indoors, I just use a Two shot Gatling instead of my TSE Gatling.
---
Almost 100 hours in and only level 30...so Yup!
---
Because if i personally go through the hassle off setting a nuke off, i'm going to use whatever weapon i want and not worry to much about the random low levels trying to tag enemies before i one shot all of them. 
---
Just the way the OP states death from above came up....it came up because that guy / team ran the bunker and dropped there nuke where they wanted and will use whatever weapons to kill the adds they want to. If OP wants time to run around and tag all enemies just for loot then they should get off there ass and drop there own nuke no?
---
Have a friend who got plan: Calibrated shocks for Utracite, luckiest guy I know. Gave him the mats and the legs and made them for me. Love running around in my Utracite armor tho I wish I could get the helmet modded with Targeting HUD and the torso with something, Motion Assist or emergency protocols.
---
Cool glad I could help can't wait to see the final build 
---
Wendigo cave spawns one 
---
Yep. Nukes were fixed already and they had fixed one duplication glitch so fingers crossed they fix the new one. (came out like 4 hours after yesterday's patch) 
---
I'm not going to lie and say the game looks this good all the time, it doesn't. But sometimes it does and when I see that I screenshot it. 
---
Best way to get good screenshots in Fo76's photomode is find a place with good lighting and get in close with the FoV. I've taken 100's of quality pics in this game, it's very nice if you look hard enough.
---
IIRC you can check on the challenges menu.
---
And regular scorch beasts it's really hard to come by but they do drop. 
---
Agree 100% with the OP. And give us the possibility to change the character name ( we can change gender... so why not the name to make a whole new character with the ash of an old one )
---
lol "Everyone who has a TSE weapon is a duper"
---
So..as a sniper, I can't go for the kill...I am forced to run around and kite them.   fantastic.
---
How much RAM does your system have? I was having the exact same issues with 8GB RAM, upgraded to 16GB and it completely fixed the issue for me. The games uses upwards of 11GB RAM, possibly a memory leak issue idk :/
---
Mothman doesn't scare me normally. However last week I was trying to vats target a scorchbeast wing from a distance. When going into vats it locked on to a vengeful Mothman fairly closeby just sitting in the fields (outside of Watoga) just staring at me.
---
Also once targeted an idle wendigo hanging in a tree once before. It was out of her range so she did not attack me yet. Is this a default hiding spot for them?
---
I can totally see those high lvl guys going "Awwww.... look at this cute little lvl 36 guy! Isn't he like the most adorable dude ever? Did you get lost in the nuke zone, buddy? Here, have some stuff!" :D
---
Sure. msg sent
---
Downright chilling? It's bizarre and makes only very little sense if you strictly follow the main quest without any deviation. Even on a strict path the timeline is fucked up.
---
How sad, I really feel for them, I too need ballictic fibre quite badly :-)
---
This. I do this all the time especially since I do a ton of trading in game. Reddit and Xbox chat on my phone have changed the way I game.
---
Typing on my console without a keyboard is terrible.
---
Mutations can actually increase damage as well, drastically.   I have been trying to get Marsupial and now have 14 other mutations.  I would rather not have "Twisted Muscles" since I prefer to use guns though.   So I might start removing them until that one is gone and try and build them up again.
---
Keep in mind Rad-X will disable mutations, diluted Rad-X does not.  
---
Hint: You can use Diluted Rad-X multiple times and it weighs half what Rad-X does; there is literally no reason \*not\* to use this other than clicking a button twice instead of once.
---
It's why I'm not using my atoms on the vault tech paint. I know as soon as I do a new limited one will pop up. 
---
Mods can be found at vendor in watoga (Brotherhood of Steel vendor) though the ones you're looking for are very rare to find.
---
Plans can be found via the treasure maps (not sure but except forest treasure maps, they all should give you a chance to drop those plans ) , also very rare.
---
Lucky!!!! Yeah I don’t have crap for mine!! And can’t find anything other than rusty knuckles  and motion assist for the excavator PA.
---
Oh, I'd love to have photo frames in camps (and a way to store items in shelves, like that [beer mug](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/419898694163365900/530438519529930797/ScreenShot56.png), [teapot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/419898694163365900/530440368911679510/ScreenShot58.png), [lighthouse souvenier](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/419898694163365900/530447585501118475/ScreenShot63.png) or teddy bears).
---
Played a bit of Fallout 4 again lately and really missed photomode. Maybe I should look if there's some posing mod out there ... Know Skyrim had a semi NSFW one at least.

Camp items. Race car bed is a must.. just because...

Sitting on 4080 atoms, only thing I want is good paintjobs for my PA (ie Black)

Trying to make people play the way you want? So I have to put away any weaponry that quickly kills things, just so someone else can leech off my effort? If they're really so concerned, they can use molotovs. Inexpensive to make and easy to find. Lay down a few each wave and it's guaranteed EXP. That's what I do during nuke hordes before swapping back to good weaponry. Don't force your bullshit on other people because they won't let you leech their shit.
---
Or you did all of them at the same time!? 
---
Same here. Close to 100 hours and level 30 myself.
---
Yes they god damned should. I've been saying since beta that we should be able to craft a sonic grenade that forces them to land. Those things were impossible before I got a TSE. 
---
I saw a post where someone said they got banned for mods, and the comments were saying "well they did say no mods soooo"
---
Do you have speed demon mutation?
---
I wish cars in real life had that
---
Everyone will get blue screened if you place a Base like that 
---
It makes plenty of sense. You're honestly overthinking it if its not making sense to you.
---
I can't disagree that one of the best ways to show something needs to be fixed is to show how broken it is.  I don't know you so continuing to question your motives is a complete waste of everyone's time.
---
I got herbivore and just run a small garden.  Its highly beneficial.  Just not as convenient as Carnivore would be is all... Specially with that dead body feeding thing.
---
But I just make about 4-5 soups and 10-15 blackberry juices before heading out.  All is good.

Indoor plants: Plant crops on bonfires inside your camp
---
Floating lights: place lights on a tree then power it up, then remove the tree and you won't ever need replace your street lights again.
---
Floating turret: not sure if they patch it since I haven't tried to reproduce it. Same as the floating lights but get a block of the wooden lights to be the base of your tower, once you are able to place it on top of em, remove the tree and the lights (needs one minimum) and you can have your high ground floating missile tower with a stupid long as range (if you have pets around, the turret will shoot any enemies they agro at, as long your turret has a clean LoS , not sure if has any range but Ive seen my missile tower do some crazy snipes)
---
Environment is your friend, make use of it. I've seen couple buildings, workshops and power stations with power boxes which give 10 power if you attach a wire to it, makes 0 noise and cannot be destroyed. There are cool places like the power station north of watoga which holds a power box and ALSO a lead deposit, you can build inside the power station and make use of the map indestructible fences to protect your base, use the power box to get free energy and have a cool well protected base 
---
Low on stimpaks? Super duper is your friend! And the other stuff that doubles your crafted chems. Everytime you get a stimpak just craft it into a diluted one, why? I know diluted just heals half of a regular stimpak, BUT you get 2 normally , if you use the chem perk (can't remember name) it's 4 stimpaks and super duper could get you 8! That's squeezing 4 stimpaks out of one. 
---
Want a power armor but you are poor and don't want to craft it? Firebases near watoga are fairly close to each other they have high level power armor and you can server hop to get a full set within 20 mins, you can use that when you can't afford repairs on your XO 
---
Low on fusion cores? U running on your last one? Just exit the game before it runs out, it gets back to 100% durability. If you have several of them just store them on a separate chassis, as long you ALWAYS keep the chassis on your inventory and NEVER ride it, you can have a solid fusion core stash. 
---
Tired of summoning your 10 power suits to check which one is your XO? Get any atom paint for it ( it will display the atom icon next to it) making it easier to identify 
---
I found the plan at Becker Farm in a safe. I was around lvl 120 ish. Just got lucky with randomly checking for loot.
---
Yeah surely, surely, surely the ability to store things on shelves has to be on their to-do list. Otherwise what's the point of even building the shelves?
---
No, and this is why I am avoiding it, cant imagine it then...
---
Guess I found a use for my 200 gold and fiberglass. Thank you.

Im always bulking my junk, saves space.. I cant even imagine not doing this.

The simulation pods within fallout 3 also had the capability to sustain individuals for over 200 years (Tranquility Lane). Even if you were to argue that the ghoul kid in the fridge is non-canonical and that ghouls require sustenance, we can safely assume that the pods have the capacity to keep a ghoulified human alive for that long (considering what made those humans weak and unable to leave the pods were because they aged and couldn't live without the incredible life support systems).
---
Although, knowing beth, we won't have playable ghouls ever without mods. 
---
Excuse you, I made my character look absolutely *fabulous* in the Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit
---
Stuff like the jukebox play other songs. Maybe they included those kinds of things as well when mentioning the number of songs on "the radio"
---
Correct your people! I left a ton more ammo last night and a dozen plans I already know. 
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-will-have-mod-support-but-not-at-launch/
---
Again, some can say they were just "modding" when in reality, they were caught duping and cheating.
---
Can't find anything 
---
I was a bit taken back with the whole petrified corpses and what they were. Also some of the holotapes especially young colonel are downright depressing.
---
I guess so, 4 hours ahead of us and sometimes using her psychic powers to congratulate us on things she shouldn't know about. But ya, makes sense.
---
Man I never see legendary enemies at Harpers. The game and RNG likes you better :)
---
 turns out I do have the letters, but thanks for the offer. Now I just need to find that pesky traveling door salesman. 
---
Lvl 50 has something like 1/200 drop rate
---
Lvl 65 has around 1/100 drop rate
---
Lvl 80 1/10
---
Lvl 95 2/1 (yes 2 plans per kill)
---
That's the drop rate for plans (I hunt scorchbeasts a LOT) the type of plans is just RNG can be either plain armor plans, mods or prime receivers. Just cross your fingers n keep trying
---
Try harder
---
Here is another example of Todd Howard backing mods.
---
"We love mods, and so we are 100 percent committed to doing that in 76 as well," Howard said. "We will not be able to do that at launch though. Our goal for launch—this is really new for us—is have a well-running, robust service, and then some period later, we're currently still designing what that service looks like, you'll be able to have your own private world and be able to mod it and do all of that.
---
Anyone that claims otherwise without providing 100% proof is probably cheaters.
---
I think this is accurate, banking perk points only really happens past level 50 I recently hit lvl 102 and from 100-102 I didn't realize I had leveled up so I had the nice experience of maxing a perk card when I did finally check. 
---
You could say you were killed by Atom Ant. RIP.
---
There is also an eyebot vet with a bunch of kittens following her.
---
Yeah, I played Assassin's Creed Syndicate, too
---
Maybe check their durability? You said you checked before and after a whitespring nuke farm, bet that's why
---
 why do legendaries explode? 
---
The no star legendaries that spawn in Watoga drop crap legendaries and their health doesn't replenish if you 50% them first. 
---
Duping and cheating? No I signed up for a game as a service, an working one.
---
The “new” duplication glitch is literally just a 1 added step variant of the last one. If they try to fix it again there will be a new dupe by noon 
---
Found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9w01kv/some_things_i_learned_about_the_perks_for_those/e9go25z/
---
I'm using a high RoF weapon which is probably why I am seeing it more.  Might not be worth it for a sniper.
---
I much rather have a one of those lever action carts you can get at a train station and ride that thing around.
---
It can be made from junk parts and look all garbage-y and fit within the fallout world.  
---
I would not want an actual working train in the game.
---
Yes they do exist, I have a T-60 set painted with the sentinel paint.
---
I'm actually really curious if an Endurance max melee build would be viable with no PA since you could wear legendary effect armor that could make you pretty tanky, it might even be PVP viable against TSE weapons with the Assassin mods, I've been gathering pieces for it but haven't given it a shot yet.
---
Same. I've played almost every day (an hour or three at a time) since the Beta, and I've only just broken Level 45. I divide my time between the main quest and exploring. There's so much to see. Even areas I know well (like the Forest) keep on surprising me when I visit them again.
---
Teaming with some good people really adds to the game for me. The only downside is sometimes you can't get into the teams server due to it being full. And in a way that's good because it means people are playing and BGS will continue to support the game.
---
I have bought some of the useful emotes (hunger, thirsty, etc.) and also got the cooking one for when I do PVP kills. Some emotes for photos are nice too. Besides that, I just save my stuff up. I want a nice pipboy skin to use so waiting on that stuff! I'm 250 hours in already and the daily and weekly challenges keep me busy.
---
I'm disappointed that I cannot close the door after sitting on the throne.
---
YOU COULD'VE SAVED THESE PEOPLE, CHARLIE! BUT NOPE, YOU JUST *HAD* TO. BE WASTING TIME FOOLING AROUND IN SOME STUPID AMUSEMENT PARK TRYING TO GET A CAT COSTUME!
---
Their opinions are trusted until i disagree with them!
---
Thanks. I feel like this has really helped develop the build. Do you have a max level build planned? And I hope this has given you some ideas too.
---
Fully repaired. It's also the weapons in my stash I've not used. No idea what it is. But I'll probably just check again later today and see it it changes. Maybe there was something up with the game. It's not the first time the game has broken
---
I’m gonna get downvoted for this...goodbye karma...
---
Why not atoms? It’s a currency that is more highly controlled than caps, can be earned or purchased, and I don’t feel like it’s really pay to win. The fact is that a good build wouldn’t need to do it. It could even provide a more interesting processor earning that respect if you don’t want to buy the atoms. Go complete some daily challenges with your current build, respec, and go again later with the new build. 
---
Plus it would give me something to spend my atoms on...as long as the price is decent.
---
Mine Ore with excavator, equip Ammosmith+Super Duper perks and build the ammo.
---
*laughs in creation engine*
---
The fusion core bug was fixed last I checked on PS4? Other than that great list of tips thanks for sharing!!!
---
It's mmo now
---
Go to the missile silo by Watoga. 
---
Also you may want to carry a black powdered rifle as you can vats hit SBs even when they're spamming due to the lack of mods on the rifle. It seems to make the SB land too but I may be tripping. Your build may vary.
---
What is it confirmed that there will be pvp servers?
---
I like the way the game will occasionally spawn in very high level enemies (I guess in response to a high level player in the area). Keeps it interesting.
---
Awe, what a sickeningly sweet story! 😁😂🤣😂🤣😂😂
---
I've found my laser gun plans from locked safes in the forrest area and from the patrol duty event (and I was well above level 50 for each find). I've never seen it sold by a vendor.
---
I only knew it was a player because he came back and started shooting up the place with me trying to cook some food. I could have ripped him a new asshole since he was a low level but I do not want to engage in PVP. I left the server and he was left with a high bounty.
---
My camp has come under attack by in game creatures but I don’t recall ever getting a warning message.
---
It’s called the quickboy, it’s a feature 😂
---
I agree, I thought it was my mike so I bought a new one. and since then I have only every heard someone coughing. I'll keep saying hello, hopefully one day someone will say hello back.    
---
Haha guess you been ignoring everything they been doing since launch and and yeah I hated new vegas at launch because of the bugs but it wasnt as bugged as this for me. It wasn't a cash grab here build this in 18 months with an engine you've never used. has an expansive story with multiple ends and can run on pc without having to do all kinds of tweaks.  76 build in 3 years bare bones story 120 quest listen to this robot tell you a bedtime story. Kill incoming horde no expansive character dialogue and story.
---
Try wearing power armour without the pa helmet, but with a space helmet. That's awesome!
---
Here’s my thought I enjoy playing now because I can pick the game up and drop it literally at any given moment if need be and I won’t feel like I’m not making progress. I did duping 1 time for ammo and stimpacks and never looked back. Now if I see some lower players who look like they need assistance I try to give them a few stimpacks so that they don’t have to waste their caps on them. I’m a shotgun build so I usually find enough shotgun ammo to use so the ammo is no longer needed 
---
I want to HAVE one of those!
---
If it was up to me, world's boned. I was making every-color-tie Mr. Fuzzy care packages for new players before it was cool. RIP West Virginia.
---
There are so many TSEs that the dupers throw them on the ground or give them away (same thing). 
---
heh I forgot the most obvious, check the train station boxes for ammo dumps.
---
To be fair, I've played the SHIT out of this game. I know where everything everywhere is, and everything that happened. The story is super vague if put together in piecemeal. 
---
Hopefully they do some work on really fixing it this time. These dupes are stupid. 
---
Don't feed the trolls. 
---
What we did is very vague. She's pretty much just assuming that we're doing what we've been told to do up to that point. Now the holo you find at the Silo is probably the only head scratching one, considering she just 180s on you.
---
She won’t land as often if at all with a base there. Might be better to go without because most damage is done when she’s on the ground.
---
Remove two shot and explosive entirely. Legendary Weapons shouldn't have damage modifiers. There are plenty of useful effects you can apply in their place that do not throw off balancing.
---
Never been able to sell plans/recipes.
---
If you see "server interrupt" or whatever, check your mal for 2 people very close to one another. You got some duppers.z
---
I think you know the answer. There are no magic methods. Just run around in a circle with everybody else and enjoy your dull, lifeless existence.
---
Oh man, it'd be grand, friend. I'm older and frequently drunk. I'm overqualified.
---
There are lot of scum youtubers who only cover F76 when there is some hate material prime example is legacykiller and jim sterling. Good ones are Oxhorn Rifle GAmind and Open World Games.

---
They aren't a problem that needs fixed as long as the insanely OP melee builds are a thing.
---
So just take everyone's weapons away? That sounds like a bad idea, although I sort of agree with you because even though I have one I wish they were never in the game at all.
---
#YOU LOAD 16 TONS
---
Max build planner? No at my current character is only level 36 at the moment. I have learned a lot today from you and others. What do you play 76 on?
---
Griefers before the war, griefers after. Motivation identical.
---
Broken armor.
---
It was for a ton of ppl at launch giving pc gamers motion sickness with low fov some ppl it wouldn't stop crashing or the lighting glitches or invisible enemies killed them which I just had happen to me yesterday but it was to weak now to do anything to me.
---
I always try to play in pacifist mode now. Especially in blast zones. 
---
Thanks for your answer, not sure why my comment was downvoted though lol
---
Stop complaining noobs, i can one shot you with commie whacker, or whatever weapon i get in hand. L2P. lul. 
---
I got the blackbird PA skin. Haven't put it on anything yet and don't know if I will. They got me with the "limited time" so I just spent the atoms I had. I also bought the clean water purifier because somebody said if you use it with the regular one it lets you get more at your camp, but I think that is inaccurate, but I still need to test it. Also I got an icon. I think that's everything. I haven't spent any real money. I said if they fix the crashes, disconnects and bugs and keep adding good stuff, and maybe use sensible pricing, I might buy some atoms if I don't have them and there's something I want. I don't do daily missions either and still have over 1000.

---
Yeah, YouTube is a shitshow these days.
---
Currently saving for the Scarlet Sniper, but have brought the Mallet, Camo Combat and Astro turf. 
---
Still haven’t redeemed my 500 from physical purchase yet. 
---
Ah I see, yeah the card may seem important but being able to aim at each limb will actually mess you up more than without it
---
How is melee OP?
---
At least in melee build you have to get in close range to deal dmg. Although i agree that melee needs to be adjusted as well.
---
Because most people hate this game. 
---
Fab was just stuck on that as well.  I am missing Grafton and Mountainside.  Gets my +1
---
There are some changes that could be made that could affect the process in a different way while not being detrimental to the other factors of the process, I.e crafting or the amount of items than can be in a stacks.
---
What the hell is so hard about just adding a weight capacity to world containers. That would *atleast* stop the duke of weapons because they’re too heavy to do in mass if there was like a 20-40lbs weight capacity 
---
Be careful though there are dickheads out there set to exclusively ruin your game and your fun. 
---
Same here, I found a map on this subreddit which showed the rough levels for each region (Can't find it now), I'm Level 36 and just finished top of the world. but still have loads of that region to explore, I'm avoiding whitesprings as the last me I went there I died about 5 times from radiation poisoning. 
---
I've managed to get two handmade rifles, one I scrapped and got the drum magazine, so I'm hunting round for more. I'm having a great time taking things slowly.      
---
This sounds like something a vendor bot would say. You're not wrong tho haha.
---
I'm not saying erase the weapons from existence, even though the overwhelming majority out there are duped in the first place, I'm saying replace the perks completely with something that actually belongs in a multiplayer game.
---
Yesterday I went to the National Radio Astronomy Research Center (Savage Divide) and picked up about 6 typewriters, ten fans, 4 cameras and military grade duct-tape and bags. It's only defended by medium-level scorched. A great looting location. The basement has a chemistry workshop to break it all down. There's also a generator with a fusion core.
---
You can still make a build with all the cards on the site. It helps to plan how you spend your points. I'm on PS4.
---
They had them in alot of games previously ie. Morrowind and fo3 I think. 
---
Any criticism is constructive criticism , good to hear , but can I ask why specifically ?
---
I’ve only leveled up sorta fast because I love being in the blast zone. I’m like 49 now and I played since the beta. I just like teaming up with the higher levels and trying to take down some high level mobs. I placed my camp at whitesprings before it became loot town (automated guards and beautiful grass is what drew me to it) and now I love when some drops a nuke there. 
---
Might get some use of my first meme

What about deleting game and make another for pussyes, is it good for you? There will be some meta everytime. Do you even know you can stack booblehead and psycho to get even moooooooooooooooooore damage? L2P nabs!!! :D :D :D :D
---
I'm only level 57. Everything I have, I've grinded for. The best drops I've found so far are a Vampire's Grognak Axe and a Medic's The Dragon. I don't know what the best answer is to deal with dupers, but I will tell you this, if they wipe inventories or levels, I'm done with this game. 
---
Cool would you like my gamer tag so we can farm together sometime?
---
I have three wood foundations placed where two gives the "would not be accessible" and on gives an "unspecified" error. There used to be an upper floor but I have moved/scrapped the upper floor, so there's nothing but air above and the foundation pieces are only connected to other foundation pieces.
---
I'm hoping a coming patch will fix this, but currently I'm stuck with what I have.
---
I've only purchased (not with real currency) the big vault chairs. I like the design of some of the ones that just come with plans, but they all look so tiny, like something that should be in a second grade classroom.
---
There are so many destroyed train tracks and trains everywhere in all states of disrepair.  A nice shiny train sitting on the tracks would break the immersion intensely. 
---
You are going to be a monster if you can get a bloodied or furious one. That weapon type seems alot better than before. You should also get a me handy buzz blade for if they want to run from you. Definetly fits the astetic
---
Meanwhile fallout slides the color wheel on PA skins and asks for 1800 atoms 😂😭
---
I'm lvl 180 and dont get 2 plans per scorchedbeast, I do however get like 3 or 4 for each queen i kill.
---
Sorry mate but, welcome to the wasteland.   While I agree with you partially don’t fuckin tell me how to enjoy a game I paid for. 
---
Why are you getting voted by these nerds, that's exactly what I thought when I read this. 
---
Lmao I named my character after my account anyways so it didn't really matter to me but yeah I feel you, they should add a setting or something. They should also make it so when you're in pacifist mode other players can't kill you. All it does it reduces player damage to zero. Other players can still merc' you.
---
If you learned it by scrapping, check other armor slots (torso/arms/legs).
---
I thought my game was bugged but it turns out you can apparently learn mods for other equip slots while scrapping. No idea if this is intentional or not. I have learned torso mods by scrapping arms. Couldn't figure out why the arm mods weren't showing up but then there they were under torso.
---
I hadn't touched the story, just explored and killed things with a few nukes sprinkled in... i was level 40 starting the top of the world quests. I am now level 60 and have just finished the BOS quest. 
---
In addition to the first overseer's chest, the second one in Flatwoods, as well as the desk next to it in Flatwoods seem to be popular choices, and also seem to retain the items put in them indefinitely.
---
When you fast travel, you simply pay the moth man some caps, no mystery.  Also, You don't really die, you are just doing drugs with Mama Murphy back at Sanctuary trying to ignore Preston
---
Capturing people's bases would be the shit.
---
Absolutely. Two thumbs up.
---
yea ive been waiting too to be honest, going to try to get it done after the next patch. Good luck!
---
Hard to tell when you don't give the build.
---
Every rushed game needs an Indoctrination Theory, now. 
---
It still breaks way too quickly to be useful.
---
makes sense actually 
---
"I want to see everything!"...."I can't see anything!".
---
Played this once as a lvl 12. Got a lvl 74 (highest on server) with a TSE as my hunter.
---
That was fun. &lt;_&lt;
---
You didn't post anything for people to critique.
---
You a freaky granny!!! We should Nuka and Chill...
---
I can't find as many of these types of scenes as I would like. Saw the scorched take on the Grafton Monster in Charleston, which was fun. Got in a couple of shots, and took the monster's loot.
---
Hi. I having same issue with ps4 pro.
---
Disconnects/crash with stash/queen and Whitespring. Makes taking workshops pointless.
---
I think the ps4 is struggling as well, when a lot is going on, fans go turbo, stutters like mad.
---
Keep meaning to turn boost and super sampling off to see if that helps.
---
It ruined it for you? That’s the only way I use it. 
---
I put level 3 locks on them because lower level people cannot pick them; they may not be aware that picking them will trigger wanted state.
---
But I rarely put a lock unless I am really low on a resource, then I will and remove it later once the emergency is passed.  I'm not needing it, might as well allow others to grab.
---
Most people aren't ready to be unplugged. Look around you Neo, were you listening to me or looking at the woman in the red dress.
---
Have a friend drop a nuke on white springs shoot everything once and watch the levels go up I went from 14-30+ in about 2 hours doing this
---
I clicked share on reddit on the nuke dragon website and it redirected me here with the post thread option so I thought it was embedded upon creation. I linked it now. Sorry
---
Now don't go and /wooosh me, but am I missing something here? Where is your build dude?
---
I hope so
---
What
---
Do what I do...Flag them all as spam and get back in to Appalachia!
---
So i guess you find 1-shotting everything gameplay fun ? What about PvP ? There can't be any real PvP like this.
---
It's weird, because I have speed demon, and the eating/drinking part is just trivial, even with no perks to modify it.. Do you have constant dysentry or other diseases??
---
What does your S.P.E.C.I.A.L look like with all the mutations? Any negative effects that are problematic?
---
Until you run into a 3 star legendary elite mirelurk queen that spits acid. She 1 shots everyone with her poison acid.  Seriously. Even in full power armor. Lvl 100+s dying in droves lol
---
It's still a broken weapon modifier. Though honestly if you want "massive damage" you need to do a sneak build and silence your weapon.
---
If you want to melee .. I suppose thats fine but why? You have a tse. Get marsupial, jump and point the gun down. On top of that if you silence the weapon, get sneak and escape artist. Wear armor that is shadowed with harder to see in stealth modifier and boom. 
---
Whats funny is my Guerrilla character .. with no legendary weapons. Can sneak kill a scorch beast without being seen. With a auto pipe pistol.
---
Again there is NO NEED for a build with a two shot explosive weapon minus 5 in int.
---
So when a player puts a item in a transferrable container in the game world,  it stays there for other players to loot? If so, how long does it stay there?
---
oh yes yes yes yes yes
---
That one legit fucked me up. It’s the worst one, I think. 
---
We all are, unless we aren't...
---
This is definetly possible, I have a bloodied Mr handy blade that does 25 damage at full health so I wouldn't doubt the chainsaw is insane. That's without other perks or mutations. 
---
Whats the third effect?

Calling people stupid is a valid criticism?

Whitesprings security vs enemies is also really funny. They almost always win with the exception of fights against behemoths.
---
Bethesda did something like this in FO4 Far Harbor. The main plot line left you with the question whether you were human or a synth. Bethesda likes to twist the plot in subtle ways.
---
Not a big gamer really, only the last 4 Fallouts and Eve Online.

Yeah a lot of people don’t like 76. Just blank it out. If you enjoy it then that’s awesome. Don’t let the overall moaning get to you.

*An enemy with legendary name sometimes drops no legendary loot

*An enemy without legendary name sometimes drops legendary loot  
---
*Armor pieces seem to take 95% of the loottable of legendary enemies

*There really should not be over lv 10 wooden pieces, over lv 20 leather pieces etc. Lv 50 wooden crap is just plain worthless, no matter the situation or build.

**WHADYU GET? ANOTHER DAY OLDER AND DEEPER IN DEBT**
---
Sure and if you need help with anything I'm happy to help.
---
Fair enough, learn something everyday I guess.
---
I am following all the news and every screw up, both in game and marketing wise is being taking care of right away(now the dupers are on the table). Obsidian had plenty of time considering they have all assets handing to them by Bethesda,. NV is basicly F3 mod, that is why many not even considering it canon. Well this and retcons and fuck ups in lore made by Obsidian :D Maybe you don't remember clearly launch of NV but it is most bugged Fallout game in series. Yep, F76 runs better at launch than NV and this is complex multiplayer game with thousands of obcjets and largest map ever in franchise.
---
I've killed a ton of Behemoths and they can drop decent stuff. Lots of junk and sometimes decent weapons and armor.
---
Sure man.
---
I don’t mean a new train , i mean the area did suffer the effects of a nuclear fallout... maybe a nuclear powered one conducted by mr conductor or a conductron , maybe you have to defend the moving parts / machinery of the train during the attacks , my point is it would fit with the map.
---
The current real time VATS is nice for quickly targeting multiple enemies. it's also tracks with the target if you have to shoot them more than once to kill them.
---
So is this a thing across the board with all loot containers?
---
Who?
---
Yeah I've been heading out to the Vault entrance and dropping a little goody bag of a few Stimpacks, some purified water, excess ammo, and a low level gun or armor if I have them. 
---
I came to say something similar. 
---
That's my yesterday experience and it was terrible...
---
I had to take my Minigun just to ping stuff and then swapped to Hammer.
---
Confirmed locations are Torrance House, Fort Defiance and the Glassed Caverns found near Enola Walkers body
---
I haven't received any kind of loot either, I just use the ones that are on their knees to snap dirty photos....haha
---
Nope, level 100+ so have disease cures and antibiotics to cure Appalacia...
---
Good tip.
---
Yeah, I miss big settlements, collecting things, and even some of the companions. I'm not finished with FO76 yet, but I can foresee a time when i want to go back to FO4.
---
Thanks I think I needed to hear that. Destroying super mutants with my sniper rifle and grenades always satisfies. 
---
You want an other one? So I drop a second bomb here 
---
Tested the other day, no disease, no chem, crouched down and left it 10 or 15 mins and my food and drink bar was down to about just below 3/4...
---
No we haven’t. What’s the point? Once you have everything the game isn’t as fun.
---
There’s no better feeling in Fallout than getting a good drop.
---
Broken? I said laughable.  
---
This isn't PvP, this is you hit me by accident 9/10 times so I'm going to kill you. Under the impression this person actually wants to fight he can just stand around and attack you whenever he pleases. My motive: caps and your junk.
---
My CAMP: [https://i.imgur.com/huPkg8w.png](https://i.imgur.com/huPkg8w.png)
---
I have it set up just down the road from the Overseer's CAMP, right in front of the road sign to Flatwoods.  It's right next to a pick up truck that has a cooler in the bed where I can drop gear for Newbies to grab. Level 1 Brotherhood Recon rifle is my go-to, since it's cheap to make and comes with a recon scope, long barrel, and extend mag by default.  
---
Newbies, if you see the Roadhouse on your way to Flatwoods or Charleston, stop by and say hi. Or just grab some shit.
---
You're probably being downvoted for not being funny and not adding anything to the discussion, regurgitating shit that has already been said many times that is completely irrelevant to the post at hand. 
---
So much yes. 
---
There's no valid argument, the original patent clearly shows which way is correct. Some people just want to watch the world burn🔥
---
maybe those in the vault changed their names? you know, a new society and all that, fresh start to reclaim the world? 
---
'before the bombs I was plain old Jim Smith, but now, in this new world I shall be called Swaglord420!'

You speak in the past tense, does this mean that many if not most people now have already 'beaten the game' and are moving on to pastures new, if you've already climbed the highest peak in FO76, what else is there to do really?
---
Rinse and repeat?
---
Used to have a variety garden before I decided to plant just for adhesive farming. How are the blackberries working? 
---
   
---
you can not trade it, after 1 week it disappears from your inventory, it has no weight 
---
I was not sure if there was one in my camp during beta until now. It always bothered me when turning of the jukebox haha. Why is it gone though?
---
Ah, you're going all out on shotguns. Nice build dude. Only tip I've got is if you're planning on using an explosive shotgun I'd recommend you put a few points in demolition expert. Cheers
---
Explosive venting intensifies.
---
I know right!  I keep getting these "youtube" suggestions about fallout 76 and its all opinion, non-factual, hate-mongering, click baits.
---
I used to enjoy watching some Youtube gamers, now I actively despise them all.  I stopped watching youtube all together.
---
Loool yours is the same as mine!
---
Fallout 76 is not an RPG. Not unless you consider games with personal stats but zero player choice to be RPGs.
---
And just because something is traditionally an RPG franchise doesnt mean non-RPG spinoffs, like this one, should not exist. 
---
But yes I agree with your premise that character names should be seen. 
---
Has anyone disconnected so hard their console shut off? Cause that happened to me once. Shit was weird. 
---
I think the original game manual for the first game implies that the entire game is a simulation/tutorial. It explains that you need to put on their vr headset and then shows you the cave where you exit the vault for the first time in fallout 1.
---
I like to think everything up until Anchorage dlc is cannon. We never left the VSS simulation after fallout 3.
---
I think you have to press twice on the jukebox to turn it off. Turning off the jukebox songs is the first thing I do when arriving at my camp. Upside the lights stay on.
---
I concur. It’ll be painful, but also fun to start again. I’m struggling for things to do now and if I start another character I know I’ll just boost him with a load of stuff from my other one. 
---
A wipe would force me to have to hunt everything down again, only this time I’ll know what I’m doing.
---
Meh ... survival light.
---
😂🤣😂
---
I guess, but there is no machinery that works except for those deep underground.   Perhaps a subway or something that did not get impacted.
---
But would rather see the trashy lever action single train car thingies.  That would be awesome.
---
Nawh, i now use 4\* machete. But when i have some problems, i pull out that TSE pump, bcos my char is 300hours old, why the fuck i would want strugle on group of basic mobs? There is no chance someone could kill SBQ in one shot, fastest i seeen was 1minute and that was some crazy damage. So, yeah i have fun, all those fkin hours.
---
Yeah it’s a great strat, helps my melee teammates a lot. Keeping up with the crystal to make the ammo is much harder though
---
I think there are 2 types players and maybe a 3rd.
---
1.) The player who bought this due to fallout 4. Lack of npcs and the way the story is told is no bueno to a LARGE majority. It's the biggest reason you see everywhere "the game has no stories or human npcs, it's lonely, other real players do not substitute for fleshed out human NPC's.
---
2.) The person that is fine with the game, it's story and how it is told to them. They generally play alone and are not hard to please as most of the time they are focused on their build or weapons and the story truly takes a back seat, I NEVER hear people in game talking about how amazing the story was ... more so about how broken or shitty the quest are.
---
3.) Then there is the person that loves the story, the game and everything to do with it. Involving the lack of npcs. Though do I see a lot of people trying to talk themselves into thinking they like no human npcs. Which we all know just is not true. Take out the NPCs in the next FF installment or tales and only allow it to be played like this. It.Would.Suck.
---
I personally am in the camp that the story is meh, mediocre at best. The overseers quest is kinda boring and mundane and the best quest to me have npcs I can interact with .. well ... press E for. The lack of dialogue options makes choice non existent other than not doing the quest. I get we've arrived from the vault a few mere hours before EVERY FUCKING ONE DIED, but that's weak and lazy story writing and shows they could have easily populated the world with factions and npcs for us. Notes are tedious as are holotapes and when in a group near impossible sense everyone has their own sense of pacing. Not to mention that feeling of boredom that sets in after you found your 50th dead guy you were too late to save or even speak too. "Oh I bet theres a note" exciting.
---
The way almost all the recorded holotapes come from the perspective that THEY WILL BE DEAD. No real foreshadowing no small cinematic for us to see what happened, just everyone is dead and you're left doing all the things they would have done ... but they can't. There is no thrill to the quest .. you know how they will ALL end. The person will be dead.
---
Idk I am ranting now. Just my 2cents, downvote if you want or w/e.
---
Well, what are you waiting for, then?  
---
There's nothing I like better than making some other bastard die for his country.
---
How is it not normal? How many times do you eat or drink in a 24 hour day? Compress that 24 hour day into a 40 min game day and I'd say it lines up pretty well. 
---
I know both of my characters are disappointed. No one knows they're really Chaz Nardgoblin and Faust Hardween. 
---
I figured something like that happened, so all the nice looking beds cost atoms.
---
Where is this? I've only saw one behemoth near twin lakes, but I was level 20 at the time. Now at level 120+, I kinda wanna score killing a behemoth off my list.
---
I dont think you can see explo resists. Just Physical / Energy / Rad. 
---
user name checks out
---
Those tools are easy to code, all they have to do is some database calls: Is a character massively overencumbered? If yes, show weight by category and sort items by summed weight: which items do pop up on top? You can easily have hoarded hundreds of stims or boiled/purified water by just playing the game, not so with thousands or even millions of nuka colas, or of the same weapon or armor. Have that tool show the other characters of that account in parallel, and give your support staff a few means to deal with the situation: wipe/replace/insert singular items, wipe all items of a given category, wipe ALL items, delete single character, ban or delete account.
---
Junk has to be looked at in a case to case manner, but more importantly the remaining weight glitches have to be fixed, and then make it impossible to move if you are overencumbered X times. And make those massively overweight characters SB magnets at the same time, so that whenever and whereever they spawn, they have three scorchbeasts on their backs and can't move until they drop that stuff.
---
This is accurate, somebody should probably tell nukeanddragons their leveling guide on the perk planner doesn’t account for this.
---
Great theory! Except fallout 5 won't happen until 2025 at the earliest, and fo76, even if it turns around everything in popular opinion and becomes the most adored Bethesda game of all time, won't last that long. 
---
Im lv 56 (now). Ive had 2 similar experiences at the WS recently. I gained 5 lvs and got some decent loot. Between spawns at the clubhouse; i work the outbuildings and train mobs back to the other guys. I can take out 1 or 2 myself, but they always save me from the rest. We split up the loot. Cant remember all their names, but thanks guys. Great fun.
---
I was level 46 minding my own business, saw one and was like ehh I guess I could try, I smacked it a couple of times and bam wouldn’t you know went down. Then there was two more and I just flat out fucked their shit up. Couldn’t believe how easy they’d become after 20 additional levels. 
---
Hm.. you're right. Will tweak it a bit. Thank you very much, man.
---
This theory is simply too good for bethesda writers to come up with. it is now my headcanon though lol
---
The damage the melee can output is just insane. Are you really asking how melee is OP? They require far less upkeep, while dealing far more damage that comparable weapons.
---
&gt;ultracite jepack
---
Are you sure the  ultracite jepack even exists ? i have checked everywhere and no one can confirm it, i miss that, and the stealhboy mod :/
---
If someone could drop me Handmade rifle plans, I'd build a small shrine to them.
---
Agree.  just remove Two Shot and Explosive.   
---
Saving this post for later.  My caps are all but guaranteed. 
---
I don't watch you tubers for this exact reason. They are the blight of the gaming community.
---
Sadly a lot of gamers rely on you tubers to form opinions for them.
---
I am not blind to the flaws and bugs of fo76. I am also not blind to the fact I absolutely love the game. I enjoy playing it and have alot of fun doing so. 
---
Sheeple with always be sheeple. Following the herd blindly. I for one am glad I don't rely on you tubers. Had I listened to them I would of missed out on forming my own opinion which is I thoroughly enjoy Fallout 76.
---
Anyway just my 2 cents on the whole situation. 
---
Simple solution- don’t release a broken game with numerous exploits in the first place. Don’t give Bethesda excuses.
---
In English, this is you "stash" or "stash box." When you go into modify mode (not build mode) does it not let you select it?
---
Surprised no one said anything about how Lone wanderer and Action boy don't play well together. But yes, that is a typical shotgun build. If you google you'll see several builds almost the same.
---
What about literally all of the relay towers...
---
Marine Armor is crap.  Absolutely.
---
Just make some cheap level 1 leathers until get the studded mod.
---
Then craft some heavy leathers and you will be able to make 45/77 resist pieces on arms/legs.  For the chest, I use BOS Combat Armor for 81/81.
---
None of those legendary. 
---
There doesn't need to be. Frankly with the current way PVP works, there can never be real PVP. At this moment in time, if I die 10 times in PVP I will lose more caps than I can get in a day. PvP is secondary in this game, taking a backseat to regular gameplay.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I've found Super Mutants, then Glowing / Albino frogs, and now higher level mobs beating up the CAMP.
---
It's all risk vs reward. If you want to take no damage then sit up on your hill and snipe. You get hit much more often and take much more damage when you're in an enemies face. Melee is fine. 
---
Your build looks pretty solid man.
---
When i got my  Decontamination Shower i was like you, and thinking "do i really need that" but after gathering up what i needed to use it i found out it's actually very nice to be able to take a rad shower and get that little or big rad bar gone, lol :)
---
Oh thanks ! And no, I don't understand why...
---
I was struck down twice by a level 70ish with your classic TSE Handmade, after 3 other level 10-20ish guys kept knifing my armor and shooting me repeatedly while I was running another level 4 friend through the Fertile Soil event. Apparently they were in a group, cried foul, and the friend came and shot me down. They lost prob 30-40 caps in total, I meanwhile lost the better part of 300 after dying twice, and all my scrap (some black titanium I'm sure, springs, screws. Not a ton, but still.) Could have been a similar situation? Low level bait, high level murder lol. (The high level guy was nice enough to offer to give my caps back/some scrap after he hear that his friends were the ones who instigated, I declined his surprisingly kind offer since I just wanted to wash my hands of it all.) I would say tread lightly and carry a damn big stick.
---
That’s fortnite. Go play fortnite. 
---
Some of us didn't though I literally decided to go full melee in this game after about 10 levels when i realized a pool cue was obliterating things better than the 10 useless guns in my inventory and never looked back. 
---
Why do they not work well together? Is it bugged?
---
My husband and I recently nuked the red rocket workshop. Nothing spawned. At all. There was flora but nothing else. I had been told if we tried there the workshop would get attacked frequently with legendary mobs. 
---
The workshop didn't get attacked once. :( I'm inclined to think the server I was on was glitched, as it never went above five players at a time and a few other random weird things we noticed, but I don't recommend nuking that location.
---
I’m a huge fan of this game because I love the fallout universe wholeheartedly. I started with fallout 3 in high school and was instantly addicted. It was like nothing I had ever played before and it absolutely sucked me in so I’m a fanboy through and through. It’s a buggy mess and annoying at times so I totally understand the hate for it. It’s a product of the new meta of games being released unfinished and then polished through updates. Sea of Thieves comes to mind when I’m playing 76. Both needed way more work before they were released, but I still love 76 just the same. It scratches my fallout itch. And with the promise of free DLC I’m excited to see where this goes. 
---
It does seem like they repeat alot.
---
In that case TSE is fine as well.
---
Woosh?
---
My apologies i thought mods where banned at this current time.!  Why dont bethesda just give the power of mod creation to us for all platforms lol surely this way it will be one less thing for them to think about
---
AWOL armaments, uranium fever, One violent night. These are all events that spawn at least one legendary
---
How is that even remotely related to what I said?
---
Upvoted for visibility. I think it’s pretty good!
---
It's fun getting your first code bit, good work ;)
---
OP is desperate for them worthless internet points.
---
You can be an enclave general and clear a silo solo at level 15, chop chop ...
---
ps the code pieces are worthless, unlike keycards from vertibots.
---
Judging by the downvotes and your initial post, I seriously doubt that 
---
I like leather at 50. Light AF.
---
Stash limitations and weight limitations are in place for server stability, same reason you can't fast travel while over encumbered.  They DO NOT want people carrying a ton of things on them, all the time.  You can NOT hoard in this game.  This is not single player Fallout. Learn to only take what you need and use the tag/search system and get rid of what you do not.  I recommend no more than 50/100/150 of any given material.  50 for the common 100 for the bulk, and 150 for the rare things or things you constantly use for your weapons and armor, including chems.  This way you will not constantly have too much of something taking up space and you will have reasons to loot when going through areas.
---
The cap limitations are in place to encourage player trading and economy and I do not see them changing, in that regard but I would not mind vendors having 400 caps per faction and resetting every 6 hours. (This is a big one for me and something I would love to see as the 24 hours limitation is far too strict.)
---
That is how you play this particular Fallout.  I realize it can be very hard to change this mindset, but you must do so.
---
All that being said, they've confirmed more than a handful of times that stash limitations will increase once they figure out server impact and stability.  Unfortunately with all this duping and cheating going around, it's going to be hard to gather just how much impact the 600 stash limitation is causing on the server because of these activities.
---
I’m just curious, did you play the other fallout games? I use VATS less in this game than any other game. I actually prefer not using it most of the time unless I’m meleeing. 
---
This is why we can't have nuce things, people
---
like you who are ok with missusing laws. 
---
Hey, thanks a lot, man. 
---
Prime Site.
---
Scorchbeasts have very high explosive resistance.
---
Yes, though it's more to do with diminishing returns. Pick one or the other. I personally use lone due to the extra protection you get with it. But either are good. Either long or action boy with 1 piece of ap refresh armor is just silly, lol. My commando NEVER needs to wait for AP is regens so fast.
---
It seems to work for me on PC, 4 out of 4 I've tried since with the latest patch.
---
Are you killing 3\* legendaries? Doesn't count if lower than 3\*s
---
Yeah sounds interesting but they’re already set to add pvp
---
Oh okay okay.. thank you for mentioning it, man.
---
You know, I wasn’t going to say anything, but this is the THIRD three-star legendary I kill and all I get is some scraps and a lot less ammo. I almost want to avoid them sometimes.
---
After 500 hours of FO4 there is nothing new for me there. All builds, all quests and all everything done
---
But it is’nt even close to battle royale...
---
and serums
---
Where did you find this??
---
No seriously no!  There are still many bugs and some core design desicions are deeply flawed! Just look at how many bugs, annoying stuff, terrible  balance, this most positive sub has. 
---
I’ve ran into more good than bad. Yeah there are dicks, but more often than not you’ll find a dude stoked to show off their CAMP site and be a chiller. 
---
It doesn't matter what they say. They can ban you for whatever reason they choose. This whole argument is inane. 
---
Bought Glow In The Dark map. Much smaller than I thought it would be. 6.5/10
---
I'm going to be of no help to you, I'm afraid. Never had that problem. You try to do a scan and repair through the launcher, I guess. I was going to recommend that you just scrap it, because you CAMP device can also act as a stash box, but if you can't even select it, that seems like a glitch.
---
But that shouldn't have happened and the community should not have to help you. 
---
&gt; jetpack,
---
Have checked around, don't think there is a  Ultracite JtePack or stealhboy mod yet :/
---
Add trenchlife
---
Aw, bucket!
---
Also, I get a kick out of "you keep pootin' and you can't come in."
---
There are lots of people including me, who dont look and just lear all plans, so maybe someone already have it, but didn't notice. There is not datamined database like was thottbot for world of warcraft, so we cant really tell, if it exist and where you can get it, but from what i know, every mod for ultracite drop from queen, maybe from normal scorchbeasts (got some prime reciever from them, dont know if ultracite can drop too, i do not check plans too much)
---
I’m not sure the game is stable enough for something like this yet. 
---
It's random throughout the mire and the bog. It will disappear if you leave and don't do anything with it 
---
I guess my only option is to move the CAMP and see if i can.
---
Put a “radshield” on 
---
I messed around with a garage trap.
---
Motorised door for the garage. Linked to a pressure pad outside.
---
Door opens when they stand on the pad.
---
Door shuts automatically once they go in.
---
I like that we are passively part of the story rather than the hero. 
---
Preach!
---
What about literally all of the ingame relay towers and terminals...
---
I was joking, but It is a pretty good viewing point. I just don't want it like that  because I like looking at my pip boy.
---
If the offended party replies with a thumbs up, it should clear your bounty. Or if you join teams with the offended party.
---
Of course this depends on if the bounty system actually tracks who you have offended.
---
The problem is when you are having fun it's really good. But every corner you turn you are faced with old fallout mechanics/bugs or issues that show a disconnect with what online open world games have achieved till now. You can look over a lot of them but the more you play the more rise up. You start noticing how little of it actually supports or is aimed at the open world experience it portrayed itself to be. I don't want to sum up a whole list because it ranges from quest, progression, pvp, economy to a bunch of other things. 
---
This all kind of ties in with how Bethesda is run. It is hard to point fingers since there are most likely a lot of devs and other at the company that really worked hard on the game. But there is also a business side and competition. All in all I just see copy paste of FO4 with all good ideas and intention never fully being realized due to multiple reasons. If you look up discussion and statements/confessions online outside of reddit it isn't hard to see.
---
Thank you, you fixed it :D
---
Damn I haven't seen any of these random encounter things and I'm like 100 hours in. I think I remember reading there's another one with a body or something, I'm not too sure. Anyways, thanks for the reply. Care to share which wire to not cut?
---
Attacking one turns them all hostile again.
---
No chance, the only sort of news were gonna get of Bethesda is more fluff empty articles like them "into the vault" pr peices and info on paid DLC...and for consoles that's even if they have learned anything from the Skyrim DLC's and quality assurance issues they had getting them approved for PS4.
---
Bethesda don't care or there community managers are busy browsing other sub's when they should be working. Its a disgrace and a joke. Gaming industry was estimated to have more value than music and film the other day apparently and companies like Bethesda continue to give there loyal customers the mushroom treatment :/
---
Not 1 other industry can hide behind broken products and lie to there customers  more than the gaming industry :( They care more about there micro transaction projections and working out the best ways to rinse customers for the cost of a AAA title whilst trying to slip in subscriptions as well. 
---
What happened to the days where pride in there product and customer satisfaction mattered more to them than anything else :(
---
FU bethesda
---
Ok, if you were at Prime Site, you deserved that one.
---
You intentionally make the queen harder for all involved so you can leach items/xp and add nothing to the fight.
---
If you were at other sites? &lt;shrug&gt; He may have been jerk, but you risk that going to a place way over your head just to leach xp/items.
---
Would be cool if it explodes and instantly turns the surrounding area into a nuke zone.
---
You could blueprint everything in your camp except the stash, and rebuild, but seems like that shouldn't be necessary.
---
I left because I didn't want to blow up and lose my junk lol so I have no clue. There is also a super mutant body with explosives in its chest and a few others. 
---
Maybe try to play PvP for a few hundred hours before posting about it please.
---
Huh. Jack Torrance is the main character too.
---
 I also found a One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest easter egg in the asylum, just to keep the Jack Nicholson theme going. 
---
It's annoying, a week ago  i lagged and i hit a high level whit the mine-gun. Wasn't on porpuse and he start attacking me, lvl 26 (me) vs lvl 160 and was rly unfair.
---
oh ok. I was joking about the "it ruined the game for me" part. But I guess
---
My favorite tactic is once I have been griefed and harassed (only 2 instances of being baited) is to fast travel away, log my low level character off and relog with my high lvl character equipped with a TSE.  If you note the name of your briefer you can join the same server again.  They don’t seem to notice the change in level once they “hunt” you down again things get “real”.  While this happens extremely rarely, it do feel good.  So there is something to be said for your in-screen user name to not change with your character.  All that said, PvP can be a blast when it is not a couple of dorks just deatroying other folks stuff.
---
Is it referencing a mod or is it referencing the age old question people like to Argue about...?
---
Overall resistances. In air they are soooooooooo hard, like diamonds in sky. SHINEEE BRIIIGHTT. Rihana knew it
---
Happens more often than people know, this is exactly what is going on. 
---
They regularly take down single servers like this. Not exactly sure what they do, if anything, to them, but this has been going on pretty much since the game was available. 
---
I've run into it quite a few times and notice it most during odd hours in the night, when I am most actively playing.
---
Last week a guy posted that lewisburg and surrounding area is great for both ghouls and plants. 
---
Do people not realize that song was released in 1966?  It absolutely fits the theme and era of the game, be it the later years.  They don't have to strictly use 30-50's music, just style.
---
I mean it's not like we have Nickelback on the radio, calm down.
---
Wouldn't it be nice is like my childhood.
---
They already removed Tumblin Tumbleweeds.
---
If I had to pick a song that needs to go it's Crazy in Love.  I hate that high pitched voice.  Personally, I want music from previous titles added, including the 2nd record side of Butcher Pete but it should never play before record side 1 has played.
---
Bruh get better rocket launcher and a tse 50 cal
---
I was talking moreso about the fact you thought quickboy was a glitch
---
Some of us are JetHeads. We’re hip to the...bathroom scene. 
---
The tickets booths at the stations will then have a purpose, but I would totally fig it if they scrapped trains and made the monorail useable instead
---
I would rather have the monorail work again
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
yes.. I'm aware of that and (Spoiler Alert) Allegheny Asylum is Fort defiance lol
---
Oh my bad. I was serious about thinking it was a glitch lol. 
---
i always leave stuff for low level players so they can use later on in game...
---
Probably stimpacks 
---
I restarted after lvl27 cuz my perks were sooooo messed up! Im lvl27 again and there not so bad this time. Only two unused points in Luck of all things. 
---
LMAO
---
Bethesda's servers with 60 people on them all at once.....
---
Oh my days yeah, sure yeah! Why not!, PVP at -10fps is always good no?
---
The reasonably priced ones, so none :-)
---
Just a heads up since your level of sassy, snappy quips and level of knowledge seem vastly unbalanced. VATS is super useful and downright devastating for both melee and sniping if you understand how it works and choose your perks accordingly. It’s ok for midrange, but not is a little meh compared to the other two. Gun-Fu and the Luck perks turn your melee build into a Diablo 2 Whirlwind Barbarian. A silencer on a sniper rifle with the crit cards and Grim Reapers Sprint make a devastating sniper with zero aim time and OHKs.     
---
Add this to VATS mitigating the advantage of super mobile Halo Hopping PvP try-hards. 
---
Even if you’re an FPS god, ignoring VATS is intentionally neutering your combat efficiency. There is always a time and place for different game mechanics. 
---
You are entitled to your _desire_ for people to not use TSE weapons just as much as people who _have_ TSE weapons are entitled to actually _use them. The difference is they have a right to use the items their character possesses, you do not have the right to ask them to _not_ use them and then get upset about them and call them dicks when they choose to play the game _they_ paid for in the way _they_ choose to.
---
Good drop spots are the responder at 76, Overseer caches, and suitcases at the train stations. Any time I have a duplicate plan or recipe or ammo that I don't use these are my go to's.
---
I made a character, played for a couple weeks.   Made a new character, better designed, power leveled, got bored, took a break.   Came back, playing first character and having fun.   
---
Just a small tip from a heavy jetpack user - it really helps to jump across the gaps if you use it in small taps/bursts, not pressing and holding. You can cover a ridiculous amount of space hopping like this. Also, much better on your core charge (jetpack uses a LOT of it), for those who don't have a lot of cores to burn.
---
Just dropped some stuff on it last night and no issues but it was lower level gear and ammo?
---
You're right, was definitely thinking of the gauss, tesla is a full on energy shotgun basically
---
Yea, 10$ for a little cosmetic that's probably not even as good as the non-purchasable ones. 
---
The game is getting mods sometime late this year
---
I realised this also. It would be awesome if they couldn't tp out of it
---
Stars and Stripes bandana.  Seems since they added that item to Fallout all my toons have had it.  
---
even the power armor skins arent really worth it, so i’d say none unless they tone down the prices
---
Well... they also still heal while in the air if you do too much damage. Bethesda didnt fix it completely. They left the healing glitch on the already glitched spam you with light flashes till you have a seizure enemy.
---
Ooh didn't hear that one, that sound so good if done right
---
Hahahaha song lyrics thats hilarious
---
Emphasis on "if done right"
---
Wow, that is *too* many nukes. Let alone all the weapon &amp; armor repairs as well as ammo you must have used. 
---
The first time I've ever seen anyone actually explain how to turn it on. Thank you! 
---
I’ve never brought any but I saved mine from in game challenges for the vault tech paint for PA and vault tech pjs.
---
I love them 
---
the problem with this scenario is I can do something dickish and then change to a different character and the other players in the world won't know that it's me. it gives people a mechanism to be jerks without repercussions, otherwise more people would probably have a griefing alt.
---
now I could see your character name appearing over your head, but maybe in the map mode you could click on a player and see both their character name and their username?
---
an additional struggle is, usernames are subject to content policies so you can't have blatantly offensive/racist/etc. usernames that will appear to other players. not sure if the same is true for character names, or they would have to be filtered due to being displayed to other players.
---
Haha true
---
I liked the white string lights just because I used them so much in 4.
---
For value it's the succulents. You get something like 8 to 10 decorative plants that barelu increase your camp budget for 200 atoms. 
---
Then go play new Vegas then dude. They are trying something different. And have stated so multiple times. Stagnation gets boring.
---
I got the impression it's been 2-3 years since the infection won out and normal people died?  
---
Yeah no. This game sucks too bad to warrant a complete replay. The griefing potential of TSE is huge, but again that's the way the game is designed to facilitate griefing, not the weapon.
---
Just hop servers if someone is doing something that causes you issue. Literally the easiest thing and 100% effective. All of these whiney posts miss this most obvious of solutions all of the time and propose crazy things like character wipes for a fully released game.
---
I found one of these outside the water treatment plant in the forest. I cut the wrong wire and nearly blew myself to hell.
---
Sun Kissed also removes rads without removing mutations.

Here is my previous thread with a base I'm happy with: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aaxf41/does\_anyone\_elses\_house\_have\_a\_basement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aaxf41/does_anyone_elses_house_have_a_basement/)
---
I haven't really seen people doing this before, wouldn't say it's the "usual" etiquette. Although I do agree it sounds like a decent one to adopt!
---
In my experience half the time everyone just stands around waiting for the ghouls to spawn? It's hard to have a system in place when they won't even spawn.
---
Who peed in your cheerios?
---
I'm not a huge fan of those era movies so the references that might be clear to others may elude me if you're strong enough to get there the 3rd location I know for sure is at the very deepest part of the glassed cavern shortly before the elevator to return to the surface .. I did not take proper notice of the surroundings or nearby items unfortunately 
---
Have you considered that people might not like being called a duper simply for having a good weapon?
---
Yes, I did loot my primary Shotgun myself, you're the one being the dick.
---
Bethesda :P
---
Or in the early days of launch, all those people tweaking their .ini files to the extreme, then complained about game performance and crashes.
---
I would say take Enforcer + a Bloodied Explosive Shotgun.  
---
Why?
---
You can do decent damage and with enforcer manually aiming at her wings plus the splash from all the pellets all have a chance to trigger and cripple her FAST.
---
For some reason I'm always out of wood/steel. I got the construction perk out of packs but never remember to equip and halfway through building I realized I can't finish my camp:(
---
Very well-thought-out theory. Thanks!
---
...but I'm pretty sure that it's actually a very vivid daydream I'm having as I stand in line at the Charleston DMV, waiting for my number to be called and questioning my life choices.
---
I like the glowing map. It looks nice. I have the fish lamp too but no electricity hooked up to it. Don't know if it glows or not. Honestly there's nothing in the Atom shop I want or is worth paying money for. I got the map &amp; lamp with earned Atoms and still have 2100. 
---
I would buy fluxes. They are available through gameplay so I don't know if that's P2W. I would spend 500 Atoms a month to have 5000lb stash limit. There are things I'd pay for but what is there now isn't it.
---
At least the core gameplay of SoT isn't a buggy mess.  Content is something that can be built up.(Even though it should be there from the get go.)
---
Oh, then you've never been in a real golf grinding group. You join a team, then someone logs off and back in, spawning all of the mobs in the golf house while someone runs through and back out. They spawn whenever someone logs into the area. Hope that helps
---
Like, I understand being mad about people TSE one shotting in Uranium fever, sure whatever, but literally accusing everyone who has a TSE of duping because "lol you know you didn't loot that bro" is really fucking dumb....yeah dude it's not like people actually did something that is totally possible in the game without duping...
---
Code pieces aren't useless if you want a challenge. Not every player likes to cheat and get their answers online.
---
Route 65, little south of Crevasse Dam
---
the modern fireplace looks fancy !
---
I just got one. Makes the game shockingly easy. I wish they werent there either, same for fallout4. But damned I'm not going to go back to a plebe gun after literally using the anger of the gods lol.
---
Sweet, thank you.
---
I have it (and its arguably the only legendary drop I ever got that was remotely useful, I have terrible luck with drops).
---
With the single shot (default) modification I can pretty much tag everything that spawns in white springs before I even have to reload. Tagging is the key word here, as it only does about 5% damage per shot on a level 62 ghoul.
---
I suppose quad would work wonders with automatic firing mode but my cards are non-automatic rifle based. At least the ammo cost is low when manually firing each shot.
---
i always cut the green one
---
Try re-running the line that is going through the wall.  I have had issues with lines being "disconnected" when I do the wall trick sometimes.  Usually redoing it with the "now you see me now you don't" door to run the wire through seems to fix it, just test your power to the second building before replacing the door with the wall and see if it's working.
---
It doesn't, I had a loading tip recently that said "while unarmored". I imagine they added that after someone went "oh shit the perk card text is wrong"
---
all DLC will be free.
---
The only conduit that actually goes through walls looks like the letter C with a point attachment.  
---
Otherwise only way to get power through walls is the wall/window/door gkitch
---
It has no 3rd effect 
---
Yooo that’s actually funny 
---
Good old times
---
Happens to me as well . Too many times for my liking 
---
I only bothered with defending a workshop once. There's 20, and at any given time I can manage holding at least 3, which is usually enough to rotate retake missions for quick exp and plans. 
---
I loved the look of the patriot power armor paint job and grabbed that first... which is funny because I don't do PA builds anymore :-p
---
both my characters are named the same as my account name, im creative like that
---
Twice lv100+ players came up to me and told me she has high explosive res. This was probably because my TSE laser gatling gives a hell of a show. Bless the 2 souls that gave me it because they loved my camp and how they were welcomed there haha.
---
I'm an avid mmo and gear treadmill game junkie. I have not gotten a perfect roll on a weapon yet. I merely have a good set of power armor. I will be playing for a long time to come. 
---
After gear comes the min/maxxing and speed runs. Anyone who has played a monster hunter game knows what i mean here. Slight variations to the set up until it's perfectly tuned to my playstyle allowing me to kill the strongest mobs in the shortest amount of time.
---
After that, one character is complete. Then on to the next character with a different build. I have 1 sniper that I've shelved, I'll probably pull him out again. And one pistol build toon that i want to make.
---
I do think many are starting to hit that wall, but it sounds like new content may be just around the corner. So potentially, i may never hit my "perfect" build.
---
Did i mention my wife likes this game? That alone will keep me playing, as she takes forever to get things done lol
---
An online game with mods, is doomed to be a disaster.
---
Maybe 1 in 50 servers is fine
---
No problem!  I submitted the ticket.  Thanks again for the response.
---
Duping shouldn’t be possible. Those youtubers aren’t helping but it is not their job to help a lazy developer fix their broken game. And lets face it, the issues with the game are far more interesting to people from the “outside” than the actual game itself.
---
Must be lead lined.
---
If you're on PC - I can build you one for 5k caps,  5x cobalt stable flux, 5x violet stable flux.
---
You can also try serverhopping to get the mod or plans for in in Watoga, I got 2 plans for them already (got REALLY lucky). Never seen a whole jetpack mod there though, just plans.
---
While we are asking for things, why was there no mention about having card deck loadouts that aren't swappable in combat?
---
I would love to be able to swap in my crafting deck when I get into camp.
---
That’s totally fair. SoT from the start had amazing gameplay IMO. I love the mechanics in that game. Sailing and fighting was down very well. 
---
What if it's a dream and when you wake up you find yourself in skyrim where a guy tells you "Hey you. You're finally awake"
---
Yep. That gets me. I always feel five minutes too late and it's gutting.
---
It's one thing to read stories of people long since passed and it's another to read stories of people telling them just hours or days prior.
---
I swear logging out then in works only maybe... 1/3 times?
---
Right, but does the flap go to the right or the left? Tell me so I can instantly become furious and argue that you’re wrong and it is actually right in the other direction. 
---
you have stars as your password? All I see is *******
---
Ok so you believe them when they say DLC will be free, i assume you believed them when they said that there communication would be better as well yes?
---
Hate to be the one to break this to you but Bethesda lie, just look at ESO all dlc's will be included with subscription.....erm until they need more cash so instead of calling it dlc they call it a chapter :/
---
\#gotmagicbeans
---
call people dicks, then ask for people to be kind? lol
---
I get disconnected on PS4 about an average of once per hour. 
---
Awesome Idea
---
okay, so you refuse to read. got it. have a nice day.
---
How do you know they’re dupers?
---
I mean... REDRUM backwards is MURDER...
---
Dude, most of the DPS builds are self evident, including the melee ones. I doubt most people needed to run to YT to figure it out.
---
Pipe guns are also obviously the best since they get a sneaky double bonus from two weapon types for glitchy reasons. But by tse is a machined gun so there I am.
---
There are lots of builds that effectively one shot glowing dudes. Both melee and shooty. It is def bad form to not let everyone tag tho. But people should also be running smgs or some other fast pop gun for bulk tagging.
---
Anyone who disagrees with you doesn’t have cats who think it’s hilarious to high-speed hamster-wheel the roll until it’s all over the floor. Under is the only way to foil those evil shits. 
---
Cripple the wings to ground them (there are perk cards that help with this), then melee to death. Always wear power armor to fight them (unless you've got a great build and set of legendary armor pieces), even just the frame has great damage resistances.
---
&gt;ghoulified human  
---
those humans weak and unable to leave 
---
Maybe in Power Armor only ... in a devastated world where everyone rejects you for your condition being impossible to survive without the life support and assistance of moving a machine without knowing anything of what happened during these years only with flashback of what happened before the simulation along with all those torturous memories during the simulation ... welcome to Fallout
---
Why do you just assume all explosive shotguns are duped? And why do you call them TSE? Any explosive shotgun will one shot a player, wether it be two shot or not. (which most arent tbh)    
---
I have found several explosive weapons, they are not THAT rare..
---
IDK....I saw a guy with the account name buckfutters last night....better than a boring name! lol
---
Nooo i joined group of friend, they are americans, so i cant play with them all time, belive they do atleast 3hours more. There is every time one guy who is no on cooldown run solo silo (someone using glich, like progames do in all games, dupers are no allowed to play with us tho) send nuke, we most of time kill queen on first landing, and i am using melee now, so when i am not the one who do silos, it cost me close to nothing.
---
I don't use food and drink perks at all. I find most of all the cards real perks, except pacify animal
---
You can find one directly in between the lumber co and the amusement park on the road. About halfway is a small side clearing that spawns random items(such as this nuke, crashed satellites, tents, etc)
---
Did you break even on caps? 
---
Melee is the shit throughout the game. I went shotguns, but I've relied a ton on melee because it's so damn good and efficient. Doesnt use ammo. Breaks slowly.
---
Haha yeah I want them to fix the major bugs for sure, I just hope this isnt at the bottom of the list in perpetuity.
---
It kinda sucks that I can see some of these things taking forever to get fixed, but they are so simple to correct (and it helps that the cause of bug is obvious)
---
I would love it, since my characters are usually very gimicky.
---
Deuche Bag doesn't always equate to Duper.  Though the other way is usually true.
---
Someone's stealing your kills, man. They always respawn when someone loads in. I just keep server hopping when I'm alone and I always have a club house full
---
Excavator can give up to +200 carry weight.
---
T-60 is the cheapest to repair I think, no springs needed for the legs. 
---
I understand where you are coming from with your concerns but like I have told people who know me IRL, I play it because I like it in spite of it's flaws and because I trust that they want to see it be successful (IE be profitable) enough to fix it.  I have 300 hours in it already and I am still finding fun things to do, new easter eggs to enjoy, people to play with, and new builds to try out.  There are a few things that we, as fans, of the game can do to help.  Whenever you see these videos, down vote them.  Make your point about the things you enjoy in spite of the issues in the comments.  Create content to counter all the negative points.  Be honest about the flaws, but also point out all the things FO76 is currently doing RIGHT while waiting to see what comes next.
---
I started a Youtube channel BECAUSE of how much I was enjoying FO76.  If I wanted to grow quickly I could jump on the hate train or make super controversial videos that stir up crap just to smell the stink but... that would go against my own sense of right and wrong.  Instead I am making videos based on things I am enjoying (like making the chainsaw a beastly killer of all things irradiated) and answering common questions/pain points that people have and post about here.  It's only by continuing to be the kind of community we want to attract that we can keep the game going long enough to get the chances many of us really want to see so it can survive.
---
In short, don't find it depressing, lead the way in your actions in game and how you present the game to others to get others to look past all the screaming meemies posting crap.
---
Read what sorry?
---
Something Bethesda wrote that said dlc would be free....
---
Just like the thing they wrote about better communications, or monitoring and increasing the stash limit soon? Ignoring the Bethesda switch and bait about DLC being included in sub for ESO? 
---
Yeah ok I'm the one that refuses to read....kids these days :/
---
This is true. I am leveling my second character and the bullet sponginess of the enemies is frustrating(for some reason it was not as much with my first char).
---
But TSE is the major problem of PvP.
---
Maybe there's a way, though Bethesda would have to do the same thing as Google does with code they accept which is merge it into their own and spend just as much Dev time on it as if they coded it themselves, basically a full scale review process. That's normally what happens now when you add a app to the play store for example, it goes under a review process which can take up to a month, even each version goes under the microscope.
---
Yeah, I am also very skeptical of Bethesda's capacity to do such a thing considering how messy this release was. 
---
TSE weapons are still a problem. However, end game damage resistance and HP values of enemies is also a problem.
---
Two separate problems.
---
I hope there's a trading hub area. Make it PvE only so some high levels can't roll in with power armor and destroy everyone just for fun and to troll.
---
Many academic and scientific theories are out there right now that point to yes, we are.
---
I bought Patriotic PA paintjob, light wood floors, modern fireplace and now collecting atoms for Glowing map or lamp with fish (haven't decided yet ;) All atoms were collected through the game challenges, not payed (and not going to) a dime in real money.
---
t-51b + t-60 legs + calibrated shock is very easy to farm
---
you get 100 wight and good defense 
---
For trading, are you talking about stuff disappearing when you go to trade but cancel it after items have been listed for trade so you go back in and no longer see them? They eventually come back. That's just a big we're dealing with
---
I assumed they were duper’s because when I killed him he dropped hella Nuka colas and a bunch of other shit that brought me over weight by like 700. I ended up dropping it in a bush cause I hate the prospect of cheating 
---
i mean the key here is that you sync them with the server, then kick them otherwise you are just giving them what they want.
---
Yeah I lost about 300 but then broke even after my friends kept killing them
---
How did that work out for you?
---
1) You're probably in the wrong subreddit to blame FO76 'fanboys'.
---
2) I completely understand why many Fallout 76 players hate the youtubers currently. Though you can find a good and constructive criticism of the game on youtube, however, there are LOTS of content-makers that tend to spread bad rumors about FO76 and use clickbait thumbnails. It's impossible to disagree with.
---
I see people complaining about the prices there so not sure if this is a "trap" of some sort; but since I've got thousands of points through playing alone and not paid for any, I'll bite 
---
I've got the succulents, the glowing map, the modern fireplace and the mushroom cloud nuke lamp. These are all dope. I also have the shag carpet flooring which is less cool but still alright. Basically I have a very modest looking survivalist cabin from the outside but on the inside it's like some ridiculous 60s playboy paradise, tied together with that bearskin rug.
---
The only thing I regret buying is a face tattoo I bought entirely by accident and will never use, at least not on my current character
---
Don't complain about it too much or everyone will till you that you're exaggerating like they do with me. This getting no legendary shit is the reason I don't play the game as often. Killed 3 scorchbeasts and several of their legendary mobs within an hour. (No, I don't want to talk about their sonar attack). I did not get anything but some level 15 leather and some pipe pistols. 3... scorchbeasts...
---
Can’t wait to join the brotherhood!
---
Lies! It took 2 hours, but a lone protection in the security booth killed a behemoth after it wiped out the rest of security only to be killed by a scorchbeast. I was eating when I came across the scene. Curious of the outcome, so I watched while I finished dinner (Popeye's!) and then ironed my dress shirts and pants, which took longer than expected because fucking cats man. 
---
I assumed because I saw a bunch of very suspicious junk items(I replied explaining it to another guy in this sub)
---
Awesome Job! Could you tell me how  you grinded so many atom missions?
---
Xbox one
---
ND3355
---
I did a bunch of treasure maps so my inventory was way overweight. I then walked to a train station to scrap everything and I disconnected. When I joined back my inventory was all gone except the undroppable stuff like rose sryinger and some holotapes. My guy is naked without even a pip boy. I when I try to use the pip boy it says pip boy is unavailable. 
---
Please help I put in a lot of time and just lost everything
---
I agree with selling caps for real money, that shit is bad.   
---
But saying YouTubers are giving this game a bad rep for duping isn't a legitimate argument. Is it really the fault of the player for taking advantage of something in the game? Sure, morally, maybe you could argue it's bad, but duping shouldn't be in the game to begin with.
---
A similar argument I see being made for other games (fighting games for example) is that people that spam attacks are playing really cheap and should be banned, etc. Again, something like this isn't the fault of the player. If it works and there are no counters, then it's a design flaw in the game.   
---
YouTubers should be criticized if they goof or spread misinformation. But the recent trend of calling them out and saying "they gave the game a bad rep" isn't accurate. I know some YouTubers apparently spread misinformation but most just reported on news.  
---
It's OK if \*you\* enjoy the game, but that doesn't stop it from being broken in a lot of ways.
---
AMS Building also has some scattered around from their experiments.
---
This post isnt getting enough upvotes. These crazy theories to support flawed games and issues with suspension of disbelief are always awful and people spend so much time and effort on them.
---
Nuka cola isn’t junk and I was just wondering because you could by lying on people without having proof especially with that title. They could have legitimate weapons and just be jerks. 
---
Server jump. If they follow you, block them and jump again.
---
That sounds awesome. Could you send  me a screenshot? Also yeah, the face tattoos (all of them) look extremely ugly on ANY character.
---
top of the world 
---
Bethesda being honest again hey ;)
---
Well.. Noone seems to bury the bodys anymore.
---
You've got to get them ripe, before they despawn!
---
Search or eat they said, like we only had two choices.
---
I edited it I had a brain fart cause it’s still early for me my bad
---
Dropping nuka colas? 
---
Saw him twice.   First time he vanished right away, and this was weeks ago.   Second was only a couple days ago, we fought and he ran away at about half health.   Creepy af.   
---
I had a camp by Morgantown attacked by a scortchbeast. Nearly shit my pants when it happened.
---
If an ally revives you, your arm grows magically xd. 
---
Wait, we can choke the wendigo? 8D
---
All good 
---
It’s getting difficult to play this game without feeling like there’s a gatekeeper watching and criticising everything.
---
At the start the community was great, but now there are quite a few whiners who need to get back in their own lane.
---
Ok, have fun....not sure why you needed to inform us that there's a difference between a single player fallout game and multiplayer one.
---
I have a serious case of alt-itus. I would suggest waiting until 15 to do Final Destination.  It will scale the Summerset Special to 15.
---
I did that at both 15 and 25, then pass them along to the latest alt I'm kicking around.  Generally the level 25 one holds up until I can get a weapon that suits the spec I'm aiming for.
---
I've observed it myself though, someone hops and they just don't respawn sometimes 🤔 is it maybe because somebody is in the clubhouse and they can't be respawned "on top" of somebody else?
---
If they knew they was not going to put it in the live game why show it off at all?
---
I've been going back and forth between them lately. I enjoy them both a lot.
---
It's not about making it easy, it's about getting your reward without some clown just taking it away from everyone because the rng gods and spiteful. It's a flawed design, that we gotta tag things before getting the reward. Just accept you're a prick.
---
Found this one too and had the same result :P
---
Just playing the game, never cared so much for them. I play solo only, trying to visit every location in every region, do all the main and side quests, just have fun and fight glitches/bugs/DTCs ...
---
Would this post of ever existed if there were humand in Fallou 76?
---
is bethesda 
---
No I think it’s definitely bugged for RadAway and RadAway: Diluted
---
Imagine being injured so badly that a stimpak wasn't enough, and you could just lay there in agony and bleed out
---
Nah I don't think so because I get ghoul spawned all the time. That's when it really feels like Walking Dead
---
Better even, the hub could be in a VAULT
---
That way it’s also safe from nukes 
---
Run conduit through a wall by first making that wall a doorway. Through the center you can place a connection up to the edge of the doorway, then place the outside piece, then use the replace option to convert the doorway into a solid wall or window. 
---
Did u figure out how to fix this? It just happened to me
---
\*Tips Forehead\* you can't lose junk if you manage your inventory well.

I reached level 49 recently, and Scorchbeasts have been extremely easy for me. I honestly don't get the hate. 
---
I'm Stealth, Unarmed, no PA. I get their attention, crouch to go from [Danger] to [Caution], wait for it to land, which is usually 5-15 seconds, and punch it to death. I stand up and crouch again every time I go from [Caution] to [Danger]. 
---
Even when it WAS attacking me, it barely dealt any damage. I've been terrified of them for weeks, hearing all these horror stories on the sub, and I was disappointed when I finally fought one. Because it was easy. 
---
Mercenary and malicious. That makes sense.

I have a spot near my house that spawn these random events, so far I've seen a crashed Vertibird, Vertibot Supply Drone, Grave's and a Crashed Satellite.
---
Oooo I like that idea a lot. That would work perfectly.
---
Where do you get the scope?
---
It's triggered by the time of day, not by the lack of light. It's not called Dark Eyes.  ;-)
---
Ok, sure.. But no actual machines that move except for Vertibirds and those Cargobots.
---
I agree. Or at least make it underarmor that specifically disallows armor on top of it.
---
Camden Park in the middle of the Roller Coaster is usually a suit of Raider from what I've seen.

Studded Leather with Deep pockets mod.

I am fairly new, but how does that work?

Like run in and tag the enemies - do I need to be in a proximity of 50m or something? 
---
Well, I’m still here talking to you !
---
The frustration of wanting deep pocketed everything as a low lv is what drives nowadays. whenever I see a low lvl  and he is on my route I try to quickly make a handmade plus deep pocketed everything haha.
---
Worst thing in the whole world 
---
Same here.
---
Yeah and literally all the robot enemies... 
---
*allowed
---
Don't know why you got downvoted because it was suggested from day one. For a game that's billed as a multiplayer game it doesn't give you a lot of incentive to group up.
---
I just have pacifist mode turned on. I shoot people all the time in vats on accident
---
Last names would be a good way to help with the unique problem
---
Okay, champ. Flex elsewhere. 
---
While it's not exactly a fairy tale, the event One Violent Night at the Sons of Dane compound is straight fro Beowulf. There's even a bonus to kill the Nightstalker bare handes.
---
They just want to see if pvping you is worth it.
---
its not just you, its bugged or intentional, either way it doesn't make any audio on my end either, you just have to watch their hp bar to determine if youre getting hits
---
I would like this.   I use flares when I'm in trouble but they never get seen or answered.   
---
I play the game  with friends, but we do the same thing. Having fun is more fun than pointing out all the flaws.
---
One spawns near the overseers camp, close to the pickup truck. It can be many different things like a nuke, vertibird, satellite, cargobot, tents, leather right leg joke, and scorchbeast guano piles. The leather leg joke is quite funny as the notes imply that is some of the best armor available. 
---
Yes because the majority of players in modern gaming want instant gratification with little to no effort. Online games are about grinding and being better than noobs.
---
Wow, ok the perks aren’t what make explosive weapons bad. You’re trying to overly complicate things and break shit that is working fine.
---
The answer was always to change the legendary explosive effect itself. For that, it’s simple. First, change explosive effect to deal 5% of weapon damage. Why 5%? Well other legendary effects boost weapons by 10%, if it’s an easy to satisfy condition like being mutated, or 10% stacking for more difficult ones, like bloodied and junkies. Personally I think these effects need a stacking limit, but that’s a different subject. Explosive can hit multiple enemies and has no special condition beyond “durrr pull trigger” so I feel it’s bonus should be the weakest.
---
To illustrate, you have a shotgun that deals 150 damage. And explosive shotgun deals 162.5 damage to a target hit squarely, and any enemy not directly hit and only hit with the explosion takes 12.5 damage. Limb damage is similarly affected. Demo expert will increase the explosive damage ONLY to 25, for a total of 175 a shot. 
---
This retains the gun’s hard hitting power *if you hit.* No more aiming in the general vicinity and blowing up everything without even aiming. 
---
One other part of this is explosive is moved to be a primary effect. It will never appear with Two Shot, Bloodied, Junkie’s or any other major damage boosting effect.
---
One last thing: trying to attack it from the perks side screws with the balance of many other weapons that aren’t OP. That is why I dislike OP’s suggestion so much. It’s a great way to ruin all explosive weapons, like grenades and launchers etc, just to fix one single OP thing. No thanks.

“This OP thing isn’t OP because this other thing is also OP” is not a valid argument. The answer is that they both need balancing.

I fast traveled and had this happen, no matter what I did, even trying to fast travel, wouldn't get out of it.  It wouldn't walk around, move, jump, anything.... Thankfully I didn't lose caps for trying and failing to fast travel.
---
I logged out and then joined a new server only to exit a place to Appalachia, just to get the black screen again....
---
I logged out and then joined a new server AGAIN.... Just for the server to crash.
---
Most of them are misleading anyways, so it’s a win-win to flag them!
---
Go to your “find someone” on Xbox friends tab and type in his username. Once he is located click on join game. It will put you in their world but not on his team.
---
This is, a terrible interpretation.
---
Could’ve been a legendary trip to the loo that wouldn’t drop shit.
---
Vaping gonna get ya.
---
I just got this perk and for me it barely does anything. Outside of making the screen fuzzy it pretty much just raise the gamma by 5% which I can achieve with my screen buttons.
---
16,000 damage is ok then? You’re dreaming. But partially correct. What makes melee OP is not necessarily melee itself but the effects people stack to make it that way.
---
Fix: melee damage foods stacking, “at low HP” effects stacking, and that’s a start.
---
76 is the Creature from Bird Box - it's a simulation 
---
How can they even tell if it's a two shot? I have a explosive shotgun we looted that does 620+ dmg after maxing out damage perks. It one shots everything.
---
Read the patch notes.
---
What does “bulk mean”?
---
Mods are coming that will be on private servers. Already been announced.
---
I love being the “saint” (which I find too flattering to call us nicer fallout players) because it’s so fun spending hours helping lower levels get better guns, level up, and also their happiness when you gift thousands of ammo and plans. I played with a low level and he went out and bought a mic just to tell me how much I helped him and influenced him. Little did he know as pay back for buying that mic I gave him a bunch of 3* legendaries and a full set of excavator 
---
I experience where I'm in vats with 95% chance, I'm not moving, they will roam a little as the close in on me and I will unload shot after shot and not a dang bit of DMG. Once I jump out of vats I'm fine and it's not everytime just depends on the server I'm in.
---
Dude that sounds like some awesome fun lol
---
I'm still amazed Bethesda completely ignores this as a balancing issue. All other weapons are so far behind TSEs it's not even amusing. 
---
Get carnivore. Eat 1 raw meat every half hour or 1 cooked every hour if your that lazy. For drink get a water purifier and drink only purified water or grab cola nut rank 1 and drink 1 nuka cola every hour 
---
This is a gun id like to use. Do you happen to know what the damage is on it? and are you invested into perks for the damage at all? just curious. 
---
Choke the wendigo, Strangle the Snallygaster, whatever you wanna call it these days &gt;:D
---
Why was this removed? 
---
It was fun just very hectic at the end when all the people started converging 
---
I stick still get atoms for stupid stuff like drinking a single Nuka cherry or scrapping 5 pipe weapons. 
---
As we speak of it - I've found the note, tried to do all the things on the list (get drunk, loud, play music etc.) and waited for nightstalker to spawn, but no success. So it's an event for that ;)
---
The Shielded Raider Underarmor is an upgrade to Raider Underarmor. You need that one first, before being able to upgrate to Shielded, eventually.
---
Genius 
---
Me brick. Me strong. 
---
I have found exactly one explosive weapon since creating account.  I am currently level 96.
---
One.
---
Mutant Slaying Plasma Gatling (Explosive) which was great for about 10 seconds and breaks.   Dropped that in favor of the crafted handmade.
---
I don't farm nuke zones or surf sites for the spots where legendary mobs spawn though.  I just enjoy the game for what it is. 
---
So for a \*normal\*, non-cheaty, non-server-hopping player; they are very, very rare.
---
a duper with 700 weight is probably not a duper tbh, just someone that has a hard time working out which loot to carry and which to let go.
---
In a full nuke run my weight can get up to that easily before i even look through my loot and throw the trash, its just easier to carry on looting then sort through it all at once. Doesn't really matter if i loose a few screws with an unexpected death can always get more.
---
Good to see though, that yet again someone is making wild accusations based on assumptions! Got to love this sub!
---
The game is better way past 50, as you have loads more cards to swap out and make more powerful builds that you can swap easilybetween, including all the PA related perks that repar it to 200% for half the materials etc etc
---
I really don't know Drake even as a hardcore Fallout fan i have had to step away from the game. The game has to succeed because our next Fallout game is probably 10 years off.
---
It has to for that reason alone.
---
Yea weird, I’ve only ever been attacked twice, and once by someone who was a lot lower level.
---
I picked up the Starlet Sniper Outfit and love it.
---
I was playing yesterday, came across Uranium Fever. Joined 2 mid lvl 90s. I'm 99. They both were using the same TSE shotgun. I've only ever seen 1 two shot item ever drop. Of course it's duped.
---
Lucky I get stacks on stacks of stupid explosive vent mods lmao
---
&gt; Get carnivore.
---
I don't know if you realize how absurd it is to tell people to just get a mutation.
---
Or to go pay thousands of caps for an endgame serum.
---
Exactly
---
I honestly don’t know, but I know I’ve come across chests full of gear and loot.
---
Fallout 3 cut out a lot of RPG features found in Fallout 2.
---
New Vegas added those features from Fallout 2 back in.
---
Fallout 4 literally cut out all the RPG features that New Vegas added and removed even more shit like skills. 
---
Server are everywhere Amazon has a “cloud” presence.  I haven’t seen a lot of Network/connectivity lag,  but have seen a good bit of latency in the servers keeping up with the player load. What platform are you playing on?
---
reminds me of my first nuke in F76 - travelled to watch it, a bright flashing light followed by a bluescreen...
---
You probably bought the plan for the shielded lining. You also need the plan for the actual under armor. Either raider leathers or harness I believe. The robo vendors usually sell them. 
---
Depending on your build you can do everything in just a hazmat suit, so really it comes down to what do you like best versus how hard are you willing to grind to get schematics?
---
It also depends on the vendor. Whitesprings train doesnt buy junk for example. Raiders do though.
---
Problem for me is that it's too much stories requiring reading terminals/notes/holotapes to do it in team. Currently I'm lvl 65, visited barely 2/3 of map locations and only moment I plan to play with team is SBQ raid. But I'm far away in quests to do it...
---
I'll have to remember that
---
Nitpicking, but sure.  
---
My intent was *zero player rideable mechanical locomotion devices*.
---
If this was about a mod, I wish they reference most downloaded or endorsed mods also. By "reference" I mean, import them to vanilla game.
---
That’d be an actual godsend.
---
I think the community is what really saved this game.
---
It’s not necessarily a wild assumption because prior to the “war” the game was lagging insanely and everyone in my party felt it and it was the level 20 who dropped it and there was a fuck ton of bulk crystal and ballistic fiber which is crazy to me. I don’t understand why people get so defensive over when people talk about duper’s in the sub and immediately downvote any sub that remotely mentions them in a bad light 
---
At that level, it sounds like you're about ready to head out east, into the Mire and Cranberry Bog. Lots of tough enemies and rich rewards to be found in those regions, which should be an ample challenge for you! If you find they're a bit much, then stick to the Savage Divide region and all of the raider camps now overrun by supermutants, scorched and such. In general terms, the further east you go, the tougher the enemies. 
---
Deep pocketed leather armor has bailed me out so many times.
---
A lot of people that have been playing for a while are maxed out in caps (25k). 
---
I found one the other day and got a bit disappointed when cutting the wrong wire made an explosion just slightly bigger than a mini nuke.. Blast didn't even kill me (I was wearing my Power Armor and stood right on the thing when it started beeping, for science)
---
Never build near Lake Eloise. I tried that. Made my base as small and hidden as possible, but *they* can and will find you. 
---
Upvote as I would also like for it to be implemented but during the demo it was probably only two people on the server so they could programme the mesh files to keep a track of all the little pieces and tell the server that they belong to that player or it was done offline. 
---
I don’t think Bethesda put it in enticingly and then removed it in a sinister way, I think they probably removed it after realising how it would affect stability
---
Great, this is what I was looking for. Thanks, will throw that garbage out asap! 5% more damage here I come ehehe
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Same going on for while now for me. 
---
Only lands if you go for the wings
---
worth considering indeed. thanks!
---
I will agree with you that the effects stacking is what can make it OP. It just irks me when people just generalize melee as OP because as a standalone method of combat its totally fine. 
---
You want areas that have high enemy density and that you can still handle.  When I leveled my shotgunner I found Whitesprings pretty easy with rank 3 enforcer.  Use the shotgun to shoot them in the legs until they fall on their faces and after crippling all of them grab a melee weapon and finish them off to save shotty shells and durability.
---
ah yep forgot this one. use it and love it :) 
---
It would be twice as emotional if the shots actually killed someone and did not do 99% reduced damage 
---
I enjoyed doing that in 4 at the BoS airport's parking lot. If you did it right it will just keep going in an ascending/descending spiral of booms. 
---
This is a pretty wild assumption to be honest.
---
I don't farm that many nuke zones, but whenever it's up, I'll join. I do lots of events, and just doing quests etc.  
---
Not all the explosive weapons have been great.. The laser pistol sucked:)  
---
The pump had 2 other meh effects, but it's still an explosive pump, so sold for a lot:)  
---
I guess 2 good explosive weapons and 2 bad is above average lucky..
---
I was doing the Brotherhood Line in the Sand event a few days ago, showed up to 2 or 3 other people working on it thankfully, I'm level 30 now so would have been rough on my own. Problem was, i barely got to loot anything because off all the explosions from the higher levels guns. I couldn't see what to shoot at, and god forbid i try to fight something on my own, I'd just end up in the middle of a storm of Hellfire.
---
They really should look at toning down the particle density for explosions from weapons like that. Or give us a system config to turn it down, so we don't have to see huge explosions with every shot from an already fast weapon.
---
I'm at work today but will post some pics later. If I can work out how (am on Xbox and haven't figured it out yet)
---
Lol exactly 
---
It's the same menu used when in power armor. I prefer it even though it bugs out sometimes. 
---
Fair enough:) Just annoying when people just assume any explosive weapon is a dupe..
---
Nice collection of information.  Lets hope Bethesda sees this.
---
FYI, when putting this much effort in gathering information, maybe tag one of the Bethesda community managers.  When tagging multiple it will only tag the first two due to some reddit limitations.

Great post! That gives me comfort that there will be a stable player base for the foreseeable future and Bethesda's masters will not force them to pull the plug due to share holder revenues dropping. Although I suppose that does rely on new sales of the game and a steady revenue from the in game purchase of Atom points for 'de bling'.
---
So we can spend even more caps traveling to people's camps? No thanks, I will stick with going to train stations only...
---
You think that's air you're breathing?
---
Remove anything connected above it.  Had this problem trying to removed a wall with a door to put in a solid wall, had to remove the half wall above it AFTER I removed the single roof panel above that one.  Connectivity and dependency are a bit weird in this game, as a final work around, I ended up moving the camp and deleting everything as starting over-not fun
---
What nobody else in this thread seems to know, but which is actually really cool, is this: 
---
There's a LOAD of "random encounters" in this game, and this nuke is one of them. If you were to revisit that specific location ten times, you'd probably find ten different interesting things in that spot. Among other such things that can spawn in "random encounter" locations are things like an old tank surrounded by military robots, a couple of tents with some plans for the Trapper armor set, a crashed satellite filled with high-tech scrap, a pair of arguing Mr. Handies and more. 
---
I know where a bunch of these "random encounter" spots are and visit them regularly to see what odd things might pop up there. 
---
There are stories of people killing others with or shot slap damage. Who knows for sure if it is true. No videos 
---
I'm a solo player. why should I care whether you tagged (leeched) my kill?
---
go blame Todd for making this dumpster fire always online. I'm certainly not gonna give a fuck.
---
I tend to use the Overseer's camp / Flatwood to drop off most of my excess gear, I was doing some tidying up of my main character last night and dropped a good few hundred rounds of various ammo types off, plus a few decent low level weapons that I had acquired. I must start using my microphone a bit more though, much easier to tell someone to come back and check the crate, rather than chase them in power armour down a dark road and make the "follow me" gesture, and hope they don't get the wrong idea.
---
What platform are you on. I’ll sell you one for 500.
---
I have been put in my place
---
See, I would love that, but I maintain that Bethesda's team working on this game doesn't have the chops for it.
---
I look at what No Man's Sky devs did with the game. At first, we had to throw our hamhocks into hoof mode, and run across planets. Later they added drivable crafts of various sizes, and eventually even a motorcycle and a submarine. But those devs are intimate with their game, so there's nothing they can't do with it, if they really want to. By comparison, this Bethesda team is acting like they borrowed their body for the weekend, and haven't figured out how it works yet. So as much as I'd love to see robotic trains around Appalachia, or the ability to find and restore one of those motorcycles you see on roads, and ride them, I'm 97% sure it's not going to happen.
---
I know guitars are kinda ugly but they're not that bad imo. Gifted a bloodied one with swing speed &amp; +1 endurance to a player because I couldn't carry it. He still send me thank you's sometimes, lol. And we played a lot together.
---
I saw this! I didn't get the joke, though. Thanks for clearing it up. :) 
---
Also: "Thank You"
---
This game needs to say "I'm sorry" :p
---
I like the red rocket 
---
Yeah I once left to go make and eat a full dinner and took my time getting back and I still was on with time to spare lol
---
You get 1% good stuff at Whitesprings?! :-O You lucky sob!
---
Yeah i agree , it probably wont. But its a cool idea.
---
I only hope this is a response to the TSE Dupe thing.  Perhaps they are trying to address the issue, which is outstanding.
---
Again your making assumptions, just because you value ballistic fibre doesn't mean everyone else does you get that right? Level has nothing to do with it either you can farm Ballistic fibre at low levels very very easily.
---
And again just because the server got unstable doesn't mean it was defo because of dupers does it? I mean Bethesda haven't jumped on the band wagon and stated the dupers are the ones breaking the servers, its this sub and people making assumptions that have decided that.
---
I down vote for assumptions and re posts nothing else, if this person can prove his claims then great but if not it just hurts the game like all that bitching on the other sub did.
---
Scorch\*hit huge great piles of it...
---
That’s fine then. The only real base advantages melee has is the best armor defeating perk, and a bit more base damage on the weapons. Pretty reasonable. But having high damage per hit is what makes people using low hp buff builds use them.
---
Maybe it’s better to say “rebalance buff stacking.”
---
Currently cutting about in a spacesuit, witches hat and aviators 
---
I apoligise as refering to my character as a pam build i rarely see myself so hasmat suit and power armoue it is.. when i start to spex into non pa then ill think about it
---
Patty is s necrophiliac. Let's just say she is very happy with all the corpses lying about.
---
Because the design of the loot system is seriously flawed. There are some events that won't spawn a legendary till the end, I lost many legendaries because some one showed up last second to Insta kill my target before I reached it. Time felt wasted.
---
This sounds crazy but what if we actually are just people interacting with a virtual world that exists in an alternate reality. Like what if there's just some controller controling our character making him do things. CRAZY
---
But good theory op! Combines a lot of the evidence I've seen posted over the last month.
---
(This is what I thought because of "Literally")[https://youtu.be/YersIyzsOpc]
---
Get the perk to make double the Chems, then the perks to make them more effective then I dilute them to get even more. 
---
I use a non explosive TS Shotgun when fighting Mobs in a crowd, it makes sure I tag everything, but don't kill them all before others get to as well, make sure you are in Pacifist mode before going into blast zones, then you have nothing to apologize for.
---
The players that are OHKing everything before others get a shot at it, are the ones that need the emote, but then they wouldn't use it anyway.
---
I would love to see a ***Turn your Damn Mic On!*** Emote. it makes cooperative (non Team) play &amp; trading so much easier.
---
ive had a single two shot weapon drop for me and its not explosive, likewise ive had an explosive .38 drop but it's not two shot
---
id say the majority at least are copied/duped
---
Known issue Bethesda has said they are working on.  Hit point is below and to the left of the aiming point by about 30 degrees
---
If you got rank 3 of ballistics, just make it all into ammo, much lighter.
---
You can steal from the stash as they do it, but prepare to be shot at before getting close. If you do get it, leave world, enter a new one, then drop the items in a deep area of water so people can't get to them or accidentally run across them.
---
Too bad there aren't a lot of beggars in this game, finishing events and launching nukes isn't hard, but being able to claim my work so far has proven to be difficult.
---
Strictly power armor speaking? I carry two frames at all times, Excavator for carry weight if needed, and the X-01 for nuked zones since it has the highest rad resistance out of all the rest and it's pretty good with damage resistance. If you're able to collect all T-60 parts at level 50 then it's better for Damage resistance than the Enclave but still lower rad resistance for nuke zones. 
---
All of the X-01  plans are given at the end of Enclave quests.
---
Now if you didn't mean power armor specifically, best armor to have are legendaries, some level 50 some 45. And all depends on their added effects and your play style. But highest damage resistance ones are Combat armor with brotherhood mod, Scout armor is pretty good and the marine armor as well. 
---
Smells like salty tears. How tf are you gonna complain people are 1 shotting enemies. F*CK that, last I saw the objective was to kill things not let the live for others to feed off your hard work.
---
Most non-classical radios in the open world have been playing static since the end of the beta, I'm guessing there's some bug with them that they haven't bothered fixing yet and just disabled the ability to make them.
---
I had used a radio plan back in beta as well and it's no longer craftable in the workstation.
---
I have gotten the same gattling gun 3 times in the watoga  school. I mean yeah  they could be, or could not be. Ive also got the same 2 shot 10m in the same nuke at white springs.
---
I sure do, but won't say where on here, don't want it fixing (it's pretty much a bug), if you can PM on here? Feel free to PM me...
---
A large portion of the Forest is off limits for nukes.   This gives lower level players a safe place to keep grinding away while the rest of the server goes nuts.   
---
Go to **Watoga Emergency Services**, equip **Pharma Farma** lvl3 in Luck tree, and search the 2 floors full of med kits/doctor bags/mirrors. Once you’re finished searching just leave the building and re-enter, all the searches will be refreshed.
---
&gt;Maybe it’s better to say “rebalance buff stacking.”
---
Yes. Maybe make it so only one buff can be active at a time (chems, low hp, etc). Probably not the best idea, just one off the top of my head.
---
I don't even play that much, just reached level 87 i believe and i preordered the game, but i've already gotten about three two shot weapons and two explosives, maybe not tses yet but it is possible. Maybe some people just have more luck than others, plus there's the no lifers that are already lv200+ who most likely have found a tse by themselves.
---
Nice collection of PA info.  Thanks for putting it together, and even more thanks for the clean formatting.

Songwriters: John Cash
---
And you referenced the song, I can dig it, but again, the reference was the correct line but the wrong horse again.
---
The white horse reference was the beginning of the song, referencing (Conquest), but the line you referenced was actually from the end of the song when he referred to the pale horse(Death).

its probably that some one higher level spawned it or pulled it over to that area, 9/10 when i wasa low level id run and not look back abd survive them annoying encounters, hell they even made it fun sometimes lol
---
If its an issue though just switch server and that should sort it out for ya :)

rule of thumb for me was under 20 first time you hear that flapping or screeching get on your toes and GTFO

have the luck to be able to find some cures, with the benefit of being able to have almost 90 stimpacks

Currently I am running a character based off one of the fan theories I have seen on here that Vault 76 wasn't filled with the best and brightest, just those who were willing to do literally anything to survive (like the overseer's situation with the love of her life).  
---
I made a character that is a vegan (herbivore), because in his experience they are often more worth being around than human beings.  He greatly believes that humanity is currently in a state of evolution and that only the most committed will survive (many mutations) and that only those willing to do whatever it takes to survive even ONE MORE DAY will make the changes humanity needs to survive and never get back to this bring of extinction again.  He was never known to be intelligent (book smarts) but his practical knowledge was hard earned and often in need by others.  
---
He disdains firearms, energy weapons, and most explosives because he feels that devices used strictly for destruction are what lead us to this point in time now.  He prefers weapons that have other uses as well, a trusty knife for day to day usage.  A well worn axe for homestead maintenance.  A chainsaw for clearing dead trees and laying up a supply of fire wood.  
---
He looks down on those who use bulky armor that restricts their movement and that has questionable positive benefits at best.  He prefers to harden himself through training and practical skill based learning to harden himself and improve his chances to survive.  This combined with his choice to spend time in heavy radiation areas to try and force evolutionary changes in himself has made him less human... but far more of a survivor.
---
He might be losing his mind though, he has started having long and loving conversations with "Lucy", his best gal, the love of his life... and also the chainsaw that he has been murdering anyone who dares to stand in the way of his evolutionary personal growth.  Time will tell :-)
---
A loser who tried to jump off a cliff as soon he went out of V76 because the Wasteland is too scary - get resurrected few sec after being flat dead at V76 entrance - believes he's immortal, becomes a super hero.
---
Hmmm I don’t recall seeing anything but one wheel. No indication of a second one. I’ll check again when I play next time. 
---
Thank you - I wouldn't have been looking for Leathers, just underarmor. How confusing.

Hell yeah I’ll do it my man. My gt is Kuso24. Just add me and invite whenever u wanna run it 
---
Banjo Kazooie indoctrination theory when?
---
We.. like it alot too and.. hope you join our.. little enclave. 
---
A good indication of if they are a previous duper is if they hang out in whitesprings with that much stuff on them. It takes alot of work to go all the way around the map that over encumbered. I've seen a group of dupers set up camp on the golf course and I went to buy a gun from someone the other day and they insisted whitesprings, as soon as I joined the lobby everything was chugging extremely hard. Walking to the door looked like I was using a pc with the frame rate set at 25. I go to make the deal and the guy has hundreds of serums and 4 of the exact same gun. I just left with ought buying it, I would rather buy from someone who earned their stuff than used exploits to make copies. 
---
Are you suggesting that they wipe ONLY the TSE weapons? Because that is a 'simple' fix, not a good one. Sorry to be blunt, but that's absolutely stupid. Complain about what you will, but as long as SB have attacks that make it near impossible to even see them while they attack you, I'm never getting rid of my TSE. as long as Super Mutants continue to soak up ammo and Mirelurk Kings continue to be... Themselves.. never giving up that TSE. 
---
It's insane how many people complain about these weapons, aside from my friends and maybe 2 others I've never even seen another TSE and I'm always hopping around to different events. 
---
And if people DO roll up and start trolling me and destroying my base, I just throw on Pacifism and ignore him. Don't feed into people, just makes it worse. They want a reaction, they want you to leave or fight back. Just ignore them completely.

I believe there is 4 total counting the initial one.  But the higher ranks will not show on vendors unless you purchased the others already.
---
Try starting a new character 
---
What kind of damage is it considered? Energy? 
---
Idk It would be cooler to implement a few select songs specially for the JukeBox, like some old swing music. 
---
So I have to restart everything? I was lvl140 would I lose all of that? Or what do u mean
---
Wow a tse plasma gatling? That thing's gotta be op. I just have a crappy 1 star bloodied plasma gatling and it's probably my best gun(on my heavy weapons guy)... granted I just hit 50 on my heavy gunner yesterday. I do have a ts auto grenade launcher but I haven't used it yet since for some reason none of the perks apply to it except demo. It's a bit heavy for me to want to carry it around.
---
I love it!
---
Been there too. I was just trying to be nice and helpful and suddenly a hoard of 68 muties spawned. I was just kinda, ooop sorry mate, Ill clean up my mess here. Please just shoot them and get the xp.......
---
.... just lol. We already know this... I'm suggesting there is more of a traceable story through Appalachia in regards to the murder blocks.... something more immersive and interesting than a Stanley Kubrick reference ... which have obviously been easy to spot and no one had to point out the obvious ;) ... a hidden storyline is what I am thinking... or at least one that's obscure enough to not have been done by everyone already
---
You! Go into the corner and think about what you've done! 
---
This.  Every time server starts lagging or start getting the controls are disconnected error message i search for dupers and sure enough always two guys, 1 high 1 low in the middle of nowhere.  Then bam.  Server disconnect.  
---
Nothing. I'm well past 5k without even trying (I do not check daily/weekly thingies), and there's nothing I want from the store. I might have been interested in camo paint, but it doesn't work with upgraded versions, so that's out. I would have liked some interesting tattoos or face paint, but the stuff they put in so far is low effort or just completely asinine (like the "No One" thing). 
---
Yes.  Go with Slugger (two handed).
---
Very nice!
---
It would be fun to see this ingame.. you're probably right 
---
I haven't found an explosive shotgun in 76 yet, but I have blown my own legs off with one if Fallout 4. It is tremendously fun.
---
So funny.  I just watched this the other day.  I left the M Ouija comment.
---
I finally gave in and bought 76 when I found a deal for $20... After 6 hours, I've had a handful of server disconnects, nothing too painful though.  My pain is purely from the game mechanics, UI, recurring quests, enemy AI and everything else related to interacting with the world I want to explore.  I do not need a favorite wheel in place of my FOV adjustment when I use the mouse wheel.  I do need something other than PipBoy when I need to use an item quickly because there is no longer any pause.  I need at least individual player quests to not be broken to the point I can retrieve the item or complete an action, have it reset and repeat that action several times before the quest proceeds to the next stage or completes itself minutes later.  I need skills, SPECIAL, perks and crafting to make some sort of sense.  I've been playing Fallout games since FO1 was released.
---
I am intentionally NOT including many of the issues already reported by everyone playing this game.
---
Basically, I really need Bethesda to strip out 80% of their 'improvements' to the FO4 interface and controls.  Give me that and I'll put up with the stuttering, broken quests, enemy AI, lack of NPCs, server disconnects and everything else proper player testing and QA should have addressed.  
---
If Bethesda can get 76 to an Early Access level of playability I will consider my $20 bucks well spent.
---
If you do the Mayor for a Day quest in Watoga you can pick up 8 stimpacks from the safe you unlocked as a reward... every time you server hop.
---
You can also farm the following locations with some level of Pharma Farma equipped (remember you need to press a button to get the extra search chance)
---
Flatwood Church + Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center - Tons of Med boxes 3-12 stimpacks per run
---
Morgantown Airport - 5-15 stimpacks per run
---
AVR Medical Center in Charleston - 8-16 stimpacks per run
---
Pleasant Point (mothman museum on map) - 6-10 per run (make sure you loot the responder bodies)
---
Watoga Emergency Services - 8-14 per run
---
You will also find that depending on a players build and playstyle some use far less stimpacks than others so that's how they end up with so many.  On my unarmed character after I got into the 30s I stopped using them almost completely, especially with the healing mutation.
---
Try a new character and see what happens. Basically though you just admitted to using a bunch of duped treasure maps so I don’t really have any sympathy for you. 
---
I mean the food/water thing isn't too terrible and makes sense. Just imagine if you were running around that much. A 50mile hike per day really works up an appetite. 
---
Nice! I didn't know they would refresh. 
---
The amount of salt on these forums is sad. If you are level 230 and you don't have a TSE by now, you are just jealous over your shit luck. There are a dozen weapons with the right perks that one shot everything. 
---
I have a TSE pipe rifle. Nothing on my character is from duping, and your assumption that every TSE is from a duper is just pathetic. 
---
Is it possible that your language barrier is also making you a hypocrite? "Mate, we all have duped items, and it is ok, that is why I agree with an item wipe." 
---
No item wipes, some of us actually have earned all our gear. 
---
Rose's quest takes you through a lot of the Divide, which is meant for like level 30+.   Yes, it can be done at lower levels, and, yes, even some level 30s are going to struggle with certain parts.   
---
Did anyone here play Morrowind?  If you went to the wrong area before you could handle it, the game didn't 'balance'   itself and lob you a nice underhand pitch so you could still walk away victorious. It punished you mercilessly over and over and over until you got the idea and came back stronger.   
---
It's normal.   Keep trying.   Grind a little and go back.   It's a game, theres supposed to be some challenging aspects.
---
Every games company really lol
---
Nah. I’ve been buying them on the trade reddit for 20 caps a piece for the last week. I’m not sure if they were duped or not but I didn’t dupe them
---
I don't care about the economy at all. Until there are player vending machines or an auction house, it doesn't make much difference. If they did put up an auction house, it would be a lot easier to see who the cheaters are. I don't understand why they can't just run a DB query and see which players have 100,000 of something and just get rid of them.
---
I have up to resistant but have never seen protective at any vendor. Maybe just bad luck
---
Hardly.
---
I said, increase other weapons and grenades by the amount you reduce the  perk's %.   
---
So if Demolition perk got reduced by 50%, all explosive weapons (fatman f.e.) get a 50% increase in dmg.
---
Not gonna lie, this made me snort coffee through my nose :-p What's really fun is when you realize that those greedy folks who try to take everything for themselves using the TSE shotties can easily be made to suicide themselves by getting your friends together to jump in front of their face while they are shooting.  Slap damage to you, full face wrecking damage to them.
---
Where do you get nuclear key cards?
---
Can only read the top part of this because you deleted it. The reason it gets a bad rep is because it's exploiting a game to get things for free when people are putting in the time and not getting a sliver of the stuff they are. These people even earn irl money by using exploits. 
---
Lol at the 2 launchers and 4 laser turrets. Admitting you have a problem is the first step lol
---
Nah, it still doesn't really work out. Lots of times tse user thinks everyone tagged whatever, but theres shitloads of people standing in the way or lowbies haven't hit the damage threshold to get credit. Just don't use TSE during events/nuke zones. It saves everyone trouble. Besides it's not like things don't die ridiculously quickly anyway.
---
Lol i did this but i wad 72 and he like 34
---
I thought mutations disappeared anyway.
---
Nobody needs Ionized meat so they skip it. As for random meat piles with the other lootables, probably people to impatient to wait for it to load the inventory.
---
I don't really mind the eating and drinking but I absolutely hate how there are so many bland perk cards that people end up taking because 76 can't make-up it's mind on what kind of game it wants to be.
---
All the carry weight cards are boring but I end up taking a few of them because otherwise certain weapons are horrifically heavy to run.
---
Similarly a lot of the Endurance perks that deal with eating/drinking/disease/health are pretty much useless since food/antibiotics/stimpacks are amazingly plentiful.
---
I'm also on the fence about the whole weapon durability thing since I don't understand why perks like Weapon Artisan are pretty much required for the Queen. Like why would you make a game that has a carry weight limit, then make all the guns heavy (looking at you rifle users), then make the only end-game content in the game be such a horrific bullet sponge that half the time people are fumbling around to find a workbench to repair stuff in the middle of combat?
---
Here is a trick brother.  Go farm ALL the mutations.  Then take a radway to remove one.  If it's the one you wanted gone, sweet, Starched Genes rank 2 goes on and you are locked in.  If it's one you wanted to keep, quickly farm it up again and try again.
---
[My "alt" as my main is kind of just me]
---
If "dirty Sal" knows one thing, it's how to profit in a bad situation. Growing up in the vault, he saw there was plenty of the stuff that you need, but not that much stuff you want. So he decided to make a market based on it. And he had to make as many friends as possible because he gained a bunch of weight and started balding really early. 
---
But now that the vault is open, he can make a profit for real. The first thing he noticed was that there was plenty of money everywhere, though no one will take it. That's okay, he's going to make money great again. The second, is that there is no Gentleman's club in the apocolypse, something he intends to change (as soon as I can afford neon letters).So he's running around, collecting booze, chems, etc. as well as pre-war money. He's always got a few on him so that if he stays in someone's camp, he can lay a few bills on the bed before leaving (something I've only gotten to do twice). 
---
I don't mind if they are actually there and killing the ghouls and such but when there base is just there taking my kills, that's when I get the most frustrated.
---
Honestly I blame youtubers for making videos telling people to do this exact thing...
---
Fair enough, I'll give it more tries, maybe it was bugs... Thanks for the advicd
---
Starched genes perk
---
Wanna help the future future generations of the atoms cats ;=)
---
I help others. I gift my extra loot to low-level players because I remember how I felt when I stepped out of the vault with a head full of wanderlust... and a poor excuse of a tool for survival.
---
I agree with Busy. Punctuation is important.
---
How do you think modding will work with your character save file? Thinking back to fo4, if you activate mods, you had to make a new "modded” save file, in case the mods broke the game you could revert back to your vanilla character. I dont see how it would work with your character file not saved locally.
---
The more important question is would you be able to jump back and forth between modded and non modded servers? I would think not, but i guess a lot of that depends on what will be allowed in private servers.
---
It would be one thing if a modded server could be used to fix bugs /performance/ gameplay issues, where there isnt really anything your character could acquire that would be unfair in the unmodded world.
---
But if modded servers are a free for all, that allow duping and (legendary) item creation, I dont see how theyd allow you to transfer back.
---
Forgot about that guess I will do something else
---
It's a weak argument to me. I got a TSE handmade and it's done nothing but greatly improved the quality of the game for me. While I do kind of miss my strategic shoot outs, I DONT miss having to back peddle while dumping 200+ rounds in 5 SM with sledgehammers hoping I don't get caught in a repeating staggering animation. 
---
I'll take that trade any day. Can't tag enemies? How do only melee players feel? They have to find a way to compensate, so do you.  Use a high fire rate auto weapons and spray the area. Use molotovs. Find a way around it. 
---
Not to mention treasure maps are not hard to get, I personally have almost two of each and five of others. They are not rare Compared to other items. I think what they are saying is try starting a new character and going back to the one you use. If they did this as a response to being overweight as a fix to the duper situation I think that sucks and do not think it's fair at all for you to be caught in the crossfire. I've had my pipboy unavailable before, check your connection and everything else. On a side note how do you know you have a holo tapes if your pip boy is unavailable? 
---
No one said not to farm without your tse, they're saying share events and nuke zones. The shit's gonna die ultra fast regardless, you don't need to be a dick and make it impossible for others to get xp and legendaries. There is a **lot** of farming to do outside of nuke zones and events. 
---
I mean someone was just literally telling you to change your play style because it isn't fair to others how good you are. That's just so crazy to me! 
---
Press Home and then press Y, after their done uploading, go to xboxdvr. (It's a website that shows everyones screenshots.)
---
I have other stuff as well but I have more blackberry than anything else just because of how common they are. I’m a cannibal so I just sell the berries or turn them into tea.
---
I can see them when I got into my stash box and they are on the left side for my inventory 
---
I have 8 corn, 6 nutfruit (spelling?), 12 carrots, 6 melons, 12 tato, and 8 blackberry bushes.
---
I make the Vegetable Medley Soup when possible: 1 Salt, 1 Carrot, 1 tato, 1 boiled water.
---
Other times make corn soup. 
---
Then make tons of blackberry juices.  Not an issue really.  about 5 minutes of time at the camp.
---
.. and crashes my client.   In or outside the PA.
---
People like to spread rumors
---
With the low market price of serums, there is no reason to waste your time on this.
---
Is the Armorer Perk (I think it is that one) allowing you to put it on? I have ran into some mods that even though I have learned it, I cannot add it because of the perk is not high enough.
---
Usually some caps, two weapons, and a bunch of junk. The weapons I usually just sell but every once in a while a decent one drops.
---
And yah treasure maps are pretty easy to get. I pretty much ran into like 10-20 people that had as many as you do and I bought all I could
---
If we are being serious about this, as in its some sort of vault tech experiment, then it can't be the case.  The existence of the brother hood of steel ruins the theory.  It was something that was formed after the bombs dropped and for all intents and purposes Vault-Tec seemed to have lost most of its ability to do anything meaningful after this point as well.  Building a simulation, including events after the bombs dropped, seems unlikely.  My guess is the devs are just poking fun at real life us playing a video game.
---
Awesome theory and evidence gathering! I really hope it’s not a simulation though :( I really like Appalachia and the lore it has brought with it and I’d love for it to be canon 
---
Below level 50, a perk point only applies to the perks available at the specific level you got the point at.   
---
Example: You level up to 30 and have a point to spend.   You want to wait and spend the point on a perk you don't unlock until level 32.   You level up twice more and have 3 points to spend.   The first point is only going to apply to perks that were available at 30, the second point only for 31, and finally the last point you can spend on that perk you wanted.   So it wasn't worth saving in the first place.   
---
Fine! Maybe they should change the name too while they’re at it :P
---
The ones you already bought will no longer be shown on the vendor at all.
---
Gotcha my mistake, fixed it. I would recommend checking your connection and also maybe try joining a recent player on a separate server than the ones you yourself connect to. 
---
It's actually fairly easy to get them.. Just server hop and get a few mutations. Get a bad one, use radaway and pray. Repeat untill you have a few of them ones you want, then just buy serums for the rest of the important ones. (some are really meh and do allmost nothing, so doesnt matter if you get them or not)    
---
It seems to be the fastest way of getting the mutations you want, and serums are fairly cheap now on the FO76 market subreddit. (farming a few first is just to save some caps)
---
Same with Xbox. I got use to it from PubG, but I think FO76 is worse.
---
Ok thx
---
Fair enough.  I don’t get why we do not get 4K on XboxOneX...
---
Sounds like its bad luck man. I have a day one xbox one and I'm able to play for multiple hours without any crashes or disconnects. The other day I played for 6 hours straight with neither of those. 
---
Had literally the same thing happen to me . Now I cannot get back into a server with a Nuked zone .
---
I don’t understand what’s going on with the xbox but it’s driving me crazy!
---
That’s unnecessarily complicated. This is Bethesda we are talking about. It’s best if we only give them one thing to change.
---
well its nice you mention duping but..
---
how bout you make a thread about the fact that the game is STILL borderline unplayable, instead of attacking a boogeyman?
---
Lets remove furioua and bezerker for melee. Oh and while we are at it adrienline and nerd rage those do damage too.  Infact lets just do away with all legendarys and perk cards that increase damage because that guy over there wants to only use collecting, salavage, carry weight, and quality of life perks.
---
I'm thinking of scraping my pistol/shotgun build, and getting myself up to high level before really doing anything, just so I can have the super powerful summerset
---
Well.
---
It's a 3star with also the effect of being protected during reload. Sounds op? Yes. Until you shoot with it and it breaks after the second round. 
---
It's super heavy and I don't have the perks for it. I'll probably take it in a nuke zone or something but I honestly can say I ain't fan of it.
---
I just keep it because I guess they'll end up boosting energy/heavy weapons.
---
Is this not all this is though? Just whining? Like it's the fucking apocalypse man. If it wasn't TSE doing it, it would just be melee builds. 
---
I've been saving to consider either selling them for irl cash on a legit site (Noone complain because people sell duped all serums on ebay for like $10 and TSE weapons for upwards of $40 shits ridiculous and at least my work is honest) 
---
Are there any mutations and stats that by themselves affect shotgun damage?
---
I like X-01 as an overall good power armor for most uses. Getting mods was a pain, so Just saved up caps and bought them on reddit..     
---
I also have excavator with leg mods for carrying stuff.. Comes in handy. You could live full time in a modded excavator if you are hoarder, they have good rad resist, so they are fine for nuke zones. 
---
I'm curious, why did you need to remove starched genes for a lockpick loadout? 
---
Nice!
---
You don't need scrapper to get the lead. Scrapper increases yield is all. 
---
If you did this a day or two ago, I was there on your drop.  I was interested in checking out somewhere different.  As far as hunting legendaries, it was pretty lackluster compared to Whitesprings.  I think it's because whitesprings and fissure prime are much more open.  Having to wander through buildings is not ideal.  However, that area has a ton of diverse plant life that's easy to see, which whitesprings (if you need flourescent, that's your spot) and fissure prime do not.  (fissure prime has all kinds of plants, but they can be hard to see from a distance with the tall grass and gullies.)  I was able to put on Green Thumb and gather a bunch of various flux to stabilize.  The chem station is right there, too.  Thanks for that.  I got more than enough crimson flux to make shielded enclave underarmor and a bunch of ultracite ammo for the next scorched earth event.
---
I have refrained from buying it from the Atom shop for this very reason.  Maybe one day they'll add a helmet-less version.
---
I was wondering about that.. Painstakingly power up a plant and the processor was empty which seemed odd. 
---
I, too, dislike the food/water management aspect of the game.  I mean, I get why its in there and I bought the game knowing it was in there, but I still find it to be very tedious.  I'd be far happier without it and at least a little happier if i didn't have to spend perks on reducing the amount of thought i need to put into that part of the game.  I'm also pretty low level, so maybe it gets better later on?
---
I never knew how long they took cause I never really used a workshop with one. But one time I was walking through a workshop and saw a fusion core generator and I saw one in there so I took it. And then the two level 20s that owned it just gave me puppy eyes and I felt bad so I dropped it back. Looking back knowing each takes an hour I’m happy I wasn’t a douche 
---
Yes, but check that it’s coming up white and not red, it shouldn’t attack you then.
---
Ant that for sure. Just ask several YouTubers. 
---
I think they nerfed that corpse outside of Vault 76. My camp is right next to it and I can't put anything on that body. 
---
What if I told you nearly every enemy spawns some kind of food and you can gather water from like, any single water source in the game.
---
Also, a Super Duper (Luck Perk) proc while Chemist is equipped will yield 8 Diluted Stimpacks.
---
How many times can I up vote this? How do people not understand that if they weren't being one shotted with TSE, it would just be something else?
---
Weightless, chameleon, or vanguards would be good. 
---
it'd be boring if you automatically got something amazing every time
---
Also the church near the mothman museum has a bunch that refreshes too. 
---
Your Comment Is just totally Idiotic. If you actually paid attention, Bethesda has already said all DLCs for this game will be free. Here is a source to prove you wrong as you will probably come up with a stupid point to counter as you did to the person above you.

I've had a couple two shot items drop but I've also got 5 lvl 50-80 toons. I've got a two shot, +10% damage, +1 perception black powder pistol, a two shot auto grenade launcher and a couple other two shots that were low level. 
---
Whats funny is I keep finding heavy guns on my pistol character and pistols on my heavy gunner. I've gotten 4 nice legendary black powder pistols on my heavy.
---
Yah good idea
---
Deathclaw nests, 2-3 Wendigo's , prize bot and miss nanny also spawn on these locations for me
---
It also needs a "how dare you accidentally shoot me in the arm while I'm trying to kill enemies, now you die!" emote
---
That’s really sad I’m willing to pay real money for it but that’s not allowed I think?

Thats what I mean, no higher rank is showing up. I can make max BoS, Enclave and Vault but the others (raider, casual and marine) just arent appearing at all. I’ll
---
You've run into random encounters with 100 hours. Sometimes it's just bad guys/gals wanting to kill you.
---
Sure if those are ridiculously overpowered as the TSE.    But alas, they are not.
---
1-Shotting a Scorched Beast?   The highest end game normal mob in the game? (excluding bosses)
---
If this was not the case, there would not be the extreme amount of duping TSE.
---
Your extreme exaggeration of the issue has no merit.
---
I get the shit looking,1star wood armour bits.
---
Yeah man! I can't believe you're not nice to strangers online in a game about post apocalyptic survival where the vast majority in a real setting would ABSOLUTELY be murdering each other at every opportunity for supplies!! 
---
What a dick! 
---
Thanks for the replies folks :)
---
Thats what I mean, no higher rank is showing up. I can make max BoS, Enclave and Vault but the others (raider, casual and marine) just arent appearing at all. I’ll keep looking I guess
---
I've never seen one that *didn't* attack me, and I never shoot first at them.
---
I like to go to the first overseer's camp and craft low level scoped hunting rifles and modded ballbats for new peeps. Stuff like that that they're not even going to be able to make for themselves for 10-15 levels is life-changing in the game for them, but still lets them play buy themselves and level up without hand-holding.
---
They should put it back to one every 20m, still slower than server hopping for cores 
---
Honestly I don't bother with the stacked damage for the pipe rifle, its all about the repair cost/ cost of ammo. I trade alot for nuke cards, and never had any issue requesting players .38 ammo, since we would all outgrow it\*
---
 You overestimate my intentions of killing things, I let the herd of sweaty chumps do that for me, with some minor exceptions. 
---
Nah im fine with the eating, drinking, and condition as they are right now. Never carry more than 3 purifieds and a few bits to eat and get along fine. I only have 3 Endurance, don't plan on taking it any higher. 1 Dromedary, 1 SlowMetabolism and 1 Rejuvenated.
---
My guns (mostly different rifles) don't wear down much at all and it actually makes sense to have to regularly maintain armor that is in heavy use. 
---
This is kinda what i want from a survival game like this. Then again, this is just my experience. 
---
I feel like the only player playing without mutations. I got Talons which as a gun build was useless and Herd Mentality which was equally useless because I play solo. Healing Factor seems to be one I could use, but my price for serums from Enclave is 4600 caps. How are you guys buying serums for 300 caps?
---
I just pvp quite a bit and have never had any armor break, and people love to throw grenade and use TSE you would think that would do the job. Maybe it’s my high luck? Idk.
---
But it's MEAN. and UNFAIR. 
---
I've perked my character to maximize my TSE because it's amazing and I enjoy games without bullet sponges. 
---
I ran into the super mutant shop guy yesterday and I can’t quote him exactly but he straight up said “none of this is real, it’s a dream,or a memory. Or a memory of a dream” and then he says ow his head hurt
---
Thanks for all the advices !
---
It took me a while and I got a vampiric explosive cryolator from the sbq but the crystals are a major pain. I ended up getting a two shot explosive gauss rifle 15 levels after that so I think that’s the extent to my luck
---
I would flag them saying I don’t want to see this content. Then when asked why, say I dislike the video and don’t want to see X’s channel. 
---
Try this + adrenaline perk = tons of damage 
---
There's the "Fancy Bed" you can get from the Whitesprings shopping area, but it doesn't have sheets or a pillow. Just a fancy bed frame and a bare mattress. "Vault Tec Bed 2" I think is the only one with sheets.
---
Hmm maybe I'll test out that explosive cryolater I got 
---
How is it a stupid reply??
---
Bethesda said that all dlc for ESO would be included in there subscription but then the latest one is an extra charge....
---
Love how fanboi's ignore facts and think that because its in some random article that it stops Bethesda from changing there mind.
---
I could link you 100 articles but a quick search for yourself would show you that. Link what you want, Bethesda lied about there sub model for ESO, why would you assume Fallout would be any different?
---
So to survive a nuclear blast just wrap myself in tp. Got it
---
Other then the fact that it’s against the user agreement and all those people will get banned....
---
Definitely works for applying one mod to both arms or legs. I have not tried attaching one chest mod to several different PA chests, though theoretically it should work as long as you don’t close the crafting window after attahing the mod to the first chestpiece.
---
This literally has nothing to do with what I said. 
---
Ah I see.  Marine is one of the harder ones to show up.
---
I have seen some of the raider underarmor ones at the train stations up north.   I assume these are for the Harness Underarmor or something.
---
When i look up too quickly lol
---
I figured that once you play on a modded server, that character is stuck to only play on that server. I would hope at least because that would cause major issues. Maybe they'll let you make a copy of your main character to a mod server or something. Hard to tell but I can see why they're stating it won't be until late this year since there's a lot of stuff that they would have to work out with making it happen.
---
I enjoy mindlessly clubbing the glowing horses with a bat. There is something hilarious about a bunch of people in power armor beating down hordes of glowing zombies with clubs.
---
This is amazing.
---
Oh look another crybaby who prob came from youtube
---
I mean they made enough money to buy the game 12 times over at this point and this goes on in almost all games cs:go, diablo, eso, just to name a few. 
---
I get plenty of cores just running events in power armor.
---
We killed my first queen. I soloed the silo. :)
---
Have ultricite with both calibrated legs trageting helmet and have plans for Kinectic and reative torso of cours the best shit in the game takes grinding 
---
Looks good!
---
The problem is they have to fix a bunch of balance issues to have a real pvp mode 
---
And here to brake it to you it was not bathesda with eso it was zenimax 
---
I have the whole workbench and stash area open for my camp so if people need to use it they can 
---
Sounds like similar trapping.  I was carrying lots of bundled scrap and lots of screws as my stash was full.  I think I just avoided a bit of aggregation.  I did think it was clever using that room as bait for maybe mid level looking for a kill.  Thanks for sharing.
---
Can you explain "to force the respawns"?
---
Whoa whoa whoa hold the phone
---
You can *stack* mutations?! I thought you could only have one at a time!
---
Do you have rank 5 gunsmith? Because that's pretty necessary. Also if it's modded poorly that can really eat away its durability per shot. There are substantially better guns for nuke zones, if I were you I'd just make a new toon for heavy weapons and transfer it over. Even if you never get around to leveling that toon, at least you'll know you've got an OP and awesome weapon waiting for you.
---
If a simulation from pre-war era, then all Fallouts would have to be so. No?
---
The similarities in this setting to other settings in the franchise are too similar. 
---
Take mutated creatures found throughout the franchise like giant mole rats, various insects, Brahmin, and mirelurk queens. For a simulation to predict those creatures - an accident of random radioactivity-induced mutations - would be nothing short of prophetic.
---
The same of other exclusively post-war things that would be nigh impossible to predict like the Brotherhood of Steel. While Maxson defected prior to the bombs dropping, the organization was formed sometime after the world ended. And is present in both 76 and all other fallout games.
---
If it is a pre-war simulation, but other settings aren't, then it requires an improbable amount of coincidence. 
---
TSE prevent this game from being frustrating, since everything is a god damn bullet sponge. Before I got my TSE Handmade, I was walking around with an auto grenade launcher and a back up regular grenade launcher. If it didn’t take dozens of clips to kill one enemy, then people wouldn’t feel compelled to use TSE. 
---
Equipping the Nuka-Girl suit un-equips my marine undies. That's not just a cosmetic problem; it means in order to get the benefit of the 1200-Atom item I've purchased, I have to lose the stats for my undies.
---
I also wish that the Nuka-Girl suit's helmet counted as a mask; that would at least be a partial offset to the cosmetic problem, but as is, it's another reason why I can't routinely adventure in the Nuka-Girl suit.
---
knowledge is power
---
I find it hard to believe this has anything to do with that mod.
---
I didn't suggest anything, are you sure you're replying to the correct comment? I just said the duping issue makes it easier for griefers to acquire these weapons.
---
I have absolutely no problem with them being used in PvE, in fact it makes my life much easier having TSE players farming nuke zones alongside me. I desperately need a TSE shotgun on my shotgun character. Using my explosive (non-TS) LMG is the most fun I've had in the game so far.
---
My personal problem with them is mainly the way griefers act with them, using their insane power to bully low and high level players alike. They just need some consistent damage scaling in PvP, I'm quite happy with where they sit at the moment against the AI.
---
The other reddit subs where people are selling mods, weapons and such. 
---
Scorchbeast Queens can drop actual recipes to make your own mutation serums, so peeps are making them and reselling for caps on the subs.
---
Nuke white springs, and get a high lvl friends that can help u. 
---
I agree food and drink consumption needs to be altered to drain slower. Humans do not need to eat everyday. Drink a lot of water, yes. 
---
Also, Long Johns and Road Leathers are raider under armors, as well.
---
So far, they are just living of the work of better people from Julian Lefay to Tim Cain, decades stealing their work, it is kind of sad to watch. I actually pity Todd, I know the guy must be really rich but it must be sad to look in the mirror and to know you are such creatively bankrupt designer and such a hack, a successful hack, but money isn't everything and you can't fool your own conscience with lavish undeserved praise.
---
The scorched on Fallout 76 and the Institute on Fallout 4 are what happen when Bethesda tries to make new factions, really sad to see. It is really funny those people shilling for Bethesda, defending Bethesda retconning. They are being duped by little Todd and they don't even know it.
---
"Oh this isn't important..." or "Because there is no lore about BoS being out of California, it doesn't mean they weren't." ... such bullshit.
---
Guess what, John Gonzalez, Avellone and Sawyer took lore seriously and resuscitated the old Van Buren design docs and, guess what, created the most interesting conflicts between factions on the Fallout lore since Fallout 1 and 2 that is actually extremely thematic for the Fallout universe , this is what happens when you take lore seriously and actually dedicate yourself to add some artistic merit to your work.
---
What Todd did all this time with the Fallout lore? Fucking nothing, just living of other people work.
---
Those people are just excusing Todd into his pattern of resurrecting ghosts to see if he can squeeze some last milk from them, he is that desperate. Just raping a corpse to see if he can bring it back to life one last time.
---
Well, at least worked for Todd, he is filthy rich, that is the only thing people like him seems to care anyway. Bethesda is the prime example of why I'm against intellectual property.
---
I like helping people irl so I do it in game. Sometimes those same people stumble on you and give you a hand later. 
---
You do realize this is a subreddit for Fallout 76 correct? We aren't talking about ESO. And to contradict to your point, Zenimax is runnong the studios on ESO, not Bethesda. 
---
Took a quick look at the wikipedia article about the Dichotomy and it was a pretty good read, ty. Will have to delve more later. 
---
Well I just keep the weapon, I'm main shotgun with a quad-combat shotgun, that shit is insane. 
---
I might try to take the perks for heavy weapon soon, I'm 7x so I don't have much else to take now.
---
Yes I've rank 5gunsmith, and weaponsmith Max and makeshift too. But thing is you can rarely stop during a fight to repair, and when you can't it means your weapon is suddenly a 20-30pounds dead weight.
---
That sucks.
---
It’s a good way to start, plus they kinda already do it that way, since you can only have one chem effect active.
---
There are two rando events in that area.  That's where the witch costume plans spawn.  Scout armor plans too.  
---
I’m level 3 so I should get there in no time. 
---
Probably rolling restarts for new server side changes to go into effect.  You’d only have to do a full maintenance mode when a shared and critical resource like a database changes. 
---
1k? dude they would easily charge 10k
---
I guess I didn’t realize that. 
---
If players are really doing it out of the kindness of their hearts, why aren’t they handing over the good stuff?
---
No problem. It was a decent learning experience to say the least lol. I can tell you that it was worth the price of admission, as I now store all my junk if I'm going after a bounty, or even when I meet someone to buy a gun off em with caps. Just not worth the rage aha
---
No...
---
Yeah, but the rest of the game clearly states we're human
---
Gatling plasmas cost me 1.8 lbs of weight.
---
Wish I still had the link, but I saw a build where a guy used various perks to run nuke zones without PA or hazmat. Not sure where his damage output was at, but I like knowing there are more options available if you're creative. 
---
🤔
---
fast travel to the damn there, and turn toward Watoga.  Should be an event right up the road from you.  Take a left as you go up the road, and pass the second truck and there's another one.  
---
That's true. That would encourage people to make a second or third character - if there were different story branches. If we made a choice if who to join (Enclave / BoS / etc.) and then the bulk of the other branches are closed instead.
---
These weapons shouldn't even be in the game, but oh well, when a grotesque design flaw gives players power they will defend it while it's killing the game around them.
---
I think I was there.  Everyone was way too interested in killing all the trash and didn't focus on the queen at all.  Dudes were running around looting and not killing anything.  It was a mess.  I burned through 500 rounds of .45 trying to take her out, only killing trash that were directly aggroed on me to ramp up adrenaline perk damage.  I was trying to use area chat to remind people that she regens health several times and only the melees should be worrying about crowd control when she's in the air.  I feel like half the time I'm trying to talk, no one can hear me.  I always make sure I have passive mode enabled and area chat on when the countdown starts, so that's not the issue.
---
Won’t they all be shocked when all the duped items are removed and everyone who duped gets banned etc..
---
Made by Zenimax and Published by Bethesda
---
Wow, I didn’t think of that. I’ll have to keep that in mind when wandering the wastes. Thanks. 
---
Still working fine in PC
---
Ugh I probably replied to the wrong comment, I'm still fairly new to Reddit. Yeah they don't bother me either, although the griefing system itself is what's broke. Pacifism mode should prevent all damage done to your camp too. 
---
Players will always find a way to abuse it. At least TSE also gives people a chance to fight back.
---
Good question. Never thought i would accidentally come into this position, where i forget to change my perk loadout and there it happened. Fully my own fault. But as others say. 300 caps for a mutation? Well then count me in. Where do i subscribe?
---
I'm on PS4 and it either blue screens and closes or it disconnects from server back to home screen. It has done this since the beginning. I've been lucky though and haven't lost any items like some people have claimed.
---
Okay! I’ll remember that, thanks. 
---
I get 11 from the mayor's safe - i wonder if it varies with your luck stat?
---
And they had all those colored power armor ffs
---
Agreed, they should have locked vendor inventory to character not server to defeat server hopping breaking the speed of item acquisition 
---
I just accept the fact that I'm dying of hunger until my ap is at 50% lol... Then i kill radstags or molemem. Rest of the food comes from exploring.
---
I agree.  I just think perhaps when buying ATOMs with real money, you should get more of them.   I don't buy ATOMs because I get enough for what I want.   
---
But if say.. Someone had 0 ATOMS and chose to buy 2000 Atoms for a bundle.   Then they can argue that the bundle is not worth 20 bucks.   I think the prices are a bit high to encourage more playtime though IMO.    So perhaps they envisioned more a hybrid mode, you collect 1500 ATOMS on your own and allow you to fork over 5 bucks to get the remaining.
---
Grafting vendors can have them 
---
That would surprise me but they shouldn’t punish people who have never duped like me. I try to stay away from that stuff. In the fallout market here on reddit tho sometime u have no way of knowing if something is duped or not
---
Having different ranks allows you flexibility later to swap in things like green thumb or butchers bounty without losing all of your damage cards.
---
This is the way to do it.. you need probability on your side. 
---
I got all of them and just used radaway to cure 1 at a time. eventually i lost all the ones i didn't want and lost a few i didn't really care if i had or not. 
---
Only took an hour or two. It's kinda fun if you treat it like gambling 
---
I started learning of these random encounter things from my camp, my back yard always has a tent and a corpse or an old safe or a box... I hope to find an active nuke sitting back in my garden one day next.
---
Take over unclaimed Public Workbenches and defend them at least once. You usually get good chems as part of both rewards. Will cost you a few caps though. Also, have you tried making Healing Salve? It's pretty easy and they restore 25% health. I used to rely on it a lot.
---
You could try deleting the like 2 or 4 GB reserved space that xbox has in your saves file. DO NOT DELETE YOUR SAVE DATA. The reserve space reads as such "Reserved Space." I had some luck deleting that when I was having issues with the whole power armor bug freakshow thing.
---
If you're on xbox, I sell all mutation serums for 250 each. Let me know 
---
Yeah this isn't really something new. Lots of companies show off stuff during E3 or previews that aren't in the final game itself, like Mafia 3 or Spongebob: Battle for Bikini Bottom (just to list 2 examples)
---
I see a lot of low levels going where they're not ready for trying to ride on the coattails of others, then complaining they're not getting to tag enemies too?  Stop trying to be a leech and learn to play.  Not all TSEs are duped and I don't even have a TSE - but I do have an issue with low levels trying to cheat their way through the game (tagging for easy XP in areas you don't belong makes you as bad as a duper, its still cheating/cheesing!).
---
Nothing special, but it would be neat if nukes anywhere spawned a lot of enemies like at prime or Whitesprings with singe locations having unique enemies. Nuka enemies like from the Nuka World DLC from FO4 for example. Perhaps several behemoths if you nuke West Tek. 
---
We should nuke deathclaw island, fuck that guy  
---
I've seen it spawn in the world too. I saw one by top of the world. Umm, at the end along the 'market' road (which has a lot of plan spawn spots), the road that has the raider arena with the PA spawn, theres 3 cabins facing a eating area. In the cabin on the right by the truck, in the first room on the right there is a weapon bench with a ammo box next to it. In the corner of that room there is a plan/mod spawn spot. I've seen the laser gun plan there 2 or three times.
---
That whole area is filled with possible spawn points and the safes are excellent for plans too. Server hopping and doing a run for plans can get you a lot of plans.
---
Set up your camp in the homestead field that’s just south of Vault 76. That homestead has multiple low level scorchers that carry that ammo. Plus the lumber yard across the street also has an ammo box and short hunting rifle that spawns on the second level. Easy place to farm that ammo.
---
As someone who has played every CoD game since 2007 and played my fair bit of Fortnite, Fallout 76 does not remind me of those games at all. Try again.
---
Came from youtube....wtf does that even mean?
---
Crybaby..no I'm happpy with the game, yeah its a buggy piece of crap sometimes but its fallout online so I'm good!,
---
What I don't appreciate is Bethesda treating paying customers the way they are and going back on there promise of better communication.
---
But i guess the majority of this sub is happy with Bethesda then hey ;)
---
You probably have seen random encounters, not all of them will be so... interactive though. Sometimes it's just random containers with random loot
---
The vindictive side of me likes this, haha...but realistically the time for Bethesda to have done this was in alpha or beta. Past release, it’s too late, and past the time it’s duped as the all-time most popular effect? Way too late. They *should* have done this prior to release, it was common knowledge explosive was broken in FO4 but evidently they don’t even know something that well known about their own game.
---
Criticism on Beth aside, we gotta deal with it now. Two shot is almost balanced already with the innate penalties is has, maybe if it also consumed ammo twice as fast we could call it good. Explosive...well I’ve already commented elsewhere in this thread my idea for that, but yeah it needs to be taken down several pegs.
---
It'll happen sooner or later! There's one just a kilometer or so south of my own camp that I check on pretty regularly and I've seen all manner of things there. 
---
I found the satellite once, that was really nice.
---
No you don’t know if it’s duped or not that’s why I won’t buy anything until they fix it 
---
They can turn up anywhere. The first one I saw was in the far north-east of the map when I was around Level 7. Not seen one there since.
---
Lucky Break only affects armor. If a perk references armor but doesn’t explicitly state power armor, then it won’t (or shouldn’t) affect power armor.
---
So.... you're a ghoul?
---
I've invested a great deal of time into the game and not once has me or any of my friends gone online to trade for stuff. 
---
I don't care for a player driven market at all. If that's your thing, by all means have at it, but you can't get upset that someone else's play style ruins yours. Duping is game breaking, sure, but it goes beyond TSE weapons. 
---
Almost never.  Running OG Xbox 
---
Don't mess with those at too low a level if it goes aggro on you- you can't kill it and it will break all your armor as you try to run from it, and then just kill you anyways with the poison gas if you manage to get under cover from the sonic attack. 
---
Just server hop and ditch it. Not worth the repair and stimpack bill until you can compete.
---
I understand when you say the game has rules, but slow the bar depletion on food down a bit. I chug a lot of water in game and irl but food isnt that much of a necessity. Not like the games rules make it out to be. A slight tweak should be good. Nothing major like 50% lol maybe like 2% or 5% if we are being generous
---
Why is animation considered a bug?  Seems like a trade off for not taking damage. 
---
that and there should be a way for people to "forgive" a bounty... I mean, if you're helping them and accidentally damage their stuff, Why should they get punished?
---
I just hope I pick the right wire, I like my two story and garage, and my little garden and windmills overlooking the Whitespring.
---
Now I REALLY wish we had a way of selling blueprints for house designs and stuff, so we can share some very beautifully built homes, mine is quite scenic with wood floors and all
---
There is one big floating rock that I built my camp by, due north of Whitespring.
---
I usually have like 100 super stims from killing the queen, haven’t wanted for stims in a while.
---
What about the Christmas decorations in Whitesprings?
---
Depends on the situation
---
Want the best Damage Resistance in the game? Use T-51
---
Want armor that's cheap to repair and a jack-of-all-trades? Use T-60
---
Want to carry more stuff and you're not gonna be focused on combat alot? Use Excavator
---
Going off to high radiation areas like Nuke Zones? Use X-01 or Ultracite
---
Carry on my wayward son
---
Bethesda doesn't even take care of it anymore, Zenimax does. Before you start an argument, look what forum you are actually on.
---
Not when its bugged out because of the  **Cannot remove item: part of the structure would not be accessible.**
---
A known, and very annoying issue.
---
Did you mean to reply to another thread? This is egregiously off topic
---
Run across that twice in the same location but weeks apart.  Nice amount of scrap from it too.
---
I think it groups together players in close proximity. It's incredibly rare for me to hear an American account (UK here) and I pretty much only hear British accents. Not a time zone thing either because I tend to play quite late in the evening.
---
I had vaguely considered that but assumed it was a side affect of duplicate perks, but you can confirm that that is intentional?
---
700 is a not a lot. Could easily pick that up doing 1 days worth of scrapping 
---
I have nothing helpful to say, I'm sorry, but I do love the sentence "I talk about the Stash." It speaks to me, and I do hope your problem can be fixed!
---
&gt; Game is most fun when you are low level with crappy weapons trying to kill a high level mob.
---
While I am not a low level anymore (86), I do enjoy playing without god mode guns. Mine are  all currently crafted ones, save for the Quad handmade I have (just quadruple ammo in mag).  It feels more of like an accomplishment. I haven't gotten any TSE's yet, but I know in Fo4, once I got *Spray n Pray* smg, I didn't play with much of anything else b/c it would shred people so quickly. I got bored of that play style where npcs would offer little in the way of difficulty, at that point it really isn't a *game*. 
---
Can you drink cranberry relish xp/ap drink with carnivore?
---
&gt; I just hope I pick the right wire
---
_Is_ there a right wire? Every person I've seen report this has said it's blown up. No reports of what happens if it doesn't.
---
Cool, thanks
---
It might be a food tho idk i have to check
---
Maybe I can finally get all those damn gems.
---
Events yeild so many every time... 5 or 6 each one.. Got me to 100 syims real quick. 
---
Level 29 here. The grind is how I have met awesome people who have made my grind better. I like this game! I actually have friends on ps4 now! Lol
---
Once I had a scorchbeast and mothman spawn on me at the same time near the Charleston FD on my way to Riverside Manor.  That was a hell of a battle for a level 50-ish.  The mothman is one of the cooler creatures in the game.  It's too bad it's so rare.
---
I've killed two flatwoods monsters, both around Seneca Rocks, but that was the only time I ever saw a mothman.  I'm level 107 or so, and have been playing almost every day since the game went live, including the beta hours.  They're incredibly rare.
---
I've not bothered to check but is the clock at the same time in fo4?
---
Works if you also switch view during the landing
---
I spend all my time running whitesprings and ive come across several two shots.  So its not as rare as you think.  Was most frustrating when I got  two shot fatman with nocturnal...lol
---
Slightly off topic. But why would people walk around with over 700lb of junk and not stash/sell. Not definition of a duper but very strange. Even if you have bad weight management that seem very excessive to me. As you can walk at all really
---
Go to the Mayors safe and open the box.
---
Equip Super Duper + Chemistry and get 40+ diluted stims.
---
Damn woulda have enjoyed that if i was on the server.
---
Until the hotfix for the nuke silos it was running fantastic with hardly any crashing to the XBox home. Last night I crashed twice at the end of Alpha silo and once at White Springs but was disco'd at least 3 more times. Pretty frustrating to say the least.
---
Mistress of mysteries needs to be a real woman
---
Awesome idea. I’ll have to try that when I get home
---
Was there a reason they removed them from CAMPs but left them in workshops? 
---
Where is the mayor's safe
---
Interesting but cringy
---
1) I'm in the right place 
---
2)All the YouTubers they pin wasn't wrong with what they reported on 
---
The dead body feeding thing you are refering to is Cannibal perk and unfortunetly  it does not get affected by Carnivore in any form. When you eat a corpse you get about 25% health and 10% food with or without Carnivore just the same.
---
Was tempted many times to make a post about this last night. moving more than one legendary weapon at a time, in/out of my stash is a guaranteed crash on xbox. 
---
Using like 25 points just to not use power armor: Normalizer.  It feels like most of my "perks" are just to not be hassled so much.
---
I didn't know they were craftable! I've never seen the Queen and probably never will. I'll have to hunt for someone who has Healing Factor recipe. Thanks for the help!
---
Oh yeah, there was a nice selection in the trailer &lt;.&lt;
---
Any source of them banning any dupers? 
---
I agree, the Dupers suck
---
Awesome work!  This is by far the best trading setup I’ve seen yet.
---
What does garb of mysteries dress do? I think i murdered someone wearing one.
---
Oh like crashed satellites? I saw one of those in the beta, but not really anything since.
---
Just quit ASAP before they destroy everything
---
No need for a wipe. Just remove the explosive affix from the game and all the OP goes away. TS is still really strong, but there's a line that's getting crossed between strong and detrimental to the game with explosive.
---
You got me there
---
Thank you
---
I was boring and got something practical - the clean small generator.
---
I've got quite a few thousand atoms in hand now, because there's nothing much in the store I really want.
---
Hoping they'll port over more decorative items from FO4.
---
Nope. I'm just 95 now, but started my guy in beta. I play everyday for a few hours w/o an agenda. 
---
Okay thanks!!
---
Eh it was a thinly veiled Futurama reference. It's okay though.  I just made a CSI reference in our group chat at work (the whole &lt;takes sunglasses off&gt; WHO playing kind).  no one got that either.
---
I think there would be outrage, justifiably so, if there were paid crafting ingredients and stash increases. That kind of thing is a big no no in my eyes. 
---
I've thought about getting that lamp though. You just need to put lamps in a building with power connected to the building btw, you don't need to individually connect lamps
---
In the center of Watoga, you get the quest called "Mayor For a Day".
---
The computer in the top floor of the munincipal building is the one to talk to for continuing the quest..  The safe is in that same room.
---
Wow thank you so much for the info that was exactly what I needed
---
That’s true but I don’t have that kind of patience. What I think they should do is after they fix the duping thing is come out with a bunch of better weapons like4-5* so all the duped ones essentially become worthless compared to those but the new ones won’t be duped
---
Dont use stims outside of immediate ‘I am going to die’ situations. 
---
Equip Pharma Farma 3 and actively use it always. 
---
Stimpack plan from the Enclave Medical wing uses a bloodpack for 2 stimpacks. 
---
Enjoy the game. 
---
Same thing , they wanted to celebrate christmas.
---
You are the coverboy of the Guns &amp; Bullets Magazine aiming down at the little bunny rabbit.

&gt; Once you’re finished searching just leave the building and re-enter, all the searches will be refreshed.
---
Shocking revelation!
---
If it makes you feel better, I didnt get to watch my first ever nuke that I launched hit. Did all the decoding myself, cleared the silo, key card, numbers,  picked a spot, launched. Fast travelled. Go to a vantage point. Ready to cam. 15...14...13...disconnected from server. Ohhhh the rage. It was palpable. 
---
awww.  I have Herbalist mutation so did not know.
---
Non so far but it was on one of Bethesda's things to do as well as player venders e.c.t
---
I’m level 54 on Xbox.  I really enjoy helping people out that are just starting.  I usually go to the Overseers camp and fill up the box that’s there with purified water, canned food, and ammo.   I like the idea of leaving stuff in front of white springs during a nuke run for the lower level folks.  I try to just shoot all the glowing ones w one shot and leave them for everyone else to hit too.  I was getting tired of the trolls coming in, killing everyone including me with their TSE weapons and having to spawn outside the nuke zone.
---
Oh I don’t think I’ve done any actual main quests besides the overseers one where you go to Welch. I’ve died 10s of times now!
---
It's ace. The flames throw out shadows of the grill on it too
---
I literally said he was a duper in my post, so yeah.
---
Is it weird that I have no idea what an atom is in this game?
---
Does that explain all the bugs? They are just glitches in the simulation.
---
It’s actually six. Super Duper and Chemist don’t multiply each other.
---
Combine plastic and whatever to make bulk junk which can be sold and generally weighs less
---
So.... to fit in the Fallout Lore you suggest we are in a Vault Tec Bunker within a Cryostacis Chamber induced a lucid dream like Scenario controlled by an AI?
---
I sure as hell hope so
---
They do this a lot and it’s basically baiting you in to pvp cause it’s fast caps
---
Did you ever try Tasty Wheat?
---
Your comment read like they have started and already banned people. 
---
Found the duper.
---
I've yet to see crashed satellites
---
All the synths thought they were human though.
---
What was it? I found a nurse's hat belonging to someone/thing called 'Forest'. I thought it must mean something but the nurse in Cuckoo was Ratchet.
---
Happens to me too. I just had to restart my xbox and it was good after that. 
---
The naming conventions are so jacked up - keep track of what you craft- there are further upgrades you can buy that give better protection still.
---
Lots of great tips in this thread. Thanks everyone. 
---
Outside of number 1, of which you gave no context (told by whom), nothing here really supports the theory. It is consistent with it, but that's not support. 
---
Be careful when you decide to peddle fan theories, they essentially destroy or reinvent what a large team of people worked very hard to establish. It's basically mean-spirited if wrong (and I think it is wrong in this case).
---
The animation isn't a bug. But the fact that you can do something to skip is a bug.
---
The game we have been given isn't the game we will end with, it would be hilarious if all this crap we have been doing is really just the Prologue to the actual game that will be released in a future expansion.
---
Imagine a series of smaller dlc that build up to a major expansion that sees us breaking out of the simulation and finding out we are in Post War China. The one part of Fallout so many people have been wanting to explore, I for one would love a huge twist like that.
---
...because Todd said you are a content.
---
I live in passive mode, cant count how many times its saved me when another player shows up out of the blue and I fire a shot into them instinctively 😄
---
Bait it with a bag of spoiled meat.
---
It doesn't.  It's a mini-nuke.
---
Also jumpin again would skip the animation
---
It seemed to work pretty well because he got mine. 175 doesn't hurt me whatsoever but the fact that he could do this and then shortly after, mow me down while lagging all over the place is kinda fucked up.
---
Any suggestions on a build? I want to make a tanky shotgunner at some point, just wondering if you have any specific "must have" perks to recommend?
---
Sounds like communist propaganda, but OK
---
They didn't show frozen enemies t-posing and disappearing before you could loot the bodies, so i'd say it was a greatest hits reel and not anything close to the check their ass could actually cash.
---
1) not all 2) as a player we see further than our character does
---
I would like to think it is. There are certain perk cards that require only one (chemist, green thumb, ect). Once you get it you aren't able to pick them like regular perk cards. 
---
Perk packs wouldn't apply to this.
---
Agreed 
---
Oh Todd, you've done it again.
---
Where do you go to find all these 3 star legendaries?
---
Set up 2 or 3 purifiers at your base and you'll be drowning in water, food is a bit more of a pain but usually I'll kill enough animals while playing that it's never really an issue.
---
Tbh as far as survival games go the food and drink meters seem fine to me, it's more weapon condition that's the frustrating part for me. 
---
Sorry my fault i meant they are going too
---
I actually got an explosive combat shotgun the proper way. The dupers make me so mad, since everyone assumes i'm probably a cheater
---
BTW. Do power armor parts go to inventory, if you scrap Power armor frame with active parts in in. It seems that this is not the case?
---
If you could stash your power armor Chassis as decorative pieces in you C.A.M.P without weight would be cool.
---
Burst from what? I lost the train of conversation. Are you talking pvp?
---
I dont have the perks yet ;( shotguns weight .86 approximately
---
The only ones that truely know the answer to this question is Bethesda, the douche bag did it because they can. Its encouraged almost by the mechanics of the game. 
---
&gt;(6) All humans in our environment are dead or gone. We emerge at one singular finite point at the same time. We never discover the Overseer, and receive all information through electronic means and sensory input. We have one specific goal.
---
Add to that : &gt;!If you launch a nuke at a non-fissure site, the Overseer will magically materialize a holotape at the entrance of the missile silo. She wasn't there when you went in but then how would she know what you did, put the holotape in place and disappear within seconds?!&lt;
---
I bought the suit expecting the helmet to be removable. It was a sad day. I never use it. 
---
I am 100% sure i bought legs from grahm, becouse it cost all my money when i was lowbie and it was useless for me, becouse balistic material needed.
---
As a shotgunner? Anywhere with scorched ... molemen if you're willing to melee them. Scroched drop shotgun ammo so killing them = profit 9/10 times. Not so much with molemen unless your meleeing them for ammo. 
---
Tagging u/LoneVaultWanderer and u/LadyDevann for their thoughts as community members and players.
---
An explosive shotgun or explosive heavy gun. And yes PVP. Players die as fast as mobs do to those guns.
---
In regards to your comments about vaults opening and repopulating and what not. One small detail I noticed they did that hints at a possible bright future, is in (2018) the vaults opened for us players in 2102. When New Years happened, Bethesda wished us a happy 2103. So as the years or time pass in real life, they are also passing in game.
---
Man fuck it, I spent like 20 hours server hopping for x-01 calibrated shocks. If it weren't for other people posting proof that it exists I'd call bullshit. I gave up on em, you win bethesda, I'll just use my ugly ass excavator set.
---
I am not sure but you gave me something to test so thank you very much for sharing brother!
---
It does change your stats on  the Stats &gt; Specials screen.
---
Modded stats do not affect perk cards.
---
Healing factor and marsupial are as life changing and maybe game-breaking as any two-shot explosive weapon. You just can't go back once you've got them.
---
On PC the situation is as bad as everywhere else. I bet even worsening than on consoles... 
---
1 CTD or loading screen/game freeze per hour minimum. This is getting pathetic. 
---
I just farm corn and tatos. Corn soup is good for hunger and thirst, and you can sell the tatos....
---
And for whatever reason my guns don’t break all that often 
---
How do you mule? Do you trade through friends? Or is there a trick to getting back to the same server after dumping into a container?
---
Wow, what are you charging for just a jetpack?
---
Love the idea of workshops having an “open PvP zone” around them. This should come with a warning to players approaching though. Also...this needs to also come with a revision of *how* it tags players for PvP. No more tagging the workbench, then fast traveling across the map to assassinate the current owner.
---
noob question but wtf does TSE stand for? 
---
I drop my stuff in the first overseers cache.
---
9 times out of 10 it’s gone later. No idea if it just despawns or if some lucky soul got it. 
---
Yea we are geting to 300caps per serum
---
I think this type of story would honestly only be cool if the simulation was a physical environment ( like an artificial dimension or something ) so that could allow them to make an expansion where they add the real world, but would also allow you to go back to this one, and all stats, equipment, etc would carry between
---
the explosion is about the size of a car exploding 
---
Yeah it sucks ass. On one hand, I'm losing out on materials that I could definitely use (30 wood, 30 steel at a time at the very least), and on the other, I'm losing out on 100+ caps every time it happens. 
---
That's awesome! I didn't notice that! Thanks for pointing that out. 
---
yeah sounds like you were just really unlucky. If I were that level when it happened, I'd have ignored it too.
---
&gt; lets face it, you don't even loot that
---
Yes, I did, actually.
---
I just wish they got rid of this stupid animation or at least an option to toggle it.
---
I never did find it despite looking through--what I thought were--all the side mining areas (on both sides of the tunnel). I just bypassed the doors, though, and hopped up there.
---
PRAISE ATOM IT IS THE TRUTH. EMBRACE DIVISION.
---
Yes you can any sweet based recipe still feed you even with carnivore 
---
came here with the same question lol.
---
Speaking as a YouTuber who loves the game, yes, it is annoying. But most of the time you can click on the three dots under the video and select 'Not interested'. The vid then disappears and I think it trains the algorithm not to select them for you in future, or at least give you a break for a while.
---
I've unfollowed four YouTubers I used to watch regularly because of their FO4 coverage. Either for being clickbaity arseholes, or being cowards who seemed terrified of going 'against the grain'.
---
The game not running properly, or if at all.
---
A “thank you” emote would be neat too
---
Thank a lot 
---
However you can get dupes of single star cards, which just disappear into oblivion. I had green thumb, a perk pack gave my another. My perk list shows only 1 card.
---
What if the Simulation isnt being run by Vault-Tec but by the Enclave, stand to reason that if its run by the Enclave then they would be able to alter the simulation post war to include BOS.
---
the caps that they are selling are IN THE GAME. doesn't matter that the transfer of actual cash didn't happen in the game. The moment they give caps to someone that paid them outside of the game for those caps, they're breaking ToS and Bethesda is within their right to ban them. Next you'll tell me you defend selling duped legendaries on Ebay.
---
Or open pip boy during the fall
---
They need to make blast zones more interesting and useful for loot for sure.
---
I’m blindly assuming this thread is just super duper. 
---
The landing is awesome 
---
Thank you for the effort!
---
When did I say that?
---
Yeah this idea is one I want the most. Right now PvP is super disappointing. And although I'm excited for whatever form it does take, I'd like it to take place in the same world and not a different ham the base game. 
---
Yeah it doesn't take long you just have to be prepared.. it's completely viable.  Probably get better stat boosts if you pay attention to what you're making opposed to munching on raw meat.
---
Holy crap.
---
That's tragic.
---
Only 'half' the fibre.
---
Poor guy. I'm welling up now...
---
But not for the marine wetsuit? 
---
Sounds normal to me. You don't want to lose caps to PvP? Then don't PvP. 
---
Nope, stack ALL the mutations!  MUAHAHAHA!
---
You can also GREATLY increase their positive effects with Stranger in Numbers for every person in your group that also has mutations, don't SHARE this card though as it is broken when shared and seems to remove all positive effects.
---
You can also greatly reduce their negatives using class freak.
---
I'd love to see the drop rates of decent loot increased on Scorchbeasts increase slightly, yes. However, they are, for the most part and IMO, the most common like, mega enemy in the game. I'm at lvl 132/133. If I take the munitions depot, and I roll a scorchbeast attack to defend, I will get 3 level 80 scorchbeasts. Therein lies the rub for me. For random, level 50 or 65 SB's (Or Sierra Bravos to our brothers and sisters in the BOS) there should be basic loot, yes. For the level 80's though, it would be nice to see a slight uptick in dropped plans/legendary weapons. Even if they're "worthless" or just crap plans, it's always exciting to see "Plan:Flobbity Flipty Floop" 99.9% of the time. The other .1% is reserved for Plan: Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip. I could kill a Super Mutant Behemoth if I hit it with the absolute MOUNTAIN of those that I've found xD. TL:DR Level 80 SB loot drop uptick yes, level 50 and 65 ehhhh.
---
It was absolutely horrible yesterday. Funny enough dude dropped a nuke and the whole server came and killed the queen, it ran smooth as can be. Before and after that it was choppy and just all around ran like shit.
---
Also, Golf course was spawning eyebots dropping lvl 1 legendaries lol.
---
And remove the super hero landing are you insane
---
Eyebots feeding information to update the simulation. Soil/air/water sample checkers scattered everywhere to feed radiation/weather information.
---
If you are in a group, have one player disconnect and then rejoin the world with the group. It will cause a fresh set of enemies to appear. Like when a player walks into an area you just cleared out (&amp; are probably still there) and all enemies just respawn all of a sudden. 
---
It is done a lot at the Whitesprings Golf Club since there are soo many ghouls in one small area. 
---
If its being run by The Enclave then adding in Post War stuff is simple, altering the entire simulation on the fly would also be possible thus explaining some of the counter lore stuff.
---
Mean Gene :(
---
Honestly, I stopped playing mid-december because I couldn't go from point A to point B without a freeze, a crash and a ton of lag.
---
Can see the new vending machines though! Wonder if they'll keep it that way or change it up..
---
After the patch I can't even load my game. Server stops responding on login.
---
I just had to read up this mutation 
---
Wonder if it actually works in PvP or if it’s useless because your player tag can still be seen 
---
I don’t know if this is a pun but ur getting this upvote anyways
---
To shreds you say?
---
Doesn't say anything specific what its for. 
---
Do events.
---
Don't be tempted to try all the weird shenanigans people list. They're a huge waste of time and pointless.
---
Do the event. Get the stimpaks. Get XP, armor, weapons, caps, and more all in one shot.
---
Dying during events has no penalty, so stash your junk and chuck your corpse at an event if necessary.
---
This, it's impressive how this sub things "youtubers" wants to hate this game when they basically blame bethesda and use this game as launch point.
---
Even big so called "haters" like YongYea or Joe are actually huge fans of Bethesda that feels betrayed by the state of the game at launch, as they should be. They don't blame the playerbase, heck they probably don't even blame the devs, and more the suits and higher ups that gives us stuff like the B.E.T.A for 2 weeks and then a release this messed up. 
---
This sub needs to chill out with people with this mentality, they're on your side.
---
Nothing about the one in the OP though he sounds douchey.
---
You can get really high stats with regular armor.  With heavy metal for example i have just under 350 DR currently with no perks increasing it.  With perks it's easily 450+.  My melee friend prefers regular armor and with perks and mutations sits at about 450 for both DR/ER.  Then you can add legendary effects gradually as you find good armor.
---
The marine armor chest actually has a fusion core in the back.  Not functional, just cosmetic, but it's neat.
---
Your tastes should not be surprising monster hunter is a successful long running series after all.
---
Its the in game currency for micro transactions. Ie for cosmetics
---
They can't do that
---
Yeah, so far I find it much easier to pick up as much steel and lead as possible and craft the ammo myself. Especially with ammosmith maxed out and in a few levels when I reach 50 Super Duper as well.
---
I wouldn't do that personally, trying to shoehorn a heavy gunner build into SPECIAL points made for a shotgunner is probably going to be suboptimal at best. Then again I like making new toons and experimenting with builds; to each their own.
---
This explains why the scorchbeast threat is never actually contained no matter how many nukes you drop on the fissure or queens you kill
---
Got my first in the form of a Zealot's Black Powder Pistol with 90% reduced weight at level 45 I think? Gave it to my pistol whipping buddy so he can have a light hand cannon.
---
TSE is broken.  Betsheda can just nerf it and it’s not a big deal anymore.
---
The mob level I feel is broken too.  You can fight mobs twice your level with normal weapons.  Mob difficulty should definitely be harder.
---
Betsheda has some ways to go to balance the game.
---
You can find armor pieces that dont interfere with the Chameleon mutation. Which, if you like to be invisible, is kinda cool. Or, if Bethesda releases like a sexy, locker room DLC you could totally peep like a champ. 
---
The powers that be should consider changing the marketing for this game. Instead of multiplayer Fallout it should be billed as co-op Fallout. Because that is how most people are playing this game. 
---
Ran into a guy yesterday in a nuke zone at The Whitespring. He hits his mic, "I'll pay tons of caps for crimson flux. I just need some so I can finish my damn underwear." I wasn't farming any specific flux so I dropped him the 4 crimson I had in my inventory, no charge. Found a bunch more a few minutes later and tracked the same guy down, dropped him another 20 something, again no charge. 
---
Or a BRB emote.. or just text chat
---
Full circle lmao.
---
I love this game, I wish there were more quests but playing with people fix that
---
also, the basic turrets are always level 4 so often times they hinder your defence rather than help since they can tag some enemies that would've otherwise ignored your base
---
It gets slightly less awesome when you have several scorchbeasts chewing off your anus 
---
I've read a post on this subreddit a while ago about someone had a bunch of treasure maps, spamclicked the treasure spot and had kind of the same thing. his character was even more unstable though, crashing the server every time he got near someone
---
I'll edit it in when I find it, it might contain something useful for you 
---
It's not just drop rates I'm looking at. But overall reward. What they drop isn't worth the resources to take them down unless you have TSE weapons (which I also addressed).
---
There are some guns that are the exception to these rumors, they were in the beginning anyway. I remember getting killed by someone's TSE during the beta being out of combat and I've heard there are TSE dragons that do something like 9k damage or more. To an early lvl player that's devistating. 
---
does high level emeny spwan there?
---
Magazines have dedicated spawn points. I mean, it's not like a plan spot that could have either a plan or a mod. I'd recommend getting the perk for helping to find them, just sk you can learn their spawn points.
---
Debating about swapping Radicool and Ghoulish but those are more fillers for functionality.
---
TSE is actually a really simple problem to solve. Make Two Shot and Explosive in the same category so there are no more TSE weapons in the game. Yeah, TSE users would be pissed that their Explosive effect just got swapped to some other random effect, but it would create balance
---
Give access to secret room in one of the Mansions, forgot the name atm
---
it acts as armour but you cant wear anything under it if you do the mistress of mystery quest its the reward at the end
---
if you want to start the quest you need to look for a corpse of a young woman these are the old members 
---
there is one in the white springs in one of the cabins in a bathroom shower
---
You're not wrong.  At the same time, detonating cars when other people are near them is a dick move.
---
My 2 shot auto laser busted from full in 2 reloads...
---
As I said to the dude who got on the offensive towards me, he was a level 20 too with a bunch of rarer type bulk so that’s why I got suspicious on top of the other things. And it is some bad weight management if he wasn’t duping lmao
---
Who goes into this game to be vendor? I have never traded with a stranger. In fact I got lucky had a significant amount of Rad X, Purified Water, and Stimpack. Know what I did with this? I went and found low level players, flagged them down, and then dropped bags with about ten of each in there for them. Then I vanished like a Patriotic Vault Boy in the wind. I also sometimes show up when I see them in higher level areas and help them out with my TSE Handmade and give them a chunk of the gear I loot. Not once have I tried to make caps off of any player, because I can sell to Whitesrpings or scrap it, or find someone who could use it. In fact I recently gave my auto grenade launcher and a bunch of ammo to random guy. It’s all imaginary money that I can’t benefit from, especially since I haven’t used caps on anything except stimpacks. If it was Atoms or something worth actual money, then yeah we can have a talk about the market place, until stop feigning outrage over nothing.
---
There are only 2 songs I like on the radio and everything else is just crap. I wish we had the option to disable some songs. 
---
This personally pisses me off.  I am a high level, almost 200.  I have a TSE shotgun and Gatling gun (that I swap between).  WHEN I'm in an event I switch to a low level exploding SMG, why, because I can tag EVERYTHING and let OTHER players kill it all as well.   
---
Uranium fever is such a great event when people ALL tag the mole miner supervisors and it only takes one DICK to ruin a great event.  I so can't stand the idiot who runs in with a TSE shotgun and proceeds to OSK (one shot kill) everything preventing others from tagging and getting loot / xp.   
---
Don't be a dick! 
---
I mean, that's not what they said, but are they wrong?
---
&gt;feel like a god for using a duped thing (lets face it, you don't even loot that)
---
How many of you **found** your TSE item?  I bought mine on the marketplace and am 99% sure it was duped. 
---
Oh I see! Like even non-workshop open PvP areas, like arenas? Imagine a new area opens up that’s an arena and the arena floor is a PvP zone? Gates at opposite sides, once some players sign up it starts an event where you can join a team or spectate. Spectators can place bets, stuff like that. Signboards light up with the winners’ name at the end of a match. Are we not entertained?!
---
no reason paper bags couldn't get a weight limit too.
---
I don't know, they need to completely rework the system
---
I read all those things too. The VSS and something about a mothman cult I’m not reading much about. 
---
Anyway, there’s a cabin by Alpha silo called Detectives or Inspectors cabin, it has a terminal with supposed info on a “ infiltration “ to the government and other stuff you touched on. When you try to read the files it says corrupted data and it alludes to the detective moving his base out of fear of being discovered. I think it ties in but I don’t know if he moved somewhere else or it’s going to be DLC content 
---
Although I agree that removing them going forward is a solution, I'm not sure if there's a way to fix them retroactively. Ya know, the whole not being able to track individual items thing. 
---
thanks everyone.
---
They should is what I’m saying
---
Maybe I was unclear.  If I see others trying to level, I'll let then tag first.  I was referring to your "if I see a hammer brother riding my coattails" comment.  Seemed like you were saying if you see someone with a hammer then you'd auto-switch to your TSE, which seems just as bad and completely contradicts the "all in this together" idea.
---
After the 1.0.3.17 patch I can't even load my game.      
---
Server stops responding and disconnects me immediately after showing my character in-game before I'm able to move or take any actions.
---
Likening this game to a multi-volume epic, the current story, ending in events related to the cranberry bog, is mostly done by many players and the next 'book' will involve one or more other vaults opening, which might make use of some 'living' human NPC's.  
---
Can't really help you, other than just grab all the shotgun perks in Strength.
---
Enforcer is the only shotgun perk I use specifically because I am not a shotgunner.  I just have a shot gun to cripple ghouls so my lower level friends can fight them easier for XP and loot.  It also works as a good tag in nuked Whitesprings with 10 + people and pacifist mode on.  If I am doing a solo WS loop, I run with my 2 shot handmade and one shot everything.  
---
They arent legendary drills, he means literally just a drill off a 3 star.
---
Pretty sure my camp spot is a mothman encounter spawn cause I've seen him there 3 times in 2 days lol, hope you find something cool!
---
They can't see your player tag. But you can't be moving, so its utility is diminished.
---
Why not?  Unpopular?
---
I don’t know what game you are playing and if you even have a sense for quality, but this game hasn’t improved a bit. 
---
They buried the game in that moment where every level 5 Character is offering you 300 different explosive 3 star guns. Where after three dupe fixes 5 minutes later a workaround video for  a new duping method is posted on reddit and YT, where PvP is defined by which Glitcher is pulling the trigger first to one shot you. 
---
Naive guys like you who defend this pile of shit of a game are the reason why publishers and devs even dare to release such a desolate game. 
---
Wake up and come back to this planet. Objectively it’s impossible to defend this pathetic messy unbalanced bug of a game. It has nothing to do with a hate train, I and thousands of other gamers are pissed for more than a reason!
---
The endgame is unrewarding and defined by dupers and glitchers, players who play fair are getting constantly griefed. Reach the endgame and then tell me and others again that this game isn’t this bad... 
---
Pathetic fanboys. 
---
I saw someone nuke the dried lake bed once and nothing spawned. I've always wanted to nuke the mire
---
You shouldn't need to risk losing mutations - just wear armor that negates the ability and your screen will stop shimmering. Or at least that's what I expected. Does it not work that way?
---
Exactly :)
---
Nothing is being taken care of right away. Are you blind? The bag thing up to 6 months with a replacement on a lie, Bug fixes that have broken the game further or didn't fix anything like the fov fix, the dupping bug is nearly the same as the one they fixed, obsidian had plenty of time? You fanboyism is showing any game needs more than 18 months to make. They was headed the assets yeah you mean like 76 and a 3 year development did you forget 76 had more than an extra year? Nearly no story not much voice acting all the quest are mind numbing clear area. If new Vegas was a fallout 3 mod 76 is a micro dlc for 4. Retcons? Obsidian didn't retcon anything they was made up of the creators of fallout stop watching oxhorn with his new vegas videos with mods changing what obsidian put in the game.
---
Bethesda outright retconing everything and actually say they don't care about changing lore of the old games. Yes I just said in my last comment if you can read I hated new vegas because of the bugs it gets a lower score for me than fallout 3 and almost 4 because of it. But it will say 76 is even more buggy. Map side and objects dknt make a game good all that empty wasted potential. I have over 300 hours in fallout 76  1000+ in fallout 3 and 4 and probably around 350 400 in new Vegas you don't know what your talking about your just a Bethesda fanboy your comment make it clear.
---
Grafton Steel has multiple extractors.  Claim it for a few hours and you will be loaded up for a good while
---
A level 103 stopped by the Overseer’s Camp last night and left my level 18 ass a bunch of plans. I’d just spent two hours battling hostile bots at White Springs and wasting ammo like an idiot, so it was a nice “fresh start” gift. 
---
Paid it forward today when I ran into a pair of level 2s. Left them some plans as well as guiding them to a supply drop I called in. 
---
Right - I've been stockpiling them for that purpose; the problem is that I'm not sure I see enough benefit to bother with them.
---
Is there a reason the first thing you thought when seeing the level 75 guy is that he was going to kill you? This game isn't exactly filled with pkers.
---
It would be labelled as a Two-Shot gun.  Two-Shot is a prefix, Explosive is a secondary affix. 
---
The two-shot thing is cool, but explosive guns are insanely powerful by themselves.  
---
I'm 100% with you. I've posted before about what a wash the munitions depot was for me to hold. I had a Two Shot Combat Rifle, and in the span of 3 hours I was besieged twice by the 3 lvl 80 SBs. Spent 600ish rounds of ammo protecting the depot, for it to return me 400. That is an issue. Would definitely be worth taking SBs out if you also got to loot things they had "eaten", i.e. ammo or armor pieces from some unlucky SOB. (You can search their poop for stuff, so that shouldn't be too much of a stretch, right?)
---
I don't want to sound like a jerk but I found the X-01 Jetpack almost immediately after finishing the Enclave quests. I then found the Bright Headlamp almost immediately after that. I had no idea that it was hard to find, I just thought not many people used it because it kills your AP.
---
Same, I'm a bit higher at level 60 but am just now reaching some of the final quests and still haven't explored a good 1/4 of the map. I hope I've timed it that I'll finish as new content drops.
---
*Your overseer has dishonored you*
---
I spoke with a chameleon melee main (vampire) who was repeating the Halloween candy event. He could 1-shot players in power armor, it was crazy. Basically it works like this, say you're fighting an invisible person whose crouched. If he's invisible to you, he gets a critical. Whether or not he's invisible to you will depend on your character's Perception stat and the amount of motion he is making.
---
Doesn’t extractors produce ore now and not scraps?
---
I would drop barbarian and take Blocker instead, flat 45% melee reduction I have found is far more useful than the extra DR/ER you get from Barbarian.  If you find you NEED it to reach that 200ish threshold to run around in just a hazmat suit I would roll with 2 points in each of the sluggers and take blocker and barbarian. 
---
Make sure you take Weapon Artisan rank 3 to swap in when you repair your melee weapons, greatly increases their damage past 100% durability.
---
Drop Moving Target and take Dodgy instead, it will amaze you how tanky this makes you, especially with lone wanderer and AP boy/girl.
---
Drop grenadier and fire in the hole, it's pretty easy to learn how to chuck nades accurately and you really don't need the AOE increase, they hit pretty wide now.  Use those points to go more deeply into END or CHAR.  If you go end get radicool (gives 1 str even at zero rads) and maybe lifegiver or iron clad.  If you go CHAR get Party Boy/Girl to make your whiskey give +6 str and 55% water or Tenderizer/Suppresor.  Might consider Stranger in Numbers if you play in groups with others rolling mutations.

After buying the western duster and hat I haven't bought anything, so I've got about 3500 I'm just sitting on as I wait for a cooler long coat or duster to get released.
---
Those would be from dailies, I assume. 
---
Gone, will be floating around in the ether will all the disappearing chem and weapon drops I have done for people that vanish..
---
I generally just farm weapons. I got to a place where a bunch of super mutants spawn, kill them and break down their weapons. It's a good source of steel and learning mods.
---
I would disagree with that because some people can get some crazy stats with unyielding.  Then they can equip every single card in the game and then some.  That would be the 98% build of the game.  No thanks.
---
Fair enough; that's an easy fix. Will cause me to change my current +sneak, armorless build. Though this may be the best option so I retain it for situations when I want it but don't have to deal with the shimmer the rest of the time.
---
Sounds like you are screwed unfortunately.  But out of curiosity, why were you manually swapping out cores? 
---
What platform ?
---
Eastern penitentiary as long as it is populated by super mutants.  Each of their pipe guns will scrap for 5 steel.  More if you have scrapper equipped 
---
I tried the Grafton steel workshop there was too many super mutants and I didn't have enough steel to get enough generators to power up the second extractor
---
I’m doing the same thing, and it’s actually more fun than the first time I played through. Running quite a few mods so it’s basically a different game. I didn’t hate 76, got to level 200 without cheating and didn’t dupe or buy items from dupers... I just got burnt out . It was my fault though, I played too much and by the time I got to end game (what little of it there is) I was just bored.
---
But god DAMN it’s nice not to have to worry about repairing armor and weapons 
---
I mean in general 
---
Where is eastern penitentiary?
---
What like disable damage maybe?  
---
Depends on the armor pieces then I guess. If you could find some really nice 3 star legendary bits, that have chameleon but also boost X or Y, then possibly. However, short of you like, two or three shotting most enemies you run into, they will know you're there, and their friends will attack.
---
I think you should have a max carry weight. Maybe 1.5 of normal. Might solve some issues.
---
After the 1.0.3.17 patch I can't even load my game. Server stops responding and disconnects immediately upon showing my character in-game prior to me being able to move or take any actions.
---
Actually it was done in response to more backlash from the Xbox players who played first, who complained that the roll was on backwards.
---
Ya sorry mate, I dont have any "duped" items and neither does my team mate. We dont have any TSE weapons, but we do have a few TS and I have an explody 44 3 star. We are both over level 100, we shouldn't have to lose our items because other people can't play ethically.
---
Nice drop! Furious is pretty good, but sadly it's effect is on a timer before it resets back to base damage so don't bother fully charging it before unloading on your enemies. 
---
As for Perks; Tank Killer, Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, Master Rifleman, Glow Sight (vs Glowing enemies), Adrenaline, Demolition Expert, Nerd Rage (at low HP), Tenderizer, Bloody Mess and the Adrenal Reaction mutation should help to deal a ton of damage not including sneak kills with it using Covert Operative perk. Though that depends on if you want to sneak kill at all.

Not seen any proof yet that people can 1 shot other players that are not engaged in PVP.  Not 1 single video showing proof.
---
Fallout 3 and New Vegas had the same issue with clocks, though there should be a 3 hour difference with FNV, that I can put down to Obsidian not updating the texture of the clock though.
---
Note however in F4 and F76 that the Wakemaster Alarm Clock and the standard Alarm Clock don't have hands.
---
Also interesting, is the Nuka-Cola clock you can build is stopped at 08:47, rather than 09:47 as it should be.
---
Unless someone shoots you with an explosive shotgun you can ignore them as it does bugger all damage. You can put passive mode on which stops you shooting other players. 
---
Is-a me, Excavatario!
---
Did you “drop” it instead of “place” it? I’ve had all kinds of disconnects and crashes with PA floating around, but I never “drop”, always “place”, and I’ve never lost one.
---
I'm on Xbox if you'd like to peruse my C.A.M.P. for inspiration ahaha
---
Marsupial plus all the perks is insane. I love it!
---
We have both
---
Fucked that reply up, MrCool90
---
fast way i found is head to blackwater mine, outside there is toxic water, gather a ton of it. head into the mine on the right there is a decon shower to use. drink the water to get rads! be sure to server hop and pay attention to when you have starches genes on 😃
---
Dno honestly it was low so i thought id just grab a fesh one lol. 
---
I wondered about that.  I keep checking but it’s never there.  Even at the moment of horror, it just disappeared from both our inventories. 
---
No, it keeps going. In Fallout 76 the date always resets to reclamation day.
---
Part of the problem is that the enemy level isn't really that indicative of their power.  A Lv. 62 Feral Ghoul is rather trivial at Lv. 40, but a Lv. 30 Mirelurk Queen isn't.  It just comes down to how they attack.  A Feral Ghoul doesn't have too many options other than running right at you, whereas a Mirelurk Queen is a walking tank.
---
I agree though that it's surprising to walk around Watoga when no one else is there and only encounter things 20 levels below you, with the odd thing that isn't.
---
TIN CANS ARE TWO STEEL EACH. 50 or so at whitespring golf course

I do HATE the look of the dress, but since I always opt for 1st person view, it's other people's problem most of the time, not mine. I have a second outfit I always wear for pics. ;)

No, you guys (statistically most of reddit) wants globalism, well this is part of it.  You don't get to claim you cannot work on something due to regional holidays.

In my experience it only happens when you alt+tab while on a loading-screen. Never happened to me on any other point in time.

I got an instigating one at level 15 and it carried me through until i was 50 I still see it in my dreams, was it real? was the 20 caps i got for it worth it?

---
It's really hard on the knees, I appreciate people who can do it, but I am not willing to hurt myself like that.
---
Its now stupid to use your best weapons to kill enemies the way youre play style wants you to kill them?
---
You guys need to stop blaming the players and blame the game on this particular issue.
---
Extra credits did a video on it too. If you want a spark notes on it
---
But then that would suggest we walk incedibly slowly and bullets travel at a snails pace, if its purely for day/night phases I'd rather not have that and that everything was in realtime as play is, so why is food, drink and weather hyper compressed time?
---
Well, now you level up to 45 and build it all again xD or, find calibrated shocks and stuff and make it epic
---
"With the right perks, TSE weapons make players into gods. It's not fun being untouchable. Reign it in. Idk how but it's gotta be done. "
---
I have maxed commando and demolition perks and as of yesterday, a \*\* furious exploding 10mm SMG. It's ludicrous as there's nothing I fear anymore except self-immolation. I blew myself up at least a dozen times on enemies that were too close or teammates running in front of me. It's not even two shot which for me is mind boggling damage.
---
The Halloween candy event is a PVP-enabled event.
---
Thanks for the info guys. I was actually really really enjoying my time on 76, put in hours of grinding for screws to build that armor and now its just gone... very nice. Fallout 76 can actually just get uninstalled  f*ck this trash 
---
Complete mayor for a day in watoga, kill all your robot brothers. Lead and steel.
---
Take note there's a mountain of mutants you have to cut through. 
---
This! People that farm for specific things usually start to run out of something else so end up on a farming loop. It’s best to do things with varied rewards, also more interesting then server hopping the same locations.
---
(Speaking from experience)
---
I’m level 70 and I’ve got zero explosive weapons. 
---
You can farm any of the low level areas that have a lot of mobs (Morgantown Railyard, Airport, High School) Grafton Dam, Eastern Pen, AVR Medical Center, DMV building.
---
If you are a higher level you can farm tin can traps which give 9 cans a piece which is 9 lead and 18 steel.  
---
Top of the world has 6 or 7 traps off the top of my head, 2-3 in the door way leading into the lodge and 3-4 hanging in the flame thrower main gate, you can jump and disarm them.
---
You can also get 6 tin can traps at Camden Park.
---
There are 4 tin can traps at Crevasse Dam.
---
There are 4-5 traps at Sunny Top Lanes.
---
Eastern Penitentiary has 4-6 traps.
---
I am sure there are others I am forgetting but those should get you off to a good start.  You can also tag steel in your junk menu and go fill in points on the map you don't have or go back through old ones grabbing and scrapping anything metal along the way.  
---
This is where I go. 
---
Yes please, my game name is Froski and the tag is Fr0ski!  I will be on around 1 in east coast time!
---
Ah, spotted the communist scum. Here in Murica, we have bypassed your inferior socialistic tendencies in favor of adapting fire superiority
---
Because if time was as real as it is here I would only see the sun on the weekends. Lol. By the time I'm done with work night has usually fallen. 
---
Where to find these tin can traps
---
Do you want Megaton? That’s how you get Megaton. 
---
And everyone with a TSE weapon should not use it so I can mooch off of you.
---
When will r/fo76 stop blaming the players for how xp is distributed and start taking Bethesda to task?
---
I would love one if you don’t mind. PSN ID is the same as my username. 
---
How about a Aid, Junk, Notes, or Ammo option?  All I’m seeing at the moment is weapons/apparel. 
---
Bos combat with ultra-light mod.
---
Did u ever figure out if this is fixable. It just happened to me
---
When you claim a workshop the workshop gives you an inventory of materials to craft things, be conscious in what you’re constructing instead of trying to build everything.
---
It’s absurd. My max carry weight is in the 200s. Anyone walking around with 700 is a moron and/or duper imo. 
---
The clock on my pip boy changes. However, the date never changes.
---
Yes please, this, loot rights from teammates and partial or full experience points.  If you have to divide it by the number of people in the group that's fine too, just anything, if everyone doesn't get to tag it's a complete loss and making sure everyone hits every little thing is well frustrating and really breaks immersion.   
---
The point of being in a team is to share.  Why aren't we sharing? 
---
Thanks for askin, I had no clue either lol. 
---
Did u ever figure out how to fix this? It just happened to me too 
---
I am going to propose to my gaming clan that this Friday will be 76 the drinking game. Every time we get a bug glitch or randomly kicked out of the game or we can't tell the difference between different stacks of power armor and pick the wrong one or any of the other numerous things that drive us crazy on a user interface level you have to take a shot. I give it an hour before we are all too sloshed to be able to do anything other than lie there in our own piss and giggle
---
I stopped calling it “fallout 76” and started calling it “you know you didn’t loot that”.
---
Agreed. They suck in general and need a buff in aiming, dps, and hp.
---
Congrats! I just got mine today too. Gonna enjoy that sweet carry capacity
---
1. The budget is not fine, i can't even decorate my house the way I want with the current budget.
---
2. not necessarily, It could be a building with no loot spawn inside.
---
3. fast travel cost is a joke. no other fallout game charged to fast travel.
---
4. what they have now is lacking, for decorators who loved decorating in fallout 4 it is extremely lacking.
---
5. yea your probably right.
---
6. perhaps
---
7. It's happening to me my main mission window is empty.
---
8. I want an indicator to where to go next or I feel like I'm wondering around aimlessly.
---
9. yep
---
10. Each Vendor should have like 400 caps every 12 hour reset.
---
11. Each vendor should have their own caps limit. it makes no sense for them to share caps. do they need to run to another vendor when they need caps? see makes no sense.
---
12. yea your probably right.
---
13. I was mainly thinking about PC. but pretty much all online games have a text chat. It feels lacking without it.
---
14. thanks
---
15. I see where this might be difficult to do, but it would be cool.
---
It has not done that for me, and I kill them every time I visit the vendors :0
---
When they increased the limit they said they would monitor it and increase it again once they knew how it effected the servers.
---
I guess waiting around weeks and maybe months for this to be looked at again is acceptable to Bethesda though :/
---
Blaming youtubers? Bethesda have years of development experience, they knew exactly what not to do and went and did it anyway. The sensible approach would have been to delay it, not rush it out.
---
Thats what I am saying, do away with it, its a weird situation...
---
It's quite absurd, yes.
---
Happened to me yesterday. Minding my own business, Level 9 (just started last week) and was followed around for 30 minutes by two dudes who kept killing me. They were the only two people I've interacted with so far, so batting a thousand with the dickheads. I'd prefer to be left alone (solo player for now) to learn the universe, story, game mechanics, build, explore, and not be executed, thank you very much.
---
Or if you're going to interact with me, just be cool about it. Not asking for you to drop anything for me or help with any quests... Just let me do my thing. 
---
I've been running Marsupial, Speed Demon, Healing Factor and Plague Walker simultaneously and I don't plan on going back to being a normy. Nope. Nope. Nope!
---
Yeah it's stupid. I bought a tse shotgun and dragon last week and it has been the most boring week I've experienced in game. I think I'll just put them in my stash and pretend they don't exist. 
---
Do away with what? I'm sorry I'm just lost now.
---
Jinx padlock for life no backs 
---
Yeah same with black bird.
---
Stash limit is OK at 600, you just have to limit yourself. Try not to keep weapons or armor in your stash cause those add up quickly and try to keep only 200 or 100 of each type of junk.
---
Oh awesome thank you!
---
That’s a bit of an assumption. I’m 20 lvls lower than him and have about 50 legit treasure maps.
---
My "Magic Boomstick" is a level 15 pump action shotgun, Instigating Explosive.  It wasn't duped.  (Seriously, if I was going to have a duped weapon, it wouldn't be level 15!)
---
This dismissive BS gets on the nerves.  Maybe YOU duped or got something you knew was duped, but that doesn't mean you get to say that the nice stuff I have is illegitimate.  Quite the contrary.
---
Someone's being a jerk, that's one thing.  To then smear anyone with anything nice is over the line so far as I'm concerned.
---
That’s not what altruism or good will means, at all.
---
Yeah, that's not how it works, chief.
---
Yeah. Looks like its gonna be a tricky situation. I guess theyd have to make a copy of your character for modded servers, it would suck if you just wanted see what modded servers were all about, and then couldnt go back
---
You can get a lot by creating new characters and playing them up through the levels.
---
This is why you don’t buy Xbox 
---
i think thats more of a customer support thing not being able to do it on a player by player basis, if the devs wanted to implement a mass change they could probably do it during a scheduled maintenance period.
---
Kind of sounds like the skirmishes that happen around the Pumpkin House.  Deathclaws, Fog Crawlers, Scorchbeasts altogether.  One wonders how the Mr. Handy running the Pumpkin House survives.
---
Honestly, Enforcer might be a little overpowered, but it gives me a fighting chance against pretty much anything with legs.  Cripple the legs and any Deathclaw is no longer an imminent threat.  Cripple the arms, and it can't do anything to stop you.
---
Same here. Didn't use build guides, I just always go for a Strength-oriented character in any RPG setting where Strength is an option. Initially made him a Shotguns/Throwing Knives build, kinda like a cowboy build but without the revolvers, using a Bowie Knife as a backup melee weapon for low-ammo situations. 
---
That lasted only until about level 10-15ish, at which point I started to notice that the shotgun would break really quickly, ran out of ammo all the time if I was too trigger-happy, and did less damage to enemies than a random unupgraded sledgehammer I picked up off a super mutant. That's also when I noticed how much harder the sledgehammer was hitting for compared to my bowie knife.
---
Now I'm a hammer bro, and it had nothing to do with build guides. Go figure.
---
Hmm I can spend caps, time and ammo travelling to / doing events orrr, I can just server hop at Watoga emergency services with pharma farmer and get 10-14 stims each time and itll take me less than an hour to get enough to last ages.
---
yeah you can keep your silly events.
---
Only credible point was 1, but beyond that it's sketchy at best. I remember reading through it.  
---
For point 2, if you know anything about Robobrains… it's pretty clear why Vincent May-Lily doesn't want to be alive.  
---
Point 6, it's indicated that the entire Appalachia has been wiped out by the Scorched. This is indicated in logs by the brotherhood where it's theorized they're in the process of an 'Extinction level event' as they put it. You can find the holotape in the room to the left after getting off the elevator. As everything is either dead, mutated, or scorched. Clearly it worked.  
---
As someone else better said  it below though. There's too many similarities with the later Fallout-verse for this to be a programmed simulation by Vault Tec. Factions, fauna, etc. would have to be entirely original for it to be a forethought.
---
PS4, XB, or PC? If on PS4 I can recommend monkeyshine39. That's who I bought mine from. 550 caps each iirc. No funny business. He has a trading post setup on the golf course.
---
the overseer would be proud of ya
---
So what do you lose by NOT one shotting every glowy ghoul in whitesprings? Do you get less xp if you let someone else or that low level toon get a few hits in for xp and loot? Do you lose loot or xp by letting other get a few shots in and exercising some restraint? 
---
Honest question because I am curious why it is such an issue? 
---
Yep farm weapons. Poseidon has a ton of low level scorched that drop guns and a lot of junk steel. I run through that with a melee weapon (I'm rifle) and collect everything, scrap and I'm good for a few days.
---
Not too sure on Bethesda's end, but a handy tip: If you're storing PA pieces for later, A: you're level 10, dont worry. Power Armor is simple to find. B: If you can, always try to store PA on a frame. (Where a chest piece weighs like 16lbs, legs 12lbs etc., all those pieces equipped/stored on a frame will only weigh 10lbs.)
---
Tranquility lane from Fallout 3, pretty much.
---
I'd be upset I wasted caps buying my tse weapons, but I'd be happy to be mortal again. 
---
I built my camp so I have a broken down bus with a couple containers within my build area. Used the small letters to write out FREE STUFF IN THE CONTAINERS
---
I put an assortment of chems, food, ammo, and extra gear I find in my daily travels.
---
Had two random people show up at the same time last night as I was getting ready to log out. They got the free stuff. Invited them inside. Used the stash and crafting stations. Then we had a jam session with the musical instruments on my porch. Perfect way to end the day.
---
Says you're offline. I just sent you a voice message. 
---
Yeah scrap all of your junk, sell or break down duplicate weapons. A lot of your space will be junk to build and improve. Pick 3-5 guns and focus on them to start.
---
Costs you five perk points to lock them down and reduce the negative side effects, but it's worth it.
---
Only because she is imbalanced and has been since beta. Everything else is a joke minus the scorch queen, which still isnt difficult.
---
Actually it is....OP lost money because he tried to fight back and lost

I hate it also. It’s annoying and unnecessary. I’m now obligated to carry water and food at all times and then if I carry it for too long it spoils.

Get Marsupial and jump up on the awning at the back door of whitesprings golf clubhouse, that way you can tag everything in safety through the windows.
---
Just checked the date on my pip-boy and its still 2102 :/

Okay. After googling ducksfoot pistol, I can say yes. That would be pretty dope, but a PITA to reload.

You are an illusion. As am I. Think about it, when we die, nothing in life matters or mattered for that matter.

Life is like a song. There is no reason for the music to play but only for the music to play.

I also considered myself a die hard fan. Played Fallout 3, new vegas, and 4 to completion. Oblivion and Skyrim.

---
The bombs never dropped, the entire world of Fallout is a simulation to see how people will act after a nuclear war.
---
thanks you are a beast.  I messaged a few people on there that said it happened to them so hopefully they know how to fix it
---
You should have just dropped them in the middle of nowhere. Instead you are like "Contributing to breaking this game further would be a great xmas present for this community!!!"
---
Its like if someone handed you a few pounds of opiates and you started handing them out to everyone you know and then god forbid someone labeled you a drug dealer. Like yeah ,you are handing out addictive substances to people, you are part of the problem whether or not you actually SOLD them and regardless of how you obtained them.
---
I already stashed mine and went back to my old rifle. 
---
100% agree. I’ve hated this mechanic since the beginning.
---
Ehh I think they cant rise to the level of hypothesis because, well, how do you falsify reality. What experiment can one create to test whether its reality or a simulation. Closest thing i heard about was how our inability to get a measurement of the really small (sub atomic) is actually us trying to measure a pixel which in the simulation is undefined so we can’t measure it 
---
Because if I don't eliminate them immediately, I run the risk of my game freezing during the fight and me dying. Won't make that mistake ever again, especially when other players just leave you for dead.
---
Besides half the time I'm fighting in a nuke zone I'm either solo or with 1-2 friends. 
---
Limit yourself...its fallout. We should be able to collect a decent amount of scrap as well as different armours and weapons and not worry about every single item we pick up making us overweight.
---
Its a shoot and loot but no room to pick up the loot at the moment :/
---
I love building. My camp is a 2 story house. 3 bath 2 bed living room, living room closet, kitchen/dining room, attached garage.  
---
House itself is 4 wide 5 long. the garage is 2x5  
---
In the garage I have my stations for crafting, a garage door that opens on a pressure plate from the inside and a keypad to get to the garage door from the outside. Upstairs hall has a pool table and 2 bedrooms. as well as a door to access the roof.  
---
It’s a level curve that just need to be adjusted if that is the case. A math recalculation. But that 9k isn’t what’s applied to a slap damage. At least it shouldn’t and if proven and replicated, reported. 
---
I've heard of farming Watoga, but I rarely get more than a stimpack or two in there (yes, I have pharma farmer). 
---
I was farming the responder bot and mothman can appear as a random encounter where he leaves or as an encounter where he attacks you. dont know what triggers him to aggro maybe its when you see him after a certain number of times but he can also stalk you he did this for 20 minutes one time when i was a low level it was scary
---
also
---
mothman has red eyes
---
wise mothman from an event has yellow eyes
---
and scorched mothman who i encountered last night in the mire has green eyes
---
I wish all scrap was bulk-able.  
---
Would really help when looking at just to be able to see what exactly I have in a flowing format.
---
I cant remember the exact wording, but I've heard Grahm ramble something about being here before but not being here? I'll see if I can find it. 
---
I logged in the other day, went ago for abit and my game froze. A few mins later I could move and everything loaded in
---
My first decent legendary was a TS cryo. My early lvl SBQ strategy was to stay low in a trench, wait until she lands and keep her frozen for the melee squad.
---
Or, unfortunately, find calibrated T-60 or X-01 shocks and just scrap it after it sits in your stash unused for 40 levels like i did.
---
Im almost level 100 and the stash capacity is not a problem. Yes, I wish it was larger so I could store more legendaries but that's because I want to horde and sell them. However, there is plenty of room for junk, armor, ammo and whatever else. What I found that really helps with keeping your stash level alright is consistently building and crafting. If that isn't your style then just learn to downsize. 
---
Similar boat, but I may be done with the game anyways. Getting stale fast
---
&gt; Damn I haven't seen any of these random encounter things and I'm like 100 hours in.
---
&gt; You've run into random encounters without realizing it
---
Where is the disconnect here?
---
So did u get everything back?
---
Fair point. Would be nice to not get duplicates of the singles

Why not have it at Vault 76? We can all fast travel to it for free. Every one has it unlocked. It can become a social hub for LFG, and helping new players. And it's safe from nukes.
---
Vault 112 already exist and I doubt Bethesda/Vault tech would pull the same shtick twice. Plus the citadel has the vault 76 marked as a control vault.
---
This would be a neat way to remake the game as needed. They could intertwine all the virtual worlds in some way. It could also be used to provide a story reason for private servers. We break out of the simulation and can control West Virginia, and allow our friends to join in.
---
This, delete any PA your hording as you ill be able to get it when you can use it, its very common.
---
Would be nice if we could learn mods of breaking it down as well like weapons and normal armour but hey ho!
---
also I had an extra physical copy due to a fuck up on amazon's part so I bought the game twice...sock it to me!!!...me love you long time bethesda!!!
---
Yes, every single thing 
---
I heard one xmas song 
---
It was either attempt to stop him or spend a fortune in repairing my base.
---
It's simple: Guy 1 attacks base; Guy 1 becomes wanted. Guy 2 tries to defend his base by attacking Guy 1; somehow Guy 1's bounty is now misteriously passed to Guy 2. 
---
You are right, this is how it works, but it is not how it is *supposed* to work. Is a known bug.
---
So u just have to let it fix itself?

I only answered to his argument 'people were mean to me so I'm mean to others'.
---
You're free to use whatever suits you as far as I'm concerned, I couldn't care less. 
---
And we DO blame the game on this issue. We ALSO ask the players to be kind, both aren't mutually exclusive.
---
The bad reviews are mostly haters and trolls. If you find it at reduced price I would say at least give it a shot. 
---
Not too bad. I run a similar build! My feedback:    
---
Strength: I would swap barbarian for blocker, most of the damage you end up taking is in melee range and non-PA damage resistance is going to suck no matter what usually (I'm assuming based on your perk choices you aren't using PA). And probably most important, you're really going to want "martial artist" to speed up any two handed weapon swings. Slow weapons benefit most from martial artist and it scales their damage up tremendously by increasing their damage per second. If it's hard to fit that card in I would take 2/2/2 of the slugger perks.    
---
Perception: Totally preference based by I find with melee/demo I'm doing melee 95% of the time, so I would move 2 points out of "fire in the hole" and put it in "glow sighted" unless you really like that distance    
---
Endurance: Lifegiver would be better than ghoulish because there's a mutation that gives better health regen. If you're fighting a lot of ghouls or other things that hit you with rads then "sun kissed" is pretty good.    
---
Charisma: Supressor/tenderizer are really good, even if you're just putting a single point in. I'd give that a look.    
---
Intelligence:  I used to run makeshift warrior myself but honestly things die so fast with melee that the weapon takes a long time to break. This is 5 points you can put elsewhere (charisma/endurance/perception, etc) or distribute into more useful health/defense perks like first aid  
---
Agility: Moving target I think is meh because you don't spend most of your time simultaneously sprinting/taking damage. I would either move the points somewhere else or consider "white knight" since you're not wearing PA... this will save you a ton on broken armor costs. Alternatively "dodgy" is better damage reduction but I find it wasteful of AP, especially if you're power attacking a lot.    
---
Luck"
---
The Vault boy gnome. My snarky answer would be any item I don’t pay real money for.  
---
confirmed, i tried this as well and had a sad :(
---
I read that but what is backwards?
---
How about the eyebot playing colonial music leading a pack of friendly radrats? Pretty amusing!
---
Yes they are if your trying to sell them like the OP is. 
---
If you want to do it the hard way, but are happy to buy them off players, that's just ... odd. 
---
I agree but disagree with this.  The way this game appears to have been planned out was part mmo and part survival. Sure you can use perks to reduce the amount of the survival aspect you have to deal with, but to almost eliminate like to me it sounds like you're saying would be removing an aspect of the game. I think my need to find water and food to keep going is part of the game and it something to balance with everything else. It helps that you can make enough water purifiers and other food sources at your camp once  you're far enough along that it almost becomes trivial. For me it just turns into "hmmmmm what stat boosts do I want this time..." when making food.  Same for me goes with junk, if you want to hoard it (Like many players do) that's a choice and thus the need for perk cards to handle that.
---
Now that the disagreement is out of the way, I 100% agree with you on the condition perks are almost too necessary at this point. I would have shit armor at this point if it wasn't for White Knight because I'd be out of ballistic scraps to repair my rare gear and my guns would break during every outing without Gunsmith. I'm on the fence about some of the weight perks as I see how they allow you to play a packrat-hoarding kind of character picking up everything instead of having to consider if you really want that extra stimpack you find.
---
Yeah, I mean if nothing else have one core pop immediately.
---
It's not like you can't find cores in the game. I'd rather they just take it our completely and replace it with something else than have it stay the way it is now.
---
True!
---
new hairstyle on the Atom store works out at £4.99 or so....for a hairstyle!?!
---
Bad Bethesda, shame on you Todd!
---
Clever Vault-Girl...
---
Well that's not how this one is. Trust me I'm used to the whole keep heavy as weapons and guns in a infinite container like in old titles, but it isn't like that anymore. You have to decide what you want to keep, limit yourself, or deal with the consequence of having almost maxed or maxed out stash due to your hoarding tendencies. I kept a lot of weapons and armor in the beginning too. I complained too, but once I limit myself and prioritized what I needed and what I didn't stash is no longer a problem. I don't want to sound like a dick but that's just how it is in this game now op.
---
Most people here are going to tell you yes, it's worth it.  Most of the players here are enjoying Fallout 76 in SPITE of it's shortcomings and just enjoying it for what it is while waiting for Bethesda to pull it all together into a more cohesive experience and add more content.  
---
I currently have 300 hours in the game across many different characters and I am still playing for 4+ hours a day with friends, still making videos for it daily, and still on these forums daily watching people talk about their experiences in the wasteland as well.
---
In short, my biased opinion is yes, give it a shot.
---
You had a stash box? Luxury. All we had was a paper sack for our scrap. It despawned and we'd have to start a new one every time we got disconnected.
---
No. They aren't. Why are you lying to this guy?
---
make sure to press space to search the containers AFTER you loot them, sometimes the server takes a few seconds to update the container too so wait for the animation and sound to happen. I average 10 stims a run, sometimes however itll give me a ton of rad-x, rad-away or antibiotics instead.
---
I wish you could build a camp around it and keep it there. Camp Megaton.
---
I found its to do with still wearing your normal armour when getting into the PA, try unequipping it then entering to see if that's the case. 
---
It did for me. It didn't do that before until after some updates 
---
I want to get all the achievements, after that I'm probably out. 
---
lmao that is hilarious
---
I will thnx
---
Put dog on keyboard.
---
How long did u have to wait before it got fixed?
---
Plus if its the one I am thinking of you can find it for free in Fallout 4, same with the tattoos.
---
It wasn't a bounty being passed. You always lose caps for dying in PvP, bounty or not
---
I mean it is a simulation. I live in Charleston, WV. It's much more grim and full of despair in real life.
---
Damn, I would love to get in on this. Should also be on in about 7ish hours. 
---
https://youtu.be/fJzE41IeXtI&amp;t=m4s14
---
Yes! I was just trying to remember that myself.
---
They would be a dick if they're doing this constantly to speed up their xp gain over others. Sometimes I'd do something like this for a second if I see a low lvl being swarmed by too many enemies... context matters.
---
Imma try it 
---
HAHA
---
Not sure where to report this to, I tried looking through the report-able ticket site but could've find anything. 
---
Issue: Whenever you have a C.A.M.P in a cave I usually spawn under/out of the map and have to walk back in. Could just be the way the terrain around the C.A.M.P is, and it isn't a big deal because I've attempted trying to go to places. The game will push you out eventually because you touch the surface. 
---
Issue: Whenever you build in a cave and you build foundations, sometimes you cannot remove them. It mentions something around "Cannot remove due to the structure being inaccessible"
---
Sorry if I'm not that helpful and I think the first issue isn't a problem, but the second one annoys me so much. Honestly I could gladly wait like 6 months for the second issue to be fixed because it isn't a pressing matter compared to most of the glitches I have read up on.
---
Tesla rifle and molotovs.
---
Instructions unclear. Now the terminals are zoomed way in. 
---
Sorry you had some bad encounters with other players. I was just curious if I was screwing myself or my teammate by knee capping all the glowy ghouls and moving on to let others get a few hits in and finish them off. I still get xp, and can still loot just the same, and the ghouls are harmless since all they can do is crawl around slowly. 
---
Well there's just standard mods like shadowed, ultra-light, etc... also leather is better than metal or power armor, etc..
---
Also don't forget the chameleon effect can be found on legendary armor pieces... that one works regardless of if you're wearing armor or not.
---
Why haven’t I done this? Good stuff!
---
I believe the correct wire is supposed to be random every time, so you learned nothing.
---
The Juke box should really play actual songs not just classical.
---
Place them both down to see if they are actually the same, power armor frames are all named the same thing in inventory, but can have different armor in them.
---
Also, what did Charli ever do to you?!
---
Shit response maybe but have you tried "turning it off and on again"? Just restarting?
---
Wonderful detailed response.  Take +1 internet point.
---
Thanks for the details, it is much appreciated.
---
That's it? No explanation? Unlike other social media formats, this isn't a forum to just spout anything that comes to mind. Please let us know the circumstances and what lead up to the duplication. Let us know what kind of PA it was. Let us know the quest you were on. This leaves nothing for us to work with.
---
Wires change every time. I had a base that spawned these nearby. 
---
My modded gatling plasma does the same thing only I can maybe get 2 and a half cores used before it's broken...
---
Yeah, no dice.
---
My favorite part of survival mode in FO4 was being forced to walk everywhere. I need to get back in the habit of that. I just hate not being able to get up mountains.
---
I really liked how in AC: Odyssey, you could go in a straight line anywhere. You could climb any mountain.
---
What we really need instead of a server wipe is for Bethesda to be able to target players like him and ban their accounts permanently OR completely wipe their accounts and all characters without a ban. This will take most of the duped items out of the game without punishing anyone else. Even if I had saved every item I have gotten since I started like 150 hours ago I wouldnt have 1m in my inventory. Should be easy enough to find people like this and ban them.
---
12,000 serum recipies? BAN
---
15,664,232 steel? BAN
---
Its not hard, its all in a database somewhere. Once they have the tools to find them, these people are done, hopefully for good. I support a perma ban for anyone who has taken duping to these levels because they have contributed to the decimation of the player economy and made it a joke so that the rarest plans in the game for example only go for like 1k now tops, and even then you sit on them for days before you find a buyer sometimes.
---
According to Bethesda, only players with Wanted status should lose their own caps when dying.
---
This is most likely not intended.
---
I sing without knowing it a lot of the time. I work as an artist, and it's just one of those tics that i've taken up when I concentrate for a long period of time.
---
Yepper, that's what I was going for with that particular character, it's fun to play when you are having a bad day and just wish the world would disappear lol.
---
Weird outfits? The steel workers uniform, any of the sack hoods, and a chainsaw. Just walk slowly at somebody. Stop when they look at you. And a few seconds later whip that tree cutter out and keep walking at them. 
---
Holy crap.  Your Raider brain is genius.  In the way all those Marvel movies added up to 2 massive Infinity Wars movies... DLCs actually coming first.
---
Dude, you want more bugs and glitches? ;)))  This legendary system is few years old, even if slightly changed for F76, It's still messy. There are so many more important bugs and glitches BSD should remove, that adding new system would ruin the game. That's my opinion, at least...
---
I saw it disarmed in a YouTube video. I forget which wire it was now. When I found one, I'm sure I picked the same wire and it exploded. 
---
If you like Fallout games then yes. If you've never played Fallout before you might be safer trying Fallout 4 first.
---
Wrong lever!
---
Great advice.  Thanks!   And also sad that this “improvement” leads to only “few” crashes per day.   
---
I’m amazed at the loyalty to this game.  FO4 was my favorite game of all time.  I could have played expansions of that game for the rest of my life.   When FO76 came out and it was seemingly and extension of FO4, I was elated.   Now having played it, I’m severely disappointed in the balance of the game play and more so the instability of the platform.  Very disappointing.  Obviously this isn’t going to be a popular point of view in this sub but it needs to be said if we want Bethesda to be held to the fire for better Fallouts in the future.  If all we as Fallout fans do is tell each other to shut up and consider yourself lucky we have anything... that is what Bethesda will be challenges to give us next.  
---
I run this mod, it's great.  If Bethsoft isn't able to figure out how to fix their duplication glitch after two weeks they aren't going to come after you for running a modified sound file.
---
Go to Grafton Steel and kill the endless waves of super mutants, take their weapons, put scrapper perk card on, then get to scrappin those weapons. 
---
I’ll get in on this I’ll be on in about 8 hrs
---
Psn Ska00L
---
Try launching the game using the .exe not the launcher, means you need to log I'm every time, but may help...
---
Yeah i get that and at level 85 I've had to do the same, the point is we shouldn't have to. 
---
Its a poor game design that forces us to do that. Bethesda wouldn't have said they are going to carry on increasing it till they find the sweet spot if they didn't acknowledge it was a problem.
---
Steel is super common everywhere.  On PC you can go into the junk section, press C to go into component view, and there you can mark steel with a magnifying glass so that every junk item that contains steel will have a magnifying glass for easy pick-up.
---
Loot the weapons off of every enemy you find and equip Scrapper perk (int lvl 13 perk) when you junk them all down.  If I run low on steel I just mark it for search, grab all enemy weapons and armor, grab all junk that contains steel, and I can easily pick up 100+ at basically any marked area.  I know that 10mm pistols are an easy 6 steel without the perk equipped.  If you're farming scrap, you can get yourself a literal ton of steel with no trouble.
---
acid (used to make gunpowder at a chem bench) and lead are a bit harder to find, though still pretty common.  I always have those marked for picking.  I have no idea what level you are, but using ammosmith (available in Agility at lvl 34) and Super Duper (luck tree lvl 50) dramatically eases the burden of making ammunition.
---
Of all the perks in the game, when you go through level 50-53, immediately max out Super Duper.  It gives you a 30% chance to make double ammo, food, chems, aid, flux, armor, weapons, explosives or anything that's not a bulked scrap.
---
Don't hoard gunpowder in your stash.  It weighs a lot.  It's tempting to hang on to it, but ammo weighs far less than the powder/lead/steel components, so I just pick it up and craft whenever I find a tinker's bench.  I've been burning through a ton of ammo with all the nukes over the past couple days, so my cloth, acid, lead and steel reserves are well depleted.

---
I think that is a fair assessment. New to fallout, f4 is a good introduction. 
---
One time I was attacking an ass load of feral ghouls and this guy 10 levels above me came out of no where right after I finished killing them and scared the living hell outta me. So I jumped and immediately attacked him thinking it was another ghoul. Gave him the heart emote and he came up and hit me once then ran off. It was funny but I think a definite "whoops" or "Sorry" emote would be super helpful lol
---
This looks like you have this rant in a docx and just copy paste.
---
Id be careful. Bethesda will ban you lol
---
On the other hands, for last twenty years I have been dreaming of proper online game and I currently believe that the path to such game leads through iterative development of the online gaming framework based on inputs from tens of thousands of users - guess what, just as Bethesda is now building. At the same time, I have some knowledge on how you build these kinds of stuff and from such perspective, to me it appears that people at Bethesda knows exactly what they are doing.
---
Releasing a game with such ambition and scale that you cannot realistically make sure that economy will not become a hit at day1 due to griefers? Limit caps availability, have an unused slots for legendary prefixes so you can change the meta once the game stabilizes.
---
I am fallout fan since I played the F1 demo on my Macintosh computer, and while I agree that F76 can be described as early access release, I consider opinions of those who deem this game worthless as worthless themselves. Bite ya ass.
---
Its not, its all about how you play.  This is not FO 4, etc.  You cant pack rat like you are used to doing.  You can mitigate some of this via perks, equipment and mods, or you can adjust your play style accordingly.  Legionaries do not scale when you level, you cant scrap them and they only take up space if you cant actually use them. Sell that crap to vendors or give it away to people that can use it.
---
this isn't a new system, only a few items in loot tables and some new crafting schematics.
---
to elaborate on this, you get the maximum price reduction from having charisma at 25, and each level of the hard bargain perk counts as 3 charisma for the purposes of trading. i bought/traded for a full set of unyielding armor for buying/selling and crafting because of the +15 total bonus to all stats but endurance.
---
If it's less than $40 then yea. It's fun, but not a full price. 
---
If you can Amazon.ca has the tricentennial edition for about $35 cnd

he turns to a pile of dust but in the preview event i remember footage of him dying and he just turns into a ragdoll after playing his death animation

Number one on OP’s post is found on the Whitesprings bunker on a terminal by the executive suite in the cabinet room. You’re reading the minutes from a cabinet meeting.  A general is telling the president about the vss. I  too saw the graffiti on one of the monorails base that says Nothing Is Real next to raider corpses. Could be cosmetic, could be meaningful. 
---
Point I’m trying to make is OPs theory has legs on it, he’s no pulling it out of his butt 
---
I feel like that would give players a high incentive to take a workshop but not necessarily defend the workshop.  So the contested point would become more of a revolving door.
---
Yeah agreed this EXP partial share could also make sense for group events that players are joined to - and would be nice if it could affect loot spawns in those cases (not having to tag enemy etc.)
---
Could even encourage more people to join those events.
---
Do not come to this subReddit asking if you should buy this game. Thats like walking into a Toyota car dealership and asking which car is the best car to buy? Obviously there's gonna be biased with their answers.

And lastly, here you go. A completely objective review from December 4th. Not much has changed since https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43FN_HVtwQE
---
Watch some gameplay on youtube, no need commentary or shit - if it looks fun and enjoyable to you, buy it / if it doesn't, don't buy it.
---
If you played Fo4 you should have an idea of how is it, if you did not, watch some gameplay of Fo4. (also if you don't want to get spoilers on Fo76)
---
Game is not perfect but it is enjoyable.
---
I just wish you could modify the dress to remove the ruffles. The "tattered" dress doesn't have them and looks better because of it. 
---
It is imperfect but tremendous fun nonetheless.  
---
You're right - it tends to always have nuke leftovers, or just regular spawns that are at least 40+
---
Maybe it's in there because you can kite everything over to the bots to level when you're 1-10?
---
Done. Sorry it's my first post and I didn't know how this subreddit worked particularly.

---
made some QOL changes for more damage output not using vats annyways. now added swapcards.
---
The only thing we definitively know exists...is our own conscience. Everything else could simply be an illusion Or a figment of our mind
---
Nope. Move on to something else. 
---
I just like having one piece of chameleon armor on, that's enough for me, and it's great for PvP
---
&gt;...assuming it would auto load the new fusion...
---
It does that automatically, you don't have to do this :-p and my question: Did you "drop" the armor from the apparel tab or did you "select and place" the armor? Because dropping the armor drops it "owner-less" in the game world while "select and place" looks exactly the same in that it places the armor somewhere in the game world but you never lose ownership. The two look exactly the same but one way will lose your armor and the other will not.
---
They were fully the exact same I was so confused (on another note Charli has done nothing wrong we love her in this C.A.M.P)
---
Which is the parent company of Bethesda so zenimax is running it
---
The Veil of Secrets causes that, not the dress.
---
The game is broken, but you can't fix something until it is broken. The community has found most everything that is broken and it's getting fixed quick enough. Most of the negativity is from the shady stuff Bethesda did with marketing, and I like to separate the company from the developers. This game is enjoyable even with its issues and it will only get better.
---
It happened to me on pc when I changed the FOV bar in settings. Im very sure that is your problem.
---
It also give to me some inmediate an serious motions sicknes that nothing, not games or vehicles IRL (cars, planes, helicopters), have give me ever.
---
Yea I know I get where your coming from. But at this point with how this game is going players just have to pretty much just suck it up and deal with it, myself included. You have no idea how many times I've found awesome weapons that I wanted to keep, but it would've taken up a lot of weight in my inventory and a lot in my stash so I've had to drop it or sell it. (I have a mule character now so I don't gotta worry) but still.
---
 I get we should be able to loot every piece of scrap and gun we come across its fallout! But this isn't the same fallout were used to anymore op. We got stuck in the ground bandits, naked mutants and the occasional invisible ghoul. I don't think stash increase is as big as a problem as other things atm lol.
---
I’ll be online in a few hours 
---
You really don't even need max endurance, just enough to get the key perks like lifegiver.  Between armor pen negating most or all of your DR/ER you want the skills and abilities that increase your damage, armor pen for your damage, and have flat % based reductions (Blocker, Dodgy, Serendipity, Lone Wanderer, Nerd Rage, etc) and buffs that increase damage, HP, damage resist %.  Assassin pieces make a pretty huge difference especially if you get Dense mod on them to greatly lower boom boom damage from TSEs.
---
Get party boy and good boy.
---
Alcohol gives you 45%.
---
Canned dog foods give you 30%.
---
I sustain my body on a careful, measured diet of 2 2 liters of whiskey and 3 cans of dog food a day. Sprinkle in some dirty water and actual dog meat if I'm feeling fancy.
---
It hasn't been the best time since I made it out.

Dunno much aboot PC sadly.

In every PvP situation I have seen, you always pay caps if you lose
---
I've had one person say something to me. He was using my camp &amp; said "what's up dude?" &amp; I replied &amp; he ran away. Not sure if it's because he was expecting a guy or thought I was a 12 year old boy 😂 
---
Damn ima need to see that
---
I'm on PC and using a keyboard. Push to talk pretty much jut happened before they added it for me and now it doesn't work and I have no way to switch between the two easily. I miss hearing people and actually talking. Sick and tired of trying to guess what people are saying from this games emotes. 
---
Evidently this game is not for you
---
^(It is a slow day at work so here ya go:)
---
**Balance**
---
*Power Armor:*
---
No thank you, power armor feels tanky enough already. That being said, people aren’t steam rolled into the same playstyle due to it. About half the people I regularly play with don’t use it at all and we are all lvl 100+ these days. Also, dear god don’t link weapon damage to special. This reduces the number of effective builds even more and the last thing we need is another buster thing like melee. Unlink melee from str if anything.
---
*Nukes:*
---
Da fug? “Decrease spawn rates in nuke zones ?” Wa-I don’t even know …. NO, INCREASE SPAWNS IN ALL NUKE ZONES ^(except whitepsrings)
---
*Two-Shot Explosive Weapons:*
---
TSE is fine and fun. Need more challenging enemies and better mitigation vs explosives for pvp.
---
*Scorchbeasts:*
---
Agree on fixing the shooting backwards bug. They do need somewhat better loot but certainly not guaranteed legendaries. Things go down in a couple seconds for most endgame builds.
---
**Features**
---
*PvP and Workshops:*
---
Pvp needs a complete overhaul due to being entirely unbalanced so I have no comment here related to your suggestion other than making workshops open pvp will make even less people want to claim them since THIS IS NOT A PVP FOCUSED GAME.
---
*Workshops:*
---
Agreed. Workshops are not worth the time past early game.
---
*Nuke Zones:*
---
Agreed. There should be at LEAST 5 megabosses that can be spawned with this and people have put forth plenty of ideas that would get this done.
---
*Vaults:*
---
Based on the data mining, you are gonna be depressed. Me too though, I feel ya.
---
*A Living World:*
---
This would take more work to implement properly than I see Bethesda doing. Sounds nice though.
---
*Legendary Scrapping/Crafting:*
---
Scrap for special currency to reroll (on a per effect basis) would be baller. Needs to be a REALLY high cost though.
---
**Quality of Life**
---
*More Players:*
---
Nah, don’t need more people per map. There are only a few endgame focused areas and once we have even the full 24 people, they are all overcamped.
---
*Server Hopping:*
---
Yes, needs fix. Remove ALL rare plans from vendors and make them quest rewards or megaboss drops. Then make all vendors always have their full stock.
---
*Passive Cards and Perk Decks:* 
---
Passive feels like the best way to go here but really, if we are doing that … like 80% of the perks should be passive. Having a “certain number of passives” limit would be the same as what we have now basically. Perk decks definitely need to happen, and thanks to modders, PC has this already. Might as well make an official version.
---
he says this is an Alpha test
---
I understand the ire against the game but I've played it a little every night since Thanksgiving and I'm enjoying it. That doesn't mean I set my values or expectations low but it has been an enjoyable experience overall. 
---
But those developoers work in the company. How does this make any sense?
---
Also, bugs are being fixed "quick enough?" Can you define QUICK ENOUGH?
---
I usually say "Hello" when I'm in the vicinity of others.
---
About 1 in 30 actually responds via voice chat.
---
About 1 in 5 responds with an emote.
---
The rest either ignore me or can't hear me.
---
repair your mr handy with Weapon Artisan 3 equipped and be prepared to shit your pants when you see how much damage it does after :-)  You are welcome!
---
Queen has astonishingly high explosive resist. Wasted perks on her. The extra damage from TSE stuff helps, but straight explosive stuff like fatman and nuka grenades just bust everybodys frame-rate and piss people off during a queen hunt. 
---
It's worse getting a one star level 35 piece of wood armor.
---
That's my fear lmao
---
I am planning to this weekend if my buddies are available, should be able to get the last few things I need tonight playing to make it possible.  I doubt it will be a one minute kill but it should still be a very noticable damage output until the durability drops on the chainsaw, at which point I switch to another.
---
Thanks for the input, yeah I already leveled slugger up to a 3 card but I can see how martial artist would be beneficial. I would just hate to redo that card so early but I guess I could put 2 points into martial and use 2 in the subsequent weapon cards until I can fix it. 
---
I also had one point already into moving target but that’s a lot easier to fix. I use power attacks a lot so dodgy seems to be  less attractive for that reason.
---
Thanks again!
---
legendary enemies have a chance at not dropping anything.
---
&gt;but you can't get upset that someone else's play style ruins yours
---
I absolutely can. The moment someone's playstyle negatively impacts mine is when i start calling it out.
---
The fact that this playstyle in particular is fueled by exploits is why we are so vocal and black and white about it. 
---
I personally Don't openly yell at anyone playing differently than i do, but in this case it's more than justified because like you said  *this goes beyond TSE weapons*.
---
The way I farm, majority of the ghouls are dying within a short period (i.e. 2 minutes of circling around, then ALL mobs die in one magazine within few seconds). I am 100% sure that I had some legendary bodies that disappeared, but man I am still throwing out forty legendaries a day.
---
Furious doesn't seem to proc except on power attacks sadly.  Bloodied however would be AMAZING!
---
Got mine at Harper ferry so far left arm right leg 
---
it depends on where you build your camp the whitesprings is not safe because there is a fissure site to the south of it and they usually attack the whitesprings and then leave going east towards the train station and my old camp loaction. my current camp is closer to  the top of the worlds train station and only gets attacked by 2-3 enemies randomly but i haven't encounterd a schorchbeast my entire time being there 
---
I think someone had an suggestion to allow us to use a duplicate on a maxed out perk card to make it animated. Or otherwise allow us to recycle the cards towards something else (e.g. caps or even towards a new card pack)
---
But yeah, diff star levels of perks give some flexibility later on... duplicates of single star perks are more annoying IMO
---
I've grown to enjoy melee weapons and my Level 20 character can take Super Mutants out with 1-2 hits. Then I discover cave crickets! :) 
---
I wish the stats it gets were better, it's still crap 30dr/30er with the eye of Ra equipped.
---
What if you have an explosive handmade that you found legitimately and no one believes you because of the damage it does ( assassin, explosive, quick reload with almost every relevant perk card ) ? 
---
For this reason I nomad by myself and run at the sight of other players, I don’t like hearing people complain because I played the game before they did and managed to get something better than they have. 
---
Thanks for the input! I alternative with a group which makes builds sort of situational but I build as if I am solo and swap what I can in cha.
---
&gt;I am not blind to the flaws and bugs of fo76. I am also not blind to the fact I absolutely love the game. I enjoy playing it and have alot of fun doing so.
---
That's me. I see and know of the flaws but I'm enjoying the heck out of it...
---
Until the servers stop freezing and disconnecting the workshops are useless. 
---
Right 90%of the bad reviews are more then likely from people who have not played the game and are from the youtubers hate section 
---
Was having such a big issue with Xbox stability that I just refused to at it on console anymore. Bought it on PC and it's been a much smoother ride, but now I have no one to play with. 
---
Would be nice if they fixed these issues on console so I can go back and join my friends. 
---
I'd honestly be surprised if Automatron-style robot crafting wasn't planned for sometime down the line. All the assets are already there, they just need to make sure it won't break the game somehow. Plus you know Bethesda isnt going to miss the opportunity to charge us $20 for the privilege of painting our robots pink.
---
How else would you make people think they were in an actual timeline? 
---
I've always found that workshops are more trouble than they're worth.  The extractors are fairly slow and the area itself is a needy baby that needs to be defended often.  I don't want to go off exploring because I'll have to defend it at any minute.  The PC player base is largely great and friendly, but I've found it difficult to maintain the Converted Munitions Factory for over an hour without babysitting it constantly.
---
People keep calling slow progression a "grind." These are sooo different. A grind is having to run the same trial/dungeon 18 times and still not getting the armor piece you want. Or running daily's 25 times to get 50 stones that you can use to change the attribute on one of your weapons or armor.
---
Getting specific mods, plans, or legendary's will be the grind in this game.
---

try that.
---
At least 70% of the mystery contained within the garb of mystery is localized within the ruffles of mystery.  It's about surface area.
---
I quit after taking an hour and a half soloing the first silo I ever did then proceeding to crash while fighting the queen. 
---
without the skin it plays the correct audio, but once I put the skin on melee becomes completely silent
---
I've now got something new to do around people, thanks for the fun ideas!
---
Lol, Im missing the chest and legs heavy combat, and missing BOS arms.
---
In other words, I can mod dropped heavy chest and legs into BOS, and can craft heavy arms, but cant make a full set of BOS heavy. Go figure.
---
 I dont remember what I got where, bc I got them around the same time, but I remember finding one on a dead scorchbeast at the end of glass cavern (specifically, the first one on the right entering the last room). The other I got from distant thunder. Dont remember how I got the third one.
---
If you are on xbox, I got a 1* unyielding heavy bos chest piece im trying to get rid of. Or I can craft/mod any of those pieces for you I have unlocked
---
Oh look another youtuber shill 
---
Well pal, time to upgrade to PC.
---
2 Accounts, one PC.. I got given a second one (long boring story)
---
The 1st person view isn't the best, but I love the 3rd person :)
---
They dont need to look at every account, and they can easily create those tools. Every character is a file on a database somewhere, and that file can be read/scanned. Its really that simple. If they dont have the tools now, Im sure they are working on them. Its not like these files are encrypted beyond their ability to access or anything. The dupers time is limited, and I hope they know that. I hope they realize that every day they play they are playing on borrowed time- time given to them only because of Bethesdas lack of beta testing and lack of planning. One day they will try to log in and wont be able to- or alternatively they will log into empty accounts with no characters or no inventory left on their characters.
---
If this starts happening then even if the duping still works, it will be scaled WAY BACK as people will become afraid to dupe as they rightly should be. People are doing what they are doing now because they think they can get away with it forever, and there is a slight possibility that this will be the case. However its much more likely that Bethesda will simply figure out how to scan the files on their database and begin banning people in the near future.
---
When the recipe call for rare but you like'em well done.
---
Dmg resist, a stealth boost and maybe something   else. Also the final quest in the chain gives an
---
item that can only be worn with the garb that boost all the items except the veil .
---
Not a bad point, does you linking them like that effectively tag them?&gt;
---
No worries dude, best part about games like this, especially with perk cards, is that a lot of it is personal preference and situational unless you are someone who likes to ultimate min max, and even there the current game metas provide some wiggle room.
---
Doing events is a net profit.. in XP, Stims, foot, other junk, plans, weapons, armor, basically everything.  And caps too.. you make more than you spend.  For workshops, it's all that and quicker and you make even more caps.
---
Farming for stims would be a waste of time given the opportunity cost.
---
And.. if you're server hopping, read above, you can just leave and go back in.
---
I actually want that to be a thing!
---
&gt; until stop feigning outrage over nothing
---
Make me.
---
“Can’t believe they left their resource extractor unlocked” 
---
To say when you encounter a locked resource extractor at a base....
---
Watch them rush out in horror :-)
---
This game has so much potential to be community building. Imagine what we could do with dedicated servers?
---
For a little clarification.  You can put power armour components on and off the frame on of high level, but you can't enter the frame until you're that level.
---
Shocks aren't that terrible to come up with eventually by serving hopping Watoga, but you're probably better off just buying the jetpack from a subreddit. Most people are wearing X-01 before they ever find a T-51 jet randomly.
---
Well, that explains that spot next to my camp in the forest then. Random things often happening there each time I log in. Sometimes it is a suitcase with a note to get something from a nearby mine, sometimes it is a crashed vertibird, and one time it was a collapsed tent. Pretty cool to know these are all over!
---
Not a mandatory scorchbeast defence, though I have had a few, but always a mandatory *something* defence after a couple minutes of capping the zone. 
---
I'm not sure about the location op mentioned. However, I used to keep a camp near Twin Lakes and it has a behemoth spawn point. Most likely it's the one you encountered at level 20. From the Twin Lakes icon head southwest. You should run into a creek. Follow the creek down the mountain until you see a small pond. The behemoth always spawns in that pond.
---
&gt;...low health PA 1h fast melee build...
---
Wha? Why? For nerd rage?
---
&gt;So my question then, would a TSE harpoon or a Bloodied+Explosive be a better option?
---
Literally tried this last night, though mind you my harpoon gun is mutated/explosive not two-shot/explosive. It sucks ass, even with full perks. It fires/reloads too slowly and even when it hits the damage is negligible. Pretty much any other heavy weapon would be better. Gatling blows it out of the water. If you go fletchettes then you might as well use a shotgun instead, it will do way more damage.
---
I dont mind there not being a dj. No interruptions  between songs. But they could have easily made a robot dj in vault 76. Just stick a radio tower on the vault, and add a little dj room with a robot thats got a personality 
---
I’m not your mommy or daddy, so I can’t raise you not to be a little bitch. You’ll just have to learn that yourself.
---
I often try teaming up with lower levels in nuke zones just to share Rad sponge with them so they don't have to fear the rads Eatting them up
---
Came to say this exactly. There seems to be a lot of bad logic floating around this sub...
---
Don't forget about the weird texture glitches in the world where instead of a complete texture you get a bit of purple screen and text code... Bethesda programming error or error in the simulation program we're stuck in? \*hmmm\*
---
Yeah I’m level 15 and am at 585/600 and that’s after scrapping everything and getting rid of higher level weapons and power armor pieces.  I dread coming online everyday and having to deal with my person being over encumbered and then having to deal with my box being full it’s really starting to b a turnoff.
---
It's not that coveted, actually, it's considered the worst mutation(I'll still get it on my sniper for RP purposes).  If the effect was permanent while sneeking, even if moving, then it'd be good and worth the time farming for good Weightless armor, but as is, it's only good when combined with nade spamming or sniping with Long Range 3(meaning no VATS) from an elavated hight
---
The developers are governed by the company, and have little choice what bad marketing Bethesda makes. The developers have been working on patches since release, like minor hot fixes, and big patches like day one and another this month. If anyone thinks the sit around doing nothing, that's untrue. And Bethesda management probably reassigned developers to work on DLC, like the vaults, instead of fixing bugs.
---
Correct, but the above method will allow the stuff to enter your stash and only take up 10kg space rather than approx 60kg individual total
---
Yeah, I don't know why I said mandatory considering it was my first and only workshop claim haha
---
&gt;Do not come to this subReddit asking if you should buy this game. 
---
Yeah you'll get biased people here but at least most actually play the game and all are aware of the flaws. It matters to understand why some people actually enjoy the mess.
---
I wouldn't trust more people on r/gaming or r/fallout, their opinions are as much biased in the other side tho.
---
Under the bridge on the road just north of Whitesprings train station is another one.
---
Like I said before, publisher decisions are sometimes out of developer hands. We dont know what happened over there. And all I'm saying is youtubers are banking on negativity and misinformation. They certainly aren't helping anyome but themselves. 
---
How do you run 2 accounts on the same PC at the same time? Sorry for the questions, but I would consider this too, just for convenience.
---
Partially its push to talk, and partially that people still prefer discord over in game methods for most games played these days.
---
I've bought the Succulents for my CAMP and that's it.
---
Have a screenshot? Also try logging out and back in, I've had a few phantom items show up in my camp that weren't actually there.
---
I love you &lt;3
---
Oh hell yeah lol, bugger to reload but cool right?
---
Plus I play this game on two different computers. One is an RTX-powered beast, the other one is my tablet with integrated GPU. I assure you that there are situations in which my weak PC just surrenders displaying stuff. There are some buildings that are invisible on my tablet - you see all the enemies inside, standing on air. The funniest case is when I look at my camp to the east side, its displayed correctly, but when I look to the west, it becomes invisible and only turrets can be seen, floating midair. This might be that your PC is unable to handle something F76 would like to display to you and so F76, instead of trying and trying, just surrenders.
---
I had a friend play on my tablet once, we went to whitespring and stood on the canopy above the back exit, looking into golf club lounge through the windows. You need marsurpial or jetpack to get there, but this is 100% the best possible spot to farm ghouls alone in the golf club. All the kills, zero damage taken. I could clearly see three ghouls on my PC, while the tablet dude only seen two - we tested this and he was not able to plant a hit on the invisible ghoul, but was able to be damaged by it.
---
We need a "Turn On your Mic" emote.
---
It's nearly impossible to trade with people that don't voice Chat, and the silent ones only seem to want my TSE weapons.
---
Do they Really think I want to sell my only TSE Handmade or Shotgun for 500 caps?
---
Also it would be nice to have all favorited weapons and equipped Armor not even show up in the Trade inventory.
---
This is the reason why my X-01 jetpack changed my life. I feel like I can walk almost anywhere now.
---
I have two monitors as well but I prefer to just game on one with other junk open on the second monitor.  Otherwise the cross hair is right smack dab in the bezel gap between the monitors making it a little distracting.  I remember in the Nvidia settings (IDK about amd) or windows display settings, there's an option to change how your desktop is displayed across the monitors, span is the option you want.  Make sure both monitors are also displaying at native resolution.
---
Hunger and thirst perks should operate like their equivalents in the Sims.  That is, if I have the perks in those games my sim won't need to eat or use the bathroom except for maybe once or twice a day.  I don't personally have a problem maintaining hunger and thirst in 76, even hopping up on chems as I tend to do, but perks ought to make it all but forgettable.
---
Oh no, they definitely do respawn while someone is in there. Learned that the hard way as a lower level. Happened the other day again while I was looting, luckily now I can survive the onslaught. 
---
The mutations I am referring to effect all damage such as adrenal reaction.
---
If you want the perfect build, just buy them. Then have level 2 "Startched Genes". Problem solved. I currently have 8 mutations. I've had at least 6 of them for the last 50hours of the game.
---
That's just how YouTube works these days.  Google's goal is to keep you watching, and what better way to do that than to keep you *angry*.  Their algorithm skews toward presenting extreme views - you can see their feelers even in videos that have no relation to what you're currently watching - and you get swarmed with the things if you happen to click one.  People who know better, like you and me, can see right through it.  But many can't, and it contributes to the toxic debate climate across all kinds of subjects these days, especially when people are more concerned with herd approval than separating fact from fiction.
---
If people don't like Fallout 76, that's fine.  I support that.  What I don't support is the lynch mob mentality of "I don't like it, so you can't either" / "You are *wrong* for liking it."
---
Dead. Lmao 😂
---
I love my fish lamp! All hail, fish lamp!
---
Revealing that FO76 was, in fact, just another re-release of Skyrim, will Todd Howard ever stop?
---
I think thay work because I know that a lot of game developers to browse these sites to get an idea of what the community is doing and how they feel. they just don't post due to all the toxic Behavior. It's really sad because I know a lot of us who really enjoy the game and accept it for what it is instead of insisting it be something that it's not would love to have a Q&amp;A session with them to learn more things about the game.
---
&gt; Played for 200 hours
---
&gt; Unplayable and broken
---
Sure bud.
---
Ok walmart version then lol.
---
Cola Bomb!
---
It's not really like that.  Arms flying off is a new object with physics that's done client side.  Blood spraying is just an animation or particle effect.  All of it is in game and works fine, just not on players.  I bet is more of a game rating type issue.
---
How did you know they both had Two-Shot and not some other prefix with explosive? My friends and I share legendaries we find with whoever needs it so all of us have at least explosive weapons including two explosive shotguns we've found naturally. No duping. No buying from other players. Could it not be the same for those two in the mine?
---
I've found 6 different Two-Shot weapons and I'm only level 83. It's RNG.
---
Great info.
---
I'm not sure I understand what you are saying.
---
Take the Ammo Factory and hold it during non-peak hours.
---
Alternately Grafton Steel or aggro low level robots at events in the Forest
---
I'm on pc but can show you pictures of it.
---
If it's his nuke, it's fair game for him to do what he wants. If not, that person needs to learn some consideration. 
---
Did you play ESO? Supposedly that game launched in a pretty bad state too and it has become pretty good. I don’t care for the game so I’ve only put about 2 hours into it and I can’t speak to the state of the game currently or at launch. I do want Fo76 to succeed because I have fun with it at times but I’m concerned that the may have screwed the game up for good. I’m going to play Anthem pretty heavily when it launches and hopefully Fo76 will make major improvements while I’m away. BTW, thanks for the reply and quick rundown of the core issues and thanks for not being a dick about it. 
---
Didn't catch that, but it's true. 200 hours and it was literally hell for about 20-50 of them
---
Grafton steel has a ton of super mutants and steel resources.  Collect all the guns and take over workshop.
---
Make sure to use ammo perk card and super duper.
---
Are you saying yes to TSE or no I cant tell?
---
It scares me how hard people say it is to get... Same with calibrated shocks. I’ll never be able to use anything besides excavator armor.
---
Is this actually a thing?
---
It would be brilliant. But it’s giving them a lot of credit. 
---
I hadn't even thought of that. Thanks, jda!
---
Limit your weapons and armor, sell off the stashed meds you don't use, Bulk your Junk and sell off some of the excess bulk, but NEVER get rid of the Springs and Screws. That is something I have been doing lately and I am keeping my stash between 500-560, when it gets to 575+ I mass bulk and sell and or scrap what isn't needed anymore/used. 
---
I do believe that this game has a lot of design decision that were easter eggs. I also believe that the decision to have just a single nukeworthy spot besides the plot defined one (SBQ) is a clear indication what some of the Bethesda designers thought of the game of golf. I also believe this is gonna be changed, just as the phases of the game lifecycle changed. IMO we are now nearing end of phase two, and last time I projected a phase is ending soon the PvP arena changed completely in matter of days due to TSE availability.
---
Yeah I love mine. Lol
---
Noobs- look at your junk inventory before you scrap stuff and learn what components these objects give you as scrap. 
---
Some stuff is just weight-spam, some stuff you would never think is useful to pick up is actually valuable.
---
There was this whole thing after the game came out where everybody who was absolutely killing themselves for weeks to find enough enough springs to craft their suit of excavator PA went "Holy Shit! Clipboards have springs! I never mess with those because i thought they were useless junk."
---
Lots of stuff like that.
---
I had a queen get stuck in a Watoga building, she conveniently left when there was 2 minutes left and flew past 8 people only to fly out the circle and then go retreat in her fissure.
---
If u have caps i would buy from other , knowing how fast that weapons eats 100 rounds. I use all the 3 shotgun types and have bought 43000 shells over a week now. No need to worry for some time 😁
---
I think it's more I can't remember but some people have weapons in the tens of thousands with the right mutations, I meant to say even with the slap damage calculated (I honestly thought it was like 5-10%) it was coming out to be something like 80-150 slap damage and if a player has any diseases just that much can devastate them. 
---
That's pretty cool, I'm just trying to find an alternative to power armor so I don't have to keep wearing it and having 12 cores take up so much space, any recommendations? I just want to wear something that has the highest damage resistance along with energy resistance. 
---
Find the map of power armor spawns. They will spawn with a core inside.
---
"scorched earth" indeed
---
Sadly I am.  I  am playing other games until the next patch hopefully stabilizes things.   I keep tabs on the comments here to see if there are improvements.
---
Some comment further down was trying to fix his personal issue with the game by asking you to completely change how you play. That's so ridiculous to me.
---
I would like furious to be updated to regular attacks though to keep it on par with TSEs
---
Exactly, I am 86 run shotgun/melee in nuke zones. I have to break out an automatic just so I can even tag one of the enemies when too many TSE's are around. I don't have a TSE and certainly won't trade for one b/c there is no telling if it is a *dirty* one or not. 
---
It's supposed to count for any legendaries in general, according to both the game and online wikis. I'm at 6 commendation points which is probably half kills and half completing events.
---
I always leave plans, ammo, meds, weapons, armour,etc at the train stations in some container there. Usually a suitcase. So if anyone is ever around just check. I also leave stuff in the overseers stash when I come across one. 
---
You can probably go to youtube or search reddit and find locations and paths for farming fusion cores from generators and power armor spawn points. That's what I do when I get low, I know about a dozen power armor spawn points, so I'll cruise through (while not wearing PA) and pick up a few.

---
Dan Harmon talks about this in the context of what he calls "payoff based writing" for Rick and Morty.
---
He says he doesn't plan for a big complicated payoff ending because the "idea farm" that is the general public is bound to come up with more and better ideas and theories than a small room of writers ever could, and you've got millions of people picking apart your work looking for clues. Chances are the public is either going to figure out what you have planned or come up with an idea that's better than you could have ever thought of yourself, so it's better to just let the story go where it's going and not worry about any big reveals.
---
The point I'm making is that the general public picking apart your story and coming up with fan theories ia inevitable. And with all of these little details all over the place and terminal entries and stuff, I think coming up with fan theories is intended.
---
But the "this is all a simulation" thing is so hack.
---
Easiest way is to know where some power armor spawns and just grab a core from a spawned suit. I don't think it will be something you worry about. I made sure I had about 3 on hand and I have been playing probably 40 levels with not only not picking one up intentionally, but rather having to discard often. 
---
So, not really a problem once you have a few but good to know where to go in an emergency.

I had this happen last night. I was towards the end of the Taggerty story, had gotten a little overencumbered due to the chapter rewards piling up suddenly. I got out of my excavator to conserve cores, and limped towards a known stash location. Once I got there, I was puzzled to find two frames in my inventory; I was almost positive I hadn't picked up a second. I was about to scrap it, but instead I placed it to see what it was. 
---
It was, in fact, the Ultracite set, which I was under-leveled for. Now I was jumpy, because I could neither store or carry the pieces without large scale dumping of other items. I finally realized the game would recall the frame irrespective of the leveled pieces. That cost me quite a bit of sweat and obscenities.
---
Just play the game, you'll find them everywhere. There is no shortage of cores for Power Armor
---
I believe they have patched it three times now?
---
Sadly, they just seem to change stack rate and not the actual mechanic...weird.
---
Can confirm, only started happening after I changed the FOV slider on PC. 
---
What's the solution for when my Xbox goes "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!" and everything freezes? What's the simple solution for that?
---
It happens EVERY TIME I'm in my camp building.
---
"EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!" It'll stay there forever if I don't dashboard. ALSO, when this happens i lose progress BUT i don't get back the resources I expended. 
---
This fuckin game sucks.
---
Damn frustrating when you are bumped from important moments.  I soloed the silos at a high level so enemies were not an issue.   I had joined a team for this purpose and none of them showed up.   Got to the point of inserting keycard but didnt have one.  Haha. 
---
Oh. Lol. I saw that.
---
LOL- i got *one* explosive vent.
---
\[Only uses X-01 &amp; T-60\]:  ".........yay..........."
---
I've been having this problem a lot. It sucks because I usually get a workshop to catch up on resources to fix guns, or gain screws. I have an XB1 and my stash is always full because I am a hoarder. I will try getting rid of holo tapes, since those are just piling up for no reason. 
---
I've told my friends, the best thing they could do in the first or second expansion.  You load up the game.  You get a quest to go to a certain location.  You click something, the screen goes black, then you wake up in a Virtual Simulator and are greeted by the overseer.  She tells you, "Congratulations, you have passed your training!  If you can deal with those winged nightmares you can deal with anything the chinese throw at you."  Then you go to a west virginia where everyone is still alive and you have a new threat to deal with.
---
Yeah, in that point, it tagged the first two.
---
So, if you posted a reply with another two, it would actually tag them.  ETC.
---
Hmm you shouldn’t have got a bounty. Maybe you hadn’t officially joined the event. 
---
hah! there was a learning curve for sure. i would basically sit on the couch with the mouse next to me, also on the couch and the controller in my left hand using the control stick for movement. it actually didnt work out too bad despite not having all of the same options as a keyboard. 
---
I gave a lv 17 dude a fully modded lv 15 handmade and some stimpaks i had surplus, he was really happy and even gave me a treasure map for free, feels good :)
---
Yes, but I'm a Horder. I did have all the mats to make the X0-1 armor when it became available to me, so I feel justified with my hoarder lifestyle, lol.
---
They will not say yet,
---
sadly I imagine they will just add an expansion sooner then later with higher tier legendaries then deal with the idiots and morons who cheated
---
gg
---
You start to see the tricks.  Remember, the map lets you see them before they can see you.  If you notice someone with a bounty, don't jump in right away.  Check the map and watch what they do, who is around them, if they are actually moving anywhere.  If they appear to be hanging out with a high-leveled player who doesn't kill them in the same area of the map for a long time, it's probably a trap.
---
Its effects do. Kills a big part of the game (exploring / looting / player markets) when you can just buy every OP thing for a few caps. 
---
Not sure why it is so easy for you. All they do is spam the screech for a couple minutes, spray the ground with their stuff that damages you more, and go back to screeching. The one I was attacking landed maybe 2 it 3 times but I only ever got it down to just over half health before my gun broke and it flew away.
---
There is NO LEVEL required to wear just the frame.  You don't even need Fusion Cores to use only a frame.  Any other questions?
---
Okay well thanks, glad to confirm it's not just me then, but seems kind of sad in this type of game?  
---
I've tried to give new players stuff loads of times, but by the time I've rummaged my inventory they've usually ran away.  
---
No doubt man, I don't think it's working as intended and want to see it increase, was just making sure the currently correct info was shared since I spent hours testing the hell out of rippers, chainsaws, mr handy buzzblades, and drills to figure out what affects them.
---
All energy and plasma guns are trash. They break super fast even with all the perks.
---
You could server hop at whitesprings or the ski resort and grab all of the can chimes. They give u nine cans and each can gives u like 2 steel and one lead
---
might be able to fix this by creating a new character, play it until you are outside of the vault. Then log out and switch back to your main, and log in on that.
---
That was a workaround fix posted a while back by bethesda anyway..
---
Not sure if it'll fix your problem but i figured it was worth a try :)
---
I play the game with my wife and we are both ready to launce nukes for the first time as well. We are both chill, trav and explore often, share trade, often wander the map over and over same areas for goodies. Not serious farmers if this js what you like.
---

---
There is also a card in Int that makes cores last 30/60/90% longer.  With just the 30% equipped I havent used a core in days.  Also, logging out in PA recharges your core.  Not sure if bug or not, but if you are really low just log out in your iron man suit.
---
You can use 1 (3 to be save) all the time - just exit to menu when you FC is almost depleted and when you log in to game again it'll be full. You have to be in the PA when exiting game.
---
Link them 
---
Munitions Factory is a pain to hold for sure. It's the only one I have had players fight for. As for the defense quests, I kinda lile them. It gives me something to do and after I'm done I loot all my extractors and go explore
---
you were his first crush
---
I've cut green and survived though the beep scared me! Good source for some rarer mats like ballistic fiber. 
---
That explains a ton thank you !!!at least I have something to look forward to lol!
---
I throw the objects and start shooting on the floor.
---
At least it worked for me, curiosity wins
---
As you find better gear Bandolier isn't really worth it. Same with Action Boy. You can find weight reduction armor pieces and you have so much AP that refresh isn't a issue but if it is there are armor pieces that increase AP refresh. If you are trying to go for a bloodied/Unyeilding build Lifegiver is a no go. Even without that stuff Lifegiver is more of a tank perk. You don't want to tank
---
Class Freak is a must to counter the negatives of your mutations
---
One of the "Nothing is Real" spots is hidden away in Fort Defiance and it's... really trippy. That's what made me believe the simulation theory.
---
Got rid of all of the holos and notes in my stash. Held Sunshine for like 5 hours on my day off. 
---
 Happened just today, that I ventured to Lewisburg for a quest. Fresh melee character,  LVL 25, no PA yet (building excavator is literally the next thing I'll do) and a heavy sledge (not a super slege).
---
 Heard some noises and it took me some time before I realized that a higher level PA user with LMG fought super mutants for a supply drop. I wasn't sure if I should help, but then I thought I want that supply drop too and charged.  
---
 The first mutant I attacked lagged and took no damage. I ignored him and focused the others. I took at least 3 of the 5 mutants out (there is a good chance I ended the laggy one too) and I turn to the last one just to see that the other player is about to finish him of. I thought to myself "wow the lmg is really bad, but maybe I overlooked something",wave and leave for the quest.  
---
 In Lewisburg I find 3 super mutants walking up an alley. I managed to ambush a mutant with a x3 stealth attack, 1HKO. One sees me, three swings and he is gone. The third mutant ran up the alley, under constant fire from the player from before, still manages to reach him and make a few swings with his board. 
---
That shouldn't happen. 
---
Automatics and some heavy weapons need some buffs. In fo4 it didn't make much of a difference if you cleared out a raider camp with a pistol, a melee weapon,  rifle or a heavy weapon. In an survival MMO were ammo is hard to come by and takes up carry weight, weapons that use said ammo should be stronger. 
---
Yeah, it was a slog. I got the jetpack on Christmas night after going at it for most of the afternoon and night. I think the lack of people playing may have actually helped the odds.
---
I spent three whole days and nights going for the calibrated shocks. Numb and sleep-deprived, I finally gave in and bought one from a random stranger on Discord. The next time I went to the vendor, I got the other.
---
I will say that in all that time, I only saw the one jetpack that I got. I had a theory that I was competing with others who were also server hopping, because sometimes you'd see three X-01 mods, and other times there would be only two. Just a theory though.
---
For Lower level players, the Charleston Train yard is full of the little commie infiltrator robots, and each time you server hop, you can also kill the Grafton Monster in the canal, for caps and armor, and then follow the tracks toward the station for a chance encounter with the special vendor.
---
All the fashionable young lads are wearing *haute couture* into the nuke zones this season.
---
The ones wearing white patriot paint after Labor Day are just hillbillys, though.
---
I think... robobrains...? are a good way to get cores. 
---
Just get your friend or another trustworthy player to kill you like in GTAO. 
---
All of their games have been slow, buggy (terrible game-breaking ones, not just annoyances), and with outdated visuals.  They cut many corners and squeeze as much as they can out of a 20 year old platform.  They put themselves first and players last, just look at the recent Todd quote that they like the engine because it’s easy for THEM.  They let modders clean up their messes, and the chickens have finally come home to roost.  Sorry, you mentioned not being English speaker, means the consequences of their actions are catching up with them.
---
Been there a few times but saw no behemoth. Maybe it had been killed those times. After all, there was only a handful of times I checked.  
---
Will keep checking till I find that juicy mf, thanks 
---
Yes your stash box is yours alone but others can use them to access their own loot. 
---
You need 3 certain perks when crafting ammo, 1st  is max lvl scrapper and the second is the perk where you can craft more ammo, third is Super Duper. I can craft 180 rounds for my .50cal and if super duper actives it will give me 260 .50cal ammo. I was always looking to buy ammo off people but then I figured out this method and I've had 1000+ rounds of .50cal ever since, never dropping below the 1000 mark
---
No worries, I appreciate the thought. You keep doing the good work on Xbox and I'll do the same on PC.
---
You are correct on everything except where you log out doesn't matter, if you log out in a building you will be outside of it and everything resets.
---
As far as camp goes, vault 76 and your camp are free to travel to, placement for me is all about saving caps travelling by situating them far apart, but in the beginning just move it with you.
---
Go to your CAMP and make a blueprint of it so you can just lay it down when you move.
---
I'm playing solo pretty much all the time. I've found it fine in all honesty. All the quests I have done solo are easy enough to solo, although it may have been nice to have a friend if only for a bit of company!
---
I haven't done a silo though, although I know it can be done solo. 
---
Played from 0-152 lvl solo, just noticed 2 old buddies from other games played this. I actually prefer soloing. Last time i died i was about lvl 23 i think. A good build and decent weapons gets i throw everything. 
---
Only thing i not soloed is queen. 
---
But after we hung at eachothers camps for couple of hours building stuff one of not got plans for and vice verca. Ofc it has its charm also

Filter down to PA Sets and Fusion cores. Really should only need to keep a few on you unless you are
---
A.)constantly in PA
---
B.)using vats a lot in PA
---
C.)using a jetpack 
---
Hope this helps.
---
How about he leaves it a little vague so we don't get a PA dup happening. We already have enough server instability...
---
*Nuclear Launch detected*
---
Everytime I try to use a nice workshop some no life lazy scum high level POS will one shot me and take it over bsfore I get much use of it.
---
Not much fun.
---
Not anymore. Bethesda removed the fusion core drops from Robobrains in a patch.
---
Use your mic, some people can still understand you even if they don't have a mic.
---
I also use emotes and shooting the bag.
---
If that doesn't work, drop the bag on a table or the counter directly in front of the vendor.  Someone will happen by and take it :)
---
Good to know!  1/3 chance to not die haha
---
There's a 3 star only armor effect that makes you harder to detect while sneaking, but it doesn't list a %.  I've yet to see even 1 low level garbage 3 star armor piece, so good luck getting a max level decent one with that effect.
---
ahh the classic 'Ultracite' surprise! Gets me every time!
---
I’ve played mostly solo. There are times when it’s really difficult, but you can do it all yourself—except for the final boss battle, which becomes a public event and people usually just go to it. 
---
You will hit points where you need to spend time leveling/gearing up before you can do some quests. Nothing stops you from trying, but you’ll come to that conclusion. 
---
The game really is two components—questing with deep stories and lore woven into the environment that is best suited for a solo player, and various side quests and events that are suited toward groups. If they had presented it that way I think the whole thing would be a lot less contentious. 
---
Awesome I'll he on later today once I can put my baby to sleep, go on ahead and look me up GT: xv illuminate 
---
My favorite is running and leaping towards a ledge you can't quite reach (either too high or too far) and then vats meleeing into an enemy. It's always spectacular, even when you fail and fall 1000 feet because the ghoul moved and you lost line of sight for half a second.
---
Same
---
So... does anyone know how long the items remain on/in the corpse?
---
How long do items placed in the cash registers near the vendors remain there?

Perfect leadin for FO5 for me would be

*Player starts to get disoriented, scene suddenly changes to 2 people in Institute labcoats looking down at you through some glass*
---
Tech: Dammit, we have a glitch in the simulation, it's stopped running
---
Tech 2: It's fine, this happens occasionally.  Just do a reboot and initiate the memory wipe protocols, the test subject won't remember this.  And if they do, we can just terminate the subject.
---
Tech: That is how it was under Father.  The new director doesn't look so fondly on that type of behavior now.  
---
Tech 2: Ugh, I keep forgetting.  I get that they want The Institute to be a more open part of the Commonwealth, but it feels like our progress is constantly interrupted by their subjective morality.  Did you know they even let that reporter in here recently to look around and do some type of news story for the people above ground?
---
Tech: I mean, I understand where they are coming from...Vault-Tec experiments would sour anyone's opinion on that sort of thing.  But we are looking at the long term here.
---
Tech 2: Speaking of long term, the simulation is almost rebooted.  I'll start the memory wipe program.
---
Tech: Hope it works, this subject has been a great source of data.  We've almost got a complete psych web profile and have identified multiple sources of behavioral controls.  This should greatly improve the next generation of Synths.
---
Tech 2: We can only hope.  Ok, re-initializing simulation.

You could have bought your TSE yesterday for 500 caps or been given one for free and at level 50, then gone and mowed down all the enemies in whitesprings and made it to level 150.  But yeah they're not the problem.  They're just a major problem.

Some do some dont. Steel is still scrap but copper is ore. Lead also comes in as scrap.

Your car analogy is flawed. If I’m interested in a Toyota you bet your rear bumber I’ll ask dealership of their information. 
---
It’s better to ask real playing players who know the bugs and flaws but play through them and enjoy the game, than troll hateful driven clickbait YouTubers who don’t give a crap about the game to begin with.   
---
There is you problem... Never drop
---
Trying to start a new character has the same problem: immediate disconnect on game load.
---
I'm completely stymied.
---
Weird thing is, I just found out the game works fine on an old spare PC I have with a 680, but not on my main gaming rig with a 2080.
---
I dream to make a creepy stuffed bear room for crafting! Fingers crossed we can decorate in a future update
---
It's the PTT.  And I still thank god it was added.   Open mic is a blight on society.
---
Yeah its much quieter, but now I dont have to hear the heavy breathing, clack clack clack clack of someones loud keyboard, the damn show they are watching in the background, or the game I am already hearing through my game, but now the echo.
---
Quite it nice... and yes I do still use my mic, but only when I need to chat.
---
Same but my game freezes and I get this annoying sound until I close the game.
---
I usually log off one of two places, either my camp, or if I've hit my sell limit but I have more to sell, I'll log off near a vendor so that I'm close by on the next day (real life day) when the vendor resets its caps.
---
You can move your camp, but it costs caps each time you do it. Also when you do move it, all the items get slapped into the "storage" column of your base-edit interface. They are in blueprint-style blobs you can theoretically place back down, but under the storage heading. Sometimes these blobs of quasi-blueprints cant easily be dropped, so I think you can break them out into them being in storage individually. Then they are easier to re-place.
---
As for stash boxes, only you can get to them. If you open a stash box in someone else's base, or the overseers camp, or near a vendor, youll always be interacting with your own stash. So another player looking in your stash box in your base will see his items, not yours.
---
As for a site with mechanics, I'm not sure. Experience in game and questions here on reddit are good teachers.
---
Scorchbeasts are the #1 thing they need to change, because they are the #1 thing that makes me turn the game off and go do something else. Unbelievably unfun.
---
I refuse to use them...yet. Mostly rp reasons. Partly because they are one more thing to account for in min maxxing that i don't feel like im ready for. 
---
Would love one, on all day. Ingame name is Atlantuim, PSN is the same.

Only improve your strength + mele damage besides not receiving damage by falls

My friend did his first silo alone while i was in his party (xbox) and it seemed not too hard but it took him like 2 hours

What about the "idiots and morons" who bought duped weapons or items in good faith, not knowing it was a product of cheating? Weapons, armor, plans, mods, chems, junk, ammo, etc. 
---
I have dropped a lot of stuff in Flatwoods for the lower level players, and I don't know if they think I am a stalker or what. I might have to do what shutten232 stated

&gt;shutten232 1 point 4 minutes ago 
---
&gt;I throw the objects and start shooting on the floor.
---
&gt;At least it worked for me, curiosity wins
---
Or we have like our roles. I love farming and hoarding guns and ammo but hate farming mats. So we give stuff that the other needs. It makes it easier.  Bought my friends new guns for 10k and they filled my stash with 150 of all mats i need. 
---
Well, I guess that was too easy!

When I first read a simulation theory post, my mind went immediately to Atlas observatory. The theme of the machine being on the verge of possible electronic disruption of Chinese facilities by way of weather manipulation. If you had to disrupt a target as suggested by the Enclave, mayhaps this is it?
---
It has to be a 1 star or higher Legendary. A mob that just says Legendary without a Star does not count. 
---
It is one of the terminals in the Military Wing what counts. 
---
The Enclave Events in Watoga are fairly easy and count.
---
I've found chameleon to get me a lot more sneak attacks, even when enemies are aggro'd.
---
I don't have the mutation (don't want to get ALL weightless armor, there are much better pieces).
---
I use one chameleon armor piece.  That way I have other pieces for life saving, auto stim, etc.
---
Wait! So Fallout 76 is really System Shock 3? 
---
It has 1 leg at best.
---
But the events spawn legendaries, have a chance to reward legendaries, and give you the fast travel expenses back in caps......
---
You do you, but that rationalization makes no sense.
---
I have the ultracite explosive vents plan! 😒
---
Try reading your post again if you're that surprised about the downvotes.  
---
Try being kind yourself before asking kindness from others.
---
Did you complete the responders quest and get the inoculation? Seems there is a 'hidden' damage reduction if you do.
---
Railway rifle does not benefit from rifleman perks. I checked  heavy gunner as well and it had no damage increase either. Is this intentional? 
---
Also I experienced what appeared to be the infamous damage/health regen bug when using the salvaged assaultron head  recently. Only occurred on multi-charge shots (2+ charges). Single charge shots seemed normal. I can try to get  a video clip of this later today. Might even have one already.
---
Indeed. I constantly place items in containers at train stations.
---
That's where the "should" in my comment fits.
---
Retail stores.
---
I was in your position, noticing that it was on sale but being unsure, but I've been a fan of the series since FO3 anyway so I thought I'd take the plunge. Tld;r at the bottom.
---
I think that a lot of the concerns people list are very valid. The game is still full of bugs, but I rarely run into any game-breaking problems. This could be because of my hardware, my PC is mid-high tier in terms of parts so actually running the game doesn't present any issues. I've also found that there is no explicit incentive for working together with others, thiugh there are shareable buffs and such, but your experience can get dry if you only play solo. You'll be following a lot of readcrumbs from place to place, returning to your base to improve it or move it, and then going back out to find more stuff which can be a lot of fun if you're into that. However some would argue that giving your money to a company that's had a lot of PR mistakes and poor decisions surrounding the game, let alone releasing the game in the state it was in (and for the mpst part still is) and I think that's a completely valid choice here. Bethesda made a lot of mistakes on this one and the game has yet to pull itself together.
---
Tl;dr I bought it for half off, and without accounting for bad PR or the unpolished nature of the game, I still think it is large enough and has enough to experience that I've got my money's worth. Buying it on sale is the only way I would recommend playing at this point for people who aren't sure.
---
Sometimes you need to wait a bit before the legendary item spawns on the corpse. 90% of the time I don;t see anything, I wait 10 seconds and it shows up.
---
&gt; You will hit points where you need to spend time leveling/gearing up before you can do some quests. Nothing stops you from trying, but you’ll come to that conclusion.
---
I'd agree with that. 
---
As you move onto more difficult quests there is a chance for a higher level character to be around raising the spawn level for the enemies.
---
I had to defend my base in the Ash Heap at level 27 -vs- a large horde of lvl 68ish Super Mutant Warlords that took a dislike to my building sensibilities. That or my generator questioned their lineage.

How do you throw a bunch of Stims or a weapon...

Do you happen to know how to contact the developers?

Maybe we can collect threads or start a petition and link it for them to view 
---
After doing quite a few whitesprings nukes and trash/selling 100's of legendaries and never finding a single 2 shot or explosive weapon, I'm pretty certain all these people on Reddit selling literally pages of tse weapons are duped. 
---
I don't think it's impossible to find 1 or maybe 2 out of luck but seriously these players have 1 of every weapon type for sale. So I agree it's likely 99% are duped.
---
I won't even buy them from people because you may get hit with the ban hammer at some point. After Beth gave those guys perma bans right out, no temp ban, nothing. They may 'accidentaly' target purchasers of duped items in the crossfire. I don't think it's worth the risk personally.
---
Certain events, including claiming a public workshop automatically place you in PvP mode.
---
Also I have the mutation,  as well as a couple pieces of Chameleon armor, and even friends &amp; team mates cannot see me or find me, on the map when I'm not moving, but if they get close enough, the offer to trade thing will give you away.
---
So if they went with your example as is, that'd be 8 within the first hour, after which you could hop servers and repeat.  Which overall would be better than it was prenerf.  Yep, not happening.
---
Dude don't blame the game for your mistake, you dropped it. That's your own fault.
---
I am sorry but all have been warned about duping 100 times over in the same place they are buying and trading stuff from. I have no sympathy if they couldn’t wait 30 days until the fix and end up losing said items. In all honesty the best thing Bethesda could do right now is a full game reset once they discover how to stop the duping and do exploits but too many people will whine about wasted their wasted time. 
---
Wait till level 50 to do quests. The rewards scale up with you. 
---
The easiest way to farm them if you have a Decon Shower is to go to Toxic Valley.
---
Make sure you're away from any enemy spawns, and near some radiation stem vents.  Drop your base with your decon shower down.
---
Farm mutations until you have 3-5 of the ones you want (3 if you're only going for 3-8 mutations, 5 if you're going for 9+ mutations............because if you try to farm too many, you'll get ones you don't want).
---
Buy the rest via serums on FO76 Bazzar or FO76 market trade reddits.
---
Equip Starched Genes and Class Freak.
---
Enjoy your mutations forever (btw never ever ever take off Starched Genes).
---
Or just make no weapons stack in inventory or anywhere

Its def getting worse. I went from 1 crash a day to 3 per now. Last night I blue screened (ps4) 3 times in 20 mins.

Be careful with bags, sometimes the server eats them. Safest bet is to drop 1 item you dont care about (maybe a single bullet of a type you dont use) and then back away. If the server doesnt eat the bag, then use the transfer interface to place other items in it.
---
Another way I leave items is, if I see lowbies near Flatwood, I'll drop excess items in the med kit outside the church, OR the one inside the church. The items persist for some time, and people are learning to look there for hand-me-downs.
---
I love my leather! And if it gets to hairy out here ... just hop into the T-60 and go to town!
---
Wave.  Once you have their attention, drop the bag.  Use Follow Me if you have to.  Then when they see the bag, Thumbs Up.  Sometimes I carry the Party Hat on me to look like some kind of greeter.  If they don't wave back, and seem more interested in getting away, let them.
---
As has been suggested numerous times, we really need different kinds of bags - at least something that clearly reads as "This is a gift."
---
I played it on xbox lol, and it was fixed(I played the xbox only beta)

I built a porta potty outside my house near the overseer's camp and placed a tuba in it using the rug glitch. It's a bit juvenile (and you'll need someone else to close the door), but I get a good laugh whenever a random player comes investigating.
---
I've only been having this happen as of the latest patch, and since I usually get workshops going it's been frustrating. I've had it twice now where I've restarted the power plant exclusively for fusion core generation and it's disconnected me before I get one.

You're very confused about what you think of this game. You've put a lot of hours into it, and, mathematically, have enjoyed roughly 75-90% of those hours. Seems to me it's both playable and enjoyable. I, for one, am having a great time and have been doing so since the very first beta session.

Not if there was actually some balance across the board.
---
I will definitely post my camp, complete with a floor plan as soon as I have time to finish it. I believe it will be worthy...
---
Never keep excess crap junk like bone and concrete. Less used junk keep between 30 to 50 for as needed to low use basis. High use keep at 100 or more. Rare keep as much as possible within a certain amount.
---
Process ore or just toss it. Rid of extra bobby pins since they weigh as much as ship anchors.
---
Extra pland and recipes weigh in excess so give them away or burry them in the dirt and forget about them like a squirrel. 
---
Aid items can be heavy, keep high, high value items.
---
Ammo gets heavy fast, keep reserve ammo for use and friend use, toss what you don't ever pr havent used in a long time or can be crafted super quick.
---
Always check stash at vendor to sell any excess liggering kah kah from the bowl.
---
i wish i knew this earlier... you should crosspost this in r/fo76FilthyCasuals. i know it would be appreciated.
---
A few things:
---
1. I'm level 109 and have yet to get an explosive weapon of any variety.
---
2. The fact that we know about them (and can objectively confirm their existence) means that they are dropping, so I'm not sure what "fix" you'd like. One that specifically makes them drop for you?
---
3. As far as I'm aware, there aren't any mythic deathclaws in 76, but I could be wrong.
---
4. Mythic deathclaws were previously (FO4) the highest variety of deathclaw that couldn't be legendary.
---
5. I've never seen "nuts" or "nuts and screws" as lootable items. Variations of screws, sure, but never anything about nuts. 
---
It seems peculiar to me that a fan of the game would bother to mention an item that doesn't exist in the game when describing the loot they got from an enemy that doesn't exist in the game.
---
I think I have a pair in my stash I'd sell, 1k for both.

Even if your life would be simulation, the fact that you would be in a simulation playing a simulation of being in a simulation would made you one of the most consequent and consistent people out there, and I favor personal consistency over actual existence.

My character, Curie, is a skilled engineer and architect who loves creating more than anything. She's a strong gun control activist so she only uses melee weapons. She enjoys long walks through the wasteland on a never ending hunt for screws and enjoys a little interior decorating in her free time. She's currently in the market for a significant other, but pickings are slim in a post nuclear apocalypse. She's still hopeful tho!
---
I Have two sets. When do you want to trade? 
---
I don't know what to say, it's just bad wording. I enjoy the game, but it can (as in sometimes) be frustrating.
---
Best thing is finding uranium fever. There's a bench right in the event area and just pick up everything any more miner drops. When you're over carry just go scrap all the weapons. I leave with 500+ steel every time. And that's just one person. Have a team of 4 and everyone leaves with 500. It's the fastest way I've found to farm steel by far.
---
I played my first character with my friend and it was only fun when we actually had stuff to do like quests and things like that. Once we were done all of the main story it was a lot of “whatta ya wanna do?” “Idk what do u want to do?” Ever since he got a switch and smash bros and rdr2 for xbox i made a new character and played almost all 101 levels alone except for the times i met some cool wastelanders one in particular that was low level and just following me around then someone dropped a nuke so I decided to team them and chaperone them arond whitesprings knee capping all the bloated ones with a shot gun and letting them get a few hits in before killing them fully so they get xp and loot. Other than that im still making stuff for myself to do and hanging out with random people. Its almost more fun then when I was with my friends.
---
Pharma Finder is the best way I've found.  If you equip it and go to areas with lots of medical / chem containers, you'll find tons.  Make sure you use the SEARCH button, that basically searches the container a 2nd time for more meds.
---
Also you might be low level, and it's normal to be short on stimpacks at lower levels.  I'm up at 120 on my melee character, and even without the Healing Factor mutation (super helpful if you're doing the mutation route), I always am dumping stimpacks on the ground at vendors for people to find.  They weigh too much.
---
I've been wanting to make a mole-man build. Do you go with high agility for action points? Do you take any of the luck perks to refill action points?
---
On topic: Just put 2 sets on my t60. Sorry. 
---
Semi on topic: If you could get ahold of calibrated shocks for her excavator she'd have a total of +200 carry weight. 
---
Wholesome and wonderful! &lt;3 
---
Or have a number per weapon. Thats unique to only that weapon
---
If you aren't going to keep the frame at least take it and scrap it to clear the area for another PA Spawn.
---
Just an observation but empty frames seem to sit around a lot longer.
---
As to the “no warning” bit.
---
Sam Blackwell was on the outs for raising an alarm that the civilian warning system wasn’t synchros properly and the upper echelon of society would get the warning up to several HOURS before the general populace.
---
This is part of why he went full freestates.
---
If you played FO4 it's the exact same stats as the silver shroud costume (at max level). It's for roleplaying so you're not supposed to be able to equip other armors under it just like you couldn't equip anything in FO4. I just wish the game had dialogue options to do with the garb the same way this silver shroud had funny dialogue options in FO4.
---
very cool site, well laid out and responsive. I also like that it breaks down all the stats of the items being sold.
---
My camp is not close to a fissure site, i used to be much closer to a fissure site and never had any scorchbeast attack. right now im right next to pricketts fort and they keep coming

/r/fallout has a lot of neckbeards..
---
They could just make it so that it is either 2shot or explosive but not both and wipe all tse items. Also ban anyone who ever had say 5+ tse items.
---
I have a the pump shotgun that I farmed days for to get. They are possible to find, just rare.
---
de rien :)
---
200+ hours mostly solo here. Once I passed max level and scored a few legendaries, the game became easy. But this description fits most BGS games.
---
That still would not fix the problem
---
I have to agree with op on this one. It's bulls hit playing a game and grinding for people to use exploits and do the equivalent of cheating. 
---
You can do it for me :)
---
Whitesprings nuke zones.  Don't spend expensive shotgun bullets on the enemy.  Grab something cheap like a 10mm pistol or .38 pistol.  Tag every enemy one time.  Follow around the high level players, and just keep hitting everything once.  You don't need to kill them, and you get Full XP and loot from every corpse.
---
Understand your point yes. But how does it affecft you ? Why care if someone has a duped op weapon ? Yes they may 1shot enemies before u get xp and so on...but in all these type of games and real life also  u have to learn to share. I just hop server if a place is crowded. Its not just about you.
---
Even if some ppl score those best guns as drops there are many ppl who NEVER would see a god role if not buying one. 
---
Yeah like i dont undestand in fallout 4 you would always get tge correct item but here you have a chance of not getting it. 
---
My favorite part is the body vaporizes and you have no discernable location to loot it's just gone, no meat/ash/goo pile. I read somewhere bodies disappear when to make room for others or sonething like that so the floor isn't littered with meat piles etc, but this was a super mutant band out in the middle of nowhere. Like c'mon. 
---
\- Only store weapons and armor at Max Level (45 - 50). 
---
\- Store power armor on a frame as it always weighs 10 lbs. 
---
\- Cap your junk resources around a 100 + 5 Bulk each. That's already a lot of surplus, you will rarely need so much junk. Sell or dump the rest.
---
\- Don't store consumables, or be prepared to dump them when not needed.
---
\- Watch your Gunpowder and Ore stores, they can creep up on you and fill your stash and inventory.  I suggest you keep crafting whatever ammo or junk you need as you can, ammo can weigh less than the resources used to produce it.
---
\- Watch your aid / food. Some consumables, meat and veggies, can weigh quite a bit. Figure out what buffs you want from your food and then stock only that food and water. That helps simplify the mental load of having to keep track of food weight.
---
I got to Level...I don't know, 80-ish?...by playing mostly solo.  Lately I've been playing more with a couple of other players.  I prefer solo most of the time, but it *is* nice to run into friendly players and be able to help each other.
---
i definitely enjoy taking my time. I like to explore the area and read everything i come across. I have been doing the questline though and am at fort defiance has fallen at level 36. I would like to get a better ranged weapon though. I'm pretty decent with melee but severely lack in the ranged department. 
---
I don't want to be crazy op or anything, it's just much easier to enjoy the story and exploring when i am not scared to death to explore, lol
---
I end up in a river every time -.- 
---
Male vault dwellers be like 
---
„gurl, you make my broadsider *furious* and *exploding*“
---
In addition to jumping around and emoting to get their attention, grab a mining helmet and put the spotlight on the bag, while pointing your weapon at it.
---
Here is my response from an earlier post with the same question, hope it helps.
---
You can farm any of the low level areas that have a lot of mobs (Morgantown Railyard, Airport, High School) Grafton Dam, Eastern Pen, AVR Medical Center, DMV building.  Take their weapons, scrap for steel.
---
If you are a higher level you can farm tin can traps which give 9 cans a piece which is 9 lead and 18 steel.
---
I am sure there are others I am forgetting but those should get you off to a good start. You can also tag steel in your junk menu and go fill in points on the map you don't have or go back through old ones grabbing and scrapping anything metal along the way.
---
That of course assuming you are at full health with no rads. 
---
It’s a tricky mechanic to perfect. 
---
Or Vlad and Mira. Two robots stuck in a conversation loop. It's really funny. 
---

Pied Piper Bot is my fave! 
---
Start a new character, then check back on your bugged character.
---
Kill people during the Watoga Highschool Monster Mash event and you'll learn just how many russians are actually playing the game.
---
Where did you end up finding this?  I’d pay a guide a hefty premium to bring me to the location.  I want to see it in game!  I’m on XB1.  Tag is denstreifen. 
---
I believe that will kill most of the duping...
---
Bug that's been in every fallout since 3
---
The excavator PA is pretty bad for radiation protection, right? Are people using radiation perks in nuke zones? I'm using X01 armor for nuke zones currently.
---
BEHOLD!  My stuff!
---
I dont think Bethesda knows what either of those things means
---
Literally anywhere. Spend 10 minutes going through a town or city in game, and you’re pretty much set. 
---
Makes you a Jedi, they just haven't added the force meter mod for the Pip Boy yet
---
Awesome. Will do right when I get home. Multiple people have said this so I think this is my best bet
---
No you did not. You duped all those maps. This same thing happened to my friend, except he duped all of em.
---
Or you could work with a hidden ID type system. Multiples of the same ID picked up within a given amount of time within a players inventory would be automatically deleted. Each player already has an ID (gamertag). Honestly it'd only take a day or 2 with 2 coders. But I'd do a team of 4 and give it a week. That way the can work out the bugs (for the first time lol)
---
I have ran into ONE person in this game willing to talk friends with him now. Most people just party up and won't talk or mute themselves.
---
People avoid, run away, or shoot on sight. 
---
Love all this player interaction. Thank God events are a thing or I would literally never see another soul except for the occasional level 70-120 guy in x-01 power.
---
Yah wish they would fix this
---
The Responder as one exits the Vault. Cash registers near vendors. Suitcases near vendors if no cash register. Overseer' chests.
---
Can't believe they didn't create a gift emote yet
---
Based on your system, everyone will be able to purchase custom-made, three slotted weapons and armor from player vendors that started the game from day one and farmed the hell out of the Scorched Earth event, or whatever event has a chance to drop your premium plans.  
---
Every time I see Patrol Duty pop up, there's always a dozen 100+ lvl in power armor annihilating everything in hopes of the handmade plans.  Uranium Fever is similar in that every stealth build on the server is hunting for shielded raider underarmor plans.
---
It would be cool short-term, but totally game breaking after a couple years when player vendors have the ability to craft and sell three star legendary gear.
---
Look at DDO for how power scaling works in an MMO that's been around for probably 15 years.  They had to introduce a new difficulty scale to take into account for the players that had all the best gear and a maxed out character with dozens of reincarnations and full tomes, each adding to the base power and stats.  It got to the point when I was playing that new players couldn't even take on the newer quests on normal difficulty with substandard gear, because the power scale was fixed around players with multiple reincarnations with unique gear for the level just steamrolling through elite difficulty solo.  You basically had to be gifted gear from your guildies and conform to a build pattern in order not to struggle through quests when starting out.  Coming into the game fresh and new, it's basically impossible after level 10.
---
Combat armor is evenly distributed between DR/ER.  Without mutations, if you want them balanced, this is what i'd go for.  I use metal which has higher DR but lower ER.  This works if you have mutations for extra ER or like me, I don't worry about ER currently as most everything is physical damage.   
---
Power armor is very useful for high radiation situations.  Nothing will match the hidden bonus to radiation resistance you get in power armor except the radiation suit with 0 DR/ER.  My friend uses a radiation suit, with no armor on.  He's melee.  He just uses perks for DR/ER resist and damage reduction like Blocker in str, Dodger in agi, things like that.  It's very viable.
---
You can put pocketed mods on armor too, to make up for a lot of the carry weight.  I think i'm 290 with armor on and 340 with power armor.
---
Also I use a padded mod on my chest to reduce explosion damage which I don't think you can even do in power armor.  Maybe there's something built in to it but I feel like i take a lot less explosive damage in regular armor.
---
Ultimately, I carry my power armor with me and use it as needed.  This reduces fusion core drain.  
---
I got you guys! I'm including this feedback in my report. :) Thanks for playing!
---
Got an Exterminator’s (with +50% limb damage) MFing Rolling Pin off the SBQ last night. 
---
Yeah. Not a good run. 
---
Huh, I've yet to see one. I did get a crappy legendary from a glowing wendigo once. It could have been a bug, though. 
---
If you like to explore, solo. If you want to level, group. I would take my time leveling though as another response shows the challenge kind of goes away at high level. I have good power armor and a decent 1 star weapon and nothing outside of an exploding robot has killed me in 75 levels or so. With a group you can easily get to god mode in a couple days. For some people that is more fun, explore and do content without much risk. For others like me I like when the risk of death makes me think things through and be careful. It changes the way you play, I was a skittish mouse in the beginning sneaking and killing and running and now 10 super mutants wailing on me won't stop me from picking this lock real quick.
---
That would take a lot more work to do and probably would take months to code and implement. I was just throwing a quicker fix there way.
---
There is a mythic death claw its at that place that looks like a skull cave just near the pumpkin house go check it out and woopi di doo im done with this game im eso all the way now way better made fallout should of stayed offline simples
---
It... just... works!!!
---
hah! i'm still running around with my level 5 sommerset special as my main ranged at level 36. I really wish i could find a good replacement but i'm having a tough time. 
---
You know the main reason there are mobs at whitesprings is because people leave the lobby, and join back in again, which respawns all the enemies in the area as the game registers it as a new player joining the game. 
---
Lol “cheat”
---
I don't doubt that at all.  I am just saying that I think the majority of people using TSE items bought them from dupers, whether knowingly or not. 
---
They need to lower the price to take one over i thonk.
---
I do the "Come here" signal and point down with my gun towards the floor and most usually see it.

 &gt; I got you guys! I'm including this feedback in my report. :) Thanks for playing!
---
Not really, people dupe by dropping items on the ground or in a container for a friend, they can just simply drop a item, have a friend pick it up, then you can keep dropping items. 
---
Angel Dust was admitted into the vault due to his super human capabilities in creating mind altering drugs out of fairly simple every day chemicals. 
---
His most noted achievement however is the ability to make a drug that blocks your pleasure/desire center. Allowing him to consume, but not become addicted to these chemicals he makes. 
---
Upon exiting the vault he made due with a machete until he found out that his chemicals allowed him to possess super human strength. This off course led him to heavier and heavier weapons. 
---
Now he roams the wasteland on a drug fueled rampage against the scorch, launching bullets across the fields of nuclear glory from his gatling gun, screaming manical laughs as the body parts fly into the air...occasionally crying though... because he gets low... and needs more drugs to numb the pain. 
---
Fucking hell you guys are reaching so far
---
I've been frustrated by a thing or two, as well. But, it's still A) another fallout title, of which I'm a massive fan and B) a multi-player fallout, for which I was and am still incredibly excited 
---
Dude, stop playing. I'm on Xbox, too, and honestly, why put yourself through this.
---
I'm going to probably play again later in the year once the game is (hopefully) functional. You won't be missing much aside from a lot of frustration.
---
Mine is a union soldier or wants to be one he was inducted to the vault and loved history but kept it hidden as he was pretty fit. Inside the vault he worked as a security guard and most people liked him. Once the vault opened he wandered out to the savage divide trying to find his favorite childhood memories. Prickett fort and The civil war museum, Once he got there he discovered that the black powder weapons were real! From that day forth he wandered the wasteland with a union uniform and his gas mask aswell as that he came across a union soldier hat. He walks around singing "The Battle of New Orleans" By Johnny Horton and fighting the evils of the wasteland. For some reason though he heard about the minutemen rising up and disliked it. He mainly hates the brotherhood and enclave. Everything else he doesn't mind. His name now is General Stan T. Williams
---
No I bought all of them.  The people I bought from may have duped them but I bought them all on the trading reddit.  In my recent posts from last week you can see I made a lot of posts about buying maps and I even deleted some of the posts.  Do you know if your friend figured out a way to fix it?
---
Really? I usually get screws and acid from glowing wendigos. But other than that they're not the best. I've only had 1 drop a legendary weapon so I guess it could have been a glitch. 
---
Right directional is stim. Left is swap to last equipped weapon.
---
Have you tried this recently since the last patch? Equipping the suit and marine outfit under that?
---
The idea of a modded multi-platform online-only “games as a service”-game would put Bethesda in a biiig predicament…
---
First off, they would need to greatly restrict what kinds of mods are available. Imagine if modders were to add every item of the Atomic Shop into the game for free, or a Gatling Gun that shoots Mini Nukes. What if faulty or malicious coding would compromise the security of our accounts?
---
I'm afraid we might - at best - get a very limited list of curated (and mostly cosmetical) mods via Creation Club…
---
Next, they would have to introduce some kind of “World List”. This step alone would be a huge undertaking and would conflict with a myriad of the game's core mechanics. Not to mention that Todd Howard, when presenting the game, said that they didn't like the idea of players having to pick servers. [Citation needed.]
---
Keep in mind that FO76 was always supposed to be a “game as a service” - and let's face it, the goal of these games is to provide a continuous stream of revenue. Giving players total control by means of free private servers would be diametrically opposed to that.
---
So, unless they revoke that decision and introduce some kind of “offline mode” (which would be bad business), a fully modable FO76 unfortunately ain't gonna happen...
---
If you have painted pieces, you can never tale the off nor renter the power armour suit, making it permanently in the world
---
Whitesprings.  Grab a cheap 10mm or .38 pistol and 1 hit everything.  You get XP and loot even if someone else kills them.  If you have problems 1 hitting the mobs at the golf club (there are a lot) bring some nades.  Frag, cryo, plasma, doesn't matter.  The AOE damage 1 hits everything for you.
---
Profit :)
---
The up side is that you can swap cards out for different balance, I don't always want my explosives to do 100% (5 perk points) more damage, sometimes 20% (1 perk point) more is just right.
---
For that to happen they have to craft a certain amount of weapons and have them in a stack. If they can’t stack those weapons in a stack...or place a stack of weapons in a container. Then it would stop 99% of dupers.
---
Is writing and linking jessbethesda a way to notify a developer of Bethesda to a bug?
---
It all goes away in like just 400 rounds
---
I am amazed I haven't been attacked more.  Because I totally get that.
---
I think it's less about planning, and more about panicking and that's the only thing I can think of doing.
---
I have never duped and never will.  I try to stay away from it and I have never even been interested enough to figure out how to do it.
---
I can't remember where exactly it was, but there was a UFO looking object that was crash landed that wasn't a designated location and no loot or searchable areas on it (that I was able to find). Was that a random encounter or a legit undocumented location?
---
Me and my buddy normally play around 6-9pm pst. And also on the weekends :) he has a huge fallout group on Facebook that he admins for so we normally play with a few different people. You are more than welcome to join in for some wasteland adventures :) Also we are planning on dropping a nuke this weekend if you're interested :) my gt is Rickyjameson. Feel free to add me and will send you one back when I'm online.
---
That can be said about nearly every Fallout, or for most Bethesda games for that matter
---
Hmm...I am experiencing damage from invisible ghouls at least until they 'load in'.
---
Starting launch preparations. Nuke in a few min!!
---
That would take creating tools. Creating a code. Creating a system that ids all items and then putting that into the game and on servers. That would be a 3-4 month job with a team of 10-20 coders.
---
It doesn't matter if the weapons you craft dont stack, and like I said, you could still dupe items if you didnt place a stack in a container
---
I earned my TSE Gauss the hard way... dozens and dozens of nuked Whitesprings adventures! I did however buy my Instigating and Furious Super Sledge and Grog axe but I'm pretty sure they were not duped. I have no way of knowing but the gents I got them from were also buying plans and such from me so I assume they weren't dupers but you never know these days.
---
Yeah they are. They add up like pennies though. 10 here and 20 there consistently five or six times a day adds up.
---
I had this guy on one of the first days who decided he was 3 Dog, he had some terrible rap music going in the background that was all distorted and he would just follow people around and talk about what they were doing. Thought he was doing a service I guess.
---
Basically this. They can find who is abusing, they also need to remove all tse weapons and make it one or the other and ban anyone with several tse weapons. I mean even if you didn't duped them you knew what you were doing when you acquired 5 or more tse weapons. Unless you were a lvl 3 oblivious noob who found a golden trash can. 
---
All good, not like I had anything else to do while my textbooks finished processing payment
---
Would love see cateye come back back or some food item that grants night vision (wolf ribs in far harbor did this)
---
OK so what fixed my problem was rebooting my PC, something I last did ... who knows how many weeks ago.
---
WTF
---
Have you ever played rainbow 6 siege? 
---
I haven’t touched fo76 yet but R6S has a ridonkulous amount of bugs and glitches 
---
Obviously op didn’t do this on purpose. Doesn’t look duplicatable, more like a glitch. 
---
My wife and I played together since the B.E.T.A, she has since given up and moved to AC Odyssey, and she didn't have nearly as many crashes or server drops as I did. Not sure if it has anything to do with her first gen PS4 vs my slim. However, when ever we played together after fast travel or going into an instance her character would disappear leaving nothing but her floating name. You cant interact, trade, or even revive (which was the main issue). I haven't done any of the power plants but yeah it sucks.
---
You got a better word for it?
---
I guess being lazy is a different way to look at it.
---
Either way you're getting answers to something that you didn't have to put the effort in yourself.
---
No different than taking a test in school and somebody handing you the answers, it's called cheating.
---
I found a full set of lvl 45 raider PA just sitting near the lookout just west of Whitespring, no disembodied voice when I took it though
---
Go to the Blackwater Mine - kill all the mole miners and scrap their shotguns and various loot. You’ll be surprised how much steel you walk away with. For an added bonus equip the “Scapper” perk card before you start breaking everything down. 
---
i can't tell you how many times i've killed myself because I forgot I had my explosive shotty equipped LOL!!! I try my best to keep the melee in hand at all times instead and then switch if i have enough room to not die from my own fire.
---
I met a guy last night that after I told him I had never found any legendary rifle worth anything he showed me his arsenal of over 3 tse weapons he bought from Reddit forums and was 💯 certain they were duped.
---
PC 
---
What about loot? That would make it impossible to pick up a ton of weapons from enemies to learn mods or sell them at a vendor for caps. If I kill a bunch of mole miners, and can only pick up one gauntlet, one shotgun, or one missile launcher, the rest of the loot is supposed to just chill on the floor without me being able to pick it up?
---
Also, if a higher level is making weapons for someone to scrap to learn mods, they also aren’t allowed to do that anymore?
---
No. Some actual, practical ore friendly and period appropriate weapons would be cooler than more dumb novelty bullshit.
---
I don't really know. I wear a T-60 mainly because of the looks and it's the PA I first found a full set of calibrate shocks for.
---
I pop a radshield when I go in a Blast zone, or a Rad-X + a diluted (they stack).
---
Someone's salty about something. I'm telling you plenty of us have legitamte Tse weapons. 
---
i uh, made it so i play Enclave radio wherever i go. or Be A Man from Mulan sometimes
---
i was really bored
---
i'm talking about having 3xrank1 cards or 3xrank3 cards. like rifleman/expert rifleman/master rifleman. 
---
My main character is 70 and I feel I rushed too much even though I had 150 hours getting to that point. Have since made 2 other characters (17, 24) and am just happily walking around never fast traveling except to my camp. I'm having a lot more fun literally walking everywhere rather than fast traveling to the next icon. Haven't gone out of food or water and am happily exploring away! Now am considering building a nice camp for each of my characters too. Can easily say I'm gonna be playing whenever I can! 
---
Ok, so everyone should stand back and let you do the events. Then they should drop all loot for you also? Just hop server and do it again. In all games like there is many factors like this. Maybe try buying an offline game?
---
Exactly. I think my first rolling pin I found ever, was 3 star legendary. I mean I really don't remember ever seening an ordinary rolling pin before that. I might have, but I don't remember. I recall two of the effects were even good. However because the baseline damage is so low, even good effects are useless on a thing like that.
---
I was thinking more of just crappy legendy effects, which will make weapon not really worth keeping even when the baseline weapons is good enough.
---
I'm not really disapointed though about any melee, I only have one melee weapon as backup, from the time when explosive weapons could cause all your guns to become glitched and either do little to no damage, and you couldn't kill anything with gun when that glitch came on. So usually I would only care about really superior melee weapons as I could trade them, and as they are rather rare, don't remember seeing any.
---
If you get a good enough Legendary Super Sledge(like a Furious, 40% faster one), the you'll have enough DPH to not need Radicool; however, Ghoulish is a very good damage mitigator(outside of nuke zones while wearing a Hazmat Suit).  At max, any radiation damage heals 1.5 times that much health; this is especially nice with Glowing Pustules(the disease that makes you bleed radiation when hit, as it lets you mitigate damage from enemies that can't normally deal radiation damage.  If used with Sunkissed and during the day, you are pretty much unkillable in PVE.
---
That's without using Ammosmith right?  Use ammosmith and super duper, that'll help out immensely.  Also scrap all weapons.  I have like 4k steel right now.  Any super mutants, mole miners, scorched.. anything that shoots at you.  Take their guns and scrap them.  
---
I'm not sure of a good Iron deposit location but if you can find a good spot for iron deposits, put on some excevator armor and farm it all up, then refine with Super Duper again.
---
I wouldn't say it was a grind at all. I just explored and did a few nuked whitesprings when I saw they were on my server.Events and workshops. There is quite a bit to do outside of questing.  No server hopping or anything. Felt like I got there in 40ish hours.
---
Well I feel like there should be a chance for that to happen, but yeah there is something strange with the legendary monster drops
---
I recently was exploring at the northwest of the map and wandered down toward a home. There was a group of about 5 cats just hanging around then I noticed a fellow explorer on the map right on top of me. I couldn’t catch him visually but saw him only on the map. His name was Fraidy. Fraidy and all the cats were right near the group of houses with all of the dogs. I started to go back to catch Fraidy but then I got booted. 
---
I remember when LoneVaultWanderer had integrity. fuck a support ticket. the game is broken.
---
To be fair, this makes perfect sense. I just always assumed this game would be non-canon because there are very clear liberties taken with the plot and gameplay to allow the game to be what it is. No human surviving, even if they plan to reintroduce more from vaults or travelers from out of Appalachia in the future, is just impossible. Every fallout game shows people surviving in the strangest circumstances - hell, we have a ghoul kid who was trapped in a fridge for 200 years. The fact that EVERYBODY died to anything is unimaginable. In game and in reality, people are way too resilient. They will adapt, hide, or run away
---
Heading your way, thank you
---
Add a weight limit to all world containers like most corpses was someone's idea in another thread. Together that might work, but it would kill the dropping of items into the registers for others that I currently do. 
---
Fucking dupers have to ruin everything. 
---
Didn’t say you couldn’t pick up Multiple I said not to allow the weapons to stack. Also make it where you can’t place multiples in public containers or bags. Meaning in 1 weapon of that type per bag or public container.
---
Yeah I hate doing radx because it suppresses my scaly skin mutation.
---
the bigger issue is the ass-hats that put their camp right there! everyone of them needs to have their camp leveled! I would LOVE to see Bethesda make it impossible to build there... drives me nuts because 90% of the time they aren't even nearby to claim the kills, just lost exp and legendary drops for me.
---
Alright, I'm going to be honest with you: your utterly terrible grammar and spelling makes me question why and how you came up with your estimates of time and your "final solution," if you will. 
---
What languages do you code in? What projects have you worked on that relate to this or other games, specifically dealing with in-game inventory management?
---
I think you're talking out of your ass, and know little to nothing about how to resolve this issue. 
---
Oh yea....for colonel gutsy my strategy is find a friend to hide behind.  Or make sure I have a good melee friend around.  Even a 195 quad gauss rifle barely scratches them
---
would it be possible to list items that you want to exchange for instead of caps on an item? like if id be willing to trade a mutation serum for some stabilized flux?
---
I believe this would kill scrapping multiple weapons. Specially if you are hunting for mods. I would have maybe 5-10 hunting rifles for my second character before I would mass scrap them for mods. 
---
Most world containers do have weight
---
I assume he forgot to bulk his junk to sell it but I didn't ask. 
---
I must be lucky because I have been playing since BETA on PC and the game has only crashed two times on me. I’ve had a few server disconnects, too, but not insufferable. 
---
Yeah I kill myself at least 5 times a night when I use my explosive shotty.  Very dangerous inside buildings, they are! 
---
I have a quad pump that I use as a backup now, so I can easily tell by the number of shells which one I have equipped. 
---
Also, marsupial helps a TON outdoors, because you can jump up and shoot below you and avoid insta-death.
---
That’s for the negativity.
---
I don't want an offline game, I want this game with a healthy loot system and economy. It had so much potential, deralied by the duping.  
---
Interesting, I’ll look out for it the 
---
Honestly SB need alot of work, ever encounter the 'banshee bomber' glitch, where they just machinegun the scream so fast that the bursts start over lapping?
---
Just curious, how can you be a Shotgun/Melee build if you need 3/4 perks for Shotguns alone? Or are you just using rank 1 damage boosting cards?
---
No such thing as a "good youtuber"
---
Keep us updated with your cave camp when it’s built! 
---
Eddie Eagle be like "Always keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to discharge the firearm!"
---
All good, but that sucks that there is no fix
---
NUKE ON THE WAY!!
---
I've seen it oriented both ways in-game as well, I'm assuming to both satisfy and irritate both sides of this silly debate.
---
Heck yeah I’ll send you a message when I’m on later 
---
I've found multiple TSE and many more just 2-shot or just explosive prefix.  On my first day farming WS round level 70 I got an explosive gatling laser and explosive laser pistol in the same day.
---
Ya, but there's no way to know that from simply looking at them
---
Then I suggest spend more than ten minutes at it. If you dedicate a while to just grabbing all the steel junk you can find from all over, you’ll be good for a bit. 
---
Other thing you can do is when you go into servers, message some of the lower level players in it, tell them you’ll trade them stuff for steel. Doesn’t have to be caps. Could be better armor than what they have, grenades, a better gun that you know how to craft. That way you can play and you’ll help out someone else and still get your steel. 
---
Unless it was aluminum and lead, you don't save space bulking. Any savings you see on other junk is due to the plastic being used... My experience is most bulked items weigh the same as unbulked junk. There are a few that actually increase in weight. 
---
Sounds cool. When my friends are on, I do whatever they want, but half the time its just me. When its just me, I have the pattern where I'll sell, scrap, and mess around getting my inventory in order. Then based on my ammo counts, I may snag a base with lead. Then I'll start exploring. This could take the form of simply picking up half a dozen map markers in a new area, or it could take the form of picking one location and just crawling over it with a keen eye while in no hurry. At the end of the day I'll maybe make sure I have food and water, and I may do some wind-down crafting. Thats about it.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
I have been saving the treasure maps till I got over level 50, now I am over level 70 but haven't had time to go after the treasure yet, so at the moment I have 57 maps, and I have never duped or purchased any.
---
Fuckin robots
---
nono, feel free, hell, if you want to do a farming mod I also have a thread dedicated to such on here, I'm always coming up with ideas, and try to share them just so they see the light of day sometime, yanno?
---
The arguing Mr. Handy’s are a reference to Waiting for Godot. 
---
"Ope, just gonna squeeze past you there. My bad."
---
"You're good."
---
what platform? i have a theory that xbox has the most griefers. i'm on pc and have not come across a single hostile/malevolent player
---
They all still way the same weight. They just wouldn’t be in a stack in your inventory 
---
Just run pacifist 24/7 unless you're LOOKING for PVP.
---
Problem solved.
---
Seriously, events and exploring. My HW/PA guy is gaining, not losing cores and he lives in PA (but no VATS). My VATs Sniper burns cores fast in PA but I’m only in it for nuke zones so I’m still gaining cores on her. 
---
It is beyond the point of being acceptable. It has been almost two months since release and it is STILL a problem. To make it worse Bethesda has taken NO STANCE whatsoever on duping or other exploits in regards to bans or other punishment.
---
FIX YO GAME, FOOLS!
---
Only VATS; the sneak bonus is still displayed as double.  It is like F4, not F3 and FNV.  
---
He wasn't supposed to be in vault 76, at least that's what he told himself. The vault was for the best, the boldest, the brightest. He must have gotten lucky and the system glitched out and sent an invitation. Classic case of "not good enough." But it would be foolish to not at least try to get in with an invitation in hand. He also however, believed that if he even told the Mister Handy who admitted him his real name, they would kick him out on the spot. "Hm, that name doesn't appear on the list. Now now, sir you don't belong here" he could already imagine the automaton eyeing him up and down. "off you go then, you might get lucky and find a Pulowski somewhere. Good luck to you!" 
---
So, he would have to make one up. Maybe it was possible there was some fluke in the programming, that he could trick the Mister Handy into letting him in. He wasn't that intelligent, didn't know a thing about troubleshooting a Robco robot.  Maybe he could trick it with wordplay. Repeat what the bot says over and over... No no, that wouldn't work, he would still have to address the robots on the inside, and you can't charm a bot. Maybe he could guess someone else's name. But he wouldn't want to take someone else's spot who could actually help rebuild this great country...
---
The line was getting shorter, people already moving and settling into their new home. It would be his turn soon. He was starting to panic, wasn't able to endure much pressure. Maybe he could push past and make his way inside. He wasn't that agile or fast, but he was big, strong enough to muscle through. But other people were bigger, and obviously stronger. They wouldn't let someone in who wasn't supposed to be there.
---
"Sir? Your name and invitation? Last name first, please. You're holding up the line." He hadn't even realized that he was next, everyone had moved so quickly. He never was that perceptive. Sweating, he stammered "Uh, Flanders... Danders?" He spoke before he could think. Back to word play, and it wasn't even very good. That damn middle eye looked him up and down (like he knew it would) "Identification confirmed. Welcome home, Mr. Danders Flanders" He grinned, he knew it was better to be lucky than good. Looks like he would have to get used to such a stupid name, but at least he was home
---
I'm not looking for it to be layerable with armour Per se (Though, it would be REALLY nice if crouching created a Stealth field)
---
Just that the dress looks awful and that it would be nice to be able to have the same benefits while being the Scarlet Sniper (or others), and being that having those bonuses built in to the Scarlet Sniper would be P2W....
---
There already too much to track on each weapon.  you've got to keep track of the base weapon, configuration of mods, legendary effects, and condition level.  Adding a unique ID to each one would be that much more information to store, which would likely result in us not getting a reasonable stash limit.  A much better solution would be to simply not have weapons stack.
---
Yes yes and yes I’ll message you when I’m on later what’s the gt? Same as username?
---
Man you just made me creep out harder at that MODUS and ZAX conversation on the terminal
---
"Picture this: I'm a bag of dicks. Put me to your lips."
---
How do you get the automatic barrel for Tesla rifle?
---
This is the key: sometimes circumstances dictate different configurations for things in life, and that's OK.
---
Trapper Armour with deep pockets.
---
no clue, honestly there's alot that should be done just to make things more clear, and there are a few 'completely uncraftable' recipees, namely the ones that require thistle.  They don't detect the thistle flowers you harvest in grafton for some fuggin' reason
---
I had one spawn literally out of nowhere. Didn’t ask any questions, just put it in my stash and used it after I broke the pieces I had on me instead of repairing them.
---
I was going to keep both going but that seemed like a waste of screws, so once I broke a piece I dropped it and replaced it. 
---
If you found any broken excavator armour pieces laying around, that was me. 
---
I do the same thing with marsupial lol! Jump, VATS, and shoot!
---
That would convolute the game's code tremendously. Any and all duplicates would have unique IDs, including the generic pipe weapons dropped, all the way out to stimpacks and random leather armor. Additionally, with adding so much information to each character (with their stash and inventory combined), I suspect server stability would be affected. 
---
Yes duping is off. I kind off missunderstood . My humble appologies . I thought u ment that is was wrong that those weapons excist
---
Its the union uniform. 
---
You get good loot.  Weapons, plans, etc.
---
He'll get some scraps (like a few junk, a stimpack, a few caps).
---
I know there are hypothetical ants I have seen their corpses I'm level 78 now and still have yet to knowingly kill one. I get grenade happy in mines.  So maybe one was there 
---
I've had plenty if TSE's drop, they've just been shittier weapon types (.38, laser, hunting rifle, etc.).
---

Why do people change servers?
---
Let me know when you are on, GT That Bluesman
---
See thats the thing, I bought maps from 10-20 people that were just like you but instead of doing the maps they just sold them to me. 
---
I had way to many and may have ruined my character
---
I give away 200 ballistic fiber and 100 stimpacks, then log in to see this guy talking about what a duping prick I am :P
---
&gt;I've found multiple TSE and many more just 2-shot or just explosive prefix. 
---
I wasn't aware there were 1 star explosive items. 
---
It's my understanding that explosive weps are always 2+ stars. 
---
Just get rid of the dropped bags.
---
next week on bug or feature 
---
I think about that during the in-game character creation process. Like in FO3, where you are following your dad to a birthday party. Or FO4, where you spend a mundane moment in suburbia. Or FNV, where you have a long talk with Doc.
---
This game has nothing like that, just an empty vault, so my character is my FO4 character, a battle-scarred wench who trusts no one while trying to rebuild  the wasteland, except there's nothing to rebuild, there's only mobs of power-armored  goons with warhammers, nuking the same ground over and over again so they can feed like vampires off the ultracite or whatever the fuck they want so much.
---
It's not much of an rpg at all, it's crap PvP because of dupers, hacked loadouts, and two-shot explosive kill weapons.
---
Of course they can.   There is a difference between "legal" abs "allowable in the terms of service. "  But it's also worthwhile to be aware of what is actually being sold in either case. 
---
I know right?! Just few days ago I fired up ol' Fallout 4 where I have the automatic silenced handmade rifle that increases damage on consecutive hits and it was amazing!!!!!!!! I don't even care if it's the best or the worst gun in the game, it just sounds and feels so god damn satisfying.
---
I had that today. Usually now I can easily one on one a SB, but this one did not stop screaming, over and over. Couldn't line up a shot and used a ton of stims. Even when it landed it was just wall to wall screeching. 
---
Works for me, my name on PC is Britemac, we can try to do the trade tonite, but to note it won't be any sooner than 11ish hours from now
---
The 'main' bonus power armor gives honestly is that being in the frame, much like putting on a hazmat suit, halves incoming radiation before resistances are applied.  At least imo, that's the main point of it, as it's the only way to survive ultra high rad zones without being basically naked armor wise
---
I had a college professor last year who had an entire lecture on this and seemed to believe it.
---
I like looking at it as being lazy or just wanting to use your time more efficiently, especially for those of us working full time with only a few hours a day to play. I see it as a bit different than being handed the answers to a test in real life because that’s, you know, real life and this is just a game meant to have fun. So what if I don’t want to waste an hour of my time scrounging up all 8 pieces and then having to decode it all when it’s a totally unnecessary step in the process of launching the nuke? I’m not negatively impacting anyone else by doing so and the only benefit is being able to launch the nuke a lot sooner, which benefits everyone in the server 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Thanks to all for the great responses.
---
Grognak’s axe and the super sledge have the same stats far as I can tell. 
---
It's perfectly fine playing solo, however you will most likely encounter people and become friends. I've made quite a few friends from random encounters. 
---
For me I have a high chance of getting a repeat error type of crash (where it gets stuck on a sound that loops) when I'm in my pipboy or selling to a vendor. Extra high chance at the free states vendor.
---
Can bb located at Philippi Battlefield Cemetery
---
downvoted on your cake day?  terrible.  these are the same people who put the roll on backwards!
---
what? "learn to share by letting them have everything." That is some funky logic.
---
It would be a. I’ve add in an update if it’s. It nodded in when Creation Kit is released. 
---
Just be me and scrap all your Hardened Mass as a reflex haha   *cries inside 
---
WEEEEEWOOOOOWEEEEEWOOOOO
---
It’s a good way to curve and slow down mass duping..
---
You also have a trade option to give people stuff through and you can drop the price to 0. Also it is for weapons only.
---
The armor is idea for my explosives-leveled engineer character.  He can carry a SHIT-TON of things that go boom and party all night.  Had to put a camp on a nuclear material deposit to keep him stocked on Mini Nukes.
---
Is that why when you launch a nuke the game crashes, because you broke the simulation?
---
Character wipes are a massively selfish and hamfisted solution that only people who didn't farm their weapons for days then spend the same time trading for their build.  I can't believe you would suggest people's displeasure at that odious idea is foolish.
---
...you should?
---
How about we just up the chances of finding said items people are duping.  Oh and players should stop looking to buy said items.  Remove the incentive.  Tweak the damage taken by scorchbeasts.  Because most people are using TSE weapons for weapon damage as normal weapons just suck.  
---
That's my fear lol
---
It's just a nice save on stims at times. I do also run the maxed out Photosynthesis and rad Regen cards for daytime as well. So my bases are generally pretty well covered.
---
I do like the game, but there is a lack of endgame content so do not rush into the last levels etc it does get tedious unless you make a new character 
---
Good idea also
---
Oh shit, I remember finding the tank surrounded by robots. I was wondering why I could never find it again on that same road! I do love how many small details are in here, I've seen some of these but others like the arguing handies I've never heard of
---
How did you lose? Lvl 232 having fun with my friends and couldn't give a fuck who else has TSE.
---
Yea, but if being in high radiation zones is basically the entire endgame that's kind of a big deal. 
---
I don't remember how it was in FO3, but for FO4 at least, time would pass when fast travelling, you wouldn't just instantly appear at your destination. Also, for other FO games, you have to go back to previous state if you die, you don't just continue with (almost) all your gear, stats, etc. that you had prior to death.
---
Well yeah, but let's face it a Gatling gun that can shoot mini nukes is straight off cheating, but as we have found many times proper mod makers can actually be better than Bethesda at writing their own game haha. 
---
Yes, the problem of faulty and malicious code is what would create the management hangover, they would have to do the same thing as Google and others and actually have a lengthy vetting process which would last months and require you to present your app (mod in this case) to the company. 
---
Hmm, that quote worries me, while I can understand his comment the idea of not being able to choose a world that's right for me is something I hate right now. 
---
Now boys, when you're in the field fighting those commies and your trusty sidearm jams up on you, remember the old saying "Rack, Tap, Bang!"
---
What's super duper?
---
I had NV and 3 but i treated them like spare time games, FO4 was what truly got me to go back and play them, discover the world and possibilities etc
---
The one N of Prickets Fort and the one S of Crevasse Dam both spawned albino deathclaws, but more than half the time theyre getting f'd by mods when i load in
---
Sure nerf TSE but melee can no longer vats targets. Sound fair?
---
An empty PA chassis also adds 60 resistance to radiation, energy and physical damage.
---
Ayyy lmao I forgot a bout me 3 IT
---
Lol I thought it counted in f4 XD
---
Not really my point. More likedont cry like a little bitch over a game
---
How on earth would that work?
---
"Dear Bethesda, a few weeks ago on an unknown day and time, I paid an amount of caps (I forget how much) to a guy whose name I don't recall for my duped weapon. I want a reimbursement."
---
"Bethesda: sorry, get in line. We have 8 million other requests that are identical to this one. Plus, we need you to prove that you had no idea this weapon or item was duped"
---
Also, what about junk, chems, ammo, and plans? 
---
And there’s a song on the radio, Don’t Fence Me In, but we can’t go past the fences at the border of our pipboy maps. 
---
My exact views
---
My best guess is that maybe in reality Vault 76 is something like the Memory Lane Vault, but this time it isnt a sort of utopia, but a doomsday simulation
---
I have almost exclusively only had good experiences when it comes to other players.   Everyone either ignores you as a chance meeting or teams up temporarily.   
---
One guy griefed me right after beta but whatever.   That's it.   
---
I did slay a wanted guy last night, but he had it coming.   
---
Funny, someone talking about grammar and spelling. You made the first paragraph one sentence.
---
I love how this just works. 
---
that's what i think. i usually only get to play weekends during the morning while everyone in my house is getting ready and whatnot so it's nice. 
---
&gt; But they made some huge improvements to the game.
---
Please list one or any "huge improvements"
---
Well..... who pissed on your cornflakes? Dumb and novelty you say?
---
The ability to shoot 5 or 6 rounds in an arc towards an attacking group, that do an equal amount of damage per shot as the bp pistol, does that sound like a  novelty? 
---
Stop being a debby downer and put the salt back in the kitchen lol.
---
&gt; aware of what is actually being sold in either case.
---
Right. I'm assuming we all know what's really being sold, and that's the caps. 
---
Called "Weightless" armor
---
Which event and did you get the blueprints?
---
Waiting for those myself 
---
I play solo. Rarely do I team up with anyone. I do a lot of exploring and have done a lot of the missions. The only mission that I’ve gotten my butt kicked was to launch a nuke. I figured it was because I was strong enough yet. I’ve enjoyed playing solo. So things on my schedule. 
---
Can you please elaborate a bit on this? 
---
Is it that a new player comes across a musical porta potty (with you inside playing the tuba) and doesn't know what to make of it, or do you trap someone in a porta potty using a tuba that they can't stand up from if the door is shut? Do you lock the door with you inside playing?
---
Could be an absolutely hilarious way to cause people to obtain bounties accidentally (assuming they don't look at the map and see you there): "Oh man, this must be a cool easter egg! A porta potty with music coming out of it? I need to unlock it to find out what's going on in there!"
---
I'm kinda the same, I'll do all those things in no particular order.  I do try to get xp still, b/c I know there are cool cards out there that I could play passively.
---
I may try to run a workshop all day, but that sometimes gets to be a hassle.  
---
I do like nukes for potentially better guns/mods/plans, but I rarely drop one myself due to the hoops they make u jump through.
---
My best days are when I find a wandered, and they need help.
---
I could have used help in the beginning so I do whatever i can.
---
Sometimes I'll just be zoning out walking around and something cool happens.
---
I cant verbalize why i still play other than it's still fun...a no pressure fun thats quite relaxing.
---
Sus
---
Spoilery type question:
---
&gt;!What does this newly materialized holotape say?!&lt;
---
Xbox one, since the beginning if I die I can only respawn in the closest location to my death, no other locations are selectable. I thought this was normal until I was playing on a team and the others got to choose where they respawned.
---
Also &gt;! The last holotape before launching a nuke shows that she's about to die from the mole miner attack. How did she survive, and how was she strong enough to get to the silos and out fast enough? !&lt;
---
There are several reasons, not counting basic reasons such as joining a friend.
---
* Your camp location had a conflict with another player.
---
* You know the vendor at Grafton can sell shadowed leather mods, so you check his items, then switch servers, and check them again.
---
* You are looking for a certain event that is on a timer, so you hop worlds to find one where the event is up.
---
* You are looking for spawn points for things in the game like power armor stations, or barbells with lead, or maybe a certain costume or armor plan that can spawn. Since it didnt spawn on the current server, you switch/
---
I'm sure there are other reasons, but most of them come down to convenience or time-saving.
---
Like others have pointed out, multiple levels of the same perk card can be useful.  Still, it would be nice if we could do something else with extras we can't or don't want to use.
---
The idea of being able to burn them to move SPECIAL points came up in a previous topic.  Maybe burn one to get a respec point, then use a respec point to move a SPECIAL, or use three respec points to choose a new perk card.
---
Tell me about it! Was just doing sbq and I couldn’t get a group, I got disconnected of course and so all my hard work gone. 
---
I was enjoying that aswell 😖

Message “unzombified” on Xbox - I have the app so I can answer even if I’m not playing, but I should be playing later.

Beginning evaluations in the next hour or so. If you think you have what it takes to impress the Wasteland Estates HOA, then we're calling you out. Hit us up on our Twitter.

I know trading is an option, but with how some people at this point still don’t know how to trade, sometimes dropping something is just easier. Everyone does it. 
---
I’m not saying Bethesda shouldn’t fix the duping. It’s pretty out of hand. I’m just pointing out the flaws in what you’re proposing. 
---
Well they should, I think someone at the marketing and customer support team finally got through to the lunkheads that thought terrible customer service was appropriate response to a less than fully prepared launch party. 
---
Melee builds are as OP if not more then TSE.  It the range of the gun and the fact they are the higher dps guns in PVP.
---
Also TSE isn’t very effective against Scorch Beasts they have a huge explosive damage debuff. Anti armor actually better for scorch beast with Prime receivers and Ultracite ammo.
---
 not registers
---
There's also a paracite disease that eats like half your hunger bar every 30 seconds so keep that in mind. 
---
I have a huge farm at my camp. Spawn in with green thumb and you can cook up enough meals to last your journey. While dromedary and slow metabolism are great perks they aren't necessary to have. Salted meats which food spoils slower is also nice but isn't required.

The first "paragraph" *was* one sentence, genius. 
---
Except that in other fallouts time changes so you can rationalize traveling. In this game it really is an instantaneous fast travel. 
---
I have issues as well using two monitors. To fix I go into display and select "only display on" and choose which monitor. 
---
You seem to forget the fastest queen kills come from melee not tse. 
---
I have found those who complain about TSE are normally melee builds. They want to be able to one shot enemies but dont think its fair that they can also be one shot. 
---
My TSE does 961 damage, alot pf melee builds are pushing 2k and can vats teleport. Cant nerf one wothout extremely nerfing the other. 
---
I’ve seen them in game somewhere, so they do exist. I had this same thought and think they should add it, unfortunately it will probably be through the Atom Store -.- 
---
Nah he's just pointing out your lack of self awareness.  Maybe you should stop taking your own advice and lay off the chems a while.
---
Wait, enclave scout armor???
---
I’ve been trying to give away plasma rifle plans for like a week and these kids keep running away from me... ☹️
---
Also shout out to the guy who made and gave me a full set of level 50 ultracite PA while i was AFK
---
I want to say you have until mid January, you’ll need proof of purchase like a receipt and be able to scan or submit a photo with your gamer ID, email and I forget what else on it.  It’s in the help section though. 
---
Its out already. Its shitty but its out
---
It's automatic, stumps disappear if they are in the way etc, you can't level hills or anything...
---
It's available already, it's not a separate feature in the camp but when you place floors it should clear terrain features, to a point
---
Already out.  
---
Put down an object and it will remove small objects from the area.
---
It is and it's wrong. Go back to school, you obviously don't know basic structure.
---
Shielded is best rn though
---
The big hole in these theories is that nothing in the game points to the Bethesda writing team being this innovative and novel.
---
I was answering your question. Also, 5 projectiles in a horizontal arc sounds useless from both a game play perspective as well as the context of weapons available in the lore. 
---
I apologize for not stating my original post in a friendly enough manner. You have to remember, we aren't all European. 
---
ok that certainly wasn't my experience so maybe all the info is wrong. It says 'epic named' or something similar, it's a little hazy in the description certainly but it only appeared to proc on 3 stars for me. 
---
Where did you get shielded? From a vendor or an event/daily?
---
This is literally what ppl are saying ..
---
Same 2 for me. I hope to find a 2 - 3* Instigating Grognak in the future. 
---
It's juuuust out of reach.
---
So, is nobody going to point out the obvious fact that OP is fighting them with a "duped" weapon and the repair bill for that base is obviously exploited due to the sheer volume of materials it will cost to fix it?
---
I feel for you just a smidge, but you obviously exploited or were part of a "dupe party" so why should Bethesda help out?
---
Are you server hopping or have a lot of DIFFERENT items on your person (number of items in a stack doesn't matter if it is 1 or 1M and stash isn't important)?  These seem to be the main factors on the PS4 version outside of nuke zones with all those sound/visuals/ect.
---
I gave away all my plans and recipes and I crashed way less.  God knows how stable the game would become if they added a keyring that only checked the contents of when you tried to open a door.
---
Cheers
---
I think that was the original intent. You gain caps for pvp kills based on level. But you only lose caps if wanted, and the killer gains the normal caps, plus the bounty. The problem is that then it is easily exploitable. Me and my buddy just take turn killing each other and getting caps out of thin air. So they had to implement it as the loser loses the caps that the winner gains. Which sucks when you get into a lengthy altercation with a team of explosive shotgun users, and next thing you know you're down 3,000 caps.
---
Diablo 2 had a very small amount of storage and you just had to deal with it.   Now, Bethesda games are known for hoarding stuff so 76 was a weird new direction, but looking into my gaming past it's not a new concept, I just havent dealt with it in a while.   
---
After adjusting, Im cool with it.   
---
IKR?  I mean I used to play alto sax, they are great, maybe they are just to complicated for how many animations would be needed?  Although....they could just take the Epic Sax Guy performance and make it like that....I think every one could apreciate that.
---
RTJ + DJ Shadow. Never stop never stoppin'.
---
Also, if you do start to accumulate them to any degree make sure you put max points into Batteries Included in the INT tree.  It will make them weigh around .3 each I think.
---
Yep, Xbox!  It's almost everyday now mostly when I'm at White Springs farming... They'll harass me and find my base and destroy it... And they just get a 10 cap bounty
---
Nicely done. I hadn't thought of using ricochet! I'm glad to see someone else trying to break these a holes of their ways 
---
I came for double-etendres
---
I was not disappoint 
---
I would love to not use a tse. Sadly, as others have noted, finding a good weapon that is not TSE is exceedingly difficult since people do not dupe them.
---
Carnivore and herbivore respectively still can be replenished with the other, but the amount it restores is significantly less than if you eat say meat with carnivore etc. 
---
Just use Class Freak. It's just 3 points in luck and actually a must have if you run many mutations anyways. 
---
yes, but in all those languages a single 'typo' can usually be worked around thanks to context clues.
---
In code languages like html, binary, css, xml, c++ etc., a single typo just destroys everything beyond that point or needing the call tag for what you had a typo in
---
There is something very buggy with energy or guns in general. I have both a 'anti-armor explosive assault rifle' and 'anti-armor explosive laser rifle' one does 180 damage, the other 60...can you guess which is which?
---
&gt;! The enclave is behind vault-tec as a plan b. Heres a nice explanation

---
Yes! What a cool way to introduce NPCs.
---
😂😂😂
---
Fair play. 
---
Oohhhh. Didnt know thats what that was. I have used it then, i put my generator over a rock and it disappeared. Still wish you could scrap like in 4. Even just unimportant stuff like cars in the way
---
Or a way to toggle the entrance/exit animations for PA, kinda loses flair after the 50,000,000,000 time doing it
---
i dont even like them but coming by anything else is a task.
---
The fact that you people keep calling the prologue end game is ridiculous
---
Did you make friends with a deathclaw?
---
More or less the tuba sounds like "fart" noises. Had a couple people look around and find the porta. They open it up to find it's just a kind old lady playing the tuba. Toss in some emotes and maybe a small exchange over VOIP and that's all there is to it, no trapping. Like I said, it's juvenile, but I can't help to chuckle.
---
We're probably in an alien simulation, floating around on a mothership out in space or something.
---
Previous Fallout games have implied that the aliens may have had a hand in the Chinese-American nuclear exchange. Possibly by carrying out false flag attacks(real or through tampering with early warning systems). 
---
I found one as well yesterday, I cut the right wire and got the rewards from it, feels good man
---
I just set up 4 of them. I have a fusion generator, so power isn't an issue. 8 purified water every time I return to camp quickly mounts up, when stacked with random pickups
---
I have a full set of each for any newbie friends to use and one day hope to be able to display them :-)
---
It ruins the market especially considering they are about to add player vendors. What is the point if the market is saturated with duped items?  It affects everyone wanting to participate in that part of the game. 
---
Oh yeah my fallout 3 character really took a turn after that one homeless guy by rivet city. I was always a good character but that little interaction changed me. He asked me for water and I gave it to him. I came back sometime later and he was dead. I always asked myself, did I not do enough? I later learned that he could die regardless of your options. While it’s not a matter of life and death and I am a low level (32), I try to help new people as much as possible because I’m that same character from fallout 3 and New Vegas that always tried to do what was best for others. 
---
OP can't imagine a thing as true if he hasn't seen it personally.  Must be a small world.
---
Atom challenges are tied to account though I think. You can't farm visiting all the regions on five different characters
---
That was probably my favorite quest in this game. 
---
There is a spot near Grafton ... don't remember the name but it is a boat launch on the old river.
---
You mean just like how they said it would be during the keynote? The way all other story based RPGs have worked before?
---
added you
---
Agreed! Just tag everything and let everyone share in the loot and xp.
---
In regards to Ghoulish, it's far better than Healing Factor.  While Healing Factor does increase health Regen speed, you don't naturally regen health in combat and even with Photosynthesis, you can still die quite easily if swarmed.  Ghoulish heals you simultaneous to taking damage.    
---
So for example, if you threw a nuke grenade at your feet which would deal 250 Ballistic damage +125 Rad damage, Ghoulish 3 would heal you for 125\*1.5 rounded down, which would be 187.  That 187 would be subtracted from the 250 meaning you only take 63 actual damage and 125 Rad damage.  As long as your health at the time of the grenade going off was more than 63, you'd survive.  It was better in FO4, simply because you could have way more health(1000+) and you could face tank a fat man launched mini nuke and walk it off like nothing happened(kind of makes me want to play FO4 now).
---
Oh and if you have Lone Wanderer the 250 would be reduced by 20% first the reduced by the 187 of healing which results in only 13 damage.  Add in Dodgy and you are just healing 17 health at the cost of 125 Rad damage.
---
However, decently high rad resist renders Ghoulish useless and shouldn't be used with PA unless in a nuke zone, and preferably in a group with someone sharing Rad Sponge.  If the person with Ghoulish 3 is also sharing it, then the entire group is set as long as players don't start attacking them.
---
Yes, on the first level, you are buying caps.
---
But why would anyone buy caps or atoms if you get them in game?  I hover around 3000 caps because I'm a scavver and I know where most of the faction merchants are?
---
It's the same reason why whales will spend 10000 dollars on a shitty mobile game.  It's not because they are ignorant about the intangibility of those goods, or because they are stupid with their money (at least, not most of them).
---
Because they dont want to spend the TIME NECESSARY to get them the long and boring way.  So, on the second level of analysis, they are spending money to buy back some time from somebody else, who spent their OWN time gathering the caps.
---
Its advanced economics.  Something that mobile game companies learned how to abuse for massive profits, and something AAA game companies on other platforms are trying to emulate.
---
On the third level of analysis, whales trade their own time to somebody else (maybe they're a sales person at some big company, a pending time running around landing sales for automated apple pickers) in exchange for money.  That money is then abstract stored time, which can then be exchanged for goods and services other people provide gathered or generated by THEIR time.
---
&gt;servers with PvP totally unlocked
---
&gt; A kill should result in being able to loot that person body, not just the junk but everything
---
No. That's how you open the game up to real griefing. 
---
&gt; I want servers with 64+ people on them who are locked to the server they are on
---
What happens if I want to play with my friends who were added to a different server? Just no.
---
&gt;This essentially turns 76 into more of a long game pvp/BR
---
Go play fortnite.
---
Am I the only one that, upon finding clean toilet paper in the waste land thought it'd be a precious/valuable comodity due to it being purely a creature comfort (I mean, if you s*** in the woods you can use leaves, or if near a river a quick dip and you can clean yourself pretty well)
---
That dude has -1 Perception, obviously. Possibly low Intelligence as well.
---
Let's play Grammar Police, then.
---
This post, to which I'm replying, is grammatically incorrect. You inserted a comma when a semicolon, preferably, or even period should've been used.
---
&gt;Go back to school, you obviously don't know basic structure.
---
It should read as "Go back to school; you obviously don't know basic structure"
---
Additionally, you omitted the word "sentence." *You* knew what point you were trying to convey in your post but your reader may not. Please make the appropriate corrections by using the "edit" function.
---
Thx pumpkin. 
---
Outfits FTW. The Field Scribe outfit I normally equip also has what appears to be a backpack on it. Doesn't actually do anything, though.
---
Yeah it does work how they made it out to look or maybe how they intended at first, maybe they'll improve upon it but atm it works like it has always worked with Workshops 
---
I did, AND RAN!
---
Harness upgrades are Raider underarmor upgrades.
---
Yes because it's the game's fault you made a mistake.
---
An honest mistake, yes. But own your fucking miatake, don't blame the game.
---
Go ahead and uninstal. The other players won't miss you.
---
I've seen that one before lol, I wish I could get the holotape from it though like you could get the Bugle playing tape from that one Eyebot in the robot race in FO4
---
3 star bloodied grognak or super sledge ,+swing speed or +power attack + str i think would be the highest damage 2 hand combo
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mdWYd28iow
---
Cool thank you!
---
Holy shit haha that’s damn minimal. 
---
This is pretty apt, after all, Golf is the only sport that goal of the game is to play less golf
---
No, coming by anything else is easy.  Coming by the exact one you want is a task.  And that's the point of the game.
---
Solo all the way past 100, never teamed up once, it really isn't necessary to get anything done except the Queen, unless you have TSE weapons from luck or a duper....
---
No idea how people enjoy one shoting enemies it would make the game so boring for me. Had a bunch of friends who used to do this a lot and now never play cause It’s boring or nothing’s a challenge I mean i wonder why. But they can play how they like lol doesn’t affect me 
---
Harness falls under raider under armor, so does road leather.  I think military fatigues fall under casual. Categories I recall:  raider, enclave, BoS, casual, vault.  
---
Dumb question, but what does TSE stand for?
---
Wow wow *clap* *clap* *clap* congratulations you have accomplished what almost all players accomplished.
---
Considering the exit/entrace is so bugged. yes.
---
kk, am at work atm so can't really accept it, but will do when home/on
---
 My melee char uses PA and I have too many. I only keep 5 at most and only start grabbing more when I see them if I have 2 or less. Right now 5 in inventory and maybe 20 in stash. The damn things are all over. 
---
Yea it's a joke, it leads you to an area to collect the said leather leg, and the notes state that "the leather right leg is the best armor, and that's why we should join their group." Stuff along that line. It helps new players but is a joke to higher levels because we don't need that weak armor. It's just overly exaggerated how great that armor is.
---
There really needs to be a way to rank down perk cards.
---
Thank you for the great feedback! I'm going to look for Chameleon gear and get Speed Demon so you are 100% correct about not needing LifeGiver, I didn't really think about that. 
---
There is a good chance that they had absolutely no idea what was going on. 
---
They have been datamined I know that much 
---
I found 2 explosive shotguns and while they don't have the "Two-Shot" prefix, they can still 1-shot groups of Whitesprings ghouls to OP's point so anyone else none the wiser would think "TSE" even though it's just "E".
---
The real questions are, how often are people actually using explosive weapons without that rarest of rare combo TS+E and isn't it really the explosive prefix that's the source of angst?
---
Oh and one other run I’ve been doing lately, the SW mine run.  I start at one of the spots on the map right above the massive excavator and just work my way south finding as many cores as I can for my suit.  I was at a low of 5 the other day and after a few runs thru the area I’m up to 29 now.  Weight wise I know that is almost 1/3 of what I carry all the time but given the CAMP Is full, I don’t have much choice.
---
One funny thing I’ve noticed is how carry perks help so much.  If I dump EVERYTHING I own into my person, it adds up to about 545 weight.  But if I throw all the junk, extra AID and 2 powersuits (each with a 51 and Ultracite armor set) into the trunk, it adds up to like 800 weight between what I have and what the CAMP has.  With 30% savings on junk, weapons and food items - that is massive.
---
I wonder how much the luck attribute plays into a successful choice in this version? (Lower luck possibly greater chance of getting wrong wire)
---
That's how that attribute worked in all previous fallouts. It modified random chance towards your favor the higher your luck was.
---
From the raider vendor in Sutton. 
---
Dont be so arrogant.  This isn't school. His point was clear. Maybe hes wrong, but attacking his grammar or his ability to code is not right.  Lighten up....this place is for ppl. To talk freely.
---
Well, i think you are equating game time with real life time, when you need to understand that 5 minutes of game time is like 5 hours of real time. So it sort of lines up somewhat. 
---
That's why resistances, particularly to radiation, need to be reworked and why alot of people are calling for it, because this 'deminising returns' bullshit means that without PA/Hazmat you have to get upto some 32k rad res to have equivilent nuke zone rad protection
---
I’d be surprised if that’s a long term fix?  Likely a NAT issue.  If it comes back, one of you should play on a mobile hotspot.
---
That and in nuke zones...theres no need to one shot everything when there are 6 other players there. Just tagg it with a weaker weapon and let everyone get their hits in. 
---
Ill stand in front of these fucks every chance I get. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f647888&amp;d=sd2so2sp2l71lt2lu2a04as2ic4c72su2st1pc2pe2sb0cu2ih2es2ei0&amp;w=&amp;n=How%20about%20this?
---
These are some changes i would make, but this is definitely just opinion. Aqua boy/girl is soo situational i'd never just leave it equipped. 
---
&gt; PA MODS can be found from a lot of different vendors 
---
But honestly unless you enjoy soul destroying server hopping for the remainder of your existence, getting any and especially rare mods for any PA is best approached by simply having someone else craft it for you.  Most will do it for mats + tip. 
---
Appreciate you
---
yeah....honestly the scream should only shoot one 'blob' and have a good 30sec cooldown
---
thats fair.
---
Ya and one that doesn't cost $8. Greedy ass Bethesda.
---
Wow, thought it would be opposite.  I am on wifi and have disconnects often enough to have thought it was due to that reason alone (distance to modem is like 40 ft).  Now I must reconsider purchasing a 50 ft. cable.
---
Iv got a 3★ Grognaks axe and the all rise and alle rise has slightly higher damage but the axe swings faster so DPM is about the same.
---
My last 5 card packs have had at least 1 sometimes up to 3, duplicate single star perks. I just want to be able to combine duplicate single star cards for a random card in that respective tree (perception for 2 green thumbs or two percepti-bobble etc). Otherwise the perk card pack is useless as I am having to manually level up cards level by level. 
---
Off topic but I found out my ideal build for my character won't be complete til level 91 assuming I don't get any of the cards I need to level before then. Would really be nice if I could take the aforementioned paragraph into effect to trade those duplicates for a chance at something useful. 
---
The only limbs I see fall off now are enemies heads after a headshot. But for me the head never explodes, they just become decapitated. The dismemberment in this game seems drastically rolled back for the servers I guess.
---
I just wish you could hide (flip over) unslotted perk cards, which would gray them out (other than title/rank) and sort them all the way to the right. That way I wouldnt have to interact with those cards unless I wanted to flip them back over.
---
You gave a total stranger your explosive shot gun?
---
As I've become quite aware to lol. I digress though. Some players do just need a good killing though.
---
Nope I dont server hop and dont think I have that much stuff on me. I always consume my plans/recipes asap or drop them before I get more than 5 spare ones. My weight usually ranges between 200-300 and I rarely get overencumbered. 
---
You let some random person use your weapon? You're an idiot
---
GATTA LOVE RANDOM GENERATED LOOK CAUSE IT JUST WORKS.
---
My last perk pack (level 80) had: Green Thumb (already had), Packin' Light (have animated at level 1 and animated at level 3 already), Master Hacker (had, and it's animated), and animated Packin' Light.
---
So I have 6 points of Packin' Light (which I might add I have never intentionally selected) and as I use one single pistol as my backup ranged weapon, I consider that perk pack was essentially empty. 
---
If I get another Packin' Light it's absolutely worthless.
---
\[I'm not afraid of a challenge...\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8-xCu9hHa8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8-xCu9hHa8))
---
Oh absolutely ahaha
---
still having fun at 86, but is 10x more fun playing with friends and its not like we're even doing anything different than when i play solo
---
It used to do that with the vault suit too. That seems to have been fixed in a recent patch.
---
Truth. I put on a bloody mess for more action :)
---
I think you have to place the traps outside on the ground.  They require power but I was having trouble running power to the traps while they were inside my house.  I moved them outside on the ground and then I could run power to a lazer trip wire or a pressure plate.  Here's a screenshot of how I have it setup. 
---

---
Two shot explosive
---
Mine don't teleport to stash box, it just goes back into my inventory?
---
My reply came after reading the OP's dismissal of everyone else's thoughts. His stance was simply that he knew best and everyone else's thoughts and opinions were worthless.
---
I drop them all the time, this guy said he throws them lol :-)
---
This happened to me yesterday. Chest piece was not visible and no dot next to it in pip boy to indicate it was equipped. I did get the carry weight bonus though. 
---
Re-equipping, placing in storage, modifying in power armour station didn’t change it. The problem went away after I fast travelled.
---
That’s weird, I always get a big splatter after shooting someone’s head for the last bit of health. I don’t have bloody mess equipped. Guess it’s another bug or something 
---
The 'correct' wire is actually random each time, having higher luck increases the odds of getting it right, and successful disarm nets you a SHIT TON of mats.
---
Also: there's a random encounter where a breeding pair of deathclaws just set up a nest and some super muty jaggofs are attacking it.  I honestly wish that if you protect the nest, with the death claws it'd give you say, a 1hr buff that made all deathclaws nonhostile to you unless you damaged them
---
Oh that’s good to know 🤩
---
Just wanted to be a good guy. Like i said i didnt mind much that i lost it because I can easily buy one, but it is funny how he goes around doing the same thing doing to others.
---
&gt; that ended up not being for everyone
---
That phrase alone sums it up. This game was meant to have MASS appeal to a WIDE audience; it does not. It fell flat on it's face with that and instead hit a very small, niche group of people. Which is fine for indie games. But not for bgs.
---
The story was a let down with any real depth and oh yeah, everyone's dead except for the asshole with a TSE shotgun.
---
True, but there are challenges that are tied to individual characters that are easy to get.
---
Yes....then you go and put it in your stashbox next time you vist.
---
Pft. 2? Try 3-4 at least...
---
HTML5 for content
---
CSS3 for formatting
---
JavaScript for animations, transitions, SEO, etc.
---
And that is ignoring Python, SQL, JQuery, and others...
---
My first few I managed to kill by moving under a bridge or other overhead structure.  Their sonic blast attack doesn’t always work when you are under cover, then when they land they can’t actually get to you if you stand in the right spot.  Then I just unload my 85 round handmade into its head.  
---
Items need a unique ID so they can detect the presence of dupes.  Sadly they probably don’t even have this, but assuming they did...
---
In the first patch, I would:
---
* change the name of any duped weapons to start with *DUPED*
---
* add a new legendary property to the weapon: “WARNING: this item has been duplicated in violation of our terms of use and may be removed in a future patch.  -100% damage to players, camps, and workshops.”
---
Then in a future patch either destroy them all, or just bring explosive in line with other powers and leave it be.
---
I'm just going off of the shear number of TSE Shotguns and Rifles that are sold on r/market76 sometimes by people who have "multiples of each" - clearly they are duped when one person has 3 of the exact same 3-star shotgun. 
---
I personally use a lvl 15 explosive pump action because my lvl 40 Prime TSE Combat Shotty magically disappeared.  The only time I notice a damage difference is when I am fighting the SBQ. 
---
It's definitely labeled as executioner but it definitely does explosive damage also... So both? Lol. Other than that, not sure if it's worth it as it's the only radium rifle I have used
---
I was not aware of this the ten days ago I posted this, and if you actually read the rest of the replies, you'll see that came up. That said, I suspect they either grossly overvalued their rum, the cost of printing, or quite possibly wanted more profit after the licence agreement fees between them and Bethesda.
---
But hey, thanks for the necro. Big thumbs up. High five.
---
The Pied Piper has been my favourite encounter so far
---
sorry to hear that. sounds more and more what I need to do. Thanks!
---
Yes, I don't recall what the prefix on the laser gatling was, the pistol was a Medic's ultracite laser pistol with exploding and one other thing on it.  I could probably dig up the imgur in my post history but it's not worth it.
---
I dont like the Overseer story or the Responders faction. But yeah, I like everything else in the story.
---
Interesting because I was able to play for a couple hours last night and this morning with only a bit of stuttering once. Sounds pretty anecdotal from both of us though
---
I agree most people have been great :) Thanks
---
There is also the woman Dema convinces she is a synth. She doesn't drop synth parts if you kill her so Dema is either wrong or manipulating her showing he isn't 100% correct/honest.
---
Good one.
---
My single sentence was an appropriate length and contained only one thought.
---
You really ought to brush up on your grammar or comprehension of the English language before trying to call someone out. Your comments have barely been coherent.
---
Though, I guess *I'm* the **HYPOCRITE**. 
---
What's the rug glitch?
---
farming legendaries got boring weeks ago
---
I have a couple of instigating War Drums that do well, and a Grognak axe that lowers enemy damage that I switch to after the first drum whack assuming it doesn't kill it.
---
But then we would maybe have a multiplayer (more coop inclined) skyrim...and that was always something I wanted (eso doesn't count lol).
---
&gt; What if Vault-Tec was the Enclave
---
That's not a what if, Vault-Tec is one of the facets of The Enclave.
---
It's debatable if Vault-Tec was ever a legitimate company and it's exec's and scientists got in bed with The Enclave, or if Vault-Tec was part of the Enclave collective from the very start.
---
Because  somehow PA is just  a common item in the world and not something we  want to tie to a character like your perks and SPECIAL, we are bad game designers.
---
Helpful. Thank you, all. The names are confusing. 
---
i run an i5 6600 and an rx460, on high graphics for a 1080p build and barely ever have issues, but it seems like everyone i know with a nicer rig has problems.
---
Scripted languages with no strong types can easily fuck shit up.
---
&gt; string = "blabla"
---
&gt; if $strng="blalba" ...
---
oops missing the i so yeah it's going to create a new string.  Besides having awesome debuggers, I'm a BIG fan of compiled stuff to avoid shitty things like sudden variable invocation.  Just as people easily lose sense of variable scope.
---
Gimme some time, gotta find a cat to try and reproduce your problem.
---
You really only need around 100 of any given crafting material. Look for leather, cork, glass etc. in your stash.  These are things that are rarely used if you're wearing power armor and can be disposed of. Same with heavier ammo like mini nukes, missiles, 2mm elec cartridges and 40mm grenades. All are heavy, all are worth keeping in moderation.
---
You are...reread what I typed if you don't get it.
---
I went near a train station once with two level 8's sitting there.  As they heard me stomping up in my PA (which if I wanted to kill them I wouldn't be stomping up at a full gallop), they started running up the tracks.  I then signaled to them when they were a little ways away to "come here" emoji wise and eventually figured they were scared so I ran up to them (because I have longer stamina and they don't).  To my surprise, one guy is underwear only with a hat and the other is jumpsuit only.  I had to laugh - it was like I stumbled upon them doing something else... but they didn't run.  So I dropped them a bunch of AID/health items - pointed and went back... turned around about 30 second later and the items were gone as were they.  It was strange but I have to guess there are jackasses out there PvP'ing the lower level guys - which is shitty.  "Pick on someone your own level" is more like it if you're gonna do that - make it a fair fight.
---
Werent you selling duped items?
---
Yeah, my buddies didn't really stick around either but i have been having fun traveling to vault 76 and playing sherpa for fresh survivors starting the game... Give them weapons, walk then to key locations for unlocking fast travel, popping locks for loot, etc...  Hopefully the game balances off and friends give it another try.  It's way better than it was those first weeks
---
I have only gotton the light color wood floors and nothing has interested me since then. Have over 3k right now not even trying to do things to get more. 
---
Shame you play on PS4. I have to limit my stash to 1k and end up dropping 1k in a day of playing lol.
---
Alternatively, anything that gives you springs, screws and gears will usually give you steel too.
---
But you said "Wait 60s for frame to teleport to character stash"...and the only "stash" is a box. When it's on the player it's just your inventory.
---
I know what you mean after reading it a couple times, but the wording of that was odd lol
---
I appreciate the time taken to write this. Thank you
---
Oh shit I just shot a nuke at your base while testing this fatman
---
If it were me I'd report them to PSN. 
---
I try to do this but I change cards often and get tired of the extra screen constantly.
---
Agreed
---
Mr. House as well (though not in a simulation) so life sustaining technology is well established.
---
Wasn't the simulation idea just the justification for elevating the DEFCON level high enough to allow for post-war use of more nukes to collect exotic materials?
---
What would be the point of the existence of these exotic materials within the Chinese simulation?
---
stand on the edge of a cliff and drop it?  I dunno...
---
I agree that having unique item tag codes is a great idea. That will just take a lot longer then people think it will. I would say 3-4 months.
---
Now Bethesda could already be working on something never will know. So they could already be a month or 2 in working on that. Depending how many people they put on it they could be close to finishing that, or part of the way.
---
if you're looking to buy the signs and letters im at a vendor who is selling them on pc for 11500 caps if you want to buy them, add vickers1
---
Like i said to the other comment, i just wanted to be nice. Just find it funny how he goes around doing the same shit to other people. 
---
Trust me its just as bad on PS4 non stop crashing and anymore its PS4 crashing glitches to the point I cant even recover my system and have to literately unplug it and plug it back in just to get back to the dashboard. What sucks is I hear its not nearly as bad on PC with both crashing and studdering, seems to be a console issue alone.
---
As for the disconnects, I have been fortunate and haven't experienced many of them. Like i said I just constantly crash or completely crash my PS4.
---
I thought about getting it for PC just to have a slightly better experience, but no way in hell are they getting even more money from me.
---
They don't have legendary hunting rilfes in the game, man. Try again. 
---
what platform?
---
Gave away duped weapons that a duper gave me. Sold weapons I had bought. Long story can edit this later and added the story for you from a link where I wrote it all out.
---
It is a random wire each time. The rewards are just modest scrap loot.
---
Some one else said its effective against scorched.
---
I just had my wife sit on my keyboard to try and replicate, nothing but stcky keys though....
---
Just need to hit them once then if they ever die you get the xp its best with Grenades try to horde them I like molatoves the best because it has an affect for a while and I can hit more enemies 
---
This is the exact reason I stopped playing for now, the constant disconnects and no chance to get back into the same server.
---
It gets worse every day too.. Like that 150 with the TSE in whitesprings by the golf club?  He was 50 yesterday when he bought his TSE for 500 caps.  Oh and now there's 10 of him.
---
This is the wasteland. That being said what he did wasn't cool, I recommend hiring a bounty hunter on the proper sub and having them kill the guy endlessly until he gives it back or something? Want to play raider, you can play raider. 
---
On an mmo with zero GM tools to manage accounts &amp; items, zero is also the % I anticipate this happening.
---
Found this once.
---
Since then nearly all of my random encounters have just been a load of brahmin bodies and one opossum.
---
the lack of nixie tubes blinking 12:00 is kinda disappointing TBH.
---
Your barely-coherent garbage is difficult enough, on its own, to read. I attacked the grammar of a person put themselves on a pedestal. You responded by *attempting* to attack my correct grammar and sentence structure.
---
You called me a hypocrite, following your usage of even worse grammar.
---
I think you may need to take a look at the definition of "hypocrisy" before continuing. I'll assume you educated yourself and were able to find the exit. See ya. 
---
Thanks man
---
I have 13 level up points waiting, just hit level 102 the other day.
---
I don’t think it would take long to implement, and maybe a half day outage while they update all the weapons in the DB - the problem is if they haven’t already had it in place, it’s too late to use it to detect all the dupes now. It’s something you need at launch :(
---
I would love this to be a Charisma card set. The percentage could scale depending on level.
---
I am currently teaching my husband to play Fallout 76 with me. Since my game-reflexes are faster, I kill more things than he does. Sadly this means I am perpetually a few levels higher than he is. It would be great if I had a card set that let me "share" my XP gains with him. I'd sacrifice three card levels to give him up to 50% of my XP from kills. 
---
Yup, a sleeping bag and 3 webbing pouches.
---
Congratz, got mine recently too, I kind of miscalculated the mats tho, had to craft two level 25 parts, it's ok, I felt happy anyways haha
---
Pacifist mode. Never leave camp without it.
---
I have perks I want to take through level 151, though I'm only level 93. But after that, maybe. :) I want to add points to luck and pick up class freak, but only because all my friends can super jump and are fast. :) So maybe I'll respec. Not sure tho.
---
Sorry I don't recall every weapon that I've dropped correctly
---
I chose correctly once. You get some decent technical scrap.
---
Guy was just sitting there. Hos turrets were shooting at my stuff inside.
---
I had a two shot gauss and yea, it did feel like it was missing in VATs a lot more than it should have.

Seemingly the best solution to the fermi paradox.

Naive much 
---
Damn I wish I knew this before
---
This needs to happen. While playing with my buddy I collect every bottle of alcohol and beer, my buddy even drops them for me as well. I would love to make my own booze. I also wish that after a few drinks, your strength goes up more and more. 
---
Actually iirc in the trailer the guys arm is at his side, and his other arm across his chest like he's trying to hold his vitals in
---
From what I understand they didn’t have a system like that in place or tools. That’s the rumor. That’s why it would take longer.
---
Oh well that's pretty good then! 
---
Yeah executioners is a primary effect which will always show up first and take over the name of the weapon. The Explosive effect is always a secondary effect so its both then. 
---
sounds like a great weapon. 
---
I’ve been saving perk points in case I need abilities I’ve not needed before at a moments notice because of something I’m doing with a group. 
---
Sad that server hopping really is the best answer for almost every activity in the game.
---
I really wish i could do more with them i just end up killing them. 
---
At worst, they might see that you go offline. It doesn't directly tell them that they've been removed.
---
Pharma Farma 3, events, and the Safe for Work quest.  Pharma Farma is both simple and the main way, just use the search option on every med/chem box or Doctors Bag(think that's what they are called).  Events are also pretty simple, but not that reliable.  As for Safe for Work, sometimes that first cashe has an absurdly high number of Stimpacks in it(max I've gotten from it is 57 Stimpacks).  Similarly, the second cashe can have an absurdly high number of Bobby Pins(max I've seen was 138) and the 3rd cashe sometimes has 15+ of ever chem(except Overdrive for some reason) in it.  Finishing the quest can also sometimes reward you with more supplies than normal(which they fixed for a lot of quests before, but apparently it still happens for this one).
---
It is higher than that, what level Garb do you have?
---
The Voice of Set, Garb of Mysteries and Blade of Bastet can be "re-made" into higher levels. There are level 25,35 and 45 versions of each ... you must have the original version to craft the higher level version.
---
You place any rug down, then put a furnishing on top of it. When you move the rug whatever was placed on top of it will follow, only the furnishing will no longer have a collision box. That means you can place furnishings in spaces they normally wouldn't fit as long as there is room for the rug to be placed. 
---
The tape doesn't mean she actually died, she was just very wounded. I'm also not sure if it's the real "last" tape, as it makes out its the first time she's seen a mole miner, despite having traversed the mole miner infested Ash heap. 
---
Good info, thank you
---
Redeeming treasure maps, yeah
---
Maybe it was a trap - who knows but honestly the only way you're gonna get the "Wanted removed" is to get killed.
---
A few levels back I was at a camp of 2 100+ level guys.  I was looking around and found it strange that the Silver Extractor was locked, so me being me (and not realizing it was "locked by a player") easily unlocked it and blamo - 10 cap wanted.  The two guys were nearby that were part of a team and I realized what I did (and we were in a blast zone of a nuke no less).  So given my MIC wasn't on - I did what was right, got out of my PA, kneeled down and they knew what I wanted.  TSE - booom... i went flying and died in one shot.  Respanwed right outside the area we were in and outside the nuke zone, this time got my MIC working.  They were both laughing . because the knew I knew I fucked up and wanted them to kill me because I hate having a bounty on me.  Played with them and got a level or two up in the meantime and learned some things - only to have the server crash and their names forever be lost as the previous folks you encounter disappear from that last session if the game crashes I noticed.  Here's to getting a patch soon to make the game far more stable.
---
Two shot 50 cal absolute best. Followed by a primed two shot mini. All other ranged against the queen is garbage, not to say you can't be useful and kill the trash mobs around her making it easier and less worrisome for the dps and you can still pot shot her to make sure you get loot but your effectiveness to fight her with those guns is trash duty.   
---
As for PvP AA/expo pump or if you can get a AA/expo double
---
That’s a random encounter that spawns at one of the many random encounter spawns. I found the same thing 2 times both had different holo messages. 
---
I always assumed that meant the game was a simulation for us, the player. 
---
I was in my CAMP building and such last night. 3 crashes in an hour and half.
---
PSA: don't give anyone you don't know or trust stuff you don't want to lose.
---
Have fun in the water
---
my experience is with coding webpages, more specifically character sheets for use in roll20
---
Believe it or not a lot of those items I bought with caps. I have hit cap limit 50 times already. Up till Christmas I was playing the game 8-12 hours a day Farming and grinding caps. Farming Whitesprings nuked and selling Legendaries I got for Caps. I also deleted my sales post after I sold something.
---
That’s how I hit 175 so fast. I haven’t played much since Christmas. Been playing BFV and spending time with my GF.
---
Maybe you need a different gun???
---
Aw, did I make you mad enough to call me names now? Oh, the definition would be you and your toxic behavior. You know, if the shoe fits.
---
Just imagine being that poor of youtuber you have to take sponsorships from caps for real money websites. 
---
Is anyone even surprised that Bethesda didn't even quality test the game by slamming cats on keyboards? 
---
Such a mess...
---
Now they leave it to the player base to expose cat-related bugs post-release.
---
For now, I am banning my cat from jumping on the keyboard. At least cats always follow directions. 
---
It's for the multipurpose/fire axe
---
I think it was fixed by a community patch which fallout 76 needs to enable mod support and private servers so the community can fix this buggy pos.
---
Add the flair query, "FLAIR:+//+BETHESDA+REPLIED". Alternatively, you can creep /u/BethesdaReplied. 
---
My apologies I did not realize he was selling it I thought he wanted to give it away. I understand you cannot but the op did not understand this when he posted.
---
I thought you meant worthless as in not worth picking up or going out to find. That it is just easier to go online and find the codes that other people posted.
---
I misunderstood you. 
---
Don't log out at Whitesprings unless in full PA or hazmat suit (even then I suggest not to).
---
Anyone can use your stash box, but the inventory you access from it is your own. So another person accessing the same box in your own C.A.M.P is actually accessing their stash inventory. All stash boxes are linked except the overseer stash boxes. 
---
Right on the d-pad in controllers uses stimpacks. Left is to swap weapons. Learn this quickly or learn it the hard way. 
---
PA frames you get into belong to you. Only you can use it. Once you get out of it there is a 60 second timer. After the runner ends the PA will go into your inventory automatically. From your inventory you can deploy or drop the PA. Dropping means anyone can get into it now or take the pieces off of it. Deploying means only you can get into it. 
---
Also in regards to PA, if a dropped PA frame with pieces or not is near a stand and you choose to use the stand or repair/modify, the nearby frame will become yours. 
---
Frames weigh 10lbs. Even if they have all of the pieces on there the frame still only weighs 10lbs. You can use this to store thousands of pounds of PA pieces. 
---
Buying something you know to be illegally gained still makes you guilty. Kinda like buying stolen property that you know is stolen.
---
You are a part of the problem and hopefully this is the penalty for being a dipass. I coukd help you but i don't wanna.
---
r/outofcontext
---
It’s a free world. If someone is killing shit then either join them with even power or move servers. This is how it’s always worked in mmos.
---
yup, and people thing game devs and such should just make games out of the goodness of their hearts despite them being a translator on crack, more or less.  Seriously, it'd like if you had 5 countries with different languages and only one dude to translate what's being said to all the other languages
---
Please, send more!
---
lmao
---
Hate to tell you this but if you gave him the weapon hes no scammer, maybe a liar (sucks) but he hasn't scammed you, hes abused your trust yeah but its no "scam" lol
---
Hopefully you learnt your lesson....if not can i borrow your caps for a minute or two please :P
---
It's atleast twice an hour for me as well. Definitely getting worse. I hate that stupid gasp of air sound!! 
---
I found 2 players (lvl 8 and 9) last night and gave them a 2 shot laser pistol and a 2 shot broadsider. Figured once they get to 45 it should really help out.
---
Never understood those here trying to sell items for caps/cash. You can't take it with you and there's no better feeling than making someone else happy for no other reason than to know you're the one that made their night/week.
---
I have seen 3 ways one does use a stash box and logging in and off I watched 2 guys do it I chucked in some mini nukes they freaked out (no clue why slap mini nukes are funny) ran up snagged the bag on the ground and logged out then logged back into a different server and found like 50k wood and steel and some random terrible guns and dumped them into a pond where they would never been seen again 
---
No mods for the Grog's axe curerently :(  Also can't repair it to double durability.
---
1) is fortnite a survival game? is it a large map with resources? 
---
2) griefing does not need to happen if 1- you cant see other peoples locations on the map, and 2- there is reputation. In this system, the most likely to be greifed (on PC anyway) would be predators and murders, or maybe theives. I can almost garuntee that. 
---
3) The point about playing with freinds is EXACTLY my point. You guys get on the same server and stay on it. 100 caps is nothing. But its enough to keep you from jumping servers 100 times to get plans. Or kill someone, jump servers, kill someone else, jump servers (which is exactly what is happening now) 
---
4) the current PvP system is more greify than what I layed out. 
---
I had a random want all my .45 ammo. I offered it up for 1 cap each, he didn't bite. Should've offered it at 3 each since it was my primary ammo. I can't imagine what he thought, free ammo?
---
Seems more plausible as to why the vaults are so fucked up.  It's that Stanford Prison experiment all over again.
---
Man, don't trust anyone! You goofed. He was a raider in disguise. This is all on you my friend. 
---
What console or PC?
---
I think they are fine with duping, they have not tried very hard to fix it. Also any and all FO4 dupes work in FO76 they didn't fix it then and I doubt they have the ability to fix it now. It is like you guys think it is just one and that is cute. 
---
They’re the ones making a big deal about it, then proceed to dupe because they don’t want to grind in this shit game. The abomination that is the content creators for this game definitely needs to be called out. 
---
I'm sitting on 67 of those....and at least 4 pack openings.  
---
Its easy mode man. I'm one of the few who actually looted a TSE shotgun. 
---
Its easy mode.
---
&gt; Tinker bench?
---
Yeah, but the cost of fluxes unless you're drowning in them isn't worth it by far.
---
Chameleon + 15 Agility + Escape Artist = Never Spotted
---
It's not flexing. You can get 1.4k caps per day if you go to all the vendors.
---
Or maybe they are adults who have things called jobs and responsibilities and thusly, have a hard time coordinating between multiple people to all get together to play a game... If I get a game, I want it to work when I want to play it, not be dependent on others just to play it. 
---
I know of this perk I was really wondering could someone make a medic build with a flare gun or smg with flaming and heal allies at range with it 
---
A protectron that, because of the nuke and emp from it, gained sentience. This would be so bad ass!
---
What piece?
---
This seems so backwards, but I’ll try it later as I’ve been disconnecting constantly on a wired connection 
---
"The Tourist" - My survivor was like 10 when they entered the vault. So I'm revisiting all the vacation day and school field trip locations and taking pictures.
---
Succulents and fish lamp! 
---
Why? They are low level employees  who say nothing but "thanks" and "okay."  They are not to blame for a  broken game.
---
Well some people are really stupid so you can't help their assumptions.  I bought mine with my hard-earned caps, too, but that doesn't change the fact that it is likely a duped item.
---
Oh that’s a great use for that helmet. 
---
hi,
---
so. no screenshot, sry (timed stuff is hard to test), but took a trusty stopwatch and did some testing
---
Testchar my lvl122 char. Imporant stats Endurance 2, Agility 14. 200AP points.
---
only well fed and well hydrated. None of food END/AGI bonuses
---
Mutations: Bird Bones (+4 AGI), Speed Demon +20 Move Speed, i also have Marsupial, but it doesn't apply to movement
---
For Power Armor (X-01): i had a Jetpack chest with AP-1 (whatever it means, AP is still 200, probably passive ap regen)
---
so i test few things:
---
a) Lone Wanderer level3
---
b) Action Girl level3
---
c) Marathoner level3
---
d) Gun Runner level2 (pistol equipped), otherwise shotgun equipped
---
e) Optimised Servos Power Armor Leg (1 piece) equipped
---
f) No power armor with similar scenarios
---
Test Method. Long straight near Overseer Camp near Flatwoods. Start point just south of it, back against the truck with the cones.
---
Stopwatch starts, interval 1 (Sprint or S): how long can i sprint until AP is 0 (down to run speed) and interval 2 (Regen or R): how long AP refresh back to 100%
---
Because stopwatch is manually triggered, some 0,1-0,2 sec fluctuations are okay
---
Noted runs are non-bugged. Sprint bugs out at very fast speed (Speed Demon possibly) and sometimes AP gets favorably stuck. Optimised Servos run really bugged out often (mostly bugged, so had to re-run like 20 times), Marathoner without PA also bugged often (but not so much), other runs rarely bugged out.
---
Test 1 - no bonuses
---
Power Armor, no bonuses
---
Run1
---
S: 18,51 sec
---
R: 15,65 sec
---
Run2
---
S: 18,55 sec
---
R: 15,47 sec
---
Test 2 - Lone Wanderer
---
PA, Lone Wanderer level3
---
S: 18,30 sec
---
R: 12,81 sec
---
Run2:
---
S: 18,48 sec
---
R: 12,79 sec
---
Lone Wanderer works OK
---
Test 3 - Action Girl
---
PA, LW3, Action Girl level 3
---
S: 18,41 sec
---
R: 10,79 sec
---
S: 18,47 sec
---
R: 10,53 sec
---
Action Girl works OK
---
Test 4 - Marathoner
---
PA, LW3, AG3, Marathoner level 3
---
S: 18,51
---
R: 10,36
---
S: 18,43
---
R: 10,31
---
Marathoner DOES NOT WORK OK with Power Armor
---
Test 5 - Gun Runner
---
PA, LW3, AG3, M3, Gun Runner level 2, laser pistol equipped
---
R: 10,43
---
didn't do second test, DOES NOT WORK for sprint
---
Test 6: Optimised Servos
---
PA, LW3, AG3, M3, Optimised Servos 1 leg piece
---
Run1 
---
S: 23,01
---
R: 10,53
---
S: 22,84
---
R: 10,62
---
Optimised Servos work OK and CONSIDERABLY increase sprinting time
---
4/5 times bugged out and allowed even farther. Sometimes for easy 10+ second more and ran out of road (times not registered
---
Test 6:
---
No Power Armor, LW3, AG3, M3
---
S: 30,42
---
R: 10,28
---
S: 30,38
---
R: 10,25
---
Without Power Armor, Marathoner level 3 works OK and CONSIDERABLY increases sprinting time. 
---
About 1/2 times bugged out and allowed to run even farther and ran out of road
---
Test 7:
---
No PA, LW3, AG3
---
S: 19,01
---
R: 10,18
---
S: 18,84
---
R: 10,20
---
without M3, sprint is way shorter, same as PA
---
Test 8:
---
No PA, LW3, no Action Girl
---
S: 18,55
---
R: 12,63
---
S: 18,44
---
R: 12,79
---
without AG3, AP refill is a bit slower
---
So, all in all, what i learned
---
a) Marathoner works REALLY well for non-power armor and DOES NOT WORK AT ALL for Power Armor
---
b) Action Girl 3 works with both scenarios, but with Lone Wanderer 3, difference is quite small
---
c) Optimised Servos considerably increase sprinting time for PA and often bugs out and AP will be locked for few moments and allows even farther sprint
---
d) Sprint SPEED is identical with or without Power Armor
---
e) Gun Runner and pistol does not affect sprinting
---
If you use PA: consider one Optimised Servos. Just so much difference. Don't use Marathoner. Can use Action Girl, but not that profitable
---
If you don't use PA: definetly use Marathoner. Nearly doubles sprinting and also favorably bugs sometimes, allowing even more sprint. Can use AG, but not that profitable.
---
Creepy. Thanks.
---
She didn't actually die from the Mole Miners' attack. That's not the final holotape for the quest
---
I've heard of it being done before 
---
I'm not trying to be funny, you guys need to try thinking in the realm of the reality in which this game exists. If you think that much thought was put into the story of this game I dunno what to say to you other than... Good luck. You and all your "crew". Can't have any fucking nuance in a conversation gotta just jump on the fucking bandwagon.
---
forgot I actually have the tesla blueprint need to make a few of those 
---
If that’s the case, it’s unlikely any amount of time would allow them to identify all existing dupes with certainty.  They’d have to put it in place and then start a new “season” of characters to insulate them from past duping.  Unlikely they would do all this.
---
It's part of the game dude. He didn't use any glitches to steal it from him. OP GAVE it to him. It sucks, yes I agree, but this is the wasteland, trust no one. 
---

See, this is why I use a ONE shot explosive legendary. :D
---
Seriously though, folks gotta not be asses. 
---
Part of why I even still carry the 10mm pistol is so I can refrain from 1 shotting stuff when low level folks are around. Gotta share the load!
---
I dont know if its a 100% sure thing but it definitely worked for me lol. 
---
Man... that's super rad but I wish battles felt this immersive. With my experiences, its usually just a melee slap fight or a level 100+ one shotting me. 
---
The constant stimpacking ruins it as well. Usually it's whoever is willing to burn all their supplies is the one to "win". PvP lacks so much immersion.
---
Oh, well put spoiler tags for those who havn't finished &gt;!!&lt;
---
I destroy my wife's camp till about 2000 bounty then wait for people to come for me. That's fun. I lose some win most. Always come out with more caps.
---
Eh I don't think you're entitled to anyone's base. I usually leave a unlocked back door accessible to jets and a keypad door myself however 
---
Sounds like a job for mini-nukes and a little cover.

If we are in a simulation, then its the beta and when we get out, we'll get npc's and storage upgraded

It's actually easier solo as the robot respawns are smaller.

Everyone watching: "Wait, you were holding a gun?"

Screenshot? What does it look like?

Now you will think twice before trying to be a "good guy".

Wut.
---
I didn't call anyone any names. Are you OK? Are you having a stroke? Or are you perhaps 12 years old?
---
That is not the definition of hypocrisy. An example would be calling someone a name, like "hypocrite" (like you did initially), and then telling the other person that they're calling names (when they aren't).
---
Do your parents know you're being bratty on reddit? Isn't it a school day? Jesus. 
---
1) No but it is a BR game like you want
---
2) These are pointless because it'll happen anyway

3) If you want to server hop and that's how you enjoying playing the game (not me) go ahead. You're no one to tell someone how to enjoy the game.

4) Lol no

Bro what?? How am I supposed to know they are duped? I only bought from people that were decent lvls. No low level alt accounts that people use to dupe. And I didn’t buy and if I saw that they had way too many maps to be acquired through normal playing, then I would not buy. I only bought from people that seemed legit. 
---
It’s really not that hard. Legendary Assultron was my biggest obstacle, even still - really wasn’t that much of a challenge. The process of just time consuming if anything 
---
two shot better than anti-armor or bloodied 50 cal?
---
I always leave my resource extractor unlocked, because I don't need the lead *that* badly, and it's easy to get more.

Spoiler tags my dude for those not there yet. 
---
This. I’m probably carrying 20 and I spent a good few hours a while ago using up all the ones I’d collected previously. I feel like people are just don’t loot well. Maps, power cores, stims... I keep reading people complain about these things and I’m always running a surplus...
---
I don’t they will do nuclear option of wiping out everybody’s inventory either. I don’t think they could afford having players leave the game. Or the bad publicity that it would receive. I really feel Bethesda is in a very tough spot honestly.
---
yeah I know right Bethesda just like made the whole Elder Scrolls world that has captivated the hearts and minds of millions of gamers for years on end. They clearly don't know what they are doing making video games, the fucking amateur assholes.
---
Why Charleston? No good flux, never seem's to be any legendaries. What's the attraction?
---
Im level 238 with 400 hours in and all my gear was farmed. Buying from dupers further exacerbates the problem. Not only that they were then resold to others for a profit.
---
Destroying annoying bases is great.  I don't even see a reason for that kinda base.  Throw on power armor and ghoul and just bash zombie heads in with no danger.
---
If my mic is off, I'm certainly not going to turn it on because some random tells me to. What possible scenario are you thinking, where someone knows how to turn off and on their mic, and has their mic off. But you walk up and tell them to turn it on, so they turn it on?
---
I've taken out more bases behind the clubhouse then I can count.   I'll then get myself down to the overseer's camp and get some low level toon to kill me.  So yes...keep it up.  
---
White Springs during a nuke zone.
---
White Springs back area by the golf course.
---
Watoga during a nuke zone
---
yeah...
---
Why?  Because I have interest in it. 
---
In no way do I want to blame them for anything.  Just wanted to search and see what was responded to.
---
Everything is around the level 50 area. Take about 30 stim packs and 5 or do radaway and 1 rad x. 5 or more fusion cores and a ranged weapon if you are melee (for turrets).  If tu oi have hacking 3 and lockpick 3 it makes the thing easier but can be done without them.
---
If there is an objective kill everything or most things that pose a danger to your health and do the objective as quickly as possible because as far as I'm aware the waves of robots sd are infinite when you have an objective in as room.
---
Oh, certainly not entitled. But taking the sum total of the situation, it put me over the edge. 
---
You do need 30 AP to trigger it but it's glitchy because of lag so... sometimes it triggers more than it should.  It's a great perk especially with other % based damage reducers like Blocker, Lone Wanderer, and Nerd Rage.
---
I'm level 35 and my stash is about half full I only keep very good weapons I can't use yet. ALOT of scrapped junk and ammo and t60 power armor I can't put on a frame yet(only for fissure site prime since I'm a unarmed character.
---
If crafting them, make sure you have Chemist.  And you can grab Super Duper at 50+ for even more.  Although I've never had a problem with stims to warrant crafting them.
---
Thats a fun thought, but the duping covers a wider margin than just a weapon type, what about the guy who literally has "over a million pounds of junk in his stash".
---
 Fixing said weapons/armor, making serums, ammo, its all a gross advantage that we will never have, and thats fine for now, but think long term when lvlXXX weapons come out, they use mats to make/fix and very likely a vast amount, the dupers will hold that advantage high above anyone els.  I've invested 500+hrs, and the game is broken, we all know it, its taboo to talk about it but we enjoy the game, for it to be fixed, with realistic time constraints a wipe is easiest for the long run.
---
When all the players in the nuke zone refrain from shooting anything until I arrive and we all sweep the zone together taking turns tagging enemies then I'll do this.
---
Until that happens though I'm going to kill what I see and take what I can. This is a post-apocalyptic Appalachia, not disneyland.

Does he gave a youtube I can subscribe to? This is the first I've heard of a player truly roleplaying.

I cut a wire. It didn’t blow up. I can’t remember which one. High luck might help though.

No idea, can't get in it. So far, I've noticed Excavator is nearly unbreakable, and Raider armor costs absolutely nothing to repair, so I've kind of written off other sets, after spending three days gathering springs to fix a few T45 pieces.
---
They are fine.  Lvl 8 Mr. Handy, lvl 40 robobrains, lvl 50ish assaultrons, etc...
---
They come in set waves, about 4-6 every minute or so.  If you can kill them in a few hits you're good.
---
No, you're not the boss of me now.
---
I have seen them and would like to know as well.  Probably linked to a quest line but an inquiring mind wants to know :)

Related but unrelated.

I have a grognak axe with increased swing speed.. And whenever i use it on mobs i cant help but hear the Butcher Pete song in my head.

I think a few folks did it to TotalBiscuit as well (possibly the very folks you mentioned), he got a lot of DMCA takedowns on his reviews about games that were absolute trash.

Even just basic coding you need at least 3 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Granted only 1 of them is really “coding”. HTML is markup language and CSS performs no logic. Only JavaScript is a real “coding language”

You can use a campfire on a floor and the game thinks its ground so you can then place purifiers or crops on the campfires indoors. 
---
Haha you too are to shy to let them know that you just wanted to play a bit with them but not the whole time? 
---
Why wouldn't I still be playing it? The game is massive and I haven't even explored 1/4th if the map and I've been playing since BETA 
---
Or just dont loot it cause you dont really need it, its plentiful enough that if all the players that didnt need it, would stop looting it, then when they actually needed it and went looking for it they would find it with out having to spend hours hoping between servers. 
---
You literally dont need anything you cant use
---
Same way anything illegal (whether due to terms of service or actual laws) exists: Nobody has shut em down yet.
---
Yeah my first great drop was a 3 Star TSE Pump and that was around level 80.. I believe.
---
It was a little murky.  I think they called it a critical in some places but the bonuses weren't applied.  
---
Also escape artist doesnt work in PA I kinda figured it wouldn't but now that means my stealth character basically has to use hazmat suit.
---
Baggies you drop seem to last only until the cell unloads or resets. 
---
In this engine, the single player game is divided into cells, and only actually loads the occupied cell and adjacent ones. There are a few artifacts of this, like if you have a really long range weapon you can't damage enemies across a cell border if you are not within like 100 meters of it. I think the server is also only loading occupied cells and adjacent ones, plus possibly empty cells with ongoing events? It would be reasonable. Also in the FO4 etc cells 'reset' at semi random intervals when the player is away (it determines when the cell will reset and deals with it when you get back there) which used to cause problems with items being culled from containers in settlements and such.
---
I've dropped a baggie of stuff no-one would pick up , left, came back quite a while later and still had it there in areas that have a lot of ongoing activity, like nuke zones or just Whitesprings, Watoga, etc. I've also dropped a bag in a quieter area (spoiled fruit, or like the time I'd played 7 straight hours and dropped something like 5000 steel) like a   
---
 remote train station, left, come back for some reason within a few minutes and had no bag present.
---
Loot in containers seems to stay much longer, though I'm not sure how long. 
---
The way that works would make sense; an actual container is something the server can more easily keep track of than the temporary bag. Another thing that highlights this; I was clearing an internal area and moved through a kinda central room area you pass through several times when doing the quests and exploring. The fourth or fifth time I moved through there suddenly there's a bag. Full of junk, much unscrapped. A few min later someone showed up to reclaim their corpses' junk. They were surprised because they said they'd died more than an hour ago and had just not bothered to come back at the time. I think it kept the bag tracked as part of their 'reclaim your junk' quest but didn't spawn it till they got close because the cell had been unloaded before I arrived. There was no sign anyone had been in there before me until that bag popped up. No corpses, meat piles, and everything was locked tight. In fact iirc to get where I/the bag was I'd had to hack/unlock things.
---
I very rarely disconnect (perhaps once every eight hours) but in about half the cases it's my internet connection (the router sits next to my desk so I can see when it's misbehaving); the other times I'm invited to submit an error report, so I'm guessing these are legitimate server issues. (I'm on PS4.)
---
I dont like the missions that u gotta put a holotape in a computer. I have 2 bugged quest cause of that
---
There IS a right wire, but it's a random number chance each encounter. I have found three of these and one time I guessed correctly...the loot is meh at best, bout the same from a crashed satellite, but it was cool to get it right. :)
---
Your doing Todd’s work 
---
No, they’re just too needy for my liking. 
---
Nah being untrustworthy doesn't make you a scammer, maybe a c**t but not a scammer :/
---
Guess they've ruined it for the next person that has a genuine reason to "borrow" your weapons though :(
---
I think you've given me an idea on what to use my 1st orbital strike on
---
I like the Holotapes, I just wish they were alittle shorter. Some of them drag out forever!!!
---
My character is a loner who spent most of his 25 years trying to avoid people. He goes to great lengths to avoid others like the plague, but will work together if necessary. He wasn't old enough to develop skills before the war, so much of his talents stem from what he learned form Vault-Tec reading material.
---
Like the OP's post if you think he's salty.
---
I still haven't found one. I think I'm just gunna buy one for caps or trade. I'd love to have a TSE gatling gun.
---
LOL! I wasn't even thinking about that and just mindlessly using the phrase. No, I meant my Fallout 4 Trotsky didn't look at all like him despite my best efforts. He's kind of a weird looking guy and was difficult to model with my complete lack of artistic talent. 
---
That would make sense, Ill have to see how close nuke silos are to them
---
I don't really find that very compelling to be honest. As far as I'm concerned, the stuff could have happened years ago, seeing as I can't do anything about it at all as a player. You can spend 100+ hours building a gorgeous base, and then carry on with the story, and it will play out the same, they'll still all be dead. The game pretends like you were just days/hours away from saving the day even though it makes no difference if you rush the story or take your time. Seeing as I've got no control over whether the people die or not, why not make it something that happened years ago? Rather than the overseer, why not follow a survivor's story as they try to find the cause of the scorched and stop it before it's too late? The player could then be the one to follow this trail and finish what the poor survivor couldn't.
---
It's the same problem that other Bethesda games face. Characters in Skyrim will happily wait for you by the dungeon they told you about for weeks or even months, and it's one of the things that really takes me out of the game.
---
I'm lvl 102 does that make me your boss? 
---
I'll add you when I'm next on and keep an eye out for you
---
Fair enough, no need to  feel  defensive.
---
If you accidentally melee another player during a fight like you describe, does Pacifist Mode still work? 
---
I think they mean, how can other players who see you killing all these ghouls know that **you** are using a two-shot explosive weapon? How do they know you're not just using an explosive gun that doesn't have two-shot?
---
I get we all like the game here but I think that's giving it waaaay too much credit. haha
---
You only had one at the end of the cave?
---
I had two and one could fly through walls...
---
This doesn't stop all the other one shot builds, I could still easily snipe legendaries with one punch man.

Indeed, Excavator is tough. After a few dozen nuke zones I've had to repair a part or two.
---
I'm so glad PA isn't like FO4 duribility wise. That stuff was tinfoil.
---
I'll report for spam instead thanks
---
Im lvl 80 never bought a single thing from other players. I might have 3 or 4 maps of one spot...that is 100 hours of gameplay. If you posses more than that then you did not earn them legit. 
---
No one is going to help you even though there is a fix...a simple one at that.
---
Stop helping break the game and try to play well with others. Oh and being a million pounds overweight is part of why the servers are trash and normies like me can't stay online for longer than an hour at a time.
---
The good news is you learned a valueable lesson while only help to ruin an online game. Try not to be like this out in the real world...it will not end well for you.

Hey, Bethesda has added a lot of new xontent in the last months. You can now spend up to $1000 on nearly 200 pieces of new ingame content in the atomic shop.

Anyways can I get some one to help with this thread I won’t be able to edit it and put make it comprehensive until tonight =/
---
I guess I shouldn't complain that a dev responded.. but out of all posts it's this one haha. 
---
There are some meh ones, But there are many where you get the full feeling of emotion and sense of their character. I like the long form monologues better than a short sentence in a daliogue tree. 
---
There are many of the holotapes I like listening to while puttering around my CAMP.
---
I wish there were more of the radio plays. Or even if we could load some into a Radiation King and watch some holo-movies or play Nuka Tapper on my couch on the RK.
---
Even better would be able to find Mistress of Mysteries holotapes or Silver Shroud holotapes to put on at CAMP or while walking the backroads.
---
So 'that's' what it means. I was going to ask.
---
Looks like I'm getting more AP regen for this build then
---
Lets at full loot while were at it, add a toggle so that its only enabled when you are wanted, if you die you risk loosing that they an carry. 
---
Oh yeah and no more of this letting my team mates kill me to clean the bounty shit....
---
Do you mean you can't reach lvl 102?
---
Yeah--when this happens to me and the other player doesn't continue to shoot at me, I assume it was a negligent discharge and not deliberate. 
---
You underestimate sexual desperation.

I'm playing an alt and am no longer focused on grinding hard.

Please do. The more elaborate and purposeful the destruction, the more likely the point gets across.

There is also a large discrepancy between the game that was sold to us at E3 and the game that was delivered.

Ammosmith and Super Duper combo.  180 rounds for same mats and sometimes 360 (when SD triggers).

I’ll change it to, “report this post if you still play fo76”, now that would be epic.
---
They do. Two-shoot is a first star effect. Explosive is a second star effect. You could have a Mutant-Slayer’s fun with Explosive as the second star. It’s just not common. TSE is common because it’s clearly too strong and thus the most duped sort of item.

"pvp mode" they never specifically said servers or event or anything other than "new pvp mode"

You mean downvote.

Right? it's certainly buggy and i get that it's a game that is not for everyone. It's fine to not enjoy or dislike the game, but i don't get the visceral hate some people have for it. They act like Todd Howard is their father that went out for a pack of cigarettes 10 years ago and never came back.

Probably not the BEST way... But when i need a quick stash of steel ill go somewhere with super mutants or scorch, and take all their weapons. Break em down. Get the steel.

Never forget, Big Brother Reddit is always judging you for some contrived etiquette you have broken.

I still remember how the dark souls subreddit, during Dark Souls 2 specifically I believe, got to the point where if you pvp'd with someone(which is typically a non-consensual act because you could invade other peoples worlds at random) and **didn't** get their attention and bow before attacking them, then you were a scumbag loser griefer.

I was soloing a solo but then a lvl 80 something came in and started clearing things out, luckily he had the nuke code unscrambled

Best quest in the game, but by the time I could wear the reward  item, it's worse than my other  stuff.

Fine balancing. Meanwhile, ultracite farmers can dupe TSEs all day long.  WTF.

Bethesda needs to change the sort order when loading tapes into terminals to either be alphabetical, or sorted by newest first.

I'm level 193, that makes me boss of both of you then?
---
There are a couple secret underground places in the game that let you exit through a shortcut that leads out of a port-a-potty.
---
I've enjoyed the ones necessary for quests. For example, the overseer's journey and the Mistress of Mysteries holotapes are all worth listening to, IMO. The random holos that you find in weird onesies and twosies across the map, less so.
---
I was fighting in one where someone dropped their camp and built a ton of turrets and it made me lag bad. Accidentally shot a couple guys because they were melee killing the other scorched and they took all my stuff I picked up there to fix my weapons. It was a huge pain respawning, fighting glowing yaogaui and hordes of ghouls to get back to the main fight.

Pure melee build here at its always 50 / 50 if the damn things land or if i give up and run away after wasting ten mins wondering if there going to land :/
---
Just one of the things that Bethesda should have fixed already but can't / or can't be bothered to.
---
I had the repeat error crash 3 or 4 times last night while in combat where I'd hear the same gunshot continuously while frozen, required me to manually quit out of the game each time. Similar thing happened two times but without a continuous sound at a free states vendor as well. Hadn't connect the dots on it being that vendor, but it was both times.
---
theres one by the charleston station, just to the east, where are some others?
---
finding a downed vertibot and cargobot is always great

---
My bad, I assumed landing *at some point* was one of the mechanics of fighting a Scorch Beast. If they're **meant** to just float around and spam-screech, then I'll just skip them in the future.
---
Its annoying I've been looking for a 2 shot handmade but everyone wants to sell me a explosive one I don't want cheat weapons just a good one
---
Yeah no you’re totally right they are supposed to land. But if they don’t, they usually still die in about 12 shots from a gauss rifle
---
I dropped a level 1 10mm pistol (fully modded) on a new player at the overseers camp a while back.

If I'm remembering correctly, Rift had a system where people partipating in a rift were automatically grouped in a raid party.  It was dynamic, with the option to opt out, it required no action from the player.  When the rift ended, people were put back into their previous groups.  This prevented kill stealing and everyone was able to get exp and loot.  At the end of the rift, the people that did the most damage or healing got a bonus... it's been awhile since I played the game, so I don't remember exactly what you got :P
---
If Fallout 76 implemented something like this for nukes and events, along with shared exp, it could make everything more enjoyable.  The biggest problem I see are people that AFK in the area, in Rift the area was too small for mobs to ignore you.
---
This and the responses remind me of the indoctrination theory of Mass Effect 3.  There are things throughout the game that point to it and it would add an interesting element to the game. However, it's unlikely to be true.

Undercut?

level 217 here, i save a 10 spare point just in case a new perk will show up (i think they said it will be coming in the next update) that i will want to take,also,from my experience in other online games they will probably going to nerf/buff certain builds in the near future for more balance so i may not always count on my melee build+tse shotgun .
---
I traded with multiple people that were lvl 200+ and even one or two 300+ people that had never touched their treasure maps and were happy to sell them to me for cheap.  They all had 80+ maps.  I myself am or was lvl140.  I was hunting and buying treasure maps for over a week so I definitely bought from about 30 people or more.  If they all had an average of 30 maps total, 30x30= 900 maps. Maps are not that hard to come by and some people sell them for really cheap.
---
I would very much appreciate you telling me this "simple fix" because I put in a lot of time and really dont want to restart.  I am not a duper and realize that it is kinda ruining this game.  I try to stay away from it but I think buying, selling, and trading on the market is where I have some of the most fun with this game.  I know duping is out there and I try to avoid it as much as I can.

The biggest serum guy sells them for 100. 100 is too little to get worth the effort. My prices are more reasonable.

They're doing the "don't say yes or no" game, after a while one of them lose by answering "Yes" to "Do you love me?"
---
when the enemy is low health it probably shreds. hard to see how much damage its putting out with the executioners effect. 
---
Yeah energy weapons need a condition degradation overhaul. no reason a gun with such few moving parts should break so fast. if theyre gonna keep the low damage at least make them good as automatics 
---
Or, you could go into the mine and stand on the bridge that leads to where Uranium Fever happens, then back track to the Decon Shower.  Less work this way.
---
I knew nothing about dooping, but after a disconnect last night I was almost 21, I came back at just hitting 20, with most of my armor and weapons duplicated in my inventory.  to bad all my crap was crap anyway, 
---
Don't have enough flux for it unfortunately, so - need to bring your own mats :)
---
LOL! Cash registers and suitcases have become the equivalent of the Take a Penny - Give a Penny trays!
---
Haha well it'll be my first orbital strike so I guess I better find out how they work before wasting it
---
It was more important to have the servers track how quickly everyone's grilled meats are degrading.
---
I am constantly putting steel and cloth in random containers, as I am a primary melee build, and acquire steel and cloth by the 100s
---
I wonder if an anti-armor 2 shot shotgun might be the way to go then.
---
Explosive isn't really a cheat if anything it brings weapons up to the level they should be, there's no reason a scorch should take multiple sneak critical headshots 
---
You'd be surprised how many don't know they can swap cards in and out depending on circumstances.
---
I once came across one on top of a cliff, I'm assuming it's the same one you found.
---
It was near one of the treasure map spots.
---
I have teamed up with 4 people and out of those 4 there is usually just one person that crashes over and over again for no reason whatsoever. I am beginning to think it might be some items she has on her that cause the crashes. 
---
I’ve been disconnected before but I have never crashed the amount of times she has. 
---
They do land but it's a bit random, for me at least. Sometimes they land very often and other times not at all. In the latter case I walk away most of the time because the bombard is $#&amp;*ing annoying...
---
Sneaky McSneakerton?  Or perhaps Brave, Brave Sir Robin (who bravely ran away).
---
Yeah, the cost is exorbitant. It's pretty discouraging tbh. These people will destroy everything just because you're "on their node" or "on their base" when destroying everything will not get your camp to move. It's even worse when people in this thread think I staged it or "exploited" my base to get the repair bill that high when I don't even have anything fancy.
---
I find that they don’t like to land if you don’t give them enough space - sometimes if you’re on a roof or near too many trees or obstacles they don’t land. 
---
This is what I’ve seen anyways, but they can be very rude sometimes and not come down no matter how long you wait. I’ve had to run from a few who refused to go down 
---
I was literally about to launch the nuke on Prime a few nights ago (would have the first nuke I personally targeted/launched), DC'd while I was using the terminal. I was pissed, but it was probably time to go to bed anyway. The ammo lost getting to that point is what really stung.
---
I've done all my silo runs solo so far (first at lvl 60ish, last yesterday lvl 125 )and it's really not a big deal. It's time consuming, that's all. Take a decent firearm and melee weapon, one or better two handful stimpacks and maybe a PA with you and you're fine. Try not to stay in one sector for too long as the robots will respawn after some time.
---
Good hunting!
---
Pharma Farma (Luck Perk) is an active search used on First Aid, Chem boxes for extra stuff. 
---
Many times it can be 2 or 3 extra items depending on your luck.
---
Scrounger and similar perks (pharma farms, can do) arent passive, they require you to search the container with a prompt (triangle on ps4)
---
Yeah but I just don't want like the explosive effect especially when someone has it on a automatic weapon and steals all the kills
---
&gt; you could make 30% of the time 8x deluded Stimpaks
---
Deluded Stimpaks... This is a chem I need.
---
Three times now I've seen a set of power armor sitting in the road somewhere but I can never do anything with it.  If I look at it I just get the transfer screen with the rotating arrows like it's trying to load something but it never stops.
---
Woah woah, watch the magic 
---
very true,
---
A fool and his money are soon parted
---
It's bad verbiage, but he was referring to character stash vs stash box. 
---

---
The DMV is there...
---
....’nuff said. 
---
You've actually made me think about this aspect of the story more, and now I realise it's actually really dumb.
---
Imagine you're in a vault which is about to be opened. For the best chances of survival do you
---
a) Make everyone work together to set up a new settlement of a few hundred people, pooling your resources, creating a strong defence, and building a community with the overseer at the head
---
or 
---
b) Send the overseer out on their own ahead of everyone else, with no help at all into a completely unknown world, and send everyone else in the vault out in groups of 1-4 to fight and kill eachother and to create at best tiny bases.
---
It would really make more sense if the setup was more along the lines of the player being a refugee from Washington where raiders had ravaged their property. When they enter WV they find it more intact than the Capital Wastelands, but deserted other than for a few people and these weird creatures called the scorched. They then begin to investigate what happened etc, etc.
---
So someone dropped a nuke on whitesprings last night, shocking I know. 
---
I was cleaning out my inventory while the group was making the rounds a 3* came out of nowhere. 
---
I did what any reasonable person would have done and fired a flare up in the air, tagged the mob and then just talked it. Figured I’d wait a minute or so before giving up and just killing it. But to my surprise the group came back when they saw the flare! 
---
First time for everything I suppose 
---
I saw a really neat one built into the side of a cliff,  I went to check it out but the doors were locked.  I then jumped down the lowest part and my impact broke the wall open. Or so I thought.  
---
Now that I think more about it I was trying to find the exact point where the treasure map picture was taken/drawn.
---
I wonder if that was the point it was taken from?
---
I will look into it when I decide to make another treasure map run with all my maps.
---
Add me! I normally play quite a bit, although I'll be out of town for a few weeks for work. Level 112? Something like that. I mainly explore and do events, so hope you aren't too PVP oriented! 
---
Unless it's bounties or grief hunting! Always down for that! 
---
Raynesidius is my gamertag. Should have led with that 
---
Same experience for me. I love talking to people but the way the voicechat works is shit. 
---
Atoms well spent.
---
Teleport. 
---
This is helpful. Thanks.
---
You're not my supervisor! Now I'll go nuke Camden park!
---
Wow thanks! 
---
I am amazed we got an official response 0.0
---
If hair clipping is an issue with the glass globe part of the helmet or that connector seal ring at the collar - I totally don’t mind for the helmet AND the collar seal ring to be model-merged and made removable 
---
I really love that suit :)  
---
Find 2 or more people who appear to be working together. Run up to them and say "Hey you all know you're talking in area chat right?"
---
Hilarious stuff.
---
I could see why that would suck but does it *actually* happen that often? I find it hard to believe that someone with a TSE is consistently showing up at events of all things right at the end. 
---
To be fair, your comment isn't spoilered either. Though by the &gt; I think you may have tried.
---
But yes, her story is very disjointed and all over the place, it really makes it hard to follow. It's a shame, because I really like her character and I hope we get to meet her in the future, though a part of me thinks she'll be a mutated monstrosity of a final boss in a future dlc. 
---
what is slap damage? Damage after armor effect? 
---
It does that at a thousand maps. They were duped. Happened to others to that never recovered from it. 
---
Even while locked away in a vault, one truth stands the test of time. Sex sells. 
---
Emerging from the dimly lit vault, Johnny Shit-Knuckles will put his finely honed skills to the test, equipped with only 'fist' weapons. 
---
Either an instigating one or bloodied 
---
Damn, i Just bought one for 4k :(
---
I just saw a post about someone’s cliffside workshop you should check it out
---
Good Lord man, just turn off the 9 quests you are not messing with and put like 3 up that sort go together.  You don't need to have the work shop claim mission up for a few hours just because you walked near it.
---
In the same position. So thank you for asking the question and also to all who replied 
---
Thank you mate
---
You should use some Atoms on a fresh cap! 
---
They are the only half-affordable items on there 
---
I tried that and sometimes I spawn where I want and other times I do not.  is this some sort of Almond joy commercial? 
---
Probably one of my earliest photos of my character mere seconds before being incinerated by a fully charged assaultron
---
I found one of these in the southeast. I detonated it. Basically a mini nuke

---
Find them all over on armour frames and generators 
---
What you on?
---
I didn't even have 1000 maps.  This is annoying and hopefully I can figure this out
---
Bloodied is about 80% more damage at 20% hp, which is already more than twice what you get from Anti-Armor. Throw in Adrenal Reaction and optionally Nerd Rage and it's far beyond any other 1-star effect.
---
Lol 
---
It doesn't seem to be very popular in this subreddit, but I really like the vampire effect (every hit you gain a portion of health back). If I could find one with 40% swing speed/vampire, I'd pretty much be set.
---
If you're on PC and don't mind a one-star, I do have a vampire effect Grognak I'd be willing to part with.
---
I think it spawns inside of Pricketts Fort but don’t quote me on it, but I’ve seen some civil war era clothing there for sure. 
---
And I just covered my monitor at work with Coffee! 
---
LOL
---
It happens frequently enough that it's frustrating. We're hitting the point of the game's life where people are farming the meta locations. It may not always be last second, but surprise TSE looters make events a hassle. We just need private servers...
---
&gt; Pure melee build here at its always 50 / 50 if the damn things land or if i give up
---
I feel you're pain, I'm in the same boat. I considered finding a weapon that could carry me without perk investment, but when I look at the mutations I'll have later on I'm not going to hit anything.. :/
---
You'd think that with 16 times the level of detail they could have gotten that working.
---
That's what I'm saying that, that Explosive should be a 'first star' not 'second star' effect
---
Ok, I just realized that a couple days ago when I was watching a video :(
---
The event that sealed it for me that this was a cash grab were the $24 dollar Christmas emotes (discounted to $12 lol). For that price one would expect new animations, etc something really nice that justifies the price based on the effort required to create the content. When it turned out that all they replaced were the gifs that showed over your head... work an intern could jam out in photoshop in a day or so. Well, it's gross... that rises to the level of Christmas freebie in a game launched at $60 a month prior. The game may be a service but my wallet isn't and this feemium model is a sword they seem willing to die on. If they want to be Fortnight and drain you at both ends, they could at least have the decency to put in the same level of effort as Epic does.
---
Just one is needed - I sit on the hood of the bus and tag the Glowing when they come out and love watching the arcs go from guy to guy lighting up what is future XP for me :) - however I've sadly sold my Tesla, went into pacifist mode and now just pop them off with my two handed sniper with a 40 cap mag and hit left and right to highlight them all and get at least 1 shot off.
---
All I ever get are sweepstakes prizes and Nanny stories.
---
5 of us using two shot 50s killed the Queen in the air in less time than it took for it to say Finished Death From Above . I know 3 were using prime receivers. It was by far the fastest kill I had partaken in and it happened so fast I did not think to record it.   
---
Most of the time it is me and one other that have the 50 cals out and the queen drops pretty quick but not like what happened yesterday.   
---
Get adrenal mutation it acts like bloodied and AA might come in a solid second but nothing takes the huge gray chunks out of her like the two shot. 
---
At 142, my stocks are littered with cards that are dupes or that I don't want.  Card pack luck has not been on my side.  I really hope they institute some kind of recycling system.
---
well, there's already dismemberment of some corpses like mole rats
---
I like to roam around, help others, and find C.A.M.P. plans 
---
GT: Fluffercow
---
Alright, troll. You're far too dumb to be going back forth with.
---
Look at your karma and comment history. Your thoughts and opinions are generally quite unpopular and also commonly devolve into these types of exchanges.
---
You're obviously a child, but also a moron. Again, good day. 
---
it'd probably be really buggy and not work properly I imagine
---
Great info to know. I'm only 4 levels below being able to use the power armor pieces I've collected, and they've been taking up too much space in my stash.
---
The real question is where do you find Max level 3 star legendaries to farm.  
---
Getting annoying that they are dropping no legendaries or sub-star legendaries.  Hard enough to find them and get a good roll on 3 star perks for a relevant weapon as it stands.
---
It depends on how old a thing your using and if it's a 'display' only page, or a page with things that need to do logic/math
---
Hrmm - Yeah that's my concern: finding another piece(s) that boosts my sneak up to 20/25% like the dress does. Right now, even before the mutation, it was a perfect outfit for me. Unless I get hit, then it sucks, but generally my approach is to sneak sniper the heck of them and never let them see me which works about 90% of the time.
---
Nope, I want to say it was mid-bottom right of the map? (To the right of whitesprings, near the overhead monorail?)
---
I could be off on the exact location, going off memory
---
I’m pretty sure I’m in full screen boarderless... I have zero issues. Hell I run two clients simultaneously and alt-tab between them as well as to a browser, so far I haven’t noticed any issues related to that (I get an occasional client crash or endless loading screen, but those happen with just one client and no tabbing too, so I’m not attributing it)
---
I've been leaving stuff at the overseers camp as often as possible.
---
Like the guy trapped inside the fridge at Flatwoods. He couldn’t have been in there more than a few hours before we found him...
---
Shut Up!
---
i did not!
---
They could add in a code that turns all multiples of legendary base weapons and armor in to cloth. Say someone had 3 tse pump shotguns. One being hardened and one prime. The code recognizes this and wipes two of the three guns from the game. It'd be enough to drive dupers away because they just lost their inventory. Of course I wouldn't want this implemented until duping is fixed and no longer possible.
---
Yeah, I got all 3 of them into that big field (from the gif) and they weren't having any of it. At one point I was just running around in the most open spaces I could find, I had assumed landing space was a factor, and nothing.
---
There’s nothing above it. It’s a floor connected to a floor on the same level connected to a floor on the bottom level by a staircase. Can’t scrap neither of them
---
I just hit level 70 this weekend and I have entered Nuke zones and I also launched my first Nuke on Saturday all of which I have done solo and I have done all of this with weapons and gear that I have crafted. I have stuck with my tried and true sneak, snipe method I have used in previous Fallout games. I do have some of the quest related legendaries plus a few melee wepons that I have acquired (\*all but one have been unused and discarded at various vendor location containers.) I have not completed the main storyline or most of the side missions because I am in no rush to do so. Likely 1/2 of my XP and levels are from building and relocating my camp because I love moving around and I love the building aspect of the game. As a result I have had a blast playing playing FO76 and I am glad that others are as well.
---
\*Near the end of my solo silo run after all of my ranged weapons were broken it came down to hand to robot face combat. Luckily the only legendary melee weapon I did not discard was a sword with +30% damage to robots and without it I would have failed. It was an exciting battle for sure.
---
...no ones gonna say it?
---
*Fine.*
---
Theres another settlement that needs your help.
---
they turn you into a newt
---
watch out
---
PS4... same issue.  The specs are what they are.  Question is - does the PS Pro do any better performance wise with this?
---
I agree
---
Definitely not a problem to solo. I've solo'd my entire time in 76 without difficulty (two characters both level 50+). 
---
I've not yet fought the Scorchbeast queen, but that's probably the only thing you'd really need a group for. You can even solo most/all of the events in the game, although some can be a real pain in the ass when you do them alone. (Manageable, but annoying.)
---
Random encounters used to be the way to farm the coolest guns in previous Fallout games, save often and when you find one load and go to it over and over until the alien pops up
---
You shooting them wings? 
---
Are there plans for those? I’d love to get a hold of an enclave uniform.
---
Don't shoot for "over powered", shoot for "appropriately powered". Once you hit level 25, craft a level 25 gun. Rifles are good early-game weapons.
---
To be honest once you hit lvl 35 you'll be able to start getting better weapons as you can invest in perk cards to boost their attacks easily by then.
---
Normally not too many problems for me but had it crash twice in the first 5 minutes while trying to access my stash yesterday and same thing although further apart the day before.
---
Thin red line could be Serendipity.  Lots of pvp players run it.
---
To get them to land you need enough clearing in front of you for them to land and melee hit you. Shooting them in the wing can also cripple it and cause them to land if there is room. The best idea when you can't tank their attack is to shoot their wing from within cover then move to a clearing so they land quickly. That said they need serious work I hate the visual effects on their attack so much.
---
Can confirm marathon an the happy camper don't work in PA while in your own CAMP. Tested happy camper a lot recently. Still flying through food if I try an stay in PA. Out of PA pretty much never need to eat while in CAMP.
---
Unless they buff it considerably with future updates, you didn't miss anything aside from the veil.  (gas mask protection without a perception hit).  Even if they gave it the FO4 ballistic weave treatment with 110 resist, half decent legendary armors would still be way better.  You can't wear it under armor, which is a shame.  I'm into diversity, but the lack of a masculine version of the outfit bothered me a bit.  I have no problem with crossdressing, but I don't want to be forced into it because a certain quest reward (which requires you to spend caps of time to travel all over the map) that might be really great requires me to wear a skirt.  It really should have been a more gender neutral outfit, which could have been so easy to do.
---
I saw Grafton vendors selling this plan earlier for me
---
I agree with you there. If I buy weapons I check and make sure the person I'm buying from has only the one weapon or no other signs of duping. If I'm buying a tse double barrel for example. If they have 15 of them or 15 other tse I walk away. If it's their only one of that type I will more than likely consider buying it
---
Dupes first.
---
The Atom Store is my vice 😅 
---
I've seen the datamined pics and I know good stuff coming. Challenges are easy enough. 
---
There are several issues/ updates/ additions they could focus on, all reported by a caring community right here on reddit.
---
But what they do? Updates on the atom shop.
---
Sometimes it feels like Bethesda is not putting the right amount of resources into the game. The recent nukes bug shows it perfectly.
---
So much potential wasted. And the promises of neverending new content and updates that fail to come.
---
In the end it just seems like F76 is a minimum effort game. 
---
Agreed. I never had a disconnection problem till this morning. 
---
Just a quick reminder to people who complain about how other people choose to play the game: 
---
Mind your own damn business. 
---
Quick everybody post pictures of your houses
---
I was hoping it was a Speed reference or Die Hard with a Vengance or something where they say "ALWAYS/NEVER CUT THE &lt;COLOR&gt; WIRE"
---
Yyyyeeesssss!!!
---
It's so annoying! It's honestly the only bug that... Well... Bugs me. 
---
Bloodied swing speed +1 str or instigating power attack +1 str
---
Grats man!  First time is always amazing.
---
Just don't be like me and do nothing but complain about no one else doing any damage while blowing myself up on ghouls.
---
Oh, that's awesome. I never realized the "upgrades" were categories, as opposed to links to specific armor types. (Even if the "category" is one item, like the Marine Wetsuit or Vault suit.)
---
It's probably like the worn veil in the Mistress of Mystery quest. You have to wear it when you go to the location for the quest to update.
---
Literal slideshows as in 1 fps? I get that in indoor areas like blackwater water mine after playing for hours. It's completely gone if I restart my complete system.
---
I don't want to scream LEAK! yet, but I'm running nothing but the game, the launcher and mumble. No overlays or additional security tools that could possibly interfere.
---
My specs are really low, maybe that's why hardly anyone else has this issue? (8gigs ram, 2gigs vram)
---
Yep did that, looked, watched some lower levels try to get to him.  Then checked their profile to ensure there 10 Cap wanted was likely a missed shot and their Achievements matched their LVL.  I'd come across a couple who did that yesterday.  Thus guy after I left him alive asked me to come kill him.  Hence helping him out.
---
Dude, I'll be home in like 6 hours and on all night if you wouldnt mind making me one. I'll even throw caps your way for the generosity.
---
Kadav6
---
It was a sarcastic remark, poking fun at the whole market being ruined, which is mostly the result of dupers.  I don't care what you sell them for.
---
Erm. 
---
For my 2nd playthrough I had a lvl 1, upgraded pipe revolver. That was more than enough to get me to lvl 10 with ease. 
---
At lvl 10, I had a lvl 10 upgraded pipe revolver. That was more than enough to lvl 18
---
Since then I’ve been using a Lvl 5 Summerset Special and a lvl 15 Black Diamond. Currently lvl 24. 
---
In short, you don’t need OP weapons at your level. 
---
Ahahahah that was a thing :) 
---
Do the enclave quest :)
---
lol exactly. Limited time only! Boy they screwed up not getting a cut of all trades tho like in CS GO. 
---
A few questions on that low level character for the handmade plans (just started mine yesterday) if you don't mind:
---
So it is taking longer to level up than I remember? I only got the character up to level 6 when I figured I could probably hit 12-15 no problem based on my first character's progression at the beginning.
---
Are handmade plans common enough at the vendors who have them to accumulate them quickly (when your 15-19)? I am hoping to get them for my buddies and a few to sell.
---
Is there any other way to transfer things between characters than trading items to someone else and having them trade the items back to you? Are drop trades viable if you can rejoin the server, or does your paper bag despawn when you leave the server?
---
Any tips/info are appreciated!
---
Im all for sandbox mechanics, It's the sole reason I made it this long(500hr+). Issue is the gross advantage that certain players have due to an exploit that has effectively made them  immune to escalating cost of mats with higher lvl weapons/armor.  
---
Lets use a scenario we all may have experienced: fixing a gun, 9 springs for a handmade. We should all have \~180 springs in our stash, we mange our number to avoid having too many of one thing. Duper bro had 1mil lb, obviously not all that is springs but lets say 1% of that is springs, thats 100k springs. 
---
 The  duper in question had that almost a month ago, duping is still a thing, logic tells me this guy likely has more than any one of us will ever have, in our entire time playing fo76 combined. Thats just one guy, yea if they can't ban him or his cronies/pawns because they lack the tools, then a full wipe would at least give us a level playing field. 
---
Not to mention the nuke colas that were duped for near infinite caps, used to buy all the plans, thus protecting them from "just take away their stuff"
---
Melee super mutants. Bladed pretty much anything hurts them.
---
No problemo! I'll be whipping up a lot of them just in case.
---
We're about do you live what level are ya
---
They probably haven't realized the difference between Drop and Deploy yet ...:~)
---
I believe the wire to cut matches the color on the tail fin of a given nuke. Could be wrong though, I had no idea what I was doing the first time, and the second time could have been luck.
---
Can you share the locations? I'd love to see them
---
That would almost cause Flares to become a form of flying mounts
---
Blazemarko99 add me
---
such an awesome game mechanic
---
Play a recording of the Scorchbeast wings off your phone through the mic
---
It would be cool if mini nukes gave you flora though.
---
bethesda *is* qualified but it's a *really* tall order for DLC that complicated. a whole new map, new story, new mechanics. what would they do with the original map? how would they implement revisiting it? it's basically making a whole new game.
---
East cost 98 or 99
---
I really haven't any issues with this. I think I have been kicked off a server once or twice. 
---
Don't forget adrenal gland and Twisted Muscles :-)
---
Not really, you shouldn't be collecting anything you can't use that isn't super rare.  PA is everywhere, there is 0 reason to collect it.
---
I don't know if it's because I watched too much Black Mirror but I will entertain this theory.  I was always conscious of the time &amp; date in the Fallout games ever since Fo3 when my birthday coincided  with Fo3's date AND taking that kid to Big Town and receiving a birthday hat as a reward.  I assumed that the game was online and pulled my information to make that quest appear on the appropriate date.  Could have been coincidence.  Most likely.
---
However, on playing Fo76, I found myself observing the dates never going past the 26th for me and why it kept resetting.  This simulation idea is pretty wild.  I wonder.... 
---
the fact that bethesda called workshop items DLC in FO4 was ridiculous too. I don't have a lot of hopes for future content. We'd get more content in one month of modding and private servers than in 5 years of development from BGS. I want servers. 
---
Imagine the shitshow if we had a global auctioning system
---
nice but not the one I saw, this one had the starting brick at the top of the cliff, and then stairs going down towards the water of the canyon, and he built it down 3 or 4 floors, it was pretty neat.
---
It's sad, but it is also simple and effective for dealing with problematic player interactions. It's far, far, far better than some of the crazy (and hugely punitive, and often petty) suggestions you see in these threads.
---
Going somewhere else is often the ultimate safely valve in games as it is in real life.
---
Random even my alt has seen. There is a ton of these random events all about the map. Happy hunting.
---
There was a daily a while ago to take a picture at a rift.  I found what I thought was an undefended one, went up to it, went into photomode, and ate a faceful of scorchbeast spam from one that was clipped down into the rift.  Here's the resulting pic:

Fortnite Save the World is very nostalgic to Fallout 76.

PVE Co-Op, Semi-open world, farm loot, build your Home Base, etc.

Doesn't it match the color on the tail fin?

How many turrets did he have and was his base located at the golf course or outside of the blast zone ? Was  he really killing all the enemies, surely the area is large ?

It would become a problem if someone got, lets say, a limited time PA paint job and then started offering to paint peoples power armor for some price per frame. 
---
Absolutely this. I just don't understand why there is so much hate. I'm gonna chalk it up to not having one. 
---
End game pvp? Melee builds murdered before anyway so if that wasn't what you had, we'll get fucked. 
---
End game pve? Sorry not sorry I don't enjoy dumping 200+ rounds into my enemies while trying to back peddle or stand on objects out of reach so I don't get stuck in a perpetual staggering animation. My character uses semi weapons, and bullets should hurt. I'd probably stop using my TSE if Plasma rifles weren't a joke. Even with my TS Lever action it's still a joke. 
---
Sure I only use my TSE for big fights, but what's the alternative? Waste literally hundreds of rounds on bullet sponges and hope during the fight that: 
---
1. A random SB doesn't show up.
---
2. My game crashes.
---
3. A ranged enemy gives me a disease.
---
4. I get locked in a staggering animation.
---
5. My enemy vanishes but manages to still deal damage to me.
---
6. The enemy actually becomes immune to damage. 
---
7. The game lags and I get murdered. 
---
8. An event starts, summoning more mobs.
---
9. Another player enters the area, triggering the respawn on area mobs. 
---
10. I'm shot by enemies who have a literal infinite amount of ammo.
---
Just saying.
---
Rad x or rad away?
---
Crazy. How many enemies would you estimate are in the silos when you try to launch?
---
Om nom nom spam. 
---
Thank, i believe it would bring peace to this world. 
---
LOL. Bethesda would be upset. Player X buys something that could cost real money and then hooks up all his friends - how is Bethesda going to benefit off of the one purchase?
---
It’s a meme... umm... not here to flex levels...
---
Found my double barrel Shotgun TSE on dumb luck, not even farming legendaries or anything. Would have preferred a rifle of sorts so I didn't have to retool my build for shotguns but I'm not complaining.
---
I played about an hour and had no issues
---
What type of good stuff are you expecting? A level 50 Hazmat Suit isn't really going to help you much until ... Level 50.
---
Fair enough. Not sure how dupers affect serums though honestly unless that's where the recipes came from. 
---
We need Oxhorn showing us all the random encounters. Didnt know tons of them in Fo4 before i saw his videos. 
---
I killer several Legendaries yesterday but their corpses would just show their regular name and no exceptional loot. 
---
nah just scrap that shit. you'll find more when you are the appropriate level.
---
dude imagine the rig needed to simulate all this! it might even be able to run at 60fps while fighting scorchbeasts!
---
Im not a high level but im looking to get XP ,PSN OtakuPsycho xx
---
This is an honest question and I promise I'm not trying to troll. I know rads heals ghouls - does it heal the SBQ too?
---
I'm just going to start calling it all twisted adrenal nerd glands
---
I'm old, I don't meme but I do flex
---
Ah. Console. Can't help there. Tbh I'm not sure if optimization will do anything. Because it's a massive terrain, weather, npc and creature shift all at once. 
---
What level are you?
---
We need a update. Havent had one forever it feels like
---
The only lvl 95 is the queen 
---
They would make more money from the crafters buying all of the paints rather than everyone buying just one thing they want I think
---
I agree with the food and water. It seems to deplete at a fast rate. If they could slow that down a bit it would be really helpful. Maybe make it drain slower if you fill the food and water meters in one sitting. Like having a nice full belly. 
---
Well I am currently following a level 39 around helping him/her kill ghouls lol
---
But I’m down for anything. 
---
Heh I like it.
---
I'm lvl 150 xx_glichekid_xx 
---
Yeah, hid in a house and even swapped in the vats limb-target perk to do it, along with the limb crippling perk for rifles and the one for shotguns. I spent about 300-400 rounds with a TSE rifle (shots, not hits).
---
I have been getting the eternal loading screen problem. Have to exit game via Task Manager and even then with fo76 is listed as active using 78% of my memory.
---
It's pain when everytime you FT or zone into an area you have a 15% chance of locking up the game.
---
Oh man! Thank you. 
---
You don't have flying death bats where you are? 
---
Remember when they added an additional 200? Initially it was 400, but they said theyd do 200 first to make sure servers would stay stable then theyd implement the remaining half
---
Ugh, for the millionth time it’s “Taint &amp; Scrotum Expander”
---
I used one of the power plants. Managed to keep it for a whole play session and ended up with like 20 cores. After that, I find enough just galavanting around to sustain myself. I honestly try to burn through them cause they take up so much room. Still have like 15 in my stash.
---
But "all of the crafters" would not buy "all of the paints". Crafter A would buy paint A. Crafter B would buy paint B. Etc.
---
BGS would hamstring their own shop if they let this happen, so it never will.
---
34 year old dad here and your group sounds like a fun and laid back one to join. Ok if I send you an invite? Don’t want to just assume it’s ok to add you.
---
GT PapaHotDog
---
And your nephew sounds like my little cousin I play battlefield with. Lol I text my uncle and he sorts him out as well 
---
Ash Heap south between the Overseers spot, the train yard and all around the Huge excavator. There are 5 fusion generators around that area more or less. Don't forget the room where the overseer's fiance is in, fusion generator in there. AMS headquarters in the bog has 3-4 some behind level 2 locks
---
Does it immediately detonate or is there a timer? I hope it would immediately detonate
---
What did they even do? I've noticed the weirdest bugs since then. Trying to pick up loot or flowers, its like the cursor is off target by a smidge sometimes. Also all the vendor bots are nearly dead for me even though nothing attacks them.
---
true but you still spawn outside the mine, so i just grabbed a ton of toxic water to chug kn the way in. plus theres a cap stash that spawns on a barrel on the way there
---
I'm going to call it as some sort of screw up by your router's UPnP settings.  When you changed the interface from one interface to another (hence wired to wireless) it triggered the UPnP to update and fix the conflict.  I've seen this happen and the cheap routers that the ISPs give you usually are pretty good with this - however once in a while they need to be slapped a bit to get fixed.  Next time before switching the connection type (because wired will always be better), try rebooting the router first.  That might fix things as easily.
---
Not true. Hunter/hunted, monster mash, civil war are all penalty free just atore your junk and have fun. In the world is another story. 
---
If you have a bounty, expect the hunters especially if you click "seek revenge". Its honestly cheaper to just bounce out of server. 
---
If you want to earn back whats yours then fight for it but realize you are gonna likely just lose more caps 
---
but he was referring to (inventory) vs stash. -FTFY
---
Ye man always welcome a hand If ya fancy it add me 
---
Well, never said I was a trend setter lol. Moron, maybe. You been talking down to someone that had to go to LD classes for English and spelling. But even this moron can tell you that first paragraph/sentence looks off. So yeah, you were right from the get go. I am not good at spelling what so ever. Thanks though for running your mouth, been a good laugh how sad some people are.
---
Will be on soon
---
Rough. I find with my tse shotgun that when they start hovering close i can hit them then 
---
I cut the red wire and got a crapload of loot.  
---
How does this duper personally affect you? There is zero meaningful competition in FO76 so you can make the game arbitrarily hard or easy for yourself with zero consequence. Its basically a Coop-ish PVE game with no economy. It's like whining about people who save edit in borderlands 2. It's a none issue unless you take issue.
---
Again, who cares if they have all of this stuff? It doesn't impact you at all. It only becomes an issue if they try to add a real economy or serious PVP, but they won't so it's moot.
---
What doing a hard reset does is alienate a large number of people who ground hard in this game, and then got shit on because something is bothering you. This game is seriously on life support. A reset would be like shooting it in the back of the head and dumping the body in a ditch.
---
Are scorched and scorch beast in the same class as ghoals?
---
Neither, he’s invulnerable but his DPS is too low to kill her before her timer runs out. Although... with the way HP scaling on the queen works, if we are literally talking 1v1 and no one else around... maybe?
---
Thanks I'll go check it out.
---
Once they fix PVP and base mechanics sure.  Right now both are broken.  
---
I can one shot anyone at any time currently.  That's not skill, it's just "click dead, click dead".  PVP should have skill.
---
Also bases are laughably easy to destroy.  They need an extreme makeover to enable any type of base raid / PVP dynamics to the game.
---
I craft them to get rid of my Bloodpacks! 
---
Congratulations! I had my first SB kill Wednesday night! I had taken over the mega red rocket and it was part of the second wave that I needed to defend. My CAMP was nearby, turrets were all over and firing so I thought it was the best time to give it a go.  I had just filled up my exploding machine gun and 10mm flaming sub machine gun and went to town. Burned through a lot of ammo, lots of damaged equipment but having multiple turrets really helped keep it busy.  Got some okay items, not nearly as bad as others have gotten. 
---
First time I’ve ever run out of steel when I went back to try to make more ammo. 
---
As a semi-related aside, I noticed that my push-to-talk keybind had reverted to default at some point.  So all the times I cheerfully responded to a "Heya, Fish!" I was apparently talking to myself.  Sigh.  
---
I'm not the first to mention this, but it'd be nice if there was an personal audio indicator that showed up in first person view.  Would save me from neurotically flipping to third-person and making "Is this thing on?" noises, anyway.
---
Thanks for the info everyone, I had the same question
---
Oh, shit. I thought I blocked you already.
---
My mistake. Bye bye troll. 
---
the simulation could be based on the outside conditions to prepare people for what is out there... Think about how big Far Harbor and Nuka World were... All of the Fallout 4 DLC added a LOT to the game...  I haven't even done a raider character to engage with the raider radiant quests...
---
Well I don't think it's that they *can't* do that, they just have not. Probably trying to limit their PR disasters. 
---
98 or 99. 
---
If you are in a team, of which you should always be in a team, have one person put on Level 3 red sponge and share it to an another person put on Level 3 ghoulish and share it. No rad x, no rad away, no stimpacks.
---
It's so fantastic it's almost broken. Me and my team's run around this anywhere we are going to be near radiation. Only time you have to pop a stimpack is if you get directly meleed by a wendigo deathclaw or Scorch Beast.
---
And doing so, everything carries over to other servers correct? So if I have a settlement it would look the same just doesn’t have the conflict with other players correct?
---
Didn't fix anything for me, I pointed out what he had said. Go fix it for the OP.
---
Right? I was shitting my pants all the way down
---
It is also the quest that stops all of the robots from actively hunting you down.
---
But I still actively hunt them down if they are hurting my friend Phoenix.
---
Completely off topic, but that cloth is taking up a lot of space
---
failed attempt at /r/beetlejuicing ?
---
Phoenix sells mods and plans on occasion. 
---
If you’re on ps4 and have a torso plus the mats I can craft a t51b jetpack. Here’s a list of what’s required. 
---
5 stable cobalt flux(I have none, you’ll need to provide these)
---
5 stable violet flux(can provide at 80c a piece)
---
17 Adhesive (Running low, may need you to provide)
---
24 aluminum (running low, may need you to provide)
---
14 asbestos(I have)
---
9 nuclear material(I have)
---
I’ll charge 2500c to craft but will knock off 250c if you trade plans that I need as well. (Examples; rare weapons, decon shower, power armor plans, certain mods, ect.) 
---
I’ll also negotiate for good legendary heavy weapons, laser rifles, or +int armor. 
---
Gamertag: Synbios Blade
---
Will be home Sunday I typically play after kids go to bed so around 7:30 est.  Only thing I dont really do is PvP I'm up for anything else.  
---
Level 39 and I'm still rockn' that gun with a holo sight.
---
This is actually the first Bethesda game where i havent had the urge to dupe or do an infinite xp glitch. I wish I could find an infinite source of Stims but i'm not gonna cheat for them lol.
---
Yeah, I had a non-TSE shotgun on me, had a hope that my 'Enforcer' perk would proc and cripple a wing but didn't happen. Had to ADS for it as well, could only get 20% accuracy in vats with the shotgun.
---
Hahah oh man. I got some salty guys after I found/joined that event the first time. I didn’t know much about it but I DID read the prompts, it’s a PVP event... they got real upset once the shooting started. I was cool and didn’t loot their junk, but they were still damn grumpy. 
---
I do them twice a day. Prefer solo tbh. Faster and less messy. Can do them in bout 15 mins 
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
Yeah, try saying that when you and two other friends, level 90+, launch a nuke to spawn a scorchbeast queen (SBQ) and every other player in the server fast travels to her location at level 30 and you end up not killing SBQ because her health scales to the number of players participating in the event. 
---
Anyone wants to see my trading post an workshop down by the junk pile west end of map right above sunshine food. I've got a fully operational shop front, open extractor an farm for people to grab food an materials to head into the workshop to repair an heal up. Or my home with one or the best views in game. Has everything one could need. Add me in game Enzth on PC. I'm online pretty much every night PST.  Will be adding a lot of pictures to settlement subreddit later tonight if you're interested in taking a look not on PC.
---
I have a Netgear Nighthawk.. Is that a common problem with these also?
---
This is what I though we were doing. Seems the flatwoods cash register seems to be more popular. 
---
Sssshhhhhh ;)
---
Yeah you gotta pick and shoot your moments. Thats why i bought myseld an explosive galting 
---
Most of the high level ones give a chance at rare plans.
---
All Boss events.  Uranuim Fever, Census Violence, Violent Night are the biggie's.  Workshop events are good for quite a while as I think they always drop a plan.
---
time doesn't pass when you fast travel because you're on an MP server, so a single player fast travelling can't change the time because that'd mess everyone else up. the old respawn system used saves, which don't work in an MP game for obvious reasons.
---
It's been getting worse and worse over the last couple of weeks for me (PC, solid connection, decent/modern rig, etc.). I'm not going to say "OMG DUPERS" or anything, but *something* is making things worse, and I've been playing a lot less because of it.
---
Also, babies. One year old likes mice and keyboards. So I turned them off. Went to change two year old. Came back. One year old had turned both mouse and keyboard back on*,* and I am now the proud owner of Astroturf and an emoji I have yet to use.
---
Though come to think of it, the cat *was* sitting on the chair, just over her shoulder...
---
These challenges are so weird sometimes.  I cleared the other one for collecting an audio tape just by logging in, since I guess that grunting noise my character makes is her entire inventory getting dumped on her and one of her audiotapes counted?  But the game also has me at 1/76 animal kills forever.
---
YES. Hell... I am level 125 and there is still stuff I haven't explored. I'm having a blast. 
---
Yep i get that too. Sometimes even when just trying to deliberately leave the server I get frozen on the loading screen lol.
---
The problem was solved by a reboot.  No idea how a reboot could affect game loading, but there you have it.
---
At least you get that.  Sometimes I just get that spinning wheel.
---
Well, I started as a vats/gunslinger/hoarder so I had max luck and agility, but I also had 10 strength for weight perks. I switched to unarmed after someone gave me a power first and I accidentally picked up some mutations. Pushed strength to 15, dropped the weight perks for melee perks. Still have fairly high luck and agility, but I might shave those down a bit, to have more than 1 endurance. I have level 1 or 2 in a lot of the luck perks, action not, etc.. Gun Fu maxed out.
---
I'm more curious how overweight were you (your FO character, not you personally) :-)
---
I was once 200 over because a piece of my armor broke and I was "glitching" with the 405 weigh limit bug the Excavator armor sometimes has and I could carry 190 tops without it.  But all I had was an AP issue trying to get back to CAMP and praying I didn't run into any Legendaries on the way.
---
Only had one, it was just lurking there at the middle of the cave, tried to sneak to the transponder but aventually she saw me haha.
---
Oh, she triggered a bunch of Scorched too.
---
It crashes your game twice as fast, I believe.
---
If you are doing it for the quest, it’s not worth 1k caps. Sure you have enough time to fight but it lags so bad that the queen takes little to no damage. Or you get kicked. Hopefully the next update fixes this. Good luck though!
---
Why is this post blank? Mods should delete it 
---
you might want to retry your spoiler tag, it's not working
---
Ummm.. Yep. Definitely doing this.
---
Should have used a trebuchet 
---
No idea man... must be some kind of glitch I hope. SURELY it’s not happening for the mods as well 🤫
---
I understand that, luckily i was in powerarmor with a supersledge that does 111 damage.
---
But you just reused incorrect terms that confused the person you were replying to. So I fixed it for all of you, really. There is no character stash, It is simply inventory.
---
They should do what they do in Elder Scrolls Online.  Reward caps for cards that you already have (maxed out in this situation.
---
ESO does this for crown store items by providing gems that you can save up to buy a specific reward outright. 
---
Why is that bad?  I do this too but I try to use relevant songs so it's not too jarring and out of place.  People I have come across either walk with me for a few songs or fast travel away.
---
yep :O
---
you get better though
---
I like... dont get it!
---
&gt; But what they do? Updates on the atom shop.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Sometimes it feels like Bethesda is not putting the right amount of resources into the game.
---
The programmers updating the game engine are not the same people as the graphic artists making skins for the Atomic Shop. 
---
I'm not saying prgrammers can't draw, but programmers can't draw.
---
I agree. Not sure why you’re being downvoted. Unless you found some rare pieces or something it’s pointless. 
---
Using chems drains them out faster. While I'm not 100% on it, I think also refiling your AP out of Power Armor (in PA uses cores) burns extra.
---
If you're finding it particularly a nuisance, just grabbing lead belly and cannibal is a solid option, then you can drink from any water and eat corpses on the fly. Don't even have to open your inventory and you save on carry weight.
---
I’m called the preacher man. Just because I run round in the priest outfit with a shotgun and help the less fortunate( Lower level players )
---
Toilet Paper
---
Theres one spot upside river from Silo alpha , at the start point of it 
---
U can do it or some1 U know? Cos I only know some1 who has Paladin paint and Sentinel will be better:D
---
How do I make it hide the link? It's blacked out, but still shows through? Should I just delete the like?
---
Thanks, we killed it with the three of us, it took 40 mins. It didnt fly away when the event failed for some reason
---
I think the holotape voice acting has been excellent. 
---
Raiders are, remember, idiots. They are not cool. Always been portrayed as morons. Your description sounds spot-on and appropriate. 
---
Done! 
---
Mine was 10 rabbits
---
There's a couple of perks that make Scorchbeasts trivial. Concentrated Fire 1 allows you to VATS Target the wings which, when crippled, forces them to land. Cripple their legs once they're on the ground and they go dormant for a while. Enforcer for shotguns, Modern Renegade for pistols, Tormentor for Rifles, and One Gun Army for heavies all give chance to cripple a limb. 
---
I fought FOUR Scorchbeasts solo without too much trouble using just 4 points invested in the above perks. Give it a try!
---
Yup, I've seen a few people comment on how the X01/T60/T51 are better but I'm not going to give up +160 carry capacity (with room for another calibrated shock) and only having to repair two pieces in 40 levels of play with my level 45 set. 
---
I really wish there was a jetpack for it though.
---
I'm working on a giant pipe cannon so will work on it
---
I thought billy was considered noncanon?
---
Try the carnivore mutation. Double benefit from eating meat and you do not have to cook it. 
---
There are so many random animals to get meat off that soon you won't have to worry about good. Irradiated meat from nuke zones also do not spoil so grab them.
---
Water is my problem...I use Boiled as I don't have purifers yet. I drink about 6 for full thirst bar and it goes down pretty fast but boil water is free as you only need a water source and wood. 
---
I go out boil 50 and that should do me several hours.
---
I've been given probably 10-12 TSE's. 10mm machine pistols is fun on lower to med-level enemies
---
I don't have the perk cards or plans yet for that
---
I just hit level 25 on my 9th day (maybe 30-35 hours), exploring and questing like it's a single-player game. I especially like finding things I haven't spoiled by reading online yet.
---
I haven't been specifically grinding/farming anything yet, though I've got a bunch of power armor chassis' wasting space in my stash with pieces that are above my level (and until we can tell them apart it's too big of a mess to deal with), and I did plan my perks before launch to figure out my SPECIAL targets, after hearing that respeccing would be hard.
---
I also compulsively pick up almost every bit of junk I walk past, so I'm usually overencumbered and I spend a lot of time trying to bulk and sell it, or I'll just throw a large chunk of my stash away because it's too hard to sell.
---
Yes it does, explosive damage is equal to 16 damage per projectile (so 6x16 on a shotgun). To make it even better, whatever perks improve your regular weapon damage also apply to that base 16. This is especially noticeable on very high rof low damage weapons like minigun. With full perks on a normal mini you might get upwards of 25-30 damage a shot where just adding explosive pits your max potential at around be 100 a shot.
---
Sounds great, thanks for the advice!
---
My legendary modded gatling plasma broke before exhausting a single core.  I just ended up dropping it and 15 plasma cores on the ground, fucking useless, and weighs to much to wait for them to patch it.
---
“I used to be a vault dweller like you, until I took a duped TSE shotgun blast in the knee...”
---
I had that surprise happen to me too, except it was a full set of the Raider power armor.  Man, I wish it was the ultracite, lucky.
---
We need an emote that looks like WW2 soldiers crouching in a trench with a radio.  You kknow, like calling out for help.  Maybe this is a cooler way to signal that you would like to chat.
---
I do lol. Even since the nerfs to fusion cores I've still been sitting on 50 of them for weeks. Minus not having g a jetpack it's the perfect armor for exploring.
---
What does animated mean? 
---
Yeah, like 1 fps. It's weird, as I have a fairly decent computer with a gtx 1060, so I probably shouldn't have this issue. it also happens whenever I fast travel somewhere, but only for a few seconds.
---
&gt;(1) Secretary Thomas Eckhart, per an Enclave Whitespring Bunker Archival Terminal Entry, is told that we are in a VSS Simulation (Post-Chinese Nuclear War), and that we can only escape by destroying the location that is the conduit to the outside (a small town in China).
---
As an aside, I always found it curious that VATS refers to "liberators" as such. Seems like "oppressor" would be a more apt designation. If the system recognizes Chinese machines as liberators, it seems like the simulation could be developed by the Chinese - perhaps a wargames-style simulation to prepare for the war.
---
I've had two encounters with mics 1) pleasant greetings and acknowledgements during events 2) listen to some girl refer to some guy as "her hero" and then proceed to announce everything she did as she did it from their base outside the Golf Club. Shit got weird when she got musical about it.
---
Here's to you, random announcing female player. You weirded me out and that's ok as long as you had fun.
---
It's random, but you can get others.
---
Actually I take back my last statement - apparently I remembered now that part of the problem was with the Xbox itself.  I used to have 2 Xboxes in my network and sometimes things would get VERY wonky if both were on trying to play online games.
---
There is apparently (was?) a bug in XBox where it won't re-request uPnP ports when it comes out of sleep mode and apparently doing a reboot of the Xbox or checking multiplayer connection will fix things. 
---
 Not sure how applicable that is - but couldn't hurt to try to do a reboot when things go weird and see if that clears it up.  
---
Of course when you setup a different network connection - that too will reach out to the router and set back up the UPnP for the new IP that it requests on the wireless connection.  However i'm going to guess that after a few "sleep modes" with the Xbox, you may still see the problem arise.  Perhaps the old attage of turning it off and on again helps because it does reach out to setup the UPnP again when it does.
---
last night i had 3 or 4 in 15 minutes when I first started. That was more than I've had total since the game came out. 
---
Look buddy I use two shot handmade to tag enemies too. But you coming on reddit and screaming how people should play the game as if you have the right to tag enemies is also idiotic. If people let you tag, its them being nice if they dont you can ask nicely but dont demand like you are entitled to it. Also calling people dupers and they should play rust...yea......if I see you ingame ill tse the shit out of you. There are numerous threads from people asking nicely without being a dick. Search and learn.
---
Some side notes: Everytime I do nuke zone I see low levels. I dont mind having them tag mobs. I use a low dmg two shot for this purpose. But often the low levels cant kill them fast enough and soon im surrounded by 4 of the glowing zombies. Then I have to switch between weapons to tag and then kill them. I dont do low level event so cant comment on those.
---
Two shot, exploding?
---
Do you have any numbers handy on that? When I did some quick timing in the Beta they seemed to stack as I expected and I've kept both equiped since, currently augmented by several pieces of AP legendary armor.  Couldn't find anything substantive in a search just now, but I will go back later and test it again.  Thanks for the heads up, in any event.
---
Oh, it shows blacked out on mine. Is it the spoiler in our convo or earlier? Thanks for pointing it out btw, I try to be as careful as I can. 
---
I did for a bit.  You might try completely signing out of the launcher, then quitting out of it.  I ended up using the Task Manager to kill it, since Close just minimizes it, but I may have just missed the exit option somewhere.  For me at least, when I restarted the launcher, it asked for one last login then started the game logged in as usual.
---
Probably because I can never go an hour without disconnecting so I'll never be able to play for a long enough in-game time to change the date
---
They were friendly?
---
Oops. 
---
oh thank you so I just need to keep spamming and hope for it?
---
It works exactly this way. M79 used to work that way too but they took away its shotgun classification. Explosive weapons may get nerfed similarly in the future. Dunno yet but the M79 wasn't meant to be a shotgun, explosive weapons are meant to be a shotgun, ha.
---
What's stranger, is there were literally only about 5-10 people visible on map.
---
Thank you. 
---
First they need to totally re-balance PVP and bases.  Then I'm totally down for PVP servers.
---
Right now PVP is so broken.  With my melee character I can 1 shot anyone.  With my ranged character I can one shot anyone.  PVP should take skill, not BOOM DEAD.
---
Bases are laughably easy to destroy.  Turrets are ineffective.  Walls are a joke.  With the way the building is setup you can't even make a close to defensible base.
---
After those 2 things are done, I'm totally down for full PVP servers.
---
p.s.  Player's level, cards, and special MUST transfer to the new server.  I'm not 100% redoing characters every time they come out with a new "flavor" of server.  I don't care if inventory transfers, I can manage to get new stuff just fine.
---
They wouldn't wipe everyone's inventory. If they have the capability, they would wipe only the inventories of people who have themselves duplicated items. They probably wouldn't delete all duplicated items. The inflation of OP weapons will be fixed with weapon rebalances and power creep
---
It's also important to remember, that if somone is in a group and you arn't, they can hear you but you can't hear them, unless they go into the menu then to settings and set chat to area, cutting off comms with their own group as a result. Its sorta a hassle. 
---
Yeah - as game consoles age - so does their capacity to keep up with what might now be newer versions of the console that have slightly better specs or performance capabilities.  We've seen this with past consoles that when the "thin" or newer ones come out they have slightly better video capabilities to not only support whatever they're now adding (like PS Pro supporting 4k) but that ultimately does mean a step up on something being better on the console to support that. 
---
I had a guy in beta asking people near the vault about what takeaway to order. Odd man.
---
250 hours? Man, I burned out hard at around 130.  This game is painfully shallow once you finish the questline + do a small handful of nukes and get a few decent weapons.  There is just no grind, nothing to promote longevity.
---
I had 24th of October once, but it's been 23rd ever since.
---
Nice one be on soon 
---
Super Duper is a must for all crafting. 
---
Want to turn two stimpacks into potentially 8 diluted stimpacks? 
---
Crafting food and drinks for yourself, friends and to sell? Super duper is amazing for it too. 
---
Crafting adhesive from vegetable starch? Double it with Super Duper. 
---
Crafting handmades and miniguns to scrap for mods? Must have Super Duper to minimise the amount of wasted mats. 
---
Crafting late game mats like flux? 
---
Crafting rare power armour pieces? 
---
Super Duper is one of the best perks in the game. 
---
Makes the grind so much easier. 
---
I wish we could craft nuka colas, as Super Duper would give us the chance to double our caps. 
---
There’s only one and I’m fairly certain you can learn it from scrapping too
---
There's a couple of perks that make Scorchbeasts trivial. Concentrated Fire 1 allows you to VATS Target the wings which, when crippled, forces them to land. Cripple their legs once they're on the ground and they go dormant for a while. Enforcer for shotguns, Modern Renegade for pistols, Tormentor for Rifles, and One Gun Army for heavies all give chance to cripple a limb.
---
Yup, that.
---
It's because weapon condition is based on hits. Not shots fired. Shotguns work fine with it because they have a very high durability. But you'll notice that two shot weapons break faster, and putting a beam splitter on a regular laser rifle makes it break INCREDIBLY fast. And you don't get any bonus damage for the splitter so there is no point to put it on. 
---
It also fucks with explosive weapons (but not the explosive legendary effect from what I've seen) because hitting a crowd of 4-5 enemies with a missile launcher or auto grenade launcher makes it break in about 20 hits 
---
I'm playing on PS4. I have not once, in over 200 hours of gameplay, played with anyone else: I'm a dedicated Lone Wanderer. I'm having a blast despite all the negativity surrounding the game. 
---
As a Lone Wanderer in FO76, know these caveats:
---
\-There is no pause feature or save game feature; if you stand idly too long, you're logged off; and if you need to leave the game, you just quit the server. When you log on again you'll spawn where you logged off.
---
\-There is no way, other than starting over with a completely new character, to replay scenarios--you only get one chance. This means that the only way to deploy lessons learned is in the next encounter, rather than being able to load a previous save and replay the event.
---
\-Because of the above, if you accidentally scrap an item there is no way to go back and retrieve it; you'll have to log in on a different server and hope the item spawns again; if you built it yourself, then you'll have to build it again. This last one is mostly tedious because of the junk required to craft items, especially often hard-to-find junk items like adhesive, screws, and ballistic fibre (or anti-ballistic fibre)
---
\-Blocking other players is the most effective way of maintaining the solo experience, but you'll have to block each player on your server individually, and you'll have to periodically check the Social tab and block new arrivals. I've noticed that most of the trolls I encountered back in November have since matured or departed, so blocking isn't strictly necessary; muting, however, is vital--you don't want your solo experience befouled by crying babies and nagging housemates and noisy eating.
---
\-Selecting Pacifist Mode in the game settings, after you've logged on, is the best way to avoid accidentally getting in fights with other players
---
\-Even if you block all other players, and you play in PM, you can still utilize other players' C.A.M.P.s without penalty; their Stash Box displays as yours. In my experience, most players don't mind you using their workshops and beds; I always leave a paper bag of thank-you items.
---
A quick note about the angst regarding FO76: from my perspective, the only snaggly difference between the experience of FO76 and FO3/4 is the inability to save and pause my game, and this was more frustrating when I first started playing, but I've grown accustomed to it---it's really just a matter of slightly adjusting how you go about the game, and it's ultimately still better done than games with no save and few checkpoints. If you die in FO76, you simply respawn near your point of death, pick up your dropped items (and you only drop your junk items, not armour, weapons, or aid), and continue playing as normal. When you log out or quit the game, you log back in near the spot you left and continue playing. 
---
In 200 hours, I've only run across a couple server crashes, and a couple freezes that require a restart. 
---
As to other players, they rarely bother you, can easily be blocked or muted, and the map is so big that I honestly only rarely see other players despite knowing from the Social tab that there are thirty or more on my server. 
---
As to weird graphics glitches and gameplay glitches (like enemies receiving no damage, or spawning from nowhere, or immediately respawning), I've noticed nothing more egregious than what we've seen in all the previous games. As to the graphics quality, overall it's not much better than FO4, but it's good enough: I think the environments are often quite breathtakingly beautiful. 
---
As to the lack of NPCs with which to interact, go into this game understanding that all other humans (other than the Vault Dwellers from 76) in the area are dead; take the time to read the notes they left behind, listen to the logs they recorded, and you have a spectacular re-imagining of the entire NPC experience, a coherent and engaging storyline, and as many other players have noted, ~~some of~~ the most heart-rending voice acting ~~I've~~ ever seen in any game.
---
As to the Atomic Shop, yes the microtransaction prices are outrageous, but they are all cosmetic--no one is "paying to play" in terms of outperforming other players because they can afford to spend $15 on an outfit. The items in the Atomic Shop are personal choice purchases that have no real effect in the game. Also, playing the game generates Atoms that can be used in the Atomic Shop, so there's no need to spend real money to buy a new hair-do for your character. 
---
All that said, I think the bulk of problems people have with the game stem from the multiplayer aspects of it, and you're unlikely to find the same faults if you're playing solo.
---
Happy Adventuring!
---
There is a cave across the river from Harpers Ferry. It is behind the rocks/hill and has several ore spawns and a mine cart inside.
---
I'm sure it'll make it in eventually
---
Agreed. I have the outfit, and hate the leather cap inside. 
---
 I'd just recommend getting the crippling perks for your preferred ranged weapon so you can get her on the ground quickly and smash away. The shotgun cripple perk has the best chance to proc. :)
---
Clearly, the way to undo this is to place the cat back on the keyboard, but upside down. 
---
Actually... I'd rather have Elder Scrolls 76 than Fallout 76. Seems like it'd make more sense.
---
Lvl 70 or so, definitely gonna need some friends on here with the Player Vendor going live soon. 
---
DingBingus is the name SwingDingus is the game.
---
(I'm a melee build. Dingus is my vampire super sledge lololol)
---
Oh! I thought all I needed to was stand there to initiate a crash. That's what's been happening to me. Just crashes. Xbox here as well. 
---
The Pied Piper, yeah I had a good laugh when I saw that.
---
Tyvm
---
Nope, seen same thing today also. Turrets killing all the high level ghouls to the point that only level 1 eye bots started spawning. On went wrecking ball and me and my team mate lit the place up, they very quickly switched server. Still gimped ours for everyone.
---
Am I the only one who hated this quest? I just wanted it to end so bad but it kept on dragging.
---
I'm level 120.  I save them for whenever I want to try new things or do more min/maxing.  I don't plan on totally redoing my build.  I had a friend that kept switching his build, first normal, then junkies, then 20% health build.  That's just wasting points for no reason.  If Bethesda ever does some serious re-balance to the game you will NEED those points to adjust your build.
---
I used to insta disconnect when I got 3 scorchbeasts but I found they sometimes drop very good plans if you're doing a defense task
---
It’s more fun if you set yourself a goal and be social. You can put around solo but it’s more fun in groups.
---
I found the crashed sat at the southwest bottom of the map, just a short distance away from the fence marking the end of the playable area, on the shore of a pond, it is lootable.
---
i leave it open mic and just mute/unmute my headset. 
---
Why not just sit outside the entrance of how you came in and shoot it from a distance.  EIther that or if your PA is strong enough (Excavator Lvl 45 for me) - just go on in with a 100+ Melee weapon and hit the shit out of it.  Takes about 2 mins and I only had to use 1 Stimpack - and it was dead.  The harder part was getting to the Cave Crickets wayyyyy up there on that one post to get their treasures :)
---
Resistance wise no, but crafting items with high intelligence and the right perks will make them more durable than the ones found in the world. 
---
I'll be on about 4:30 central time today. Lvl 49.  Superkill64. 🤔 maybe 48. I can't remember if I leveled last night. lol
---
YES! The pied piper. Haven't seen it since the BETA
---
Dupes can be second, all they would really need to do is go through and look for all the duped things. No point in fixing something when you cant stay connected to the server long enough to be affected
---
I really want the radiation suit to be an outfit with the radiation resistance, that way I don't have to keep using power armors.
---
Everybody poops
---
How does the simulation predict the BoS, Super Mutants, Ghouls and all that other post-war stuff then?
---
i would consider this more if vault 76 isnt described in previous fallouts as a control vault set to reopen after 20 years
---
the unplug me is clearly a play on the "kick me" prank
---
Conduits work fine.  The power lights you need an "emitter".  The normal power connectors act as emitters.  With conduits you need to either attach the conduit to a normal power connector or use the conduit piece named "emitter" to power lights in it's vicinity.
---
It sounds like maybe you might not have connected your main generator to the conduit.  There's two sections for conduits, one section as all the conduit pieces that have connectors built in, the second is just extensions.  Use one of the pieces with the connector, and wire the generator to the conduit.
---
Normally I'd drop such things, but since I have bear arms maxed out it's really no trouble to carry around at 3lbs, it's just really unfortunate that they're waiting to fix it this long 
---
I can confirm the no repair to double durability.
---
I hope they fix that.  I double repair all my weapons for the extra damage and durability :(
---
I Never have that problem but some other people were talking about it and saying he switched to wifi from ethernet and it fixed it
---
The closest thing I can think of as to why they focused on the Atom shop, is they went over-budget during the development and needed the money from the pre-orders to cover most, if not, all of the costs, and are now relying on the atom store to further fund the development. 
---
Other than that I can't really think of anything else. Other than Greed that is
---
Friends had to restart. One never came back lol
---
My boyfriend and I both have our own TV/XBOX in our living room. I'm hard wired and he's wifi. I frequently get more disconnects. His game will also load faster than mine, even if I'm the first person to fast travel somewhere and he clicks to fast travel to me, he will always load first. I'm gonna try wifi.
---
I think the last one was just before Christmas
---
Well to not spoil the event, I killed way more than I needed to because I was so busy killing waves of enemies that I did not notice a quest step update that required me to do something. Once I took care of that quest step it became more manageable. I went in at level 59 and I exited the silo at level 64. Now that I have done it once the second time will be way easier since I know what to do. Not being a melee build that sword really saved my skin, in the end it broke as well with only a few nearly dead robots left to kill. I just wanted people to know that it was possible without being all legendary geared up. I am sure in a group and with better gear it will go faster. Best advice I can give is pay attention to the quest steps when they update and the quest will be a manageable and exciting dungeon crawl Fallout style. Most fun I have had in game so far. I am looking forward to doing it again soon. Eventually I will get around to the Queen but that will definitely take some friends. Good luck when you get around to doing it.
---
I concur. No reason to collect armor until you’re able to wear it. 
---
I went from No PA to building Excavator to building X-01. I’ve acquired Ultracite and collected a T-60 set just for fun afterwards. 
---
But to each their own, it’s still good info in OP. 
---
Do you know if the normal armor special effects still apply if you are in power armor?  Or should you dump of your normal armor in the stash box so you can carry more? I have one piece that is unyielding and one that has a 50% chance to revive.  But I was preparing to go into the blast zone and thought about the two arms that reduce ghoul damage and then wasn't sure if they work under PA??? 
---
FOV slider would be my guess. When I finally got to adjust it after the update, the first thing I noticed is that I can no longer read terminals from the couch. (they need to differentiate the normal FOV and the terminal FOV)
---
Because we are new, PA is iconic fallout, and we don’t know any better? 
---
I have three frames with some armor and they are all wasting stash space. OPs trick is going to save me and a lot of other wastelanders a lot of stash space. 
---
I did this too. Had two power armor chassis on me but I only wanted one cause it had the excavator pa.  Ended up having a second set so I sold it to a vendor in the white springs resort 
---
I have an explosive shotgun that is a 3 star legendary but not 2shot. Im not a duper either...???
---
That is tuff. Idk if I’m ever coming back after this if I can’t figure it out 
---
You are welcome. Good luck with finding them.
---
Yeah, I should get rid of some, lol.
---
/u/lonevaultwanderer are BGS aware of how a complicated CAMP setup crashes the game? 
---
I spent over five hours building a nice lakeside manor with a garage and some level 32 griefer that was one shotting level 140s destroyed my house completely, racking up a ~900 cap bounty.  Even took out my decon arch setting me back cobalt flux that I could barely get one of.
---
The thing is:
---
1. If I try to “repair all structures”, the game CTDs and I can’t repair it that way at all.
---
2. If try to move my camp and place my house back down again, it disconnects me from the game (I know this as I’ve done this with less complicated CAMPs in the past).
---
So not only did that griefer destroy my house and get off scot-free (as the game crashed when I tried to fix my house first and therefore couldn’t try to recover caps to buy materials), I’m getting punished over and over again for having my house destroyed because the game crashes or boots me for trying to repair with the mats that I do have.
---
If I had wanted to explain what he had said in a different manner like everyone else, I would have. I placed his bad verbiage in a different context to make it more apparent. I even said explicitly that it was bad verbiage. You can assume everyone on the internet needs you to correct them, and I'd imagine their response feel a lot like getting attention. I could waste even more of my precious time informing you that you're not helping, just virtue signaling. But not today Satan. Not today.
---
Given you're not taking advantage of any sort of "glitch" that those who are over-encumbered typically are, I am gonna guess you're mucking with the database side of things not liking your capacity here.  If you truly legit bought maps and stocked up like you said, reach out to Bethesda.  They may be able to look at your guy and figure out how to get you working again, but the alternative side of things being that you blew out the capacity for a single user DB wise is very plausible and you don't have much recourse as its possible you corrupted your "dataset" for what they had on you.
---
Either way I'd open something with support and see what can happen - you don't have much of a choice right now anyways.
---
I'd do that too, then just have my friend claim my bounty.
---
That person is essentially griefing the spawns there.  Make sure they pay for it in destroyed base repairs :)
---
That can have another crappy affect.  I want to empty out my stash and sell my legendaries.  If the vending machine is part of my stash limit it prevents me from emptying out my stash.
---
So maybe a 76lbs stash limit is added and you can't pull items out of it.  
---
A compromise of some sort. 
---
If you exit the game in PA with a core that is empty when you log back in that core is recharged ;)
---
Because it's made up.  Someone trying to find cracks or inconsistencies or...pretty much anything in a sprawling narrative created by humans is going to be able to read whatever they want into it.
---
None of this proves anything.  It's also a very common and trite concept that philosophers have posed for thousands of years.  It's more likely that OP just wanted to make this idea fit and found a few connections to it.
---
Level 62 here, finally got around to the very first BoS main quest like a week ago. I always think, “I’ll get to that main quest but first I gotta go sell some stuff, move my camp, see if I can lock down some good mutations, go explore this location I haven’t seen yet, move my camp there, sell some stuff, hunt down some food, scrounge up some more 5.56 ammo, tear down and rebuild my camp, etc etc etc”
---
There is a couple spots they spawn.
---
This was my thought as well, but unfortunately no map markers or quest has popped yet. Even tried equipping it to see if this made a difference, still no luck. I am almost certain I have every location discovered, and I even tried Googling any leads, but no luck either. Unfortunately as "amazing" as this Leather Left Leg is, I will not be galavanting around Appalachia showing it off, so hopefully I just happen to stumble upon the location. Until then, I will have to sacrifice the weight of the Mythical Leather Left Leg from Wendigo cave in my inventory. 
---
I just carry mine around tbh. I still get the effect just for having it in my inventory and I still get to wear my civil war dress instead
---
This theory honestly makes me enjoy the game more.
---
I am totally with you on the whole "oblivious bounding into danger" thing. LOL 
---
"Gosh, self, what's that noise?"
---
"Why, I don't know, self. Let's go find out!"
---
&lt;bound bound bound&gt; To the East
---
"AAAAARRRGGGGHHH!" ..... Incoherent scream....
---
&lt;bound bound bound&gt; Back to the West again as fast as little footies can go.
---
So?
---
Just because it's possible doesn't mean it's true, or even remotely likely.
---
It is in fact a wonderful piece of information for saving stash space. Not only for new players but veterans alike. If you want multiple suits of armor with different upgrades, paint, looks, this will save a bunch of stash space. 
---
6 personal journals, 18 logs, if memory serves.  Just went through the other day to collect the ones I didn't have and listen to them all.
---
this is due only to my love of fallout and having some cool freinds 
---
Theres a youtube video that does that
---
It’s self sorting, in my experience. I still wander about with my mic on doing the clickity clack and reverb thing, and people who hate that shit mute me and those that don’t, don’t. Suits.
---
Agreed especially early on in the game you really don’t have a way to correct anything. Most traditional mmos are a lot more forgiving allowing you to respec.. I hope they put a mechanism in for that because restarting to do something different is a little rough. Me, I like having multiples but I also would like to fix it when I make a mistake ☺️ 
---
I'm sure there here reading all of the posts and then figuring out what to do.
---
We've already seen evidence of that.  Look at the past patch notes.  You'll notice they correspond pretty close to what people are currently complaining about in the reddit.
---
So far I've been pretty happy with their progress.  I wish it was faster, but hey I don't run the company....lol
---
It's because it does. Weapon condition is based on hits and not shots fired. 
---
Two shot and barrel splitters kill durability because unlike shotguns, those weapons aren't normally shorting multiple projectiles at once. Which I believe is an oversight on the weapon condition mechanic as a whole
---
I love taking the cores out (have 29 now) out of armor that just spawns randomly in places.  However my favorite was a one time spawn of X01 armor out east and I was maybe a level 15 at the time.  I didn't have the room to take anything but the core, but I knew more opportunities would come as it was a level 40 that would take forever for me to ever get into.
---
Trap an enemy in the room next door lol 
---
The marine tactical helmet?
---
There are differing build, but a general consensus is swing speed. You can make anything 
---
If it bloodied swing speed, instigating, vampire, swing speed is nice. 
---
Now there are a few variations, but you can make any build work and it depends on what you’re doing. 
---
For example, farming white spring ? Instigating or vamp + swing speed. Would be nice 
---
For the queen. Swing speed + bloodied/ executioner can work or you can with a power attack one. 
---
Not sure if I was trolled using this a month or so ago. Two guys went by with one saying "WHERE are you going to send the nuke?!" ... no nuke was launched.
---
If other people needed a cult to believe in, and if other people happened to be the kind of people who would join a cult if it provided companionship and a sense of purpose and all the right ideas, and if there was no one who would step up to lead such a cult, for the well being of our family and friends-- and for our future and our species-- then Persaevus would do the right thing and step up and lead such a cult toward some semblance of a rational world view which would actually provide everything we wanted from life and set the best example for future generations. He's unafraid of hard work and shared burdens. If someone had to do it, well, alright. He'd be a cult leader. Because, when you should be idolized by others, and especially when you have the deep, sad eyes-- you just feel like your talents are being wasted killing supermutants. Not that Persaevus would actually want any responsibilities.  
---
He's the spiritual tiller that every stable server community needs. And he is just checking in, to see what condition, your condition is in. If you're unsure about something, well why don't you check in with Persaevus, and see what he thinks. He's usually got good words for cheap, and I hear he makes a lot of sense. And he's got that old wisdom, you can see it in his eyes. Kinda sad, but also kinda happy, kinda warm. Remember-- this mind is the bubba, and that mind over there is also the bubba. And the bubba is the new buddha. And also the old buddha. And also, an empty cup's not broken if it doesn't have a hole. (that's copyright and trademark, him. By the way. He's got a book coming out, but it's always just coming out.)  
---
He needs a stable private server, or a very large "family" of regular players who have all agreed where all their camps are going to be (and who prefers what workshops), so there is server synergy and server community whenever he is on. He is all about the small stable township, and all humans generally being "on the same side" despite the occasional crazy, so his time is not yet. So far, there's just crazies and innocents running around everywhere. The need for someone to create a community should be obvious. It is pretty obvious to Persaevus.
---
maybe we will be able to craft some Nuka Cola in a future update. :-)  at least we can dream?
---
I've seen a few, but have thankfully never been caught up in their explosion.
---
Hi! This wasn't a nuke event. Some players build their base behind the golf spring resort. The resort is currently the best / only place to reliably farm legendaries. However, when they have a turret pointing in every window of the resort, it kind of takes it away from everyone else.
---
Not my best photo, but i decided to get a picture of the SBQ we'd just dropped, when this dude rocked up wanting revenge. Seconds after i clicked, bam! Axe to the head &gt;&lt;
---

---
I kinda agree, although one shot kills dont bother me so much if its like that all around. with this engine and scripting I cant see skill ever playing into engagements much. I mean the game IS an aimbot lol. That being said, the element of suprise, being cautious and tactical, these things could play a big part. 
---
What lvl enemies are you fighting? Myself, I like to explore and have probably done 4-5 main missions and lots of events and side quests and find myself fighting lvl 10 up to level 40.
---
I've spent hours looking and never found calibrated shocks for anything. A friend finally found me a set for x01, and a different friend found me a single excavator. RNGsus is not merciful.
---
My wife picked those emotes up thinking that they'd be special (before I could warn her).  She was.. not happy.
---
I seen a lot of these, if you cute the correct wire you can get some Junk, if its the wrong wire you get blown up.
---
I dunno if this is what Bethesda intended...but I hope they go with it.  Or not.  I just like my fish lamp.
---
Hahaha thanks man
---
Old news was discovered weeks ago. But it does work. 
---
[Scenes from the Enclave Bunker] (/spoiler)
---
Do you use your mic? If you can talk to them they will probably stick around and take what you want to unload. 
---
I dont think hotfix are real updates
---
The offer to trade thing?  Like using emotes gives you away or do you mean something else?
---
I guess were writing full blown theories now to excuse shiity dev practices. Games on their death bed go through this cycle. Dead on arrival, 76.
---
this great game
---
You can never be to old for a good meme
---
I sadly don't. Bethesda was like 1 member of staff who uses this subreddit every so often, like 'lone wonder' I think he's called.
---
I believe they may have a some means of asking for things but I haven't a clue where it was linked.
---
I'm down to try help get this to Bethesda tho 
---
The chem bench that looks like a makeshift brewing contraption should be able to make booze.
---
Level 15-45 is a pretty weak area in the game.  You don't have enough legendary stuff to make you OP, and you're constantly out of things you need.
---
Do whitesprings nuke zones.  Bring a crap 10mm or .38 pistol and hit every ghoul ONE time.  You still get full XP and loot from them.  Don't try to tank them, just run around and 1 hit everything, let the higher levels kill them.  You'll get massive XP and get plenty of legendary weapons.  Then you can start building your legendary loadout.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Can't find the exact source, but one of the YouTubers spreading them had his main account banned and closed his Discord where he talked about duping. 
---
It points outwards, away from the wall so it's easier to pull with your opposing arm and hold in place with the adjacent arm.
---
how long would you be sitting in that bush waiting? this aint PUBG or Fortnite, there is no boundry pushing us together to force engagements. would you sit there for days? No food, no water.... nope. you would have to go out and scavange. And in doing so, you would be exposed. Maybe a level 10 one shots you with a f-ing hunting rifle, and then you lose your shit...

So I’ve got about 70 hours on PC and haven’t crashed or had my game freeze a single time. Is this not normal?
---
And the shriek too right the blahhhhhhhh they do?
---
Haha cool! I had it happen to me and yeah I couldn’t wire anything new that wasn’t already blueprinted at that time. I ended up with the most massive perimeter wall that lined the complete circumference of my camp 
---
Why dose the fat man make her immortal? Dose a enclave orbital strike do the same?
---
My wife and I have been crashing constantly over the past several days.  It seems to be getting worse and worse.
---
I might have encountered one. I heard the beeping, then a big explosion at a distance, but I didn't see him directly. 
---
Ooof they actually replied. That's awesome ^^
---
Well, if you've been cooped up with the same 30 people for 25 years straight, you might want a break from them too. And they expected to emerge into something relatively peaceful, maybe a few mutations. Not FEV-horrors around every corner, a raging zombie symbiote virus controlling/killing everyone, and a raider boss having blown up a dam and destroyed Charleston with a flood.
---
While the fact that no one seems to have any inclination to use the giant high tech defensive bunker they own as a base are a bit of gaps, the Overseer part is actually explained.
---
(some spoilers)
---
The Overseer ran off ahead on her own, to try and find her husband Evan. She'd found out about how most of the Vaults were crazy experiments and got caught in the process, and Vault-Tek made her leave him out of the Vault to prove her loyalty, which she went along with, but later regrets. So she stumbles onto everything a day earlier then you, and eventually finds Evan at Mount Blair but he's a Scorched (you have to go in the basement she locked him in and kill him because she couldn't). Then settles on to the plan to nuke the Scorched.
---
Bruh you need to use the snipping tool
---
Thanks man. I will definitely do this when I get home from work and a really do hope they can do something about this. 
---
Also I don’t think my dataset is corrupted because when i grab something out of my stash like that I had in my inventory when I crashed, I get the item out of my stash and the items I had in my inventory. 
---
For example I grab one piece of ammo out of my stash I end up with 400+ in my inventory(the one from the stash plus however much I had when I crashed)
---
I hope this means my dataset is not yet corrupt

I'm pretty sure one of the dev's said that they had a few people reading reddit and forums and the like.

I do remember that the first thing that EVERYONE wanted was the Stash increase, which was reasonable. The first update didn't have it, but in the patch notes they gave a reason as to why not and then included it in the next update.

Oh yeah, haven't had the pleasure of them blowing me up though. Been wondering how much damage they actually do.

Let's be honest, you know there's no $80 sold anywhere that comes in a plastic bottle. Maybe you don't drink alcohol, which is fine, but usually the worst and cheapest stuff comes in plastic.

Any adult that buys alcohol would never have the expectations that their $80 alcohol would come in a plastic bottle.

Also I have had a couple different new players stop at my base or my friends base and just hang out for like 15 minutes talking it up. Usually just toss them some helpful items, explain some mechanics and part ways.
---
What REALLY needs to happen is 2 push to talk buttons. One for area and one for team. I play a lot of the time with some dudes from work and when randoms come up it always starts with "Yo you guys got mics...can you guys hear me...hello?" as we dick around in the menu to set chat to area which is a pain in the ass. Also if you want to privately say something to your team and not have the whole of Apple-atcha hear it, BOOM another fun time of dicking around with the chat setting. 2 PTT keys would alleviate this...if only we had some kind of board...filled with a ball load of keys we could bind to do things.

Top of the world there is alot of tin can chimes ro disarm as well as other items. You just pick them up log out an back in an repeat. I was at 0 an had 300 with about 4 relogs.
---
how? for research purposes 
---
There's a bunch. There's one on the highway just south of the Mothman museum. One just south of the Veiled Sundew Grove, a little bit past the monorail line. One on the road south of Harper's Ferry, just before a little overpass bridge. One of them just north of the Overseer's camp, in the grass to the east of the road. Those are the main ones I know of, anyway.

too bad you can trigger the door on the potty to close when they go in it.

omg yes!

Did you ever get any others?  I didnt get the extra blade mod until level 40, and you need makeshift warrior 4 to craft it.
---
My penis.
---
was this on xbox? my SO set up his camp on the golf course last night near one of the greens because we were so over-encumbered and needed a place to scrap our junk. i wouldn't say he has a lot of turrets but the only enemies spawning around the camp were low level super mutants. he has also recently figured out how to lock the door of his camp but has yet to figure out how to take it down without scrapping it (is that a thing he can do? he didn't actually want the locked door). around an hour later after we went on a quest, a nuke was incoming at whitespring and blew up his camp. he tried to get the achievement for being at ground zero of a nuclear blast while in his camp but it didn't work.
---
I saw a behemoth super mutant at a whitesprings nuke. 
---
Interesting. If they were near other mounds people would have seen them by now i imagine.

*"We’re also building an incredible list of future updates that we can’t wait to share, including new quests, weekly in-game events, new Vaults opening, a new PvP mode,* ***Player Vending*** *and much more."*
---
Those who would leave the game they are likely just waiting for an excuse to throw in the towel, for the long term players how do we know our future investments/grinds mean anything. Let's not even delve into the server stability of these characters floating about. 
---
 If this was like fo4, mod/exploit it all you wan't, but it's an open world game that we should be on the same playing field.
---
LMAO Almond Joy commercial ahahaha. I dunno I spawn in the exact spot everytime.

Picked up RDR2 just to hold me over until that point haha
---
Finally got it to go again. Took 15 or 20 logins before it finally kicked in. Yeah, I went back to the first beacon and tried to force it to start from there, but as I said, the transmitter was only showing "Replay last recording".
---
All in vain because I had to give up after getting almost all the way through the quest (I think - just getting pretty deep into the [glassed cavern, past a dead scorched mirelurk queen](/spoiler)), because I ran out of fusion cores for my PA and stimpaks for myself. Grrr. Have to grind some more to get ready to do it again.
---
Also: To the turd who downvoted my original comment and the reply above this: What's *your* problem? I was reporting what I perceived to be an "issue", in the **Issues and Feedback Thread**. FYVM.
---
&gt;I'd at the very least dump tons of stuff I can't sell to vendors due to the 200 cap limit at a default price.
---
That depends on specific implementation of the whole system don't you think?
---
I think a lot of people would expect the vending machines to have their own inventory space. I certainly hope they don't. Because if they do, it won't be large. I want to deside myself how much of my total stash amount I would allocate to the vending machine(s). For example I would like to place a bunch of medicore weapons I might have picked up, for very modest prices, as "floating stock", that may or may not sell. And if it doesn't sell, I will dump it and replace it gradually with something better I may find. Stuff that currently I just mainly have to drop off the moment I check my inventory to see what kind of effects they have. I could do maybe 50-100 lbs from the current 600 limit. That would leave more than plenty of room to try to sell some drugs and some resources as well, as they aren't really that heavy. Maybe occasional pile of heavy ammo like missiles ect.
---
But if they have separate limit, it's very likely the limit would be rather low. A lot of guns are fairly heavy, so you might end up being able to like 50 lbs. That's only enough for two melee and maybe one gun. Worse if you find a semi-decent heavy gun you might want to try to sell.
---
Another thing I fear is people will list useless crap on them, that mostly no one would be intrested in buying. Or some useful things for 3x as much as what's reasonable price. If I check the first 10 vending machines and they are set up like that, there's not good chances for there to be 11th of vending machine I bother to check. I hope people are smart enough about them, and that the rest learn quickly, or they won't be useful at all.
---
&gt;With any luck they'll default it to whatever a vendor would have paid
---
With any luck?? If you can't set your own prices, those things are not going to be of any use. Decent 3 star or good 2 star legendaries would be valued for like 200 caps, which is far too little. Drugs would be too expensive. Ammo, oh boy. No one would buy any ammo for the stock prices. You absolutely need to be able to set your own price, and well, are they smart enough to understand you need to be able to set prices below 1 cap per piece.
---
 my heart broke, I thought it was the new notes

Could you link a map screenshot?

wear anything else with cloaking armor and you get a stealth field when crouching.

I was wondering that too and found this https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uh07s/animated_perk_cards/

Difficult thing to do when the in game economy is fucked because of their playstyle. Would make sense if it was singleplayer 
---
LOooL...u are right. Holy shit the ammo just wanishes
---
The lone wanderer didnt have a speach option for remembering anything before the bombs fell when talking to Dema. Considering that the main characters in NV and 3 had dialog options that has information that we the player didnt know (the couriers travel history comes to mind, but thats obsidian), then by fallout storytelling rules, the lone wanderer is confirmed to have no memories from before the day the bombs fell. And therfor a synth, or suffering from side effects of the vault.
---
That’ll happen 
---
Plot twist: Real life is the simulation and fallout 76 is a game we play in the simulation. The key to escaping is beating the Grognak RPG in game.
---
...I mean, you're not *wrong...* I'm mostly blaming that strange start on Vault-Tec, though. I still think 76 isn't *actually* a control Vault, because if it were, it should've played out exactly like you said, which would probably lead to it being like Vault 8 turning into Vault City. But instead, they deliberately got a bunch of highly accomplished, highly competitive, people, shoved them in a Vault for 25 years where they're asked to do menial tasks which would've been wildly beneath them in their old lives, and then when the Vault finally opens, everyone is kicked out with little more than the clothes on their back?
---
Nah. I'm convinced 76 is actually an experimental Vault. ...I'm just not wholly sure what the experiment *is.*
---
Been posted several times. Also right in your face if you use the Beth launcher
---
Weird..
---
I think I got 1 pie in &gt;300 hours of Fallout 4. I've probably tried 6-8 times in 76 with no luck.

Seriously? Veterans were storing individual pieces rather than frames?  They wouldn't qualify as a veteran to me if they did that.   When I first started playing I snagged pieces way before I could use them.  I thought PA was a "find".  It isn't, once your high enough to use it, it's literally everywhere.  New players don't have any reason to precollect pieces and waste stash space on them.

I play as a sneak sniper so unless something suprised me, which rarely happens because I use vats like sonar, I don't get hit a lot, so I have a ton of stimpaks just from checking every chem box.
---
By lvl 12 I had finished the Responders including Firebreathers and started Mistress of Mysteries, by 17 MoS was finished along with the 1st section of Rose’s BS.   
---
There’s prob not even an easy fix
---
I agree all 3 of these suck (sorry).
---
Fully unlocked PvP?  Looting all your stuff - besides Junk?  Then what stops this from being an open world mess of people just killing each other and lower level players being scared to ever want to play for fear of losing stuff that's valuable to them but just scrap to the level 100 guy.  Bad idea - don't ever want to see this.
---
Charging to switch servers - bad idea because its clear we have server issues still and until they are 100% solid and fixed, you cannot do this.  I get disconnected from servers all the time (most likely due to dupers but what do I know).  However who's to say I'm leaving and hopping vs. a real disconnect?  Also if I pull out my wired network connection, my wifi signal is crappy, or I just lose internet, will you now charge me to go back on because clearly I'm "hopping"?  There is no difference honestly between logging out to log in, losing connection and logging in or even having the game crash completely and I'm now logging back in.  The logistics to this one alone would be a nightmare to track.
---
I'd rather see resources go into this game to develop more of the stories, more of the interaction of players (teaming up - not beating each other up) and ultimately making things more fun overall.  Survival game this is - but moreso against the world being nuked - not against other players.
---
My kingdom for that weapon... Being level 26 and all :P 
---
It’s easier for duos honestly 
---
The mayors office. If you have marsupial or jetpack you can just walk into the building jump up twice an enter the elevator an you're there.  The safe next to the mayor has 8-12 plus the mayors body sometimes has extras. Also cleaning the building there is a few chem boxes around. Takes me about 15 min to collect 50-80stims. 
---
That's an L brother 
---
I FOUND a two shot explosive lever action with resistance while reloading. Pretty sure they have to be "looted" normally somewhere first before ever being duped 
---
I've seen it happen a few times, but only with glowing ghouls. 
---
The only common thing popping off are heads.
---
That's a strange attachment on your Mr. Handy...
---
I'm gonna be downvoted to hell, but this game has a lotta potential because of things such as this. Once they get the ball rolling and fix the bugs/add some npcs so that it won't feel empty I'm buying it.
---
Me and my gf play together LAN style right next two eachother and take a lot of photos together exploring the wasteland. Which really is our last remaining enjoyment playing this game. My gf logs on yesterday to find all of her photos(memories) were gone. 
---
If it’s possible I’d back up your photos somehow. Idk about you guys but If mine disappear that’ll probably be my last straw with this game. 
---
Wait until you’re near max capacity.
---
Check out the junk section and take some time to re-evaluate what you really need to store.
---
I have No limit on my Screws, Springs, Balistic fibre, Adhesive, plastic, lead.
---
Really if you’re storing so much of one thing it’s obvious you’re not using it so why keep it?
---
I ran into a max stash issue. I took some time and just dropped tons of junk I wasn’t obviously using. 
---
Lots of excess Aid stuff too.
---
I had 100 stimpacks in stash and 20 on me. Obviously I was finding enough stims.
---
So I gave a bunch away to random low levels.
---
Soon as I changed my hoarding mentality the stash lightened.
---
Also I manually add junk to my stash now instead of automatically dumping it.
---
I had so much cloth and leather.
---
They're still top tier melee weapons as long as they have good legendary modifiers.
---
It’s just kinda random from what I can’t tell.
---
huh....maybe it does, idk, I found one at the 50hr mark up near grafton, and I'm now nearing the 200hr mark, so it's been a while
---
If you can't duplicate it why are the details important, they really don't matter. 
---
EA or CD Projekt would never have released a game in this un-cat-tested state.
---
The beauty of it is that your bounty is based on the NUMBER of times you damage an enemy item. If you damage their entire base just once but very very hard, only 10 caps :)

Once you join and become General you can also purchase them from the vendors inside.

There's some research in a terminal about a sonic disruptor to make them land. Sadly, it doesn't appear to actually exist as a thing.
---
Lighting them on fire with a legendary that does that seems to help somewhat.
---
If you can keep things somewhat horizontal, you can dodge through the screech projectiles Doom style. If they come down vertical though, the splash is going to get you even if you avoid the main hit.
---
Obligatory “was this on playstation” but I watched a nuke go off on the Golf Resort from my camp. Didn’t walk over there since im level 14
---
I have a level 5 explosive pump action shotgun, but it's a two star that doesn't have the two shot modifier (extra damage to mirelurks is the second effect). From what I understand two shot on a shotgun only adds one extra pellet, so it isn't the best combo (I may be wrong, just parroting what I've read others say). It still does decent damage on some higher level mobs. I got this one from leader of the pack event.
---
Bloody mess is a luck perk and grants 5% extra damage rank1 10% rank 2 15% rank3
---
Wouldn’t know if you could duplicate it without the details. Use your think box my dude.
---
Time = Money
---
Money is virtual
---
We are all in a simulation
---
No I still don’t think that fixes it. They’re broken as hell in pvp and pve and mainly the only reason other than caps people are duping so constantly.
---
I enjoy having over 500 lbs of carry weight with Excavator calibrated shocks. After I crafted X-01 but didn't have X-01 calibrated shocks, I ended up only equipping the X-01 torso for the Jetpack making it easy to swap just 1 piece to get the full excavator carry weight bonus again when needed. Very happy that the prototype X-01 has the same color scheme as the excavator so it doesn't even really look mismatched.
---
No point staying connected when only a server wipe is going to fix the flood of duped items
---
I could see this being abused unless it cancels the reload in progress instead of completing it and just cutting the animation. If you mean just switch weapons and cancel the reload, I'm on board!
---
Yes, and they're insanely powerful.  Instead of firing 1 bullet at a time, it fires 2 for the cost of 1 bullet.  Both bullets also explode.  So you can stack Rifleman AND Explosives perks on it.  Currently really too OP, and I own a few :)

I’ve turned in game chat off for everyone but my team since the first day. I had just gotten to the first vendor bot I had seen and was checking things out and these two guys started talking mad shit to me and I got all flustered thinking I was doing something wrong :( I have a feeling they were trying to get me to PvP or I was at the vendor for too long and they needed to trade.  
---
I agree but I think hp and dmg as well as tse need to be evaluated, I’d love to play pvp but even the pve is broken currently

Oh just like campfires

Well you can’t say anything for sure but it’s definite that the queen gets buffed the more players that join the event. What do you think?

I would sell it but I see that you are on Xbox. I am on PC :(

The whitesprings bunker terminal has the minutes of a cabinet level meeting where the president is being briefed on the VSS. OP is not pulling this out of his butt. The robo brain is a reach. The theme in the game that keeps getting mentioned about nothing being real and this being a "dream" is found in random locations and the sole wandering NPC in the game says nothing is real its all a dream
---
I'm always on Team channel because Area doesn't work well when grouped. Having teammates fade into silence isn't helpful.

Finally, a workshop people will put the effort in to take.

Then they will nerf it, just like the ammo factory and fusion core generators, so that 99% of players ignore them and just farm ammo/cores by shooting shit up and pray to RNGesus. 
---
Damn, this game could be A+ if the balance team got their shit together. 
---
For leather armor craft light leather.  It's cheap and you get most of the materials back.
---
Probably works for other armor as well.
---
Note, there are some mods that you don't seem to learn from scrapping (Brotherhood, Deep Pocketed, etc).  Gotta get those from vendors or trades.

---
It already doesn't feel empty. It's buzzing with activity everywhere you go with a thousand things to see and do. Don't believe the memes. 
---
A bit riskier, but you can run Whitesprings without the nuke. Just hit and run the high level ghouls in the surrounding area, then let them chase you back to the robot security you can mop them up. Most ghouls have trouble attacking you on the car tops so you can use them as islands on the way back to the bots. Just make sure to take them with a shot and be sure to avoid tagging the security as they’ll turn on you in an instant.

Make sure to turn on pacifist mode if lobbing nades in a nuke zone.
---
(If it's possible) I do know a surefire way to get rid of ALL the duped items, but it would be unfair to anyone who played it after.
---
Pretty much just rollback the servers to the point before the dupe was discovered and go from there. But I don't think they would do that. At least I hope they don't even think of it

I am at work for another 5 hours or so but I definitely will once I get home.

Takes up 10 in the stash just like it always has... what is the trick actually doing? I must’ve missed it 
---
Heavy weapons I use:
---
Gatling gun:. Very ammo efficient and great at taking down anything.  I kill myself a lot with it...
---
.50 Cal:. Better than Gatling at damage due to its rate of fire, great against SB Queen.  Eats ammo slightly more than Gatling gun.
---
Harpoon gun, flachette mod:. Unlimited ammo.  Powerful damage.  Really fun.
---
Minigun:. Eats ammo so I never used it much
---
Light machine gun:. Seemed more accurate than the others, but much weaker.
---
Why are they only trapped momentarily?
---
The dupe exploit involves two players and logouts so that's probably why they disappeared. You probably don't want to be caught with that stuff when/if the hammer comes down.
---
Nice, where is this location?
---
Well yeah, if given the opportunity, I would gladly list things I would otherwise have dropped on the ground on a vendor.  I think it's likely there'll be at least some added overall storage space along with vendors.  They've mentioned looking in to gradually increasing STASH size.  So it's not out of the realm of possibility that they could increase it and use that added headroom to give vendors some space.
---
I think you're right that if it were unlimited, it could easily get out of hand.  I'd have 100k items on vendors in the first week.  Some limit is likely.
---
For that last bit, yeah its just a default.  When I see something or trade something, it pulls a default price.  I'd gladly list everything for the default price.  Vendors like mine are you may or may not find a diamond in the rough.  Ammo, yeah i think they need some bulk mechanism for it.  So you could list a stack of 100 for 1c if you wanted.
---
For the discovery of good vendors.. its tough to say how they might be thinking of implementing that.  They do have a underlying theme of discovering and grinding by server hopping, and things like that.  Just sheer luck unless you abuse some mechanism like server hopping.  So i wouldn't rule out that they would just let that happen.  Although of course it'd make more sense to have some sort of locator mechanism that could search a database and find a vendor for you.
---
Haha thanks though :D
---
I guess we both got our wishes through 
---
I found out when I went to send a screenshot I took to a friend and all my pictures were there
---
Are these this week’s codes?
---
!remindme 1 day
---
just started a new character and just saw this! 
---
Abraham Lincoln because the vault actually held him in stasis and he has returned with melee weapons and black powder vengeance for the new threat to America. Communism. 
---
I would never consider selling my maps, they have a chance to spawn rare Plans, and Legendary Weapons/Armor, which you collect at your current level, which is why I waited.

The one thing I would ask them is to have some sort of grace method to get back on the same session you were on or give us the ability to choose them. 
---
Having to disconnect or CTD and could never get back on the same session unless on a team or with friends is kind of annoying. Specially regarding workshops and events. 
---
Bugs I can deal with, but it feels of a progression loss like if you are trying to clear a cell but now you have to start over again. 
---
I'll see if it was resolved later or he just restarted
---
Wait till you stumble upon a bag with 1000 of ever stable flux. Kind of makes up for me opting out of PVP entirely but still loosing my junk to A-holes quite often.
---
Thanks. Best I'm looking for a furious explosive or a two shot explosive?
---
Does it actually kill you, if it does would it just be easier to avoid the situation since loot &lt; risk?
---
You can get Deep pockets, Ultra light and Dense from scraping it’s just the the odds are so low that it’s basically fluke and in mists cases you’ll be needing to get plans. But not always. 
---
I rarely dc.  Bethesda can redirect ppl to troubleshoot their internet.
---
They cannot redirect duping.
---
300hrs. 
---
I laugh at all of the people that say this game it’s shit, especially when I see stuff like posts like this that show people are playing.  People are putting a lot of time into the game, yet still find new stuff daily. 
---
As a melee character too, we need the equivalent of Dragonrend or the game sucks.
---
They have no chance to spawn legendaries and the plans are not very rare
---
Reclamation day participants ... obviously
---
K sweet
---
How deep does the rabbit hole go?
---
So you can obtain a full suit by the time you can use it? I was able to step from raider-t45-t51b-t60 at each of their respective levels (15-25-30-40) by doing this. If I hadn't have been collecting, my suits would've been mismatched likely up until I made my x01.
---
I've been snuck up on a few times in a 4 they spike the mini nuke down like a football sometimes its funny
---
Some people just buy and sell though and maybe didn't dupe themselves but legitimately have alot of TSE variants
---
Ron Pearlman
---
I wasn't able to wear a hat with it. I went back to the gas mask because I can wear a hat with that one 
---
I have considered selling a couple legendary handmades to a vendor just because I dont want to hassle with trading. I have three, I use the double explosive hand made, but I have two one stars that I dont need. One is a bloodied, and one is a quad. I thought about modding them up and then selling them just so I dont sell handmades to a vendor since theyre sought after though. 
---
...maybe I'm just an idiot, but, what do you mean by them being "animated"?
---
It's because super mutants forget who they were when transitioning from human to super mutant.
---
In West Tek there's a holotape on a surgery table that has a recording of FEV trials, in the recording the scientist asks the newly transformed super mutant if he remembers who he is. In the end he ends up going on a rampage and killing the scientist because he forgot where his wife was and thought they took her from him.
---
Don’t put limitations on someones speech. OP had a concern I asked for details. You want OP to shut it. Then you swing wildly at me for saying that it’s not a concern and get cranky pants about using the words think box instead of brain. What’s your end game my duder? 
---
Thanks for the reply, although I thought I was just following the main story. Maybe I need to find some side quests then.
---
what fun with not being able to run for 10 days? so many other ways to earn caps. 
---
Anyone who's earned one legit hates dupers, I hope.
---
They were for a day they were fine yesterday though
---
Would suggest listing what system you play on
---
What platform?
---
My friends and I like to run through this cave a bit because all the dead scorchbeasts have a chance of being lootable and they can drop some of the rare scorchbeast drops. All the glory almost no hassle
---
what /u/Dan00007 said and also, we mainly use the Daisy rug as it has the smallest collision box itself (the little round rug)
---
Same, I’m on a base PS4 and blue screen app crashing once an hour is basically a fact of life this this game. Especially if you’ve just built up a workshop! 
---
Yeah, I used to run a mod of this with a working Jetpack and it made FO4 AWESOME.
---
Actually you don’t. 
---
Exactly what the other guy said, if you're dead set on only ranged get the pen perks for your weapon of choice (tank killer, stabilized, etc) and the dragon isn't very good at the queen in general just not enough DPS, use a furious weapon (more damage per consecutive hit) or a two shot explosive. The red fire bullets are explosive bullets they are the best ranged weapons in the game. 
---
 Ah. Good to know. Thank you
---
Be really nice and kill him.  You get caps, he gets mission access again.
---
I have never found a plan with a level requirement? I can craft items with various level requirements, but I've never seen a level requirement for a plan. Do you have any screenshots? Because this will drive me nuts.
---
It was implied that they aren't looted only bought from dupers lol
---
What platform and gamer tag? 
---
Hunters club near Grafton. I just kill so.. so much. Maybe if it had the total number killed displayed underneath. 
---
Vodka? 
---
My game experience changes day to day but there is always something weird happening. The weirdest thing I’ve seen was something that looked a wall of colored rain. It looked like it was raining paint in a big square. 
---
Holy shit man that's terrible. I remember selling you 35 maps last week. Good luck with getting this corrected.
---
Your normal armor has no effect while you're in power armor. You could pull it all off and leave it back at CAMP if the weight makes a difference to you. Be aware that you'll be very vulnerable if you ever have to step out of your power armor, for example to craft something. (Scrapping you can still do in PA, but crafting or repairing you cannot.)
---
Luckily those big fat metal fingers don't seem to impede typing on terminals or manipulating lockpicks.
---
I use area chat and hear plenty of people. Sometimes you have to talk first.
---
In 4 it is instant death unless you have strong power armor
---
I was at the Watoga vendor checking which chassis was which suit and had them all out inside the building. As I am snapping the pic I have a Mr Gutsy flying in and start shredding me
---
Radrats with landmines are a thing too.
---
They're scary
---
I would be fine with *any* NPCs at all
---
Voice acting has been the best since their last games. By far. 
---
What they can do is what they did in F3 to put a time label on the tapes to know how long they are or to see a time stamp. 
---
Do the Major quest. Once you are Mayor the Robots won't target you. Let the end solve its self. ;)
---
I rarely DC aswell, but for some people it might not be a case of their internet, I've seen people go 4 full days without DCing and then the next day DC 5 times in 2 hours. Sometimes it's just that their servers are having a bad day or are overloaded
---
I experimented with this quite a bit and so far nothing is equipable with the scout mask.
---
Is it really *interesting* if they don't do anything 
---
Jägermeister, and a finnish national drink gin original 😁
---
It keeps crashing today as well. For my mates as well. Fortunately not on the Queen. I Will take the small wins in game 😁
---
Ouch, I had a feeling it wasn't good.
---
Does anyone know the requirements to trade with them? I found him a few times but trading wasn't an option 
---
i had a 3 start super sledge at one point, she was 40% more attack, something with vats, and less weight. 
---
i also sold an instigating grog axe, those two weapons one hit mostly everything. 
---
if you’re in the market for a good weapon, go with anything that has instigating, more attack power, +strength; less weight and or bloodied. those were the greatest when i was a melee build. 
---
Yeah but when you've bought several tse weapons you knew what you were doing and I'm sure was completely aware you were buying duped items.
---
I don't trust anyone that uses the "heart" emote, guess I'm just hardened over years of being screwed by other players in games
---
You say that, but I've found three TSE weapons on vendors so far.
---
Being a truck stop ain’t as bad as it sounds 
---
It actually feels like you are a red rocket gasoline station, when a group of three or four park their power suits, add a Power armor station and repair, some sleep and a few unload their stuff before moving on 
---
It actually makes me feel useful with my level 9 :D
---
Darth Vader
---
I hope they add more mods for weapons in next dlc
---
Uniquely tagging every piece of gear in the game would further cripple the servers.
---
Almost everything in the game besides nuke zones are fairly easy difficulty. All those suits of armor are absolutely unnecessary at those levels. If you use the raider armor until 40 you’re not gonna notice much difference.   I’d rather save the space and just pursue it when I actually need it later on. 
---
Keep checking the production terminal in the bunker, there is a mask for the urban scout armor. I believe I got my mask doing Enclave missions though. 
---
There are some glitched textures which could be it. If you are on PC, and it occurs after VATS, then just kill an enemy and it will go away. Sorry if this isn't much help.
---
tile, light lenolium, dark lenolium, vault-tec floor, one outfit, some baseball caps, the canopy, the table with umbrella.. so mostly camp stuff. might be something else.  haven't paid for atoms yet either.
---
I don't doubt eventually something will pop up that i'm tempted to pay for but it hasn't happened yet.
---
I use a TSE .50 for queen, a TSE Gatling for general use, and a 3* baton for close quarters use mainly.
---
Furious explosive would be fun.  I wonder if there are two shot furious explosive weapons...talk about OP!
---
Yah I remember u too. Thanks for the support and I really hope I can get this figured out 
---
I also cant spawn anywhere except for where i was hiding when i died!
---
I grew up with a John Denver loving father
---
as a melee/heavy weapons user its worth it to take 3 ranks in enforcer and carry around a shotgun. each rank gives shotties a 10% chance to cripple, so 30% chance to cripple for each pellet. i usually get them to land within 1 clip on a pump action shotgun.
---
I mean for it to actually spawn
---
Yeah exactly.
---
I remember tuning into streams for the sole purpose of tracking people down and murdering them in hilarious ways. Like turning into a vase and hiding for hours in their world.
---
I'm going to guess that you're on your way to the glass caverns am I right? And you're holed up in that little cement building with the security gate?
---
:0
---
My Buddy Has a Level 15 TSE Shotgun. Takes care of everything when stuff gets shifty.
---
Dunno really, I mean, roaming can get boring even with NPC's and stuff.
---
I'll give it a try once I get some cash going my way, thanks :)
---
As i'm playing with a controller at my desk i use the keyboard for PTT (bound it to &lt;Crtl&gt;). Yeah, a dedicated button on the controller would be much better, but it's workaround i can live with for now.
---
Mine was to shotgun her parts until she was paralyzed, now it's to heavy gun her parts until she's paralyzed
---
Kosher mane! I’d done the same. Just can’t play with some people. 
---
Oh cool, haven't done much with the prison
---
The Silver Shroud near the Mystress of Mysteries home bat cave
---
Yeah I was at west tek and I heard the ticking noise and nearly shat myself. 
---
Yes! Except i was only trying to mark places on the map
---
The”npc thing” is totally irrelevant. That’s something the reviewers have really latched onto.
---
Thanks for the tutorial - I can hardly wait to enter a nuke zone as a level 9 newb and emerge as shirtless ripped and battle worn god of war 😤
---
Always looking for help! newbie who plays around 1030PM EST. I don't have anyone who plays Fallout, so it would be great to throw some on!.
---
GT: IrishMrKiwi
---
Oh obviously. You better sign up to be a detective asap!
---
the trade bug had been disproven. it was but a reddit rumor to make people afraid of trading when dupes were flooding the market.
---
It gave me flashbacks
---
oooo thanks for the heads up
---
I'm running a melee/rifle build so spare perk points are not available. It's all about the damage.
---
That's a major exploit. You take a weapon with a large chamber capacity or say a lever action and cancel it then you cancel out that entire mitigation factor. I don't see this happening
---
Yes, I've got the mask already. I'm looking to wear something else on my head while wearing that mask ;) 
---
That's another thing. Why can we not grow our own cranberries, starberries, and firecracker berries? Unless you know a specific spot for them, they're rather hard to come by (with the exception of cranberries).
---
The scorchbeasts are circling where i died so whenever i spawn i dont have a chance 
---
it blew up on me but i was able to get away in time. i have marsupial, but even then it gives you a few seconds to run away before exploding. the blast is really small, almost like the bomb is a dud
---
TSE weapons are just a way to show off that you can buy something and not work for it.
---
Just to prevent confusion, the F04 main character is the Sole Survivor, not Lone Wanderer. LW is F03
---
Same they have become crutch weapons
---
They can't hear you because they're on team chat.
---
No lifers huh? I work a full time job and have a LV 160 character
---
Hmm, that kinda sucks. I was hoping there'd be some combat helmet or something I haven't found yet that might be compatible. 
---
it’s long dead man 
---
I believe razorgrain soup is even more nutritious.
---
Some people are just slow and inefficient
---
The legendary ruined the game, but with something that has to stop the melee op
---
What next door?
---
I just use the cannibal 3 perk with lead belly 3. I don’t really carry stimpaks. I also don’t have to carry much food.
---
Yeah, I immediately sold my gas mask with goggles when buying this one, thinking I could keep wearing my Cowboy Hat... 
---
Is that still happening to people? I tried to replicate it on multiple accounts on multiple PCs with every mod combination I could think of on tesla rifles and never crashed once.
---

&gt; TSE users
---
So everybody?
---
Fawt travel outside near location. Otherwise they are stuck indefinitely due to weight lol
---
That's what I have read from several players, but, I'll find out soon, as I plan to go treasure Hunting as soon as I get my weight down.
---
What they should do, regarding the patch notes, is release them as they do them. Example would be the first thing they did for the patch would be 'Increase stash size to a bajillion' and then add it to the patch notes on the website, or even a reddit post. Next one is 'Removed all duped items' add that to the list. 
---
It would actually be a decent way to keep in contact with the communtiy aswell as being able to see if something they add is a bad idea or could use some tweaking.
---
As for rejoining a server, what should happen is if you crash/dc, when you get back to the main menu, it should check to see if you've been in a server within the last 10-15m and ask if you wish to rejoin.
---
Instigating, Faster Swing Speed, Executioner. 
---
Double damage on first hit
---
Fast swing for 2nd hit
---
+50% on 2nd swings if target below 40% health (with Instigating, baring Serra Bravos it should be)
---
Vampire is only really good on Fast attack weapons as it is a set amount per swing.  
---
I can see this being useful if someone wants to collect a full set up Power Armor before they reach that level. For example, to collect a full set of Raider Power Armor before you reach level 15. I could have done it this way but I was being very careful to not use more than one Power Armor frame and I wanted to use the frame itself for the built-in buffs. Therefore, I ended up just storing the power armor pieces in my blue stash box back at my camp.
---
I agree and I have a TSE 50 cal.. Almost no point in playing the game now.. Although I did use it to destroy a guy and his base who kept killing my teammates. 
---
I’m level 117 down for some nuke runs. Add me PSN: mtsoccerman
---
The frame takes up 10 regardless of what parts are attached to it. Players cannot enter a frame with higher level parts. So you remove the parts, enter the chassis to claim it, then get out of the chassis and put the parts back in so they aren't taking up an additional 40+kg in your stash, since them being on a chassis completely nullifies their weight as it doesn't increase the weight of the chassis.
---
There is definitely truth to this but even in the bog with wide open fields and no obstructions, sometimes they just do not land. 
---
With my melee/explosives character it's a 50/50 chance whether they will land in the first few mins and get creamed or simply refuse to land and I sit there wasting my stims for lackluster loot :/
---
Same shit happened to me. I killed as many of the scorched as I could so they would stop coming into the building, popped a few rad-x and crouched to go into sneak and waited until it went back to hidden and fast traveled away. I made the mistake of going down there at a low level so needless to say I died a lot in the process of killing the ground enemies and hiding from the scorchbeasts.
---
What platform you on? I'm looking for TS weapons ATM.
---
I also have a grain farm but wasnt sure if that was a water only. I'm also herbavore so it helps a ton more.
---
she was born from radiation. offcourse radiation makes her stronger. (facepalm)
---
The manual is written in universe, and specifically calls the game Simtek.
---
Okay will do 
---
darn, I was kind of hoping for a SNL Macgruber moment. 
---
This deserves a nuke.  Reserved for jets....
---
Why didn't Bethesda put this in the game? It would have made things bloody interesting if you could discover something like this in Vault-tec U. It doesn't have to be obvious, it can go into yet another file in yet another terminal in one of the offices. It says a lot when the community have to come up with an explanation for the very basis of the game!
---
pieces with +1 Strength and high damage protection
---
i do that too, but I like to use vats a lot 
---
Good luck!
---
It's a calculated risk. Either I buy nothing I have interest in or I take occasional risks. Bioware still has one freebie with me. 
---
Good to know the team's been made aware of this idea! It's been my one main gripe with the game since the beta - as it is currently, with how easy it is to end up with builds that can take enemies out in a single hit or two, it's too easy for it to end up feeling like you're competing *against* your teammates for XP, rather than working together *with* them as a team.
---
I'd love to get furious and faster fire rate guns over TSE right now.
---
Once you have one or two TSE, you don't really need anymore of that type.  I'm kinda tired killing myself with those things...
---
Add me as well (Stav80ros) Lvl 51ish, 35 year old M
---
The bubblegum you get with each pack was definitely a nice little touch. Definitely want to say that. 
---
They will be adding dev notes to each change now. To Bette help understand each change. 
---
I'm looking for unarmed weapons with the furious affix.   
---
have you got any of those?
---
Oh thank god.
---
This comes down to your machine not being able to process textures. Turn down the in-game effects
---
What are some of the random encounter spots? I'd like to take a look myself!
---
That's been my face each time. I've been doing the daily 200 caps per faction vendor run and lucked out a few times.
---
Ok what's TSE? I have to ask 🤓
---
I just submitted a ticket to bethesda. Is there anything else I can do to contact them that u know if?
---
Glad to find more Xbox players! 
---
I’m about level 30, just enjoying the game.
---
I game in the evening PST usually (after the little guy goes to bed)

SPOILER There is datamined info that future content will involve you becoming the President via the Enclave faction. That’s where all the dormant polling stations and restricted Presidential suite (and datamined “President” power armor skin) will come in to play. We will also definitely learn more about this at that point.
---
This \^
---
Im level 100 something and have barely done any quests. 
---
Spot on. I got marine wetsuit from C2 no luck on the helmet (it does spawn there tho), but I did finally get the helmet plan from the train depo west of Watoga.
---
Mission access?
---
If there was a hostile enemy nearby he couldn't leave, trap a cricket between bookcases and let the pain continue.
---
Me too. That doesn't mean it doesn't spawn, that just means someone got it first. The train car is a really common spot. c2, not so much. There's 2 enemies to kill and rad water. Who wants to deal with that? Lol. Seriously though, all these objects spawn at world creation. You can tell because other things are gone if someone's been there. Like a cap stash. I've hopped for excavator calibrated shocks for hours, and learned every item in that shed. Never found the plans and not the cap stash. There's not many items at those two spawn points so it's much harder to tell.
---
Will this work with fusion generators? I hate that I can’t fit one inside a one story house 
---
Ah, the only encounter I’ve had with a mothman was at sugar grove, I fast traveled there, and he immediately vanished after I saw him. It freaked me out 
---
Doesnt help that im only level 17, im possibly trapped forever, also silly me being overcumbered! Ive died so many times from radiation im practically a scorched, something about i gained blight
---
For somebody that hates FO76, that nasally fat weasel just cant stop talking about it.
---
I've been lucky enough to just sprint away and gorge myself on StimPaks when this happens to me. The Scorched will follow me round Perdition's gate, but the Scorchbeast tends to overfly an area, so you might be able to run away. Unfortunately, if your experience is anything like mine, I'm out of food, water, and chems by the time I get enough distance from the monsters to fast travel away. :-(
---
If you weren’t high enough level for the armor on the frame you would strip it and that would also take up stash weight. 
---
OPs trick has it so that the entire frame plus armor pieces take up 10weight. It makes the PA frames their own containers for the armor pieces. 
---
Idk some sort of a cruture not relevant to my questen. Bhert ill invastegate mour closesly.
---
&gt; It's my understanding that explosive weps are always 2+ stars. 
---
They are, it's just that the prefix doesn't matter and isn't worth mentioning unless it's two-shot.
---
No one proudly advertises their Ghoul-Slayer Explosive Shotgun.
---
One almost got me at the west tek facility. 
---
From *before* day one - I was genuinely surprised when I tried the beta and found out it works this way, as I'd kinda just *assumed* Team members would share XP, since that's kinda how every other game tends to handle co-op.
---
“Are you Crazy?”
---
Aww that's super upsetting. I absolutely love the idea of wandering around in T-60 with a Laser or Plasma rifle but it just isn't practical at all.
---
Should have*
---
Last night I got into a fight with a scorchbeast. We fought for 30 minutes, with me hacking it with my Black Diamond ski sword whenever it landed. Also fighting off the stupid Scorched who kept attacking. I used up over a dozen stimpacks, but I got the scorchbeast down to a hair of health left...and got disconnected from the server.
---
Restarted, but the beast was back, at full health, and all the Scorched were back, too. Of course, all of my stimpacks were still gone. This wasn't the first time something like this has happened, but it was certainly the most painful and infuriating.
---
I've finally been put off the game, so now I'm just killing time until the Resident Evil 2 remake gets released. I'm no longer interested in even finishing Fallout 76 (and I originally enjoyed it).
---
huh, all my quest markers were gone.  I've only been wanted once though so maybe I was mistaken.
---
&gt; what about the guy who literally has "over a million pounds of junk in his stash".
---
Ban / wipe that account and add a hard carry limit.
---
Is there? I know there was one in fo4 as well.
---
Having two hazmat suits in my inventory causes the lower level one to disappear upon logging in. I was disconnected from a server wearing the one I could wear because the other was too high level; when I logged in this morning my character was naked and the hazmat suit was no longer in my inventory
---
There is. I cut the right one once when I found it in the dry lake bed by Lakeside Cabins. 
---
Its ok lol i am nothing more than human, as far as you know. And yes i am dying to know aswell. Because if it does shoot two archs i reall want to get one so i stop using my TSE weapons at whitesprings so i can just "tag" all the enemys and let others get their hit in aswell.
---
Though apparently it also makes your ass so fat not even the longest bench there is can accommodate you sitting on it.
---
Are you on PS4? Are you playing right now? What level are you? I can't be any help until around 1600 Central Time, but I'm happy to pop in and render any aid I can if you can hold out that long.
---
There is no reason for camps to be out there if over your carry weight go into the resort short walk I do it all the time any work bench you need is right there for you to make use of.  Just my 2 cents. 
---
I really like this 
---
Winning!!
---
You don't need to wait 60 seconds for it to be recalled, you can press a button to pick it up.
---
It's the spacebar on pc, not sure about console.
---
They are my favorite.

If ur anything but a melee then u need a TSE for the queen.  
---
Wow, TIL. Any chance you could name some or show a few locations on a map?
---
Will they only build on the "pit" kind of resources?  
---
These are great ideas dude 
---
THIS.  Wait 10 seconds and it can appear.   I've gotten all my crappy non-quest legendaries this way, and I think I missed out on other crappy leggendaries by looting immediately.  
---
(RNG gods hate me, I have bad luck in almost every game lol)
---
Highlight a door or extractor on build mode and hit L2 (on PS4) to lock it different on others
---
I completely forgot about that episode I feel stupid for not getting it now.
---
Hmm, doesn't mention it, but I've not tested it much since I wear power armor more often lately while I'm cleaning my stash out to reduce how much crap I'm carrying.
---
I'll have to pull it out and do some trials.
---
So why did vault 8, 13, 101 and a bunch of other vaults all decide to stick together in their technologically advanced, nuke proof base? And why didn't the overseer stick with the people she would have grown to love and respect as they start to rebuild civilisation and then once they're set up go and loom for her husband? All I'm saying is that Bethesda could have gone for a less shaky premise for this game. The vault start works for single player games, not for an MMO like this.
---
Pretty much. 
---
The percentage of players that have legitimately “earned” this weapon drop is so tiny compared to the duper’s (and those that purchased duped weapons) that it’s almost always gong to be a duped version
---
Before anyone claims 
---
“I got mine legit!!!!111one11!!!”
---
I DON’T BELIEVE YOU. 
---
Side note: I feel like this would add a new player based market that isn't ruined by dupes. *Yet...*
---
I also want to say that bubblegum you get with each pack was definitely a nice little touch.
---
It's possible for them to get suck in the Sonic attack mode and not move to another attack mode. They have the 3 attacks of sonic, area gas, and melee. I've had 1 or 2 cases where they get stuck in sonic, if they just sit there doing that attack it's best to break LoS with them and then come back.
---
duplicates of maxed cards are not worthless because sometimes you need a lower level card to fit in your build, for example, i use 5\* adrenaline for my shotgunner build but only 1\* when i go to sneak
---
if you have every star level of a perk (for example, 3\* slugger, 2\* slugger and 1\* slugger) you cannot select duplicates when you level up, dont know if you can still get it from perk packs but it stops you from taking fully "useless" cards
---
Yup PSN OtakuPsycho, im level 17, and i can wait, any help at all is great! 
---
I like the system, it's like the only hardcore endgame mechanic. I just wish the stash was 1000 so I could have some different sets of armor and weapon to swap around, instead of feeling forced to make a new character. I can't even stash some legendaries for sale, I need to get rid of them asap.
---
Yes you can't build it anywhere in your camp, it has to be specifically on the pit of that resource.
---
 Best suggestion I have right now would be to ask someone from your server or reddit who's high level to rescue you. That would also make a great love story.
---
Yeah that's classified as a disease. If you have antibiotics or a disease cure you can use that and it'll go away. Honestly, your best bet is drop what you can when you come back to life and then book it out of there and go as far as you can. 
---
What makes it group defendant? Is it soloabke?
---
Cool theory. Sadly isn't the case. Todd Howard confirmed that it's not a simulation in an interview.
---
Yup been through many QSB and WSR runs and not once have I seen any good legendary drop or a single TSE weapon.
---
It's past it's best before date.
---
In fairness people who put toilet paper on backwards, are no better than feral ghouls!!!!
---
You forgot the awesome jokes!
---
Would you rather have that, or dragon that does extra damage to robots or supermutants or scorched? I mean sure ultra low rate of fire weapon like Dragon with really long nominal range, might be more or less the only weapon where the stalker has some advantage over non-legendary dragon. Anywhere else it's just bad because the extra accuracy doesn't really help much while it consumes a lot of vats points.
---
On ps4 the game will occasionally get stuck flashing between normal and vats targeting during a fight. Super annoying.
---
Was on ethernet
---
Agreed. Whilst I’m largely boned when she’s flying high, when she hits the ground my spear stealth criticals right up her arse. That’s why she always flies, she can’t sit down since we met.
---
Haha we love a good fo76 romance, like the lusty argonian maid by post apocalyptic style
---
Uranium Fever. Just loot everything as you kill it and scrap it at the bench that’s there. 2-300 steel easy
---
Why should he have to get off because of your frame issues?
---
I don't think I've ever noticed. WOW... 
---
I've had my voice chat on "Team" since day 1, because of the aforementioned open mic abuse.
---
Different mods allow different power armor colors
---
I wouldn’t mind, considering the “golden” card you get from packs is animated and 90% of the time it is a perk I don’t use.
---
Would love to have animated cards for all my current perks.
---
The lack of animal testing is appalling 
---
No, needs to be dropped back to 400.
---
No, someone has to play music to summon a legendary windigo while the other has to fight off ghouls. Unless both of you are over level 70 I would get 3 or 4 people.
---
TSE didn’t kill the barter economy. A pool of bad alternative weapon perks did.
---
ah gotcha, though you were looking for the stealth effect specifically. 
---
I said that in my post, I guessed that's why, obviouse game design but in the past, Bethesda just changed stuff into short hair which would be better than the cap, also with helmet as a separate item, it'd be even better
---
Why are you disappointed in Bethesda? You're level 17 in the end game area, the place where SBQs spawn, and over encumbered. How did they do this?
---
Tonight Some Eggs
---
OMG, must protect imaginary internet points :)
---
Get out of here with your logic! But i completely agree. Same with Condition. It's all part of a survival game.  
---
We should be grateful we can still repair broken legendaries.
---
Insert World of World of Warcraft joke, where you play a person playing WoW in a basement. Or a person playing WoWoWoW in a sub-basement. Does that make the game character you are playing, more consequent and consistent than you? What about when you turn the game off but your life continues? How is your WoWoWoW character one of the most consequent and consistent people out there? Just wondering.
---
I knew about recreating the weapons at higher levels but I didn't think about checking on being able to do that with the garb.  Thanks for pointing that out!  I wish I knew how much extra damage the voice of set does to robots.  It's noticable though if I compare it to my .44 of the same level which only does 2 more base damage.
---
To me it's more to do with the market getting flooded, duping speed it up significantly. The only two things that would work, make all items personal or make a ladder system and ladder only items
---
In my experience putting BoS on Heavy Combat armor seems to remove the 'heavy' bit from it, but I've only tried it with one or two peices so could be wrong
---
The mask takes up the entire head slot, unfortunately :(. I still love it though, rocking my set of lvl 50 Urban Scout, fully ultra light and polymer. I'm saving other 3* armor in hopes that one day we can disassemble and apply the legendary modifiers ourselves...because, of course, Scout doesn't come in Legendary.
---
Okay.  There was some veins in my camp, but they are not in a pit.  Dang.  I guess I'll just have to do it the old fashioned way.
---
Ok so first it's r/woooosh , second it's a reference to the show silicon valley, even if you didn't intend that in your original comment, someone thought of a joke, and they get that the pied Piper was a thing of its own accord
---
You should be able to respawn at Vault 76
---
&gt;From what I understand two shot on a shotgun only adds one extra pellet, so it isn't the best combo
---
It adds just one extra pellet ye, but also adds the full extra damage of another shot, it's one of the best along with bloodied 
---
„The disconne- 
---
I am always on wifi and I never have crashes and my internets really bad took me a 3 days to download 76. I recommend trying it on wifi and see if it fixes it
---
Did you eat paint chips when you were a kid? Or do you have some cognitive disability?
---
He bought them at 20 caps each. I’ve been playing since beta, and have found dozens, just like my husband. They aren’t worth doing to me, so I sell them, to guys like OP.
---
Stop hysterically chasing shadows. The pointing and screeching “REEEE CHEATER!” is not only wrong, it makes you look rediculous.
---
Dr. Dmitry already had a closeted drug problem before the vaults closed.
---
Being stuck in vault for so many years not do good things for Dr. Dmitry's mental state.
---
Since leaving vault, Dr. Dmitry has taken and dranken so many harmful substances that he is wholly immune to negative side effects.
---
Dr. Dmitry still take hippocratic oath very seriously. He share his stimpaks, heal with fire, and resuscitate with liquor.
---
Dr. Dmitry has also taken to carrying an explosive crank Gatling gun, because scorchbeasts hurt his ears when he's tweaking.
---
Dr. Dmitry not look very friendly, or very healthy, but he mean you no harm. Quite opposite really.
---
BoS provides better 'combat damage' protection but no rad protection, Trapper is cheap, light, no need for balistic fiber, and provides a good amount of rad res.  With lvl 45 set of it, and a single Rad-X it drops me down to 14r/s in nuke zones
---
How do you not suicide every time you pull the trigger? Exploding shotguns just seem like a bad idea for the shooter
---
I love the idea of having prerequisites for doing these events, but my suggestion would be that only the person starting the event has to have it. That way, your friends can still tag along with you. It's pretty annoying when my friend who hasn't done much story can't join me on Enclave events right now 
---
2 star lvl20 Small Gat - Ignores 50% Armor with Exploding bullets 
---
You were (are) but you are roughly at the mid-point or so of the story. Do some events and side quests. loot, craft and all that. you gain levels pretty quick in this game. The game is not a sprint it is a marathon. 
---
There are some quests you get later, like in Watoga that drop really nice weapons (All Rise...) and it is best to be high level when you do them so you can pull a maximum level version. DaisyCutter is another one that is a side quest that spawns following the main quest (right after rose). it pays to have your fancy 90% weight reduced Fat Boy be a high level!
---
Just another small addition that may be not know. That this set does not count as armor and the chameleon mutaion works with it.
---
Are you saying the damage from that extra pellet is as strong as a full additional shotgun blast? Trying to understand this due to the various things I've read people say on it. 
---
Yes, and Nuka World added homemade Nuka recipes along with many new variants.
---
I was unaware of it being end game area as i was passing through running around the map collecting and discovering locations, im disappointed as i genuinely might not be able to get out of the place which they could have made a respawn where you are taken back to your camp but instead im stuck and unable to get away
---
Honestly? I'm indifferent. I'm not interested in the "game economy" so I'm not buying or selling. I don't care if everyone around me has better weapons, also don't care if I happen to have a better weapon than most. My build could be horribly un-optimized, don't care. The armor/cosmetics I wear could be ugly as sin, or literally what everyone else is wearing, still don't care.
---
It's not a competitive game. What you do in game really has little effect on what I do in game. If you're slaughtering me instantly with your superior build and weapons, I'll just hop servers and continue about my business.
---
Nothing any other player can do will stop my fun, the worst they can do is to get me to "go around them" by server hopping.
---
Thank you I just reduced my stash size by around 100 because of this as I had two sets not on a chassis, thanks for the tip!
---
I thought I read somewhere someone was testing two shot on a shotgun and shot the side of a train. Several times. And only counted 9 pellets. So the two shot only added an additional pellet.
---
Missing quests is a bug that can always happen. Had that many times and never been wanted.
---
I looked to check but the option wasnt there :(
---
This is me at the crazy cat lady's house.  It was just creepy...
---

not even at the vault ?
---
I don't use any TSE weapons (as far as I know). I am looking for a maxed out sniper rifle (ballistic, not energy). Happy to trade or buy. WickedTimeLord on PS4.
---
Ants are awful to run into this game. They are dog size but low to the ground, hard to see in tall grass, and have a high damage resist. Not fun at all. And the little bastards are quick too.
---
Seems like a great way to get free stuff
---
Nope, there were no places i could spawn except for the place i basically died
---
oh no, not missing, like they all werent there, no map markers.  I dunno, I was super confused.
---
The first CAMP i was in was the overseer's, does this work the same way? I am only level 5, do i have the ability to setup a new camp or do I need to be a certain level?
---
well that's certainly good to know!  I still won't trade blindly with players if I'm not expecting anything...but glad to see it wasn't as big an issue as made out to be.  Now the dupes, yeah I can see that still being a problem, I for one don't have enough caps to buy anything, so all my gear is looted/quest stuff...so im not too worried about dupes at this point...plus I like to earn my gear and tend to not have things handed to me to make me OP (especially at lower level)
---
I have ants spawn by my camp once in a while,  in the savage divide. Last night I had a mothman spawn near by as well, it was the first time I saw one and now it is a pile of ash counting daisies
---
They'll come back, dont worry. 1000 atoms on sale down from 2500, 24hr limited sale.
---
"Best" depends on what you value, there is no clear winner.  For example Heavy Combat has the best dr/er/cost to repair ratio, Trapper is dirt cheap, and Light Marine is close to Heavy Combat in resistances but far lighter.
---
I buy every fallout game and I waited because of the bad press but I have to say I am loving this game it's a lot of fun.
---
I found one on a cliff north of Atlas.
---
Got to go with my wife to get drunk now but if not found help by tomorrow i`ll come bail you out.
---
I had one near the watoga power station on the east toward the mine with the mirelurk queen and possibly legendary spawn, and it was possums.  The reward was 250 xp and nothing else.  
---
Her dialogue was cute, but didn't say anything at the end.
---
I just found that for a second time the other day! I wish you would have cut the correct wire. I'm 0/2 and really curious what happens if you get it right
---
I was trying to let them refill, even punching with my fists, but several legendaries I ran into yesterday would not *mutate*.
---
Can more games use the Bloodborne movement system? I mean imagine the Witcher 3 but instead of driving a large boat when you move, you are super agile!
---
You could respawn at vault 76 then
---
OK. I'm WickedTimeLord on PSN. I'm a Level 38. Though I'm a sniper build I'll do whatever I can to help. I'll message you as soon as I get home.
---
Wait can you actually hit control to talk with?
---
Thank  you! Have a lovely time with your wife x
---
Ive found that sprinting and carrying max load or close makes me famished faster. 
---
On my sneak sniper build. Seriously i have food spoil long long before i need it. I mostly sell the canned goods and the cooked food to a point. My water farm is just easy income and a free juicebox now and then. 
---
My melee build. Wont lie. I want a character shared locker linking items. Itd be so nice to give him food and water because he burns through it
---
How do dupers break player vending? If anything they provide a much needed end game cap sink. The game already provides you with infinite duped items through cell respawns and vendor item regen. But these are far too slow/rare/unreliable by end game. How does buying 200 duped springs differ in substance from instancing sugar grove 10 times?
---
I don't trust beth one iota about being able to retrofit a player economy into a game that was clearly never designed around one in the first place. The PVE economy is fucking awful to boot.
---
I think you are entirely dillusional about the viability of the "long term player" base. This game hasn't sold well. People are clearly leaving. Players don't want to invest into unstable/unreliable games when there are so many objectively superior options.
---
If they wipe characters, that would be the end for this game. Enjoy playing your open world game that doesn't have any players in it anymore.
---
Did it crash when you were transferring to and from your STASH? 
---
That is my number 1 time I crash.
---
Did you record this?
---
From u/shoe_owner
---
Mine was just north of watoga east of the power station with the deathclaw spawn.
---
I was afraid that initial 500 atom offer was just bait for people to accept and make it harder to sue them down the line, and once they actually offered to send out bags that offer was off the table. I'm glad we ultimately get both.
---
I killed a level 87 as a 35 when he was trading at the Vendor LMFAOOO 
---
My main weapon is handmade rifle and a death tambourine and I got a suppressors handmade I was all excited when I got it only to realize it was lvl 15 when I was lvl 35
---
Fyi the reward for that quest is all rise, one of the best quest weapons in the game.
---
0_0
---
Ok my character now feels really 2 dimensional after reading this :D
---
Thanks to „The Vault Technician“
---
nah, if you want it back to proto type you're going to have to make another.
---
I wear the base dress because its the bestclothing you can wear with your armor. +1 Perception
---
Thank you my friend , i'll message you tomorrow if you have solved it 
---
whats up with his level 80 exactly?
---
I was at the Whitesprings entrance closest to their RR Vendor, and when I was walking in a Behemoth appeared right in front of me, wasn't ready and ran. Next thing I know about 60 robots come and start attacking, it was awesome, and laggy
---
When i team up it breaks local chat for me, then when i join an party people want to talk in the party because in game chat breaks all the time and they cant hear me..... then i leave the party and in game chat suddenly starts working. (this is on xbox)
---
The option isnt there, thats why ive come to the forum, it could easily be my server is being a pain but ive checked everything 
---
How do we get ours exactly?
---
It's a Monty Python reference
---
build it again
---
Super possible! And I like it!! I will be adding that to upcoming features. :)
---
MAZZIExISWT add me, anyone else can too just let me know you’re from reddit, I’m level 72(?) and am willing to help launch nukes or just mess around with events and such, I plan to be on this weekend quite a bit, and most of tomorrow
---
How did your friend’s character get glitched?
---
\&gt; &gt;Making Graham and Chally the battlecattle a boss
---
HOW ***DARE*** YOU.
---
Have you tried a relog? Vault 76 should always be an option
---
I fired 800 round with 1 proc of Luck Of The Draw (LotD). It most definitely did NOT save my weapon from breaking at the same rate it always does. Seems we gun users are forced to use 5 points intelligence for Gunsmith ... LotD will not save you.
---
I'll bring a bunk of stims and radaway.
---
I have a Workshop stlyed one too 
---
[I have a Workshop stlyed one too ](https://imgur.com/a/u4j1NMT)
---
Cool for you but I would reconsider interpreting my comment as a joke which it is
---
My group would. Actually we may prefer it. We probably wont make second characters unless someting like that happened but we would all build totally differently. I know we can respec as we level but its just not the same
---
Honestly, I'd like to argue that you should always be able to loot Legendary enemies, regardless of whether you even hit it - they're rare enough as it is, and with how many different Legendary items are available, it could still take ages to get anything you really want, even if you are getting them fairly regularly.
---
“The Reclaimers”
---
Shotgun Jesus :D
---
I think it might be within the safe zone.
---
And “guys”, not guy.
---
 I have quite a few Marine plans just from Harper's Ferry. They drop in the display cases in the area behind the hole in the wall. That extends to the top of the building there and you will have to use the tilted boxcar to get to the upper levels. 
---
 I go there a lot for trading so I check that area a lot.
---
does the whitesprings furniture plan seller have it?
---
Shouldn't spread false rumors, OP
---
Bethesda launcher. Select all games/ fallout 1 and install. Repeat for for 2 and tactics! 
---
Pretty sure basic train station vendors sell it once in a while.
---
You won a prize!!! (Proceeds to klll prize bot)
---
If you have excess plastic then bulk it and scrap it for a net of +5.
---
At the same time though, if you close the door first you can't sit down.
---
Lol you said effort.  He us right dude. It takes no effort to click a button and kill o things and screw everyone else out of any exp or loot. Come on. Seriously. 
---
And how can theyvuse molotovs when while its in the air one shit from you kills everything. I have TSE guns and know how it works.  I put then away in public events. 
---
Dont act like people who get screwed out of kills are leeching iff your 1 monstrous button click. 
---
Nope 
---
I like the area on the other side of that mountain, near Lucky's mine (lead and crystal mine). Easy access to the mine, not often attacked. A couple lakes above the mine to the left, easy to defend in the cut of the mountain also. Bonus, if you put artillery it can hit the east bend tunnel, the bos outpost (defiance I think) as well as the mine area as well.
---
Too funny, and you can't be a cannibal in your PA which is annoying.  
---
Thanks for this.  It comfirmed my gut feeling about Marathoner.
---
I wanna get in on the joke, but I'll be serious. It stands for Two Shot Explosive
---
Ahhh makes senses. Ha! Nice idea. :)
---
Yea, that’s better
---
Same.
---
I am inclined to agree with you but it's not a risk I would take personally, the game is easy enough with non legendary weapons anyways. I'm also sure the guys playing Neverwinter thought the same thing until they sent out those sweeping bans.
---
This is what I meant. There is not character stash, just inventory. I knew what the OP of this thread meant after I re-read it, but since this is a PSA for low levels, I thought I would point this out and possibly save someone some confusion if they had wanted to fix it.
---
I don't think it's in a specific location, I have seen it a few times from various vendors
---
I had someone do that to a workshop I had. A workshop. They didn't even take the workshop, just destroyed all the water purifiers, generators, resource collectors, everything, Then left. Some people are just dicks for no reason.
---
Pack up molotov, an hazmat suit and server hop till you find a nuked whitespring, follow high level players and tag everything. Bonus if you have well rest buff and food exp aswell. It takes few runs to reach 50.
---
Fortunately Bethesda has a product for people who want to play a single player game. It's called Fallout 4.  
---
Seeing as ES is my favorite series of video games, a love that is shared between my friends and I, and knowing that ES VI is in fact in pre-development and is next in line after Starfield.... I would love a 76-esque Elder Scrolls spin-off game.
---
But, we got ES:O instead, which is supposedly good, but not my cup of tea
---
Gonna relog again and see if it will work, its just so odd, unless the game is just having a rough time, it was acting up earlier and the whole application had an error
---
Is this when we are supposed to All Rise ? :D
---
My RTX PC also does that for first 10 seconds of playtime after loading in Whitesprings. The issue described is more severe - it means that sometimes you can empty twenty clips into air before a bugged monster loads.
---
From u/chaos_is_a_ladder, quoting me: 
---
There's a bunch. There's one on the highway just south of the Mothman museum. One just south of the Veiled Sundew Grove, a little bit past the monorail line. One on the road south of Harper's Ferry, just before a little overpass bridge. One of them just north of the Overseer's camp, in the grass to the east of the road. Those are the main ones I know of, anyway.
---
You will have to build it again. I think you can preview paints before applying them by just hovering over the option.
---
But god mode glitching does not matter in single player games, because you only ruin your own game with those.
---
And NV is Obsidian's game(like you probably knew).
---
would be excellent if you did capture this on video, people here were complaining about this happening but no one was able to reproduce the bug or provide footage of it happening :/
---
You can get them off of sentry bots still,  I think it's one or two. 
---
That’s correct, I never said anything about 2 shot on a shotgun. It’s always just added 1 pellet even back to fo3. And I’m fairly certain it’s 6 base and 7 with a 2-shot.
---
The mental picture of a doubled-headed sonic mooing attack helps me sleep at night.
---
I lost a mutation in the same session where I upgraded from 1 star to 2 star on the card.
---
Listen, Carol, Sharol, Crystal, Charlene, or whatever the hell you’re calling yourself now.
---
If you make fun of the size of my hands again, I’m going to choke the shit out of you. Got it?
---
Thank you so much, its amazing how helpful and kind people are on this game
---
Looking for a bloodied swing speed, buzzblade if you know anyone, will trade well for it
---
Wow, got enough salt on that dish?  
---
Was just letting you know it sounded weird, especially since this is a PSA for low level players. 
---
ah ok, I get it now .. thought i was a nuke event .. ok that makes sense ..
---
Every time I get a golden one, it's something like lock picking which it doesn't let you have more than one of. So I don't actually get the card.
---
Man, hope they fix that I might just wait for the BlackBird to appear in the Atom Shop again.

T-60 calibrated shocks are easy to get. When I was server hopping in Watoga trying to farm up full level 50 sets of T-60 and T-51b from all the power armor frames, I just kept checking the Brotherhood and the train station vendors, and I had managed to find a pair of shocks before I found my last T-60 piece.
---
I heard this glitch worked and tried with the welcome mats (like I used in 4) but whatever I placed on the mat didn’t move with it, only the mat moved separately. I tried it on foundation and just on the ground itself but neither worked. Any ideas?
---
It actually cancels the animation for full reloads, just not between shots. Pretty annoying with the Hunting Rifle. 
---
This is cheating, but as a workshop collector, it is a necessary one.  The need for acid is too high.
---
Yeah I know but it used the same framework as a BGS title, and In this game it’s just the weapons, it’s not like anyone is running around with infinite sprint or infinite HP or one shotting with fists. The god-mode was pre-built into this game via explosive weapons, the weapons are just vastly easier to access now 
---
That is true, but unless you really want that hammer, its so convenient to just wander about Watoga doing your business. I sold it myself. ;)
---
What about all those people killing queens before the first TSE? They weren't all Melee.
---
People also fail to realize that we are the first Vault that’s opened. WE are tasked with repopulating the world and such. Everyone says it’s boring and lonely - but the lonely part is intentional and I love it. I genuinely feel like I’m on an adventure. 
---
It's more like a tall glass of room temperature water.
---
This would be very nice. I have gotten Lockpick (not expert or master) 4 times from perk packs since I took it as one of my early perks. I have gotten Hacker twice, and Happy Camper every other pack.
---
Instead of rerolling, it would be nice to remove them from the pack rotation. It would still allow you to take a lower level as a regular level perk card.
---
I doubt we'd get a definitive "this is how the war started" tbh. Many theories have been put forward in canon and I think it's fitting that nobody really knows how it started.
---
On another note, would the Fallout series survive in China where there is no Americana?
---
Huehuehue
---
i can't really say that those patches helped anything so far. And as i heard the console versions are way worse than the pc version. At least that's what people usually say
---
This!
---
It is a bit of a joke though that in a trade you can look through someones complete inventory and even request stuff without someone noticing and no warning pop up menu's...i mean is this how Bethesda rates privacy as well :/
---
I'm building my level 50 set. Yes I had a level 40 set and used it a lot.
---
 I tossed the proto paint job on purpose myself. I guess I'll buy the camo from the store in a while. I will not pay for Atoms. ;)
---
Everything about that situation sucks dude. RIP
---
&gt; or I was at the vendor for too long and they needed to trade.
---
Probably this. For some stupid reason only 1 player can interact with a trader at a time.
---
Can we look at this briefly?  
---
The Milky Way is a galaxy, ok? Just establishing terms, after spending too much time in the No Man's Sky subreddit, where people get confused. Let's say the milky way has one hundred thousand million stars, that's what Google currently says. Imagine that life psuedo-randomly occurs once in every 200 million galaxies. What is the "correct" frame of reference for those odds? We don't know because we can't create life, and we certainly have no idea what causes sentience. So, instead of ten times per galaxy, let's randomly say, life occurs at the rate of 1 in 200 million galaxies.  
---
This means that oops, we haven't seen any life yet, but our universe could contain so many life forms we can't even fit the number in our heads.  
---
There is no paradox. Why would I assume that one out of every 500 desktop computers achieves sentience which can communicate with humans? We don't know anything about sentience, I have no grounds to apply any number to that guess. Except a wild-ass guess, which will probably (statistically) be as wrong as assuming my computer will start talking to me. Assuming that every galaxy of one hundred thousand million stars has to have life in it, is just a dumbness indicator that astronomical-scale numbers really don't fit into our human mind. If you take a very-slightly-astronomical-sized number for those odds, like 1 in 200 million galaxies, then there is no paradox.
---
I realized that at the end of the cave, one of the monsters was lootable, that's actually a nice idea.
---
It does both ways, i guess. But i was talking about the sprinting or standing still effect on the armor piece. It does reduce the damage big time. I what the damage is to myself, i don't know, didn't try out because i'm melee.
---
Stalker's is actually pretty damn good for a stealthy vats sniper build, especially for high damage weapons, the dragon, Gauss rifle, lever action, hunting rifle if they ever add legendary ones, etc. Especially when combined with grim reaper's sprint. You're nearly always out of combat, the extra AP cost doesn't matter because you're constantly one-shotting enemies. Having 100% hit chance at very long ranges is a godsend.
---
So yes, I would take Stalker's over any perk not named two-shot, exploding or instigating. The extra damage to robots or bugs or whatever is meaningless when you one shot anything not named Scorchbeast or mirelurk queen, while the nearly guaranteed hit at the very limits of vats range is particularly useful. 
---
So yeah, I get it that is the response we will see.
---
What you haven't caught me up on is what topic that is in reference to.  So, if you could compile that for me... Yeahhh....  that would be great.

I like this except the trigger for Rose's new gang. Just seems like it'd be going on constantly or not enough depending on event reset timer. 
---
I had a guy on release day call up a pizza delivery place and give them his credit card information, name, address ect while on open mic. Hopefully nobody bothered to record it ect. 
---
Lvl 19 in PA frame, wearing hazmat suit - Went into my first nuke zone.
---
Is 10+ rad constant normal when wearing a hazmat suit? I do not think they work together.
---
Well... yeah, can't really say it isn't. Just because someone else did something dumb doesn't mean you're not a jerk lol
---
**Abigayle Singh** 
---
Well, it's just an example
---
It just works...
---
I play with my kid and he has a friend we play with on xbox. both me and his friend and pack rats.... i was at 1500 carry weight earlier this week, then down to 1200 last night i got down to 400 something so i can move with excavator armor... i was like screw if picking up one random thing is gonna weigh me down ill just spec ap regen and pick up everything. his friend was at 800 something last night.
---
both me and his friend crash all the time... my kid who isnt a pack rat cause he likes to be able to fast travel almost never crashes and he stopped hording loot cause he only wants specific stuff now...
---
It got worse when i started collecting clothing
---
I opened an animated expert lockpick that I had already chosen many levels before and apparently the animated one is the one that decided to disappear into oblivion. Which sucks. 
---
I did not know of this...
---
You could totally rent that warehouse to a bunch of hipsters who want to gentrify the joint.  
---
I have a tendency to crash during respawn. I get the map, click the point to respawn and poof... the game closes.
---
Which is absolutely infuriating because it also means I lose my junk.
---
Yeah, I'd say it's probably one of those patches that fixed a problem some people had and caused problems for those who didn't. At least that should help them get closer to the root of the problem though
---
bloodbug proboscis, stingwing gland, radscorpion glands, wendigo teeth, yao guai
---
Giggity
---
So you are saying that if I want to play a multiplayer game from bethesda, I have to accept and live with the bugs/glitches that come with it? (Bugs/glitches that break the game) Thats not how you solve problems 
---
Oh I thought that was a glitch. 
---
I've been doing this for a while. I've been super busy so I'm stuck at level 30 until I get some more free time, but I've been leaving weapons, ammo, and plans from far off parts of the map in the first aid box on the wall outside the church in flatwoods, and/or dropping the loot in the funeral home there.
---
I just wasn't aware of how strong I was at that point, it is a normal one and it was kinda easy, the biggest problem was my guns were broken and the best dps was the leveler rifle.
---
Lol so is that a yes?
---
Fusion Cores are affected by Batteries Included, making it better than Power User since you can just carry ten times as many cores, which is better than your cores lasting twice as long.
---
Could you imagine beening stuck in a room with a cricket near you that you can't kill. My guess is that go insane and kill themselves trying to bust out of there lol. That or leave the server like a poor sport.
---
I get great effects on terrible weapons, rippers and such. I had a really souped up... is it a mr handy arm that looks like a weed whacker? Anyway I tried it just because the 3* stats and it took 10 seconds to kill something that takes 1 whack with my hammer.
---
If Bethesda bans people for duping they are ass holes.  The legendary drops are so far and few between its their own fault for allowing duping and for giving little to no other option.  Either make legendaries craftable or improve the quality and quantity of legendary drops.  Wood legs are 90% useless no one uses a fucking tire iron dont be assholes you get no benefit from increasing the grind in this game.
---
The whole fallout series is a simulation.
---
I dump stuff in the overseer's stash crate in the first church now and again, I guess it stays there...
---
Also should be mentioned the bar (forgot the name) just south of Charleston Fire Station (it also has the Miner Miracles posters and U-Mine It vendor) usually has a chasis downstairs with low level raider parts (level 15). 
---
&gt; green thumb or butchers bounty
---
That's exactly what I was gonna use as an example. I've got 3 Perception on my main character solely for lockpicking and I've also got the Carnivore mutation, so when I'm not picking locks I've got Butcher's Bounty 3 on. However, when I'm, say, farming a nuke zone, I'll put on my Butcher's Bounty 2 and Green Thumb for double flux pickups.
---
Hahahaha I was wondering why he did that! Thank you for the replies
---
To remove the lock, tell him to enter the menu where he made the lock originally. One of the options is to unlock or remove lock, I don't remember the wording exactly.
---
Saw two charging a wall breach at Whitesprings golf course that danced with the assaultrons.
---
My theory is, all the toxic people decided they hated the game before they ever really tried it. 
---
Agreed, will be adopting the same strategy in future.
---
Simple. Don't use at close range. 8 mini explosions are very effective at moderate range. If you have marsupial, you can safely jump high enough to put you out of range of the explosions even if firing straight down.
---
Unless it’s level 50 t-51 power armor, I’m well over 100 hours and I still haven’t found a complete set! That right arm is elusive!
---
If it's not Explosive, it's hard to sell. Caps are increasing in value, the more TSEs are duped. Everything else that can be traded can be duped, except Caps. 
---
Three

....... 
---
..... sexy
---
.....ents
---
Becouse everyone have frame isues, crash and stucked healtbar of queen for no fucking reason. Selfish noobs
---
That's just called armor
---
One time I got a guy to turn on his mic by writing it out in the small letters on a wall in my camp. 
---
....they really need to add an emote
---
Also a great way to get ultracite if you need it, there are a lot of or deposits, great source of meat to I'd you wanna stock pile it.
---
I will waste both my time and everyone els's,  I see them sweaty dudes crowding around the clubhouse while i'm in the silo, that nukes goin to the watch tower or to the  space station. I got a list of spots I gotta hit, and if you start crowding, i'll just check some more off.
---
Seven nukes yesterday, only hit whitesprings once because some one asked directly, otherwise it would have landed at some random souls doorstep.  It's a waste of supplies and cards but jesus I can see them foaming at the mouth for whitesprings.
---
Raides.
---
Supposedly less than 1% spawn rate.
---
Thank you so much. I will be buying the game within the next few weeks. 
---
Sounds about right from my experience
---
Not sure if it's either scattered among all pellets or it's that single one, but the stats of a tse are double than a just explosive 
---
What they said.
---
The systems of the game allow that player to make a structure with turrets at the listed location. They also allow them to put in workbenches and lock everything up.
---
They also allow you to destroy those structures by whatever means you deem appropriate.
---
No one is the asshole here, just people playing the game within the mechanical means it affords you.
---
Cheers.
---
Ah good to know. Thanks for the info!
---
I hope it was the same guy. That’ll be weird.
---
It's definitely the lame way, but at the same time this *seems* like such an easy thing to fix if it wasn't intended behavior.  Maybe it's just such a low priority that no one has scheduled it yet.
---
[http://omgrawr.net/quote/1654](http://omgrawr.net/quote/1654)
---
I see it all the time in Charleston, near the red bridge by the station. 
---
I've only run into it once outside of there. 
---
Are you looking for Plan: Hospital Bed? I’m currently at Camden Park and the vendor here is selling 3 copies of it. 
---
Is junkies/20% really viable? I was just talking with my buddy the other day about how impractical it seems, even with weapons supporting it. We couldn't figure out how it would make much sense.
---
100% agree with you on the rebalance risk, so far I haven't dipped below 4 extra level ups in reserve. I suspect that a rebalance is on its way. Maybe not soon, but I am almost certain one will happen due to the TSE duping and DLC additions.
---
I's say sneaking is more scary, as you tiptoe in silence, eerie landscape, silence AND SUDDENTLY THEN A MUTATED PERSON RUNS TOWARDS YOU GROANING MANICLY, HANDS WAVING IRRADICALLY AND IT IS NOT ALONE!  
---
I cannot play holotapes in peace, as there might be something lurking just outside my view (and playing them later in safe place is not the same experience storyvise.  
---
damn I hate jump scares :D
---
I am! are you on Xbox?
---
Depends on what do you have
---
I found a tse prime .50 cal, tse black powder pistol, and some other stuff at the whitesprings vendor who sells gold today...I'm pretty sure it was all duped though, there were two identical *** instigating grognak's axes there. I bought the .50 cal and black powder pistol without thinking but I'll probably end up giving it away to somebody
---
I was genuinely curious if the level 46 trading next door was the one that owned all this crap. I was tempted to ask, too
---
I want to add lining to it though. Give me my Ballistic Weave Mk V!
---
Or as they call it in Appalachia: Camp McClintock Weave Mk V!
---
PSA Make sure you don't end up with multiple of the same pieces on the same frame, as you can lose them forever that way.
---
Oh no, I’m on PC..sorry =(
---
Questing is the slowest way to level in the game 
---
That's pretty much my luck, too. Only explosive weapons I've got are a level 5 pump shotty and a level 35 10mm pistol. The level 5 shotty does more damage at any range than the 10mm did. My modded hammer is still my go to. 
---
There's more than one? Thought only one spawned. 
---
Im away atm. But i can get bsck 2 you in a couple of days
---
i'm also looking for friends who can play weekdays 7pm EST or all day weekends, but i don't want to put my GT on here because the last time i did (not for 76)(, i got 7709742964208 adds and it was way too much haha. 30 year old woman here. reply or PM for GT - OP, i'll give you an add later on and i'll PM my GT.
---
Forge a new world order with the raiders
---
&gt; if I were you I'd just make a new toon for heavy weapons and transfer it over. Even if you never get around to leveling that toon, at least you'll know you've got an OP and awesome weapon waiting for you.
---
Ill have you know "Heavy Weapons" reached level 10 last week when i created him and played him for the one and only hour of his life.... before not playing him like you said i wouldn't even though you were talking to that other guy........He will one day level up and impress his other brother... Mule....who i also stopped leveling up... :D
---
Where?
---
In fact, as new mysteries are discovered, the dress has been known to create ruffles where once there were none.
---
Okay👍
---
I don't lock anything because 95% of the time I'm not at my camp. If somebody happens to stop by and want my purified water or crops, go right ahead friend
---
That’s alright, thanks for telling me the location! I’ll make sure to go here to get this on Xbox :) 
---
i respect that. it is very fun to roleplay as a raider and they have rose
---
Free states (if they added a little more lore about them).
---
Holy crap, lol.
---
In a few months the game will have 5 stars legendaries and the META will be something else. Then something similar will happen and the game will need another patch. It's not like we're supposed to kill SBQ forever, they embraced the MMO business model and the journey has just began
---
I'd like a spreadsheet of what junk is used for what. I want to go through and sell / drop all the junk that I won't be using. 
---
yet it wasn't showing higher stats than a normal arm that I already had with BoS....maybe the arm I already had was a heavy as i was level 50 and it just didn't list it due to legendary (mutants)
---
The only thing I'm interested in buying is the recipes for mutation serums, and I've posted numerous times but no luck. 
---
I'm pretty sure you still get the mutations if your drink the serum with starched genes equipped. I bought 6 serums last night and I don't remember unequipping it when I took them.
---
We're getting to the point where this acronym should be explained in the banner of the sub.  (No offense to OP, it's being used universally without explanation.)
---
Me too, what I’m hoping is they learn that perhaps crap isn’t the best option. I would be fine with a couple bucks more for some quality items in the box. I feel like they need more high quality items in general when merchandising games and films.
---
sweet thanks.  at lower levels it was definitely the fastest consistent method, but has definitely slowed down past level 30.
---
Thanks yo.
---
I am in this same boat. Feel free to take all the stuffs. It'll come back in a few minutes
---
I found a nuke once too and thought it has something to do with launching nukes, so I didn't touch any wire. I couldn't find any information about the random nukes either so I left it alone. 
---
Strange story to say the least. Basically a bunch of improbabilities rolled all in one. To clarify you are claiming he killed you out of pvp?
---
Please know that we appreciate you having the courage to respond.
---
But it’s disheartening in this specific instance here, because it feels like “maybe, finally, just now, possibly someone somewhere may hear about it and look into it”. When this critical issue has been obvious *from day one*.
---
Above all else, please suggest that Bethesda clearly and specifically address each point we raise, instead of existing in silence. “I’ll pass it along” is great, but “we know about specific issues X, Y &amp; Z and are working on it” would be 100 times improved.
---
Both are still working, the FC stash and the FC Regen.
---
I think I’ve seen 1 explosive weapon of the 100+ legendary weapons and armor I’ve farmed
---
I ran into a Ms. nanny that wanted to tell me a bedtime story.  It was interesting.
---
 Run hide run. LOL, I'm no help but that's what I did when I was doing that nonsense in the late 20s. Now I just spawn at the mine and go in to get my sweet Ultracite.
---
 Wait till it get quieter before trying to spawn. You really should be able to spawn at the Vault though, no matter what. Hot key your stimpacks and radaway if you can.
---
I was coming here to type Raider but it definitely looks like im not the only one. 
---
Someone's gotta reform the raider army with Rose ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Enclave here, why isn't your video feed working?
---
As a melee player i try to help out the new players at the overseer camp by dropping all this ammo i literally do not use and will just throw away when i see bambi start to show up out of the vault. 
---
(except for that one caliber i do use) 
---
In progress. 
---
Yes, you are.
---
Near Flatwoods I found an Eyebot playimg flute music trailed by nonhostile Radrats. When I realized it was a Pied Piper reference I started laughing.
---
For my defense I didn't play the game for a month
---
*sees another scorchbeast in the distance* I *would* like a nice egg in this trying time
---
If anyone doesn't want to watch the 3:20 video it basically says.
---
"If you move your C.A.M.P. module about your spawn point changes so move it about until you're spawning where you want"
---
I've had this issue and this solved it for me, too.
---
i philosophically agree with them the most tbh, and they were right about everything. i just dont like the mire. might be worth it to hear robot vendors shit on federal taxation
---
You could, like, you know, just take another picture or two.   I dunno....maybe?
---
I haven’t even seen ten beavers in my life 
---
I really tried. I stopped mining gold and silver for sale and just used acid for gunpowder, but aluminum was still a problem. Even grabbing the acid workshop first was not even close to enough. 
---
I dont "rescrap" the acid, just bulking it for the extra 5 is good enough. Still feels wrong.
---
No problem! Hope that you can get it soon =)
---
omg i'd be shitting my pants!
---
I mean...I waited and listened to them for a while and eventually one asked the other "What do you think about killing the humans" and turned hostile...so...they tried to kill me first
---
Once you can add lining to the vault suit you can add like +2 to a bunch of stats.
---
No, they don’t 
---
Why bother just take one gun army for your heavy weapons?
---
Its because your IP address has changed since the launcher process was last opened on your PC. Exit the launcher from the notification area or task manager and relaunch it. Log in to the launcher and then you are good to go.
---
I'm forced to remove high-level pieces before I can collect, even if I rezzed the frame myself. I don't want those filling my stash so I have to wait 60 seconds.
---
&gt; Melee weapons are stupid OP right out the vault
---
Except rippers which are apparently designed to give your enemy a mild massage and light haircut.
---
Everything else is much more expensive to craft than leather. Metal and Raider will burn through screws and steel. Combat and Marine need big piles of plastic and rubber. Still workable but you need to farm a lot.
---
One thing I'll add is that you can unlock every mod by scrapping minimum level arms. You never need to make the more expensive leg and torso pieces, except to check what you actually unlocked.
---
I just run around in a clown costume killing things with a hammer.  Level 131 now
---
A living human being, BUT to keep with the theme of no living people (something that i actually like for the theme of the game) they talk to you via radio or terminal.
---
So basically Rose, except instead of "surprise, im a robot", it's "yeah im NOWHERE near you but we can communicate so i'll help out."
---
I adore this idea.
---
Thank you, im gonna relog and hopefully see if im able to spawn at the vault 
---
Seems weird to me that if there's no room to land and you cripple their wings they'll still fly .....

Brotherhood is my filosofy

It's literally called the Bloody Mess Perk lol. Before trashing something you saw. Fact check.

the % chance is better and it applies to each pellet. :shrug:

Every time ive taken one its been upwards of 35 caps and i end up losing it to a dc so i either server hop to get the resources or have to retake the damn thing for another 35+

"Sorry and have a refund" even better

---
The West Tek are was really cool. Not only the visuals but also the background infos you could find.
---
I think the mining HQ should have a bunch of demolished benches and chairs as scenery, along with a note from the power armor development staff that says "Goddamn it! Just disable the ability to sit down for now. We'll fix it in version 2."
---
I would love if this disaster of a game was wiped away as a simulation and vault experiment gone horridly wrong.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/OopsDidntMeanTo/comments/acab26/now_they_know_he_can_sing/?st=JQIE2PMP&amp;sh=3729b17c

Definitely worth it, especially when you have in power armor and the medic pump. Since the explosions do hurt you also.
---
Sane but mine said “ Im coming right back for it”

They're SO FUCKIN FAT.

I think equitable go to Mirelurk Queens.

Sounds like a quote from Westworld
---
well, that would be one way to rebalance the economy if they ever fix the duping problem: we wake up from the simulation to discover that we are all level 1 characters in party hats back in the vault.  
---
They could also retcon the entire premise of the game, and when we leave the vault this second time the world is filled with NPC's and has a proper Fallout main quest etc etc etc :)
---
I didn't see it change though? Also, he actually bought the item I was selling him? Meh maybe I just am getting too old and missed it.
---
\*Shrug\* I'll find another weapon. Not too big a deal either way.
---
And Frosty, no I did not record this. I wouldn't post it if I did, as it's against the no-witchunting rule.
---
Yes, and also traced OP's IP and ddosed them right before sending over an Eastern European hitman
---
i think the dialog was bugged or something cause i heard that line from one and they continued on in the loop. maybe i needed to be closer or interact with them before the loop starts.
---
Raiders cuz Preston Garvey is only 200 years away gotta prepare..
---
I actually like the fact that I can play a holotape and listen while I am still doing something. I spent a lot of my time in previous games staring at a NPC and choosing responses. They both serve their purpose, but I like it. Also adds to the environment of the game, entering a world where everyone is gone, wondering why, figuring out the pieces bit by bit, encountering other vault dwellers doing the same. It's like a mystery that is slowly being unraveled. Each step of the way I am like "ahh, that's so cool, and so sad" as I learn more and more.
---
Right now at the obstacle course and just listened to the interview with the Senator. The backstory feels so much more 'alive' than in previous games. They certainly upped their voice work in this one.
---
I have a  regular automatic combat rifle dealing 52 damage and always try to carry over 500rds. Just clearing out Harper's ferry of lvl 48+ super mutants will cost me a few hundred rds. The hardened dbl shotty is the only other weapon I have that does substantial damage enough to make it worth using. 
---
So here’s the thing. 
---
&gt; was the camp designed to prevent others from gaining the exp, if yes, then you are not the asshole 
---
&gt; however if the camp was designed to assist others, as mine is, then yes you are in fact an asshole. 
---
&lt; the way I set my camp up is to ensure there are a few turrets to reduce the speed at which ghouls charge players so they can hit all of them and get the most experience out of it. Sometimes it will occasionally kill too many but at least the player is alive and doesn’t have to use as many stimpacks to get away from a horde for 20 or so ghouls. 
---
Those Atom Cats and Military paintjobs are actually already in the game files, too. The question is are they gonna make the smart choice and make them available in-game, or the dumb choice and toss another item onto the growing pile of overpriced Atom Shop bullshit...
---
If I see a scorchbeast, I now head for the nearest workshop and take it over, build a bed and sleep til Scorchy kills all the mobs for me and I get free plans.  Then I crouch down and hide til Scorchy finds a new friend and drag my ass home with all the junk in the building to boot.  We are becoming friends me and Scorchy, I have used her to clear out high-level mobs in places I shouldn't be in yet too.  Shee is a bit like the Minecraft Creeper, she's misunderstood and just trying to help.
---
The Skyrim Engine
---
I rationalize it in game that the plastic is of inferior quality and the acid too strong, so the melted plastic is added to the volume of acid goop.  This little cheat is about as far as I take it though. 
---
That would be a really strange way to add value to extra levels. If Bethesda were to make new unique perk animations then those should trigger regardless of perk level. "Scrapping" redundant perk cards for "card scraps", then redeeming some number of these scraps for a new card makes the most sense to me.
---
Also there is a seperate, fundamental problem with multi-level perks: they should be fully tractable. It is nonsense that I have Thru-Hiker rank 3, but I cannot toggle it down to rank 2 or rank 1. I should not have to spend 6 levels (and clutter up my Agility card list) in order to do this.
---
I gave up trying to figure it out.  Couldn't get them to start and stop on that timer thingy.  Pfft.
---
Then they would end up getting a bounty in which I would kill them
---
Agree with you on that - one of the major pain points in the game with regard to legendaries at the moment is if you happen to not get a shot on one and get no loot instanced. I'd err on the side of always having loot for the player.
---
People don’t see the exact same lists at the same vendor. I was playing with a friend who was looking for the Advanced Power Connector plans, and we were at the Sunnytop station when I saw them. I told him, he looked and said the vendor bot didn’t have them. I ended up selling him a Bobby pin for 400 caps, then buying the plans for him and trading them back to him. 
---
yeah, may have been a glitch, last I used combat armor was some....2-3 weeks ago
---
Maybe
---
My character is a greaser, and would for sure be part of the Appalachian atom cats if they existed. He scavenges the wastes hunting for power armour and hair gel to keep his hair in place. He shouldn't of gotten into the vault in the first place, but the overseer had a secret crush on him and so he was allowed in with all the other "squares" as he would often call them. 
---
Now that everyone's left the vault he has decided to follow wherever those country roads take him and builds a small cabin on a hillside somewhere where he sit and play banjo as the sun sets in the distance
---
I found them in t3 safes in the mire
---
if you're lucky you can find interesting plans, I've already seen someone get a jetpack plan for t-51b 
---
i was about to type them in, but they dont have a vendor so i dont think they will be a full faction  
---
plus i doubt being one would lock you out from the other factions, who is to say a free states or responder couldnt moonlight as a mistress of mystery...
---
&gt; +160 carry capacity (with room for another calibrated shock)
---
How did you get that?
---
Works for me, thanks.
---
Enclave or raiders 
---
Unintentional anachronism, multiple discovery, plagiarism, or retroactive continuity. Take your pick.
---
Which perk?
---
Military is on the Atom Store already but I know what you mean
---
Wtf you mean ? English not native language, sorry
---
Yessss, more people that agree 😩👌
---
Im so bored of Fissure Prime and Whitesprings.. There are so many cool locations and creatures in this game. 
---
It's people like you who appreciate it, which makes me think hey maybe I should keep helping the community out. Its the people who run away when I'm trying to help them out that frustrate me, but some of them probably don't even know I just dropped three legendaries at their level, with a mother load of Stimpacks...
---
Enclave! Aka orbital strikers!
---
But anyways ad victoriam my friend
---
Well it's better than accidentally damaging that guy and losing hundreds of caps because he killed yiu. 
---
Oh it just keeps getting better :-)
---
That's awesome.  Love it.
---
Really stupid
---
Can't even care. I'm drowning in them. I wind up dumping huge numbers of cores near stations or needlessly using my gatling laser to burn them up. 
---
It's kind of weird. The fusion core situation in this game seems to be split between barely scraping by, and oversaturated. Many locations have predictable core spawns, and so many later game enemies drop them that you can sustainably use full PA if you want to. 
---
If you only use PA for nuke zones, the imbalance becomes silly. 
---
Eyed Piper Bot!
---
I think they need to seriously lower the explosive damage before anything else.
---
I have an (just) explosive fletchette harpoon gun, with 0 heavy gun perks I can oneshot pretty much everything short of a scorchbeast.
---
Nuka colas give caps.
---
If it's a max level TSE shotgun, you honestly don't even need shotgun perks and it'll still oneshot pretty much every non-legendary non-scorchbeast enemy in the game. You could keep your rifle build and just have that shotgun in your back pocket as an insurance policy.
---
Hello yes this is dog
---
you're crazy 
---
I have a decent amount and I've been wondering the same as well! 
---
They reminded me of Oblivion npcs chatting.
---
It's a female only look.
---
FREE STATES FOREVER
---
Lame
---
do the Mayor for a day quest, by hiding behind the elevator (only 1 or  2 Gutsy will take pot shots at you), and then Watoga is peaceful
---
It's good to be bad.
---
Dropped a tse harpoon gun and two shot shot gun to someone today. Do that with most of my random spare weapons while I hunt for the elusive tse handmade or complete my weapon weight reduction set. Only need a chest now. 80% weapon weight reduction means I can carry a lot of random weapons. My current loadout is 9 weapons with a combined weight of 33. Including grenades. 
---
I launched a nuke solo with a sneak sniper build around level 45. It helped I had a set of power armor for some parts though. 
---
Ancestor of Dogmeat
---
Nope.
---
cool design but i hate the color scheme. That light blue... just takes away the serious tone of being an enclave soldier.
---
I don't dupe and I have one. I did not buy it from anyone.
---
Yup, that is what i meant. 
---
My character is a brotherhood of steel engineer who suffers PTSD after being the only survivor of a massacre of his comrades by the Enclave. He now roams the Appalachia with his flamer chainsaw and cuts every Enclave member he comes across (especially high ranking officers) into pieces.  [https://imgur.com/a/ShDf6Y2](https://imgur.com/a/ShDf6Y2) 
---
Ad Victorium! At least they aren't nearly the xenophobic asshats they are in FO4.
---
I still joined them in 4. 
---
Super Mutants were made on the west coast, well after our timetable.
---
I'm sorry, you wanted some thought or planning in this hackjob FO4 survival port?
---
That's really too bad.
---
(I enjoy this game. But damn were they lazy with the enemies and the lore continuity.)
---
These violent delights have violent ends...
---
Also very fitting for fo76
---
Lots of good info in this thread
---
PH level is the amount of water in a person's body, also philosophy is spelled philosophy, it's a joke you missed two PH's in your spelling lol
---
Oh god no. I mean, it’s ok, but it runs terrible and has bugs. I would wait if i were you. 
---
What a rollercoaster of a story.
---
My go to is Mountainside B&amp;B, just follow the tracks north a bit 
---
They already have vendors at white springs
---
I have the quest to craft Excavator, but cant. Still dont have a Plan for the PA Rack itself, and the Craft option is greyed out at public racks. Not sure why.
---
They can be worth it but prepare yourself for some disappointing results. Some of the maps are also bugged because you can't dig the treasure up.
---
If you're looking to shed weight before heading into a blast zone I suggest dumping all your armor and putting on a hazmat suit before climbing into your PA. You won't get the benefits of the hazmat suit while your'e stomping around, but if you need to pop out of your PA to take care of something at a workbench you'll be protected from the elements while you do it.
---
Use RADX Diluted, I don't think it suppresses mutations. 
---
Hopefully they just make locations on the map that players take over similar to workshops but with less pvp and with out the taking over from other players until they leave the server... ie first come first serve. 
---
Was it added today? I've checked the shop pretty much every day since launch looking for new paintjobs and haven't seen it.
---
These god damn Scorchbeasts would keep shooting their projectile waves at me endlessly! I’m nearly deaf because they shoot those waves at me too much. Suggestion: make the fight more unique and interesting, like having the beast frequently land on high places, constantly trying to surround you with it’s scorched. Make the fight more tactical.
---
Thank you  lol, hope you have a nice evening 
---
I got explosive'd to the face. It took maybe 2-3 shots, I think it was a combat shotgun, probably TSE. Easily can kill a non-PA wearing player even through the 'not in pvp' debuff. He did get a murder bounty. 
---
No!!!!
---
Came from discussion with [RogueKitsune](https://www.reddit.com/user/RogueKitsune) in reddit thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acbekg/give\_some\_amount\_of\_exp\_to\_all\_players\_in\_a\_party/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acbekg/give_some_amount_of_exp_to_all_players_in_a_party/)
---
I have yet to take the "Lead Belly" perk but I have 7, 2 animated 5 normal. So at some point I hope they implement something so I can get rid of them....
---
If you enjoy survival adventure games this is the best out there.
---
Rust, ark, the forest, whatever else are nothing compared to this.
---
Not on xbox or ps4 ;(
---
(Mainly played 76, didn't really enjoy playing the precursors and thus never finished)
---
You know how in the previous games you had options available to you based on how much stats you had allocated in your special? That would be pretty need here. Or even just having that Demolitions expert card would make it so that the true option would be highlighted.
---
That'd be neat.
---
I see why you might say that but then lvl 2s in a hazmat could sit at a nuked whitesprings and wait until all the gouls were killed by high lvl people and then go loot and get a ton of stuff that they did nothing to earn.
---
...what?
---
You don't think they wanted to kill players because they were killing players?
---
Think about that for a sec...
---
There are definitely mixed opinions out there. Personally I say yes! Bought it at same price a week ago and I dont regret it. 
---
I’m sure people are just scared or have been attacked in the past. 
---
Uhh... okay? What are clout goggles? Where were they found? Why is this significant? 
---
Details, damn you!
---
I think there is a bug that is affecting food and water consumption rates.  Mine is fine, but I watched a buddy play and he burned through food and water like crazy despite no disease, chems, etc.
---
I notice I get something similar with fusion cores from time to time - insane drops for no specific reason.  I wonder if it has something to do with the AP extended run bug.
---
Yes!!
---
?? Sorry if I'm confused, but what are clout Googles??
---
Hitting google (translated from Scottish as clout means to hit something) isn't something you'd find. 
---
I'm confused.
---
Last night i travel around to find the "treasures". I had 8 maps. Mostly i got 1 armor piece or 1 weapon, some ammo, trinkets and drugs. Actually nothing special.
---
Same with my 2nd Account last week with 10 maps. As i remeber i got 2-3 useless legendary stuff. In the end it was a deficit in credits because the fast travel costs.
---
It's pretty rare to find one, unless someone else left it in a bag. Normally you buy them off a duper. Prices crashed recently so you won't need that many caps.
---
It’s a fashion thing in the us
---
only game i've played that people will call me a troll for using a weapon i found in game to do pve content. Youtubers are getting called the blight of the gaming community people are getting called sheeple for not liking a bad game. this is one of the worst gaming communities i've ever been apart of. 
---
You can. You just have to place the roof on afterwards. 
---
Being fucking SURE you never have to move that shit again. Same for decontamination arches. Otherwise you'll literally have to deconstruct half your CAMP. 
---
The level of that PA does change from high to low level. More often it’s lower though. 
---
You have to have 9 charisma to share a level 3 card right?
---
you dont always get the opportunity. sometimes things happen fast, sometimes its just not a recreatable shot. its a minor inconvenience but it was upsetting logging into another machine thinking all my photos were wiped. we also have a multixbox setup for group play. its kind of crappy that if they take a dope picture while we're playing that they can't take it home with them
---
Some world objects will automatically disappear when building over them
---
How is it an exploit? He says he doesn’t mean cancel the animation and have the gun be loaded. Seems more like for when you want to switch to a melee weapon or another loaded weapon in the middle of a fight. 
---
Do you have enough time to escape if you cut the wrong wire?
---
I know that feeling.
---
Except my house took 5+ hours to build and everything including the decon arch got destroyed.
---
The guy was a level 32 made off with a bounty of 900 or so, and was one-shotting level 140s.
---
Worst thing is when I tried to repair my whole base the game crashed to desktop.  In fact my house is apparently too complicated for the game to handle so I can never repair it altogether; I have to essentially rebuild piece by piece.  Can’t move my camp either or it’d CTD again.
---
So I get my stuff destroyed by a level 32 griefer and I get punished by having to spend all my resources again, and I didn’t even get a chance to at least try to get the bounty because the game crashed on me.
---
Going to try a before after with grounded serum to see what happens and report back. Any damage I get from them from sonic blasts deals against my health and not rad damage like when they do the crop dusting. If was explosive damage like Ive seen mentioned a couple times, I wouldnt be lasting very long in battles with them. Unless its super weak explosive damage. But, we'll see tonight hopefully when I find the serum. 
---
The hazmat suit is about 1 rad/s in a nuke zone 
---
I figured it was probably random 
---
Damn assholes 😂
---
Just started a melee character and played that for 10 days.
---
A number of common item can be scrapped for acid, I have not had to farm it, but there are a number of workshops that provide it and places where you cam camp and put a an extractor on an acid pool to farm.  Check out one of the interactive maps for locations.
---
Is there a range on it? 
---
I'm a sniper while my friend is melee; wondering if it'd be worthwhile to use this.
---
I’ve found a dead civil war re-enactor as well as two robots who seemed to be stuck in a conversation loop
---
Ad Victorium bitches
---
I’ve noticed that, was wondering if there was more. Thanks
---
The change your appearance option can be accessed from the menu when your looking at the map. Not sure what the button is on PC or XBOX but PS4 you hit L1 and the menu opens and the option is there before quitting the game.
---
I’ve crashed less than 5 times total since beta. Xbox 1. 
---
It is for Bethesda
---
I think this would solve the problem. Then simply remove all tse weapons or at least have a way to remove the second effect so they all become just two shot or just explosive. 
---
There's established software out there for real world stations to play a list of songs and not ensure no song is played a certain number of times or within a certain timespan from others.  Not sure why they don't do something like that.
---
As does Arktos Pharma.
---
I made a post about needing more unisex outfits. You can try the "duster" looks like Preston Garveys outfit... somewhat close to the cowboy look on a male
---
Oh ballistic weave. I miss you so. 
---
I didnt know the trade thing was automatic?? The shimmer ive been able to avoid by hiding in bushes.  Ive noticed some people can target me, others cant.  Interesting, thanks for the info!
---
You get a lot of plans from them. Forest treasure maps aren't worth doing though as they seem to only drop common plans.
---
here's a list of things i got from doing them:[https://i.imgur.com/sm1SMvx.png](https://i.imgur.com/sm1SMvx.png)
---
Not going to lie to you - it still has gameplay issues, exploits and (at times) terrible server connections 
---
But it’s also fun being part of what started as trainwreck and seeing it slowly coming along 
---
Awesome! Thank you
---
I've recently cleared the 270 carry weight limit and now using power armor does not grant me a carry weight bonus. For example, I can carry 270 weight, but when I equip power armor, it drops to 245. Happens to my buddy as well when he hit the 250 mark. We're both on ps4
---
I was gonna just game out the hunter outfit I think since i can't get that one on male I have 1400 atoms tho just laying around haha 
---
Show proof or this is bullshit.  
---
Me and my buddy tried this last time someone claimed this happened and guess what.   Noone could take shit out of power armor if placed down.  
---
Sold it all 3 weeks ago thanks
---
I like the loneliness. To me, it makes it more realistic. I wouldn't argue if they added MPCs but for now, it makes the game a bit more creepy. 
---
I believe it was a known thing if placed on a power station, but I don't think it can be done anywhere else.
---
&gt;It was buggy, it was laggy, and yes it was incomplete
---
&gt;I seriously don't understand the hate for this game
---
That's some heavy fuckin' cognitive dissonance there brah.
---
Try it yourself. Other players can as of now , take your armor right off the frame.
---
you too huh? lmao . I make it a point to shoot him in the face especially if its pre-war money
---
Nah, it’s been there every time I’ve looked. It’s at the bottom of the paints section. It’s a military camo skin
---
You are the hero we need right now.
---
Ugh, tell me about it. I’ve been stuck in Whitespring for a while now because every direction I walk in has level 50+ enemies ready to take away 30% of my health with a single hit.
---
Im only level 13 right now. 
---
Shoot his nuke from a distance, very entertaining!  If you can headshot him you will be able to loot his nuke.
---
My favorite one is "Hm, seems to be growing well" after i've harvested every single plant from their CAMP
---
Where is this area? Dont think I've seen it yet.
---
Try it , have him place it down and you go into the frame inventory and pull it off , it works
---
So I just tested and reloaded my shotgun and was able to switch mid-reload to my guitar sword cancelled out the reload but cut the animation. Same from shotgun to .50 Cal. Maybe it's is a problem with specific weapons?
---
If you're having the issue with the lever action, they're fixing that animation soon so it might be related.
---
Why would you do that to yourself
---
I sold mine. 
---
Didn't realize you could upgrade. 
---
Found some poor sap may have made the same error and instantly rebought. 
---
Yup. I did this with some friends on my second character, went from level 20 to 50 in a single nuke. If you're gonna do this, try to get a team together, even if it's just random people on the server, so you can benefit from Inspirational for that 15% more xp.
---
Wow this is good. I had several pieces in my stash thanks!
---
Actually he's not saying he doesn't want to cancel the reload animation and not have the reload complete. We're both working off assumptions and mine addresses the imbalance of allowing reload to happen still if you cancel the animation.
---
you can't solo this event? 
---
Yes I’m aware, but I’m trying to make 10,000 .556 rounds or so a week and my base is already on a iron mine. Extractors are pretty slow now.
---
It can , it works anywhere. Dead serious.
---
;3
---
&gt;Like others have pointed out, multiple levels of the same perk card can be useful. 
---
This is true for perks that have levels, but I get irrationally angry seeing 3 god damned Woodchucker cards in my deck. The game should have been programmed to check for one star cards and eliminate them from the perk pack loot tables once you've acquired them.
---
Prime receivers for weapons, rare structures for camp, ultracite ammo
---
Crafting serums, shielded linings, prime receivers and Ultracite ammo.
---
I see your point in this - but I expect it would be less of a problem then the current issue of missing loot completely if another player decides to take out legendaries on their own. This seems to be a common pain point for folks in nuke zones and when in groups.
---
I guess the way I see it - this would allow for less negative interference between players ("stealing legendary loot" etc.) and more collaboration.
---
Honestly, if you are having consistent (even once or twice a week) server disconnect issues you need to stop playing this game until Bethesda addresses it. Obviously, this is my opinion, but this is what I have done.
---
If players that experience this issue keep trying to login and eventually get in, Bethesda sees people playing the game and its all about numbers for them. I see comments where people are making multiple attempts (10-15 min) to get in and still play. Kudos to you, but honestly I think it doesn't put any pressure on Bethesda to fix it. If Bethesda sees the player base drop this should start fires on their end.
---
I hope Bethesda can fix this issue as I do really want to play this game, but I won't play it until the server disconnects and, 'controls temporarily disabled', issues are addressed.
---
In one of the fallouts I looted an unexploded suicider and his nuke was a special type that looked like a football.  FO3 or Vegas.
---
Shielded under armor 
---
Or just hit the enemy 
---
I always hate trying to transcribe in game noises, but "BLAAAAAAAAAH!" is too perfect. 
---
The issue is the decon shower.  Repair that normally FIRST then you should be able to repair the whole base.  I had this happen when a scorched gulper decided to snack on my base a while back.  Kept crashing to desktop any time I tried to repair my base.  However I repaired the shower then did the repair all and it worked like a charm.  
---
Why do so many people down vote anything having to do with Camps?
---
Seconded. Blackbird is beautiful on all of them, but that vulture face paint on the X-01 is something else. 
---
well, I mean, no one that was in the vault was a member of the bomb squad so, not a surprise we don't have insight to disarming bombs.
---
It's easy to make something go boom, not so easy to ensure something doesn't
---
Yeah, you're right, this is dumb.
---
In the meantime, don't bother repairing your armor unless it has really solid legendary effects. Just make new armor.
---
Think of the first line of the song...
---
*Almost heaven,* West Virginia...
---
If this is true its a bigger problem than duping, its actual stealing
---
Its a nuke, so you cope with it as well as you would cope with a fatman.
---
PC, forgot to add on the post :P
---
I've seen the two Mr handy talking encounter like 3 times but never this one.  :(
---
When I tried it with my buddy , it wasn’t on a frame.
---
was re-watching the link and I gotta say man...
---
I fucking love this game dude.
---
I remember being dubious as I didn't really like playing the other games (never finished but kinda know how they end) so I didn't buy 76.
---
However, a friend bought the Tricentennial Edition (I think?) and gave us a friend code for the BETA for me and my S.O. and we got HOOKED.
---
And then he and a friend bought the game for us on release day (I didn't have money at the time).
---
I've invested hundreds of hours already and can easily say it is in my top 3 favorite games of all time .
---
You're just being dramatic 
---
I have two characters. A brother and his younger sister. Both child prodigys born from an Anchorage war hero and a Vault-Tec engineer. The father had died while sabotaging Chinese artillary guns. Devastated, the mother did everything in her power to prepare to protect and prepare her children for anything, so she got them a spot in 76.
---
Austyn, the older brother, believes in order and the will of the greater good like his father. He believes in doing what is right and protecting who he can when he can. He hates mutants of any kind and see's humans as pure, sacred and something to be protected. These convictions have placed him firmly in support of The Brotherhold of Steel, but he see's The Enclave as a temporary necessary evil. He is extremely intelligent and uses overwhelming fire power to bring justice to West Virginia (Power armor Explosives and Heavy Weapons). He can wipe out hordes of enemies in an instant with his modified harpoon gun, .50 Cal Machine gun, and when he needs to, brings out his beloved Punisher (2-shot mini nuke launcher). Austyn will often work in teams and will help out fellow vault dwellers as he comes across them in the wasteland.
---
Annie is more like her mother. She is cunning and talented at most everything she does. She is a survivor, and will support whoever proves to be the most powerful faction, and has decided that The Enclave is the only way to salvation while seeing the Brotherhood as weak. She has augmented herself with mutations through serums as well as using chemicals/drugs to improve her performance on the battlefield (marsupial, speed demon, adrenal reaction, and the +crit +perception mutation). She utilizes VATs with extreme deadly precision and is practically undetectable to most of her victims. She usually works alone.
---
Although they do not often cross paths with one another, they still love each other like siblings should, despite their fundamental and philosophical differences
---
I dont agree with this. However, when it comes to a nuke zone, if you dont tag a legendary glowing one in any way, there should always be Hardened/Glowing Mass and/or High Fluids regardless. There are a ton of people in the zones and enemies never seem to spawn when Im there and always miss out on the flux crafting stuff. Legendary weapons would be nice, but they should be voided if you dont tag them. Just the other flux related things.
---
Yeah. It is
---
I really like the idea of nuking other locations to spawn different bosses. 
---
A+ my dude.
---
Oh *that* one. That's not the Military paint I'm talking about, I meant the olive drab one from FO4 that was shown in the E3 gameplay.
---
lvl 15 here, a couple of days ago I loaded in and my camp was just outside the edge of a Nuke zone. I saw that and went 'yes! lets check it out!', got about 30 feet and died. No radiation suit or anything.
---
Not the brightest vault dweller, unsure how I was selected for vault 76....
---
I see it all over, you can't be looking to hard.
---
Another annoying thing, to me at least, is that arranging my active perk cards is a waste of time... I spent a good 10 minutes arranging all my active perks in descending order from highest number to lowest number. The next time I checked my perks, they were all rearranged again. This really bothers my OCD tendencies. 
---
I bought this game for $80 and dont regret a single cent of that purchase.
---
Somehow I didn't see a slowdown when I was leveling, I also waited till 50 to do 75%+ of the main &amp; main-side quests. I just explored, crafted, and did nuked whitesprings a few of times enough for 6 levels). 
---
Meh, throw in Wallace and he would calm them both down with his *SOOTHING VOICE*. Then all three of them can go take down the Enclave.
---
Take your outfit off and visually check. It's probably heavy and you didn't know. I thought my level 3 chameleon leg was at most sturdy, but it's heavy. 
---
Yup, Honestly for guns primary effects should include things like: explosive, two shot, incindiary, etc.  basically things that just flat increase the damage to all targets, secondary should be things that are 'situational' like 'damage to scorched' or 'damage to animals' and teritary should be your 'utility' effects, like +x special, 'vampirism' and suppression
---
Two Shot Explosive weapons aren't a glitch. 
---
At the edges of the map there are a couple hiding, I found one having a bath in a pond.  There is also a troop of 5 wandering around fighting with Vertibirds since the last patch.  I found them at the shooting range.
---
Is there a good story? And at least moderately easy to figure out what to do when you start? Hate survival games that give you 0 direction at the beginning 
---
I’d rather not have the plot twist to prey all over again. It feels like such a cheap twist. Like a ‘it’s a dream along’.
---
I’ve never been bothered by the tranquility lane loungers or the memory den. Operation Anchorage was actually really good aswell. Just this huge theory really just unnerves me because knowing Beth’s recent track record. Sadly it may become bloody true 😂😢
---
Abraxo, bags of chlorine, I think snallygasters drop acid (maybe in more ways than one).
---
For campers/extractors:

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/?st=JPAVIYXC&amp;sh=f13b5e38
---
no, anyone who puts turrets there deserves to get their camp leveled to matchwood
---
i posted complaining about this when people will still figuring out how whitesprings worked and got downvoted to a bolivian. im glad more people are realizing how annoying it is, ESPECIALLY when people are cooperating to respawn the club house so you have everyone waiting outside by the bus when they spawn in and start dying to turrets
---
What makes a person deserve loot from a mob they didn’t help kill?
---
Actually, you can get 4 stars, the n\*4 is a mod atm.  
---
atm means at the moment.
---
I never knew that. I knew about locking extractors, but not doors. Thanks for the info friend. 
---
Pray to Todd
---
Use vats targeting to destroy the spouts (it also appears to be her weak spot as she seems to take more damage).  Then she can't spray you anymore...  Also the spray used to be even worse before they nerfed her damage output.
---
They are doing it to afk(from the camp) farm mobs that other players kill/train
---
Boy, that E3 footage sure has a stable framerate when firing an automatic weapon...
---
same, dude. 
---
I've had multiple people try to do this and tried to do it multiple times myself to my friends and not once has it worked.
---
Show proof or stop lying.
---
You might have something odd set in voice chat. Maybe it is set to 'Team' and you're not on a team. I've had that before.
---
It becomes disarmed and you get some caps and loot (nuclear material, circuitry, aluminum)
---
I have over 400 hours in the game, I refuse to believe that.
---
The amount of swapping I have to do for lockpicking, hacking, crafting weapons, repairing weapons, crafting armour, crafting weapons, and diluting radaway/stimpacks is downright absurd. 
---
And, of course, 90% of the goddamn time I'm fighting something big with fucking Chemist instead of First Aid. I *always* forget to switch it back.
---
Mine won't let me put multiples of anything on one frame. I can only have like 1 right arm, 1 torso, etc.
---
Do the prime receivers actually make a difference. Because I have a TSE Combat Shotgun and the first and only time (so far) that Ive beaten the Queen, I got a Prime Receiver for a Combat Shotty. Does the added bonus to scorchbeast damage make a difference?
---
Rare CAMP structures???!!!
---
Yeah that freaks me out too for the same reason.
---
Yes, it's a bug.  Had that happen to me last night (PS4) and I wasn't wanted.  Had to exit the game and log back in.  Everything was then aback to normal.
---
I want the serums so bad, so friggen expensive though.
---
Did they have screws? Plus a deathclaw drops likes 3-5 black titanium each so that went pretty quick
---
well, with combat armor I tend to put 'ultra light' on it as that can lower the weight of it to the point that it's like having deep pocketed, but means I don't loose cary weight by putting on my x0-1 if I need it for an SB fight (cause sb are only barely tollerable  to fight in pa due to the stagger res and limb dmg reduction it seems to have)
---
Yes, but you can get better reward if you wait until like lvl 50-60 since I think the reward kind of is roughly the same with your level 
---
How is that a bigger problem than duping? Duping is a hack, game breaking move. Stealing is reality. Any different than visiting someone's base and taking crops, water, or resources? 
---
Why go though all the hassle every time you encounter a lock? Like every 2 minutes...
---
Whats that for and where to get it? And what does that do?
---
If you have people to play with that will extend the life of this game. Otherwise if you're just starting out you're going to be dealing with griefers, bugs, random disconnects, sometimes infuriating game design, and bugs.
---
I'm always looking for new people to play with. I'm usually on most nights, and just launched my first nuke yesterday! GT: Mr Bibby
---
The only solution i can think of is getting the white knight perk. All armor repair now only need 1 ballistic fiber and last way longer.
---
atleast post a screenshot mate
---
Because without a rifle/shotgun build outside of glowing enemies there's nothing else I want or need in Perception, at all 
---
I met the arguing Mr. Handies
---
That’s true it does make it more creepy which is one of the best things about fallout games but I also like doing quests for humans and rescuing them. It’s not so much walking around that’s lonely, it’s that there so little dialogue besides with a few robots. I guess I’m just missing the RPG of it all 
---
I did for a while, and then realized how mich of a waste it is to leave 3 perk points tied up in something like Lockpicking, when it could be used for Ghoulish or Lead Belly.
---
Depends on where you live. Some places it's "shoulda" and sometimes that's proceeded with "done".
---
Maybe u/lonevaultwanderer has some input?
---
Large power pylons are part of the advanced power connectors plan 
---
That was proven to be bullshit also.  
---
If you hit down the the d-pad while you're on the 76 application in your menu there's community forums you can join as well as party's with open invites.
---
It was worth 60 if you ask me
---
Oh my bad, they really just need to add more. It only makes sense
---
Yeah I cut the wrong wire once and the explosion was underwhelming at best
---
Power armor mods. 
---
I’ll be a fat man in a little coat rolling doobies in a van down by the river 🤣
---
Yeah, but what are the percentages for shadowed? And do they vary between light, sturdy, and heavy?
---
I suspect it's not so much a glitch or exploit as bad UI and user error. Which is why people are unable to "reproduce it", because there's nothing to reproduce, it's just the way UI works. 
---
You open trade. The guy requests your weapon. And you price it for 100 caps or whatever, thinking you're selling plans or something, when in fact you're selling your weapon. Because the UI is total dogshit, it's unclear what is happening. 
---
Wait, what?  My understanding of PVP in FO76 was that if any player shoots at you (and kills you?) and you don't retaliate or engage them in any way, then they get WANTED status and others can hunt them for a bounty (though it sounds like the bounty ends up only being 10 caps?).  
---
Anyway, others have told me that if you claimed a workshop, then if another player comes to your workshop and contests you for it, they can openly engage you in PVP while in the workshop without penalty- and I guess if you PVP and win you get a bunch of caps?  
---
But are you saying if they take over a workshop I had claimed, and then see me across the map, they can follow me and kill me without being wanted?  Because if that's the case then it sounds like claiming a workshop is essentially switching to open PVP mode anywhere, which was not what I thought it was.  
---
Lol where the hell are all these dev/time estimates coming from? I've been writing software my whole life and I definitely could not even begin to estimate the number of man hours to solve a problem into which I have zero insight, on a codebase I've never seen.
---
agree
---
You got your 80 caps worth of fun yeah. Ordinance is worthless.
---
Yea I’ll be going at it solo no pc friends for me
---
I know this does not help your current situation but if you're trying to approach that Cavern you need to come from the Eastern edge of the map down and then run across the big open area to the cave door. Once inside the only thing you'll have to deal with it a handful of scorched that follow you in.
---
Yeah but they fly and attack slower. \*shrug\* Not really any thing they can do about it. If they make it land and it doesn't have enough room then it will get stuck and have a higher chance of bugging under ground when it switches to the ground attack animations. 
---
Nope
---
This ... 
---
I think prime receivers have highest base damage increase AND they do bonus damage to schorched/scorch beasts
---
After reading this, I like your idea much, much better re: tractable multi-level perks. 
---
Card scraps was kinda what I meant above. Animation was about turning cards gold like the last one outta the pack, not new animations. Sorry if I wasn't clear on that
---
If you take the photo with photo mode in-game, you can then view the photo, hide menu, hit the xbox button, then Y for screenshot.
---
You may not have it as a loading screen, but at least it will be tied to your GT.
---
If you're too high a level they won't spawn
---
Thank you, right now i just wanna get as far away from this place but im spawn killed every single time
---
On the golf course greens and sometimes in the clubhouse 
---
After playing last night with a low level fried I'm almost certain that your theory is right. Normally I just 1 shot the ghouls, but since he was only level 15 or so I was running around with my Mr Handy Blade so that he would have time to tag everything before I sliced them apart. 
---
Two nights ago when I was solo I got shit for legendary items, but last night I ended up with dozens of things. I had to go to bed before I had a chance to sort, so I don't know if anything was worthwhile, but the sheer quantity of items I received makes me believe you're right.
---
If I have heavy PA pieces in my stash, can I take those out, transfer them to an empty frame, then wait for the frame to hit my inventory and put it back in my stash or am I just fucked at this point? 
---
Lvl 50 ** Chameleon Armor L arm w/ +1 Agility and
---
Lvl 50 ** Chameleon Combat Armor Chest w/ +1 Perception
---
If you are interested. Chameleon pieces stack by 20% so you at least 2, preferably 3+
---
I have gone fk it, they can have it, I'll come back tomorrow :P
---
Only the lvl 9 ghouls wearing golf gear are considered golf ghouls. If they are respawning as 62s it won't work
---
Yup, i would like a Duel to be epic like a star wars lightsaber Duel ( Duel of the fates ) ,,, but instead we get this one shot happy slap deal.
---
PvP should always be skill based. 
---
I think PvP Dmg needs an overhaul and Stims need a cooldown ( perhaps ) according to the strength of the stimpack in PvP. 
---
And the ability to set up our favorite hot keys like fallout 4 did.
---
The souls games are the definition of polished and almost 99% glitch free
---
Ditto here but I had a lvl 60+ guy take me to the golf course and he was trying to help me lvl up quick.  You know, take pot shots at enemy and hide while he destroys them, so instead of being your lvl I’m at 32 now, but that wasn’t how I wanted my experience to go, won’t be doing that again.
---
I never said they couldn't,  knowledge of the game is what differentiates a "noob" from a "vet".    A "vet" wouldn't pull their PA apart to store individual pieces.  A "vet" would not encourage low levels to horde armor that is useless to them and easily obtainable.  I understand some people may be collectors but op was directing this at "noobs" and again there is no reason to stash away PA pieces you are unable to use.
---
Thanks, good idea.  Is there a trick to auto use rad away?  I find it super difficult to switch over to the menu while getting wrecked by high level ghouls.  Playing on Xbox
---
Why not ask right here??
---
I made several team mates through reddit.
---
Im level 68, and i usually offer a trip to Whitespring for low/mid levels to get acquainted with possibly the best location in the game. I offer this because of the high level ghoul mobs that dwell in the area. Its  great trading and farming location.
---
Im going in now, add me if you want.
---
paulofg1980
---
I've run it twice and the first time it did this.
---
Stick to the forest for a while. 
---
I'd say lack of barter UI from Bethesda is what killed barter economy. We can drop items. We can sell items. But we cannot barter (trade) items. 
---
Chally The Moo Moo uses Rollout, you dead
---
I am pretty sure you need 2, 1 for each leg.
---
With pvp I mean a fair fight, not spray and pray and the one who gets hit first dies.
---
See, I wanna get into PvP, so obliterating others is important to me
---
Is it to lure enemies to a specific point.... in front of your turrets? Would be cool. 
---
Youll need 2
---
Speaking of Harper's Ferry, if you follow the road N/NE of town there's often a high level Hermit Crab hanging out on the bridge. Usually just a Glowing one, but last night I bumped into a 3 star.
---
Yeah, would be cool if there was a narrow fitting combat helmet to go with it... 
---
PC? and how much? 
---
He means Fashionable Glasses everybody
---
There are some clothes you can wear under your armor (like the vault suit) that you can modify like armor.  The mods add SPECIAL stats and a small amount of resists.  The different colored flux are used to upgrade different factions' underarmor (cobalt for the vault suit, red for the enclave suit, etc), and each underarmor has different stats.
---
IIRC you get the underarmor suits and the mod recipes by completing the factions' quest chains, and from vendorbots.
---
I’ve given up completely on claiming workshops. I really like this game but the crashes are inexcusable. I’m going to go pick up a copy of red dead redemption tonight. You can always count on rockstar to make fantastic games. 
---
This whole deal is a massive pain in the ass.
---
Server hop until you get a fresh server and they may show up in the club and there's a few that can spawn on the greens to the north and west of the guest houses.
---
Contrary to what some say, they do appear at higher levels, but you have to be the first one to spawn them on a fresh server. I've had them at level 115+ 
---
Never worked for me just more  trolls
---
His name would be Hodd Toward, and he'd say "It just works!" And then I would shoot him in the face with a Two-Shot Explosive shotgun, and watch as Bloody Mess triggers and disintegrates him. 
---
"getting"
---
I can’t post a screenshot
---
No.  Whats the point of a loot shooter then?
---
Might as well ask to buy guns/gear in the atom shop
---
Don’t forget the time traveller on the railway tracks
---
There should be multiple build trees. A damage one, a crafting one, etc. 
---
As it is now, if you're on pc use the Perk loadout mod. One button and I can swap to my lockingpicking / scrapping / whatever perk set. No more "hold on...let me swap."
---
&gt;you can't one shot a hermit crab
---
My Instigating War Drum with +40% power attack says otherwise.
---
Oooh I just did. I like that idea!!
---
I think you'd be much better for with a base on an acid extractor, using excavator armor for iron and lead ores in mines.
---
I collected over 500 lead scrap in less than an hour in Lucky Hole mine last night.
---
Yeah, I wouldn't mind all situational perks, that don't have passives of course, to be "0" points. After all, most would swap to something like picklock just to pick a single lock; and immediately switch right back. It's as if it's already active anyways. This would just remove the annoyance. That or give them passives like what gunsmith has where not only can you craft higher tier items, but you also have increased weapon durability as a passive when the card is equipped. 
---
+100 for full set, one calibrated shock leg (+50), and the +2 str on the chest.
---
I’ve seen videos of people crashing on PC to though 
---
You can get away with only having level 2 of red sponge. I have a charisma of 4, but I use magnetic personality to give me a bump enough to be able to share rad sponge. I'll have to check out the ghoulish perk, that seems like a nice combo
---
OK cool. Cuz I have the Hardened Receiver now, when I go to equip the Prime its the same damage...just added bonus to beasts and the Ultracite Shells, which Im not fond of.
---
They're not listed afaik.  Maybe some values from fo4 would be accurate.  The mods don't vary between armor weights but the weight of your armor affects stealth.
---
If I am wrong and we are talking about the shotgun itself you can change attachments to make it weightless, or add inventory weight with some [Grilled\_radstag](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Grilled_radstag).
---
This. It's a game changer.
---
I used it for a few days then i scrapped it. I kept the hat though.
---
A REAL woman
---
I’ll try that. Wednesday night is going to be “Fallout: sims”
---
Been awhile since i did that quest but yes he did die.  I think she found him dead or couldnt help him in time or something.
---
Idk there are plenty of people with miles carrying tens of thousands. Idk personally as mine is lightweight but it’s not troubling everyone AFAIK
---
PC?
---
100% agree.
---
Is it me or is anyone having a hard time fiding royal jelly.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Yes agreed meant killing legendaries too quickly for loot to be instanced for a given player. That's a good point regarding loot being instanced if anyone tags in a group - that does help mitigate this issue. I actually was thinking this was not the case - but in hindsight I believe you are right on that.
---
Only thing I can suggest is to server hop. 
---
Well without a video we have no reason to believe this.
---
i’ll look from there then, thanks
---
I hope so too I have two pick lock cards for example. 
---
Nope PS4 :(
---
I'm not sure if you're aware, but there are different factions when it comes to cap currency at a vendor. So if you were to go to the correct vendor's, I believe you can obtain like 1400 caps per day.
---
I completed the whole story and literally had no idea underarmor existed...
---
That's pretty cool!
---
Your answer is more correct, just wanted to put something basic as a response, some people have no idea about acidity or alkalinity lmao
---
It should work with any starred enemy. I got the majority of the points I needed for that quest by running Uranium Fever, which tends to spawn 1-2 stars rather than 3 star.
---
Replace TSE with dupers
---
Ive been trying, everytime i die i cant see players on the map either
---
Some of the really rare plans will easily sell for thousands of caps on the trading subs. 
---
I suppose there could be any number of simulations and we ended up in one more accurate to what actually occurred.
---
Many things would likely happen with some frequency--remnants of us gov and military forming new groups. It's the same general environment so evolutionary adaption may be similar. There were likely other species, or other members of the same species who underwent radioactive mutations but these proved a disadvantage in post nuclear world. 
---
The enclave could have been a measure put in place before the bombs by US intelligence agencies. 
---
But yeah, if does require some implausible narrative leaps. 
---
That's very star trek
---
Best solution would be to either stash the stuff you don’t want to lose upon death or place your camp and use them. 
---
If you mean:
---
Can't see shit, spammed by screen shake and nailing through stims is fun...
---
Then hell yeah it is!
---
I'm 120 and I've only seen 1 lol
---
if you’re on pc you can change them from the .ini settings. but yeah, it would make things easier to customize if the settings were in game, especially for console players
---
Stop duping them then.
---
Quick question am using Excavator Power armor that is level 25. I am currently 53 and am wondering should I build a new set first or wait a little bit for me to level up first for better armor. What should I do.
---
Yeah, I learned this after buying a new xbox. 
---
I just started playing this week so I can’t exactly comment on the story yet 
---
There are tutorials in pop up menus and plenty of handholding up to the moment you leave the vault. Some gameplay mechanics are built into the main quest line in a tutorial like manner. 
---
From that point on however it’s really hard to wrap the head around how to navigate the other game features 
---
The controls on PC are counter intuitive (think the controls are console focused) and as such navigating menus as Well as building menu is very clunky to use. If you are on console though, you will feel right at home 
---
Last night I killed a 3 star glowing one and was rewarded with a 1 star  level 35 furious golf club. I would have almost preferred a ghoul slaying gamma gun.
---
That’s the same with me I compared it to the normal death tambo to check if it wasn’t my audio I hope they fix it because the audio for the tambo makes one of my favourite weapons.
---
Glad you wasted your money.
---
Honestly I've no problem with the demo perk, as, outside legendaries, explosive ammo is quite heavy, requiring a dedicated boomyboi to also run around with ordinance express
---
Yeah same
---
Pipe revolver? Wonder if they will ever add the .308 receiver that was in FO4.
---
googles, not goggles
---
The shielded raider underarmor mod adds 3 per, 3 agi and 1 luck to raider leathers. Other types of underarmors provide other stats.
---
This doesn't imply that they will further increase by 200.
---
They need to go further than 200 IMO.  I want the next increase to be up to 1200.
---
To add to the other person: shotguns are super effective because with vats crit builds, *each pellet in the shot counts* toward proc’ing your crit bar. A lot of people don’t realize that.
---
Those are the same people running around with two-shot shotguns thinking they’re bad-ass, without reading they do nothing. The “extra shot” is just an extra pellet.
---
Use the right tool for the right job.
---
As an fyi being overweight with tonnes of junk makes things more crashy.
---
I rarely crash personally but the second i come close to being overburdened i stash at a train station or camp.
---
Totally! I've got those 2 and I rarely need to repair my shit.
---
you can get like 200 from sylvie &amp; sons logging camp [https://youtu.be/EKxzCGigkKA](https://youtu.be/EKxzCGigkKA)
---
Fantastic! Thank you!!
---
I'd be interested if you are pc
---
I think in the whitesprings, I remember seeing the gasmask with googles spawn there in the bathroom stalls. The regular gas mask is usually in the lower level areas 
---
I k ow different vendors have their own caps, but I've only found responder, raider and I think the one brotherhood vendor. So I only get access to about 600 a day at best.
---
I hooked them to pressure plates by my front door and placed the speakers on my third floor to use as a doorbell if someone came in. No terminal needed.
---
I have had this issue lately as well. Scortchedbeasts not landing, and their primary attack has no cooldown. It's just an endless wave of radiation blasts and damage. It also makes it so hard to see the thing, that I can't land a shot. 
---
Ugh. Sorry, I was just loading in and would have ran interference/killed them for you. 
---
Okay then. Im wrong.
---
would pay to see OP buy it again.
---
Ah, so it is. I didn’t even notice, but that just brings further questions. 
---
Yeah they seem pretty rare
---
Where did I say I dupe, can you read?
---
I take it that the little kids started their weekend already?
---
[This should help](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aa3n8x/we_are_creating_a_where_do_i_get_that_list_of_all/)
---
Whatever will we do now that the truth is out???????
---
I tend to crash when i talk with a vendor. not all the time but sometimes.  
---
Thank you though, is still very kind, ive holed up and managed to hide in the big metal shed
---
That's what bugs me most about it.  Lack of balance in general aside, it seems designed to encourage griefing.  Maybe they envisioned players grouping up and claiming camps, then having lengthy, exciting battles with other groups to hold onto them.  What they got was a meta based around super short time-to-kill, bases being blown up for funsies, and players luring others to their death for quick caps.
---
They didn't even offer a way to fully opt out of it, with pacifist players still having to heal or relocate if another player is chipping away at their health.  A situation that was designed as part of the experience.
---
I remember DayZ being touted as a sort of experiment to see how people would react in a post apocalyptic survival scenario.  Like there was going to be complex interactions between players, and not just players murdering everyone on sight for cans of beans.
---
So far the only PvEvP setup I've enjoyed is Division's Survival mode.  Still makes use of a large, open map, but equalizes everyone at the start, and has more going on than a simple deathmatch or battle royale.
---
The other option for Bethesda on the something else META is to raise the weapon level cap. 
---
Endgamers will all be chasing lvl 75 or whatever stuff, and the existing trash filters down to lower level peeps.
---
Keeps every level of player grinding.
---
Why would you assume they aren't just trying to farm junk/caps from people coming to collect bounty?
---
Different people like different aspects of PvP.
---
Of course!
---
uhmm, does swing speed even affect the buzzblade?..  just curious here, since you hold it in place, or does it just make it damage faster?
---
I can see that. But I really enjoy walking into a dead town. It's just creepy and ripe for jump scares.
---
Friends are food
---
Fact: This is an opinion (The game indeed has several problems, though)
---
Switch Rose's event to being a small bunker she found under/near the top of the world, and they are all great ideas!
---
Tried that and it worked.
---
The picklock perk shuffle is tedious :(  I often just skip it.
---
So prob, I think it's ~400 caps
---
That is a handy tip. I never would have thought of that. 
---
I was in desperate need of ballistic fibre once, and the only reliable place I knew to get it was Camp McClintock, but a player had done the same thing: he set up his CAMP just outside the gates and re-looted the place every time it reset. 
---
* **Stash:** Maximum stash storage has been increased by 50%, to 600 pounds. This is a conservative adjustment, and we plan to increase the storage cap further in the future once we’ve verified this change does not impact the stability of the game.
---
After the 1st Dec. Patch, they replied that it was successful and stable and would implement the remaining 50% at another date.
---
Can't hype up class freak enough. I have about 10 mutations and little to no noticeable downsides 
---
Yeah I know it's a weak point but she spams that acid every chance she gets so I duck in and out of cover
---
I build up into those towers usually, might borrow that spot for myself and build up above it lol
---
You can only go to 7 different vendors (8 if you include Grahm) a day, even though there are 22 total vendors in the game, due to the stupid ass connection to factions. Not too mention, they're seperated really far apart from one another, except for the two in Watoga, but it's a hike just to sell shit in this game. 
---
My solution - Seperate all vendors into 22 unique vendors with their owns cap stashes, inventories and values. Then have raise the max cap stash to 500. (I dont mind a cap on vendor caps, its just too little right now and an even smaller options to sell from). And finally, when you sell something to a vendor, dont depreciate the value of our item being sold to put more caps back into the vendors cap stash.
---
That SIZZLE-POP-CRACKLE thing you hear when high level players are just melting stuff that would sponge all of your ammo to kill is TSE.
---
Was the maze the same one I saw posted with a 1k cap prize for finishing?
---
Yes! That one as well!
---
Yeah that's what I usually do if he is near enemies I will shoot the nuke but ice only seen one
---
The trick is to have 6 points in int for the sole purpose of having Fix It Good and Power Patcher (the pa reduced repair cost).. its such a pain keeping 6 points in int though
---
One time I was following a thing for a quest, I think the sword of the mistress thing, and I don’t realize the area had much higher level things than me. I first found a green gas ravine thing that had a scorch beast, died like 5 times, then level 50 ghouls, while I’m level 15... died a few more times
---
Honestly it’s a dying game now due to the duping.
---
 Really? I did not know that was possible. I have a good idea whats going on and have under armor but have ignored the main and really most quests. 
---
 I have been playing Fallout for a long time. ;)
---
Mine is either the flickering, which is just a game restart.  Or a complete loss of sound. Used to think it was from other stuff running (open browser windows) but had nothing open other day and cut out twice in a row. 🤷🏻‍♂️ if it’s not one, it’s the other.
---
I think the cause (I had read somewhere on here) was from the shadow distance setting. But I have no idea what to do with it.
---
I dug through everything I could find in that questline and don’t recall a specific mention of his death. I kind of assumed it, but if someone found something specific I’d be interested to know for sure. 
---
These are awesome and sound like tons of fun 
---
Responders!
---
I never get anything, pisses me off. I almost want to launch my nukes at like 3am when I hope fewer people are on. Even though it wont work either.
---
I heard about that before I think i saw one in 4.
---
YES, THIS EXACTLY. This is what I was trying to get across in my original post!
---
I wondered if they were a nod to the old Omegle chat on the internet where you tried to figure out if it was a robot or person, the dialogue seemed similar to that.
---
so only high level can repair their gear? How about limiting regular armor to the mats needed when creating them? 
---
OOOOOOR you remove the roof, place the shower on the floor and add the roof afterwards. 
---
What console u on ? Or pc?
---
Bingo! I have overdrive servos on the other leg, I still haven't got the second calibrated shock.
---
The resists are only like 5 points, and the extra stats are helpful but not really game-changing since they don't grant extra slots for perks.  I go with the underarmor that grants strength just for the extra carry weight.
---
What makes you think they wont?
---
My friends and I ran across this pied piper about a week ago
---
I found a nanny who made me listen to a fairy tale.
---
I'd be happy to get the weapons from New Vegas, as well as the Zetan weapons from Mothership Zeta.
---
I do miss the All American; it'd give me something to do with all my 5mm.
---
There's no way to automatically use them, but I put Radaway, Diluted RadX, and RadShield into my radial menu for quick access during nuke runs. 
---
If your build allows it, put a point into Rad Sponge once it's unlocked at level 35ish, and then find a teammate to share it with. Even with only one point in the perk I almost never have to use radaway because it procs often enough to keep you from getting to irradiated.
---
Fact: Bears eat beets.

“Thanks. I just had them stuffed.”

I am on PC and was unaware o could change it in the files. But yeah, my brother, on xbox,  is just out of luck.

---
They bought the serums initially then duplicated them in mass, and began selling them.  As more people did this, they began undercutting each other so that their serums would be bought over someone elses.  Some even set up "packages" where you could get all the serums and some other stuff for actual money.
---
They wattered down the market.  It's something that happens at some point in pretty much every MMO and isn't fixable without either rolling back servers, banning the dupers, &amp;/or fixing the exploits that allow dupping and adding new content that makes all the previously "best" stuff irrelevant.  None of those are real likely to happen here though, or at least not fast enough to matter; actually, the roll back is pretty much off the table at this point, unless they can target only the duplictaed items and even then it's going to result in a lot of outrage, since people have bought those duplicated items(some using actual money).
---
No kidding.  It was "getting" out of control on day 1 of launch...
---
On the one hand, swapping is a pain (though it's made less so with the mod that gives you perk loadouts). On the other hand, there really is never anything that compelling in locked containers/rooms that I would feel like I'm missing out by not picking the lock.
---
Are you using borderless windowed mode? I got really regular stuttering until I went into fullscreen mode, and have read that enhanced pointer precision in Windows 10 can cause it in borderless.
---
I'm on PS4
---
You basically set your camp up in a zone, and then take one signal every time you go out.
---
Yeah, I didn't mean it would be a good idea to add those things. I know players would hate it. But I would still shamelessly buy stuff like that 😂 Then I guess the lamp doesn't light up. It's in a building with power. 3 power &amp; only 2 ceiling lights so there's 1 left over. Hmm, maybe it takes more than one power.
---
It might just be our builds. The screech spam was annoying when it hit me, because it knocked me off balance, but while sprinting I was able to avoid it. 
---
I don't have issues with them landing, though. Once they land, I typically don't give them a chance to take flight again. 
---
It also helps to not just fast travel to each vendor. Actually walk to each one and fight whatever pops up, even if you've explored a location. The caps seem to come a lot faster to me this way.
---
“Screw everybody else”
---
You are free to move servers at any time. I wonder. Does it feel good to be salty and whine like a little girl on reddit?
---
Did u find a fix for this? This just happened to me last night
---
I don't have any of that, but play the game however you want.  
---
With the good comes the bad, deal with it or don't.
---
Same experience but on ps4.
---
I played yesterday for close to 8 hours in two sessions with no problems.
---
Anyt exclusive atomic item you personally purchased cannot be traded nor crafting then giving. And dropping it will just bring up a popup notification that it will be destroyed once dropped.
---
What's the problem with claiming the workshop and building a generator with free resources?
---
How can you be the President General of the Enclave when *I'm* the real President General?!
---
yea sounds like an amazing thing for the portable defense-tower type camps
---
It's pretty useless in my experience. Short range, repeatedly fires on one spot, large budget expense. 
---
It's frustrating low level, but not really after you unlock everything. There's 7 vendor pools at 200 caps a day. Responders, Raiders, Whitesprings, Whitesprings Bunker, Harpers Ferry, Watoga, and Watoga Train station, are all of the separate pools. I sell chems/other aid items, bulk scrap, and crap legendaries, and make that 1400 a day easy. Consider it something you have to work towards?
---
my bad sorry about that it was PC, wasn't thinking
---
Mats?
---
I want that dark red paint job!
---
Bethesda, please ignore ;)
---
It’s a fresh install of windows so literally nothing going on in the background. As for my CPU, it runs pretty much everything else fine. 
---
It’s just incredibly odd behavior because my frame rate is mostly fine.
---
It's just weird that only skyrim and fallout games are flooded with bugs. I could diss Ubisoft and their open world games but they look perfect on a techinal level compared to bethesda
---
Any of you go to a vendor you haven't been to yet that day and had the vendor have 0 caps? I went to the whitespring yesterday as I was in the area after not being there yet that day, and the vendor at the whitespring station had 0 caps as well as the vendors inside the hotel (although I think those are all connected) then ran into Graham right outside the whitespring, also 0 caps.
---
I believe some of the combos you're looking for on the shotgun aren't available.

If you're on pc you could just set up a key to lower the spotify volume.

That as an aside, I always turn music off in games. Wonder how alone I am in that.

If we create an account on the community forums whats the possibility of our information being sent to random people?   
---
....asking for a friend. 
---
Bro I mean what is special bout this dude?FFS why do people even post this kind of shit.
---
"Wow today i got my excavator PA"
---
"Oh yea I got my first tse weapon"
---
This shit is like not important and nobody cares that you acomplished something.
---
XB1, sorry brother

Im drowning in water lol
---
You were logged as using a third party software that is automatically detected in your running processes. These can be completely benign or cam be used to cheat with. You might have had autohotkey for something for your system or cheat engine running running in the background. One thing is for sure. The game logged something running that it didn't like.
---
Did you receive a ban or a warning yet?
---
this one wins
---
It’s everywhere until you’re trying to build a set believe me 
---
I use a perk loadout mod found on nexus. Make it easy to do that. 
---
I am going to nuke it again later, was great, I like it better than the golf course, was spread out, covers many areas including interiors and the airport
---
They're pervs, and we're all falling for it and adding naked pics to their library every day. Wake up sheeple! 😉
---
Jesus that fast 
---
Congrats. I'm still working mine. Got like one arm left. Set up my camp in the middle of the ash region to get some black titanium ore...just need to find some acid now.
---
Naw, it's for softening up the target location.
---
don't you love it when everyone on the subreddit just agrees with you?
---
Unfortunately I did see radtoads once.  I've also come across ferals, bloodbugs, mirelurk spawn, and liberators a little to the north.
---
Dude, you just saved me over 100lbs in my stash! Inventory management has been so rough to get used to in this game, (just hit lvl 25) I’m finding my stash and personal inventory get maxed out constantly. 
---
LOL. I had a Legendary Super Mutant show up at Harper's Ferry as I was doing business and he got away. They show up pretty regularly and I kite em' out to the road and Black Powder Pistol them to death. 
---
 This one I chipped down to 30% or so and he ran. I killed every damn Mutie in the place and did not find him ;( 
---
 Oh ... no! You keep what you kill!
---
I don't know what level those perks are available at.  I do know that you will replace all that gear.  While leveling up you can easily just replace gear with newer stuff that isn't damage.  Eventually you can grab those perks and make it dirt cheap when you have some 45-50 legendary stuff you want to keep.
---
You can also just craft new stuff if you have the mats.  I don't know why it takes ballistic fiber but it was't really an issue personally.
---
Same for me, spec wise I can do the best quality, but that is barely playable, going about medium fixes most issues though I still disconnect or crash 3-4 times per day. 
---
Oh okay. Someone posted on the 76 bazaar sub that he built a maze and was giving a cap prize for the first to finish it on PS4. I was surprised to see people saying it was actually really hard and no one had claimed the prize yet. 
---
Stats don't change because it only works when you aim the weapon. Doedn't matter if you have a scope or iron sight, it works with anything as long as you aim and not shoot hip fire. I tested it at 3 stars and you have to be pretty far to see any difference. Like really really far.
---
i havent put the effort into looking myself but there should be options to change the color values in numbers so you’ll probably have to do a bit research of how the red green and blue’s numbers should be to get the color you want
---
?
---
Fallout 76 uses the method to check on automation and scripting. If it senses that you are pressing keys at too regular an interval and too quickly it will throw that warning and see what you do. If you continue with the key presses then you are logged.
---
I wasn’t really impressed with the Pip-Boy from Fallout 4’s CE, especially when a Bluetooth one with a screen was released within a year. The helmet in this one was better than I thought it’d be, but I guess my expectations were low after that. I like the map and figures. I didn’t even realize the nylon bag was different than the one advertised, but that’s probably because I don’t use carrying bags much so I was more getting the CE for the helmet. At any rate, I get two bags now. As long as I turn my pessimism off, that’s a decent end result for me.
---
I didn't realise that you could get mods for the excavator set, also didn't really think of the extra str bonus.
---
i would like a "let me hit the legendary before you kill it asshole" emote
---
This is amazing.  And what I thought end-game would be like between DLC's.
---
I believe that receiving duplicate cards once maxed out is intended.  I was happy to see Slugger come up again once I had maxed it out so I could use my points more wisely (3 points max Slugger = 20% 2h damage).  This way I could use 1 point each in Slugger, Expert Slugger, and Master Slugger for 10% increase in damage using the same 3 points.  I have done the same thing on a few cards now giving me more options when switching things around.
---
outside of the context of FO76 this would sound very concerning
---
Yeah, same here. The first card says 10% more range and accuracy, but mine didn't change at all. I'm using a low-light scoped sniper rifle (sniper hunting rifle). I didn't see anything that indicated it only applied to iron sights.
---
Ultracite ammo is "expensive" and not really worth using. But probably worth it to stockpile them before future content is released
---
Nuke events are publicly broadcast in the the game.  If anyone is upset about party crashers, then they are naive or idiots.  
---
Eh, I don't see a problem with dupes, but I strongly believe the perk card UI/UX needs an overhaul.  Options to create "decks" of perks, organize them better, hide unwanted cards, etc.  It's a clunky and awkward UI.
---
"If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right"
---
My game has been crashing a lot lately, and building a generator costs \~10 screws. Really not a big deal, but if there's a workshop that I don't know about that already has a working set up, that would be better.
---
What do you mean by free resources btw? Is there some sort of workshop discount I don't know about?
---
I mean theres gotta be some compensation. Thats why I think those who place their CAMPS at either the Doubledoor or Pond at Whitesprings would have get the best out of it. Especially when thats also the exact spawn point for the mobs.
---
Im not the one with the busted ass character....oh and carrying thousands of pounds without glitching means you literally crawl everywhere. 
---
very true :)
---
I was happy to take a selfie with bowler hat
---
That is a bug that sometimes happens when dieing while overencumbered. It really sucks. :-/
---
I've done that before. can't remember how i fixed it.. might be right click while at the terminal? 
---
Do you happen to know if it improves VATS accuracy?
---
There is one that is ONLY available during a nuke it is at a nuke silo inside the shack where you go down the elevator. It is a sad one
---
I've had two CTD so far and I'm level 116, probably played around 130-140 hours or so.
---
I didnt post this. So please dont act like i did. Its weird. Personally idc.  I only called you out for acting like its not an issue and that you had hard work involved in clicking a button. Thats all. 
---
Patrol duty has high odds of weapon plans from each completion. Seems most efficient way to farm them past 20 at the moment. However  you can also find them in the market sometimes for 1100+ caps which isn't too bad. Some like me got the plan in 3 goes. Some 10+
---
well, as for preventing full ffa on a map, I would say reputation system and also a sparse population and a large map. I would say remove map markers for players completely. FO76 on PC has a really cool community. A lot of really freindly people. What happens if a few want to be raiders? bounties. Bounty hunters. You see? Reputation on a server and server lock will naturally lead to role playing. I would like to see legendaries removed as well. Right now this is just a legendary farm game. So you got that TSE handmade, great. And all the 3 star armor. Now what? farm some more. to get what? thats why there is respec. theres nothing else. Go try to find a TSE 50 cal. switch to heavy. And what? take down a silo. Farm some more. 
---
As for server instability, yeah, its the dupers. Thats pretty well known by now. What I am saying is, you get off one night, you get on the next, same server. you get disconnected, you come back to the same server. The charge is only if you want to jump and request it, like if you and your buddies want to be on a server together. 
---
Learn where the PA locations are and you will never run out of fusion cores. 
---
For stimpaks get the Chemist perk which lets you create double diluted stimpaks so you can make 4 diluted stimpaks from 1. if you get the Super Duper perk you have a chance to make 8 diluted stimpaks from 1. Diluted is half as effective so you can turn 1 stimpak to 4 stimpaks using this and never run out.
---
I am Viktorya. Prewar Russian spy infiltrating American Vault Tech Institution and Vault projects for nuclear fallout tech and strategem. I was deep under cover when the bombs hit, so I went into 76 with the hopes of returning to my home land with lots of information after the communists won the war. Only thing is, the wrong reds won, and now I'm out here surviving. I dont care to 'rebuild amerika', I only want to collect super powerful weapons,armor, and survival tech so I can return to my country as a war hero.
---
Wait. You have plans for the mod so you can craft multiple or you just have the mod itself? If you just have the mod itself go ahead and attach it. You don't need any crafting materials to attach mods.
---
It'd be good for targeted strikes like that, yes. 
---
But turrets are generally more useful as they target things automatically; even when you're not there. 
---
West Tec are masters of origami....that is how they fold it up to fit in you pocket!
---
Ive given up hope of ever killing the Ghoul Golfers 😞
---
Thank you! It's nice to know there are such good people playing this game. I can't play for a few days and prefer to be self sufficient for things like this, but I really do appreciate you offering.
---
That's a sad negative, the only good 3rd perks for a TSE Gatling are faster movement while aiming or 90% weight redux.
---
Encountered this anomoly the day the game came out. I was with another player and we stumbled upon it and I asked him which wire to cut. He stepped very far back and I cut the green wire and actually disarmed it. Got some nuclear material iirc.
---
Dark red on Excavator or really any other color on excavator would be sick!
---
AoE is pretty common to use on RPGS to describe the amount of damage a spell or similar should be able to do in primary stances, it is quite common knowledge.  
---
Op is mostly used in MOBAS or Shooters
---
You on PC? Someone is sharing my spot near TofW in the savage divide.
---
...yeah, speaking as someone with a vagina in real life, playing a female character who has finished the quest...I ask again. Have you finished the quest?
---
Not sure what level of “real” you are going for, but it’s going to be pretty abstract at this point.
---
and you have the answer now :D
---
It was a very common misconception especially when CAMP's budget were sooooo damn buggy
---
Ok , message if u need
---
What if the brain in the vat is just for show and he was really just nothing but an AI the whole time. 🤔
---
I'm on Xbox, level 74 or so. Gamertag is Clingy Iguana. 17yo guy.
---
As someone who has been salty from the start (collectors edition pre-order), I'm literally waiting for the game to be more stable before giving it another shot.   
---
Seeing posts from Bethesda and the community doing Bethesda's job and making paragraph reports of bugs that are still happening is still as disheartening as ever. 
---
Maybe run away and don't take on enemies that you can't deal with yet...
---
Downvoted to a Bolivian you say?  Is this some new type of racial slur that I am unaware of?

Holy shit, I've seen one of these and I thought it doesn't explode, I was so lucky to disarm the nuke.
---
My favorite one. Btw, they're doing "Waiting for Godot", if you didn't already know.
---
That's not a mini-nuke. Its a small nuke, but mini nukes can fit in your hand.
---
BoS is upgraded/modded Combat Armor, not crafted from scratch.
---
It's still garbage. I have about 250hours in, mostly to collect enough atoms for all the dumb outfits I wanted. Now everything is essentially over and there's no point in playing because it's such a snooze. 
---
This could be the most reasonable answer to the conflict.
---
Found my own answer: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a664pk/perks\_hidden\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a664pk/perks_hidden_data/) , "long shot only works with ADS, no vats" according to that thread.
---
They are additions to combat armor. Go into combat armor and it will have the plan there. 
---
If they are the underarmors they will be in underarmors.
---
Well in my defense for the  atom shop is.... I dont care about cosmetics lol the stuff on there is mostly non immersive also the Christmas emotes are kind of seasonal. I do agree the price is high for these items  and that was kind of scummy to sell something as discounted. Also I need to be clear. Publishing companies have control over when soothing gets published and are in charge of other licensing  so the nuka cola rum was a fail I mean who pays 80 dollars for rum? I mean I feel bad for people who bought it and I get it looked cool but 80 for a bottle to have as a collector's item? Who has that kind of money? Jk but yeah I'm glad I didnt pre order it maybe if had been like 19.99 I would of and at that point I would of not felt like I got robbed. The canvas bag I understand completely they had false advertised  it and well I feel like the game disnt have enough time to polish it before it was rushed between working on rage 2 and apparantly elder scrolls 6 right releasing a new fallout after 3 years unlike the time gap from elder scrolls and othe fallouts. And that was the best example  they need to get their shit together. The best thing to do is be cautious about any collectors editions. preorders and cosmetics in any game. Dont waste money on it. It's a lesson for us to be more cautious  and for them to realise they cant rush projects if they arent atleast stable

Plentiful at the phillipi battlefield cemetary along with black powder rifles and black powder pistols and a HUGE fluffy dress and a Confederate uniform and a tuxedo

[Shannon Rivers hated that!]

Sometime in January/Feb.  My bet is early Feb.  The Bethesda team said they were putting things off until after the holiday season.

Read the whole thread.

I just want the lever-action rifle reload to get fixed. It’s driving me nuts. I could hardly believe they didn’t fix it for 76. 
---
Especially with the pump-action shotgun reload working just fine.
---
I don’t know what moron downvoted me, but yes. I kill several every time I go.
---
Nice answer, go play rust. A lot of dicks for you there.
---
you can lock extractors? the fuck?

Even at level 27 I have the same issue. Usually I either pull them towards the robots and jump up on a wall or run like heck....
---
The roofs are metal on the outside isn’t that good enough
---
[deleted]
---
Your technically correct, but I was more referring to how it acted.   It acts like it's a mini-nuke, with all the same particle effects.
---
eeexactly :D
---
White knight is a must for any non PA build.  Even if you don't have the Agil to keep that 3 point perk card equipped all the time, swapping to it when repairing drops the cost to just a token 1 bf.
---
If you can leave it equipped and pair it up with 1 point of the Lucky Break, Luck perk card, you will almost never have to repair armor again.  I have not repaired anything for over 60 levels. 
---
Sounds like something a synth would say...
---
For Science!
---
Lmk if you drop another we took her down quick lol 
---
I think thats what i got, ive managed to finally escape
---
This is an interesting idea.. i've been using pocketed.  If all my armor was ultra-light.. it would even apply while i was in PA.. and i would have less need for 2 points in the reduced weight perk... going to try this =P
---
The lowest possible is the likely level 5. At least, I don't think I've seen lower level legendary items, could be wrong.
---
No you're fine, just locate a frame, deploy it, transfer the parts onto it, and let it recall to your inventory.
---
You aim to misbehave?
---
Of course yeah that makes it fun. I like that how it is in the older fallouts. Walking into a town and not knowing it’s going to be completely abandoned until you’re there. 
---
One near south-west powerstation has a water purifier.....you just need to build enough generators for 10power
---
I have a bunch of atoms saved up, I think I'll hold on to them for that paint. I'm dying to paint my X0-1 something cooler. 
---
Myself as well. So many crashes on Ps4

"i found a glitch where you charge a grenade and hit F4 and it gives you 1000 caps"

Was watching a twitch/YouTube streamer by the name of shroud and in his video shroud plays fallout 76, he came across a friendly super mutant trader by the name of grahm. He sells the plans for 252 caps and the dagger plans for 288 caps.
---
The video is called Shroud Plays Fallout 76 PC! w/ Skadoodle and Bnans #12 (November 4, 2018). The time stamp is at 1:58:38.

Bloody Mess fixes this. 
---
The disruptor is part of the "It's a Trap!" event.
---
What do you mean?
---
Have you tried it at Whitesprings since the hotfix? We've tried it twice since then and it seems like half or less ghouls respawn by logout/in compared to prior to the hotfix. But if a player who hasn't visited the golf club yet walks in then we get the full respawn. Could it also be due to excess server lag and the triggering player running inside too quickly after logging on causing only a couple of ghouls to respawn?
---
Your post helped. I could not figure out why I was dropping charisma and other points. I read the word addiction.. Never noticed that my guy looked sad, thought he was just tired of the wastland.  
---
Invisible teammates are quite annoying. Sometimes you see your teammates naked floating cause they are using power armor. Sometimes you only see their name floating in the air. And sometimes you don't see them at all and are able to walk right through them. 
---
Why do enemies gravitate towards one team member. I was higher level and even if my teammate started the fight, the moment I join in, all enemies leave my teammate and attack me.
---
Playing on XBOX One
---
Another one bites the dust!
---
We were fighting the queen and someone was playing the intro music to Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in the background. Hilarious. 
---
Light marine is just Marine with the ultra-light mod which you could also put on combat armor.
---
I'll add that I use heavy metal armor personally =P  Not a ton of energy damage flying around.
---
Price sounds right, fairly common plan at Harper's.
---
I usually play until I freeze/crash then do something else.  I end up not getting burned out on the game but it definitely gets annoying sometimes.  Sometimes I play for a few hours yet sometimes it's only for a few minutes.
---
Screw these perk cards, just give me the good old skill trees and stop with the limits at lvl 50.
---
It was a quote from Mal in Serenity where they had laser revolvers.
---
And I keep getting crap loot

I have a Furious Gatling Gun with 25% faster fire rate equipped with a speedy receiver. Absolutely chews through enemies. Oh and it’s for sale.

I prefer this one:

---
What do you need hardened mass for 
---
 300+ hours in and lv200 something (from playing/exploring not grinding/exploiting), so sorry but if you know where to look it isn't hard to find pieces you want without too much trouble.
---
Not familiar with that 
---
this is a random encounter thingy, i find this literally the first thing near the river next to the first overseer camp. of course i didnt cut the right wire and it exploded.
---
Aim, pacify, kill the mutants. Everything will be at peace... Unless pacify fails.. Then oh well. 
---
Kiting them to the robots is all I can do to be honest. I sometimes get XP and sometimes don’t. 
---
Its the perk card that mind controls other players turrets
---
Yesterday was:
---
1) Claim workbench (paying 25 caps)
---
2) Claim second workbench (another 25)
---
3) Crash
---
4) Repeat until broke or frustrated enough to quit
---
The one that finally made me quit, though, was when I *also* completed the Poseidon Power event (for the first time, solo) and started producing fusion cores.
---
As soon as I fired up the core extractor, *blue screen*
---
There's nothing quite like having a block of time to devote to the game, then spending an hour just on setup, then losing all of it. 
---
Repeatedly.
---
So, I went and played Overwatch. Which I will have to continue to do until the game crashes are fixed.
---
Still got him?
---
If it's not automatic, then yes.

They are both in the 40s, IIRC. The idea is for everyone playing to benefit, not just the ones with good gear.
---
Xp isn't shared. If he is one shotting everything he'll get all the xp.
---
Its how i doubled the level of my friends flying solo
---
By placing an artificial threshold on the amount of game knowledge needed to become a 'vet', you are gatekeeping. 
---
Tips and tricks are useful at every skill level, character level, and time investment. Sharing what we know to help others is always useful. And in context, sharing how to save stash space is indeed, "great info."
---
If you recently got into a tussle with another player or have a bounty itll trigger them 
---
Because I think there can only be one at a time per server, not forever obviously, but the presidential campaign seems to be a faction event. 
---
That’s quite a gem! Lol 😂

Known PA bug
---
Thanks for your reply. Just loaded back on a new server, and they still are hostile. So much for pacifist mode...
---
How do you store the PA and frame when not using it? It takes up a LOT of weight in the stash box and I'm pretty maxed out already
---
&gt; Dragonrend
---
What would be the solution is to allow us to ride the damn thing with a little minigame like in monster hunter while the ranged guys do their work from the ground.
---
But Dragonrend is probably what bethesda would be willing to invest here. (dev time = money)
---
Except... It still doubles the damage of each shot, even though it only adds one pellet.
---
Probably. I think they need to balance things first.
---
Also i don't see then adding more rifles for a bit. They are by far the best and most varied group.

Brotherhood Of Steel.

I mean seriously, who wouldn’t want Phoenix, the badass robot, fighting by their side?

And purifiers, just not crops. If it’s unlocked it applies a ten cap wanted level.

Ok i watched I understand, do u have any info on the laser revolver tho?

I have about 1300 atoms just by playing the game I was going to get the slaybells on the death tambo but it was removed

Crafting Endgame weapon receivers, ammo (to include orbital strike gernades) armor mods, and faction underarmor.

When I saw someone build there, my first thought was: "Why would they allow you to build so close to popular area? This is going to encourage camping even more."
---
From 1400 to 11k daily is rediculous.
---
True, but from 290 to 300+ ?
---
Or you could actually check what you’re scrapping - it does ask you to confirm it after all. 
---
Alright, I just have to be the guy to make some corrections here. 
---
1) Shotguns have tubes not clips
---
2) Shotguns shoot shells, which can be loaded with either shot or slugs.
---
They need to make it a no camp zone also same with they fucks that set up a camp to fight the queen.

Best explanation.

Half life of nuclear material creates car size explosion.. Yet gasoline and oil in a car haven't evaporated/gone bad and still explode normally. Lol

Usually I see one at the Flatwoods vendor always up for sale.

I’ve had this problem, it’s not slightly off it’s a complete 180.

Awesome, i'll be playing them when i want a break off fo76 :p

No, I am very rarely wearing PA, and never in the Forest. My build is specifically non-PA.

How dare you not show a show us a video of the explosion
---
I found one of these once! I managed to get lucky and disarm it, got a bunch of junk out of it. Don't remember which wire I cut, though.
---
Find a teammate with the radsponge perk! It will not remove mutations. (At least in my experience)
---
Wasn't that the point of your post? To educate low-level players?
---
Grab every perk that reduces weight of items and that's about it. 
---
Nope sorry, just trying to be clever /fail

This helped me at launch, maybe it will still help you now [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9zntsj/fps\_is\_all\_over\_the\_place/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9zntsj/fps_is_all_over_the_place/)

Bloodied/Instigating/Furious are all good primaries.

40% Swing Speed is the ideal secondary, special mention for 40% power attack damage on Instigating weapons.

I remember my first time in power armor and I was running a nuked white springs, looted a lot so I went to scrap all my junk, I was like dam look at all this armor I don’t need. Did not know power armor un equips my main armor. Well I learned I need to be more careful when scrapping, not go on Reddit and complain
---
Even with the upgrade, it doesn't even begin to compare real armor. I think it maxes out at 35 or 45 at level 50, and it didn't appear to show any stat changes with the Eye equipped, for me. What exactly does it change?
---
Neither of both is the case.
---
I think the thing that is hard to adjust from FO4 to FO76 is that you could wipe out vendors caps in FO4 then just sit and wait for 72 hours and do it again in like less than 5 mins. FO76 you have to travel around then wait for x amount of in game hours till they are stocked back up.
---
Great list OP, but I think the rewards should be flipped. IF you do the events once, you should get the unique outfits, camp items tied to the event  etc. but just once, with a chance to get a legendary weapon drop. Every rerun gets the chance for a random weapon drop. 
---
I think we would rather run dungeons or raids with a chance of a random 3 star drop, then a one time named legendary drop that you can never get again.
---
There's 7 and they are actually easier than you think you get too. 
---
At lvl 15 i walked to harper ferry without a hitch. Now i have 4 vendors available.
---
I might try the journey south but I'm not concerned. Handmade plans are making me plenty of caps.
---
Also there's a display bug so try selling an item if they show 0 caps.
---
Overall the caps are fine imo. Makes ppl sell to players more but we're lacking the tools to do it.
---
Do you feel accused? sorry mate but if you haven't done it you shouldn't feel like that otherwise something is itching there, and this post isn't about duped items it's a petition, so please mate, don't be a dick.

Mine is the son of a park ranger and a brilliant inventor. His mother was pregnant when the vault closed, and he was born shortly thereafter. He grew up listening to his mother teaching him the secrets to surviving in the wild. Hunting, gathering, finding water. His father taught him to be resourceful and make the most of materials at his disposal.
---
Which is why he wears a ranger hat, a surveyors outfit (I wasn't a fan of the ranger shorts), and uses a pipe sniper rifle. As a back-up, he keeps a pipe revolver (think elephant gun) and a bowie knife.
---
Good to hear. Good luck out there.

I dont think so, I look for weird stuff like and twoshot gamma, I have a mutants players gamma, it's a meme

i never use the endurance perks cuz im not a noob. what a waste of special points.. i never have an issue. i have 1 in endurance and that's for good doggy. the only thing thats makes you go through food and water fast is speed demon. even that isn't bad. food and purified water is so abundant i never have trouble, especially dog food. like get good. weapons break fast tho I'll give you that. especially laser weapons, that shiy needs to be fixed
---
Now counter argument, from experience since I was lucky enough to find such a weapon, I sit and wait there til they are below 10% or if I'm being attack up close so everyone can tag them by then, he'll I even have a mod for me to see the % left so I know when it's time to shoot.

It's a game I spent money on ofcourse I'm going to enjoy it. What's bitching and complaining more  than people have 2 months after release going to do? Duping is a problem  it's been a problem for many games  I get its even more broken in a multiplayer  game.

Daft question but have you clicked it on? The nuke lamp that I have turns on and off. Also, try moving it closer to where the power is connected in

Whats a easy way to get deep pocketing? I mostly found deep pocketing for raider armor.
---
Not sure, but have you ever leveled up from 50 to 60 in 3-5 minutes ?
---
The eye of Ra boosts all the mistress items. Bumps stealth up to 20%? or 25% harder to detect while sneaking. The blade goes up to ignoring 100% of armor and the voice can stun robots in addition to the electrical damage. With the items equipped they show up on the effects page of the pipboy.
---
I personally wouldn’t have minded chucking everything and making a much higher quality helmet.  I think most folks got it for that anyway. I nice, useful canvas bag is nice though.
---
Yeah....I’m just trolling
---
Got to troll every so often :)
---
Plans or scrapping a bunch of armor, I believe deep pocketing can only be obtained from plans but you can get normal pocketing from scrapping
---
You can hear it. It goes "thum-thump, pshhh!" 
---
Making stable flux for higher level crafting.   Use a Chemistry bench.   
---
Each the five kinds of stable flux requires 10 raw flux of the same type, high radiation fluids, glowing mass, and Hardened Mass.   All of these things are found in nuke zones.   Raw Flux comes from irradiated plants and the other ones are dropped by enemies.  Raw flux degrades over time like food so you need to make a stable one or lose them.   Stable flux does not degrade.   
---
Glowing mass and fluids are Aid items.   Hardened Mass is a junk item and breaks down into Ultracite.   Unfortunately, it's not a protected item like Beer Bottles (wtf is up with that?) so when you reflexively Scrap All after leaving a nuke zone, you've probably just scrapped all your Hardened Mass on accident.   Sad panda.   
---
Just a heads up, but that olive drab paint scheme can spawn in the world. i got 3 t51b pieces painted olive drab from the PA spawn location at the prison. 
---
When you get to the overseer's camp, going east we'll bring you to a house near a Sutton sign. This is a random encounter spawn, and one of these encounters is a dead Chinese scientist who holds a keycard that opens the storages in the intelligence bunker under mama dolce's.
---
Why not? Star Trek Online for example was a pretty shoddily put together MMO in a very short production time scale (The Klingon Empire didn't have their own quest line and were PvP only), no voice acting outside the tutorial, and was already running on an engine that was considered old in 2010, and here we are nine years later and the game is still running. 
---
It all depends on how well the game continues to sell, and how much people are willing to spend on the ATOM store. I know I've bought ATOMs and I'm not somebody who spends mass amounts on online games. 
---
I think 76 could very feasibly last a six year cycle.
---
i love the thing, i use it most of the time when im near my camp.  and i love scaring the shit out of other players with it (passive mode OP) 
---
my one wish is that i want them to extend the range by a healthy chunk
---
It's actually the exact opposite man, he's accusing everyone of having duped weapons maybe he's the one feeling guilty?  Don't let that splash onto the rest of us.  If this post is just about the petition(which I agree with partially btw I use a tesla rifle) than why throw that extra part in?  Clearly the focus in the comments isn't just on that, and you should consider this result if you want to make a singular point next time.
---
&gt; Sometimes wrecks me too! Thanks guy in PA running in front of me.

This is why I stopped using my explosive weapons. Well that and they made combat boring.

Xp is linear.
---
Well rested and canned stew are 5% each. I'm sure its possible.

Nuke xp wasn't nerfed either so a lvl 68 enemy gives 600xp now 120

well the combat shotgun clearly has a clip so :P

Sorry lol, I'm in the car with the wife and the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. didn't play out well in my head. I was meaning Tank Killer/Rifleman.

Yeah this can really cause some rage quits. Fortunately didn't happen to me but happened to a friend. 
---
My first nuke was an awesome experience and also got to kill the queen on the first try. It helped to have a few high level teammates. They were so good they took out the Queen within a couple of minutes before anyone else even got to the nuke zone. It was super laggy but no disconnect.

Turret bases at the resort are N.O.S. - nuke on sight.

How do you get to level 100+?
---
Is there something about bases that causes these fights? I have a camp on the cliffs overlooking the ammunition plant and the other night I logged in and immediately 3 Scorchbeasts attacked. Shortly there after the server crashed, and on a new server the same thing happened after I began wondering down the hill to peak at a presumably unlocked ammunition plant. I heard my turrets start shooting and said oh shit and ran back up the hill. 
---
You know?  I haven't tried mine out either - might be time.
---
That's basically what this thread is about. Get an empty frame, mount your stored pieces on it, then either collect the frame or wait for it to be recalled. It will weigh 10 whateverunits no matter what's on it. You can carry it or store it.
---
I have a shop on the Reddit markets. This keeps me actively gathering items to sell/Trade. 
---
They've spawned at the BOS vendor in Watoga, Watoga station, and Harpers Ferry vendor for me. So far I have motion assist servos on the chest and Tesla coils in storage, overdrive servos for one leg, calibrated shocks for the other, and an arm mod that does increased unarmed damage. 
---
They aren't obvious because none of them day they're for the excavator armor,  you have to look for mods that scrap to black titanium.
---
You could run a packrat build but your damage is neutered.

Might be worthwhile to change your habits instead of changing your build.

My roof took hits from a scorch beast and never broke... that's pretty metal.

Not seeing it, not. “Unplug me” in a high school is just a play in the “kick me” sign. The Enclave message could be for a simulation they had developed (VR exists in the FO universe) or just an allusion to the “reality is a simulation” nonsense that’s in our culture these days. The rest are real stretches.

That must be it, then...it's kind of annoying, getting completely turned around like that. It seems to only happen in the Forest for me, though. Have you encountered it somewhere else as well?
---
Not until graduate school or professional school like med school or law school does any of what you learn actually matters. That however doesn't mean that school is not important. What most people fail to realize is that you are not in school to learn things you will need to use on a regular basis. No. You are there to learn how to LEARN. Your ability to learn things even when you are absolutely not interested or even agree is the most invaluable skill that will benefit you later on in life. Being able to learn things that you don't care about is a skill. It takes practice. Practice that you do while in school with zero responsibility to anyone else. 
---
Not wanting to learn something because you don't agree doesn't show you are intelligent. It just shows you're a pain in the ass to work with. If  you look around in the office and you can't spot the smart ass difficult to work with person, then most likely you are that person.
---
Let's just put it this way. Would you want a neurosurgeon operating you who has proven his ability to learn even the most boring but necessary minutiae or someone who says "fuck it I'll just skim over where the choroidal braches of the PCA arises because it's not fun to learn"?
---
i’ve been bored since level 70 when i finished the main quests. now just go on and clear Whitesprings or hope i sign into a nuked server
---
I dropped a bag with some 3\* armor and weapons for a lvl 41 and his lvl 10 friends at their camp outside the whitespring nuke zone and after a few seconds I see this gauss-rifle wielding lvl 99 wanted player  run up and stand on the bag so the noobies couldn't loot it. The level 41 looked at him, then at me, then at him, then he kind of backed off in fear. 
---
Well, it was my bag, with my items, that I was giving to them, so before he could clear out the bag I sprayed him with half a mag of explosive rounds and send his body parts flying everywhere. I give them a quick thumbs up and leave, and after walking for a minute or so i turn around and see one of them is running after me. He then stops me just so he can give me one last thumbs up and heart before running back to his camp. I feel like they needed that loot way more than that lvl 99 player who was probably just going to sell it.

Lol. I was sad enough to put anything into perception as an unarmed build.
---
I usually get a good idea of who is wandering around the nuked whitespring area and keep track of where they go.  When I run into legendary mobs I will kite them to other players especially low level players so they can tag the enemy and then I kill the enemy so they can get some good loot.  Sometimes people get scared because they think I'm just trying to get them killed by the hordes but usually people get it right away.

Every game has its bugs and well I meant hate as in people raging over a video game, people constantly  saying " I'm done with this pos game f*ck Bethesda and their mom. Like damn dude relax. I see those kind of lost on here alllll the time so I want to understand besides the few bugs I experienced  and the bad stability why they hate the game so badly. [I'm ignoring the power armor and the rum disaster and focusing on the game] and yeah the atom shop.is a cash grab who spends actual money on cosmetics? I don't  but I do think the prices are too high. I'm just focusing on the gameplay. 
---
Lol I'm level 130 dude and use a TSE Minigun. I have no problem melting them and have done the queen a good 30+ times. 
---
It's not about that. It's about the core gameplay of scorchbeast encounters is boring, unintuitive and a general pain. 
---
Regarding the loot system, does a legendary that was hit by multiple people drop loot for all of them? Or does whoever loots the corpse 1st get the loot? 
---
Some people still swear by it, but no one has been able to prove it.
---
Youtubers couldn't prove any difference between level 5, 25, and 100+. I check every few days...no one else seems to be testing it.
---
I personally have seen any changes in camp budget. I haven't been able to place a single copper wire for 10 levels. Scrapping stuff and rebuilding it does not lower the budget the objects take up either. So until I can place a wire...I'm assuming it doesn't increase.

“with pacifist players still having to heal or relocate if another player is chipping away at their health.”

Every player receives slap damage, pacifist or not, until PvP is initiated either by having a bounty or attacking another player with pacifist off.

The damage you receive at all other times, regardless of your pacifist settings, is slap damage
---
It's one of the core themes in my view, especially from the BGS Fallouts onwards, that this is a world where the EPA ain't shit.
---
Toxic dumping everywhere, kids toys have lead and radioactive elements. 
---
And then going by what's implied from gameplay, we find detritus and perishables that SHOULD have decayed in pristine condition even 25-200 years after they were made. Can you imagine what kind of toxic shit must be in a piece of food that is still edible after decades or centuries?
---
And yes, I know it's likely mostly shortcuts for the sake of gameplay, but to me it just fits well with the lore of the world.
---
I think the implication is that the market can be flooded with one type of weapon that is more desirable but far highly available due to duping.  Resulting in a non-ideal weapon being worthless.
---

People, it's in the game we can do whatever the fuck the mechanics let us do, even if you cry like a bitch because of it.

No prob, if you happen to be on Xbox I can deep pocket all marine armor and I only charge the cost of materials (3 adhesive, 3 cloth, 3 leather each piece)

It also works with timing a camera change from 3rd to 1st person or vise versa.

You can trade perk cards from what I can tell.  
---
What I assume Bethesda thought would happen is that everybody in the wastelands would be grouped up and chatting and making friends and trading perk cards/sharing perks and having a jolly ol’ time.  
---
That ain’t happening, though, so we either need an universal trading system of some kind (a vendor bots similar to Pokémon’s GTS would be good) or we need the ability to scrap/reroll useless perk cards. (Maybe a system to select 6 perk cards to scrap and get a Perk Card Pack in exchange)
---
So it's not just me huh? 
---
i have farmed 3 tse's, and atleast 5 or 6 Two Shots. 
---
the tse's i got sucked:  
---
- tse laser pistol level 40
---
- tse the dragon level 30
---
- tse pump action shotgun level 5
---
the two shots i got weren't bad:  
---
- two shot 44
---
- two shot handmade
---
- two shot pump shot gun
---
- two shot assault rifle
---
- two shot .50 cal
---
- two shot tesla rifle
---
The rng system means that some players are going to be luckier than others. when it comes to tse's, the only good ones i have gotten were from trading, but i have gotten 3 tse rolls on my own, they just weren't very great

Maybe he becomes the mysterious stranger!
---
Yeah with Class Freak it reduces the stim pack reduction downside to under 15% if I remember correctly, that's so small a difference and considering you can almost instantly regen with this stacked with ghoulish you almost never worry about health at all, stim packs go back to being a true "oh crap" button.
---
I mean, I'm playing 76 on PC and STO is available on consoles as well. Has been for nearly 2 years now.
---
That's some warrior shit, right there. Also, it seems like a "lost the battle, win the war scenario". Never forget that the breed of dog with the most viscious temperament is not a pitbull, but a little daschund. It's because he doesn't care that he's little, lol.
---
Not really.
---
Its just that some gear/weapons only goes to level 45. But you cant bet Ill happily take a level 45 pump action over a level 50 combat shotgun.
---
Really all that matters is your personal preference.
---
You can get away with it but you'll end up using more stimpacks. We found that having the max level for both really helped everybody out. You can have one person share the perc card that gives everyone extra Charisma based on how many people are in the team to cheat a higher card in there. Most of the people I play with broke down our points to get 9 points in Charisma to be able to do this properly.
---
It works so good that I carry about 10 of each radiation Med in case somebody gets disconnected from the server when I used to carry about 50.
---
(164) I spend a lot less time on the game, basically playing when other friends are on.  My list of things includes:
---
Launching Nukes and Event farming for not so sweet loot.
---
Playing around as an armor smith in the Marketplace.
---
Slowly exploring various spots that I have never visited, or blitzed through initially.
---
Gifting newbies with starting gear.
---
Oh okay, well thanks for the reply 
---
Depends on the quest.  The Order of Mysteries faction quests should be done at around level 25 since each of its quest rewards are upgradeable to higher levels provided that they weren't sold and they have a level requirement of level 25.  Black Diamond (Ski Sword) from Flavors of Mayhem and Daisycutter (Fat Man) from An Organic Solutions have a maximum level of 45.  
---
Might be possible to do all the Brotherhood of Steel quests at any level since you can always grab a new Gatling Gun or Ultracite Laser Gun, but the Ultracite Power Armor from Belly of the Beast might be an issue in the extremely unlikely case that there are lower level versions of it for some stupid reason.
---
Meh. I'll play how I want, thanks.
---
ah, my rng curse seems to be "level 25 nocturnal wood left leg". i've gotten it dropped so many times i can't even count.
---
Yeah I get that.. i'm saying it may not be worth it to repair unless it's really good gear.  You can just replace it more easily.  And soon enough it won't be a problem any more.

I saw a 480 bounty once. Left it TF alone. Something is up there. Probably 3 dudes in stealth and TSE miniguns behind where you'd spawn in.

If you take exp then it mean you tagged it and it's indeed lootable with personal loot for everyone. Only meat and some other junkies looks shared

Im nuking everything I see...Perfecting my CAMP...Helping out low level friends...Grinding for Legendaries...Trying to acquire more caps (If you need to shed a few thousand caps, I would be more than happy to take that burden off your hands)...I have a lot of side quests still left...Tag workshops to initiate PVP without the stupid slapstick mechanic getting in the way...IDK, whatever else I can think of. The game is only as fun as you make it, Im still having a blast.

If this is me (which my “hero” boyfriend and I are 92% sure it is) you’re welcome. In my defense, I was in discord chat which explains the announcing - but not the singing. See you in the wasteland! 🎶
---
I know how all of these things work. I also now have nearly.. 20 full sets of Power Armor. However, if I'd been asked by a lower level I certainly couldn't have put this altogether in words, even though it's very simple. Too many things to think about all the time. Excellent article.
---
Ammo factory is nice, but once you get to the point you can harvest steel, lead, acid, and cloth at a decent level it just becomes more efficient to use the ammosmith/super duper perks and mass produce a shitload of ammo at a tinkers bench.
---
May I suggest a feature such as a warning that the server you’re about to join had a nuke zone plastered right where your about to spawn or some kind of load in invulnerability for a minute?
---
I ask this as several times I have loaded into a server only to load INTO a nuke zone with no protection OR I spawned into a pack of enemies who kill me before I finish loading in and someone else jacks my shit that I had on me.
---
As for the nuke zone warning, ask if you would like to travel to your camp instead or, failing that, vault 76 to avoid losing your stuff due to the insane radiation.
---
Blocking or ignoring should just be account wide and then you don’t have to worry

Yea that part is fine but the blackmail is a bit different. He hit him up offering it back for 50k caps.

#*screech*
---
Well I dotn get disconnects or lag anywhere as much as the first week also I haven't experienced any game breaking bugs. Also the camp has gotten way better. It's the little things definitely way more stable and playable than before 
---
where is the best place to farm legendaries?
---
Thats all I’m seeing are level 62s and I think some in the 40s. But none in golf gear. At all. It’s becoming frustrating. 
---
Yep. It's worth moving it over because you can share level 3 perks a lot easier with your team. 
---
When we aren't in radiation areas I'm usually sharing bloody mess at level 3. Everyone gets an extra 15% damage bonus and the baddies blow up in wonderful pieces of meat. 
---
You haven't lived until you've seen a Scorch mirelurk Queen break into four little parts.
---
Sharing the higher-level cards that way makes them pop off so often your health stays pretty much maxed out. Even at the heavy grinding zones in White Springs and The Scorch Beast Queen event.
---
I tried your suggestion and while it happened immediately after transferring all pieces off the chassis and back on again, it hasn’t happened since then, so your fix may be one of the better ones. 
---
well i took over grafton steel and the lead seemed to take forever to accumulate a good amount
---
Harpoon gun should have a cable mod for pulling down Sierra Bravos.
---
Horribly undervoted.

---
Yes, I'm old.
---
Wait...people actually liked Rose's voice acting?!?!
---
Graham's my favorite.
---
That’s probably what it is. I try to server hop to be the first there but there’s almost always someone else already in the perimeter or just moving away from it. I’ll keep trying. 
---
Have you tried returning them into your camp?
---
Like focus on them, press E and then R?
---
If that’s not working out, restart game or ... as ultima Ratio, destroy them yourself and rebuild them 
---
can you get more orbital strikes somehow?
---
I was following a low level a couple days ago and was getting wrecked by everything that he came across. So I gave him 500 stimpaks to hopefully not die...He was over encumbered but I pointed him to his stash. He was so happy he ran away and got killed by ghouls again... 
---
Thats so shitty lol im glad you at leat killed it. Feel free to add me id totally be down to help out next time.
---
Nuking whitesprings.
---
I'm just going to end this by saying you're the very reason pay2win exists in games. you're an idiot if you think someone paying someone else real cash for what is pretty much the strongest weapons in the game is fair or not against the game's ToS.
---
Oh so even with the different armor pieces it will only weigh 10 pounds?
---
Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question, I have legitimately never used PA because I am confused about this
---
you can find them alot on the mire. i run into them alot over near raleigh clays bunker
---
Found a crashed satellite once! I didn't realize it was specific locations that spawn stuff like that. One more thing to love about this game!
---
It probably caused a lot of bugs. They rushed the game and it was easier to turn on the feature than fix it.
---
well i took over grafton steel and the lead seemed to take forever to accumulate a decent ammount 
---
Might wanna try the White Springs vendors. I think there's a vendor there that has them.
---
Yeah, that's because high levels farm Whitesprings so much. The mobs spawn in as lvl 62s to give them a challenge. It does not take into account lower levels. You can server hop until you find one with only lvl 9s
---
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU!
---
Sudden Scorch Beast blast from the same direction
---
Get stuck on a rock, robot corners me
---
My doom fell before I realized both nature and science have decided that I was not worthy of existence. 
---
I struggle with this one too, but rather than the table settings, it’s the robots breaking down. There’s just so many quest markers all flagged up at once I get confused and just start running around panicking. 
---
I really don’t like much of what’s on the shop at the moment.
---
Materials
---
There were probably all kinds of bugs with people running around with no arms and floating guns. It would have been easier to just turn it off than fix it before a rushed launch.
---
In a nuke zone in whitesprings u can level up hella fast. I leveled up 6 levels in about 30 minutes while chilling and taking my time. It’s mostly just a result of so many high level enemies giving u xp
---
I'd like perk card loadouts to swap in and out
---
I checked, no luck there :(
---
jokes on you, I have it bound to my mouse button
---
Do note that even in the bog there's a lot of those deep ditches everywhere that probably block off their landing.
---
Of course not - it’s real money stuff 
---
They are literally all over the place inside.  
---
Look for the plates with forks and knives on them, they're white and are on floors and cabinets all over.  There are also more than 26 I think, so you dont need to find em all.
---
Yeah that's not a bad place just doesn't have plastic which I'm always out of lol
---
Thank you! Feel free to join if you're interested. 
---
This is very plausible =P
---
lvl 160, farm the queen and whitesprings for legendaries and flora. sell them on reddit marketplace. Trying to collect every outfit in the game (have them all except for a few from travelling responders vendor). Bounty hunting is fun. nuked some dude that built his camp where i usually have mine (we had a good laugh about it, partied up, nuked whitesprings n hung out for a while. it was a surprisingly good time)  
---
also, look for people that need help doing things and help run them thru it, make armor, weapons, camp items for lowbies, just generally try to help out fellow wastelanders.
---
This works with Whitesprings golf course as well, and I've been exploiting the hell out of it.
---
Basically you kill the legendary FIRST, then all other mobs in the same spawn seem to have a chance to drop legendaries.
---
Ofc at Whitesprings this means a shitload of 1* items which you end up paper-bagging, but.....
---
You know what it's probably the dupers wjere in your server. I noticed this the other day when playing with  a group some of us would disconnect randomly luckily we could join the other back  and later on we found this vendor who was clearly a duper.  Who Carries 50 serums of each at level 7???? After he left no crashes at all for the rest of the night we even nuked prime 2 times 
---
I can do it for you if you bring me the materials
---
Vault 13 wasn't set to open until 200 years after the war, and vault 101 was set to never open, under any circumstances. Vault 8, while also a control vault may have been under separate circumstances.
---
The main reason 76 can't be used once opened is that after 24 hours of the vault opening, it's resealed and all of the life support systems are shut off. The reason why isn't really specified, but it's probably as part of a Vault-Tec test.
---
Soooo...what would happen if you 'accidentally' clipped a WS robot just as a ghoul horde spawned, and happened to train said robots into the firing line of the camp turrets?  
---
A friend was asking.
---
Bethesda, hire this man
---
Free States - Abbie is my favorite NPC in the game - she's adorable.  Also every faction should have a unique building set as well - Free States bunkers all over the mire.
---
I just found a hermit crab using a truck for a shell the other day. That was fun to kill but it dropped NOTHING 🙄
---
And again, true, but this guy was leveling up 10 times in mere minutes, plus it was prime nuke.
---
No but I can level up 5-10 levels in 30 mins or so if I hustle real good with my explodey 10mm submachine gun that’s apparently good. Could the 290 guy have been stacking his levels tho? Like right before we were able to move special points around I banked the 10 levels to move points into intelligence that I needed 
---
You can harvest a large amount of steel and lead by doing a nuke silo run, or by running around and killing the bots that constantly spawn in watoga.
---
I think it might give you -2 perception. I know some masks do, worth checking.
---
Warehouse just opens new pieces to build with. They are similar to the barn pieces except it’s metal but I’m not sure what the building components are. I’m not sure how to expand the budget but I would sure like to know. 
---
what is the enclave thing beside your name mean 
---
Workshop budgets are either all the same i think or they increase as levels increases. I’m not particularly sure but I know turrets take up massive amounts of budget so check ur turret count
---
Could have been placeholder (just copying over dying human animations from fo4) or a scrapped idea. There's plenty of stuff like this in games all the time. The black ops 4 zombies crowd was upset because they saw some of the fan favorite weapons in the trailer and thought they would be coming back, but they were just placeholders from black ops 3
---
You don't really take on scorchbeasts. They take on you.
---
They happily spot and chase you from a mile or two away.
---
10 out of 600 isn't *that* much, especially if it's only one frame... Sell your extra (bulked) junk and unused weapons/armor, dump the ammo you don't use.
---
That appears to be an ambitious project.  I really do not know the numbers of acid/steel/powder you would need for that or how much time you have to devote to a project like that but you might consider  a partnership to meet that level of production.
---
Server hop in watoga, there's pa spawn on top of emergency building and another one a quick jump away by the crashed vertibird. Both have a good chance to spawn lvl50 t51b. There's supposed to be 3 more spawns in watoga but idk them.
---
There's also 'fixed' encounters.
---
There's a tea party with stuffed animals and toys and at least 6 different kinds of hats.
---
There's a literal safe house which is full of safes to crack.
---
There's a little gnome hiding behind a clipboard inside a computer monitor with computer circuits and a screw driver. 
---
It's more scenary than interactive but there's details like this that tells me someone had fun working on the guy and that fun transmitted to having fun during the game.
---
Unlike, say, Destiny 2 which felt more like a chore than a game.  
---
Sorry for the late reply, but there's a water hazard around the green with snaptails growing around it. There's your violet flux ✌🏻
---
I do believe your camp budget gets bigger as you level up, and also using turrets will chew up your budget massively as well.
---
I think the warehouse plans are just another type of wall for you to use (like the barn, brick, and steel plans).
---
Wide-open field full of irrigation trenches. They're not going to land because they don't want to fall into one! SMH...
---
I was attcked by a scorch beast recently in Flatwoods. It was hanging around the big bridge and attacked with a bunch of  10 and unders in town. 
---
Most high level players who have finished the main game will be willing to team up if you ask. Don't be afraid to reach out. Jerks are a minority.
---
Oh that'd be great! 
---
Door Opens, Ghoul comes forward..."Hi, I'm Dick Shale" and then begins to tell you the story of how he is where he is now, in the same manner as all the other Dick Shale bits in the game (including the blooper one)!
---
Do you remember if it was on a terminal or a Holotape? I’ll have to go read back through things again. 
---
I’m lvl 100+ Rushed through all the content and exploited xp wahhh why is this there no end game this game has no content REEEEEE 
---
^ 
---
I dislike these kinda ppl so much this is not world of Warcraft there is no need to rush to the end for anything in this game it’s cleatly about the journey 
---
Oh well but good looking out. 
---
Fair point, even so, seems like they should land at some point. If I had to bet, I'd say they are not working 100% as intended. Not landing is just one of several issues I've noticed
---
I love the game too, I hit 250 hours a few days ago :)
---
I don't know why he's getting downvoted lmao, both R\* and ND don't lie with their gameplay videos.
---
I just stopped picking locks unless it's a door that I don't have a key for (doesn't happen anymore).  Non-door containers never contain anything more valuable than an unlocked container so it's not worth the time to swap in the perks or even go through the moment of lockpicking.
---
Yah, I'm not sure why more people don't scrap the frames after scrapping the armor for mods. It gives decent junk.
---
The tattered dress doesn't just *look* better, it * is* better. The garb takes up the armor and underarmor slots, and is nowhere near a replacement for an upgraded underarmor and 5 pieces of leveled up, modded, legendary (up to 3 stars each) armor. The tattered dress, on the other hand, goes in the cosmetic outfit slot, and is the only outfit I've found with any kind of bonus.
---
Preston 
---
if a frame has armor pieces to high level for you, after you've removed them and entered the frame to claim it. get out and put the armor pieces back on the frame then wait 60 seconds. the game will auto recall the frame back to your inventory then you can put it in the stash. i only ever kept 3 frames leveling up, one excavator, one raider with peices my level, and one empty that had any lvl 45+ peices i found.
---
that is a better plan tbh but i was drastically low on ammo so i needed a less resource consuming method of harvesting
---
That's exactly what a raider would do. 
---
I get a loss of sound if I do anything with my wireless headset, then I have to restart to get audio back. Only have this problem with fallout and the headset is still working fine with discord etc when it happens.
---
Ur right I can’t think of a particular explanation for that
---
Loved the Westworld reference in their conversation too. 
---
"How about we kill all the humans?"
---
"Doesn't look like anything to me!"
---
I recall my first time coming across one of these nukes. . . .
---
I had fast travelled to my CAMP with my friend to do some thrilling inventory management before we continued on our way through the Rose’s whimsical wishes for us in the Top of the World quest line. I finished clearing some space to hopefully be capable of picking up a weapon and perhaps a couple pieces of junk before I was over encumbered again, and so while my friend concluded with his tasks at my stash, I decided to meander out into the forest; that ominous sense of treachery was almost palpable for me at such a low level at that time. 
---
I wandered probably a quarter mile away from my CAMP and encountered a highway. No problem. Then I noticed a Scorched One maybe a hundred yards or so down the road. I proceeded to jog toward it to get a better shot—as ammo was scarce at those levels. As I neared the Scorched One the highway began to arch a different direction around some hills...and that’s when I saw it...
---
There was a gaping hole in the highway just behind the Scorched One, and there I saw maybe twenty or more of those fiends creeping out of that hole. That creeping became more intense and purposeful, and then it transitioned to a sprint in my direction. I had not yet fully processed the situation to determine my next move, but I wish I had; out of that gaping hole flew a Scorchbeast. 
---
Before this moment I had never come into contact with this creature I knew only to be the source of my death. I had one option: run. I sprinted as far as my pathetic AP could take me, and I heard the screams and screeches of the Scorchbeast, and the groans of the Scorched Ones in hot pursuit. That first sound of the radiation sonar beam from the Scorchbeast rang in my ears and muffled the sounds of my comrade calling out that he was on his way. I saw him to the left of me and yelled for him to “RUN!”
---
That’s when we came across it...a nuclear bomb resting in the soil before us. There wasn’t time for us to admire the sight, or theorize the probabilities of a bomb failing to explode; the choice was clear: try to set it off. I ran up to it, saw several options show up, and clicked the first one I saw. 
---
A couple seconds passed and my screen became a white light. I knew that light meant death, but it was a death much more glorious than dying the treacherous death of something born out of nature—I chose my death, in my time, and I felt like Captain Ahab probably would have felt if he had conquered his fate to defeat the whale using the wit and weapons of humankind.
---
This thread has the same exact number of likes and comments 148/148 I liked and I am commenting to keep it up
---
Yes. I’m selling the plans for it on PS4
---
I am currently walking my BF through the quest line to get the items from him to give to a friend who accidentally got rid of hers, lol.
---
Yea, if it looks like a Power Armor mod but doesn't have a type (T-45, 51, etc) listed it's probably for the Excavator.
---
Nah, they were just instant crashes. Dupers cause a ton of "waiting for response from server" and general lag/instability before it finally crashes
---
I assumed the distance you could be to named areas was reasonably large. I camped on the golf course but not in an asshole way like above
---
Its just the flair I chose for the sub.
---
in the sidebar on the right scroll down until you see something that says "Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like".
---
Then click the edit button that is beside your username. Choose a flair, and then click save.
---
Thank you for the offer, do you know where you got it or was it from scrapping?
---
I set up camp on the golf course and they spawned while I was building. It took me about 3 minuets before I took them out.
---
Gate keeping for what?  I'm not even sure what your on about anymore.  You seem to have read a helluva lot more than what I ever posted. 
---
me too. middle click is always my grenade hotkey in any game
---
Snallygasters drop 6 apiece, but this assumes you have the means to kill them when your purpose is making ammo.  There's a toxic meat shop on the map somewhere that tends to have a few, also lots of events in the cranberry bog feature them.
---
Yes but doesn't that take up a shit ton of stash space?
---
I think I’m still thinking of this as the beta phase. 
---
I’m level 105, and I’m really just perfecting my character build right now in anticipation of dlc.
---
i dont believe it just because of their belief in K.I.S.S.(keep it simple stupid) and something that deep is anything but simple, though i would love for it to be true
---
so do ppl who follow the enclave see t or whats it related to directly, like i cant click on it, im suck a noob to reddit 
---
... on the other end you've got those trying to get some hero-worship by telling a mundane story about how they drop some useless loot for a noob and maybe shot a glowing mole rat for them. 
---
I couldn’t find it myself so I had to buy it lol
---
Doesn't affect players though
---
Xbox i'm afraid 
---
Check r/market76 I think I saw one for sale earlier
---
I noticed "FLUSH TWICE DAMMIT!" written on one of the walls of the stalls in the bathroom by Whitesprings Resort . Got a little chuckle out of it.
---
That’d be cool, I mean they could incorporate that into a new faction later on. He had the skills and money to start somewhere new. 
---
Haha never thought I would relate to a scorched beast :)
---
On a serious note, I'm well accustomed to working around flaws in Bethesda games but at some point we gotta say "hey maybe Bethesda should actually fix this" lol
---
I think the gatling plasma also suffers from the same issue as gatling lasers, which will prioritize loading the core with the LOWEST charge in it when reloading.
---
I assume they will add in new weapons with every big update
---
Still very unsure about how viable energy weapons are, especially energy pistols 
---
So with this trick, do the actual PA pieces not take up stash weight?
---
Perhaps, but Bethesda aren't helping themselves are they? Leaking data, poor products (Nuka dark rum is awful and goes for 80 bucks a plastic shelled bottle ) They're giving YouTubers all the ammo they want.
---
I have Deep Pocket Limbs and regular pocket for chest. I don’t really know... make an offer. 
---
Find me here. PSN user rickpenna 
---
drugs help
---
And would explain the origin of the mysterious stranger.. they are all trained in the order of mystery and are different people thru the years. It's Frederick carrying on the ideal.
---
I have regular pocket chest, wanting deep. Thank you though, I’ll check your lists
---
Gore was toned down a lot from Fallout 4.
---
I've mentioned this before in another thread of my own, but explosions don't cause dismemberment or exploding limbs, and melee weapons don't dismember on death either, like at all.
---
I think they minimized the gore in the game for sync reasons, but it's really unfortunate, since Fallout has always been a pretty visceral, and graphic game.  They shouldn't be toning it down at all.
---
It’s odd, you’d think she’d of mentioned him and his demise. If I come across something I’ll let you know. 
---
I’m xb1. It’s off rn 
---
Of course, the train west of Watoga station is where I got all of my plans
---
Sometimes it takes a few minutes to load up.
---
There is a way... involves an unused chassis...
---
I have noticed that sometimes it is there and sometimes it is not....  I think much of this game is based on Almond Joy Commercials.. 
---
It's great fun and has a few bugs. Like a lot of newly released games. But, you know, Bethesda bad and stuff.
---
Yes, yes, they've made some bad decisions (canvas bag stuff, claiming stuff was on offer in the atom store when it was only just put in there, allowing dupers to run riot for weeks) but there's an absolute ton of BS controversies over the game. It's bizarre. BoS being in was apparently blasphemous because it wasn't mentioned in FO 1, 2 or NV. The complete lies about there being no encryption and us being hacked on PC. The trade steal glitch we all were worried about for weeks that turns out to be untrue. The nuka rum 'controversy' because apparently it's a big deal that the glass bottle is in a big plastic nuka cola bottle (yes it's stupid money, it's memorabilia ffs the rum probably isn't that great even). There being no story (I must be playing a different game). There's others I've forgotten too.
---
Mine would be "The Distracted".  I exited the vault with rebuilding as my...
---
ooohhh shiny what is that over there....60 levels later
---
...goal and finding out just what...
---
Mutations?  I need those...wait this toxic waste dump is NOT doing anything other then making my health turn red maybe I need water..
---
why wont this damn wall snap to its location
---
New Event: Death from above!  Where is my PA!
---
I need to try out the phantom device on scorch beasts when they decide to spawn on top of my head.  Making more of them might be a challenge though.
---
Kudos mang. It’s not the strongest armour but I use mine too. 
---
Problem is I seem to be experiencing a/the bug where I’m not gaining the carry weight improvement from the armour :(
---
Don't get it. Can you explain?
---
I may have too as well. I’ve been scrapping like crazy to try and get it and no go
---
I got a level 40 gatling gun with explosive, nocturnal and one more perk (think its one that gives you DR while reloading) from one of the terminals in the whitespring bunker, was pretty pleased with that. Figured the guy that sold it got an upgrade.
---
But at least I know it’s possible 
---
&gt; I do believe your camp budget gets bigger as you level up
---
It's my understanding that the budget caps at a certain level; someone here has previously said 50.
---
For food, just get the dog food perk. it's only 1 point in END, and it triples effects of dog food. 1-2 will completely fill hunger.
---
As for drink, there's both the nuka cola buffing perk for 1-2 points and the CHA perk for alcohol, though alcohol weighs more.
---
try the train carriage a bit west of watoga station
---
Id rather stumble upon an outhouse with a mod of ghouls actively attacking it. Kill them, open the door, and find Todd's skleleton, he died stuffing prewar money down the toilet.
---
Moving them did not work, but storing and rebuilding did. Thanks. I'm surprised this isn't a wide spread thing yet.
---
Fuckin lame
---
Because it is a weapon that does little damage yet causes massive issues for everyone in the fight. It's not a frame issue it's a stability issue. If you don't get either of those you probably shouldn't get in a fight with the SBQ either.
---
Oh yeah I am. I already went through that debacle last year. 
---
For an update I disabled fallouts in game vsync and used Nvidia as own version. It’s smoothed it out by a lot but I do still feel like maybe half a millisecond little pauses as I navigate around the world. Not even like entering whole new areas but like maybe like every 50 feet. Muuuuuch better, now it honestly feels like streaming loading. Wish I could get rid of it though.
---
Not according to people who have them, and did tests? I don’t have one, so I can’t do my own.
---
My AUTOMATIC pipe rifle..
---
The lantern weapon idea with the mothman just really ices the whole delicious cake.
---
Super dupper when crafting stable fluxes.  Hearing that proc brings a tear to my eye.
---
it may be build dependant, im a heavy gunner so when i hit watoga i swap in melee cards for the robots and run a sledgehammer (only needs steel+adhesive to repair) my camp is on a steel resource and i grow plants for adhesive so its borderline free with how i set myself up
---
i recommend the can do perk in the luck stack at level 2. i never have to worry about food, i just loot trashcans and find Cram, imitation seafood, canned coffee, potato crisps, purified water, and canned dog food.
---
It's from someone completing the feed the people event
---
No there aren't, normally I take workshops and the first thing I build are water pumps .. I used to take workshops just to mine water :)
---
Stating the amount of increase does not imply the amount that they commit to increase in the future.
---
They never said anything about implementing any "remaining" 50% because there's nothing remaining.  They never said anything about a 2 part increase where the 50% increase was part 1 of 2, and part 2 of 2 would be in the future.  "Remaining 50%" doesn't even make sense because another 200 would be 33% now.

Try it while wearing PA at the doorway at the golf course using the charging barrel. Crashes me nearly every time. Xbox
---
Also note, that the weekly challenge last week required a helmet, meaning that this costume didn't count for most of the pictures needing to be taken.  My friend was pretty put out that he had to go back, switch characters to one that actually had a closet full of outfits in order to do the challenge... 
---
TL;DR w/o the helmet being separate it doesn't count for challenges requiring a hat...
---
homebois, you can see all your pictures in "gallery" or whatever it's called. don't have to wait for them to appear as loading screens.
---
Ahh, I didn't know it boosted them that much, I know it did some but Dayum!
---
I'll give you my atom shop, not like I need it 
---
unfortunately im on the X1
---
Responders. Closest thing we have to Sunbros.
---
Yes, it does. 
---
When you claim a workshop, it comes with its own stock of building materials ready to use.   Now it isn't infinite and you can't loot them and take them somewhere else, but you can use them freely.   
---
Next time you claim a workshop, go to build something and look at the materials required.   If they show as green, those are the free ones that came with the workshop.   Once they go from green to black (or white whatever), that's when you're back to using your own personal supply of junk.   Check it out.   
---
I've run into the arguing Mr Handy's, didn't know that I should go to the same spot multiple times though... now I'm going to revisit that spot!
---
Platform
---
You can, actually, and you can even bind it to whatever you'd like on PC.  I changed mine to mouse 4 day before yesterday in fact.
---
Sounds good to me mate
---
Thank you! That makes a lot of sense. And no one can steal it from you after it's yours, right?
---
ok sounds like a plan....  is this considered a message?
---
It's a raider's life for me.
---
I think everyone here with an Xbox should log on and message this guy now.
---
PC. Thanks forgot to put in the system :)

The red rocket by watoga has one that reads, "For a happily ever after, give Fiona a call."

Got us an RP tryhard here. 
---
No, as a good Steward I came to Reddit on my character's behalf.
---
I mentioned that it doesn't make much sense that Vault 76 isn't itself somehow used, or explained why it isn't used. Even a throwaway line that it wasn't supplied with enough power resources or parts to keep the air circulation systems operating past opening day would've covered it.
---
Some vaults stuck together, some did not. Some had internal civil disputes. Much like the outsidce survivors, populations react in different ways, and without the forced cohabitation of a vault, its just as likely as not for them to have gone off to do their own things. The Vault was the "best and brightest" allegedly, which is not a criteria that necessarily includes close knit social bonds or even a friendly atmosphere.
---
As the OVerseer not initially trusting us with her personal quest. "So, I found out Vault Tek was evil, and decided to keep working for them anyways because it was still the best shot. And abandoned/betrayed my beloved husband in order to keep on with their mission. So, you guys totally trust coming with me right?"
---
The Holotapes eventually switch over to asking for help, but thats because she's overwhelmed at just how badly the world's gotten, and already nearly died at Mount Blair to the mole miners, realizing she might not be able to do it herself.
---
I would love to see Vault Dungeons or "Vault Runs." These could be end-game dungeons where you enter a vault with a squad and have to kill waves of enemies, high-level legendaries, solve puzzles using terminals and notes that you find in the vault, pass various skill checks like lockpicking etc. and generally learn the story of this particular vault. At the end could be a 4-5 star legendary mob that drops a special weapon specific to that Vault Run. Additionally in each vault would be vault suits and other collectibles specific to that vault so you can show off your accomplishments.
---
are you fucking high or what? this story is a joke, the game is a cashgrab and they bailed on the story and role playing aspects to cut costs and/or development time. its obvious.
---
Another sort order should be relevance and then sorted by newest.  For example, if a quest requires a holotape to be inserted in a holotape player, it should be first in the list along with any other holotape that is relevant to that terminal (i.e. government supply drop).  
---
At least they fixed the bug where immediately playing a holotape ends in silence and then you have to find it in your inventory to listen to it.
---
i'll give it a look! say while i'm on it any leads on the leveractions or radium rifles? i hear it drops from patrol duty but farming that event is cancer haha
---
ok
---
The cars are actually nuclear powered. They have mini reactors. 
---
It's right there in the type of game
---
&gt;*Yeah, hid in a house and even swapped in the vats limb-target perk to do it, along with the limb crippling perk for rifles and the one for shotguns.*
---
This is very strange. I use a handmade that isn't decked out in conjunction with VATS and I usually kill scorchbeasts in seconds to maybe 2 minutes. for every additional scorchbeasts, add 3 minutes.
---
I'll put my money where my mouth is too, I'll upload a video when I get home from work today.
---
I doubt it will show you anything that you don't already know but It's worth it if it does.
---
It’s only happened to me twice, I can’t remember where.
---
I wonder if it triggers a spawn. Because the first time I listened to it I was mobbed by a dozen or so right after it finished.
---
Where's the beef?
---
Ah, another episode of "I made a mistake so i'm going to blame the game."
---
Woops, i scrapped one last night. 
---
what? the kid was a little gangster and he turned on his kidnapper and killed him, even though the kidnapper who was his uncle was trying to affect a positive change by standing up to to the corporate greed of grafton steel. why do you say it "fucked you up" and "its the worst one i think".
---
Good sir you are a saint and a scholar tyvm
---
You have a mic? And what level are you?
---
This lady got straight musical beatbox about what she was doing to her modifications and what supplies she needed to make em. It was wonderfully bizarre. From the interactions between the two people (I feel like a creeper but I mean I was just farming the golf club and it WAS open mic) I felt like they didnt know each other all that well. Could be misread though.
---
If it was you, keep that mic open! It adds a little bit of flavor between the grind to hear genuine human voices interacting.
---
Yeah. I ended up going with the cropped haircut, or maybe the boxer haircut, or something that gave the overall look (with the mask) a nice paramilitary vibe.
---
It would be nice but would be to powerful 
---
I would only want phones and globes!
---
Making a post here when I'm offline is not immersion breaking. Getting a message requesting gear in game is. 
---
you win this round i guess.
---
Bought a shock mod watched the caps deducted when I got to the base it was gone 
---
You still lvl tho even if you dont pick a special. No?
---
I think it’ll be little longer than that...
---
Its Happened to mena couple of times, just move your power armor station and it will be fine.
---
Just got that the other night at a station i built in my c.a.m.p
---
My friend.
---
You're saying you're consciously ignoring bad things that are happening to you in an effort enjoy the game more.
---
A lot of people can only do that for so long. After the 15th time something bugs out, it gets really fucking old.
---
That's besides the horrible gun damage and durability balance. And the lack of information on plans. The buggy VATS interactions. The level-locked vendor plans not functioning properly.
---
I could probably casually list 30 things that are either downright bad/lazy game design or designer oversights/bugs.
---
The base gameplay is super fun. The environment is pretty great. The concept is 20/10... Which is the real problem. If this game even just *worked better,* I'd be able to forgive tons of lazy decisions and direct ports they made.
---
But to be lazy in those decisions and not be able to deliver a properly functioning game just isn't okay.
---
To me, this game feels like a beta from like 10 years ago.
---
I just close the back door and kite down the hall. Let them have their base up. *shrugs*
---
A turret takes about 9.8 - 10% of your budget each turret. Keep that in mind when making a camp
---
Something I have noticed is that if there is nowhere for them to land they just won't.
---
Yeah it's a spin off I mean not the topical fall out and well the bos Appalachia chapter are all dead lol anyways yeah the canvas I get. Atom shop is a clear cash grab why anyone buys stuff on there is beyond me. I am mad that the prices are outrageous to the point where you have to spent money if you one more than 2 high priced items. And like I said who spends  80$ one one bottle of rum just for the bottle it came in???? I hate the story I haven't  finished it lol no NPCs in a fallout open world game? Wack but hey theres real people you can interact with
---
Finish the Mayor for the Day quest line in Watoga before you decide to farm the bots there since once you finish it they won't attack you.  They will individually attack once you attack them but its way better then getting a bunch attacking you all at once.  I like to wander around Watoga from time to time and farm lead and look for legendary bots that pop up sometimes.
---
I can craft it for you. But I don’t have the plans
---
Thats a shame
---
Weird how that works for a games critic.
---
your character sent you to reddit to tell us not to message you while he is playing?  Or do you mean that while he is in existence by becoming dehydrated and hungry in the game that is on the xbox, that we should try and communicate as a mime with a horn would on a Peanut's HOLIDAY special if they were an adult talking to the kids?
---
once you enter the frame once its yours, you can drop it and walk away or even log out and it will warp back to your inventory after 60 seconds. so no one can steal it. if you want to get rid of it or give it to someone you have to open your inventory and drop it instead of place it.
---
beware though, there is a bug that lets people enter your power armor if you have it on a crafting station. i always make sure no one is around me when i want to put my armor on a station to do any changes
---
I'll add you! I do all sorts; camp building, exploring, events. After I've done my daily vendor run anyway.
---
Happy to team up and do stuff. What do you do in-game?
---
Nah, what is done is try just click on the workshop as if they want to take it over but then immediately open their map and fast travel closest to you as they can, then run in and attack. Apparently they stay flagged for PvP for you for awhile even though they left the workshop’s area.
---
Some people think this accounts for the stories of people being one shot out of no where, and also why people reporting such things often note if they hadn’t owned a workshop when it happened.
---
I've gotten a bounty while having pacifist mode on, I accidentally shot a turret in a friend's workshop while helping him defend it. Happened before we were able to join in a team just an fyi
---
They very seldomly spawn, I got the quest around lvl 30 and finished it around lvl 70.
---
Would say Enclave but didn’t they try to murder everyone in D.C just because they lived in the wasteland. Not about genocide. 
---
Maybe BOS (as long as the Elder isn’t a nutcase)
---
* Chewing Buffout* Fuck it. Raiders it is. 
---
I've only ever encountered 1. It's &gt;!the raider quest and you find that the corpse you're retrieving from the trappers is booby trapped with a bomb!&lt;
---
I've yet to encounter more but I've love to know if there are more than that one if you happen to know more.
---
Probably a Two Shot Explosive shotgun it's a decent street sweeper.
---
Suit yourself
---
So... you rewarded their incompetence by buying the game twice. Interesting.
---
I'm sick.
---
Not just in my mind, but I know that's true too.
---
Just sick.
---
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't shit. Fuck this pain, man. But gotta keep going.
---
Got good at channeling it. Dipshit mutey crosses me now on a bad day and my rifle talks for me. No fucking pity.
---
Found some armour that eases the pain.....sometimes. Gotta stand still though. Doesn't matter. No damn energy to move.
---
Rads help some. I dunno if I'm fucked up or if it's the sickness, but I can jump real high, don't hurt when I land either. Eyesight gets better as the urge to puke increases. Feels like I can do more with my gun. Sweet gun - channels the pain. Don't fuck with me and my gun when I'm feeling sick...
---
Ate a ghoul today. Fuck it, easy protein, right? Felt better.
---
It's weird. I can move faster, shoot smarter, rifle seems like part of me. But the nausea...and the headaches...jumping off the Top of the World starting to look real attractive some days, but then...
---
...fucking muteys ain't taking MY land. Or the ghouls. Or those scorched bastards. Got one of their bat-assholes the other day. Damn thing was stupid enough to land near me. Tasted just FINE.
---
Not sure the damn disease can kill me though. I try sometimes. Doesn't work. Always wake up. Fine. Universe fucks me, I fuck back. My rifle's a damn good dick.
---
...what do I do next?
---
It's so lonely.
---
KK i work at bethesda and I'll make it so every legendary drops nothing but 4 star TSE items. Your input is appreciated!
---
the one next to the station or the one forlorn a ways from it that spawns an assultron near it?
---
Hmm, I never have an issue with crippling Scorchbeasts with Concentrated Fire 1 + Enforcer 3 @ left &amp; right wings. Usually takes 3-5 shots then give them a few seconds to land before going for the head. Used that method with a combat shotgun to bring down 4 of them in one fight.
---
I also used Skeet Shooter 3 for tighter bullet spread. VATS typically between 10% - 30%
---
I have seen multiple people who have them, and have done tests, state that while it only adds one pellet to the shot, it double the damage.
---
Like, if you hold a level 50 basic combat shotgun and a level 50 basic two shot combat shotgun next to each other the two shot will read exactly double damage.
---
If someone has a picture or personal experience counter to this I'd love to hear/see it.
---
r/fo76bazaar is a good place for selling and trading
---
Where tf is the bethesda replies bot... It should be all over this. Todd, your peeps ain't doing there job. We are TELLING YOU HOW WE WANT TO PLAY, since you suck at figuring it out. Just take the damn advice and make the game fun FFS.
---
you're absolutely right, but the bethesda shills will be through to downvote your post sadly. they are a sad company that undermines their own fans. corporate greed at its worst
---
Tks, I didn’t knew that!
---
Three little pigs for me, not sure if it changes based on location though
---
It used to work a while back but ot was patched. Just tried on a t60 set. Used to be, if you had the materials you could add the shock to the second leg as long as you didnt leave the screen, not anymore though 
---
If you can't suspend disbelief for a few moments and ignore it then I think the fault is with you. Is it also immersion breaking that your characters world fits inside a rectangle a few feet in front of you? Or that you are sitting in a chair while your character is in a bog?
---
He'll, be creative and just think of it like a texting feature built into the pipboy if you have to. We're all supposed to be from the same vault.
---
I think I will not buy an Xbox today so that I can send him a message.  Someone with an Xbox please send a message from My Character on the Play Station to his character that we will not be able to talk together while in character.  
---
Everything tho xD im lvl 70 so i have most things after me ^^
---
Craft them at the Tinker bench. They require some yellowcake flux though so they're moderately expensive.
---
I was pretty amazed that when you repair something and you are missing a material, a mod will be used instead and lost, seems like a really stupid mechanic to add to the repair system. 
---
Or a simple case of r/boneappletea
---
You are doing God's work, son.
---
Any chance you’d be inclined to share some of these locations? I’d love to check them out for myself
---
Your PA station may be placed too near a wall that prevents the animation of you squatting to fix it. Try moving it forward.
---
There's a fist full of weapons that are crazy like that.   
---
My first guess is 2 shot exploding shotgun. After that is 2 shot explosive minigun. Or 2 shot explosive flame thrower.
---
That guy gave me a useless Confederate Hat Plan. Can't learn it and I can't craft it. 
---
Pretty easy to indicate hunger, thirst, sickness, or danger, among other things with the emotes. You can also request a trade or give a team invite. I asked nicely.
---
Watching this made me think how VATs should be able to be changed to default to head.
---
I like to check and see if there are any low levels near the vault when im at my base, If there are I throw a few lvl 1 machetes together with serrated edge. Nice little starter weapon.
---
I have gotten the Wooden Patio Chair plans twice now from claiming or defending the workshop at Thunder Mountain Power Plant.  If your on xbox I can give you my extra one I got.
---
Un-perked a tse shotgun can I shot a ghoul, perked it’s even nastier.  I am rifle build and my tee shotgun still does 400+ dmg
---
"fixing" it. just like they fixed duping, and made servers "stable". pft k.
---
No different than the ingredient containers at mama dolces.
---
Yep. The noobtube of FO76.
---
Hmm, that might be the cause of my missing mods then. I crafted a full set of Excavator PA a while ago. That is indeed a really stupid mechanic. 
---
Anyone else figure out what the mysterious button in a porta potty in a raider camp does?
---
I hadn't even checked that, hopefully that's not the case for me, and hopefully not much longer for you! 
---
That sounds so cool, time to make Appalachia great again!
---
I generally log out when I got afk to save a life.  When I did this late last night I came back logged back in and went from level 21 almost 22, back to level 20.   But had double armor and weapons in my inventory.
---
Bro there are like 10 forward bases in the cranberry bog, all of which have 2-3 military ammo bags/ducktape lying around.
---
McClintock has what, 1?
---
I like the idea of having the passive abilities or significant perks cost points instead
---
Correct. When you really think about it. You as in IRL you are playing the simulation FO76. And you “unplug” when you log off.
---
When I joined this subreddit I had to Google TSE
---
No, armor pieces go on the frame, and *only* the frame takes up weight (you can keep it in your inventory or put it in your Stash, it will stay 10).
---
Same, 3 crashes in a row trying to put some legendary guns into my stash. Every time I could rejoin my friend on the server only for it to happen again. That and trying to join a party via an Xbox invite is most likely to crash the game
---
seriosuly thought fuck TSE
---
Responders, but mainly for the the baddass firebreathers
---
Would be really cool to have a shared chest among 2-3 servers near the vault for veterans to drop old gear and new players to pick through
---
See, to me it looks like black frosted glass.  I think my mind observed it this way after seeing its price tag and thinking surely they wouldn't be charging this much for plastic.
---
Then why are there occasionally leaks coming out of the cars? There are visuial puddles with a rainbow shine to them, but that's from oil and as far as I know, I don't believe cars powered by electricity (from a nuclear reaction) use oil much if at all?
---
Not saying you're wrong, I actually do believe you're right because I wasn't thinking much about it, but it's weird nonetheless. 
---
You decide how you play an rpg, not everyone else.
---
Agreed, its probably a two shot explosive shotgun. For everyone reading, run in front the person shooting it in a nuke zone and they will kill themselves. 
---
Contrary to my user name, there is proper etiquette to be followed in nuke zones. I dont use explosive weapons in whitesprings unless I am completely alone. For those who do, my teams favorite things to do are run in front while you are shooting and/or follow you to your base afterwards and level it and you as soon as you leave the nuke zone. 
---
Awesome. Very helpful. Thank you.
---
Likely a Two Shot Explosive Shotgun.
---
Many Explosive perk weapons can do this though.
---
My Explosive Fletchette Harpoon gun does the same thing.
---
I like duplicate perk cards so I can have say, a level three perk and a level 2 perk of the same type to use to fine tune my build.
---
I will pay you 20k. I will pay you 1st then you can drop mask as long as I can see it 1st.
---
Oh ok ty
---
Great, thank you! Now I can use power armor!
---
Not ignoring bad things. I dont use v.a.t.s at all when I did it worked 50 percent of the time at point blank r.i.p I dont know alot about the workshop plans since I already build my camp to my liking so I havent branched of into the building since. The game is not complete I get it and well the I only disconnect or bug out once a play session maybe 2 and if I do I can just reload it and it works fine.  Maybe it's just me? I do get crazy lag and frame drops as soon as I load into the world for maybe 15 -30 seconds. And yes I get frame drops randomly but my game stopped crashing after the December patch  usually when it freezes I'm like fuck it's going to crash then more than half the time it doesnt 
---
Who sits down and THEN closes the door?
---
Step 1 - Don't buy in-game items for real money you losers.
---
Step 2 - There is no step 2....lol
---
I actually was too but I was in there a while and someone was outside when I was done I thought it was cause if that
---
Who is mena?
---
Tasty scorched excrement. 
---
Camp Venture 
---
Who are u to tell others how to play the game they payed for?
---
Great idea
---
why do people prefer pump over combat? only level 36 but in my experience the combat shotgun does more damage and has a better rate of fire/ammo capacity. 
---
Junk collectors only get raw gear, springs and screws and acid, nothing you can junk further.  But get a junk node, I am sitting on tons of screws and springs.  Makes crafting for mods so much easier.
---
&gt;Step 2 - There is no step 2....lol
---
Crap, How do I do this step?
---
Maybe that the capacity is 3? Because when you go to collect the cores, it says 0/3 (or 1/3, whatever) for the weight limit. I’ve thought that as well. 
---
I havent the slightest idea
---
Those are rookie numbers I have 4 !!!  /s
---
So basically it's this....if there's a little yellow flare effect and you hear a "tss" for a second, it's an explosive weapon.
---
If you pair these with explosive perks, the damage gets stupid. And this is AOE damage, mind, so a room full of stuff is going to DIE.
---
If you further pair this effect with Two-shot, Instigating or Bloodied (risky - I speak from experience), nothing...NOTHING...survives the first shot.
---
Welcome to the "I either love or hate TSEs, and either have or have one, but might or might not want one, and do or don't want them to be nerfed into the ground" club.
---
I'm deaf, mute, and blind.
---
Please don't talk to, gesture at, or ask me questions.
---
One under the road to Watoga is nice.  2 sides to it, immune to to SB.
---
that's what he said genius. "players chipping away at your health".
---
I think it should do a half sized nuke explosion and nuke zone, and he instant when you cut the wrong wire
---
Wasn't this an option in fo4? I remember something like right click would do that on terminals and your pip boy
---
I found a few and both dropped legendary items, so I think you probably just had some bad luck or maybe killed them too fast. I think if you one shot a legendary it gives you less chance to get an item. They have to go through the fully heal from half health stage I think. But I could be wrong. The few legendaries that dropped nothing for me was when I killed them with one hit and maybe they hadn't spawned or started to move yet. Could be something like that.
---
The only real ways of fighting it are not participating, and reporting people you know are doing it. But the latter is nearly impossible to prove without hard evidence pointing towards an account name/gamertag/PSN ID.
---
Yeah the posts I saw were old which had me wondering if they fixed it.  But I couldn't find any mention.  Thanks for confirming.
---
Started playing yesterday also and was expecting players to go mess with me but everyone I ran into either waved at me or ignored me. I was pleasantly surprised. So far, Im loving this game.
---
I play with friends. We always have something to do and we all farm the queen as well. Solo gets boring adter everything is finished but friends in fallout are great.
---
You can get your team to kill you and you'll lonly lose half your caps
---
I've had mine bug out a few times.  Couldn't pick up the items, couldn't place them.
---
Never done it since....lol
---
Maybe a while later down the road.
---
...said literally everyone who liked using a broken OP thing in any game, ever. Right before it got nerfed into the ground.
---
guess when that time comes I will open up another game I got for xmas... Farcry 5 and then maybe that VR Tank game
---
the one with an assaultron near it about halfway to the trainyard I've got marine armour plans there multiple times while trying to get the BOS officer uniform plan
---
I still hear general household rumble or people talking to themselves/friends on discord, phones, etc. Guess not everybody got the memo about push to talk being a thing
---
Ive maxed caps from a couple weeks of vendor routes and now i can fast travel as i please knowing i can top off caps looking for plans and mods
---
Also, if you use a computer terminal it can be used to flip all switches that are connected to it. But you can lock terminals so they have to be hacked.
---
I don’t think either of those guns can have recon scopes.
---
what platform are you playing on?
---
I'd be happy just to start by getting a guaranteed leveled 3-star legendary every time I help kill the SBQ. BTW, I'm pretty sure I dealt the killing blow to her last night....feels good man. It was i hit to her snout with a Furious Super Sledge with +40% Power Attack damage - I was in my excavator power armor at the time.
---
What's wrong with that? There's tons of dead raiders all over the place.
---
No, some weapons just have different leveling.  10-50, 15-45.  If you get a 45 or 50 level item, it's probably the max level for that item.
---
👀
---
First time is somewhat difficult and confusing if you go in blind like I did having no idea what to expect e.g not watching YouTube how to videos but well worth the effort. Just watch out for those damn turrets.
---
I have my camp set up next to one and never noticed! You can pick up junk from the ground surrounding it though
---
It comes down to preference, and the real problem for me is that I don't really want to engage in a dialogue that way when I'm playing,   But I also don't want to be rude when people have a simple request.
---
Cept I can never find a vendor that has caps when I need to sell and I end up throwing it away because I have to pick between it or other mats,ammo or weapons I need.
---
We destiny now
---
Using a large amount of Nuka Cola Quantums will crash the game for some reason.
---
Platform: XBOX ONE
---
"is anyone else a braindead simp, because i am. bethesda shit in my mouth and i love it"
---
So... wear the base dress *and* the vault suit to get +3? The issue with the Tattered Dress is it goes in the cosmetic slot, but it provides a +1 to Perception, something no other cosmetic items do.
---
I totally agree and don’t grasp how people defend PvP in this game. It’s on par if not worse than Rust. Rust is all about, when I played, medium gameplay sessions and having groups of friends who maybe would take shifts defending their base cause the entirety of the game is just building fighting and destroying, it’s essentially Fortnite with no time limit. It was okay there because it was an isolated experienced focused on PvP.
---
Fallout is not that, not even when this iteration has heralded itself as online it isn’t designed for PvP it was just taken and thrown in. There’s no real benefit to be an aggressive player and there’s no real benefit to being a pacifist defender. It’s more or less down to what’s fun for you, and since pacifists have no way to just be left out of combat or base destruction you get these tense not fun anger inducing game sessions where some people are having fun wrecking you and you’re just trying to do a quest or something. It needs some serious reworking.
---
I love all of these ideas.
---
What if you attached it to a terminal? That doesn't let you change the song? 
---
gotcha just luck of the draw then haha (i really hate that) . Makes me wonder though if there's a similar event to patrol duty for armor schematics, hopefully not as cancerous though.
---
You are correct. I have 43 unspent perk points but I still go up a level. Although, I don't remember if this plays out differently under level 50 or not.
---
Farming for gear and weapons and plans for mut serums.. stuff like that
---
Did you aim for the middle of the DMV?
---
Maybe I missed something but both PC and console require internet for Fallout 76 - what bill you mean - for things like PS+?
---
Trying to get all plans and mods for everything.
---
Seems like that quest is bugged. Mine randomly shot up to 7/10 one day when I logged on. Then later was completed. Must have killed hundreds before it registered anything, and then seemingly all at once. 
---
Right so one shoting a a lvl80 Scorchbeast with melee isnt broken but these big bad tse are baby killers
---
Usually a critic reviews material and then walks away from it... not reviews it and then obsessively makes two more additional videos on how bad it is. Perhaps he's less interested in professionalism and more interested in harvesting clickbait from lovers and haters alike.
---
But what do I know I don't have a YouTube channel with millions of viewers, a nasally disgusting voice, a build like the blob from the X-Men, or the mentality of a 13 year old virgin.
---
Doing events, PVPing, trading on the FO76 Bazzar / FO76 Market reddits.  Haven't even done 25% of the story quests, so there's still that left to do.
---
Tonight is treasure map night.  Going to load up on some +luck chems to see if I can get better plans.  Friends are coming along too.
---
While most games let you experience the story, fallout 76 lets them tell you all the cool things that happens, while simultaneously breaking lore. Id rather just experience the fun things myself.
---
All good ideas but I'd also like to say that it would be good to have some endgame content that doesn't have a prerequisite like nuking an area or triggering some long string of events.  
---
Basically just a handful of dungeons that offer a variety of enemies in decent concentrations.  
---
West-tek research is one area that is close to what I have in mind, as it's chocked full of levelled super mutants but larger and with a guaranteed 3 star legendary at the end.  
---
It would be great to have the dungeons have monster themes like super mutant, mirelurks, scorchbeasts, etc etc.
---
it would solve about 1/3 of the posts asking that question
---
I cant make up my mind now that ive got covert operative, action boy, marathoner maxed out on which cards to invest in 
---
Okay, so sending a direct message to someone who hasn't initiated that kind of communication seems to step over that boundary a touch. Their play style then encroaches upon mine.
---
I've been hunting for Pocketed/Deep Pocketed plans for Combat Armor as well, I have not seen them anywhere, but I'm also on PC. Glad to hear that the do actually exist
---
maybe they were cheating?
---
4 hours of server hopping before I had all the plans.
---
Have you listened to the tapes/read the terminal notes? It is pretty clear why the decorations were left though I am unsure why the bots wouldn't have cleaned up.
---
Well now that’s some faulty logic. How does one thing being OP excuse something else that’s also OP?
---
The correct answer is they both get nerfed.
---
Never seen them before now. Was half in/out the door all sort fresh like. Just been killed. 
---
Don’t drop that yellow cake! 
---
Thank you thank you :D!
---
Level 77 and I've never seen one.
---
Poke around here and you'll see the latest theory is that it's all a simulation..welcome to Bandersnatch.
---
I'm not 100% how it works, but it doesn't work immediately. Like, they don't immediately disappear from the game. You can't see them or they you, on the map. But if you quit out of the game and come back on, they won't be in your world. They stay on the server, they just won't pop in to your world loads. ....I think
---
Made a crafting character and trying to find every plan and recipe 
---
Go to top of the world, or any ski resort, or ant raider Outpost in the Savage divide, or the raider controlled train stations, and you will see plenty of dead raiders.
---
Steel and lead is also easily acquired with excavator armor in various mines.
---
Scorched.
---
I found the DPC chest doing the Line in the Sand event. 
---
On the other hand, if the explosions on the cars are also lessened to the same extent, think about what a freeway pileup would’ve been like.
---
Crafting them is extremely affordable if you're able to drop nukes easily.
---

Check it out.
---
I'll settle for at least lvl 50.  Who said anything about tse?  I'm just looking for a decent gauss or rifle that's level 50.   Not something a third of the level below what I killed.  
---
I'm still fairly new to the game about lvl 18 but why is it a problem to use this gun in a nuke zone? I've never seen such a weapon or been in a nuke zone so I'm just curious why it seems to upset people
---
Wear the tattered dress, like all the other Mistresses did (the ones you find scattered around). Then you get the Mistress of Mysteries look, minus the ugly ruffle, plus you get to wear your underarmor and armor of choice, and you get the advantage of wearing the only cosmetic outfit in the game that has a stat bonus.
---
yeah, your not kidding. And every single time it happens its the same error code if my PS4 even collect the crash dump, anymore for me my PS4 freezes when trying to collect the error information so then I have to unplug it.
---
Till they fix this or even if they don't fix it I would say always treat Whitesprings and Fissure Site Prime as constant nuke zones. Never go to these areas without PA or hazmat
---
Pretty easy to get Nuke white Springs farm ghouls for 5 waves then farm flux for the rest of time comes in handy for many end game items.
---
I think that the majority of people are nice, and just want to play the game. I look at it the same way that I look at people who talk crap about a new phone when it comes out, the small amount of naysayers is only a fraction of the people who are playing/bought said device or game, the majority of people are happy and see no reason to post " Hey I love this game" or " Hey this game is ok"
---
It's balanced fine imo, you make all items equal and you have no progression with the game. I would be more for increasing monster difficulty in high level areas 
---
Getting the error "you lack the components to fabricate this item" when i try to complete blade of Bastet on Novice of Mysteries quest. I have the sword in my inventory with swing analyzer attacjed to it.

**Start trading on FO76 Bazzar and FO76 Market reddits.  If you're good at it, you make crap tons of caps.**  I regularly get up to 20,000+ caps, then go on a buying spree down to 5,000.  Sell more, back to 20,000.
---
I don't even sell to the vendors anymore.  Not worth the fast travel time / caps....lol  The only time I'll sell to a vendor is if I'm standing right next to one and have some garbage on me :)
---
I bought it yesterday and loving it.
---
Yes I do and I’m level 40. I just need some 5mm ammo
---
yea same here 
---
How tf did this get downvoted? 
---
I'm writing fan fiction about this comment.
---
Becauae of lehendaries and experience. If you dont hit enemies at least once you wont get experience or legendary drops. Most of the time you wont get anything if they have been one shot by someone not on your team. 
---
And if you’re a higher level if you have any weapons that may be of use to me. I’ll take them
---
You guys made my day with these replies. This community is great &lt;3 I'm glad so many others were looking for new friends too :D 
---
yea I saw a few rumors about it and different Reddit post but never a clip
---
I wish there was hand scanner doors.  So you could put those in and anyone on your team could open them FROM BOTH SIDES plz.....lol
---
"The Explorer"... it's a new and scary world out there, but someone has to map it....
---
I really do wish that they allowed us to set up trading posts.  I'd end up being like the Hudson's Bay company, with trading posts in every backwater town. 
---
I dont know, that's pretty high hopes... 
---
Doesn't the game count that as a theft and place a bounty on the player who "stole" the items?
---
I'd love to have some crops and water set up for the people who happen by my C.A.M.P. but I keep it all locked up so a new person doesn't accidentally get a bounty on themselves.
---
Fallout Christmas, i call it.... something something, nuclear winter...
---
I may sell another one let me see about it once I get on later I would be willing to do recipe instead of caps too
---
I find you can be prone to spray and miss half the time with combat shotguns.
---
Plus I do believe Pump action has slightly better range.
---
It's just that this person wasn't there earlier, I was just cleaning up the area and found him/her.
---
Sometimes an individual server will shut down for maintenance. Are you unable to connect to a new one?
---
I dont mind to play with you but I wont give away stuff either. Already tried that before and people keep asking for more and more. I make my ammo like everyone else. 
---
I've only ever encountered one
---
The perk card "feature" is an absolute chore, at best. It is neither fun nor intuitive. They need to provide a way for players to easily swap, pre-defined decks during game play or make passive cards a zero point cost with minimum requirements tied to the ability (ex. 3/6/9 Perception for the different levels of Pick Lock).
---
I have all serum recipes. 
---
I can also solo the silos as well
---
So farm SBQ.  If you can't solo the silos, then it's not a snooze.
---
The chainsaw is worse than the R.I.P.per I mean it's not the best in fallout 4 but damn is it fun. 
---
I think it's 3 per hour and the max storage is also 3.  So wait an hour and it should be full.
---
I'd love some passive perk slots.  I really hate wasting points on non-combat perks.  After they do that, rebalance to adjust for the increased damage everyone is doing, done ez.
---
For the 10th time this week, wandering around wondering why I'm not rekt face killing mobs, then realize half of my damage cards are set to crafting cards.
---
Yup. I'm completely out. 
---
I run around and smash stuff as a time killer and something to do. I've also been hunting for better Legendary weapons, just for fun. Also I haven't done a lot of the Events and such so I have been going back and doing those, also Treasure Maps, I need to go through the ones I've got.
---
I think there is enough to keep me occupied till we see some sort of expansion/DLC/New Quests or whatever Bethesda plans on tossing our way
---
Cant stand when people do this, not to mention its a complete waste of time if you don't hit anything since turret kills grant you nothing.
---
I also recommend power armor.  There are folks who have done amazing builds with unarmed and no power armor, but those are pretty advanced builds.
---
i don't think i've lost anything but when i logged in on Tuesday i had gained 20 frag grenades and frag mines. 
---
We're all circling the drain when it comes to MoM items. 
---
Nah, only counts if they pick a lock or damage property. I hit up unlocked water purifiers all the time.
---
While there are a lot of Bugs, they have been fixing them. Right now the game is unstable because of people exploiting bugs for their benefit. But that does not mean I cannot play for a few hours without issue. Sometimes a sever hop is all it takes
---
What platform are you on. He’s probably have done that due some perks and he might have been doing a crap ton of damage 
---
If you aren't going to use the nuke you can shoot them in the arm and it will explode
---
Online game*. There are no rp servers so asking people not to message you is probably asking to get spammed.  Where as just not answering messages while playing is a simpler and makes you less of a target for trolls.
---
I'm never sure if my mic is working or not. Sometimes it works in game and then quits for no reason. Though I did have a chat with some guy referring to himself (I think?) In 3rd person. He was a lvl 40 something guy running away from a lvl 80 scorch beast in the Watoga area. In was so surprised when he responded!
---
What is a TSE weapon?
---
Damn, you'd think the fabricator would spit you out a new one if you lost the first one.
---
Maybe it spawned in late? Or it was thrown by an explosion? Or you just didn't see it when you first passed. All of the raider bodies are preplaced in the world.
---
If you're implying you think it was a living npc, that's just not possible.
---
I don't know xbox but maybe there is a way to turn of messaging in settings. Because I can tell you one thing for sure. Posting here is gonna do Jack shit about your problem. Probably just make it worse.
---
I like the Mr handy with the cats.
---
I've thrown grenades and lol'd @ dead NPCs cartwheeling through the air that i didn't know were in my target zone before. Maybe somebody displaced him.

While GTA has its issues with passive mode, I would love it if Fallout had this with a little bit of tweaking. I also come from survival games, I played a shit ton of Ark but Ark was focused on both PVP and PVE so it made sense. For Fallout to be so heavily based on PVE, the players who are strictly here for the PVE need to be left alone because the amount of thought that appears to be put into PVP is next to none.
---
Thinking about it now, nukes should be RNG too. :D imaginr the fun we would have dropping nukes only to have them not blow up :D
---
Your example is totally different tho. It would be more accurate with two neurosurgeons, one of them has outdated knowledge and the other knows the currently used better methods. pick one
---
What level you at? Could be Interesting to compare the better bonuses we are both getting from it. 
---
I’m sure I’m no longer getting a strength boost from mine. Perhaps that’s how it should be, or it’s a bug
---
Yeah, a lot of them feel less like perks that enhance gameplay, but rather "tolls" that I need to pay in order to play the game less hindered. I want to fight things, build things, and explore. Many of the perks I'm using are simply meant to allow me to do these three things with fewer interruptions, but aren't serving to enhance much.
---
Force close the game, the bout it back up. Should give you time when logging back in to do something. 
---
It really sucks how it works, it takes you off the map and them from yours, which isn't bad, I wish it made me invisible to them and my camp. If you talking about the session one.
---
if you switch worlds, potentially they can follow you if they want. I make sure I blocked them on XB1 as well, so they will never see me again. I wish the block was better than it is now.
---
Nuking Whitesprings 
---
I was so confused for a second when I came across him. I passed up on rad rat steak in the hopes someone else would run across him.
---
Exactly, if you're hiking across a mountain range hauling 200lb of equipment for hours on end you're going to drink a ton of water and burn a ton of energy.
---
I'd question why you're using either if you're not doing a sniper set up. 
---
Think you'd be better served with a combat or handmade rifle personally. 
---
In the same boat as you. All I really care about is plans i dont have. Once i find them and pimp out all the PA i want with jetpacks, Ill probably be done. Nukes got boring for me a long time ago, since i have basically a statistically accurate 0% chance of ever getting better loot than i have (Quad 3star handmade/Explosive combat rifle).
---
How do you give somebody a power armor chassis? When I try to "drop" one it actually places it for me to climb into and I'm assuming other players can't enter it. If I leave it there it magically goes back into my inventory.
---
i dont use the auto reciever for ammo conservation purposes but i should check on the range. my combat shotgun range is garbage. I just picked up an instigating, limb damage 2 shot which i've been using but the reload kills me and the range is garbage there too. I'm mostly melee and would really like a solid ranged option but i just dont know if shotgun is it for me. 
---
I met someone yesterday who messaged me and asked for help getting to Level 45.  They were at 42 when they messaged me.
---
They said, *"I'm trying to get to where I can use this gun I found.  It looks good, but maybe it's not.  I'm not sure.  Should I keep it or sell it?"*  He/she sent me a screenshot.  It was a Level 45 TSE Lever Rifle.  
---
I wish I were enough of an asshole to convince him to sell it to me for 100 caps.  Alas, I told him it was a good gun and if he didn't want it, I'd take it.  He chose to keep it.  When he finally got to Level 45 and used the gun, he fell in love instantly.  Rats.
---
yea i defiantly accidentally sold mine as well :(
---
would be nice to be able to re-craft it, if you lose it, or did the order of mysteries at a really low level 
---
If only there were reasons to try and find this stuff. Or reasons to launch nukes. Or reasons to kill the queen. Or anything, really. 
---
I can hear this text 
---
Mutate faster?
---
I agree and it makes me frown! FO76 has enough lore issues. Leave the good Super Mutants alone :(.
---
The somerset special can be used against level 40 mole miners pretty reliably, any shotgun can also do work if you can get the ammo for it which isn't too bad 
---
"I am sick. I will punch a baby bear in his shit."
---
I’ve had her tell at least three different stories, and you always get a little bit of loot as a reward for listening.
---
Here's a thread all about the under armor stats and crafting and such. The only 2 shielded linings that can be had reliably are for the Vault 76 jumpsuit (hope you kept it!), and the enclave under armor. The enclave you'll need to buy all 4 levels of the lining sequentially. Once you have shielded you'll be able to mod the enclave under armor.  
---

---
Because as far as I know and have seen the mask is not something you can keep or have.
---
So far down haha. There’s dozens of us! 
---
Because this is laughable to most people here away from the trading subs.
---
There's active listings for this thing over there.
---
Last time that happened to me I literally stood next to him and turned in circles while jumping once per revolution out of boredom.
---
Some of them even help with carry weight
---
same :D
---
You can keep it. Go to YouTube 
---
Am usually on every day. Lv124, gt is exile matrix 
---
^^it's ^^a ^^joke
---
Ok. I'm back on. What was that about?....it didn't JUST disconnect. It gave me the full on countdown, as if it was "Scheduled Maintenance."
---
Level up a different special and tab over to the intelligence cards
---
You're right.
---
Y'all can keep messaging me, It's fine. I'll just RP as a guy who doesn't respond to texts.
---
Since we're on the subject, am I the asshole for building behind the clubhouse but with zero turrets, two unlocked water purifiers, all benches open, a full garden, and no locked doors?
---
Yeah I approached her and she said " sorry, im only looking for someone to do scientific research " or something along those lines. 
---
\+1 for the title alone.
---
I've tried using PTT, but I don't think it's working. I'm wondering if the game is trying to use the wrong audio input on my PC. The Audio settings need the ability to configure a specific device and do some kind of test.
---
I was talking with a guy in area chat when it just quit. XBL was the only way I could chat with him as even after teaming up the team and area chats quit.
---
No issues on Xbox. Just logged on to test it after reading this post.
---
Yes- I often don’t choose to level up until I’m safely back home because I’d rather not leave myself open to those dicks who player kill to get their hardened mass 
---
Don't be a grump! 
---
In all seriousness, I hate when people 1 shoy. I'll sit there and eat hits as I frantically turn as if to say, "Dude! Dude! Ugh, DUDE!"
---
Agreed.
---
There is no paradox. Just a whole lot of distance between us, and any potential location of other intelligent life. So much distance, in fact, that we will likely never traverse it, and thus, will never discover that other life.
---
Though...invisible barriers which can apparently be crossed, but which are practically insurmountable, are a favorite method of open world game devs, and would make handy invisible bars to the cage like boundaries of any simulated environment. 
---
Don't also forget us PC players who prefer sitting back on the couch w/ a controller who don't get the option to keybind a PTT key for whatever reason.  We're just forced to be forever mute.
---
I’m in the same boat. 
---
Maybe if its around for 10 years or something.
---
I mean, its taken me ~7 years to hit 1500 hours in Civ V and I play that a lot.
---
If I'm having a NAT issue, it's an issue I have had with no other game, is all I'm saying
---
I just dont care about Scorch Beasts or their queen and there are no more pretty dresses. Overall, they capitalised on my tendency toward digital hoarding. I liked wandering and collecting but I've been just about everywhere and there's nothing else to do in the dead world, no one to meet, and no choices to make.  What's the point? 
---
buffout is my most used one... when it is time to port home and dump in the blue box.
---
*Atom's
---
This is really easy and will eventually happen on its own because of economics but sell your legendaries cheaper than what they currently go for. No one will pay 20 bucks or whatever for a TSE/BSS weapon or RW armor when they're going for like 2k caps
---
I was at a vendor for a good period of time without being aware there was someone waiting. I heard a cough and sure as hell there's someone there waiting to trade. I appreciated the polite cough as opposed to shit talking lol.
---
I mean why not? It's a way for them to add skins, items, etc. From other games and it be okay that it doesn't match up with the Canon Lore. 
---
Take 2 more rank 1s and don’t combine them when prompted. Then later on when your ready, you can combine them with the 3 rank you already own. 
---
Never seen plans or the handmade rifle itself. Is there a specific place where it can be found or purchased?
---
I use the hunting rifle more at mid range, damage wise what if the difference between them. I like having the ability to one shot lower level creatures at mid range but cant stand big sniper scopes.
---
Start/ join a community and build a mini city with camps
---
They did it on fallout 3???
---
Not at all. It's open property. The only theft is breaking into things that are locked. The game doesn't let you actually steal from people's stash or inventory. Whatever is out in the world is fair game
---
Trying not to be :)
---
I’m looking for a group to drop my first bike with too! Would love to join your group sometime! Gt:capnmattttt. level 60
---
And a Merry Christmas to you as well! 
---
(really though, the Brotherhood and Enclave haven't really actually encountered each other yet in the Fallout time line, so their relationship is up to the players :)) 
---
I have a little over 5000 hours in dota 2. Took me around 4 years. I game alot but that's not going to happen anytime soon for anybody.
---
This. You don’t have to take the perk card in the same category you level up in; that’s just the default card category. 
---
SAME bro, same. They just don't want to admit it. It is like a virus at this point you don't even know you could have something duped.  
---
There is nothing wrong with having TSE weapons or duped items, just stop romanticizing the fact that we all have them and it is FUCKING OK.
---
I haven't launched a nuke myself yet, but just out of curiosity, if you nuke Whitesprings and someone's CAMP is in the blast zone, do you get a wanted level for damaging it?  Or do nukes not count toward giving you a wanted level?
---
 Only barn doors I've seen are the smaller wooden doors and the outhouse doors with the moon cutout. 
---
I'm not one to usually complain, but after the fifth time of my game freezing on the queen when she's below a quarter health is wearing my patience thin. At least freeze up at the beginning so I'm not wasting my ammo for nothing!
---
Yeah I can do that but how do I get the two level 1’s? 
---
I can, but the recipes are so pricey.
---
Right? Aaaaand the BOS seems to be the nicer, protect humanity type that they were in FO3. 
---
You might keep an eye on the train stations around the mansion to see if sells one after finishing the quest- lot of christmas noobs would just now be getting around to that questline.
---
Don’t forget to loot and server hop!
---
Whitesprings has been nerfed twice so I doubt they'll hit it again instead of buffing other places
---
Dude I know! If you do the math it'll take 633 days (If you play for 12 hours a day) that's nutty! Even worse, the atom reward is like 20 or 40 atoms! Now that's laughable
---
That fucker has jumped scared me so many fucking times. Being all sneaky stalking a three star mirelurk queen and he just rolls up behind you.
---
Yeah.. It only goes up to 60%. Rank 3 of each card is 20%. Rank one of each is 10%, then rank 2 and 3 are both plus 5%. That's why rank one of each is better than rank 3 of one. 
---
Oh ok fair enough that sounds frustrating I'll keep that in mind once I get there not to be that guy
---
I don't know how many hours I have in the game, but I'm at Level 102 currently.  I'm still saving the final mission, mostly to have something I haven't done yet.  I haven't finished all of the Events yet either, or tried all of the mutations yet.
---
Lately I've been helping a low level friend explore, while mowing through enemies to sell their stuff and slowly make my way toward 25,000 caps.  I'm still enjoying it.  Like you said, I really like "just being in the Fallout universe."  So I'm content for the moment, but also looking forward to new content soon.
---
Like the other guy said... probably just working on multiple servers in your region perhaps. Nonetheless it is bullcrap and I feel your frustration. 
---
PS4? You can have mine. 
---
The presence of oil in the car is probably it running like a steam engine using the reactor as the source for heating water. It still operates similar to an internal combustion engine and needs lubrication for moving parts. 
---
Yup, Ultra Light also visibly changes the look of the armor, like on combat armor arms, the big shoulder bits are actually removed when you make them ultra light.  Although on chest I always put asbestos lining if it's available, just cause fuck dots
---
I was thinking more outside the game. I can't even concieve of getting evidence of such activity in game. Dupers sure. But RMT is super hard to prove in game.
---
Mental note: have Ride of the valkyries blasting through the mic on area to see who is listening
---
Freedom Fighters only because the mire is absolutely beautiful 
---
 In before I walk into a camp with a bunch of pictures of penises and swastikas 
---
Ya this doesn't make sense since you could kill something for a billion XP and you'll only gain one LVL.
---
when teamed, with some having mic set to team, or area it can cause issues, everyone on team needs to use the same setting
---
Calm yourself sourpuss, it's just abit of friendly info, move on if you don't like it. 
---
Yeah, on your next level up, pick you special, then when you get to the perk card screen, use your right/left bumpers, you can pick cards from a different special.
---
It wouldn’t be so bad if they had good stuff to buy. I often sell and get 200 caps and then I could sell more but they have nothing worth buying. More plans would be super nice.  Maybe even some of the harder resources to acquire. 
---
Nice to finally get an answer on this confirming it one way!
---
Time to set up some outside, unlocked, stuff for randoms.
---
honestly, your in more danger in the parking lot for a certain mall than these things.....accidently missed a scorched once and hit a car with my Anti Armor The Dragon....was super lucky to have the perk on for auto stim use at low hp and life saving trapper right arm
---
I put a week into 3 and New Vegas, only 4 days into 4. 
---
I'm at about 20 hours with 76, 19 of which have been inventory management! 
---
It only holds 14 at a time that really isn't that many but it would be a good supplemental to farming.  Plus the rate could be adjusted for different items.
---
I don't buy any plans anymore because of having no preview image! The amount of mislabeled plans is aggravating
---
Maybe its because the game is shit and the engine is over 20 years old. Eh? 
---
How did you get a cap stash as a placeable object??
---
Well I am currently just messing with my build. Since im maxed out on perk trades and such at level 170ish it gives me a reason to level. Not sure how many levels to get every card but I may try to do that at some point. I farm queen right now for plans, and eat the plans instead of sell them, only selling my duplicates, so Im basically trying to learn all the plans in game. Also farming steel to make armor to get mods for armors I wear to max my DR. I also need some armor and weapons I dont have yet.
---
I also move camps every few days. I tend to try to find interesting/challenging spots to build. So far Ive built on the highest point in the world, at carhenge, way high up in a train car in the bog, and currently am building a treehouse in the swamp. Ive learned alot about how to build camps/roofs and tips/tricks to place things how you want.
---
I spend time trading here and there as well.
---
I mean like pictures from the photomode
---
I'm pretty sure it's just there so you can keep track of play time (since I don't see a counter of that anywhere else). 7600 hours is ridiculous. If you kept your game on 24/7 and never had any power, system, or connection issues, it would still take close to a year. 
---
No. My point is that being able to learn even things you don't care about, is a skill and a choice that is being tested. You don't think that the several thousands of residency applicants I get a year all really loved learning ochem in college or biostatistics in med school do you? Its boring as fuck. Its exactly that it's boring and you still learn it and perform well with it that shows me that you will be a good physician. 
---
That being aside. I have no idea where you even started down the path of thinking its a question of outdated knowledged. My example is of a specific branch of deep cortical artery that arises from the posterior cerebral artery. This position has not changed in human history. If I mentioned for instance how acute appendicitis can be submarined instead of always operated on or that statins can be maintained without interval check of FLP, then maybe it's a matter of new vs old information. Its quite odd you found your way there.
---
If you can hook up a fusion generator to it and heavy defences around the generator, fusion core generator and workshop, and manage to stay connected for a few hours (my PS4 seems to glitch out every couple of hours or so), it really pays out with charged fusion cores. Tbh thunder mountain is a pain in the rear end. Monongah is much easier to defend. 
---
Any idea why people build their camps there? Do they just throw molotovs at mobs, let the turrets kill 'em all, and pick up the loot?
---
I might delete the junk resource gatherer in my base and just pick up the scrap myself, save some budget
---
Wait till you find the perfectly preserved Lady Ranger that seemingly just died... shit irked me good cuz we are left to believe she died the moment our vault opened. 
---
Moved, didn’t work
---
All of this please.
---
Have you considered possibly looking up a map of which vendors are where?
---
Like, you realize you're complaining about not being able to get enough caps for yourself conveniently, and asking Bethesda to lower the amount of total caps available from vendors a day by almost 2/3 from everyone else, just so they're more conveniently accessible to you?
---
Moved it multiple times. No fix
---
Exactly admittedly I even have a photo mode pic of someone’s rainbow light pens
---
Not everyone here attends the trading sub's. Doesn't mean they're not willing to trade.
---
Only makes them non hostile to you, they still attack other things, found this out by pacifying to try and help my low level friend get hits on nuke zone ghouls to power level....they don't become neutral to any one but the one doing the pacify
---
Ehhh, that's debatable. The BoS has been know to harass civilians and responders for supplies. 
---
Good enough reasoning for me. I would like to see lore on this if there is any. Interesting stuff. 
---
leave them alone...
---
I thought it should be worth a lot disappointed to find it was worth almost nothing. After all no one is making more toilet paper soooo it's limited supply
---
Idk I don’t know how to get a terminal plan
---
It isn't, it totally respawns, like all the chems and other cool goodies inside!
---
I just use it as a way to see how many hrs I've played. I don't expect to get those 20 atoms lol
---
Same. I keep waiting for something to pop up that I just NEED to have. I feel like if I finally spend my atoms they'll release something somewhat cool right after. 
---
You can pick up the junk with a resource extractor on you you get double 
---
Ridiculous, any "evidence" there could be pointing towards you being in a simulation is meaningless since the very fact that you're in a simulation would mean everything you "know" and all your experiences could be entirely fabricated making that "evidence" invalid in the first place.
---
I was carrying around 3 of them for a while in I ended up dropping them though lol
---
I've been looking for unmarked locations, rechecking old places for holotapes, playing around with cooking and working on a good route to make a regular pile of good food, doing challenges for atoms and fun, collecting caps 'til I max out and buy all the plans, and most of all playing around with camps. 
---
I took my time with quests and exploration and had a second character that I had abandoned halfway through... I'm kinda itching to start a new character to play with guns since mine is currently melee... Plus there's always the fun of finding legendary monsters scattered around. 
---
I can't put my finger on exactly what makes this game so fun to me but it just is... I'm also very eager to see what new content comes along. 
---
It's not a perfect game and I'm not gonna play it forever but it's definitely my winter jam and I've definitely got my monies worth as a day 1 full priced buyer. 
---
I could totally understand people losing interest after doing most the content but the game just clicked with me. 
---
Fax
---
this is the correct answer. 
---
You, and I cannot state this emphatically enough, and a bona fide Hero.
---
Oh maybe just two shot vs regular is exactly double, but explosive to double explosive is not directly 2x damage
---
I'm not being being sour, just stated my opinion, the reactions are amusing though.  I'm sour because I didn't find the information useful?  I should move on rather than express an opposing view?  You poor kids... You don't even know.
---
Thanks for sharing! I had heard about that car before but forgot about it. Sucks that everyone got scared of nuclear power and all of these concepts went out the window, although it would be very unsafe. Haha 
---
I find them completely useless. First, I only run 1 point in Perception. Second, I have all the hacker ones from perk packs and I just don't care. You never get anything worthwhile.
---
I think by worst he means that its dark/intense, not that it's a poorly written quest.
---
Im looking for one N of Prickets Fort. found a note on a random encounter dead raider and it was imploring people to come to a local cave where they had food and water.
---
Find me 1 video?
---
I use padded for the chest.. its somewhat important for me to avoid getting blown up by my buddy smashing all the cars he sees
---
Are you saying that in 25 years the overseer didn't make a single close friend who she could talk to about her plan to get her husband? And are you saying the best and brightest wouldn't decide (quite sensibly) that they'd  be better off sticking together, even if they hated eachother? Also, where are all the vault kids? Or did Bethesda also shove in an excuse for that so that they could manufacture a perfect scenario in which a bunch of adults in a vault leave it to find no one in the wilderness and turn on eachother?
---
I'm not saying that the story of 76 is broken. I'm sure there are excuses for every problem with it. My point is that you wouldn't need all these excuses if you had a sensible start e.g. a refugee, BOS prisoner, ex raider, or something similar. Maybe the player can choose exactly how and why they're in west Virginia. It would make for some much better roleplaying without all these excuses for why a bunch of vault dwellers suddenly get out and turned on eachother while the overseer ran out 
---
And then people complain that Stimpaks are being retconned because they cannot regenerate entire new limbs or something.
---
Are  this codes for right now 
---
Farm plans, farm plants, complete quests, complete events, and build a camp worth retiring to
---
I bought the game to play with friends, we all play Fallout. Turns out we all play Fallout on different consoles. So Reddit is the friend I play with now
---
Recently I've been scouting magazines and bobbleheads with the perception perks. There are close to 100 mags to hunt if you're into that. Also been working on finding / learning every plan I can.
---
Can you get duplicate normal cards? I dont mind getting the golden one, but normally that would suck. I have not gotten extras for any that had the "full house" 1 2 and 3
---
I agree completely. Wipe my character. For whatever reason, and I'm packing up. There is a vast difference between a forced wipe and a replay. Force wiping is basically saying "fuck that piece of your life you've devoted to the game", especially one with as janky a system as FO76.
---
My squad don't dupe but we have produced duplicate items through no fault of our own. As I said before I've drunk and given away a Lot more purified water than I have ever picked up. I know I gave my squad mate all my diluted stims yet in the SBQ battle I still had all of them. How does one control a system that does stuff like that and only punish "bad" dupers?
---
Are TSEs over powered? Probably. But I've solo farmed the golf club house with both my single explosive Gattling and my M2. It doesn't require TSE. But in the same vein the SBQ and the tightly packed gouls in the club house shouldn't shake off a Fatman Mini nuke going off in their midst.
---
I believe you can get a +42% XP boost -

Well Rested (bed) +10%

Bobblehead Leader +5%  
---
Cranberry Juice +2%
---
I do this all the time with lone wanderer and hard bargain, only realise when I get my face smashed in abit too fast. 
---
There's a few dead vault 76 people scattered around too. It's normal.
---
That simply means you have not collected all the things.
---
I got all of my black titanium in the lab and basement of Hornwright industries, it's just laying around, didn't have to farm a single moleman or deathclaw for them
---
On the topic of TSE weapons.
---
* Love em.
---
* Have em. (Like a lot of them)
---
* Think they're OP.
---
* Bethesd please nerf.
---
I use the emoticon to wave at others and then signal to come over then drop excess junk.  If they come over and look at it, I'll then drop extra weapons, etc. 
---
I've traded with people when my caps were low, but I mostly just give stuff away now that I'm at level 50+. 
---
Thank you mate, but the way I say things its quite choking for some people, it is because my personality (hard to handle) and the fact that I am not English and translating things could ruin the way you or any other person could understand it, but still I try to make my post active and not be a dick, except for those who friking deserve it.
---
Anyone down to nuke the queen? 
---
You know, for what it's worth, I appreciate it. Because I wish I knew how long I have played Fallout 4 for. I'm just estimating. I'm sure it's over 1000 hours. But I play on Ps4. So, I'm unsure.
---
Yep. I have a level 45 set with calibrated shocks and the arm mods that increase unarmed damage, as well as the medic pump for the torso. I now run around and take out many enemies with just my fists and with the Talon's mutation the bleed damage usually finishes them off. If I log off while wearing the power armor and log back on, my carry weight is over 500.
---
I used to do work for an MMO years ago investigating and issuing bans for things like power leveling, gold selling/buying, and account trade/sale. It's such a hard thing to deal with because it's not explicitly illegal, just a violation of the EULA, so web hosts and the such don't really care enough to take action if it means losing a customer. The only sites that would really work with us were sites like Ebay, but even that was a pain in the ass at times. The only way we could address it was by getting lucky and catching an admission before the account was sold, or if they were dumb enough to post a character name and server publicly.
---
I am faced now several times crashing game when fast traveling to Top of the World's nearest train station. Two times when it has been loaded correctly I cannot see trading bot, and after that game crashes - again. What a Friday friyay indeed... (PC player) 
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
I got the lever action in Grafton, watoga for radium
---
I live like 2 blocks from Bethesda. lol what the hell.
---
That's exactly my point- I'm just assuming the answer to how it got downvoted is that the vast majority of people on the discussion boards don't participate in the cap economy for rare/duped stuff and think it's absurd that somebody would pay 20k for this.
---
Over there this is a legit ask and people are like "That's what this is worth? Cool." 
---
Sounds rough
---
I'm pretty sure the Tesla rifle doesn't have any random spread for the projectiles, or if they do it's bugged. I've seen two divergent arcs from my 2 shot tesla rifle one time, and haven't been able to replicate it. May have just been a visual glitch.
---
the look on Nielsen's face when she hands him the stuffed beaver is absolutely priceless... the man was an absolute genius when it came to facial expressions
---
It was never unplayable. If you can live with an occasional bug or a random disconnect here and there, I'd say get it now and dig in
---
Unless you have a TSE at level 25, absolutely not. 
---
Glad to be of help and you‘re welcome :)
---
I assume storing doesn’t create a copy but does a full respawn which will also resets the AI.
---
This however also means one can counter that perk card by simply storing and rebuilding turrets mid combat and turn the table on the attacker 
---
I got the game a few weeks ago but really started putting in time this week after my son got it. We have been having a lot of fun, no crashing, minimal lag. This is on the playstation.  It's a great game, I really don't understand the negativity. 
---
It’s not half as bad as made out to be. I purchased at Xmas and I have crashed about 3 times.
---
https://youtu.be/bODAHf2doRs
---
This doesn’t seem to work for me. Is this only PA pieces found in the wild? If I touch quest reward PA pieces that are higher level, it won’t let me re-add to PA frame.
---
I usually just unequip the card and everything goes back to normal
---
That's a great idea. I have the protocoled X-01 torso mod (speed and damage reduction buffs while under 20% health) and I could totally swap that on to my excavator power armor.
---
Nah man, not unless you want to die a lot. 
---
Perfect I will have to search for that, I wasnt aware.
---
I have the rifleman perk up to expert level so does that still work or would it be useless?
---
The one for nukacola is a good idea but I personally just drink inert Flux. It may weigh more but it is a handy way to get rid of it and it fills like 1/2 the bar. 
---
White Springs or Prime Nuke Zones + Well Rested + Leader Bobblehead + Cranberry food (or the other EXP ones). Stack a Tesla Rifle or something capable of tagging multiple enemies and you'll cruise through levels.
---
Yeah i notice this when a teammate leaves and suddenly i cant jump. Marsupial is my dad. 
---
&gt;Sell the house, sell the car, sell the kids, Im never coming back. Forget it.
---
Piercing capacitors, medium scope, suppressor. Stock depends on how much extra weight you want to add. IMO not really worth the extra weight, but aligned has the best stats. 
---
Ooh yeah it's awesome. Actually spent some time shooting the ghouls he mentioned in the first part.
---
Welcome the the run for your life club!!   
---
(AFAIK) It depends, if you are lucky to go on a server where you are the first to go to WhiteSpring, then enemies will spawn at your level (more or less), if a higher level player gets there, then levels will be higher.
---
Sorry doesn't tell you how you can keep it. Just talks about some goofy glitch the person found.
---
Honestly, I am not the biggest fan of how they redid the SPECIAL system. It’s neat that they add new attributes and all that but in my opinion more to select from just seems sloppy. The less to select from wasn’t dull, it was well crafted. 
---
I could tell they were based on 90s chatbots, but I didn't realize there was a specific reference there
---
I'm almost guaranteed a crash if I'm going through the weapons tab in my stash box. I don't even have that much. :/
---
When u go to selected perks for your current needs, you’ll see your level 3, and a level 1. Under the level 1 it will say 2 owned or something to show you have 2 of those cards. 
---
There are a lot of random stuff like that in pre designated spots, usually along roads. If you relog and run the the exact same spot there likely will be another random encounter
---
It's not stable; but I wouldn't call it the most unstable thing ever. 
---
I still wouldn't buy it at full price, *but*, I have enjoyed my time on it and do continue to play. The weight limit sucks, the quest bugs suck, the crashing...sucks. But it's playable. 
---
You ever play an EA game where it's not totally polished but is, generally, quite playable? That's Fallout 76. Or really any Bethesda game. 
---
So if you've bought any other Bethesda game within a year of launch, you know what to expect. 
---
Glad I know this know this now. Ended up selling some lvl25 because I didn't want to carry it, but fortunately it was just raider armor
---
Yeah, my first experience as a level 23 was just the other day. Just trying to pass through on a quest. Got my ass handed to me, in quick order. Didn’t even go back for the junk bag. 
---
Apologies. Two Shot Explosive.
---
There's nothing wrong with having an opinion, but when someone gives advice that helps people there's no need to be like "nah your wrong" 
---
But it does show proof that you can keep it.
---
Because it’s E3. You do know that things are subject to change 5 months before release right?
---
Psa these are the only places you can tame pets for your camp
---
76 has been the subject of alien experiments before. When the ast. CEO was kidnapped during its construction. Could the aliens be in control of the vault? Are we in the pods seen on mothership zeta?
---
This mod takes care of it for you on PC.  It doesn't actually install a mod if you're worried about that sort of thing, it just brings up a color picker and generates the .ini for you.

I’ve only got quest legendaries
---
The down side is when you open a perk pack and it gives you the fourt copy of a one star card that you’ve had an animated gold version of since level 50. I mean, cmon, Just pick one of the twenty that I don’t have.  
---
I’ve noticed this too.
---
for the daily quest: there is a shovel right next to the grave you have to bury the remains in. look around a bit.
---
Your skills at finding this thread and typing in full sentences is impeccable!
---
...wait a minute...
---
Thanks for the correction.
---
Thanks!   
---
I think there might be some problems with that spreadsheet though. I have 4 different .50cal receivers for my hunting rifles and Im sure I got one or two from scrapping hunting rifles.   
---
The spreadsheet lists the chance as "none". 
---
Well with distance like that, what’s keeping your from talking face to face!? 
---
Right?  
---
Yeah, unfortunately they don't do much damage against the enemies there. 
---
I have to say, and it makes no sense, but I first read your sentence "poney hot trap". And now I kinda want that to be a thing.
---
I got it for xmas too, and have been loosing lots of sleep over it.  the occasional crash or disconnect doesn't bother me that much, also on a PS4 not certain if it is all because of the SDD drive I got for xmas but reloading takes seconds.
---
I went there back when I was level 22.  
---
I'd kite the ghouls back to the robots and tag them for some quick xp.  
---
Just be careful and use the terrain to your advantage for quick escapes.
---
A TSE is a Two-Shot Explosive weapon, it is two stars or superior weapon  that shoots one extra shoot  (consuming just one) and the ammunition  explodes making AoE damage
---
Literally walk to them without retaliating; if they’re dumb enough, they’ll blow themselves up.
---
I was waiting for the other guy to come online. He said he would be down for a nuke run. 
---
As far as I could tell, the red dot on the gauss is not just obstructed by the suppressor, but also misaligned. IIRC you have to put the dot well below the target.
---
The mod selection is pretty good though, and even stock it has surprisingly good hipfire accuracy.
---
I agree. I also hate the fact that I have shitty perk cards from packs that I'll never use. So not only do I have to switch constantly, but that switching is made slower by flipping through 10 extra perk cards that are just there.
---
Your wish will be granted soon as player vendors will come with the next update 
---
See you there „the explorer“ and I hope you give me some price cuts on your wares :)
---
It was awesome during the beta, not so much now.
---
4-5 high levels is more than enough to kill the queen unless they've got really bad builds or bad gear. Unless you've got a swarm of low levels she'll go down just fine for even 1 person.  
---
You can use cripple perks to keep her on the ground, you can freeze her with the cryolator, you can super duper a pile of orbital strike beacons, you can set up a base just outside the nuke zone and use artillery on her. If you want, my squad will help you out though. We kill the queen regularly, and mostly without complication.
---
Fair enough, poor choice of words on my op.  
---
Yeah, this is very frustrating and a simple system to mark/flag what you already know when look at a vendor's inventory should have been included at launch.
---
On one hand you're absolutely correct. On the other hand this applies to anything that can be user modifed.
---
Yeah I almost had a heart attack the first time this happened because I thought I lost all my mutations. 
---
Yeah...been thinking about changing to that cause it reduces damage from screamy bois, but at the same time dots kill me a ton too
---
Haha I think we can all agree with that! 
---
Yeah any card that can be leveled up can be gotten and kept as a duplicate. It may seem pointless but it allows you to try out different perk combinations later on if you have one of them maxed and one at a lower level. 
---
On a sunny day? Sure, but prob. rough.
---
If it's been nuked?........................ HAHAHAHAHAHA.
---
Seriously, though, if you've got help or maybe have Marsupial mutation to hop up above melee range you can pick stuff off and it will level you up fast.
---
The mutant quest isn't a fixed spawn point, it changes every time you log.  The missing link is a meta quest, your actual objective should be under another quest.  Double check that you aren't just overlooking something first.
---
Platform? I'm looking for a furious M2 but yeah... 
---
Most high level players farm it so most likely there will be high level monsters spawn in.
---
Two-Shot Explosive
---
I had a stove plan dissapear between buying it at the shop and walking home just today.
---
Because you failed to kill the raider attacking your camp
---
So much this (as well as the link in this thread). I now run at max settings and it is pretty damn smooth. Granted I am running @ 1920x1080 but it made a world of difference for me.
---
Ginger, furry, whiskers, apparently doesn’t like dice
---
Why do you think rust pvp is bad? 
---
Goddamn it’s that easy to make? Do vendors sell plans for that?
---
I don't understand your point, I'm describing the way using TSE is ok by being alone and "How to" not destroy everyone else experience by using this OP item. And you are trying to Re-Explain me how you are gonna do whatever you want because "reasons" its ok mate, your dick is not bigger when you say it, believe me.
---
Just don't be a dick
---
They will be back don’t worry
---
They need destructable camps so people dont lock players in or put camps to block pve locations etc
---
I’m not too sure, I’ve gotten my plans from maps
---
I get having multiple level cards, but I have not gotten any useless ones like if I have a 1 star, 2 star, and 3 star already, total of 6, I have not gotten a useless 7th card. Also like starched geans is only 2. I have a 2 star, and an animated 1 star. I cant get a 4th to make the animated card 2 star as well?
---
yes it is amazing 
---
haha. I've thought about it. But I think I'd get banned, from the building AND the game.
---
Would love a way to reroll perks.. i have about 10 or 15 perk cards that duplicated to lag glitches when lvling up and ended up getting 2 or three cards.
---
5-ish every time I've looted it, and all the clipboards you can carry. 
---
I made an alt to try out new builds and kinds of weapons.  There’s more to look forward to, my camp moves around again, things change more often, and for better and for worse I’m more weak and vulnerable, including in pvp.
---
There was nothing left for my lvl 102 main but farming the RNG and having a stash full of legendaries that aren’t good enough because they aren’t dupes of the few OP types.
---
With the level 21, upgrades abound and I have 400lbs of unused stash :D
---
Your save files tell you how long you've played. 
---
Is there a way that is in place, or if not could be implemented to give fans a heads up towards some of the coming atom shop updates so that we don’t miss out while we’re away?
---
What I don't like is you can't rank up the cards how you want. If a card has a max of 5 and I have a rank 3, but would also like a rank 2 for certain builds, I can't add two rank 1's to make a rank 2. It needs to max out the original card first and makes getting different ranks of certain cards impossible. 
---
You think? My friend uses it and he loves it. 
---
Hmmm. I have two characters, a level 76 and a 32. I never xp farm and put hard limits on RNG crap like server hopping. I only did the Whitesprings nuke once and haven’t been back. I focused on general adventuring, looting and killing stuff till I was 50 so I’d get max level quest items. I mostly gather stuff to zero out vendors as much as I can so I have caps to buy plans, which I’m collecting. I like building camps, then tearing them down and moving to a new place to do it again. Also I like discovering weird little game mechanics to exploit and kill things in weird and/or amusing ways.
---
You can have mine, I'm online right now, add talesofgaming
---
Yes, if it's the brown mod box it's one time use
---
You're not the only Reddit noob, I joined just to post in the fo76 sub.  So I'm new too lol.
---
Another comment said something smart what 8f 8ts the ENCLAVE that performing this since vault tech was in colleagues with the government what to stop them from experimenting after the war?
---
Ya I have rifle as my primary and usually have a melee weapon just in case i run out of ammo or the rifle breaks. But i haven't really decided as i dont have any melee perks yet. 
---
Maybe I'll give the shotgun a shot, I've used the combat shotgun a couple times.
---
I think I'm going to do the semi auto as I dont like automatic that much as it tends to be less accurate and waste more ammo.
---
All I Know is Decon Shower and Fusion Generator. So build smart, know where you plan to build them or don’t be afraid to remove some floors and Roofs to build them and to replace removed structures afterwards. 
---
If you keep this in mind while building, everything is possible :-)
---
If you are using a melee weapon, it also adds damage. If you are using a ranged weapon it only adds durability.  
---
Actually, it has at least three that I can think of off the top of my head.
---
I've got three characters two 110+ and a 80+ Lvl. Each character has a specialty melee, ranged, and universal.  I have at least that much time in. One day I chase vendors, the next I wander around looking for plans, the next a do events. Always have a goal for your session. Most days I complete daily challenges and do one Nuke event. I do this with or without friends. 
---
Did you not watch the video I linked
---
The perk shouldn't affect legendary explosive shot mod, that is all I say, or not affect it the way it does. 100% more damage is A LOT.
---
Jokes on them, I delete those screenshots right after the challenge is finished.
---
Don't want those nasty undies messing with my other awesome loading screens.
---
Yeah, but you can wear the tattered dress *and* the vault suit, because the dress takes up the OUTFIT slot, not the underarmor slot. It is the only outfit with any bonus.
---
For explosive shotguns, bloodied is extremely effective otherwise they are equally as strong without nerd rage. Bloodied is going to have much better accuracy as 2 shot always effects accuracy for some reason.    
---
because the thread was about using old and new knowledge/method. You just popped in here, talking about completely different things. Your comment is logical i don't think people would disagree. It looks like you just write your own stuff but it has no connection to this thread. Nobody said that learning boring but useful things was a bad thing. Are you trying to comment somewhere else but you accidently posted it in this thread?
---
np :)
---
literally same
---
I think it's supposed to say 76hours cause I had a 24 hour achievement and now I believe it's at 76 hours
---
yeah last time i checked my pip boy it was only october 27th? i’ve been playing since launch and you’re telling me it’s only been 4 days?
---
Point 4  what was your point?
---
It's a lot better than it was. The damage is done from the shitshow at launch, so full-price is questionable, but if you love Fallout you'll get pretty wrapped up in it just like you did the other games.
---
it’s completely random, unless you buy the mutation from MODUS. 
---
Whaaaat that’s crazy, I use guns though. 
---
I'm responding to the comment where the person begrudged their educator for having to learn how to arrive at a solution in a certain way. 
---
Had a terrible time last night, played probably 4 hours and CTD 4 times losing my junk during a spawn at one point. Submitted a feedback ticket and a support ticket. Hope they are working on fixing the crashes. I'll deal with the bugs if they could just fix the crashing. 
---
Suppressor is the big differentiator for gauss IMO.  If you aren’t doing a stealth build then...probably better options for weapon 
---
What if the enclave is running this experiment. Since vault tech and the government were close before war maybe vault tech became  their research division
---
It's pretty handy ya, gives the same benefits as halfing the deterioration (like from Gunsmith or Makeshift Warrior) except it takes fewer ranks and you don't have to have it equipped while running around, just while repairing.
---
And, if you over-100%-repair melee weapons they gain bonus dmg above their normal. Not sure if it's a bug or what, but it seems to work consistently for everybody so maybe it's an unlisted feature? 🤷
---
Do you have a row of useful benches and a bed?  It stays.  Is there a turret and a lowbie using it to help kill ghouls to level?  It stays.  Are the one or more turrets with no one around afking the ghouls.  Tear that sumbitch to the ground.  I will eat the 500cap bounty all day and then give my cap reward to a lowbie in the area.  Win all around.
---
I avoided buying it because of this. It would be great if they could change it to be in at least two parts: Suit and Helmet.
---
That mod looks very interesting, at least for me, I would love to know the name.
---
Yeah, but those are underarmors. The tattered dress is an outfit. They take up different slots, you can wear them at the same time.
---
As far as I know you can't get more than one within an time period and hour or some hours. You have to server hop to reset the cooldown timer.
---
Yeah, same - I'm not *too* bothered by the UI itself for the most part, but I'd love to be able to change the Pip-Boy interface color itself. I *kinda* get why they might've removed it as an option - it's not unique to just your Pip-Boy, but also to any terminals you find, and, probably, anyone else's Pip-Boys, too - but it'd still be great as an option. I'd think they should be able to make the color unique - since we can already modify the Pip-Boy at an armor bench to change its color, maybe add an option to change its color, too, like how some headlamps can be changed? But even if that can't be done for whatever technical reasons, I'm not really going to be seeing other people's Pip-Boys all that often - I'm sure I could find a way to deal with them all having the same color as me if it meant I could pick the color used.
---
I’m asking because I have a bloodied heavy guns build and I’m wondering if a TSE 50cal will do more damage than a bloodied explosive 50cal
---
Dude found me three times and just gave me some certificate this third time.  Says G.A.S. certificate.  He decided to do this in the middle of   Hold the line so I was rather busy and haven't read it yet but I will tonight.
---
Well I'm currently trying to complete Early Warnings but in order to do that I need the uplink... Which I can't get until I complete The Missing Link, but the missing link quest itself has glitched where in the pip boy it only says "Complete Roses Quests...", it isn't saying that i did the syringer or death claw checkpoints and Rose is unresponsive when I try to interact with her
---
haha I think your right, I expect people to use common sense to much
---
has anything been fixed? they've nerfed, fixed exploits, and baited people to the atom shop - but has anything that really matters within the game been fixed?
---
It can’t make 2mmEC rounds tho x_x
---
Be sure to address the gamemaker directly on a public forum regarding your minor cosmetic requests.
---
You should post a map of the random encounter locations.
---
Yeah that’s what someone else said, that’s pretty crazy considering it doesn’t tell you that. 
---
I'm actually not sure about that I've never personally experienced that, sorry I can't give you a definitive answer. My best advice would be to go through the perk cards when you level up and see if starched genes is there. You should see that (for example) if you have lockpick, you can't pick another lockpick. So if you can pick another starched genes, then my guess would be that you can get one in a pack, and vice versa, if you can't pick it then if you get it, then it will automatically be deleted.

1. Playing on PC - system specs shouldn't matter for this issue, but it's an i7 something with 32gb ram, gtx 1070 8gb

3. Please fix the building issues.  Image attached: [https://imgur.com/a/8hS9gUV](https://imgur.com/a/8hS9gUV) was my latest issue.
---
4. For some reason no matter what I built around this wall piece or deconstructed, it would not go away.  So now I have to scrap my entire CAMP yet again.  I'm getting CAMP build burnout, which is nuts because I love building.  But this frickin CAMP system has too many problems.  PLEASE fix it.   I cannot say how many CAMPs I've had to scrap because of issues like pieces not being scrappable or movable, despite not being "supporting" the structure.  
---
There are other dumb issues with CAMPs.  I keep having to move and re-build my camp because every location I pick seems to have some terrain glitch or somesuch that stops it from being placed 100% or even 50% of the time.  I've had a CAMP not build in a spot for no apparent reason and then go down next time I log in, for no apparent reason.  I've built CAMPs out of the way of typical build spots and most of them get junked because they won't respawn on login.  The only consistent way I've found is to build a simple, one-level CAMP that doesn't go near the ground.  Stop forcing me to build floating castles.  They look dumb.
---
There's one around the bog at a campsite relatively local to a radio tower.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Made an alt
---
I'd love to have my own KL-E-O (from fo4)... But we all know it's just going to be the ammo vending machine model.
---
I love these little scenes and try to remember to use photomode to record them.  One of my favorites is on a mountainside in teh Savage Divide, a teddy bear wearing a beanie, wielding an axe lined up to a tree like a lumberjack.  I'm trying to remember where I saw the teddy bears set up like they were filming a cooking show.
---
What time zone are you in? , I've added a few people recently from here but they rarely seem to be online. I'm in the UK, tend to play most evenings and have a mic but I'm OK to play without it if people are shy / don't have one. 
---
I'm level 46, have not done a silo run yet but have 5 keycards so am ready to hit one soon.

I think Rust PvP in fallout is bad. I loved Rust. And why is because Rust was a game designed for PvP and “griefing” and finding ways into others bases etc. it was entirely resource and building based and combat was the cream on top. Fallout is so much more, and such a simple PvP system just doesn’t work, it creates too many pure griefing scenarios when people are just trying to enjoy an actual story or quests or roleplaying. Essentially, everyone in Rust was trying to kill each other so no one was too surprised or annoyed when they died. In fallout, you have collectors, role players, people in it for the story, people in it to just build houses in cool places, people who like farming and gifting to newbies, people who like getting workshops and setting up bases or people to come in and rest, the list goes on. This creates massive frustration when a player with one of these many goals in mind comes across someone purely here for PvP or griefing. It’s no longer a chess match where both parties have the same goal and abilities, it’s now some kid knocking the chess players pieces off just for fun.
---
rigt but u can do that for a whole for regular ammo and then go to grafton for the materials to make EC
---
Leave the server, join a different one.
---
What’s TSE?
---
One issue I take with this reply is that other people have said something different. They say 76 was an experiment, rather than the hope of civilization. This shows that either there is a real explanation and Bethesda haven't communicated it well enough through holotapes and terminals, or there is no real reason and Bethesda just manufactured a scenario where a bunch of adults are let out of a vault and disperse, without first trying to form a community.
---
The other is that if the point of the vault was to keep the best and brightest together to rebuild civilisation then the results were terrible. What actually happened when the doors were finally opened was the overseer ran off to find her husband without anyone there to assist her, everyone else dispersed and started trying to kill eachother, and at most 4 people got together to build a tiny base. Why didn't the best and brightest realise they'd be better off building a small town just outside the base? e.g. Megaton. The one thing you get a lot of in Fallout are factions. The BOS, Institute, the small towns, the New Vegas Strip, the Great Khans, even raiders hang around in groups. Other than the player character, you see very few individuals or small bands.
---
I honestly can't live without them. Tried to make a new character today and couldn't do it haha. I understand what your saying though. At times I feel I have to have mutations and power armour. 
---
Jokes on them, I’ll walk around naked even without the challenge. 
---
Now I want an equipable underwear outfit. 
---
Don't get me wrong, i agree with you. It just seemed weird, i wasn't trying to be a dick, sorry if i was
---
I would imagine the fact that you are doing more damage is pulling them to you. A lot of games use a system that basis who the mobs attack is based on the damage they are receiving from different sources
---
I can't play this game without Marsupial. I'm not melee so I don't care about the Strength penalty. 2 points in Starched Genes is worth it. 
---
XB1 here so I'll be unable to help you
---
They make like 100x easier lmao 
---
Those of you eager to jump into Fallout 2, don't forget to download the [Restoration Project](http://www.killap.net/) for bug fixes &amp; restoration of cut content. [List of changes](https://falloutmods.fandom.com/wiki/Killap%27s_Fallout_2_Restoration_Project)
---
You normally (by default) place it when you select it in your inventory.  However you can also drop it using the drop option button choice at the bottom.  This makes it enterable by anyone.
---
I do that with all but my lead extractor and 1 water purifier.
---
"CONGRATULATIONS!"
---
*while shooting a bunch of super mutants*
---
'You really think this is a good time buddy?'
---
Alright. You wanna do some tonight?
---
To be completely honest, we as a payer base can offer you opinions on the game, but ultimately, its -you- who decides on whether you enjoy it or not. 
---
I personally love the game, despite its buggy nature and never fail to at least disconnect once a day surprises. But I'm also blessed to have lots of friends to laugh at the chaos and to also enjoy the plot twists and discoveries made.   
---
Just the left of it, made sure it hit the airport, and all the other buildings in Charlseton, the DMV had 2 or 3 legendry's in a group right when you went in and they respawn multiple times, the edge of the zone left the Charleston station open so people could fast travel
---
I keep telling myself this but day after day i have 10 points in STR, 3 in Int, and 3 in AGI... *sigh*
---
Listen to the power armor perks they help even at rank 1 power armor x01 legs take a lot of springs to repair
---
Ok sorry for asking. I didn’t mean to get that impression. That’s only one thing I needed
---
I got all plans for deep pocketed and BOS combat armor from the Grafton station and Grafton responder bots. Took server hopping but they are there
---
it's not bad, if you a melee build you should be fine, you just have to know your way to avoid the ghouls. Has a lot of decent vendors inside the resort, I wouldn't avoid it, but there are higher level enemies. I would avoid the parking lot, stash your junk first and take a look around, a lot of decent loot, stash boxes. 25 is a decent level .. not sure I Agree with peoples comments here to avoid it .. definitely avoid the glowing ones during a blast zone ..
---
I'm not sure if nukes count for either bounty collection or bounty accumulation, because a friend of mine went to stand in the center of the nuke zone before it launched to get the achievement and I didn't get a bounty (he was also there with someone who wasn't in our group).
---
Dump all the junk you have in your stash.
---
Travel to a location with toxic water.
---
Pick up 1,000s of this shit.
---
Repeat this:
---
Drink toxic water.
---
Get a mutation.
---
Cure mutation if you don't want it.
---
Server hop.
---
PS
---
Also if you are about to die, there is (was?) a bug if you die too shortly after getting the mutation you are likely to be flagged but not receive benefits. So kill yourself if close to death. And keep drinking. Deaths cure a bit of rads each time.
---
Yes check out this video on how to customize your camp spawn. https://youtu.be/nCZO8zwx7mc
---
Simple answer no, you can only do it for workshops.
---
Fissure site or whitesping?
---
You can move your CAMP device around 
---
It influence „where“ exactly you spawn when you fast travel to your camp 
---
You need do it by trial and error, just move it around and fast travel 
---
Honestly, there's *SO* many things they didn't tell us, or told us wrong. Like Marine Armor being the strongest 🤦nope, turns out max lvl Heavy Combat is tougher now. Or the fact that Intelligence seems to still increase XP like it did in Fo4, even though they didn't list that at all.
---
Just use starched rank 2 and you'll keep the mutations class freak only raises the good and lowers the bad
---
And imo there is only like 4 really good/needed  mutations the bloodied one health regen the 2 melee defense the others are meh 
---
Yeah, that's why I said moderately.
---
I do. Until just recently I was unmitated. Mind you I’m 106. And somewhere around the late 90s I started the mutation farm. So far I have demon speed, and marsupial. I’m trying to get my hands on Healing Factor, Egg Head, and Herbivore.
---
I moved points from endurance which I used aquaboy/girl, rad resistance, and life giver, so now I have just 2endurance and rank 1 life giver. Exchanged for class freak, and starched genes. I’m regretting it now but it’s too late. 
---
Just a little addition, pocketed works as well it just increases the limit less than deep pocketed. You can also up your strength and use certain perks. Its funny though right now when I'm in PA I can carry less than when I'm out of it
---
Would be nice to decorate my camp with nuka cola branded posters im guessing they come from the nuka bottling plant as an event reward maybe?
---
Yeah.. any bloated ghoul will rad you up super fast too.. which dots are rad damage?
---
I'tll be back- lot of peeps want it. How funny is it that that thing and *FISH LAMP* are hot.
---
Where... did I blame anyone? Exactly?
---
I've heard Morgantown has a nice amount/selection of plants. I nuked it once, but missed them. It was however fun to do someplace else and while the spawns are nothing like Whitesprings there were still some (as opposed to zero, like some places)
---
I haven’t seen those, but I try to avoid SBs. Only killed my first one on Wednesday. I need one of those SAMs for my CAMP though. 
---
It's no more buggy than all of the other stuff out there. If you like the fallout 4 format, you'll like this.
---
its not duped son
---
My default outfit is naked with a police hat, aviators and a bandana, so these were right up my alley.
---
If I launched that nuke, then I'm for sure using my TSE Handmade. 
---
Those are my mobs. You want to farm your own, drop your own nuke. 
---
When maxed it doubles the weapons usable time, and also increases the damage from what I've seen others talk about
---
You can, they are just under Ammo &gt; Energy Weapons or something weird like that. Lead and steel, no gunpowder required.
---
Yes and yes 
---
The range! I could deal with all the rest but the range is freaking terrible.
---
More then likely the perk that lets you hack robots will let you tame them like the other two creature and animal perk cards and you can turn them into vendors in your base. That’s how I imagine it going.
---
I meant at the ammo factory :)
---
a specific type of underarmor with a plan that is... tricky to get?
---
It was white springs and so what every body goes there to leech xp from nukes zone 
---
I think you might be looking for advertisement posters.
---
Heard the ski lodge might be a good spot.
---
Maybe even the nuka cola plant?
---
Watoga vendors?
---
GL
---
Never mind! After the 5th time relogging all of my quest came back. Thank you!
---
No worries, much appreciated though. Gives me something to do until Bethesda adds to the game
---
I favor carnivore. Meat is so so abundant and with the cannibal perk you dont have to carry anything. 
---
Mmm, drugs.  I need some psychobuff!
---
I've heard it was the Ultracite set. That's just straight ballistic protection though. 
---
all things given if the servers were actually stable and didnt crash every damn time you took a workshop or bombed out during events you might have a solid case, but they are not stable and taking a workshop is just asking for the game to die.
---
Running Watoga 10 times  in 30mins or so with Pharma Farmer will get you the stims considerably faster with little to no chance of the server dying.
---
Sometimes they attack, sometimes they simply vanish.
---
Hopefully, I will have to try and grind some out. Does an event spawn down there that you know of?
---
[This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f114ff&amp;d=pl2pp2pk2pd2p02e60lv2lr2lk2lt2l30l71ao0as2an2ar2a72s70a00ic0sa0sd0sb0so0sp0s12&amp;w=&amp;n=Sniper%20MKII) is my current build. I'm still toying with moving a perk around here or there, like Gunsmith. But you get the idea. 
---
I run a sniper rifle, whether it's gauss, hunting, or lever (Gauss is best, but I don't have the mods for it so I run hunting or level depending on level), a handmade semi-auto rifle for mid / sustained, a combat shotgun for close to mid (with scope) and for crippling, and then a melee weapon. A lot of the time I'm not in PA so I have a power fist for outside of it and an axe in it. However I'll probably just carry an axe. 
---
I'd love to have some other weapons as I'm the far off guy, but weight is such an issue I can't carry even more weapons. Which isn't a huge problem since I don't have the perks for them anyway. 
---
there's only the default roof.. there is a little pyramid with a barn colored spire thing but that's the only one with any variation from metal outside, wood inside.
---
I personally dont like taking anything temporary in any game i play. If its only a time limited buff or an easily gotten rid of trait i pretend it doesnt exist.
---
Keep in mind the game is still very early and they are working out alot of glitches, so changes will happen to many systems within the game. Whats good now might not always be worth it later on.
---
But for me it boils down to my perfect build. If i want to survive the wasteland a certain way i build around that core even if it isnt the meta or the most powerful build its more about your personal playstyle.
---
Like marsupial for example, ill admit, it caught my eye and its pretty cool but i have a melee/sniper build so all it really equates to for me is a quality of life benefit and not anything that would actually save my life or help me or my team in any real way.
---
Thats just my two cents though, its ultimately up to you how you wanna survive the wasteland, and each build has its benefits and downfalls.
---
Yes, I will consider next time add more than one subject to the main text, sadly this is the first time for me posting and getting this amount of reviews about what I say, but I stay still with my way to see things right now.  
---
The main problem here is TSE weapons and the way people use them, this, of course, is handling the fact that TSE weapons are mostly dupped items and almost everyone has them ( i am not saying all of them are duped I said MOSTLY for a reason ). We can't talk about TSE weapons without talk about duping items, because it is what they are, sadly this is the way things work in Fo76 right now.  
---
And just to add here I appreciate the tip for the next occasion, merci.
---
Gazman2k10 I haven't played in a while but I need to get back into the game 
---
It's easy to find on the nexus forgot the name.
---
Well I don’t doubt they will add new weapons down the road I just want some that we haven’t seen in a while or just more completely new ones lol 
---
I've never found the time to be offended and you were not being a dick. 
---
They are too good to pass up. Best is to focus your build and you should have perks to spare for luck. Hybrid builds are possible, but you'll be giving up one thing or another. Would be nice to see some perks for not being mutated though.  
---
Yep, the game just does a really shitty job of explaining and showing that selecting the perk category and selecting the card are two separate acts. Took a lot of us more than a few levels to figure it out.
---
I assume the vendors will be placed in the newly opened vault for the sale of „not nuking those traders“
---
Also since since there is the „no human NPC“ policy, I assume it will be protectrons or worse, some machine 
---
Are you on PC?  I took a level 5 guy to get his first power armor a few days ago, and if it was you I’m glad it made you happy.  
---
He could have just left the game and joined a new server. 
---
If you are going to farm them, go to Emmet Mountain Disposal Site. There is a decontamination shower there.  
---
You can buy Mutation Serums at the Enclave for 4800 caps (full price).  
---
The easiest way is to find someone who has the recipe and is selling the serum. I saw a guy last night on Xbox selling all mutations for 5000 caps or 500 caps each.
---
I agree.
---
I also had it be invisible for me. Like just. Straight up not there when it definitely was. Popped into existence when I shot him, though. 
---
Terrible Shit Explosion.
---
Not too sure I've not even been down to it yet but I would imagine its similar to the power stations where the event starts when someone goes nearby
---
Pretty much everyone does not have them.
---
Mothman's mood changes depending on your in game actions.  Sometimes he's a bit ornery. 
---
Well, the Vault-Tec plan as far as we have ever seen was ‘best and brightest, rebuild America’ and the secret ‘seize control of the nuclear silos for Vault-Tex’. 
---
Vault-Tec intended that we would join and take-over the Responders and Brotherhood or whatever was going on surface side. This is not directly stated, but implied along with the fact that the Overseer is horrified that everyone died due to a lack of leadership to get them to work together. Vault 76 is a control vault in that it’s purpose is societal preservation. Player theories suggest that it’s not but that only makes sense if Vault-Tex could have foreseen the Scorched Plague which seems unlikely. 
---
The story we’re left with is the remains of a normal Fallout story minus a PC to save everyone, because the PCs were waiting for the Vault door to open. 
---
I used that with lead belly. It’s a good combo. But I have a ton of veggies in my garden, more than enough to last a play session. I also make cranberry runs for cranberry cobbler for the bonus 5%xp. 
---
Yeah, must have flew there via an explosion or something. 
---
yeah i sold mine, then bought another one the other day for experimenting with
---
That is a great question, to which I do not have the answer. I play mostly solo, so I haven't done it myself, but had seen it done. 
---
I haven't had much of a chance to play since the silo hotfix unfortunately. 
---
I keep getting crap mutations, though I did get chameleon and was having fun with that and a sniper rifle before bed.
---
Are you sure? I've tried to check and came up empty. I even contacted Sony directly to ask, and they said there's no way to check.
---
I found one in the Forest once, near the first Overseer stash.  I randomly chose a wire and chose the right one, but the loot was nothing to write home about.  Someone in another comment mentioned Luck level, but I was low level and I doubt it was more than 2, maybe 3.
---
Are you talking about PvP or competing for kills and loot at events?
---
What weapons and armor do you favor?
---
Right. 
---
I heard there is a spot to put them so it can fire all over the map; I think at a workshop. But I can't confirm. 
---
As much as I like being an honorary male member of the Mistresses of Mystery, I wish I could gain the benefits without having to put on a dress.  Oh well.
---
Any stash you access is your stash!  and you can move your camp around with you anytime you want to set it down near where you are for a small number of caps.
---
Why do you think it's acceptable for a game to crash twice a day in 2018?
---
What other AAA games have you played in the past 5 years that had crashing problems like that.
---
And I mean... I don't really know what else to tell you. That entire paragraph you just typed out was all negative things about the game. If you choose to ignore them, that's totally fine, but saying you don't understand why people don't like it doesn't make sense to me.
---
Your right they need to balance a lot of weapons right now but I’d also like to see a colt 1911 because we definitely need more handguns 
---
Be sure to address the gamemaker directly on a public forum regarding your minor interface requests.
---
Dang, OK that kinda balances it out a bit better 
---
other players see their inv in your stash box. theres nothing to steal
---
Feel free to add me. I'm lvl 72 and I can craft you some decent armor :)
---
CAN1-kennabis
---
No but it’s the same spot I’m sure.  I am on Xbox. 
---
I’m lvl 58, are you from England ?
---
Well you could always switch back. But yeah, I guess you might as well play it out.
---
Trying to get all the plans, checking out locations I have skipped or haven't been to since the beginning, looking for rarer events, tweaking my camp.
---
You are doing gods work.
---
No they can't, they can ruin your base and get a bounty though. Camps are portable yes 
---
But if you have a PC, you can use it to play the games.  I imagine they're not very resource intensive if you have a somewhat modern PC.

---
Same here, similar setup, rtx2070 16gb ram i5 49??K cpu
---
No. You can just spam minimum-level arms and unlock everything.
---
Thought it was tickle party myself 
---
Can you confirm or deny if you see their names on screen as they approach? At what distance can you see some sort of player marker over your approaching attackers?
---
Nuke zone you'll want the X01.
---
Regular play you'll want Ultracite.
---
Thanks for the tip! Much appreciated
---
Oh and especially the Brush Gun. The sound is much more satisfying than what they've used in FO4 and '76 for the lever action.
---
Yep. Hence my struggle. :)
---
T51b
---
Coms are terrible in this game, even worse before they added push to talk
---
Hey, I can't find you on xbox. Sure you spelled it right? :) 
---
Looks like the naked in power armor floating above the ground bug I have seen reported elsewhere.
---
No its the Skyrim Extractor, you unlock it for killing the scorch beast king.
---
Yes please!!!
---
How do I pick them up? (PS4)
---
How about for "Wendy's Revenge" the special clown suit is a reskinned hazmat suit?
---
Darnok and Jalad at Tanagra!!!!!!!a
---
Ya I have a junk collecting problem so that's why I just have one gun and a melee weapon. Plus it takes so much longer for the combat knife to break so I have started using it on anything level 10 and below. Right now I've been focusing on the perception (for the rifleman) and endurance (I'm a cannibal in an attempt to save weight since I dont need food)
---
I've always been a power armor fan but for some reason this game I'd rather not have it at all so I've been sporting the combat armor. I'm only level 34 so maybe itll change my mind when I am ready to launch a nuke.
---
If you want arm mods, you have to scrap arms.
---
If you want chest mods, you need to scrap chest pieces.
---
Correct!
---
you still wanted?
---
I feel like starched genes isn't a perk that is a mandatory always on.   
---
Just pop it on whenever you need to take a radaway or decontaminate.  
---
Otherwise just have 3 luck open for Class Freak 3.  
---
I'm running stealth sniper build (vats, crit) myself
---
I just swapped out tormentor for it.   
---
Current mutations are speed demon, marsupial, and eagle eye.
---
Going for chameleon, carnivore, bird bones, and healing factor next.
---
&gt; What experiment can one create to test whether its reality or a simulation
---
Science is based on the very idea that our human experience is genuine and can be relied on as a trustworthy tool to gather information. 
---
You're basically asking how we could scientifically prove that science could be a lie.
---
Sometimes even after a nuke zone goes away the spawns will still act as if the area is still nuked.
---
yes. and the bounty went up cause someone’s turrets was shooting at me..
---
The hero we needed , not the one we deserved .
---
hi Tempest i sent you a friend request on discord and soon to be on fallout 76!
---
my username on discord is same as my username here!
---
Challenge yourself.  Try a Min Strength, Min Endurance Plague Walker Build that doesn't use Class Freak, Melee, Explosive weapons(both Legendary effect or grenades/m79 etc.) or Stealth.
---
In a pinch you could just make a ton of healing salves. All you need is boiled water, blood leaf, and soot flower. In 20 min of running around (and maxed super duper) I made 87 salves which restore 1/3 of your HP. Not as effective as stims, but cheaper.
---
Is this a trap? Lol, I will help you out
---
We dont really know what China was like, id find it highly amusing to find out that they were trying to emulate the US and have a familiar but different style because of that.
---
It also about time they added a bit more lore to the backstory of Fallout, it doesnt have to be "This is exactly" how it started but it could be fun to give a bit more evidence to a few of the theories. Enough for the theory crafters to build a larger mebe story than they have now.
---
But the robots? 
---
Wasn't correcting you was adding I acquire it
---
Let's be bad guys. #FireflyForever
---
Who's the white vendor bot
---
That's a death machine to protectrons? (Phoenix)
---
You're damn right
---
Who is the bot
---
That you can never find in his shop? (Phoenix)
---
Can ya dig it?
---
Who's the droid
---
That won't cop out when there's scorchbeasts all about?
---
(Phoenix)
---
Right on
---
You see this bot Phoenix is a bad mother (*ERROR*)
---
But I'm talkin' about Phoenix (Then we can dig it)
---
He's a complicated can but no one understands him but the Brotherhood (Vendor Bot)
---
The visceral hate for a game and the people who play it is what I'm referring to. Gtav is one of the best examples of a AAA title that had it's fair share of glitches and server issues at launch ofcourse it got better it wasnt released half assed but it was a mess at first and it got way better alot of ubisoft games have some bugs and they are still playable. People bashed ac unity and I think it's a good game. Maybe I just appreciate what we got currently I'm sure it will get better with time. Also its Bethesda things just work haha if you buy a Bethesda game you know you are in for a buggy fun game
---
Correct.  Note that you can also access your stash in train stations and Red Rocket locations, so you don't have to go all the way back to your C.A.M.P. to deposit or withdraw stuff.
---
How amazing would it be if like you said the Fallout 76 we're playing now is a simulation and sometime in the future we somehow escape the simulation and the "real world" ends up being Fallout 5 in a brand new game engine built for next gen?
---
I didn't say you were? I wasn't even in reply to you? And in actuality most of the players aren't going to dupe.
---
not a trap, i seriously wanna die but i think someone got me first.
---
Make sure to get a couple of hits on them and you should get the XP after that.
---
Just dont, and I know this from a very painful experience, hit any of the robots.
---
Once they kill the mob they turn on you....lol

I’m on PS4 and haven’t crashed yet, but have disconnected a couple times. The last time it happened really sucked. I DC’d yesterday a minute or so after completing the Camp McClintock mission. When I logged back in I had to complete the entire mission all over again for some reason. My guy was wearing the military uniform when I got DC’d and he no longer had it when I got back on. 
---
If I was just a bit further and had to redo the DMV mission instead of McClintock, I’d have thrown my PlayStation out the window.
---
Not sure. For pc you open pipboy  and press v
---
It's not just the quest it's the rewards.  It's pretty much the best done quest in the game.  The sword and 44 are the only level upgradable legendary items and the mistress outfit plus eye actually provide additional effects on top of the other mistress legendary weapons.
---
They committed an abnormal amount of VA work to the quest as well.
---
Yeah there is a lot I’m finding out recently that isn’t even explained at all. Sometimes I get more answers reading stuff about Fo4 than I do Fo76. 
---
It’s the tail end of a nuke session. You’ll see eye bots, liberators, protectrons with tracks. It gets bananas if you hang out long enough.
---
Ok, I added you, add me if you end up needing a killing lol
---
My first Mothman just sat there while I killed it at a low level, maybe it glitched.  The second, Vengeful Mothman, aggressively attacked me.  The third was the Wise Mothman and I attacked it and killed it before realizing that you can interact with this version and gain a 5% experience boost for a period of time.
---
There are different variants of the Mothman and if you pay attention, they have slightly different names.
---
Thank you I think this is what’s going on I’ve noticed the spinning cursor when looking at them.
---
The Reconstituted US Army is actively taking recruits in postwar WV.
---
Although, our main task has so far been executing warrants against wanted persons and reestablishing security on 86/87, we also regularly do relief missions that traitorous brotherhood poseurs can’t or don’t want to do.  We’ve given away more than 400lbs of raw material to civilians.
---
The 5th Division is active in Appalachia, despite the best efforts of the reds.

No, i got the Monty Python reference,  i trie do piggy back it.  what i didnt get,  was the beetlejuicing reference?
---
Is that what its called when you piggy back off someone elses reference like that? 
---
look for me, and be cool
---
My build is highly specialized and very tight and -int is bad for it. So I'm just going to hold out on this character. I may have other characters who indulge in mutations.
---
It week's work some of the pre placed human bodies too. Like Olivia Rivers head. Not that I blew Olivia Rivers head off or anything.
---
Source: fuck Olivia.
---
Action boy - yes 
---
Marathoner - No
---
Can also get the AP refresh chest mod for PA think it's kinetic dynamo
---
Ahh mb, I thought you meant rust pvp was bad, didn't see you meant the style in fallout. 
---
I cant see that working honestly lol.
---
does the orbital strike give you a bounty if you hit the persons base?
---
No it is not safe, you will definitely get rad worms &amp; dysentry at some stage, possibly some sludge lung,  glowing pustules or lock joint - mabe some other affliction. If you are realy unlucky you will get the woopsies .... so join us at your own risk
---
ah it was u who added me, my camps is hard to get to you’ll have to fast travel to me. also my voice chat is on if that’s easy.
---
Kinda in the same boat. Day one xbox one, I can go for hours at a time without crashing most nights. I seem to really only get into issues when I decide to party up. For whatever reason I get more frequent disconnects when partied.
---
I used to have more constant freezing, but it has become less and less.
---
Though I agree performance is an issues in some cases (SBQ gets horrible frame drops, but I expect this one my day one)
---
But the robots were hostile and spawned where the ghouls spawn? 
---
I have seen eyebots spawn instead of ghouls. It was pretty funny.
---
I was attacked by one I randomly encountered in the bog. To get a friendly one, do the event at the lighthouse between Morgantown and Vault 76.
---
not even vault 76? Initially I had this issue but realized when you are over encumbered you can only spawn in the vault. However if you are on a team you can select your teammate and fast travel/spawn on them even when over encumbered
---
Then take egghead as well?
---
PSA: how is this a PSA?
---
Quite frankly old news anyway.
---
You can upgrade it via a weapon workbench. Same with all the other Order items.
---
I thought you guys were overreacting, but now I just got attacked by three at once in camp venture for whatever reason, and...wow, it hurts. I burned through 900 .45 and about 150 diluted stims. I managed to take a screenshot of them all clustered together in the split second where my screen was not completely blue and shaking like crazy. And to add insult to injury, the last one decided to piss off for a while and come back when it was fully healed
---
You can farm all materials at once and get a few levels at same time
---
Marsupial and egghead is a net gain of 5 int. You lose 1 str iirc. That's with class freak specifically.
---
So i created my first character last night after almost a full week of work with a 4 hour daily commute.
---
I just wanted to say eff the hype and enjoy the game. So it was late, I was half way through my beer, and I had just made it out into the field. 
---
I get this invite to party from a level 30 someone. So I'm like cool I guess I'll accept. 
---
Then dude starts talking to me. 
---
I'm exhausted, my girl is 2 feet from me playing a different game and we are going back and forth. 
---
It totally catches me off guard and I have a mini panic attack (I talk for a living btw and public speaking is a huge part of that) and I immediately pull my boom off my headset. 
---
I felt like a dick but man I was not expecting that. 
---
Yeah it has a lot of bugs, when playing with friends they also cant hear me. Sometimes auto -setting is working, sometimes area. You'll never know. 
---
Yes it does. Bloodied is underrated imo, also accuracy is much better then 2shot
---
PVP is definitely wonky, but I think making folks invincible because they are 'strictly here for PVE' would be turning their backs on a fundamental design concept. I think tweaking the damage values and balancing weapons would make PVP less of a cancer.
---
The longer you wait, the more the game will become balanced.  
---
But that balance means XP will become harder to earn and certain loot drops will become more scarce.  
---
The early birds do get more worms, along with the bugs.
---
Heavy weapons / shotgun / melee : max out strength, grab related damage perks
---
Pistols : max out agility, grab either semi or auto pistol damage mod, renegade for hipfire acuracy
---
Rifles : go for perception and grab relevant perks
---
Bloody mess \[LCK 3\] and lone wanderer \[CHR 4\] are good for any solo player
---
Barbarian \[STR 3\] gives you 80 defence at 20 strength when not using power armour
---
Ironclad \[END 5\] gives you 50 defence when not in power armour 
---
luck and agility also have their own perks yielding another 75 defence for no PA users
---
power armour removes limb cripple, boosts carry weight and eliminates rads but needs to be repaired and takes fusion cores to run (not actually a problem later on) T-45 is available at level 25 and can be found in the wild
---
No they appear often at the production terminal in the bunker. I think you have to buy the protective plan before the shielded plan will be available.
---
Hmm interesting.
---
Ok, add me and I’ll head your way
---
You can get an explosive turret with the Home Defense perk card in Agility. 
---
i think i joined you, you’re added btw
---
I run Marsupial and Speed Demon without Class Freak. Marsupial's penalty is irrelevant, and Speed Demon's penalty is manageable. Bird Bones would be nice, but not worth the strength penalty or the triple perk cost.
---
Not a melee player though.
---
Is there a way to use a laser tripwire to automatically close the door when you walk out?
---
This happened to me on December 14th. 
---
We sent messages back and forth for around three days and the. Another series of messages on Christmas and Christmas Eve. 
---
Bethesda said it’s a bug and no fix was in sight. 
---
They told me to make a new character and that they were sorry.
---
Everyone I know quit because I was the only one keeping all of them playing. 
---
Kinda sucks. 
---
Server hop every time you get one. There's a cooldown.
---
Ooh jeg er norsk :D 
---
You can test builds here to see how they work before you invest the perks [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
yes. when you're choosing which save file to open, through the game menu, the length of time is displayed after the file name. At least, it is for me. 
---
Hm I don’t see your ign showing up in my friends 
---
Tasty squirrel soup is 10% just fyi.
---
I have a circuit I run when I log in, I find shitloads of 45/60, the 51 suits seem rarer, and when I find them they never have that arm 😂
---
Haha yea, got myself Some pretty good level 1 legendaries xd
---
well i joined on you. i am in the middle of the mao by seneca rocks
---
What did you get from them? Anything good? Was part of Team of all 110 plus players this morning and they took down the queen 95  legend in 15 min. I was shocked
---
Always a possibility they add something like this down the road in some PvP DLC and associate it with some sort of perk card.
---
Hahaha
---
Fully repair for the plans, partial is just crap
---
There are (roughly) 6 holotapes spread out around Whitespring. They tell a story about the former occupants/guests . I wont say more as i found it interesting to find them.  
---
Ok, shall I travel to you?
---
Nope, when my teammates were discussing where to respawn I was just confused, I could not see them on the (respawn) map, and could only choose the 1 location on the map even though I feel like I was actually closer to another location.
---
Well good thing I can't help but fully repair
---
someone got me already, :( 
---
Hey, Paul and Babe have nothing to do with Appalachia! Let Minnesota have our gods!
---
Yeah but that's a missile turret. I'm talking about a machine gun turret that fires explosive bullets just like those stupid explosive legendary guns. It's not like the turrets are all legendary enemies
---
yes, i cannot see you
---
Be very careful with stuff you care about. We have all lost good stuff do to either people or glitches in the game and it crashing a lot sometimes...
---
Finding the recipient for that is not easy
---
Can we wake up out of the simulation in a new "dimension" full of the good old human npc's?
---
Please and Thank you
---
You're actually off to a great start start, 3 points in everything (except endurance) is highly suggested.
---
Also suggest at least 5 INT for crafting perks.
---
I'll be honest I didn't think camp turrets could even become hostile to other structures since walls tend to incapable of friendly fire
---
How can making weapons last twice as long with more damage (just like in F4 so to me it nothing new) be not worth it. Seems like a no brainer to me, especially when you only need to equip it when you need to.
---
How about a game with no parameters at all?
---
This guy knows. You have to scrap the right armour body part but not necessarily the exact mod.
---
For example: I might unlock pocketed leather legs by scrapping leather legs but not pocketed chest.
---
Scrapping leather chests could unlock lead lined leather chest but not aerodynamic leather arms.
---
None of these need the mod on them to unlock the mod btw.
---
99% sure I’m being trolled but I’m not carrying caps or junk so trying to find you. It’s an adventure 
---
Found one just across the creek west from the Overseer's camp. Tried the red wire and it went boom...
---
oh my god i’m not trolling, i can team invite u so i can’t hurt you? 
---
Well guess i know where Im setting my camp up next.
---
Just as the Enclave wants a strong relationship with the citizens of Appalachia. You can't rebuild the government without civilian support. 
---
I got lucky one night and noticed them on MODUS. I swear I wasn't server hopping when it happened.
---
You may want to try a different resolution or windowed mode. My PC locked up every time the game launched on my 32-inch monitor until I started playing windowed
---
the friend request delay is the problem
---
 I think they are the "exits" from nuke silos, not 100% though
---
She ditched her closest most trusted personal contact to actual apocalyptic hell for the Vault Tek mission. Even if someone was that close of a personal friend with effectively their boss, thats kind of a dubious secret to share to get people on board with you.
---
Assuming they are legitimately the best and brightest (I mean, they start out unable to throw together a brick wall or a light a fire in a barrel here). Everyone walked out that door expecting a moderate effort to restore a mostly intact region, and walked into the mess there is. Zombies are roaming around, horrible hostile FEV monsters roam the landscape, the regional centre of infrastructure in Charleston got destroyed by a terrorist blowing up a dam and washing half the city away. An automated plant turned the north into a toxic disaster. 
---
The 76ers going crazy and offcourse is probably more logical then the survivors doing it, because they're just suddenly hit in the face with all this stuff at once. Meanwhile even the more gradually adjusting survivors were still split up amongst themselves, between Raiders, Brotherhood, Free States, Responders, and whatever independents.
---
As "suddenly turned on each other" goes. Well, you flat out can't do that. The game locks up the PvP til level 5, so any Vault Dweller has to have been out for a bit. Even outside of that, most don't? The general experience is either co-operative or indifferent other then a few outliers.
---
The game definitely lacks a certain design component to serve the story of Reclamation Day. With camps forcibly separated (and blocked out of obvious locations to rebuild in for the most), and the floating lobby stopping any permanence of community.
---
But the irrational response to being dumped into a unexpected hostile and alien situation is prettymuch an understandable one. It makes more sense then some of the other characterizations in the other Fallouts (where there's entire factions like the Kings or Diamond City who act like aliens who stumbled on Earth culture and failed to understand it, rather then people with a direct lineage to it)
---
Make a doctor, people trip on my docotor build she is pretty and badass haha
---
It was easy as fuck to do on my first character in the beta but now I'm playing on alts it's impossible
---
Ps4 here as well and once a day for about an hour i will start blue screen erroring about every 4 or 5 min. With a few server disconnects in between.. after an hourish of frustration and sighing it will clear up and be fine the rest of the night.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Hah. 
---
HAH. 
---
Like me I moved my device back to the edge of my border and no longer spawn in the water in front of my house but about 10 feet to the right of my device. Think it’s best to keep the device outside too
---
Nah, i've seen him live, he also leveled up to 309 and beyound a bit later.
---
oh yeah i forgot they only give 5% after point 1. i didnt level any of them up and mistakenly thought 10% per point was the thing
---
But that's what makes the game appealing to me, finding all this out.
---
Tbh if you played F4 to death, F76 is literally built ontop.
---
Physics, perks, armor, everything feels almost exactly the same, with slight nuances.
---
CET time, almost same as UK :) I'm in Norway. 
---
Some achievements should be insane and difficult.
---
I need to not play The Stanley Parable for another 2/3 years for an achievement. It's been at least 2 years already I've been waiting. I want to play it.
---
This is a neat way to play. I dig it.
---
I've leveled up twice in a single mob in Whitesprings, like in less than a minute.   It's possible.   
---
Also, could be lag.   I've had the map tell me a whole group of people was right around me for over 5 minutes and nobody was there.   
---
That is friggin awesome!
---
The main post here is not against people who use tse or have them by duping or from duppers. The main subject here is not to be a fucking dick with  tse's I don't care how people obtained their tse, I certainly don't care, but the fact is tse weapons ruin everyone's experience.
---
No problem. 
---
Very cool ..
---
Still pretty buggy, not as bad as launch, but judging from the radio silence, it looks to be dead in the water. 
---
If you server hop whitesprings the recipe vendor bot should have it within a few tries. 
---
Yes. Xbox live, PS+, and whatever Nintendo new one is.
---
That Was how it was in the beta. For some reason Bethesda decided to nerf it for the full launch. 
---
Ah I see!
---
I had a problem with MMO stories since WoW. Almost every one YOU are the hero. It's literally up to you and no other including the group you're with to save the world. I'm from UO where your just another Joe or Sue in the world trying to survive and make a living. I was a paid bodyguard for miners and on the side I took the rare bounty or collected a rare item for someone. Some were dedicated crafters. That's all they did. Chill at the smithy with their pack mule and sold weapons, armor, etc. Some made expensive furniture for your house(s). Literally anything you could think of to do in that world, someone made it a career. 
---
Now? Any idiot can be both the warrior/wizard and master craftsman and save the world while helping rebuild a city. I've become numb to this crap, so the opening story thing whatever for 76 I can ignore. It's not as bad as what I've already seen. In fact at least in this game you're just some other person. I like that...
---
/rant
---
Second mk turret is like the spawned turrets that fire explosive rounds. Try it and see for yourself. Not talking about the missile turret.
---
No PC but I am sure you will link up with some cool people. I actually met people checking out their camps and Atom buys. Happy New Year!
---
Be extremtly careful logging out in any nuke zone.
---
Darwin was right.
---
Sorry, I didn't mean don't fix the duping, but I don't think Bethesda can delete just dupes and I would quit if they took all my self found shit away. I'm a 100% self found player and I've put hundreds of hours into each of my characters. The vast majority of tse weapons are dupes and frankly I can do without them anyway. As for serums, just wipe all serums, people who want them have already used them, if theyre sitting in your inventory its because you wanted to dupe and sell them.
---
They seriously better not fucking wipe the game. I'd rather live with all the dupes.
---
yes by % TSE are the best weapons in the game, yes you can kill yourself with TSE weapons, as you can kill yourself with just one shot you can kill almost anything with TSE, that is the problem.
---
One shotting isn't a problem, my TSE double barrel with 3 mutated teammates and perks + chems does about 5k dmg and i one shot everything except SB Queen, but i don't get that much xp.
---
I wouldnt be surprised to see "twink" pvp (lowest level possible, so 5 in this game) if they end up fleshing out the pvp. I've been holding my low level legendaries for this reason.
---
Dude your base is legit, what a spot 
---
If it ends with “ski” it’s probably polish, I know this comment doesn’t help, I’m just being a smart ass because I’m bored XD.
---
I'll try it out.
---
Have you just seen those sexy red dressed lady?!
---
Really, REALLY gotta get the most out of that duped weapon, huh?
---
I think the Enclave is the Illuminati
---
I'll try it
---
*this*... the only endgame ATM
---
I run the game on an ancient phenom II 1090t 16gb ram and a shiny new RTX 2070.  The game ran perfectly smooth with everything at its highest setting until the last patch, whatever optimizations they did, introduced the stuttering to me.  What you've described is exactly what I'm experiencing, so I hope the next improvements patch fixes whatever they did in the last patch.
---
Maya was a cop before she entered the vault, now as she is released into this atomic hell she takes it upon herself to bring justice to the remains of this broken world. With her shotgun in hand she patrols the wasteland as a bounty hunter. 
---
that’s what you were doing? i thought you were just being hesitant..
---
and i made a post on it, for people to come on in if they could reach it. literally no one can get me. took a while to put together. 
---
I just gotta get that instant reload to proc obviously haha.
---
What. I’ve tried putting my camp right there but it never let me. 
---
I don’t have either weapon tho 
---
I have them all but that one was my favorite
---
Im going to make one with sign saying Overseer is a lie 
---
gotta max oot that explosives perk. 
---
Eating nukes for lunch isn't healthy. 
---
Damn, I’m still sitting here admiring lol
---
r/comedycemetery called, they want their cringe back. 
---
Big dog!!!!  I would have been screwed if some dude didn't come through and help me LOL he was like level 14 me 120 hey bro can you help me I need the fusion plans, him sure this is easy, me whatever I just want those plans hahaha dude was nice and I appreciate him helping me. Shit is confushing LOL 
---
Saw a couple people the other day say that action boy was tested to not work with PA.
---
But it certainly feels to me like it does work.
---
The amount for misinformation flying around about this game is staggering.
---
So its just not me who's got freezing and crashing problems
---
I knew I should have read over it 
---
The Nuker
---
Upvoted because this shit needs to be fixed. Also, cockwaffle is an excellent word.
---
You should be able to add them to the frame by accessing the frame as an inventory box even if its higher level. Are you trying to do it on the power armor station MODIFY option?
---
Go an manually repair the walls that have electrical connectors, it will likely then let you do a full repair after... there is a issue when attempting to repair all if you have some electrical connectors in funny ways or if you don't actually have enough resources..
---
i walked out saw u and u scared me. 
---
The shepherd as our aim is to guide civilization into the new world

Forget about it Jake, it's Fallout 76

Isn’t it Mel Brooks too?
---
Almost like duping takes away from the experience, huh?
---
You don’t need to resort to data mining as you can physically enter the executive suite currently.  I won’t explain how, but it’s extremely easy and involves the click of one button, or one key on a keyboard.
---
I tried both with the perk maxed out. The 10mm was still abysmal, took about 4-6 shots to kill a 40 mole miner with all the right perks. The shotgun damage doesn't get that much better, either, but it's more noticeable. The lower level does impact its viability.
---
Did you try using it on enemies?  It looks and  sounds good, however even a quad battery couldn't kill level 30ish mole miners.  I wouldn't gripe if they forms quickly in parallel instead of slowly in series.  The damage and aoe is just too small for offensive use.
---
Wondering what he was doing there....lol
---
This sub breads witch hunters it really does! Not surprising he's not posting on reddit about how boring the game is as the vast majority of players don't bother with this sub or probably reddit in general tbf.
---
Fair play to him, his camp looks cool!
---
By that definition, you can't use rads against mole rats. It was a fair question. Thank you for answering.
---
I forgot after completing it I fell into the cooling water in power armor and it took like 10 mins for me to dide so I could respawn bahhahababa
---
That’s amazing. I really hope they put that stuff in Fallout 5. Those are exactly what keeps me playing their games. Not only are their worlds amazing to begin with, but those little surprises keeps it feeling alive 
---
sorry mate, I will go back in time to make a "high-quality post" just to make you happy and I will try not to be the dick king just for you. Cheers
---
just for the record being a dick for telling you not to be one is a risk I can handle, I mean I don't care to be one if I am not ruining anyone game experience, you didn't pay me to read what I write, so you have one other way, thumbs down and read what you like, it's different in a game you paid for.
---
I know i have the resources but it won't let me manually repair anything at all. I walk up to a broken piece and it does not give me the option. 
---
In Watoga every robot "Protect *Aaaaand* Serve".
---
Vendor at Harpers Ferry "Take *Yoooour* own survival into *Yoooour* own hands".
---
On the flip side by making things rare or only making it seem finite it makes ppl scramble to gain said item.
---
Like me when I logged and saw the blackbird paint on offer for 24hrs...I was like hot dang I better get that now!
---
Priceless! Isn't that just like a cat
---
I try to not use mine in events unless I'm the only one there. As for how I got mine, a friend got it from his friend but he only uses heavy guns and I only play with shotties and it was payment for making him 500+ rounds of 5mm. 
---
There are jerks out there, but in my fiance and I's experience the vast majority of players range from polite to downright helpful.
---
don’t need any extra fusion cores? 
---
Ya it is basically just a tweak of 4. That's part of what annoys me about the tiny changes they didn't mention though. Because it feels exactly like 4 in so many ways that I keep having no clue whether to trust what I learned from 4 or not. The laws of 4 keep leading me astray. Like, because of the leveled equipment, the PA strengths are weirdly out of order compared to 4. And the Furious legendary property is seriously nerfed since 4. Stuff like that.
---
Some of the changes are good, don't get me wrong, but because of all the copypasta there's also some misleading information inside the game itself (the marine armor statement for example again, is a loading screen).
---
The game isnt even out 2 months yet. There sre no veterans.
---
Just because he had a TSE explosive machine gun and can melt me in the blink of an eye doesn't mean I deserve to have my caps taken though.
---
What an astute observation.  
---
Jesus, after posting, I just realized the length of the post.
---
PSA: The correct color wire changes every time. I've encountered 4 of these, of which 2 were successfully disarmed (with different color wires), and one was triggered with the same wire that disarmed the previous one.
---
I had found an Alice in wonderland looking encounter along with two mister handies talking 
---
These are the antithesis of fun.
---
I just completely avoid them now.
---
Hey man I'm fairly certain I have one (which i have no intention of using) I'd gladly give it up if you have plans for a big gun? if not, you can just have it. I'll be on tonight
---
Its worth it. Give in. Also if you're on xbox, get your serums from me :)
---
the dots i was talking about are fire, cause friggin super mutants throw mollies like a fat kid eats cookies
---
Lol sorry, nope good on the cores, have a bunch myself
---
The respawn map was empty for me too but i just fast travelled to them from the social menu. Initially it did not work as they were in the nuke zone but one of them stepped out of the nuke zone and I was able to spawn on him
---

---
Not that hard to imagine. I believe we're actively not too late. We only see the ones that didn't make it. You can see the desperation that even changed the BoS original ideals from helping people to ignoring then and securing whatever is necessary to deal with the scorched short of taking stuff by force. 
---
I believe we're not too late because the survivors are in hiding. The scorched are everywhere and only the ones that were damn good at disappearing have survived. Nothing short of killing them all will bring them out of wherever they've gone. This is what keeps me (my character) going. That belief that there are still people that need our help.
---
alrighty 😂
---
Interesting choice of words. Are you saying people who build their camp there are not legitimately playing the game?
---
Lol, ok, thanks for stopping by. 
---
Agreed, though when we get private servers I'm gonna want the current version of TSE weapons lol. But I should be able to mod my server to have that.
---
Scoped weapons and marksman rifles (hunting rifle, sniper, etc.)
---
TS weapons have always had bad accuracy, just as they did in F4. Seems fair to me for making whatever weapon much stronger.
---
The Warehouse build set is the blue/greyish corrugated sheet metal walls and such.

---
LOL I was wondering the origin of that troll dude 
---
I don't think anyone can debate such elegantly stated logic and persuasive arguments.
---
And you should read the title before posting shit like this.
---
So you are saying you do not like Fallout 76?
---
Unless the game decides to auto scrap hardened mass on you...
---
oh, I agree that it shouldn't affect legendary effect damage, but if that was taken away, then the 'Friendly Fire' perk wouldn't work with incindiary weapons either, and would limit them to only flamers, and well....flamers have the most expensive ammo per resources used when compared to dmg per ammo unit
---
Alright, I know this isn't the purpose of this thread, but...
---
This right here, which you point out as a positive, is what infuriates me so much about this game and it's current state. 
---
So much of this game is reused and recycled assets and systems that I'm honestly a little confused where so much time and effort went in to making this game. (Maybe it just didn't...)
---
daaang that sucks. i got a 35 tse assault rifle an tears stuff up i was kinda hoping the explosive part didn't scale all that much with the weapon. 
---
You’re welcome. 
---
I always give lower level player stuff, im alway running around with like 70 stimpaks and 50 super stimpaks so i just give people some, and give them some plans if i have any i cant learn
---
Pardon if any of this is already in the game. I'm looking to pick up sometime after a few of the DLCs come out.
---
1. Has the team considered revamping the VATS system so that it is something other than just an autoaimer? One way to do this might be to add a critical shot potential for using it or perhaps adding in the potential to evoke an animation in the opponent where they are either disarmed or temporarily stunned (headshot). This might allow the system to work in real time in a way that is somewhat consistent with how it was used in the SP games, if not in application then in result - damaging guns, damaging heads, etc.
---
2. What about revamping the hand-to-hand skill so that players can use it to hit and steal weapons from opponents in combat or stun them so that they can escape a desperate situation? Say someone uses VATS and blows a weapon from your hands. Instead of searching for it or scrolling through your menu (or running a certain distance away so it reloads into you inventory), maybe a very skilled player might charge an opponent and attempt to stun them so that they can run away or perhaps hit/stun them, take their weapon out of their hands and then try to use it against them. That might provide for some tension/excitement/fun to PVP. And it might also finally give a player a reason to practice/level-up this kind of skill (also a suggestion for TES6 combat improvement were few ever bother using the skill - maybe you are disarmed in combat: find your sword or attempt to take the enemy's or simply stun them and run away, the weapon reloading into inventory after you escape).
---
3. What about adding throwing weapons that have a special purpose so they are used - maybe to stun an oncoming opponent? Maybe the player is disarmed in combat and an opponent is rushing forward. Upon being disarmed, and if no other weapon is hotkeyed, it automatically switches the player to a throwing knife they've constructed previously; throw it at the opponent and have a chance to stun. Maybe this makes the opposition slightly more reluctant to rush a player who's out of ammunition until the situation is assessed. Also, this might incentivize players to wear armour rather than go naked and annoy everyone (armour reduces stun chance dramatically).
---
4. What about removing the level requirement for weapon usage? This seems artificial. In real life, I can attempt to use nearly any weapon, although probably with poor results. Maybe a large penalty could be assessed when using high-level weapons, instead. This would still give players something to work toward.
---
Also I've started using PA
---
The vendor fractions or their 200 caps limit isn't necessary a bad thing, especially once you have the correct setup for it. 
---
You can place a camp between all 7 factions, where it costs less than 10 caps to fast travel to any one of them. So after leaving one, I fast travel back to my camp (since its free, to avoid an even bigger price mark for fast traveling) then fast travel to the next location. I can wipe out all the vendors in less than 30 minutes, maybe 15 minutes, if I know exactly what I'm selling. 
---
The real problem with vendors is buying things from them. Nothing is wrong with the 200 caps, but the fact bethesda doesn't allow for it to go over 200 caps when you sell something, or all of the spent caps not going back into their inventory, it completely ruins the idea of bartering. It is the main reason, why I avoid buying stuff from vendors and just sell to them. I only buy from vendors when absolutely need to. I save my caps for when I'm trading with other players.  
---
I've been meaning to find out : For the chest piece, would ultralight be better than deep pocket, given the weight of the chest piece?
---
wait doesn't your CPU bottleneck the shit outta that 2070?
---
Str adds damage, so items or perks that add +str or dmg% are really good. Bloodied melee weapons are also really powerful 
---
they’re gonna screw it up, let’s be honest
---
I bet that second shot really helps a ton. I was honestly surprised at how worthless that 10mm was. It's strange that any level 5 weapon can outscale it with the same effect on it. 
---
Had a encounter with a robot in Savage divide that wanted a recon scope to do scientific research with.
---
That's not bad, but I **promise** you're still cutting people off from loot. That is a fact.
---
It’s not even Saturday night. 
---
Thank you. Now if you have a moment, another settlement needs our help.
---
FUCKING NUBS if you can't kill em yourself, you don't deserve the loot. Fucking leeches, I can't stand it. LV 20s running around whitesprings? FFS it takes everything I have to not shout obscenities over the mic.
---
Possible, but no one else went red to me (wouldn't his whole team have lit up, if not right away, then at least when I returned fire?).
---
Argh, it's annoying trying to narrow something down when there's a high chance the answer is "it's a bug you'll never detect."
---
Oohhh ok.
---
"Wait- you can get gonorrhea from a *ghoul*?!?
---
Actually it’s RNG. 
---
Today I scrapped an unmodded lvl 20 Combat Armor leg and unlocked Combat Helmet BoS mod...
---
Well the engine is over 20 years old. 
---
Bad comment is bad. 
---
That’s just wrong. It’s RNG. 
---
It does suck when the games only major boss fight is a 50/50 gamble on whether you'll DC mid way through the fight :/
---
Sort of thing that should have been hot fixed asap, Bethesda probably haven't got to that bit of there own game though ....if they even bother to play themselves :/
---
This the way it denotates that would affect the explosion because it's subsurface it typically has a lower effective yield. While firing a nuke would cause a detonation just above the surface thus higher effect. My sciencey 2 cents for the class 😀
---
I mean yeah, it is possible, but the more I threw stuff at him - every weapon, every damtype - the more I feel like, if some godmode exploit existed to prevent literally all damage, you KNOW people just wouldn't be able to shut up about it, someone would spill the beans and we'd all know.
---
I empathize with the bug comment, but his teammates don't have to be local for the damage resistance to be effective.
---
Yep, I did the quest. The realest possible. Nvm I guess.
---
Ugh I hate you.
---
I understand your point mate, but some of us have invested tons of hours playing this, grinding items just to have the best we could get, and that is ruined by some idiots dupping items, making every weapon we have worthless, even your ts 50cal machine gun it doesn't worth a lot by now.  
---
Still, don't worry, Beth won't wipe items, but if they do, I will be more than happy to help you recover your ts 50 cal machine.
---
Yall are messing with this dude..
---
For real Two Shot Explosive.
---
Just bought [this shirt](https://imgur.com/a/rNwNa9q) last week!  Shipped today! Lol
---
 Lol down voted because nobody wants their easy mode taken away? Rude. Have any upvote!
---
oh... i forgot... Go in to build mode and it should show the damaged as yellow in modify you can repair then... 
---
you spoilered it...
---
Protip: Always log out in PA or a hazmat if you:re in Whitesprings or the Bog.
---
There are some very effective ways- perk, armor/weapon  legendary abilities and of course tactics, that make the inexperienced fall, and the experienced much easier to deal with.
---
Don't worry, it's not actually very scary. There's some scorched and some bugs but that's it really. Nothing bad.
---
I was worried about that too at first. I'm not that great with creepy things. 
---
It's basically just a town like any other. With a museum dedicated to the mothman. But even that isn't that creepy. Decent amount of loot in it as well. 
---
There's a few places in 76 that I am creeped out going to (notably caves/mines). It has to be done though, I find in places like that I turn on Appalachia radio. That makes things so much better.
---
I perk card in Born Survivor covers your ass when healing factor is not active- it's often the only time you'll use a stimpack. If you have speed demon and marsupial you can get out of danger and caution and get it working in a nuke zone if you really need to.
---
There's a couple others, they're the "secret" silo exits.
---
They will be scaled similarly dmg wise. Although my Bloodied explosive gatling can do 4k+ dmg per shot, idkk if tse can achieve that
---
Yes.  Just bought it, CPU is 4 years old iirc.  Saving up to get a new motherboard and CPU now
---
Fair enough but I know a south side Dublin accent when I hear one :)
---
 Yeah I almost lost my armor. I logged out and restarted the game. Fixed it and didn't lose anything. 
---
Yeah I understand that first shovel should be made common item or more commonly found in world, but when polished and fixed, need to have shovel in inventory to dig treasures would be nice, more wasteland-like.
---
It's not quite what you're asking for, but if you have 9 charisma you can share rank 3 Inspirational and you both get an extra 15% XP. He'll still have to tag shit in order to get the XP, but it'll help him level up faster and hopefully narrow the gap.
---
Hmmm...
---
Looks like your account was made to hate on this game, and boast about having a PhD...
---
Let me make something clear. Coming to a place where people talk about, and enjoy a game just to hate on it makes no difference. I would like to know how much you have actually played before giving such extreme opinions about it. Please separate from the bandwagon, amd get your own opinion.
---
nobody mentioned dupes here, legit weapons exist 
---
Which is a shame, but it in no way excuses launching a multiplayer focused game in this state. And that doesn't even mention the utter void of content after you explore the map.
---
At one point for me, all 3 we're hovering in a field, in a line, about 10 feet off the ground... which was lava, apparently, because they never touched it.
---
Hah, that's not broken at all! It should require at least proximity if not LOS.
---
Well, that makes this more possible, then - since I wasn't looking at the whole map, just the nuke area. 
---
Still. ZERO damage? I guess, given the state of the game's broken mechanics, I should not dismiss the possibility...
---
would be funny if you could like run up and Radaway someone with a chance of clearing their mutations xD And a new meta is born!
---
TIL.
---
My bad.
---
I've been out of town... no idea whats going on atm.
---
Mines across from the overseers camp near the river. It’d becoming a popular place now lol
---
Patched with the 12/4 patch.
---
Ok, but I know and you know and everybody else knows that you will crawl back after you recover from your neurosis.
---
It's the people's mindset. End game - go to Whitespring, run around, get exceptional legendaries, make the running around and killing part faster, repeat.
---
So it's not just these people. They're doing what you're doing, in a different way.
---
Bethesda should either make nothing respawn at Whitespring or any farmable area, so people actually appreciate good items when they manage to get them and just play the game and explore, not run around in circles like chickens in the game god damn locations.
---
Wow, a gif has never encapsulated "Exit to Main Menu" as much as that one.

Brand new account? ✅

Sure smells like bad troll in here.
---
did you ever fix this? have the same problem.... 
---
I think you meant to reply to the guy above me.
---
This happens to me a lot. It’s not 100% but it’s often enough that it’s annoying. Also it can sometimes happen when I’m interacting with a vendor right after buying or selling something.
---
Did his name start with an A? I might know him
---
Omg, lose a couple of seconds just to let people tag mobs it is "KILL LESS EFFICIENTLY"? seriously?
---
Hello! It was a plague rat!
---
Yeah its annoying as hell. I often forget a couple of switches. Loadouts we could switch around are the obvious solution.
---
Upon looking into it that's the same model.
---
A non-hostile one can be found at the path to enlightenment event.
---
Similar and when I get in-game it's unplayable so much lag it's unreal
---
Not really the best idea considering we're all still getting 1 shotted by all the currently OP duped weapons. That would just introduce more weapons we could be 1 shotted with. They would need to beef up our defense or just remove certain affixes that are already OP on current weapons. Then release 55-60 weapons. 
---
Fusion cores are everywhere, I’m dropping 3 or 4 each time I play...... just find Power Armor and it will almost always have a core.
---
I sell serums on xbox for 300 each if that's doable. Send me a message if you're on xbox 
---
I feel like Roses New Gang event would actually make a great PvP event and would help start the hole faction wars in a way. You could either fight for Rose as a raider or join the enclave against the incoming raiders.
---
I agree with you. Honestly all the TSE weapons are duped and reduped weapons. They are all the same no extra affixs or stars just the same TSE .50 Pump, Double Barrel, Gauss all of them. It makes sense and its the meta now. It was going to be this way whether or not its duping or 3-4 months down the road.
---
Whatever. You're wrong but you keep thinking that.
---
It's RNG only for those body parts.
---
Im just here to educate my friend, no harm no foul :)
---
I had a Ms Nanny tell me a bedtime story
---
Mine never really landed...technically one of them landed on the helipad at the beginning of the fight, but it flew back up before I could even get a shot at it. From then on all three of them just flew around. Camp venture was a terrible spot to get attacked. But I have no clue how the fuck three of them managed to even be there...I've never seen a scorchbeast there before, let alone 3. There's a fissure site to the south but it's too far away for even the single scorchbeast from there to wander over
---
Sounds like fun
---
K bye
---
I figured I'd post here because I know a lot of people here follow the fallout lore mor than me
---
(Kills scorched) “democracy is non non-negotiable” I hope we get this it’s a awesome idea and I love it 
---
Not everyone was killed by the warheads. There were some survivors at locations far away from where the bombs landed, like in Appalachia.
---
I’d like to see something like this develop as they release new content. A large part of this game that I think is overlooked is the ability to add onto the lore and explain more as the game expands.  
---
It did for me last night.  Somebody had one of those back-door camps that had turrets in it.  Some ghouls came out which aggro'd the turrets - which them aggro'd on me.  I tried to shoot them, but pacifist prevented any and all damage.  Ended up just shutting the back door and running to the front to kite all of the enemies away from the back.
---
Block then via game.
---
I mean the auto melee are worse and are a problem itself 
---
I was going to say the Overseer, since... She's the only character in the game.  But I want to see the Mysterious Stranger show up to save you and trip, spraining his ankle.  You then get his whole story during a few quests to regrow a leg.
---
same user name?  
---
Lol nice one
---
This seems like sound logic.
---
Mine is generally always on.  I only turn it off when I want to deliberately go after somebody.

ow, poor baby, no one helps him throw such a difficult game, oh he is mad and he will always be mad with all because he didn't receive love.

wait until Bethesda change this stupid PvP system and I will be more than happy to kick your ass.
---
You sir, can have all my upvotes. Sign me right the fuck up for some if it’s red it’s dead. 
---
How do I get it on PS4
---
Each of the Free States bunkers has a generator, and one of them (Ella's I think) has one that spawns on a table as well.
---
Or a Mac?
---
It means a whole bunch. Like midway between a million and a brazilian.
---
Lmao calm down jesus. These are a couple ideas out of thousands people have. Bethesda probably already has a lineup of what they have planned.
---
They aren't going to reply to every suggestion post either.
---
And if the game isn't fun for you now, it likely won't be in the future, either
---
Approaching 100, but I'm "finalizing" my build (since i kinda put perks into fuck all the whole game) while farming for XP...namely nuking Whitespring or FSP. Roleplaying as Brotherhood is also super fun.
---
GT is AngelOfDeath116 however I'm at work for 5 more hours. I'll gladly hook you up when I get home 
---
Two players showed up at my base and asked them if they needed anything as they draw their guns and I hear "yeah, got any copper?" I ended up selling them some copper ore, some of my 308 ammo and a spare power armor frame for 500 caps, plus some stims, water, a handmade rifle
---
No i agree. I said it before and ill say it again. As long as people continue to buy and support these games the devs will be more than happy to keep pumping them out. 
---
I didn't know you could join a non-friend's session on Xbox. In PS4 you can't 
---
So the game is quite glitchy and you are gonna add your shitty part to the formula to make it even worst, a nice player ladies and gentlemen.
---
I see your point. If killing him isn't an option then server hopping is the easiest solution.
---
It's a Nintendo switch exclusive
---
It wasn't that they were stupid, it was just that they sounded like two random people you might meet on the street corner in any given North American city. xD   It was like the 'acting' part just consisted of reading lines, rather than embodying the characters.
---
I felt like FO4's character voices typically had much more... well, character. Haha.
---
Shame because Saturday nights alright for fighting. 
---
If that Targeting HUD scraps to Black Titanium, it's for Excavator
---
Nice.

No u. 
---
There's gotta be Skyrim hidden in there somewhere. No platform left unported, even the universe itself.
---
I wish to know! Teach me!
---
Yea?Well I dont even need Beth to change the system because i one shot any player without being in combat with them with my 2se Dragon.And even if you'd have a weapon good enough to kill me , do you think weapons , loot and caps are a problem to me after all this duping?
---
I had this last night. I had just rebuilt my CAMP and set up the tables.
---
First I thought i had them in spots the animation couldn't process correctly, but i had to actually fast travel to Vault 76 and then back. I wish I knew what caused that.
---
I gave up after that. It’s sad because I love this game but it is kind of making a bit unplayable in terms or sbq or nuke zones which is what I love doing , except I know I’m gong to dc and I’ll be screwed unless I’m in a group .
---
They have got to do return to server it’s driving me utterly crazy!!!! 
---
Ye
---
Whaaaat. What system are you on because I would LOVE to have one of those for my outfit! 
---
What are you talking about, what happened in 2076 besides the completion of the vault?
---
I need to go back again. 2 mirelurk kings, some razorclaws and some normal mirelurk were a bit too much for my lvl 26.
---
I managed to kill 1 king, after dying 3 times and using up my stimpaks. 
---
Seeing the other mirelurk king in the distance was a bit too much.
---
Lost a bunch of good loot there too. Couldn't find it anymore.
---
That was you? I think I was in the same world and got booted, happened a little while ago.
---
That just started harrowing to me too, last night. I was server hopping, looking for the plans for the T-51b jetpack and suddenly the game crashed in the bots menu. 
---
Mothman can turn up anywhere, although I have never yet encountered him. 
---
You'll get used to the creatures though, to some extent or other. A few freaked me out to start with but they don't really bother me much now. I think once you have dealt with them once or twice it is less scary. It's more the thought. 
---
Happens alot lol
---
If someone tries to kill you ; you kill them right back 
---
One does not level up past Blade of Bastet's usefulness - it can be used as a crafting material to create higher level versions of itself!

Who is taking workshops?

Go do Census Violence in the bog.

My bad! there are spaces:  Irish Mr Kiwi

I just bought a TSE pump in watoga for next to nothing. I couldn't believe the person infront of me sold it, I'm looking for mods and decent plans etc. And I saw that and couldn't believe it
---
Working as intended :/
---
\#slowclap Bethesda
---
Ive met mothman and killed him but he still scares me, hes the worst one ive seen, hopefully all the others are less scary due to him
---
\#SarcasmAlert. you can be whoever you want to be, I just hope Bethesda change this stupid PvP system so I can also show you who I want to be.
---
I can do a pretty offputting pirate impression, or sound like a jubilant little kid. So I guess if u wanna play with the most notorious swashbuckler in Virginia, or a grown man possessed by the spirit of little Timmy, then I’m down to clown.

---
Good to know  I was too scared to try it.
---
I’m avoiding meta analysis.  My post is using only in-world references to Fallout 76, rather than analyzing the concepts of videogames or simulations or bugs. 
---
Hell, there are buildings in Watoga you can enter by walking through a wall, and swim from ground floor to roof. No glitch involved.  
---
If I wanted to be critical, the ability for me to step inside of the void in my power armor, and reappear as though from a fourth dimension would be evidence itself, but I ignore this because it’s not a narrative choice.
---
Literally me 
---
Problem is alot of these stories are I came across two playes with a bag between them, so according to what I have read they must be duping!! Which is where the misinformation comes from, my own example from my previous post is a good example. I have read other posts which is basically, server started lagging so I looked on the map for two people standing by each other usually one is much higher level than the other, travelled by them and saw them standing with a bag in between them , so BAM attacked because they were duping. I also dont know anyone who is going to sit and watch someone for an hour in game to see if they are duping
---
Lol I was one shotting people long before duping became a problem or even whispered in the dark corners. The problem is the shit PvP they introduced. 
---
Doesn’t it do that every time even when you aren’t near a stash box
---
Ultra sloth, emperor mirelurk, Mole-bear horde with mole Miner Director, invisi-go the unseen terror, less of this tiresome sorched beasts.  I'm so sick of them, they are just time consuming bullet sponges not a challenge once you're in PA with some diluted stimpaks.
---
Is it not autopopulated at all crafting stations? 
---
Okay so with your comment i may see what I'm missing. So the vault was completed in 2076, and people went in for 25 years, and they came out expecting the world to be normal still?
---
Yeah I got that. 
---
Well... FO76 takes place in 2102....  not 2076.  The vault was completed in 2076 at the 300th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.   Technically we are leaving the vault 25 years after the war.  But yeah... not everything or everyone died.  Plenty of places in the US not worth nuking...  North Dakota....  but the war lead to complete chaos.  Does this explain what you were asking?
---
T-60 Shocks are gone already
---
Hey, if people can't handle the truth it's not my problem. Thanks for the upvote though.
---
I like your idea of passive perk slots. Originally I just thought it would be nice if after getting the card it would simply be unlocked, but I dig this more. There's still balancing that a player has to choose but it makes it so that combat/other cards don't "fight" one another.
---
Maybe one slot could unlock every ten levels, so by level 50 you have all five "passive" slots unlocked.
---
How long ago was this and the obviously haven’t fixed your characters yet?
---
I was under the impression that the bombs fell in 2076, right around Halloween. 
---
I don’t want to analyze anything Todd Howard said, as I am using the evidence provided by Bethesda that you as a character can find in game.
---
Evidence is placed in game for a reason, even if the purpose is to mislead us. But it’s not accidental.
---
How about we let everyone voice their opinions and give their suggestions and feedback for the game?
---
Don't be so entitled.
---
Lure them into a long hallway out fitted with plasma mines,
---
These and all cards pertaining to crafting/repairing...
---
What is the general rule?  I've only ventured there twice when it's been all blown up, first time at a low level and got destroyed by the mobs, second time at level 55 didn't die but wasn't sure if just killing a ton of high levels is the whole point.  I found the garden wall near the pool and that helped but the ghouls kept spacing out and running away from me.  I probably killed about thirty and ended up with two lame legendaries, a pick axe and an assault rifle.   One guy ran up to me and asked to trade but didn't offer to anything and then ran away.   
---
Well, the person who normally would one-shot the mob wants to tag it too, right? So you're expecting them to carry an intentionally less powerful backup weapon, tag mobs with it, and wait for other people to finish them off.
---
I dunno, that seems stupid. Like, I'm a stealth sniper, one shotting things is my whole reason to exist. I guess this conversation isn't about me because I try not to be in the same area as other players at all, but I think you have unrealistic expectations for how people should play.
---
Hmm interesting 
---
Fallout 4 is set in 2287, 210 years after the bombs drop
---
If this was an mmo there would be hundreds of players per server, but there's 24-32
---
Wouldn't worry to much Bethesda clearly don't take anything from this sub seriously :P
---
I installed the perk loadout manager mod. I cannot play without it. I will not play without it actually. 
---
Maybe if the UI was more responsive. But more often than not I try to click on a card to equip/unequip it and it doesn't do shit because I clicked too fast from the previous card. But I've already hit tab to close the menu before realizing it didn't take. 
---
That's what I've found. But I was low. Thanks to him/her I can find them as I go again.
---
Is that like... Attacking me openly? Like... A murderer? 
---
Agreed that the PvP is broken but what we're you 1 shotting with that wasn't explosive or 2 shot? 
---
The perks out weight the negatives for me. I have a decent pc though, consoles and queen looks like mess last I seen
---
Yeah, I didn’t know at the time that they were all over the place. McClintock has maybe six that respawn. Before I found out there were other reliable places to find bags I would make special trips to McClintock every ten hours or so of gameplay. Oh well!
---
I put those in box at White Springs before I craft, sometimes I forget and do the Homer Simpson---Doh
---
Bugs aren't part of artistic integrity, so if you're talking about that kind of stuff when you mention 'game after game', then you're in the wrong place. 
---
As far your main two points, I disagree. I don't find FO76 to be grindy, as there is no requirement to kill/level up to do anything particularly relevant to the game's basic loop... which is explore, loot, craft. You can take it nice and easy and slow and there are really no repercussions, nor is it filled with super spongy enemies that take forever to die (this can happen but, at least for me, it's infrequent and usually a sign I shouldn't be in the place I'm in due to level differences).
---
As to your further point about unlocking perks, well, unlocking quality of life upgrades through character progression is pretty normal in many games. Especially in survival games where stuff like carry weight matters. I've never been bothered by it.
---
I think mistakes were made in areas like marketing and QA, but again, those have nothing to do with the point of the thread. The rest is artistic integrity, meaning I offer suggestions for improvement but respect that they are the devs and I am the consumer, not the other way around.
---
I remember my buddy and I came across a nuke and he asks what wire to cut. Ran a bit away and said “in the movies it’s always the blue wire!” And he asked if I was sure. I went behind a tree and said. “Totally. Movie logic is sound.” We got lucky.

What are you storing? Mines at 400 (give or take) out of 600 and even that's mostly junk. Try scrapping your non legendary weapons and armour, you'll get all of it again and better. Also sell any legendaries that aren't 50 that you're not using. You may also wanna sort out your ammo, missiles, cores and nukes are useless. Only keep 3 or 4 of each core and a few nukes if you're going to use the Fatman. 
---
no worries, I probably won't be on until 10pm EST.  I'll look you up.  Thanks.
---
I’ll play! GT: TaxmanMSU 
---
33 male..
---
I'm willing to look past the somewhat dated visuals, the wonky animations and strange hitboxes.
---
Yet the game does it best to make me hate it.
---
* It crashes about every two hours
---
* Bugs with not being able to leave Power Armor
---
* I've spent half my playtime looking forward to getting a Gatling Plasma, even managed to get a Two-Shot off of some robot - the gun is useless, it doesn't register half the shots and breaks after a single Plasma Core (that's with Gunsmith 5 and the Luck perks)
---
* End game consists of a meaningless grind and/or changing servers
---
* After fast traveling it freezes for about 5 seconds
---
* Energy guns are virtually useless, except the Gauss Rifle. My Anti-Armor, +50% Limb Damage Ultracite Laser can't even one shot Lvl 3 Ghouls
---
* No interesting Nuke events, a single bullet sponge "boss"
---
* I'm sick of the randomness of loot - I've been through every single location and yet don't even have Combat Armor plans above light
---
I could go on.
---
Its auto populated all the time, no matter where you are. You could be miles from a stash box. The only requirement is upon entering a new server you need to look at your stash box once to register it. 
---
I can see the yellow but I can't repair. 
---
I haven’t played in a while, but I believe it’s L1 in your Pip-boy. 
---
Is there a way to trade cards? I don’t think there is, but then again I keep finding out about mechanics I never heard of or skipped over by accident (I’m embarrassed by how long it took me to find out about bulk wrapping scrap)
---
That’s something that really needs implementing if it’s not possible, that’s the whole point of trading cards! You trade them!
---
I'm running a 8700k/1080Ti, the game is just unstable.
---
Yes however it some times bugs out in witch case run up stash and hit r (pc) and it should work as intended again
---
10pm EST is exactly when i get out of work. Go ahead and add me 
---
Need to add your platform/console.
---
They are damn near mandatory for anyone looking to play this game seriously. They need to be nerfed, or the perks nerfed.
---
I’m later getting home today than I’d like, but when I do I’ll make a quick recon of the area (I’ve not actually been there yet, but it’s down the road from my last location), and then message you. If you figure out a way to escape the hordes or fast travel away before then, let me know. Best luck!
---
crafting is stupid. you have a level up perk system to get crafting ability's like in skyrim, but you also have a blueprint system where blueprints are expensive and rare AND HAVE WEIGHT similar to games like dying light but dumber because you penalize the players for having blueprints with the weight system.  you also ofc need materials for crafting and mods, some of which are very rare and the whole breaking down items to learn mods. 
---
then amount of time, perk invest, materials, and carrying around those blue prints is not worth the thing you get to make. you can just run around killing things until you get what you want randomly and thats actually quicker to do, and funner to do then crafting, plus you can just sell all the blueprints and not have to carry them. 
---
crafting anything in fallout 76 is just not worth doing at all. have blue print system or have perks but not both, and remove weight form blueprints and all of a sudden crafting isnt a complete waste of time and carry weight. 
---
or just dont and we can all go play better games
---
Good job stopping him; the sooner we get a massive ban wave removing all glitch abusing players and youtubers and streamers the better.
---
For English not being your native tongue you wrote that very well and straight forward. Thought you might like to know.
---
Hey gatekeeper, I got my explosive combat shotgun legit off a super mutant horde and I uave every right to use it whenever I want.
---
Well, this is news to me, I must have had it glitched for a couple of sessions cause I had to have a stash box for it to populate my mats! Thanks guys!
---
Crowfall is a game in alpha where the story is you are /a/ hero, one of many chosen champions.
---
Much better basis to work off of for a multiplayer game.
---
It's the strongest material mod for marine armor, and it can be unlocked by scrapping. Never seen it in a vendor.
---
I don’t want PvP in the game at all. I don’t care about losing that player base. Especially not wit the duping situation as it is. PvP is NOT wanted.
---
Definately interested if you could upload its location. Thanks 
---
Im too low of a level for like any form of power armor lmao, I have a frame for future use however
---
Go to robotics and you can walk through any blue dot on the wall. If you go to the left-hand wall on top of the boxes walk-through that blue dot and you’ll fall through the map and land on the scientific wing, I know 100% this does work for PS4
---
&gt;mmo style games **like this**
---
This game is an mmo lite. It's an mmo style game.
---
Tbh I have no issues with the atom store itself but I also think why TF would people spend real money? We're literally given atoms all the time. I have nearly 5000 atoms, even though I never try intentionally to get them, and having only spent about 500 on some lights. I do kinda wish I'd got the blackbird paint though (was 1800 I think?). That's a lot but I'd still have about 3000 atoms right now.
---
Most the items are a bit meh but... good lol makes it easier to save up. Although I'd definitely like the new skins for the workbenches and the race car bed for my garage.
---
The game has only been out a couple of months. I'm gonna accumulate a lot more atoms and end up with everything eventually.
---
Aren't they from the other vaults? The only 76 inhabitants are players
---
It's mostly due to the incredible lack of balance in weapons that PvP is kind of an issue. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I always have fun at the Monster Mash and whenever someones has a bounty on their head...well...call me Sheriff. It's just that the PvP right now is either a complete one-sided steamroll or barely existant. This kinda stems back to the duping of TSE Legendaries saturating the Wasteland so everyone just kinda one-shots each other or decimates their bases within maybe 2 or 3 seconds. 
---
I would love a true PvP experience but, as it is now, I would much rather avoid it with randoms because I have no absolute idea how it's gonna play out. The guns and Legendary effects just need an extreme rework or different effects when applied towards players because it's just not fun for the strong majority of people.
---
Yeah dude. you are preaching to the quoir (sp?). I quit at lvl 30. Besides all the bugs you just listed its contentless and boring! 
---
Hello hello, that may have been myself as Admanski 😁
---
Sorry I wrecked your buzz that day.. feel free to add me 😁😁😁😁
---
I love it, it's got an incredibly cool look to it, and it's super unique! I don't believe I've ever seen that location myself, but great work on the CAMP!
---
bombs fell  October 23, 2077  I think you might be misremembering something.
---
Alot of people will ask which platform others play on so instead of that question coming up all the time it would be nice to just have the platform show as flair next to users names.  Reddit flair is a subreddit specific text that will show next to your name.  Next to my name right now I have the Mothman flair.  Depending on how you view Reddit you may not see the flair though.
---
I made it out with the tiniest bit of luck, my game was a bit bugged out and thats why i couldnt escape
---
Usually the vendor at Harpers Ferry. Very hard to get. 
---
I changed it to white so it was easier to see. I also changed the color of the pipboy light to white and it is much brighter. 
---
managed a radium on my latest attempt to farm for the handmade plans at patrol duty, one down eh?
---
Haha. Don't feel too bad. It's a very common misconception. Enjoy the shocks!
---
Lets be honest, Pvp was terrible from the get go. Very disappointing.
---
Random question, what effect does stacking Nukes have? 
---
No , The Vault stood empty until late the next year in 2077 when the bombs fell and all the assigned Vault residents went to the Vault for safety.
---
I think you misunderstand what I believe.
---
I think that you, the player character, is in a simulation.  
---
Any (dead) NPC that died before you emerged from Vault 76 isn’t a real actor hooked up to the simulation, but instead a plot detail.
---
It is possible that some NPC’s or even all of them were in the simulation or dead, but, it seems even more unlikely.
---
The simulation itself does not need to be a pre-war simulation.  We could be in a simulation at any point post-war.  We could be in an Enclave Simulation.  We could be in an Institute Simulation.  We could be in a Brotherhood Simulation.
---
I say this because there are not reliable actors and narrators within Fallout 76 who are trustworthy.
---
One thing is clear, is that the creators of this simulation are aware of the existence of the Enclave, the Brotherhood, and other California based locations that we’ve seen before.  This implies, at least, that this simulation is occurring post-war, or that all of Fallout history is simulated.
---
Vault 76 was completed in 2076.
---
Bombs dropped in October 2077, and everyone entered the Vault.
---
25 years later (2102), Vault 76 opens and the rebuilding begins.
---
They're quiet, probably still in duck n' cover mode.
---
Duping is still most certainly a thing and they should be perma-banned.
---
Pre-war money and a copy of that painting of him on the horse.
---
I am 
---
But duper’s don’t have enough room to store their thousands of duped junk....
---
It's cause you're doubling recoil. The gun simultaneously fires twice. 
---
Splitting hairs
---
thank you very much
---
thank you :D
---
we got answers :D
---
Usually when you first load in you’ll have to look at a stash box for the game to load all your stuff but after that you can craft anywhere 
---
Personally, I'm fine with PvP.  I think smashing someone's camp is just a prick move though.  Especially if it's one that has some time into it.
---
But my honest opinion on PvP right now... in this game... it's garbage.  As long as TSE weapons exist it will always be garbage.  The way it stands... whoever shoots first usually gets one shot in return.  Then the revenge starts, and you can just respawn and one shot the person that killed you.  Rinse and repeat... that's not PVP... 
---
Oh, and all of that assumes the other player doesn't spawn invisible...
---
In my opinion, PvP is an OPTION in this game, not it's sole purpose.  It's a survival game... if you choose to make that survival harder on others, by all means, you are more than capable.  So, you can't say that PvE suggestions that hinder PvP are a bad thing...  PvP is not the game's primary focus... simply something you can do in said game.
---
If only your senior leadership cared to join it.  But they’re totally AWOL.  What is the vision going forward if Howard, et al are off the grid?  Is the game dead to them now?
---
ahh ok got ya!  
---
I'd go for full reset once the game is out of alpha,  IDGAF.
---
Guess I might bite and buy it then. 
---
I literally asked this question the saw how to do flairs lol only just clicked
---
Yes. I agree. I am just asking for people to be more sincere with their feedback.
---
Ive had conversations with people posting threads about PVP changes. 2 questions in and they admit: They dont PvP, They dont like PvP, and They dont want it in the game. 
---
Please dont post feedback that ruins PvP just because you dont like pvp. That isnt honest feedback, and most of the people in the Subreddit hold those opinions. 
---
How can you give feedback on a game feature you dont use? - thats the point of my post.
---
How? It is literally an MMO lite. An already established sub genre of the MMO with plenty of similar games like it.
---
All the explosive and grenades perks I believe 
---
&gt;Bethesda launcher
---
That's just sad. I was hoping to gift these to a friend.
---
Was the industrial water purifier at the Scrapyard in the southwest a fluke? did they remove it? I don't see anyone in here talking about it but i loved claiming that workshop for all the junk extractors and the water purifier it came with (which seemed to produce 5 water WAY faster than "normal" industrial purifiers)
---
My roommate did something similar to me once. My friends and I used to play L4D2 kind of obsessively when it was new. In the middle of one such session I kept hearing a witch. Nobody else was hearing the witch so after a few minutes I began to question my sanity. There was no witch. I'd looked for it. I was the only one hearing it.
---
Turns out Roommate had downloaded a L4D2 soundboard and was just randomly playing the "With nearby" noise in places where he knew a witch could be in the level. 
---
Should I join you?
---
Lvl 106 ps4 - always down to farm xp at the golf course. Psn 👉 ignoremeow (add me and send a msg, I don't bite. I  just smoke alot of herb)
---
You obviously no nothing about software development.
---
No doubt it is, still playable though. When you loose a bit of progression it sucks, but it's not that big of a deal. So far I have yet to see any rollbacks on items, that would be game breaking. 
---
 And the water supply.
---
What's even more surprising is that they they promised they would become more open and better at communicating with there customers, threw a few more bundles on the Atom store then fell of the face of the earth...someone should go and check on them make sure there alright tbh!
---
Yes that was likely me.  I did however get some really nice screenshots. :)
---
Aye.  "Most used" over alphabetical would be nice.
---
Actually, perk loadouts would be nicer, but I'll take what I can get!
---
Lol...
---
System?
---
Another upvote.
---
I found an explosive fletchette harpoon gun on vendor at Watoga. The first time I shot it I laughed out loud.
---
Yeah, it's kinda fun, and really funny, but how anyone can think this is how the game should be/is healthy for a multiplayer game environment like this so so far beyond me.
---
Added :)
---
So concentrate on Int for PA perks and percep for riffle perks. Throw 3 points into Lucas at least for Bloody Mess that give a flat 15% increase to any damage. I would throw at least 3 points into str for weight reduction perks or increase in carry weight. Rest is really up to you. 
---
it may not let you if they have to have support... repair from bottom up...
---
Sure!
---
Add me: paulofg1980
---
Ill be in game tomorrow around this hour, maybe a bit earlier. 
---
If you're sure, i'm literally going to buy the protected plan tonight despite already knowing it, then server hop for however long it takes to see it.  I'm just not going to go through that without confirmation.
---
1 stim + pw = 2 diluted stims
---
1 stim + pw + chemist perk = 4 diluted stims
---
1 stim + pw + Chemist and super duper perks = 8 diluted stims (up to 30% chance)
---
I never run out of stims now and I also use the first aid perk to have my stims be 45% more effective.
---
Exactly... New server, just look in your stash so it loads and ur good. 
---
Strength builds give you the most end game options. You'll have access to melee, unarmed, shotgun, or heavy guns.
---
Plus inventory management sucks and strength gives you more. 
---
Yep, and I'm waiting for some clarity from Bethesda before I waste any time on mods.
---
Let someone else have at it for awhile. :)
---
Grahm
---
I'll try not to die on my way back from my next salvaging mission.....
---
I'm in the same boat. I have a legit level 50 2 shot explosive shotgun that I will not mess with or trade etc. Sadly I don't think it matters, pretty sure Bethesda did not put unique IDs on all items. 
---
I stopped playing about a month ago when there were several methods of duping being advertised on youtube.
---
If Bethesda perma banned those who actively participated in duping and removed all the current dupes, I would come back(despite other concerns).
---
Other than personal preference better range, handling, ammo consumption, breaks less and I believe does more damage. 
---
I've always wondered if it was just me or others that get the boot.  Now if only we had a "Return to Last Server" button.  &lt;facepalm&gt;
---
It works if you’re the one sharing the card, but if someone’s sharing to you is the problem
---
Excellent. I wasn't actually doing the event, I was just grinding out 😂😂 I'll be online within the hour 😁
---
\^ This.
---
I believe its Gorilla Zoe's "Hood Nigga".
---
Found them while running for my life away from some deathclaws and an assaultron that was WAY higher level then me.... I died listening to the conversation. 
---
I understand what you are saying. But to be honest, this subreddit is mostly fine.
---
I used to post on the official forums before coming here, and *that* is just ridiculous. People called PvPers psychopaths, they compared us with school shooters... it was really bad.
---
Bethesda received a lot of heat when they announced PvP for the game and they still pushed through; I'm sure they have their own plans for this aspect of the game.
---
I set up all the extractors with locks, turrets and a fusion generator at the Charleston landfill just to get disconnected.
---
Was very disappointed 
---
I fucking r e f u s e to stand idly by and watch you get downvoted for this. Fuck these god damn fucking fan boys. 
---
Could you make me one i need one
---
Not charging but if you have any of the materials I listed I would appreciate it
---
Play an actual pvp game for pvp? PVP in this game is a very niche tacked on mess and not taken seriously by anyone.
---
Bloodied melee is Very good. I've essentially got a bloodied build rn myself but you'll want nerd rage and serendipity at a minimum. 
---
They need a total redeisgn or just remove from game. They serve no purpose atm. 
---
I’ve found that this happens if one workbench is too close to another. Moving them apart fixes it for me every time. 
---
Just go into build mode and store the hostile one and then replace it. 
---
I have had this happen to me when reclaiming public workshops. 
---
Alright thanks man
---
Ive heard Grenadier doesnt work havent tested for my self though. Demolition Expert 100% works
---
Bethesda has said they don't care if you use graphic mods and such just as long as they don't give a unfair advantage 
---
Sent you a friend request 😊
---
Got spices, may have salt and pepper. Should I join you?
---
Been living here for a while now, but I live like a hobo. Need to follow your ideas! 
---
I stopped picking locks and hacking terminals. I've unlocked to many locked chests to find only a pencil and dirty water or even nothing at all in some. Hacking is the same. I've hacked to many only to find after entering whatever area it locked you out of that there is a hole in a wall you could have walked through instead. Both perks appear to be completely useless in 76
---
Just hop back into the matrix chair.
---
Thanks for the help I'll be sure to do this!!
---
The thing is I was capable of putting up with all the jank while I still had locations to explore.
---
But the game was essentially over for me once I visited the last unexplored place - there's absolutely nothing to do afterwards.
---
No it’s “Molly Cyrus” by Stitches 
---
Radiant quests?
---
I've had the opportunity to play around with almost erervy weapon in a TSE variant and still own most and they are all broken.
---
Best way to fix it should be to cut the damage bonus from explosive by 40-75% introduce the other damage effects from F4 like bleed and burn (seriously, I bet they're still in the game files) and balance them all against each other.
---
Then just add either perk cards or a legendary armor effect that reduces the damage you take from this group of damage effects.
---
I don’t think I’ve tried that (at a Power Armor station). Let me try that tonight.
---
If that works, that might be a noteworthy detail to add - that this has to be done at a station. I struggled with inventory space for 15 levels!!
---
Perhaps different boards? One board for Combat/stealth/health, one for utility/crafting/junk
---
I’m talking like store in your inventory. Can it be not on your map and in your inv?
---
I agree that there are balance issues. I would love to be talking about balance issues &amp; fixes with other PvPers.  Thats what we should be doing.
---
I just dont think the conversations coming from this sibreddit are productive or sincere. Take a look at any highly upvoted PvP thread from here and ask "How will this help the PvE community"
---
Yeah I only bought the the bos statue at 500 and the camo paint i still got 2800 lol 
---
In my opinion, PvP damage should be calculated in a completely different way from PvE. 
---
It should take way more bullets to kill someone, so they have time to react and put up a *real* fight.
---
I've stopped claiming any of those till this is resolved.  I've had that happen to many times to be viable right now.
---
Does it remove rad from nuka cola?
---
Prove you linked a video 
---
I am on xbox looking to get twisted muscles and any other thats good for a melee build.
---
  Already have mar. And chameleon I bought mar. From a player took a chance and rad my self and got the chameleon while trying for Tm but got worried I would get a mt that would screw up my build. 
---
     
---
The economy is saturated with duplicate 2 shot explosive weapons. People wanting to trade or participate in PvP are actually kind of effected...
---
Having a respawning cap stash and chem box is a much better way to earn caps the way I do by smelting copper my extractor digs up and selling it for a mere 17 caps.
---
Your poll is missing the one option that can truly Lead Us to The Light.
---
Did yourcamp happen to be round the back of white springs golf course with a load of missile turrets?
---
I mean, it was the holidays. My company didn't talk to many customers the past few weeks either 
---
The OP of that spreadsheet noted this too. The suspicion is that if a weapon has the mod, you have a low chance to learn it even if you can’t normally. The other way is plans, they can teach you mods you can’t get via scrapping. That second method is how I learned all of my .50 receivers.
---
i sent in my ticket a month ago now still no response
---
Consider doing it alone. Its not that difficult. Take plenty stimpaks and circuitry. I launched a nuke solo at site Alpha. 
---
When will you be doing this? 
---
This is correct
---
Wasn't there a Yao guai den mother briefly visible in one of the DLCs for new Vegas? Iirc she was goddamn huge. Maybe it's time we kill it. 
---
I think a couple plans and some unique-ish meat. Hearts and lungs or something.
---
Oh iv never bothered with that flux stuff , I’m level 87 and the only thing I want to craft that needs it is the decontamination shower 
---
Yeah, I agree. As it is now, it's just one-shotting all around.
---
You can use the frame now.  You can get raider armor for it at level 15.
---
Apparently another big patch slated for January. Try again in February?
---
I cannot give you a verified definite answer, but I can tell you the first nuke I ever went to was a triple nuked Prime and there were so many enemies I honestly couldn't see more than 10ft through the mounds of scorched, Mirelurk, yao guai, and various other creatures. I've never seen a nuke zone nearly that densely populated since.
---
I just found this one today! I was confused as to why there was a death claw nest in the middle of the road.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5c23c13&amp;d=ic4ih2lt2c62ib3sa2s01pd2pk2pp2pl2ee0&amp;w=&amp;n=Swiss%20cheese
---
Something like this
---
But non-combat perks can be swapped out when needed. This essentially means you can swap out non combat perks where needed and doesn't really give your character a "role" or choice of non combat perks.
---
One solution would be to make it more difficult or punishing to swap perk cards, but that would likely lead to people just ignoring most non-combat perks in favour of powerful combat perks. 
---
We need a system that
---
1. Seperates non-combat perks from combat perks.
---
2. Have separate perk slots for non combat vs combat perks. For example at level 3 intelligence you could have level 3 Nerd Rage equipped in combat slots. But you also have 1 or 2 non-combat perk slots for something like Hacker.
---
3. Charge caps for switching non-combat perk cards. (Combat perks arent an issue since it's not particularly abusive to switch those around)
---
I want it.
---
This is the spot where I found the witch and skeleton guy and this nuke several times, I cut the red wire the first time but when I cut the red wire the second time it blew up
---
For the gauss you'll want the demolition perk and the semi auto rifle perks. that's it. Things like bloodied mess and adrenaline boost damage too 
---
Around 45
---
Absolutely. Even if it is something simple as "Legendary effects are disabled during PvP".
---
Indeed. Still, I believe it can be improved (a lot) so it can be a fun aspect of the game.
---
Fair. I’d prob have to hear it. 👍
---
Maybe, there's a ton of interesting games coming out in the next 3 months though.
---
Thanks man, I’ll get them on 
---
Pure creature comfort?  Dude, my armor is lined with toilet paper and pre-war money.  Best sources of cloth in the game!
---
Will remember this if they return
---
Toxic Larry’s Meat and go, 3 Snallygasters spawn every time and drop 2-5 acid each
---
I think it lets you come onto the same server.
---
Bloodied build with power armor is the easier version. This is a pretty good guide:
---

---
Excavator has Emergency Protocols too, if you want to lug more stuff around.
---
Rog, grab the cat!!!!
---
It shouldn't be, but not because of the perk. 
---
The amount of explosive damage that's applied at base is the problem. A 100% boost to an already high effect is what makes explosive guns generally extremely strong- without the perk. 
---
Pure explosive weapons aren't great without the perks. Do some research before you fire off solutions. 
---
As far as I know, you can’t store your camp in your inventory. 
---
You done enclave quest line?
---
Yeah, that's what I meant. You don't have that option on PS4.
---
Nah, mine was around whitesprings but a good distance outside with no turrets of any kind.
---
I have some but they are in my second character I'll trade for a 10mm level 25 or other low level stuff haha
---
My situation is worse than yours. I'm such a noob I can't be bothered to take them OUT of my set so I do Jack shit for damage but at least I have max lockpicking and hacking.
---
This suggestion needs to become top priority.
---
I'd also highly recommend the intelligence perk that makes energy ammo weigh 90% less. 2mm cartridges are heavy 
---
damn. Does it dissappear when you log off?
---
HEY! We don't insult pencils! After all, they're filled with glorious LEAD
---
If they are being cutthroat, run in front of them and take the resulting free junk.
---
My sweet summer child...
---
Yeah it's chemist and super duper that make it worthwhile to dilute..  not sure what he's saying anyway, 2 purified water heal more than a stimpack?  Is it even affected by First Aid?
---
There is one in game. Under the lights category.
---
Nah lol doesn't matter either tbh
---
No amount of coding creates good customer service, if it did even that would be buggy though coming from Bethesda!
---
Are you making the claim that the BethSoft that made the old TES games and the BethSoft that made the massive sewer-blockage that is Fallout 76 are in any way comparable?
---
I'm guessing  energy perks dont work right?  Also is the crossbow part of the Rifleman perks
---
Location/time zone &amp; is this dedicated playthru or just group up when we happen to notice each other online?
---
It’s what I did. Are you on PC? If you can wait til tomorrow I can craft it for you.
---
I lost an extra jetpack mod I had in My stash. No I didn't scrap it. Was in My stash and when I logged in the next morning was gone when I went to get it out of my stash. 
---
This is legit very impressive... What level are you to have such a build budget?

I have a photo of me, scorched earth event, level 15, with 3 scorchbeasts in front of me

So you do know you were crouched the whole time right? 
---
As a PvE player that has played other PvP games: PvP is pointless in this game as is and needs it's own specific game mode on a separate instance. 
---
Why is PvP pointless? 
---
1. The majority fanbase wants the game PvE, they would rather work together than against fellow players. 
---
2. It costs literally nothing to repair a destroyed CAMP. All you have to do is store the broken component and then replace it or move you CAMP (auto stores as a blueprint that can be placed for free). Even if a player doesnt use this method it only costs dirt cheap mats to rebuild everything. (Steel, rubber, wood, etc.)
---
3. You arent accomplishing anything by taking claimed workshops. Most people, myself included, take the workshops for the 2 free plans (1 for claim, 1 for defend) then just build the extractors and workbenches for everyone to use. I also take them for the free fast travel node. If people are actually using the workshops to farm resources they are wasting their time, as the payout is lower than other known farming methods.
---
4. What you're describing isnt PvP, its griefing. If you have to antagonize another into PvP then it's not a mutual experience. You are making someone angry and they are retaliating.
---
5. Even without all of the above points. Killing another player nets you a bounty of usually 10 caps and a bag of random junk they happen to be carrying. Even if they have a large bounty of 200 caps that's not really anything to get excited about. Especially since the dupers have ran up all the prices.
---
Honestly? How is such a statement honest? Many are duped, but it's plain BS to say they all are when those of us who have farmed WS mindlessly to Bing Crosby for hours know otherwise.  As I posted elsewhere I was getting and trading explosive weapons early on and linked them to my reply.
---
Most of the time I don’t even bother switching anymore. I hate the two mini games and the loot in locked whatevers just isnt worth it, plus half the time you unlock something, some has already been there and the container is empty, but locked.
---
I'm not sure if the crossbow would work. Its technically not a rifle. Its energy ammo but ballistic damage so energy perks wont work except for the ammo one 
---
Yes. Anything you build will disappear when you log off, but will come back when you log on again. 
---
Well...have two conflicting answers now
---
That’s awesome man thanks. 
---
Calibrated shocks for carry weight.
---
A prequel to Fallout and a Prologue to Fallout 5/biggest content patch to an MMO ever, especially one that failed so hard at launch. I hope Bethesda makes it so, that would be a smart move, but I don't think so and if they do I will allways think they just stole the idea here :D .
---
Sounds like gatekeeping to me.. how are people going to become PvPers if the entry to it seems all kinds of messed up?  It needs to appear balanced when you try it out in order to attract more people.  It's a nice thought though...
---
Did they launch a multi million pound franchise product 6 weeks before xmas though and leave hundred of thousands of customers with a broken buggy product that they couldn't enjoy as they should?
---
It was Bethesda's choice to launch it just before Xmas as well so not sure why that would matter but hey ho if you think its acceptable in its current state then clearly it is :P
---
Lets not forget either, they've been active enough to get new content out on the Atom Store though yeah ;)
---
oh cool! thanks
---
Use the round rug 
---
I play with friends almost exclusively (its really such a different game that way). Nuke disconnects are server crashes and you can get back but most of the out if the blue disconnects and freezes aren't and you can rejoin via your teammates.
---
Between being able to get back in the same world, never losing workshops, and the blessed sharing of work cards. You really can't beat the multiplayer experience.
---
P.S. If anyone plays on Xbox (and in NA in case it matters) DM me and you can join our merry crew.
---
They laid out plan for updates/patches before the new year, and mentioned fixes coming in  2019.
---
If you were sitting there expecting an update at 12:01 on Jan 1st, that's your fucking problem
---
ooooh lawd. you should be around lvl 40ish for the golf course.
---
Its part of their financial plan. Its not going away. Bethesda needs to take the right advice. 
---
I could argue that good PvP could add more long term revenue than that PvE. Its a simpler, never ending format. 
---
They could turn it around &amp; end up with a huge PvP crowd. ESO did it. I *want* FO76 to do it.
---
Yeah i'm on PC - in-game is also neospud
---
I would greatly appreciate it!  I should be on.
---
I run music free too. I want to be able to hear enemies and nuke codes. 
---
If you’re 28 you can spec into home defense and build a skybase out the backdoor. 
---
Home defense 1 gives you the heavy turrets which are OK, not great. 
---
2 gives you shotgun turrets - good vs mobs thatcan get past your skybase 
---
3 gives you missile turrets. Which own bones. 
---
With HD3 your base melts all ghouls. Tagging them before your turret kills them can be a problem so I sometimes move my turret off center so it can’t shoot down the main hall. 
---
My power fists do ~360 damage when fully repaired. Could be perks/ mutations 
---
Every downvote from a fanboi is like a cool refreshing Nuka Cola though!
---
Maybe there's a way to dupe them...
---
Wasteland Justice
---
Oh, that’s great! Hope you got to take as much of your gear as possible.
---
Use to be to glitch to the end using power armor, may have been fixed
---
Lure 'em in with kindness and blow them up with explosives. I like it.
---
This explains why when I die get to see a map and select where I want to appear instead of just dying.
---
Also, has anyone ever seen their own body, dead?
---
Are there any mods that reduce rads as much as a hazmat suit? 
---
Store the bench that fixes it for me
---
That "Excavator Suit - Final Steps" has been annoying the shit out of me since I got it. Happy to see it's not only in my stash that it's decided to sit on top of everything else.
---
Nice CAMP btw 
---
Sure ill drop it on you while you are overencumbered and cant fast travel :)
---
Bethesda could be the Sigerians and we may be Rick, which would be awesome, or this may be Westworld, or none of the above, but I didn’t make this post to give Bethesda credit.  
---
I enjoy the game, hate many of the plethora of bugs and price gouging of the atomic shop.  I am a lifelong Bethesda fan, Skyrim fab, fallout fan, and I do not like the current direction of the company.  
---
I made this post because I kept stumbling on recurring mysterious jigsaw pieces and I have a tendency to become obsessed with mysteries.
---
Threads like this make me realize how disgusting the grind in destiny is and how sad it is that were okay with it lol. 
---
I can kill the toughest enemy in that game 30 times a day and not get a thing 
---
Ok thanks I would look at my perk cards.
---
Problem. No idea how to do any of that skybase stuff.
---
I find glue everywhere. That will be your main source of adhesive. 
---
You could equip Class freak whenever you craft, int isn't needed for combat except higher xp
---
I didn't say it was acceptable. I'm saying regardless of what the companies corporate and marketing decisions are, employees are legally and morally entitled to time with their families during holidays. And atom shop updates are already coded into the game and are on timers for release, that's why anyone data mining can see them. 
---
Lol true, but to be fair there was probably 2 of them on the floor near the container.
---
I'm going to have to agree to disagree. There's plenty of content, I know the game does have some issues but at least it's not a carbon copy of the last game. (I'm looking at you call of duty) on the note of it having issues alot of games have issues and have had issues on release here lately, you can look at everything from nms to monster hunter. Even Cod had issues and has issues with every release. I'm not going to try and argue my point and don't get me wrong I see where you are coming from. I just think there's alot to the game that people don't pay attention to. 
---
I like it the way it is. Rewards patience and foresight of switching back when combat is a possibility. 
---
I think the Gulpers give you adhesive. There's always some in the swamp by Thunder Mountain
---
I found that one last night!! I laughed waaay to much at such a simple gag but they executed it perfectly. 
---
Your own camp!
---
Tato + Mutfruit + Corn = Vegetable Starch, which scraps to 5 adhesive.
---
I used to find random glue here and there but really, i can't keep up with just that
---
You want me to mod it for you?
---
We didn't use any glitches, just a fair and square nuke run. 
---
Everywhere. Wonderglue and military duck tape pack are everywhere. In the ammo factory you have like 4 packs of duck tape for exemple.
---
He also says he abandoned it due to running out of fusion cores, when you examine it, it has a full fusion cores in it.
---
Love ya, gonna try
---
Same for 4, I have it as the centrepiece in my Sanctuary Hills settlement and I'm very cautious not to accidentally press "E" while looking at it.
---
Did you sell it? 
---
The way these fast weapons work (possible bug, but who knows) is their damage scales to how repaired (sharp) they are. 
---
Lvl 40 does 4 damage. 
---
Lvl 40 + extended blade mod does 9 damage.
---
Lvl 40 + ext blade + 200% over repaired does 37.
---
Lvl 40+ ext blade + 200% + all 3 max gladiator does 79. 
---
As you use it, the durability (and thus damage) will drop off. It wont last forever, but you should be able to get some decent uses out of it for a bit. But you can clear an entire hoard of enemies in a few seconds with a freshly sharpened one.
---
You do make some good points. I still do have some problems with your explanation. When you step out of the vault for the first time, you aren't greeted with utter destruction. You see a rather lovely view with a couple of easy robots from the Chinese, understandable given the circumstances I'd say. It's not until a while into the game where you realise how bad things have gotten. And again, the "best and brightest" comes to bite the idea in the arse. Surely they would realise, with all the danger out there, that sticking together is the best option. And with all the horrifying things that are happening, surely they'd want something familier, like the group of people they spent 25 years with.
---
I'm not trying to tear into 76 (lord knows it really doesn't need another critic). I love the idea of a Fallout MMO type thing, which is why I wish Bethesda had been more imaginative with the start of the game. Do you know what explains there being very few, isolated people in West Virginia? If all of them arrived there at different times from different backgrounds. You don't need any excuses for why they're isolated and hostile to eachother (although barely). The story of the overseer from Vault 76 could still be included. Maybe early in the game you stumble across an opened Vault 76 and a dropped C.A.M.P. From this point the game would basically play out the same, but, for me, it would make a lot more sense and leave more room for roleplaying.
---
P.S. I think the lack of hostility is mainly down to the anti-griefing mechanics introduced by Bethesda. You can still shoot eachother shortly after leaving, and that would be long enough for the irrational response to kick in, but as I said earlier I think the exact opposite would happen. People would stick together.
---
Currently setting up my camp there now along with my pet, Brutus. He likes visitors, and is partial to a fresh meat diet
---
http://imgur.com/JquRCWV
---
&gt;I just think there's alot to the game that people don't pay attention to
---
Such as?
---
The easiest route to fixing this would seem to be for Bethesda to add some bonuses to the Hacker and Lockpick perks that benefit you all of the time, so at least you don't feel so bad about leaving them equipped. Much like they do with Gunsmith. So what could those benefits be?
---
Hacker: Bonus damage to robots and turrets?
---
Lockpick: Faster reload speed for ranged weapons, because of your nimble fingers?
---
Or you could give both a directional ability, like the Perks that point you toward Bobbleheads and Magazines. These would help you to find Terminals and Locked objects. Not incredibly useful but at least it's something.
---
grow corn, mutfruit and tatos at your camp as well as a purified water extractor - these can be cooked into vegetable starch in the utility menu of the cooking pot ect which scraps into two adhesive each
---
Anglers are the best source for adhesive 
---
I’ll probably be on with my group tomorrow.
---
Feel free to add me - HeadFirstPaulo
---
We’re a chilled group and we play often. If you see me online just come and join me or pm me and I’ll send you a discord invite.
---
Haha definitely, they always troll you like that!
---
as far as I know, no.
---
But if you want to deal with rads Then I would party up, and have someone share (or share it yourself) the rad sponge perk.
---
As long as you are in power armor or a hazmat suit, and stick close together rads are not an issue at all with that perk being shared.
---
My mate does it in 9+ minutes
---
My character fell into a polar bear cage at the age of ten. Between the fall and a swipe to the face that left some wicked scars, I also lost my sense of hearing. I enjoy playing a rotating selection if songs in my head, or occasionally compose my own personal score in the background silence of my deaf existence. I also imagine gun shots and other sound effects vividly, but can't read lips. I can't hear human voices. 
---
I read a lot, to make up for it. I've always covered up my scars with dirt. I always hated washing my face or looking in a mirror. My folks and I came into the vault a year after my accident. I was the quiet, moody, antisocial kid who was always reading whatever I could find. Grocery lists, terminals (when no one was looking), that one Grognak comic I was allowed to bring in (over three thousand times the first ten years. Then I stopped counting). 
---
Since leaving the vault I've started to really come into my own. I snuck off the first night out while my parents slept (they insisted we stick together as a family, I was ready to grow apart). Every once in awhile I'll see another vault dweller. I might wave. I might help them fend off ghouls. I might run away. It depends on my mood. I feel as if this world was made for me and I'm thrilled to have it mostly to myself. My name is Grimes. My destiny is my own.
---
Build a foundation (single foundation) build some stairs up from it to some higher floor platforms which house turrets. 
---
It’s basically nothing but stairs and worthless platforms. 
---
T + M + C AND purified water.
---
Thank you! 😊
---
I don't know why I'm compelled to even bother with it. 90% of the safes I unlock are empty. I assume it's because someone else has gotten there before me, though I don't understand why it wouldn't be unlocked already. 
---
I (lvl 30 at the time) joined a server inside a level 85s owned munitions factory. The machine was full of 5.56 and unlocked. Took it all and he was walking back as I was walking out and as I passed him just said "Thanks for the ammo" and fast traveled to my base.
---
Found it last night at the “Scenic site” south east of the P&amp;G train station. 
---
I'm pretty sure 10 ish minutes is the standard
---
I’m going to need more stimpaks and I’m probably just going to wait awhile before I do it. 
---
Emergency Protocol, hard as hell to kill. Abuse adrenal mutation, nerd rage, bloody with it and obliterate.
---
Any time in 2019?
---
And are these fixes for the fixes they've patched out already or do they go to the back of the list? I guess people that bought the edition with the canvas bag and nuka cola rum should just be happy they get what they paid for in 6 - 8 weeks as well hey?
---
My problem is expecting a game I paid for to be a little less buggy than what this currently is, and expecting Bethesda to actually care about there Image and customers....but yeah you know the game is perfectly fine the way it is and every one should just be grateful they said they would fix it some time in 2019 yeah :/
---
One of the coolest quests in the game. You get teased on this suit early on, depending on if you found a place with notes talking about it. Then you find it and the plans, and then build yourself your own new power armor. 
---
...which I never wear. T60 for everyday! Those cheap repairs are the best.
---
I love right next to this. Eastern Savage Divide near the mooshiner's still right?
---
If you miss, you die...
---
Yes my psn is Capt-Of-Wolves
---
Just saying. Most Fallout speed runs evolve clipping through walls ect.
---
I get the one with the 4 mannequins facing off in a square: a clothed male and a naked female on one side, a clothed female and a naked male on the other side. 
---
I don't know why there is a need for each rank to be their own card. Why can't we just rank them up like the other perks? It would have the same perk slot cost and we wouldn't need to remove multiple cards when moving things around. 
---
Do i need any plans for that?
---
Is there a map of random encounters anywhere? Google result netted nothing. 
---
I didn't spend much time there but the mire is beautiful 
---
Congrats.  Been doing the same without any luck!  Still trying even!
---
I also have a furious and mutant slayers the dragon
---
Imagine being such a weird, lonely shill that you threaten people over video games on reddit.   
---
Hang yourself. 
---
You monster
---
I'm assuming that would still qualify haha yeah I've seen those or maxing speech before you leave the starting area or something. 
---
Just be careful not to scrap the wrong 
---
Wonder what happens if you stand on top of it as it’s launching
---
One me to clap or what?
---
Same. Made a recording, the other day.

---
You are very welcome!
---
I didn't think so, alot of videos I watched were 15+ and for low levels I know it takes a bit longer. 
---
Yup people like us, and I'm sure if they bought a product they expect it to work as well and when it doesn't they would question why expecting some form of communication from Bethesda that actually has some substance isn't unreasonable tbh.
---
It doesn’t let me send it cause of your settings lol mine is b_nano69
---
You can use a switch for this?
---
That one was really cool.
---
Holy crap that’s cute, don’t think I’ve seen one do that before
---
It's not the dupe items themselves that are the problem for sever stability, beyond hoarding them individually.  If they stack, it's not an issue, it would be the same resource drain.  It's only individual items, like every new item that didn't stack, that would be an additional drain on the resource.  These items instead flood the market and mess with the economy.  That's where they do the most damage.
---
It is the method itself, that is causing the biggest problem.  They literally spam craft until the game stops  responding and wait for it to crash.  Meanwhile, the average player just sees "Server Not Responding.  Controls have been disabled temporarily." over and over.  Which LITERALLY stops you from playing, in addition to excessive stutter and latency.
---
This method is literally DDoSing the server to crash the client and initiate the character save data rollback from cached server data.
---
I personally hope they all eat a ban but in terms of removing duped items from the market?  Yah, I don't think Bethesda is going to have the means to know which items are duped and in essence, remove them.
---
To solve it?  I think a crafting slider for amount would go a long way in stopping it that or some other method so you can not spam craft anymore, which would not be ideal for most end users.  That or they are going to have to just change how their cached data is applied in a crafting scenario, as much as that will hurt the average player.  Other than that?  I have no way to think about how to solve the issue that isn't going to be horridly annoying for the non duper end users.
---
Let me ask you this, what level were you when you decided you were done and how much of the game did you finish? 
---
What if we're the ones responsible for launching the first nukes in the real world
---
I was hoping more of a fight with some mechanics, for example, taking out its wings to prevent it from flying and shooting specific spots to reveal weaknesses to increase damage.
---
&gt;missive log
---
Was it anything to write home about?
---
Fucking cry more your whiny little bitch
---
Working on it, up until about level 35, I just kind of wandered around until the right side of my screen was a mess of words
---
There is a .308 receiver... is it that different from FO4?
---
Yeah I saw the two and knew I couldn't pass it up. I hope to hear your tale soon.
---
Oh, well in that case having someone blow it up probably wouldn't help.  "Destroyed" items still exist, and in build mode they show up as transparent versions of themselves that you can repair.  So they'd probably still be in the way.  :|
---
Rocking 345 weight limit and I'm not normally over 200 so that would be a crazy amount of stuff to take lol
---
I guess. Me and my friends just repair all the broken circuit boards and it takes about 10 minutes every time
---
Not gatekeeping. Spreading awareness. People dont realize they are doing this. Helping PvEers have some empathy for the Pvp community. 
---
Please join us PvPing. Walk a mile in our shoes. Join the club. All good and love killing eachother pvp.
---
Asking someone not to pollute data by contributing something they have no experience with is not gatekeeping.  Asking people to be honest with their feedback &amp; Inviting more players to PvP is not gatekeeping. 
---
I'm just saying your tone invites trolls and mockery. I dont disagree with the message, just the delivery, which can make or break a message. You can have the greatest plan in existence but if you're an absolute knob about presenting it, it will be discarded.
---
I may be alone in this.. but in-general, I find the Protectron voice comforting and relaxing.
---
I believe they are more likely to land if you don't shoot at them. I think this is intentional to make it possible for melee players to kill them. This was probably implemented in skyrim due to there being more melee weapons (since there are no firearms) and it was left in for fo76, because there are some melee players weapons here as well.
---
There is a correct wire but it seems to be random each time.
---
add me BirthdayyPartyy  
---
I'm only like lvl 80 but I'll protect your ass in a nuke zone as much as I can and share any legendaries I don't want.
---
I see what you mean now - i suppose that cannot be disproven as it stands, though for the sake of a good story i hope it remains just little 'what-if' easter eggs and doesnt become a big  part of the game
---
Do that quest line. You get a strong item from it. Then destory they're shit back but in a big way
---
Take your own advice you fucking nobody
---
Correct
---
My tale was going to you selling me your extra long coat!  ;)
---
82, I've explored every location thoroughly, read all the logs, did some grinding afterwards for weapon mods which ended up being useless (Ultracite Laser just tickles enemies, Plasma guns are totally broken), built myself a decent looking CAMP and nuked the Prime Fissure.
---
Why's it seem like most of the whiny cunts are from Europe? 
---
I was wondering why I couldn't get the mutations lower then 3500 even though I had my Charisma at 30.
---
hmm whiny little bitch because i upset some white bethesda fans that seem to get hurt in the butt when someone expects better from Bethesda.
---
/pathead
---
I wasn't aware of that 
---
I assume without decrypting code by yourself ? :/
---
Where smoke is...giant middle strikes. Pretty easy hehe
---
Oh.
---
Yea. I met .BEAN once soon after I started. I had just reached lvl 17, gotten my hazmat suit and was experiencing my first nuke zone in whitesprings.
---
I'd run around the high lvl PA users, shouting out to them or luring the ghouls to them to kill(since I moved faster and didnt do worth while damage, why not make myself useful?).
---
Met BEAN at some point at lvl 24, ended up teaming up and seeing their camp. Accidentally hit their fence when killing a brahmin which upset their turrets. Fun times lol
---
Close the Doors on them.
---
I saw a guy with his base right on the back door of the Golf Club, i closed the Door with all the Ghouls and me inside and the weakling with his turrets outside have nothing,,, come down and fight weakling!!! 
---
It’s possible they may go that route, but if they do, I would hope they make it clear, in-game, that this is no simulation.  
---
Until that point, since evidence has been injected into the story, not merely as an Easter egg, but at multiple locations through multiple types of supporting evidence, I am going to follow it and document as much as I can, because from my perspective, it’s the real story underlying the narrative. 
---
Heh mine was fine except for like the right leg.  I was like, "What the hell happened here?"
---
Big bad wolf for me. Not sure if it was coincidence or intentional since we had just killed off a pack of wolves. Had we found her from the opposite direction I think the wolves would have aggroed while we listened to her story. 
---
Yeah but it's broken and now i'm not allowed to voice my opinion about what things I feel are broken about it because i'm not l33t enough.  Gatekeeping.  Like I said, a separate PvP sub is a nice thought.  I just don't think you're going to get a solid PvP base going until some issues that i'm not allowed to talk about are addressed.
---
Also, how are plans usually gained?  Specific events, beasts, or locations?
---
When this was first a thing I swear I spawned that thing like 5 times, but didn't realize it was APPAREL and not a plan... I kept scrolling to the plans and seeing those damn clocks lol
---
Makes me wonder how many coats I could have bought
---
Yeah I posted this before I knew people were selling serums for 500.
---
It happened to me too,  but seems it was a bunch of selfish troll. Because after that accident,  they followed me non stop. They attacked my camp and tried to to steal my workshops in order to be able to kill me despite i was on pacific mode already.
---
They evend send me a message tellibg me to leave the world or i would still be harassed
---
How many times has it been?
---
Merci, but I am not English or French either I'm Spanish, but English people for some weird reason (not all of course) has some hard feelings for Spanish people, so I prefer to change "gracias" to "merci" (and of course I like how it sounds)  
---
Cheers mate
---
Yeah I posted this before I knew people were selling serums for 500/1k.
---
Maybe its just your pre conceptions and assumptions....typical traits of fanboi's tbh :/
---
I'm a random boy vendor selling random boy stuff in a random boy world
---
What he says
---
Got you, I was confuse, ty for clarifying
---
wait till you die somehow and you have a bunch of junk you have been farming for a couple of hours just to get disconnected right before you get to your corpse.  Happens to me once a week.
---
I won’t be online until way late tonight, once I am I’ll look for you and meet up then. 
---
So place a power switch and link them up
---
No but we did grab the codes ahead of time, I'm not even sure how to go about decrypting it ourselves. To anyone that can decrypt the codes quickly I think it wouldn't be a problem but I feel like most people would struggle doing it without ought the help of nukacrypt. 
---
100% yes
---
Alright alright alright.
---
- Also The Drifter
---
According to the prima guide its Charlie, not Bravo 
---
We're gonna need a bigger porta potty.
---
On top of the above 
---
You can connect alll your switches to one terminal if you want them on/off at different times
---
Once all switches are attached to the terminal, you can activate all switches at the same time via the terminal
---
Why did this get so many upvotes?
---
I'm always just a wanderer.
---
I think the idea is to have a team and share those in the moment.  I vote no:
---
They said next update in 2019...
---
We're 4 days in... Settle the fuck down, loser 
---
Yah I have never gotten anything worthwhile from locked containers and safes. Nothing special anyway. Never plans. Which is pretty disappointing since I was hoping for unique content and reward for those of us that wanted to be more "utility build" oriented. Seems like with persuasion and charisma dialogue abilities being gone, and the picklock and hacking skills offering next to no extra content, reward, and stuff, that there's less things to build out for than just flat combat.
---
Literally undrinkable.
---
Oh, okay! I saw someone doing that before, just didnt know you could actually build right there
---
Nope, it now gives 0 junk of any kind.
---
I think they're both torso mods so no
---
I was thinking of placing my C.A.M.P. close to the golf course, but not too close.
---
Far enough to where I would have to "lead" them out of Whitesprings and into my camp area.
---
As long as I was far enough away to not auto target anything and, essentially, had to be present and lead them there......is that being an asshole also?
---
The one with the body is probably the guy in civil war attire, carrying a black powder pistol or rifle, some ammo for it and an ad for Philippi
---
The mire, during the day. Fuck that place at night.

And you can double down on this by using green thumb when picking the plants for double bounty, as well as using super duper to get a chance at those sweet double crafts.
---
Isn't this bugged out at the moment anyway's?
---
Had all the holo's for quite a while now and every time i log in it's still there in my quest log :/
---
Great tip, thx all.
---
They're the lights that you don't hook wires to does that also work?
---
Wish we could break perk cards down into something. Even just something small, like 10 caps, is better than having to sift through my four versions of Iron Stomach.
---
I too have 3, but my dumbass should have 4. I managed to get one out of a port a diner near Welch, but I FORGOT TO RETRIEVE IT.
---
Coke as in Cocaine not coca cola. They are major drug users. 
---
Slowly with uncomfortable levels of eye contact.
---
Nope, maybe just more cunts across the pond
---
Yeah, link broken, but great tips.
---
I think so. But I found them so long ago I can't remember where. Maybe by following the main quest.
---
I got 5 points in endurance,    
---
1 radicool.     
---
1 ghoulish.      
---
1 good doggy.      
---
1 life giver (2 pts)
---
Radicool is by far the best bang for your buck, only 1 level, and its great for melee builds bc you can get up to 5 str (I think around 40% irradiated). 
---
With +5 str, that also gives you +25 carry weight.
---
I like good doggy bc: 1. Canned dog food doesnt spoil. 2 I got tired of making food, 3. Having CDF as my only food source (lol) eliminates the need to micromanage inventory. It got to be a drag having to search through the pipboy aid menu every 30 minutes to eat something and/or reassigning a food item to the favorite wheel after I ran out of whatever food item I was using.
---
Yeah I picked it up earlier it had t51 armor, do you need plans for raider armor, I’m level 12
---
Lol truth be told I was so excited I didn't even look at the plans. I could probably trade those clock plans for a mint. 
---
The worst quest in the game IMHO. 
---
Hitting the power switch deactivates the power to anything connected. If the connected conduits are what's allowing your lights to be on, and the deactivate, the lights have no power.
---
So have you followed most of the random non quest stories? That's a big part of fallout, the random encounters are cool as well and I've yet to have most happen to me and I'm lvl 105, did you know you can find an unexploded nuclear bomb? Have you found gotten the random PA with notes attached to them? Not being smug I'm genuinely asking. 
---
I shoot dead scorched in the head with my pump shotty and the head explodes. 
---
nah we just higher standards than most 
---
Yea occasionally I think it’s in their breathers 
---
Nope you are going to have to scavenge a pen and a battered clipboard and get writing like everyone else. 
---
No in game text method and those unable to audibly communicate to you may need to say more than a gesture can indicate. Thus a message via xbox messaging is the only means. 
---
Basically you're being rude to every single handicap person playing this game. Because you're worried about immersion. What about those who want exactly the same thing, but can't? 
---
Those will be coming (or something similar).
---
This is happening on my Xbox as well. I haven't had any issues with other games either. As if the constant disconnection from server wasn't enough, I feel as though the loud ERRRRRR just puts salt on my wound when I'm either in battle or trying to sort out my inventory at my camp.
---
There's a lot of back and forth on the duping debate. Generally speaking, I am sympathetic to a lot of your arguments. 
---
But don't bother trying to tell people how important or good "their" stuff is. "your TS 50cal isn't even important" is incredibly arrogant and makes you way less persuasive or credible. 
---
Oh yeah, they get pretty gigantic with Crohn's disease
---
😬
---
No, x01 has the highest rad resistance and if you throw some rad x on it's not too bad.
---
Sure, it will be discarded just because you don't like my "tone" I am not English I clarify that in the post, maybe the way I try to express myself is not the "correct", you should have a little bit more open mind and realise I do not ask you to change the way you play, just be a little bit consider to those new people who try to enjoy the game, after you read my post you have the entire power to decide if you are gonna agree with me or not, and it is totally fine, I couldn't care less, this is a reminder that people can be nice and can be dicks, and we all know for sure no one like dicks.  
---
you or whoever can troll me or mock me I won't give any importance to those things.
---
thats not a TSE so your comment is invalid. Explosive weapons are like candy at your local drug store. TSE dont show up after the patch therefore when everyone you see has listed weapons and the only weapons you see are the aforementioned ones. Trust me all the TSE are duped.
---
Roof of West Tek. :)
---
That was both me!
---
Kill Anglers they always drop some ...
---
Will do
---
The reason people keep Starched Genes enabled all the time is that it also prevents you from getting mutations that are counterproductive to your build (e.g. egghead for a melee build).
---
Maybe it's like those parts of the US where they say "coke" for any type of soda, not just a Coca-Cola? 🤷
---
Some people also use "coke" to refer to any cola drink specifically (Coca Cola, Pepsi, RC Cola - not sure if stuff like Dr Pepper goes in here but perhaps?)
---
Thankfully, I have the [best mod ever](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/174), so I'd be on to you really quick.
---
Go play 4 then?
---
Oh yeah. The PvP aspect is pretty obviously tacked on. Whether thats chasing the battle royale trend or just a random Todd Howard fixation, the majority of the development doesn't seem to have been overly concerned with it. (Hell, watch the hour long NoClip documentary, and Todd's interjections are the only time anyone even mentions it).
---
So the fact that while a bleak outlook on the setting supports it, most of the fine details are kind of dodgy kind of its in with that. The writing mirrors the mechanics, which is kind of vague and half-baked, and lacking any actual reason to engage with it.
---
As splitting up into teams of 1-4, beyond the actual technical limitations of the sphagetti code (where stuff doesn't complete as a group and so on). Its kind of down to the players. Nothing really stops the entire server operating as a unit. I've actually done two teams of 4 in tandem with buddies (on PS4, so our voice chat party caps at 8). Its certainly effective, and only kind of disincentivized by the fact that someone in your team has to damage an enemy pre-death or it won't have any loot for you.
---
Maybe just all CAMP/Non-Combat/Non-Status-Effect perks should "unlock" as soon as you get the card (either from level up and picking it or getting from a pack) and never have to be equipped...
---
Haha really though..
---
It was basically 
---
"oh he spawned!!! “
---
Scroll scroll scroll
---
" those goddamn clocks again!? "
---
It was, except the tuxedo pack
---
Unless you're deaf or mute and the only means to communicate is through text. No one game text method. What's the work around here? Oh... right. 
---
Zealous666 is correct make cheap arms and scrap for a random mod for that armour set.
---
I was apart of the beta and launch of ESO even got to xfer my pc lads over to PS4 when they offered it before switching the consoles on.
---
It was abit rough but nothing compared to 76 launch. 76 has to succeed atleast until the next Fallout game.
---
I have my eye on Anthem but gonna wait and see because its EA and after MEA i swore i never jump into their bed again without waiting a few months.
---
No problem on that and i think why my thread did so well. Was mainly because of how little people knew about their effect on everything. Like i said a game that is ONLINE only cannot have these issues not sorted fast.
---
[Yo, no photos here please](https://imgur.com/q1iSOxn)

[Maybe take a look behind you?](https://imgur.com/rpq4CwF)
---
In a game that cannot be paused because of multiplayer I absolutely hate how often I have to switch perk cards for simple shit and how often I go into battle having forgotten to switch back. This is the biggest headache in the game to me to be honest. 
---
Another day older and deeper in debt..
---
Never heard someone refer to cocaine as singular.
---
Had the same on Xbox about 20 mins ago
---
No, it's an easy thing to miss. Yes, I've activated it several times. But I didn't think about distance. I moved it to the floor closer to the power connection to see and yep, it turned on! It makes the fish quite visible now. The fish is blue &amp; the glass is bluish with brown tone rocks if your looking for a specific color palette. Thanks for the distance suggestion!
---
LoL
---
You get it. Im just asking people to be honest. You already are. 
---
This post isnt intended to educate ppl like you. Being l33t has nothing to do with it. Im trying to help. 
---
Its more for the posters "Someone higher level stole my public workshop once, Triple bounties and add a karma system so i know people are baddies and they should be nerfed for bad behavior because pvping in a pvp zone is bad behavior" 
---
If your build doesn't focus on maximizing some particular type of damage that a mutation would help out with, that's all good.  If though you focus on melee, not so much on ranged, you can rest assured those few points will be well spent.  You might not even need class freak if you don't care about the side affect of something like twisted muscles.
---
I'm plagued all the time by thoughts of missing a few points of accuracy for twisted muscles so i have the ability to swap to melee and hit decently hard even though i focus on ranged weapons.  I don't know if it's too extreme of a tradeoff or what it is about it.
---
In terms of tradeoffs when building a character, i can't think of anything that left me so conflicted as mutations have in recent memory.  I think maybe it's not such a great design.  Maybe they should have implemented it like a research tree where you could go down branches and had like 3-5 tiers and one mutation chosen in each tier.  And just left the side effects out of it.
---
I'm on Xbox, GT is Kaise7en. I'm down for about anything! 
---
Most the salty people are too busy complaining about the game to play it, win win
---
Does luck make a difference in the rewards?
---
Great! Glad you got it working.
---
There is for the pipe revolver? I thought I had unlocked everything! 
---
This is starting to remind me of the "contractors on the Death Star" argument from Clerks
---
those guys know what they're doing
---
I don't have the switch plans yet, but you could build a switch on a wall, then hook the generator directly to the switch. If the switch is on, the lights that go by "radial power" (no wires directly to them) should turn on, and they should turn off when you flick the switch again.
---
Give them a pipe rifle that is 20 pounds each and worth exactly 201 caps so you can never sell it
---
Don't suppose you have a link to such a recording do you?
---
I appreciate the offer. I'm level 180, I'm fine, thanks. 
---
You can also build a hut with an open sliding door and have a pressure plate/laser tripwire on the inside of the doorway to trigger the door itself. Add in any radiation traps or whatever as you like. Have a bunch of marquee arrows and shit enticing people to enter.
---
Source: did similar things to a workshop to keep people from capping it. Walled it in with concrete defense walls, put BOTH tripwires and pressure plates down wired up to radiation emitters and, instead of a sliding door, a swing blade trap to slap them into the corral. Killed a couple people who ignored the "keep out" signs. Potted plants do wonders to hid tripwires and plates.
---
After getting the perk for extended duration, I gave 25 of mine to a low level player who was level 17 I think. He was super grateful, but the poor sap could not carry them all and had to slow walk back to his camp! Not sure if I helped him or made his walking 45 mintues hell haha. 
---
Lol maybe cause it's a song from are world 
---
And I'm here with like 20 stimpaks
---
The liberty prime event is definitely not a lore friendly event in the slightess
---
Pc
---
cloth is so common it's not even funny though, cigaretes also provide cloth, as do cigars
---
I've found vendors to be the supreme way of farming legendaries, especially the whitespring bunker/watoga vendors.
---
I picked it up at silo Alpha
---
I have this thing where I dress up in overalls and a sack hood and just walk walk at people until they notice me, and once they do I take out my chainsaw and continue walking at them to see their reactions. Usually I just get ignored or they run away. One guy stabbed me. Another played along and not only ran away, but was using his mic and telling me not to cut him up into tiny little pieces. 
---
But there was one guy, a level 3 in the Vault-Tec ag center. He came up to me, put his gun away....and started asking me questions. About how the CAMPs work. How quickly his weapons will degrade and how much it’ll be to repair them. I felt a connection to this guy. Just got the game as a late Christmas gift or something like that. So, I put the chainsaw away and put on my normal clothes, and spend a long time answering everything he had. Somebody launched a nuke, and he thought he should be worrying about that. I checked the map and saw that it was Whitesprings, so I told him that he’s gonna be perfectly safe, nothing to worry about. 
---
And then it happened. I got a disconnect. Right when I was going to send him a friend request. I was pissed at the game for tearing me away from him. And heartbroken that this new soul was instantly left alone in the Wasteland, maybe even thinking that I abandoned him without any reason. Luckily, I was recording my game, originally to get the reactions of people being chased by a psycho, so I was able to send him a request since I couldn’t remember what his name name was, meaning the recent tab in the social menu wouldn’t do me any good. But...haven’t seen him since. Him or his clean summer shorts....
---
Anyway, I’m on the PC. I hope you enjoyed reading about me making a friend and losing him all within a the course of a few minutes, OP. 
---
Actually it does not boost gun accuracy, when I put on the sight the accuracy number says 19 unless it is a bug as well.
---
&gt;If it's a max level TSE shotgun, you honestly don't even need shotgun perks and it'll still oneshot pretty much every non-legendary non-scorchbeast enemy in the game
---
excellent design all around
---
So here's a question. Can you put the turrets behind a rolling garage door so that people can turn them on/off by blocking line of sight
---
How is he displaying 4 PA suits?  They don't automatically go back into his inventory?
---
You can jump up on top of stuff and snipe it.. it's good for sniper.  Also if there's stuff up on a roof or somewhere up high you can jump up and melee it.  But you can also do that with a jetpack.
---
My current chest piece is raider deep pocket and adds 15 pounds, I don’t think the piece is that much? Also I have the card that makes armor lighter, don’t remember what it is called
---
Crashed me out so hard my router rebooted.
---
Jk - was a brownout that got me.
---
I feel very similarly to you. It could be my perfect/favorite game, I think, but many features/mechanics that are very important are not working well. I didn't really notice it as much until I was 50+ hours in to the game. Right now I am taking a break, hoping that Bethesda addresses some of the deficiencies in the coming weeks/months.
---
Thanks for letting me ChcukB ;)
---
That’s fucking incredible knowledge lol. Gonna start destroying duper’s camps 
---
He was in power armor
---
How did you get another players turret to attack the deathclaws? They normally just sit still if not agro to the owner or teammates or structure.
---
I got the plan from the traveling merchant - Graham
---
Haha OK... 
---
Sure thing were should I begin lol
---
I'm gifting my steam copies
---
Whoever downvoted this good on you? Its not about the karma or anything I'm just wondering why was my question something you just felt was not appropriate to ask in this sub?? 
---
It's random each time, the higher luck you have the higher your chance is 
---
Also, Zenimax owns two different studios who created franchises (not spoiling which ones) based on the “it’s a simulation” premise, and that was just in the past five years. One of those studios even helped work on FO76 according to Todd Howard.
---
I don’t know if that makes it more or less likely that they’ll actually follow through with the simulation idea in 76, but it’s definitely the kind of reveal you’d want to save for a much later date in an online game. I’m betting they’ll go through with it eventually, though.
---
I have a 2 shot explosive pie. 
---
Someone didn't take his nap.
---
I gave a friend my orbital strike to do just this... Some little lv28-or-so asshat had a building surrounded in turrets trying to farm behind the golf club.
---
It has a long way to go. There is no incentive other than to waste someone else's time and the "slap" system is bs. 
---
Always blue
---
If you take rads you're going to get more mutations eventually.  So that's great if you want all of them but if you're seriously trying to avoid some, it can be very problematic.  If you like absolutely don't want empath, you can try to get rid of it but loose on you want instead.
---
This is wholesome. I love this community.
---
Explosive needs balancing big time.
---
Energy weapon durability needs a massive buff too.
---
Durability calculating needs to change as well to be about time fired not just the number of hits.
---
Hey this might be the best option short of having Bethesda do it. Thank you!
---
Do you have a map by chance?
---
PC is much worse now too. I used to have no issues at all with CTDs and disconnects, but over the past couple of weeks things have gotten notably worse. The past couple of days specifically have been nuts. Multiple CTDs and disconnects every play session.
---
Fun fact: that power armor frame weighs 0 until you place it down for the first time.
---
Anyone wanna shoot for tonight or the weekend?
---
I agree with that, if you're playing with a group and you become wanted out shouldn't be that easy.  Plus I think your whole group should be wanted together.
---
Yes! Nobody will ever findy camp.  It's tucked away in some cliffs 
---
Or you can just sell it to him cause why not ? Its not fun server hopping and how rng is in this game sucks.
---
Anyways , nice coat
---
Yeah like a strong healthy non-mutated individual might ... not have all the side effects of mutations.  So maybe they need to have worse side effects?  Remove class freak from the game and it'd probably balance out a little better =P
---
I'm in the 18 range like you on PS4 I'll add you a bit later !  Canadian here, my progress will be slower ( preordered but smelling the roses) but a friendly face is a friendly face :)
---
For your sake, I pray you never play a Valve game if even two updates in less than two months isn’t enough. 
---
I can confirm that the Jetpack is a Torso Modification but I am not sure about Tesla Coils. If Tesla Coils is a Torso Modification, you can not have both. Sorry 😐, but if you have another Power Armor Chest Piece you might be able to mod that to have one of the mods and the other to have the other mod, and just change the Torso in you’re appeal list for what one you wish to use.
---
Are you on PC? I'm going to do some heavy farming this weekend and I can keep my .308 for you, I'm melee so I don't really use ammo 😂
---
Can you use gunpowder and lead to craft them? I can save that too if that helps.
---
Marsupial helps, Jetpack is even better.
---
Also, I usually perk for melee, so just switch to that when its close range.  It's ridiculous that even though I don't even have a two shot (I have a quad ammo explosive pump shotgun), it kills most things in one shot anyways despite perking for melee.
---
There is a golf cart and a set of golf clubs on the ground right out in the grass out back of the main door. That seems to be the closest you can get. 
---
YES! BLESS YOU! I found that thing last week and I've been trying to get over there in time for a nuke launch to see what it looks like (if it even does anything), with no luck yet. Not disappointed!
---
For all the negatives surrounding the game they really don't get enough credit for the world design.  I love exploring and finding all the random and non random things placed around. Each area of the map feels diverse and unique.  
---
I had my camp up north for awhile before realizing I'd be spending too many caps fast traveling from that location.  There was unmarked tree house swarming with fireflies, a random photo backdrop set up in the middle of nowhere, and plenty more I don't remember.  Side note - they definitely need a unique vendor in the North of the map to give people a reason to go up there.
---
To be fair here, i think it is only referred to in the singular, no one says im going to go do lines of cokes. Or im going to snort all my cocaines... but they might do all of their shopping at the wal marts....damn hillbillies...
---
Shaka, when the nukes fell. 
---
Lol *bot but that’s cool
---
For what exactly, the odd chance it'll give me plans for something I already have ? for caps I don't need and can get faster in other less involved ways ? for a few stims that can be gotten faster and in larger quantities outside events ?
---
Cost vs Reward my friend, events just don't have it unless they happen to be active where I already am.
---
in the end tho its down to what each of us prefers, you like events and I like farming Watoga / Other profitable locations, to each their own friend.
---
PvP is broken and not really worth it.  I can one shot any player with several weapons, and they can too, so there really isn't much point.
---
The thing that REALLY sucks is getting duplicates for 1 rank cards. I've gotten so many hacker and lockpicking duplicates from packs...
---
Turned texture settings to medium fixed it for me
---
It could have been this group was farming xp or legendaries on whitesprings green before I died and respawned
---
I also wanna know do those perks affect the fatman 
---
The only way to do it is to drop them from your inventory. So he's very trusting that a high level player isn't going to swing by and jump in one. Don't have to worry about low levels, as they can't get in them.
---
Valve games = Half-Life, Portal. No need to patch single-player games often. dota, tf2, csgo - junk, not interested. 
---
As I see in the entire amount of comments, every single person find something about what I say to refute, it is ok of course, but they have that little part in themselves that ALWAYS wanna try to change from the other or try to be absolutely right, I'm not saying I am 100% correct with my statement or mocking of everyone else, I'm not trying to be correct either, I am sharing my point of view, even if people can find something they don't like in my words, its ok, it is 100% ok, you can tell me I am a dick for saying it or try to correct me, because maybe I am a little bit arrogant or so, but it is not the point, I am not trying to sound arrogant, or trying to prove I'm better than no one, I am sharing facts.  
---
That weapon he refers in the previous post it is worthless at this moment, you know it, I know it and we all know it, not because the weapon is bad or because I want to make it look bad, it is because of the context, because of the actual situation. As the author in this post I have to stick around with my words and try to understand every single point of view, this is the reason why I posted in the first way, so please understand you and all who are reading this, I am not making this post to sound superior or change the way you think, it is just a reminder of who you really want to be. I made a lot of friends in the short months this game has been running, I've been playing MMO's since more than 20 years and in this game I find out A LOT of good people, kind people, give yourself a chance to be kind to be good to be a reasonable player, or be the other idiot that one-shot everything and everyone complains about.  
---
Saludos and thanks for reading.
---
Please fix targeting hud for the power armor helmets. Only highlights about 50% of mobs at random. Two identical mobs standing next to each other = one highlighted and one not. Many times it fails to highlight hardly anything.
---
That was beautiful my dude.
---
Seconded! I want to know if you can ride the missile to glory! 
---
A way to dupe downvotes? For sure. Go to any gaming subreddit outside of this one and say you like Fallout 76. Easy dupes.
---
So, I do think at this point a lot of the hate about this game is overblown, a lot of it is just YouTubers riding the hate wave for views, which works unfortunately well in our current outrage cultute, and then people parroting what they hear from them.
---
However, I want to tell you why I personally am very upset with Bethesda and the state of this game.
---
The dawn of microtransactions started a trend of videogames being running progressively more like businesses and less like passion projects, because microtransactions are BIG money, and people want their hands on it.
---
This trend has led to a lot of questionable business practices in quality games, as well as low-effort games being pumped out with premium priced cash shops. A lot of people who don't play mobile games at all don't understand how bad this can get, and make no mistake, the bridge between platforms has been steadily decreasing, and people have steadily been more and more okay with pricey virtual items inside already pricey games.
---
Now we have Fallout 76. Look, I enjoy playing this game, but I'm gonna be real here. I don:t understand where development really went in to this game. Almost every single aspect is ripped directly from FO4, down to bugs in game systems and weapons that we're never fixed. If you told me this was just a really detailed mod for FO4 a couple guys created in their basement, I would totally believe you. There are so many basic bugs and things forgotten.
---
This game, in it's current state, after several patches, feels like a mid-beta game from about 5-10 years ago.
---
Considering seemingly how little effort went into this game, along with how much they're charging for intro atom shop prices, how expensive their half assed power armor collectors pack was, the questionable quality of the nuka dark rum bottles... Almost every aspect of this game at release screamed cash grab.
---
Now, as you say, a lot of aspects of that have gotten better. But... That only happened because of the major backlash they received.
---
Blindly supporting a game in such a state as this game released in is telling gaming companies everywhere that you're happy paying premium prices for recycled crap, and it hurts the gaming community as a whole.
---
That's (at least part of) why people get angry at people trying to downplay the negative aspects of this game.
---
Shit I thought I replied to the other guy.
---
It's better than t51 and t45 actually... Recheck the stats bud
---
Yeah I've been tempted by the armour (non-PA) paints but don't know if they apply once I mod them. Otherwise I would have been wearing the blue leather armour for most the game!
---
I think I'll keep about 4 / 5 k in reserve and treat myself with anything over that  :)
---
What was it getting mailed?
---
I had one circling around my camp. Shot it and the cargo drone down. Luckily they landed in the pond and not on my house. 
---
Just. Don't. Go. Underneath....
---
Id like to think that some of the bugs we hit in game are simply glitches in the simulation and its why Beth hasnt yet fixed them yet.
---
it would be really amusing if on launch of the expansion we get a forced reset, where we emerge from the simulation to find we have nothing and have to go out and acquire everything again.
---
would be one way to kill off all the duping, fix the duping bugs and then do a forced reset.
---
As much as i agree with the complaint it would make locking your camp/extractor/ etc from people pointless, since everyone would have lockpicking 3 anyway.
---
I did this (after) I discovered this by accident but regardless I have a full set of 51 and Ultracite sitting unused because of my hoarding ways.  Excavator having 100 and sometimes 200 extra carry weight is a godsend when doing nuke runs.  Snatch it all and sort later is my mantra.
---
I need to really have a come to Junk meeting with myself and see what I truly need and donate all else to the needy (read as drop it for those single levelers I’m helping all the time.
---
I might have around 2k? I give all mine away to so you can have them for being a nice person too, will be on in a couple hours :) 
---
That I currently do have that card for when we play. What I was thinking is a card that sacrificed some of my experience point gains or something like that. I was thinking similar to Inspiration, except you are giving the experience gains to the teammates. It could be named “Greater Good” or something like that. 
---
Sadly it doesnt do much.
---
The pressure plate pair with the doors perfect but I've notice that if ppl don't see me use it to open the door they think it's a trap
---
They do, it's us.
---
Well best of luck!
---
Funny to listen about rules and laws when you read tons of messages about crunches and so on in the game industry. Looks like the only Bethesda makes a trashy project and follow rules :))))
---
Try the fo76bazaar
---
No plans needed. Just go to a cook station and look under the bottom-most tab. It's considered a basic recipe. You'll need a plan for a water purifier or water filter though, for the purified water.
---
Super mutants decided it wouldn’t be really fun to shoot it down in my house! 
---
I saw the up side and then tried to get the cargobot but it disappeared.
---
I think the game hates me! 
---
As a lvl 98 I have given many low lvl players food, water, junk, weapons, and ammo. I usually drop 10 mil, .38, and .44, if I have enough I'll drop .308 for peeps as well. So if your a lower lvl and on PS4 and have picked up one of my drops hopefully it made your life a little easier in the wasteland. 
---
Mine was playing the pied piper tune. Hence the rats following him.
---
Can I get in on that? Looking for Healing Factor, Speed Demon and Grounded. 
---
I wonder when West Virginia converted to the metric system.  
---
I'm not asking bethesda to reduce the amount of caps per day, i'm asking that the faction based vendors dont have pooled financial resources.and that they increase the amount available per day.
---
Same. I have so much .38 ammo, oil, adhesives, etc. that I have to just throw them out, but Fallout 4 taught me all ammo and weapon-making junk is precious, and I always pick them up anyway.
---
No radio?
---
Speaking of Whitespring glitches, if you go to the vendor level, then to the vendor across the hall from the big crafting room one, there is a pillar in the back you can look around and see some sort of glowing purple texture in the corner where the Serenity Lane simulation is failing.
---
Ya no problem. I'm at work for a few more hours. Send me a dm on here so I can message you when I'm home 
---
They require the raw version, which is annoying. I have plenty of stable yellowcake and nothing to use it on besides serums.
---
Are you OK?
---
These are the opinions im talking about in my post. 
---
Im not playing for any farming, gear, caps, or greif. I actually lose caps pvp pretty often and spend an hour farming 1000 caps so i go pvp at workshops. 
---
For the most part you assuming *WHY* i pvp. You assume my goal is to bug other players.  That is wrong. What if i just want to FIGHT other players on FO76? I did buy a PVP game as advertised. Well, i go to the workshops where pvp is dedicated and kill the players. Im not greifing. Im literally playing the only PvP mechanic in the game. (Unless hunter/hunted miraculously works). The fact that PvE'rs have the arrogance to say the the only dedicated pvp zone in the game should be a safe haven for people farming / grinding is astounding. Please try to see things from the other side. 
---
Its the pve community that is in the wrong there. You guys dont see it. I was sold a pvp game. Im playing pvp at the pvp zones. 
---
Point 4 is incorrect. How can the greifer be the one losing more. If i smash a camp and die i lose 200 caps. You lose 4 rubber and 3 wood. We are just playing the game.  We are playing the game the way its designed to be played. You guys are making pretend lines and calling it greifing when we cross them.
---
Workshops are ours. 
---
Yeah because those games aren't actually buggy and unplayable.
---
Try again.
---
The best evidence for me is how you can be running along and just randomly stagger and take damage from invisible things, as if you are strapped to a simulation couch and some obnoxious kids are poking your sleeping face with a stick.
---
It really do be like that sometime
---
I’d rather lobby Bethesda to remove it from 76.
---
I haven't run into one of these yet. Maybe a new pokemon Boomratta, cripples legs haha
---
Can I just add if you are doing a group event like Whitesprings or Uranium Fever, and you are using an explosive shotgun, you are an asshole.
---
This is amazing, really love it wastelander.
---
Because F3, F4 and F76 are not RPGs 
---
The mods probably shill for bethesda
---
Nah.
---
Say you have 3 total perception, and you have green thumb, and that magazine finder perk I'm not even going to attempt to spell the name of equipped. 
---
You come across a level 1 lock.
---
Under the current system, this is easy. You still have 1 slot available, so equip lockpicking if you haven't already and open it.
---
If lockpicking was 3 star card you fully upgraded, you'd have to remove everything first just to pick the lock.
---
Sure, you'd save a few button presses for 3 star locks, but how often do you come across them?
---
Yeah that is very true. I might do the same as well.
---
I'm stuck with 1800 .38 rounds, no good gun uses them
---
Farm whitespring just like every other loser in the game
---
You need to compare the lvl 50 variants not the weakest variants. T51b has at lvl 50 the highest dr *and* er but it's rr is meh(still good enough) it even beats the dr of ultracite and the er of (lvl50) X-01 by 1 point each. Lvl 50 t60 on the other hand has pretty high rr but noticeably worse dr and er(but is cheap to repair)
---
You're a fucking monster
---
There should be ‘combat’ perks and ‘non-combat’ perks. Non combat perks should not take special slots.
---
Non combat perks would be like all the hacking/lockpicking perks, and any perk that has no benefit in combat. Dog food perk, water drink in doing more, all the repair to 200% (fix it good and the other one), weight reduction, etc.
---
However If it has a benefit in combat then it should take a slot. These include the obvious perks as well as perks like makeshift warrior, even the perk that reducing repair cost of power armor but makes it break slower. These hybrid perks are fine too.
---
But we shouldn’t have to sacrifice how efficient we are in combat because I don’t want to stop and re equip lockpicking every time I see a locked chest/hackable terminal.
---
Nope, there a number of locations where it spawns.
---
Do you like rollercoasters?
---
Oh lawd, that would be waaaay too many caps available per day.
---
Seems I have to break it to all of you, but ALL of Fallout 76 is a simulation in a computer. So OP is right, only not in the way he/she thinks.
---
Add me also, fellow dublin lady here. Mzdizzii on there :)
---
I instinctively was going to ask "WHERE?!?!?" About the TSE and I'm not even in-game. Well played.
---
Yep. Sorry about that but I suppose you'll need to look for a consensus in the comments because I'm sure I'm right but the other person is too apparently lol
---
But I maintain this: you won't unlock a chest mod by scrapping legs. You won't unlock a legs mod by scrapping arms. And I've scrapped *a lot* of armour.
---
I was only in my vault suit and not in power armor. Shit is still scary since I barely had protection
---
I get that. I think it's a bug. For example: Let's call my 2 friends with the game "Jack and Jill". Jack doesn't ever log on but Jill plays often.
---
However my friend list frequently says Jack is online and Jill is offline. But turns out Jills really online when it says Jack is.
---
I limited my original post to information contained within Fallout 76, which you would know had you read further
---
I mean, that's pretty much what Marcupial does 
---
Either their game crashed and created a strange bug, or they appear offline. 
---
More health with less AP
---
I’m always building up lower levels at the white spring, always willing to help.
---

---
Don’t want to be a downer, but I believe the invisible damage/stagger is the result of alcohol or drugs wearing off, coded differently than other fallouts 
---
Remove yourself from 76?
---
You may have too many photos saved, go to gallery and see if you have something like 30 or 40 photos saved. 
---
It usually corrects itself after a couple mins.
---
RIP your carry weight for the past 2 weeks 
---
Cheers! 
---
You could arrange that I think. You can't fast travel when enemies are nearby. I've heard that tamed creatures are hostile to random people. So simply build a cage next to the trap with a tamed creature in it. Use a window or something so creature can aggro on victim (but can't get to them) that way the victim is "in combat" while trapped.
---
Thank you, Thank you Thank You!
---
Just Respec imo
---
&gt;I think it repairs it to 200% but doesn't increase the damage.  For armor and power armor it for sure increases DR/ER (fix it good perk).  For weapons I don't think you get more damage out of them.  It's still super good to have.. effectively halving your repair cost.  Or more if you like to fix it a little early before it breaks.
---
Been trying but then I decide I want to try a certain perk and have to get the max lvl.
---
Now you just need too get rid of over 300% space stored but it's nice ^^ 
---
 Nah my inventory is messed. I can’t access anything and I don’t even have a pip boy
---
Is there a limit to how many we can take?
---
Beta silo launches from the rocks East of Grafton steel workshop. I watched one take off. Hadn't been up there to see if I could find the silo doors yet.
---
Are you sure you're talking about Playstation. And are you sure you're talking about Fallout 4?
---
I know what you're talking about is the case with Playstation 3 for New Vegas and Fallout 3. But not for Fallout 4....unless I'm crazy.
---
yeah, you can turn settlements into raider camps and take over the Commonwealth with raiders
---
I have a bad habit of mashing scrap all junk first thing when I return to a crafting station. Rip hardened masses.

Cant get in them but can still take the parts off them and then jump in the shell
---
You realize "I don't care about X so X isn't a problem" isn't a defense, right? At best it's erasure of the issue because it doesn't affect you. 
---
Hey, are those tentacle monsters already in the game?? I hope not
---
Remind me to never piss you off.  
---
\- Also The Drifter
---
There's a perk card that does exactly that isn't there? Cant remember what its called but I'm sure there is.
---
I have used nexus mods since near release, same one you mentioned and others and am not banned.
---
This is my lead extractor and scarecrow though. I don't know. It crashes every time i try though. 
---
That happened to me but I only got three copies. I better not get banned for duping lol. 
---
Yeah! How dare level 20's run around a place that has a quest that requires you to kill level 9 ghouls. Those same ghouls that are nearly impossible to spawn at a higher level. And that being one of two quests that are at Whitespring Resort.
---
Crazy how the only two Whitespring quests are aimed at lower levels, a simple collection quest and kill some low level ghouls. And these jerk level 20's have the nerve to actually attempt these quests that are aimed specifically at them, how very dare they!?
---
This. I get frustrated when i keep getting hacker and picklock. Its a waste of card and at least one or the other show up in the perk packs. 
---
No, there IS a Challenge for "Play for 76 hours". But there's another challenge, separate from that, for 7600 hours. 
---
Not sure why they didn't include a "760" hours....I guess cause "Seventy Six", not just the individual numbers....I dunno.
---
True
---
Well, that sounds like a personal issue.
---
Marsupial is a triple jump with +20 increased carry weight. The only drawback is -4 int. You would have to buff your mutation by quite a lot to compare.
---
Of course, some mutations seem to just be increased versions of other mutations.
---
I would still say you need to buff that, though. There's some OP mutations. I wanna be able to burrow underground!
---
I mean singular as "one Coke". No one has ever said "Let me do one coke off your ass cheeks."

---
ooh, nice. I didn't even know about that. 
---
I experienced this in cranberry bog. It's a random encounter Easter egg. An Eyebot is flying through tunnels (crevasse in the bog) emitting that music, with around 7 or so radrats following it exactly in perfect march. I saved it on xbox if you have access and want it shared.
---
If you have the perk manager mod, you need to disable it when you level to pick your new cards and open card packs
---
Oh ok. If you're going off the enclave prices then yeah they're expensive.
---
Same here, I always make sure to report it through PSN along with the video clip, and have taken to using increasingly sarcastic bug report titles.  I'm not sure it's related, but I did go over 2 hours today without a crash which is by far the longest in weeks.

Does exactly as requested. 
---
Hope this helps! 
---
Yeah I always thought it was odd how quickly I kept getting over encumbered right after throwing all my junk home. 
---
I just wish the mutations were physical as well
---
Wow quick reply! Thanks for the feedback, just wanted to see how everyone else is doing with mods.
---
Lol this is a perfect response. I agree. I concede to your intellectual prowess. 
---
I think what I’m about to say can help a lot of people. I’m pretty sure the negative stats from mutations and other things don’t actually take away SPECIAL points. They just effect the underlying mechanics of them.
---
For instance, if you have -2 Agility, your number of perks in Agility don’t go down, but you suffer a small hit to your stamina because that’s what the stat dictates. With -2 Strength it will make ur carry weight go down but not effect your selected perks in that stat.
---
So with -2 intelligence... well nothing really happens because Intelligence doesn’t actually effect any in-game stats as far as I know. You should still be able to keep all ur points and perks in that stat.
---
I’m not 100% sure this is how it works but I’m 90% on it. Here’s my character as an example. I have 12 points in Intelligence and all those points are filled with perks. I got Marsupial which gives -4. Well my Intelligence is still 12 and all my perks are still active. And I don’t use Class Freak at all.
---
If this was your reason for not mutating then you (and apparently a lot of other people) were afraid of nothing.
---
I spent at least 8 in game hours running that bridge. I'm glad it's rare but those weren't fun times.
---
Better With Salt, in Luck.  -30/60/90% for 1/2/3 points.  
---
Everthing i have to say is here.

I just crashed halfway through a silo run by myself. Took twenty mins then attempted it again. Blue-screened about a quarter way through this time. The crashes are a f’ing joke.
---
Not sure about cool or unique, but there's a spot north east of watoga that is a really good spot. There are two mineral pits that you can have inside your camp space. One is gold, the other is copper. You're nearby a sundew forest (cranberries and a lvl 3 safe), a random encounter spot, two different vendors, you're outside of "Scorched Earth" Nuke zone but can walk in there,  are the center of the BoS events and several Enclave events, and Watoga itself is a "safe area" once you complete Mayor for a Day.
---
I have an Explosive Junkie's I could sell. It's a 2 star
---
It's one of those things people don't pay attention too. At 0.25 units a piece, plans can add up quick. Also watch out for gunpowder, Bobby pins, and missiles. Those can all secretly eat away your carry weight 
---
Was trying to farm there yesterday and just about every other server I went to had some cunt who was doing this. Think I'm gonna start turning off pacifist when I see those camps and someone just standing on top of it crush them with daisycutter.
---
I know I'm awful I felt so bad
---
Great post.
---
The only shitty thing I'm seeing around here is your posting.
---
Also here's a fun fact. U can use binoculars in this game. I didn't know that until I noticed binoculars in my weapons inventory. It suprised me. 
---
I don't recall ever unlocking a safe and having it be empty.  Weird.  If someone has recently looted it, it's just unlocked with loot in it.  Because instanced loot.
---
Maybe if I had recently looted it and it had re-locked but my instanced loot wasn't ready to respawn yet?  Dunno, that's not something I do.
---
If you're on PC, I have a Blade of Bastet and Voice of Set I can give you.
---
Hmm.  I didn't do anything special, I don't think.  IIRC they started lighting the deathclaw up when it got close.  A deathclaw would be automatically hostile to the owner, wouldn't it?  Now I want to replicate this to be sure.
---
Nah you aren't making any sense bud.  I am showing an example of how easy it is to get RNG with the explosive trait.  There's tons of 2 shots out there, yet your conclusion with zero evidence is still stubbornly that they're all duped? You're using emotional decision making based on zero evidence to rule out smoke being from a fire.
---
Duper’s bazaar
---
Great idea I’ll just create a new chest piece thanks.
---
I have the exact same problem.
---
I have all the tapes and even knowing the challenges' page shows it as completed, the quest is still in the log.
---
Well I did double duty. I desperately needed acid and a Grafton Monster spawns on the other side of that bridge. I gathered enough acid to break down my lead. Now I need to farm more for my ultricite.
---
Scorched mothman?! Wow, havent seen that varient. Think theres a glowing varient too
---
The more you know
---
Yes, I read it all and: of course. Which is where you think you are as per "I can reach no reasonable conclusion at this point other than that we are in a simulation.". And you are correct.
---
Umm lol you can place then down without disappearing the power armor he isn't trusting anything you just place it down not drop it, it's bound to your character no one can "steal" your power armor unless you let them I guess.
---
No downside. It'd be almost impossible to buy or trade with somebody who hasn't duped at this point. You'd never be able to tell. 
---
Awesome, will do thanks!
---
What are you wearing?
---
Really? As a Canadian I actually didn't know that was still a thing.
---
Taking a workshop from someone is a way to initiate PvP, but not the only way. The events that happen at Prickett's Fort and Watoga High school are examples of the the actual PvP elements in the game. You are *competing* against another player for a reward. Not just killing them for fun and calling it PvP. I kind of get the feeling that you were expecting a battle royal or similar type mode, which may still happen. The game wasnt very well marketed to anyone and expectations were really all over the place. No one really knew what to expect 100%. So, I feel you on that.
---
When I say dedicated instance for PvP I mean that everyone in that particular server will be in a particular PvP mode. Like a free for all where you collect materials, build a base, attack other players and take what they have, etc. As much as I hate to put it this way but basically Fallout with Fortnite/PUBG elements. This would put the people that want to do raids and co-op together in one place and the people that want to faceoff against each other in another. Then they could build up PvP for the PvPers without having to compromise with the PvEers.
---
Maybe make it like an achievement. Get the card, use it as it currently works, but after you pick 100 lvl 1 locks you've "learned" basic locking and the first card no longer takes a point. Just a thought. 
---
Oh i know :)
---
What? Are these the pies out of that claw vending machine? You can actually get them? I’ve always thought they were just there to troll you.

Feel free to PM me any other questions. I've done everything possible in the game and can probably solve any dilemma you run into. Glad to help new players 
---
Nice
---
Having the ability to so easily swap cards on the fly is the real issue here. That way you can actually have a dedicated hacker, lock picker or crafter on your team. These are perks that male you “Special”. 
---
Yep! He had it! Thank you!!
---
The ranger shorts look good on my character, but I think they probably don't suit everyone. I'm hoping for a clean pair.

Sounds like Gilded Paint and no you can’t learn it from scrapping. It’s pretty rare 
---
I hope not, everyone died, that is the lore.
---
I know the code reason it happens, but visually it's hilarious and makes no sense -- unless it's all just a giant simulation.
---
I’ve gotten used to it, and wasting stimpaks is no biggie for me as a friend and I have at least 140 total on us
---
My two friends who used the trial keys to play beta are often listed as online...but they never bought the game...
---
Escavator is around as bad as Radier (god I have horrible spelling) only difference is escavator gives 100 extra carry weight on TOP of the ones you get from just wearing a Power Armor 
---
Hey, a little late but I think I found what the issue is here. Looks like you need to be really close to a teammate for it to work on you if you are sharing it. Try standing right next to him and should proc a few times, then you guys can space out a little bit until his rads build up again.
---
The Excavator is definitely useful, but I just can’t stand all that yellow. I usually have a carry weight of 480 lbs without being in any Power Armor.
---
Thanks! I just see a lot of ppl posting “no duping” while posing about their shop. Didn’t know if there was some unforeseen consequence on the receiving side. Thanks

No problem.  Was able to dig up an old thread I remembered:

Colin was born in the vault, his parents were in government. He grew up fascinated with machines and was constantly building things. As a teen he started rebelling against his parents pure, clean cut suburban idyllic nature and fully embraced being a greaser. Out in Appalachia he travels with his best friend Jimbo collecting scrap and working on projects, Jimbo is the brains knowing tons about SCIENCE! And chemistry, Colin is a great mechanic and solid shot, becoming his friends pseudo enforcer despite his run of the mill frame. The two recently begun refurbishing vintage power armor they find out in the ruins.

People who are patient enough to read notes and listen to holotapes. There’s a good story but it needs uncovering.
---
Yeah i'm all for robot vendors... that 30% thing though?  Like I list it at 100, someone buys it for 100, i get 130?  That's just printing caps... unless there's also like at least a 30% tax.
---
Otherwise you could just generate infinite caps.

I found an unexploded one near Vault 76 to the east-ish like only 2nd day of my play, maybe level 8.  Fortunately I cut the right wire.
---
On a semi-related note, the other day I happened to be wandering the wastes and got to see the nuke missile being launcher from a silo like 50 meters away from where I was.  I wasn't close enough to see it leave the silo, but was walking and then the big WHOOOOOOSH and seeing the missile launch upwards.
---
Honestly, I think the friend list just bugs and is showing the wrong ppl online. I've had it happen many times to two friends that don't play.

When I look again later, it's other people online instead.

The duped ‘item’ doesn’t know it’s duped. It works just like the copy from what it’s made from.  How are you to know if the item is duped unless you want to be that guy who accuses a seller of duping after investing the time to both meet up in game to make a deal. Which would fall apart very fast after said accusation. I highly doubt a duper selling a duped item will admit it’s a duped item. I feel like I’m duping responding to these duping threads.

It's trash.

You can only have water purifiers and the resource extractors, every box you can make is you stash box

Thank you for the nice spot.

If your on PC we have a text chat mod a modder made when the game launched. It's very well made and easy to use.
---
Only issue is it is not used by many so hard to get many others on any given server with it. So its definitely something they can add.
---
Use fo76market
---
I’ve noticed that places I check regularly, like the meds box outside of the church in flatwoods and the duct tape off the overseers camp don’t always spawn for me. That or they’re there and I just can’t pick them up

Thanks... sorry for the duped question.. 
---
I'm ready for the blow back on this. Once they fix the dupe, they need to delete them. Yes it will delete mine but it's worth it to fix the saturation of these weapons.
---
Eh my only argument there is it takes less purified water than boiled to fill the water meter. Less water being carried is always good.

Can we do the same with all perks that are required to build stuff? Finding blueprints is annyoing as it is, but to constantly swap build perks is no fun.
---
I have 2 reasons.
---
1) I believe it will make my crafting durability less than it could be. Not a huge deal.
---
2) My build is so tight and so specific, that I don't even have the 2 special points to move to luck for Starched Genes.
---
Still, I appreciate the reply and the info. Some of my other characters can probably spare 2 points somewhere.
---
The Perk system is crap. But random card packs foster addiction, so publishers love them.

Marsupial,speed demon paired with jetpack.  Speed matters.  Calibrated shocks on the legs and you're min/max as they come.  Get optimized servos for arms if you are melee.  Also suggest molotovs or a tesla rifle for groups

---
Xbox here, had the same problem when it came to ghouls. I had to uninstall/reinstall for it to stop than I notice whenever I would join a group this crash would happen soon after. So look like no groups for me.
---
Yeah I know, but how will that affect my perks in Intelligence and other things? 
---
Yeah I like this idea - basically just group perks into two categories Active and Passive (for the situational perks). Active perks cost SPECIAL points, Passive perks don't.
---
Agree in edge case like gunsmith - that would be something like a hybrid (maybe unlocks two "perks" at once) - passive perk is to build level # gun improvements. Active perk is to reduce wear and tear on weapons.
---
For passive perks - I still think that you should have a requirement to have # of the special stat however. So in order to get passive gunsmith maxed - would still need 5 int.

Ive encountered the Mothman several times now outside of that quest. A couple of times were after cooking and eating mothman eggs so I have had the same suspicions, though it could be coincidence. One time when farming the whitesprings it turned up at my camp for a battle. Seen two outside of Huntersville around that irradiated crater. This was when I was actively hunting for him to see if he could be tamed as a pet for my camp (alas, he cannot), and had a mothman omelete while doing so.. Seen two in the mire as well, outside of camp venture (theres a random spawn location there). Love the Mothman, I hope they expand on that cryptid and the others in future.
---
I made a post suggesting extra content where I suggest a new perk 'Cryptozoologist' that would allow us to pacify/tame cryptid pets. If anyones interested in looking at and possibly upvoting the idea (which is part of a much larger idea), I'll comment the link.
---
Oh god those are the worst!! 
---
Gt is sniperbeast add me :)
---
 theres several first aid kits at morgantown and watoga medical
---
But I could loot them now
---
And play all night, then try again tomorrow and they are still empty.
---
A prime reciever is the strongest receiver for a gun. It jumps the guns damage to the same as the hardened reciever and makes it so the gun now can only shoot Ultracite ammo. A special ammo crafted by using stable flux. The benefit is it does either 20% or 30% (Cant remember) more damage to scorch beasts and the scorched queen. 
---
It’s been really unstable for me 
---
The great design misstep of all Bethesda games since Skyrim: keep the RPG like non combat perks/skills...ditch the RPG like non combat means of accomplishing anything in the game...
---
So you could compare it a little to Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain?

I enjoyd F3, FNV but didnt enjoy F4

On my main character, my crafter, I dont even have 2 stat points to spare. But I'll keep that in mind for other characters. I'm hoping to get T-60 Jetpacks, that could help some. Thanks!
---
I might have something for you
---
You people are awful, as if the guys selling 1* and non godtier 3* weapons are all dupers.  Brutal.
---
nobody cares, edgelord
---
Xbox here, had to uninstall/reinstall for it to stop. Than notice whenever I would join a group the crash would soon after happen again. Looks like no groups for me.
---
If you're high enough level to handle the southern Mire/northern Bog area you can go to The General's Steakhouse. The farm out back has all the ingredients to create adhesive or start your own farm.
---
Fusion core glitch strikes again. 
---
This is a really nice idea. Like some king of the hill type of mode. Could fit lore-wise, too.
---
Perhaps we need to set up a subreddit like /r/76sandbox where people post questions/theories and other players who are in a position to answer test the theory and report results.
---

My brother lives at the Whitespring.  I wonder if it was his camp you wrecked.
---
Never had to since weeks. Patches?
---
Yeah...
---
Forgetting about chemist and super duper, are we?
---
No, they provide 3 uses, where as diluting a stim with two PW ultimately provides only 2 uses. 
---
When you’re 80+% irradiated and running a small health pool, how much they actually heal is irrelevant. How many times you get to use them is king.  
---
I didn't have PA chassis with me, and didn't see one there. I know where to find one though, so I'll have another try.
---
;)
---
RiP..I have multiple full sets
---
Reeeeeeeee
---
Yea and the next elder scrolls game is a phone game with tap combat mechanics lol. They sure know what theyre doing.
---
Thanks for the information!
---
I never get mad since I know it could also be an alt regardless, but if they have bad etiquette i'll watch them get swarmed by lvl 62's and eat shit.
---
It does not affect your perks. All you do is lose 4 intelligence points. In this game, intelligence decides the durability of items you craft so anything you craft will have very slightly lower max durability. 
---
wow, just wow
---
No.
---
In the strategy guide it references raids with the sealed vaults. 
---
I like the part about there benefits to being un-mutated. But I'm not so hot on not-mutated perks, because it would become just a different perk sink for a different kind of ability that would probably be too good to pass up. So that might worsen my stress. :)
---
It’s goes to your inventory after a while so I guess he either drops it or re-drops it every once in a while when it gets recalled 
---
If u like to grind and feel like u have achieved something then it's right game for you 
---
This is like a dream theory you hear about for cartoons. No hard evidence and way to many holes.
---
The Zetans will return
---
Except in end game. Lol.
---
This game isnt successful enough for all that. 
---
Why did this get downvoted? This sub is ridiculous.
---
I just hit lvl 50 and have gotten 3 lvl 1 lock picking cards.  Maxed out Luck my ass.
---
No worries I wouldn’t worry about buying duped weapons. If you find a gun you want at a good price don’t over think it and just buy it. As long as the seller doesn’t blatantly brag its duped which he won’t, your good. As long as you’re not duping it’s not your problem it’s Bethesda’s.
---
Sutton Station is a part of the Raider's vendor pool.
---
&gt; no nothing
---
/facepalm
---
Has nothing to do with tse or OP melee weapons
---
If hes a lot higher level, hes going to be stronger and have better perks and better gear.
---
Ok this helps thank you, I like it when people are specific. 
---
I've been told the farm in the northwest corner of the map is plant heaven, but light on the mobs. I haven't personally tried it, though. 
---
It’s best suited for Wanderers. 
---
haha, I have been playing for quite a while MMO's and a lot of English speakers just "hate" Spanish speakers, you can dig a little bit more in google if you like.
---
Also, allegedly, helps with hacking and getting stuff from scrapping. 
---
"Intelligence is a measure of your overall mental acuity, and effects your ability to hack terminals, the condition and durability of items that you craft, and the return you get from scrapping."
---
It's not that high level players think lowbies shouldn't be there. It's just that they see a level 15 and they get their pants all wet thinking about killing someone who won't be able to fight back.
---
First I need enough camp budget to be able to afford then in addition to an aesthetically pleasing and fully functional home. 
---
Yes, one of the best imo
---
It kind of sounds like this, but I'm not sure https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ 
---
#The above comment likely contains a rick roll!
---
^(Beep boop: downvote to delete)
---
Exactly  :)  It's south of them. I'm gonna grab a screenshot and edit to the first post where it is on the map.
---
Umm lol then it goes back to your inventory in 60s, so unless he's specifically putting it down for the visitor to view, he must be dropping it.
---
You can deploy all the suits you have and still have it bound to you. No need to drop it, which like you said enables others to take it. 
---
U do u man, but let me try one last time to convince u.
---
If your build has White Knight, which every build should (or the power armor equivalent) then you absolutely WILL NOT see the negative effect (if there is any at all) of Marsupial (the most important mutation).
---
I do not run Starched Genes at all so technically I should be seeing a major decrease in durability. But I’m telling u there absolutely isn’t one. There is absolutely no reason to not have Marsupial from a statistical point if view.
---
Sorry if this came off as rude, I really doubt mean it to be. I just want u to know that there are no downsides and you don’t need Starched Genes so it absolutely should fit into your any build.
---
Good luck and I hope you keep having fun playing mate.
---
Ya I've seen that but with 10 or 30 intelligence my hacking and scrapping has been the same so I ignore it 
---
Honestly?  I feel like this game is a multiplayer online game that's being held to a single player standard.  Online games have a lot of issues at first.  There are so many considerations to that single 
---
Yes! This is the better discussion. Not whining about the 2 communities playing within the crappy parameters we have now. THIS IS CALLED A BREAKTHROUGH! 
---
I just hope you cant jump to pvp server from a pve server. You should have to reroll a PvP toon. Or move permanently to the pvp server at launch week only. 
---
 If you could level up and grind on pve - it takes the stakes away and creates a battle royale style game.  No consequence is no fun imo. If you could stash everything and grind peacefully in pve servers... Meh. 
---
If you have to stay on the pvp server its more survival pvp which i am more in favor of. I prefer a very difficult game. Id like have to look over my shoulder for players as i leveled up or farm.  Id like to hunt other players as they level up or farm. Maybe expand drops to food water, and junk. Or a slight chance for a weapon or armor.(HARDCORE!)
---
PS: I had surgery this morning and this thread is a blur!
---
Is it bad that I kill them every time I see them? 
---
Their babbling is too annoying to left undisputed. 
---
It's an interesting idea.
---
I would still like the option to join either PvP or pve servers as I see fit for my chosen gaming time.  
---
Personally I would rather the new vaults to have new stuff for everyone, not geared toward PvP.
---
Upvote for the new idea though, even though I would rather see dedicated PvP servers instead.
---
If there is one feature request from this list that is of most importance, it's the ability to scrap legendaries. How I would see this implemented is having a chance to learn how to craft the legendary prefix onto another item, and getting special mats required to do so from the scrapping as well. Since PVP is a big part of this game, we need a guaranteed way to get the super nice legendary prefix combinations, when if it takes some grinding 
---
You can deploy/display all the PA suits you have temporarily. They get recalled to your inventory after a minute or so. 
---
I hope they are proper Raids... hard, that require a prepared group to succeed.
---
The Mothman’s origins are unknown and the Flatwoods Monster is a member if a zetan science division.
---
That is one of my next plans. I had thought of trying to ride it, trying to hit it to see if it detonates, seeing if I can fall inside.. 
---
Now, that... that is a nice base. How do you deal with mobs who happen to wander by and attack it?
---
&gt; After getting the perk for extended duration
---
Fusion cores are so plentiful that the only thing that matters is power/weight ratio. Power user doubles your power/weight while batteries includes multiplies it by ten. The added benefit is you can carry thousands of fusion cells.
---
Didn't think scraping PA parts gave mods
---
This absolutely needs to happen!!!
---
It'd be cool if we could get perk packs by "returning" extra cards. 
---
At this point they just have to equip/swap the cards to do that anyway. This would just remove that step.
---
Ask the original guy that posted then, I highly don't he just dropped all his power armor. Btw you should text it yourself it gives you the 60 sec warning about 30 sec after you place your power you have almost 1 min 30 seconds before it's recalled.
---
Umm lol
---
One dog
---
Last time I found a bomb I had another prompt because my luck was high.
---
Heh, yeah in general the perk system is kinda weird.  "Now I'm a cannibal! Now I'm not!" "Now I'm a shotgun expert! Now...I kinda forgot how to be effective with them!" "I have night vision and regeneration, now I don't but I can swim through radiation water and radiation heals me!"
---
its just all over the board.
---
Sounds like quite the session, good read. Makes me want to play even more, I'm currently stuck at work in my cubicle....
---
For 2 minutes each, by placing them. And then they recall.  If you know of a way other than dropping them, I'd love to know. It would make swapping pieces and repairing multiple suits much easier.
---
What system are you on? 
---
How do I get a normal flair? I would like to know as they seem cool
---
&gt;It will be used as 1hour consumables soon. 
---
Got a source for that info?
---
Nice but sad. FYI if that happens and you remember their tag you can find them on your recent player list.
---
I think its 24 rl hours for reset on boxes and stuff sitting out on shelves, tables, etc.
---
What system are you on?  I've read that if you play on PC and leave the client in sleep mode "time" won't pass for the reset.
---
If any of this is wrong I'll happily be corrected.
---
If you like to loot junk and hoard em in your stash then this is perfect

Brazzers
---
Lol, stupid bot spoils the fun. I should have changed the URL.
---
If he's dropping the power armor he's probably dupping them and giving them out for free. Wouldn't doubt that.
---
I agree.  Sad thing is, this sub would be full of people crying about how their TSE was legit and not duped.  Oh well.  As someone stated earlier, two-shot and explosive should the same slot and never appear on the same weapon.   
---
I agree,  one of the best experiences I've had k I'm currently @ 90) was with my best friend (level 100+)  and his son, who was a level 5, to the prime fissure nuke zone.  He died a million times,  but it didn't matter.  Everyone in the zone let him get shots in,  and he had a blast.  
---
So, the deal with PA is that it really isn't optional. I run without power armor 99% of the time. But anytime scorchbeasts or nukes are involved; you pretty much need it. 
---
There are hidden flags so that even with the same resists, you take more damage without PA. 
---
I should also note; that I can get away with a lot of what I do because my friend is the crafter. 
---
As for the junk, yeah, it can be a problem. I've just been able to, usually, able to run light. 
---
Yeah you just go to your 'modify' interface and hover over an extractor and it'll show a 'lock' option with various levels/material costs.
---
Depends on which device you view reddit on.  If your on PC you can find your name on the side bar and click on the (EDIT) next to your name and pick your flair.
---
There is a new power armor glitch, can’t exit, enter, or drain fusion core. Tried new chassis, pvp, unequipping, etc...
---
Oh ok my bad
---
ammo factory when there is lucky hole mine? o´boi.
---
I gave up on playing. I have a very high end PC, everything I play is in ultra detail and close to 80fps. This game lags so bad, and crashes or disconnects so often, I just can't deal with it. I've submitted to going through my newly acquired games I got on steam sales. I'll go back to FO76 in probably a half a year or so. Assuming there's even servers online and people playing due to the fallout of players.
---
I'd rather risk getting an unfavorable mutation than waste another perk slot.
---
If I'm taking to many rads I'll pop it on or put on my hazmat suit.
---
Otherwise it's just taking up space for more dps in my build.
---
You can get serums for as low as 500 caps so playing chance with radway to get rid of the ones you don't want doesn't hurt the bank as much if it removes one that you do.
---
Another near Camden Yard, I think
---
I did find their username in my video. But the never accepted the request, so...rip me. Hopefully somebody else that just likes to help will find them. 
---
Finally, I was looking for this since we don't have fast travel mats and I kept getting spawned below my cliffside camp.
---
This! Been my thoughts since day 1. I've never seen an online game without a ton of issues at first. 
---
What's really weird is on one spawn he had 500 fusion cores on him. I'd never want to get into melee with him if he has that sort of carry weight.
---
I don't find myself in a lot of situations where I'm getting radiated enough to mutate.
---
So it works for me.
---
&gt;  But honestly the people i feel are most pissed are people who sadly can't make friends and and can't experience appalachia with people, they wanted "MUH FALLOUT 5" so they could roleplay as their own god complex character.
---
How far up Bethesda's ass do you have to be to project social problems and mental issues on people instead of just accepting that the game has legit issues players don't like?
---
I am playing on PS4,
---
And it seems to be way longer than 24 hours. 
---
Example, yesterday afternoon I looted all of Morgantown airport, now its evening and the stuff is still gone. 
---
Maybe the same applies for leaving the ps4 on and leaving it on the menu screen.
---
Why has this not been asked before/why does this have no upvotes? You're right, it makes no sense.
---
Just in case you don't check back this is where it is on the map, south of Yellow Sandy's Still.

My *SOOTHING VOICE*!!!

That second one is brill!

I’m “open” to all offers but if you make a bad one I won’t reply

Well some people would

Sadly no, just 20 or so mole rats though.

It is. I’m very distraught over it.

Thanks for noticing!

I’d be down to play

I've been looking for a specific non explosive gatling for so long that I know people have thrown away because it wasn't TSE. It's frustrating 
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10  Submit a ticket under feedback.
---
You can shimmy up to the pipe and leave room to exit behind and leave your power armor in the water. Then just collect, swim out and redress. Might want to throw on Aquaboy/Girl before you exit the PA. 
---
Done it two or three times now ... 
---
If I dont help kill something the loot shows up empty.  Could that be implemented for pvp?  Then they have to shoot you at least once to get a shot at your loot, entering them into the wanted system.
---
I see the reasoning behind their pvp slap.  It's a compromise that right now that kind of works, kind of doesn't.  I know some people (me) would love full pvp servers.
---
Should be right about here. Have a gander at me talking a stroll on top of a missile silo lol
---
https://imgur.com/a/fUptDW0
---
Maybe.
---
Im on xbox and all boxes, med kits, stuff aitting out resets for me after 24 hours.  I also power my system down completely when it is not in use.
---
I wish I could be of more help.
---
No you are using idiocy as a fact. If you simply see the TSE weapons that people have they are all the same weapon. No one has any other affixes at all. And you are talking about your lackluster pick up of a gatling laser with just explosive when this thread is about TWO SHOT EXPLOSIVE. Maybe that will be more clear in the coming hours for you. Thank you for your time.
---
It's gotten so much worse since the recent hotfix to fix nuke codes. Before it was maybe 2 or 3 DC in a 4-6 hour session. Now it's almost every 30-60 minutes.
---
yeah that'll do it lol
---
This guy gets it.
---
north dakota is on the map for nuke hits, they got the silos...i tell my kids, we are next to a target too, and we are just outside the red zone..so we have a good chance of surviving a nuke...i need to search online for some of these maps we had to study back in the 80's
---
Yes I did, piss off.
---
Well these where just a bunch of randoms so I was going for the sheer force of numbers approach 
---
Ya I just run from the scorchbeasts right now other than the only one I killed at whitesprings with all the robots doing the majority of the damage.
---
What's a good level to set off a nuke, I collect trophies on ps4 and need to do so one of these days to get the trophy.
---
The reward and the effect on the sub-stations. Fully repaired activates all of the subs in some of the other workshops for power.
---
Its all good man. Thanks for your 2 cents. Any feedback is appreciated, even if its speculations
---
Seeing as my main character is a melee build whenever I come across a locked door/terminal I just hit it with my hammer and carry on while saying to my friends that grug too dumb to pick lock/hack 
---
Probably nothing on the other side of the door I need anyway
---
Or like get our own Mulder and Scully to track down the truth? 
---
He definitely deserved to be smitten by your wrath. Excellent Moana reference, btw! 😀
---
&gt;, if I take a newer, lower level character there, that's about the only time I encounter open hostility from other players. They seem to feel that someone below say level 25 has no reason to be there.
---
I've seen some people here call people some variation of 
---
"hazmat suiters" 
---
I've been stimpacked by the low level guy who dragged a bunch of gouls on top of me accidentally so it's a real mixed bag but there's no way they are more annoying than people using TSE or full melee clearing so you don't get any loot or XP. 
---
Now you mention it, I do think I've come across that pied piper bot. Maybe he's stuck underground for some reason?
---
What's the range on it? Like, could it hit something at whitesprings from twin lakes? 
---
I need that yarn
---
Greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat now i've got an entire sub of folks thinking i'm some sort of elitist cunt because i didn't insult myself enough when i described my drunken wailing. 
---
Fuck scorchbeasts. The least fun creature to fight in all of the fallout games
---
No they are real, very rare to get from a machine though apparently easier now.
---
Ah that's too bad.  I've no doubt I will find plenty of hate on google, so i'll pass on that, but I wish you all the best.

Looks like I'm hunting around the mire later

Somebody who hates a product cannot be a shill. Quit trying so damn hard to insult people who don't employ your blindness. 
---
Until they fix it, no. I used it early on and the only thing it was really good for was acting as bait. A lot of the time he spawns in with no hat or gun. It seemed the faster he spawned, the more likely he was to glitch in that manner. 
---
The potential I think is there it’s just too glitchy to make a huge difference. 
---
I only unlock very hard (lockpick skill of 3) locks at this point. Theyre the only things worth looting half the time. That and medkits.....im always out of fucling stimpacks

That's pretty bad

Why are you guys not telling him about the orbital strike in his base if he trys to repair said dupe?

They did, in fact, say that.

Ehh I tried

more quests and a framework to get people working together would be great. Bring in a robot supervillain!
---
Cats are kill on sight either way...
---
Realistically some many things have been duped by the millions, even stimpacks, ammo, junk, nuka colas (for caps), treasure maps, that anything you buy from another player at this point is most likely duped at some point. 
---
You and me both, thank you!

Power cycle your console. Power it off and unplug for 10 seconds. Try again.

I had this same problem until I did that.

I would LOVE a nuke area like whitesprings but with super mutants, just gobs of super mutated super mutants

Please tell me a number of gun break too quickly. I swear all energy weapons are only good for two reloads and my missile launcher does fair much better. I have lucky draw and lvl 5 gun... thing and rank 3 weapon artisan.  I just want to shoot something a couple of times

I left a goodie bag outside vault 76 today and left, few min. Later a level 2 was in the area and bag was gone. Hope they like the goods :D

That's cosmetic, that'll cost extra

Because it's fun. 
---
I would like to see a sort by food% and sort by water% in the aid item menu 
---
&gt; Right I mean why are we getting attacked for liking the game and seeing the good In it?
---
Because you can't simply "see the good in it" without insulting people who don't agree with you. 
---
Ha, my husband just said the same thing and complained about my chameleon.  I did it so I could move a little less jerkily.
---
Yeah I canned it, I had no idea it worked like that, will have to be more careful
---
Someone posted it has no ingame matter, and just flies through the models.
---
If your Xbox pm me, unfortunately I can't help with PS4 or computer 
---
Ha ha.

Definitely, that and try to deny mobs, or slap damage them low enough that mobs can easily swarm them.  
---
If they aren't gonna play nice, neither am I.

i would like the artillery plans, adding you now

Ive been error code dc'd over 20 times and its happened 11 days in a row. I like the fallout series and have platinumed every other game but 76 has me playing less and less. Hopefully they address some of the issues but im not holding my breath.
---
   On the other hand my canadian friend has almost no problems and plays it for hours. 
---
He's over lvl 100 and really didn't believe me untill i showed him some video of issues in game.
---
   Probably doesn't help you make a decision but that's been my experience with 76. Unplayable for some and completely fine for others
---
The truth is out there.
---
Slim Pickens perk must be active.
---
Yup. ESO added the DLC with the sewers who had pvp vendors, pvp currency, with pvp gear, pvp boss raids and a ton of fixes to their open world pvp zone. Problem is meta pvp gear was still in pve dungeons making the communities mix.  Pve players were way more optomized for these raids and werent kind to people joining a dungeon in pvp gear. Unless you had a good guild. 
---
This happened over a year after launch i believe.  It was awesome for a long time. I only stopped playing this year.
---
Fingers crossed for this game getting a great PvP makeover before 2020. And some fixes this month that at least brings more people into pvp
---
There's one of those things which regularly spawns on the bridge to the northeast of Harper's Ferry. Normally they have pretty good loot, including hermit crab meat, which is a high-quality food item once cooked.

Thank you!  The bunker was already there, but I did the top.  I'm at 101 now, buy feel like I'm only 50.

I had the issue of "the game didn't show the second legendary effect what do you mean it's explosive" since all I saw was Ghoul-Slayer.

&gt; They dug too deep, and you just woke him. Tentacle monsters everywhere, several crowned enemies. Once all crowns are killed, spawn Him. 
---
Once all crowned enemies get killed, all the players inside the cave will hear a massive scream and get teleported to a dark room, Then Him will spawn, if any player was outside the cave wont be able to continue the event
---
The cave will also be locked
---
That was suggested the other day as an etiquette 'good thing' to do if you weren't going to be around your base all the time.  If you're there actively farming, sure use your turrets, if you're going to be away, close your garage door or shutters/etc.
---
I mean, i totally agree, because its annoying. But at the same time, theres no pack of cards in real life that take into account what cards you already have.
---
I’m in the same boat with a two-shot handmade.  Not going to buy a TSE because there’s a 95% chance it’s a dupe and I can’t support that.  If I were to find one legit i would use it but not buying one 
---
I had an explosive (just explosive) handmade. Unfortunately I discarded it since it was back when explosive just made enemies regen health and it was only a level 35.
---
I saw a nanny Mr. Handy (I assume that’s Ms. Nanny) who told me stories. She was kinda near the dam north of Morgantown.
---
I did kill it after I heard the stories though.
---
Can anyone with the right level just enter those suits and steal them?
---
I was wondering what the satellite was, I thought it was just there
---
If they'd cost anything like the OP said you would have many more people having those perks, that was my point. 
---
But right now you only do if your build allows it.
---
 Like for example my melee build only has 1 perception so i only have the level 1. I f they didn't cost anything i'd have a level 3 with only 1 perception and the ability to steal from your camp which makes no sense.
---
Wes tek is good 
---
Bulk copper is a great sell!

Good point, maybe Bethesda is affectively dealing with the duping problem because they are setting up foundation for the fo76 economy ... a foundation of lies... haha

Problem with zero cost perks is getting all three active with no points in relevant special. Either need to correct this for all non combat passives (armor smith, chemist, super duper, etc) or none. I consider weight reducers to be combat perks and should never be zero cost.
---
Gunsmith being a five rank skill is a side issue, too. You can unlock every aspect of the game with three points in all specials (lockpick, hack, base building, armor smithing, energy guns), except if you want to craft every gun and melee mod you need int 5. I guess physical mods are a way to get access without int 5, but it's not quite the same.

My main right now is a quad explosive faster crit gain lever action rifle. It's going to suck when they fix lever action reload animation.

The resort is technically in the forest at the edge of the savage divide. It's in a low level zone. That's all the info you need. 
---
I’d probably still remove it to be safe. Just drink it in your camp or somewhere safe to make sure you don’t get any mutations you don’t want, or lose any you want to keep.
---
I hope Red Dead 2 has Westworld references.
---
I would say mid 40s, as you'll be fighting things in the 60s. If you just follow the questlines that's when you'll get there anyway. 
---
I love this spot.  Hobo life is good too, don't knock it!

So what you're really saying is you aren't a trader and have no idea what's out there, because there's plenty of different affixes that come on 2 shot explosive and you see them all the time if you watch the markets.  You'll also see difference in levels in those items, but you're not looking for that, you're looking for the opposite.  The real idiot here is the one making false claims and spouting more nonsense without any data whatsoever.

I have my camp in the cliffs North of West tech when I log in or ft back home i sneak over and Chuck a smoke grenade over the wall into the parking lot. The run back k to my defenses and watch the mutants bodies fly. It's glorious.
---
A very constructive comment, Merci beaucoup.
---
Is there any way to fix this? I've had one single industrial sized water purifier that I cant scrap from the storage, and it says it takes up a whopping 24% storage space... its been weeks and it's really irritating me. 
---
 It affects the number of words you have to guess from I believe. 
---
omg it never crossed my mind
---
fuck they're watching me
---
Haha yes yes earn the spoils of war in blood and tears hahahaha!

A sensible solution that would actually fit the concept of playing cards would be to allow creating decks of cards that you can swap in and out.
---
Techinically after lv 50 we are all the same. Different build but same quantity of Special point
---
Thanks for advice but ive looked through the subs and tried everything i could find. Including trying wi fi as another post suggested but nothing has helped ;(
---
    Happy gaming!
---
I have a few TSE weapons, but I rarely use them. They just aren't fun. Only reason I still have them is because I'm holding out hope that Bethesda will replace the explosive effect in the esm to something else, like armor piercing 
---
You're welcome, douche.
---
I don't think there's a guaranteed spawn location for it, and I don't think any vendor can sell it either. Pretty sure you just have to get lucky and find the plans for it. 
---
[I found the plans for it once and made a post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2bf2v/psa_the_brotherhood_officer_suit_is_in_the_game/)

Count me in!
---
Who knows anymore. It is what it is. Theres no way to know if something is duped and there is no downside to it. 4 of my friends bought gauss rifles this week and they all have the sake legendary bonuses. Duped? Most likely. But we'll never know.
---
That just generally describes the perk cards that fall under Intelligence though. A temporary debuff doesn't remove cards.
---
If someone gets out of their powersuit, can someone else steal it? 
---
Yabbut dat carry weight dough! 
---
I was about to say 'no shit' but then I realized I didn't know that... so thank you.
---
I gave up on it. Another user suggested I look for a particular body north of 76, it looked like they died delivering it on a bike. After I took it back to my camp I found out it couldn't be used for the recipe, only broken down for antiseptic and something else. Either it was a fake and part of a story, (it did kind of look like yellow paint with a sloppy label), or the royal jelly is bugged currently.

Of all of the random encounters that people have mentioned in response to my comment, and all of the ones I've heard of before, this is one which I've never heard anyone else mention. I've found a museum way up north with a bunch of civil war-era costumes in it, so I know those are existing items in the game, and I presume that one of them is being worn by the corpse in question. This must be one of the rarest random encounters. 
---
same &lt;3
---
Yes but OP said he was level 11. I'd certainly hope a level 50+ could kill him.
---
There’s gotta be at least *one* drawback to melee ;) /s
---
This is basically why I feel like I can’t trade with anyone but people I know that I know do not dupe, it’s rather frustrating feeling like you can’t trade properly without inadvertently supporting duping, which I refuse to do.
