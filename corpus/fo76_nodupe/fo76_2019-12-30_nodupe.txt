Dogwood 100%. I don‚Äôt mind tea time. I haven‚Äôt really done census violence. Maybe done it once. Don‚Äôt really remember what you do tbh.

---
ah lol my bad

The point people are missing is that this happens in tons of games. in GTAO I had a windmill in my small apartment when I spawned in (no that's not meant to be there). Couldn't see or do anything. Jumping lobby wouldn't fix it because it was in my files now. I'd have to close and start the game, which genuinely takes about 12 minutes to load up the online mode. Only the next time my car was chased by a UFO everywhere it went. There's a way of sniping people through building with a certain scope. Often there are ways of getting under the map and shooting people above you or invincibility. People have had characters ruined by more malicious stuff too. Character level changed to -1000. Or losing all their money. Nobody was ever saying it was Rockstar's fault these people found a way to do it because **people always find a way to do it**. People are dicks. There's still duping in GTAO too. A game 5 years old. Although (unlike Bethesda) they sometimes patch new duping methods in a couple of hours. An hour later? Another pops up with a workaround. Maybe that will last a couple of days before patch.
---

---
However the difference is the next bit: you get caught duping and selling cars? They take action. You get banned.
---
TL;DR: Cheats / hacks / mods are not Bethesda's fault. It happens. But not banning them and patching quickly is their fault.
---
I still check in on FO76 after Fallout 1st insulted me enough to walk away. 
---
Stop giving Bethesda your money and force them to build products worth paying for. Then you can avoid having to have these discussions completely. Shitty game-breaking bugs don't exist for people to exploit so they can make kids cry when Bethesda makes stuff worth paying for.
---
solar and thorn are not the PA(strangler)
---
PA is only dropable because its a bug bethesda didnt patch yet
---
What was dropped in this game?
---
sneak multiplier is getting rejected by the server if there are other players or mobs involved in fights with sbq
---
Your fault for buying into this scam. Staggering that people are still surprised at Bethesda's constant lies and incompetence.
---
Awesome
---
That line was crossed before the game came out... remember canvas bags?
---
You people need to stop rewarding Bethesda for taking advantage of you. Stop with the impulse buys, and reward a developer that actually cares (ie: someone else, indie most likely).
---
Which I game I can list a few and at least the Bethesda ones anyway there is also a list of cut content that was partially left int 76 lile all the bio enhancing plans in arktos pharma that never get used and the barn prank mention by a dead wastelander on a note that never happened
---
I think he may have improved very slightly (based on the one video I watched recently that was just factual reporting). Fingers crossed it lasts.
---
I actually had it that way at first and was basically using it as a sniper rifle. Since I already use my lever action as a sniper rifle it doesn‚Äôt make sense to have two different guns that effectively do the same thing if one doesn‚Äôt do nearly as much damage per shot as the other. Without buffs from chems and food and whatnot my lever action does over 430 damage, meanwhile the handmade nodded as a sniper rifle only does 180 ish. Modded to be an automatic it only does about 90 to 120 but I can put more bullets down range much quicker. 180 damage at a time is good but 120 damage per bullet fired rapidly is more effective. The difference between using an sword and a weed wacker to cut tall grass. 
---
Also it‚Äôs just fun to switch to it sometimes and uses less ap in vats per shot.
---
The one you're thinking of has become the entrance to vault 79. No more camping there...
---
Ah, didn‚Äôt know that.
---
Exactly. I‚Äôve been trying to get good thorn armor rolls and my friend was able to roll 13 of the left armor till he got a god tier piece and still have hundreds of vault steel left over
---
I am asking about content for 76 that was promised and never released, not stuff that was changed behindt he scenes. That‚Äôs a natural consequence of the development cycle and not an all abnormal or unexpected.
---
True, I guess it does boil down to personal opinion. When people ask me I recommend they buy it full price and get fallout first so. We don't see eye to eye, but I do appreciate the civil responses. Some people on here get down right zealous.
---
the fastest way is melee unarmed, any bloodied power attack weapon can melt her because food dmg buffs all stack, then chems and on top of that nukashine. I think TYR made a video about this build a while ago.
---
Last time I did that one it was over run by mutants. Waste of time.
---
They *might have* investigated it straight away but spent time checking it didn't open other worse doors or fuck up something else. Usually when they patch something, something else breaks.
---
[deleted]
---
That is literally what he did. "player" that you see in those videos of juicehead? He is a dataminer that reported it a week before it went public with a fix for it!
---
Fire berry drink that was never introduced in bivs questline was shown off in the nukashine trailer along with the drink kegs
---
I just had a holiday scorch show up at my campü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah they nerfed Mothman eggs like three times now. It's the Whitesprings of consumables
---
In F76 you‚Äôre limited to the amount of points you can spend on SPECIAL points. You definitely want to find a play style and stick with it, as in if you like rifles spec into Perception or if you like heavy/melee weapons spec into Strength. Honestly at the moment if you don‚Äôt really need Endurance or Charisma since they don‚Äôt really provide any valuable high level perk cards. If you want some more help I‚Äôm also on PS4 so feel free to message me if you need to. I‚Äôm level 201 and run a stealth commando build:
---
Strength - 3
---
Perception - 15
---
Endurance - 3
---
Charisma - 3
---
Intelligence - 5
---
Agility - 15
---
Luck - 12
---
As you can see I‚Äôm very mini-maxed. I try to keep at least 3 into every point so I can run either a high level 3 card or multiple low level cards.
---
Makes sense. I vats kill almost everything so my handmade is more for crowd control/large enemies. Even without auto is crazy fast....well, compared to my hunting rifle.
---
It costs:
---
- 8 Adhesive
---
- 9 Aluminum
---
- 17 Bone Shards
---
- 11 Screws
---
- 14 Steel
---
As long as you have the Adhesive and Bone Shards, I can provide the rest!
---
This. You could basically get anything you wanted for the plan. Before the xmas event I saw the plan 3 times I think. I‚Äôve gotten 2 plasma grenade and 1 plasma mine plan in the last 3 days from presents plus the ultracite gatling laser x2 which I needed, and a bunch of other plans I didn‚Äôt know I didn‚Äôt have. And like 300 plans I already had that I will be giving away once the event ends to people who didn‚Äôt get everything they needed. Mostly head mount plans. Some of the mounts I have like 20 copies of now.
---
CV you‚Äôre basically escourting a protectron/killing enemies, don‚Äôt blame you for not remembering it‚Äôs pretty forgettable
---
that or at least balance the difficulty for second and third raid, there's no reason to make them harder when rewards are all the same. My suggestion for balancing:
---
First raid - ok no change needed
---
Second raid - toss one extra card for each section on every difficulty to make it a bit faster and less tedious, boost geck hp by about 50%
---
Third raid - time gain from pipes increased by 3sec on standard and expert, replace random spawns of pump codes with 4 crown honey beast that will have those in their belly, slay and take the code much more fun then memorising all spawns where some are so bad that only corner of the note is visible.
---
OMG sorry. You are right. They have a terrible history with this and now we cannot trust anything they say.
---
Anyway they said scorchbeasts are here to stay. I wouldn‚Äôt expect that to change.
---
Not with zero day hacks like this, major tech companies will actually pay hackers who find them and report them. There is no fear of human engineering or infected payloads as the company has them submit it through a ticket and then let their own techs analyze if they actually found an exploit they had missed.
---
It is harder to find a tech company that doesn't offer a bounty on exploits and hacks for their tech at this point.
---
Path of enlightenment! I swear it pops up every 15 minutes! I don't think I have ever seen one person actually doing it
---
Started out as melee, unarmed then 2h but that was when it was the meta and many SBQ fights had far too many melee so I went Heavy Gunner.  It's my fallback for farming/dinking around.
---
I play PUBG and have never had a windmill dropped on me. Actually, I think I ran into one legit hacker in the last two months. He was banned. How do I know PUBG is far far better and it isn't that I just don't know what to look for? I do an after battle examination of most of my games. I play passively and stealthy every game. No one has ever shown battle knowledge they shouldn't have had. No one shows the taletell sign of snapping to a targets head. No missing acceleration/deceleration of the mouse. No perfect tracking of targets. While I cannot say PUBG is free completely of cheaters, I can rest assured that I lost the match because others deserved the win. Cheating is a small exception, not the normal operating condition.
---
The best thing would be for there to be a hack of such significant magnitude that it finally ends this game once and for all. Maybe that form of protest is necessary for Bethesda to understand that their shady business practices arent acceptable.
---
I hate to sound like the parent but.. do two wrongs make a right? I doubt it. You are adding to an existing problem, no matter how you cut it you're hurting the players, not the company that you despise. Enjoy the downvotes I guess.
---
No I'm not saying that I'm saying anything from Robert Altman is a grain of salt and is the problem
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/avo6im/mothman_spawn_locations/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body

Hope this helps
---
No problem, friend.
---
Such a colossal waste of a location too, so many unique assets for a boring event and a footnote in the MQ. Deff in my top 5 places I hope gets repurposed post-Wastelanders.
---
Would make a sick 8v8 PvP arena also.
---
There are at least 13 people who don't want purple aids.
---
It can be bugged, like everything else.
---
This is why I switched to stealth commando (admittedly bloody).
---
My bloody FFR combat rifle one shots most things abs takes down everything bad the SBQ within 10 bullets at the very most).
---
They had a week, I'm sorry but an exploit that bad they should have shut down the servers and got that fixed that day. That is what any competent online game would do, or at the very least WARN THE PLAYER BASE. Not act like it doesn't exist and completely ignore it and let it run rampant during christmas when tons of new players are going to be joining the game.
---
That is just bad management and even worse PR. There is ZERO excuse for them letting this hack go public before they had fixed it when they had 7 days of prior notice with a full write up and fix from a dataminer.
---
You know you can turn the siren off?
---
Over my dead body!
---
I use a gatling plasma. The cores are easier to make and cheap to buy on the marketplace. Once primed, the yellowcake flux for ultracite cores, isn't as high in demand, so it more available too.
---
Buy Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas, and 4 as well. The whole series is insanely rich and detailed and crazy fun. You‚Äôll be hooked.
---
‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù
---
Yes your stash box it is al explained in the first quests. :) Have fun.
---
Two shot has been shit for a whole year now when it got nerfed!
---
thank you
---
Juicehead is well-informed and pretty objective, IMO.
---
Yes true
---
Neither should douchebags...
---
I found the body of one which my turrets had killed.  I got to loot its corpse.
---
The reason they went from named firearms to generic is that in that way there won't be any hassles for paying the licenses for the designs and names
---
Nice. Mine was on a load in. Was the only one I saw during that play session. Bot is still giving gifts though
---
All rise is trash tho only weapon worth getting at 50 is the perfect storm
---
Keep your head down and your powder dry.
---
I've actually swapped out adrenaline for gun Fu to see if I like that more. Not quite sure yet. I honestly wasn't finding it to be that useful personally as I'm one-shotting everything that isn't a SB or sheepsquatch. Definitely helpful during SBQ runs. 
---
I may still op to run auto in the the future but I like to conserve ammo. Plus my handmade is a BE and does tons of damage as-is.
---
Thank you so much kind stranger!
---
With the right perks it's fairly powerful
---
"WHY ARE YOU RUNNING"
---
Lol yeah in that case if you‚Äôre running bloodied I‚Äôd leave it as isüëçüèª
---
I‚Äôm willing to trade mine for a Mothman taxidermy plan :)
---
There's also 3 types of axe in the game so might wanna decide first which you want
---
Why do we even need to defend them? Can't you just come back to the overrun workshop and still just take from the collector?
---
Correction I was wrong the hack was patched but all the other hacks were not so much.  
---
Also Raider got his hateful comments and treats towards me taken down by the mods for his bad behavior... grow up kid.  Threatening people should not be tolerated.
---
I found never fast travelling meant I encountered him quite often, still I know a few players who have never met him yet because they zip all over the place!
---
Lol yeah I probably should've specified since that's a pretty strong weapon. My instigating hunting rifle pulls over 2k in head shots and the handmade pulls 1.5k. It's that damn strong.
---
WHaa???
---
Shoot. Are you sure?  I will change if so. Do we have any idea of the kid‚Äôs name?
---
I have a bunch of Berserk and Zealot's gear, some outfits and hats, and a few other legendary I've collected that I'd like to offer (I also have a few pieces of gear that are lower than lvl 50)
---
No problem, catch ya later. :)
---
The hats anyway
---
At this point I went ahead and deleted the game I am tired of the BS Bethesda has done.
---
I‚Äôll be on sometime this week catch ya (+~+)

The One is south-west of 76 from what I remember

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

The maker of Map76 quit because he was banned for submitting a glitch that could do some major damage. Please do your research before just blindly telling someone they are lying.
---
Both me and my husband play on PC and are willing to help. My name is MorgieShock and his SeraphymShock. Let us know what you need and we will do what we can.
---
They should just add in the cages from Fallout 4, maybe up the resources for the initial building but then all you have to do is replenish the bait. Or potentially it‚Äôd be like the Brahmin fertilizer where just by placing it down the corresponding animal is spawned with it.
---
He is just a little excited
---
Start at the mire's sunken church for more lore.
---
LOL primarily I am creating a basecharacter that performs really well without legendaries. once I have him fully optimised I may go back in for some mutations and legendaries and power armor upgrades. currently though its a bit to fun playing a zealot :) I have his food and ammo supply systems on point and able to easily keep up while still performing solo nuke launches and doing almost as much damage as my legendary set up. I think when I end my boycot and throw a legendary weap on there it will be a tad OP.
---
Shit I'll reinstall to help a kid out, I don't have much but I have an assload of stimpacks and other medical odds and ends that make life easier
---
[removed]
---
I'd help but I'm on Xbox
---
Your photo gallery will no longer show up in game (still in your capture gallery) but nothing else.
---
She will drop level appropriate gear. 
---
However, if you‚Äôre at max scrip, you might as well spend some. I spend about 100-150 a day there even when there aren‚Äôt sales. 
---
You‚Äôll get more scrip and there will be other sales in the future. But a decent legendary drop could make that grind a lot faster/easier.
---
Yes.
---
You can definitely do the main quest lines and a lot of the side stuff solo, but it‚Äôs not nearly so rich a solo experience as Fallout 4.
---
I started out looking for a solo experience, and still spend most of my time in game solo, but there is a lot of content that benefits from playing with a group.
---
I‚Äôve spent maybe 1000 hours in game (not counting the Nuclear Winter battle royale mode). Maybe 100 of that was main quest and side quests ‚Äî the rest was split among special events, grinding levels, and running around with friends in game. The special events (Fasnacht, Meat Week, Halloween) have been a lot of fun to do with a group.
---
Thank you very, very much! I really appreciate the giveaway!
---
Hi! Looks like you got 2nd. Do you want a Mothman postcard? If so, please DM your address. I‚Äôll send you the postcard blank so you can send it to whomever you like!
---
Pretty much to the final boss, who you could solo if you had a great build and gear.
---
He‚Äôs 1/4 chub ok...
---
Nobody will know until after the 31st
---
Change the name you have up; that is the name of one of the hackers that are causing all of this in the first place that you are trying to call out to and support. Last thing we want is to help the people doing all of this; I believe Black+Cat was the correct name.
---
They will remain unopened...
---
But seriously.  You wont lose your loot because the event ended.
---
The Atom Store.
---
Okay cool
---
What kind of stuff?
---
These are great ideas! Very specific and I completely agree
---
I'm sure this hacking shit will end up perma banning mods for most games in the future as well as anything external.
---
Everyone else will have to pay for the actions of a few assholes same as always.
---
It'll probably end up ruining crossplay features as well because really who's going to play with pc gamers with this hacking popping up across so many games.
---
Random pick ups off the ground like 10mils, shotguns, rifles, that kind of stuff
---
Goodbye funding for future content then lol
---
Hey, pls let me know if you launch another
---
You could just make a post here asking for people to help you
---
This might not be the case. I got the first two rewards, and then stopped playing for a week while the hacking fiasco was going on. I logged in yesterday, and my challenges are also only working on the outfit. 
---
Nobody has given me a beanie though.
---
 What's the main quest? Says a guy with 800+ hours. ;)
---
Easiest scam in Todd's life
---
I haven‚Äôt had any issues, mines always instant but I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
All of it up to the point you realise it‚Äôs way more fun to make friends
---
Yep... And they should've made scorched brutes spawn for the holiday too. like super mutant sized holiday scorched.
---
The main quest is the overseer quest and that one isn‚Äôt finished yet.
---
We can still server hop? I thought they nerfed that......
---
 I changed mine from a monthly to a yearly, and it kicked in fine.
---
Basically 1 min walk west of v76.  It‚Äôs still there.  There is an archery target and hole and another entrance to the cave down the hill on the west side.  No yao guai.   I have a char that lives in that cave.
---
What kid?
---
 Exactly. ;) I just build characters and quests matter for XP. Apart from that I don't actually pay much attention to them.
---
Awesome! Thank you.  Add me, and keep an eye out for the kid, hopefully we can direct him here.
---
That's awesome, thanks man. I think we have the kid's name now.
---
managing to launch a nuke at level 30 while a new player is actually a bit impressive. the only thing you are doing "wrong" is reaching far beyond your characters capabilities currently.  you havent figured out your playstyle or favorite weapon type yet, you havent Identified things in the game to build your character towards and away from. so of course your perk cards are jacked. example I hate cooking and micromanaging all the meats and getting the boiled water etc so I am drinking nuka colas and using good boy perk. previously I ran herbivore mutation and ate melons for one click food and water without cooking. the good news is you can always swap your perks if you invest badly, this means you dont have to worry about making mistakes. I would say untill you have a specific weapon chosen and maxed out you are far better off adjusting your main character rather than restarting. 
---
just take a step back. something I do when leveling alts is push forward till enemies get difficult then I stay there untill I run out of resources. then I just retrace the leveling route from the vault to rebuild resources again for another push. just keep at it you will smash through. 
---
I would say at level 30 to 50 is probably some of the highest difficulty part of the game. you are starting to run into higher level characters without the proper gear to put them down. its a rough hump to get past. just become the tide. retreat build up and surge forward rinse repeat untill you break that wall. once past that the difficulty begins scaling ever downwards  from that point.
---
Awesome! Will add you soon.
---
Well you have to use the force....of course....
---
Hatchet, bladed pickaxe and multipurpose axe.
---
There's also a tire iron axe but Idk if it counts as one because it's a mod
---
There's also tomahawk for style
---
It's not there. It goes from sleeping bag, to mattress, to pioneer scout skin (locked) and that's the only 3 things I have.
---
And people wonder why the game crashes?!
---
get off this subreddit and avoid you tube, play the game as presented to you and only come here or you tube when you really have to have specific info. after you get into the end game and high level and find yourself getting bored and or needing guidance come back then.
---
 Exactly, not a keeper. I used to sell em' to the Bots, and you could often find them there as well.
---
I suggest checking out captain noob on youtube and some of his build videos. Creating a good build for you will seriously help with your damage output
---
You'll get a better answer on the market sub, but a QFFR tesla is worth a bunch. Like, more caps than one character can hold.
---
It‚Äôs not clear from your post hour long it‚Äôs been, whether you‚Äôve been charged or when etc so it‚Äôs very hard to tell if it‚Äôs unusual
---
Well this video has blown up lmao, I'm one of the "hacker's" friends in that video, and while I could give Black+Crybaby his Jester mask back, it makes for quite a nice trophy. Besides, he did just straight up drop it on the ground after all. BTW, not sure where all these haccusations came from. He willingly set his items for 0 caps in a trade menu... pretty fair trade if you ask me.
---
Since I haven‚Äôt physically seen the videos, and ‚Äúwitch hunting‚Äù is a thing, would I be far off to guess that the hackers ign is anything close to BodegaTehAdolescent?
---
It has nothing to do with server stability
---
More importantly what happens if you don‚Äôt take down Christmas tree!! Oops i mean HOLIDAY tree
---
Well I‚Äôve never had an issue ps4 when did they change it?
---
It sounds like you‚Äôre looking into the whole thing a bit much, IMO. I like conspiracy theories as much as the next guy but I‚Äôd be surprised to find out any of the scenarios you‚Äôre trying to ‚Äúrule out‚Äù are even partially true. It‚Äôs very implausible and I‚Äôd say even a bit delusional to consider one of Bethesda‚Äôs competitors being behind this, considering Fallout 76 isn‚Äôt even close to being a competitor to anything. I mean just look at The Outer Worlds, it seems to me like Bethesda came out with that stupid 100$ subscription just so they could stay in the competition.
---
Honestly I‚Äôd put my money on the guy just being a bored hacker wanting to cause a bunch of outrage, which he‚Äôs definitely been successful doing. I‚Äôd just leave all the conspiracy theorizing to sites like infowars.
---
Looks like Sydney in Bush fire smoke
---
the highest weight to value ratio I have found so far has been mutation serums. they are my savings account. on short days when I have to work I can go to all my alts and just get vendor cap on all 5 characters in 15 minutes. I probably have 100 K in serums stored throughout my account.
---
 The Tomahawk is a throwing weapon, the best one. ;)
---
If you like rifles, I always suggest faster fire rate with a hairtrigger receiver. Fire rates not too bad on them
---
I do this but it doesn‚Äôt keep up with my needs. Between my ultracite Gatling and PA I‚Äôll get through much more than 3 in the time it takes for the machine to max out at 3 cores. 
---
Quite literally getting through them like candy. 
---
I did start doing map runs to all PA locations but where they used to be full they now have no more than 10% usually and that‚Äôs annoying with a Gatling.
---
It does this for me every time I try to assign an item from my stash after I've already assigned another item from stash. I have to exit the vending machine and re-enter in order to continue selling. So if I have all my items that I want to sell already in my stash, I would have to back out and re-enter the vending machine for each one I want to assign. It's very annoying, and time consuming, and scrolling through stash anyway is already slow and stuttery. Assigning from my inventory seems to have no issue.
---
So true.  You can work out if you will win or not within the didst two kills. Pvp is so inconsistent it should only be used in this game for fun
---
So I guess to clarify the fireman axe and hatchets would be baller. Are there Legendary hatchets? Lol
---
My month to month elapsed on 12/22 and I did a new order for fallout 1st on xmas eve around 4 am or so. I got the invoice and confirmation and everything it just hasn't been activated for whatever reason. The guy I talked to said they were investigating these issues he just told me I needed to await email communication from whatever department that does fallout 1st. But it is the holidays sort of still. I'm not sure if I should wait until after new years to reach out again
---
Amen brother
---
The BoS did kill a Queen and they thought they‚Äôd finished off the scorched but they came back again.
---
For comparison, killing a queen in a beehive doesn‚Äôt stop them, another queen will always eventually take the previous queens place.
---
I got his clown costume tho
---
EDIT: That's why in the second half of the video the kid is just wearing a BOS underamor for anyone who's wondering
---
Its gets easier once you have your build fleshed out and a one shot primary, like an instigating lever action.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Instigating lever action, calibrated receiver, aligned stock, aligned barrel, circle/dot reflex, suppressor. you'll one tap everything up to level 68 super mutants.
---
I started as a Sneak/Crit/VATS pistol, moved to rifle, then to commando. I use basically any VATS capable weapon now, and only pull out my handmade &amp; fixer for SBQ fights. I don't think I've crafted ammo in 3 months? I loot more then enough 10mm, .45, 5.56, and shotgun shells then i'll ever need and pump them through full auto weapons.
---
What a nice community.
---
If the person was a hacker you at least have to admit that the username is genius.
---
Yes you did
---
its also a potential hack if they reduce the draw range of structures  intentionally just to be able to do that. its why I quit pvp. well it was the final straw that made me leave pvp. the guy attacked my shop I was defending and he just ran away right through the walls of monongah power plant. he farmed me for a bit popping in and out of the walls. that was my last defense attempt. 76 does a lot of things right but the pvp and hacking in this game is hot garbage.
---
Kids are dumb and alot more trusting than you‚Äôre average adult, he lacks experience and you guys took advantage of that.
---
You should be beyond ashamed of yourselves.
---
I don‚Äôt know I didn‚Äôt mind the 3* he dropped ü§îüòÖ
---
caaaaAARDBOOAAARRRDD!
---
And you know this because you‚Äôre a dev, or is it just blind faith that glitching through walls surely can‚Äôt possibly be a problem.  People say this with absolutely zero evidence.  It‚Äôs definitely not intended, but for some reason, some people are so sure it can‚Äôt possibly cause problems. Utterly baffles me.
---
Had this in the big today while doing belly of the beast on the way to the cavern. Annoying.
---
You say moved to rifle and commando. Are those non vats?
---
Four. Fucking. Times. And I‚Äôm probably like 3 years older than him. There is 0 excuse for what happened.
---
Yep that sounds like a wait 2 weeks type scenario to me :(
---
I hear people say it causes issues with server instability, again with zero proof. My camp has been underground for over eight months and I‚Äôve never had any issues. When I have several friends with underground camps in the same server, also not a single issue.
---
So please, show me one shred of evidence that they lead to server instability?
---
Yes, if you read them they should disappear. If you pick up another it'll say (known) in front of it.
---
True facts
---
Yeah, I think thats what im going to do. Its just one of those odd times of a year. Thank you guys.

If they affected my stash, my life would be so much better
---
It wasn‚Äôt free- it was a promotional bundle for atoms + the battle coat.
---
Lots of screws there.
---
Yes sir
---
Not sure why anyone wouldn‚Äôt have five characters. With the caps, scrip, and weight limits. Even if you create a mule and park it at a train station. Every once and a while get a friend to help you move some stuff over. I have five characters all max caps, max scrip, and at least 25k 5.56 ammo. Funny thing is, I rarely play my main rifleman character any more (level 190) because my bloodied (level 104) is more fun....
---
Actually it does. Because it's the Bethesda Fallout interpretation of these folklore creatures. Not a literal representation.
---
Take the Mothman for example. It's supposed to be a sort of part moth part man hybrid. In 76 it's just a giant moth. It has zero human features. That's closer to Mothra than a Mothman.
---
Is that all you can do? Insult people?
---
Servers crash, we know that. People do dumb things that hack the intended game play.  Onus is on YOU to convince the rest of us that it‚Äôs not irresponsible, and you can‚Äôt.
---
Your right, you have 0 excuses for what you did
---
Go into the atom shop, pick up the santatron and the terminal. (They're free)
---
Place a camp and build both (you'll need to scavenge mats for them.)
---
The Santa will give gifts as well as mats. Collect them regularly and place them in your stash. Fast travel is free to your camp. 
---
Go to Morgantown airport just north of the center of the map. Farm the legendary scorched Xmas event until it ends on the 31st. It'll get you rare plans and legendary loot. 
---
Then start the tadpole quest (North pf the Grafton dam) and the camera quest (mysterious stranger on terminal) don't focus on them. You'll complete them through your normal story progression.
---
Edit: I should've said you can complete the tadpole and camera quests along side the normal quests. You will have to actively perform the objectives but the main quest will take you to those same locations.
---
Ok internet, that‚Äôs enough for today.
---
Well damn I wish i was online. Work always cucks me with deals and fun.
---
I thought they said they failed and v9 was the drop point I only bring this point up cause of the relay in the glassed caverns
---
From in-game clues and hints, it's suggested to be created from humans that feed off of irradiated human flesh for long periods. When said human mutates into a Ghoul, it becomes a different type of ghoul, a Wendigo.
---
One issue with this theory though, Ghouls can't become Scorched, the Scorched plague doesn't affect them. Yet Wendigos can become Scorched. If Wendigos are just a variation of Ghoul, how is this possible?
---
Weather or not the fo76 has a future depends on Bethesda. They can add as much content as they want, but if they dont fix issues they are having, as well as help those impacted by ot, then i think this game will be all but dead in another year.
---
But, the game had potential, and if Bethesda can pull their heads out of their asses, there fingers out of their ears and the wool from their eyes, it could become something great.
---
Looking through the rest of this subreddit, and the internet as a whole, will reveal alot of hate for this game and Bethesda, and its not unfounded, and about half of it is deserved, BUT much of it is just trolls taking it and running with it.
---
You've already payed for the game, take time to form your own opinions, and change them constantly (i know i did). And good luck with it.
---
Using your logic I can say that travelling to an event, exiting out, and travelling back to get rid of the trade glitch causes server instability. You‚Äôre doing it to get around something that the game intended. Oh, prove me that I‚Äôm wrong?
---
Your argument makes no sense. You make an accusation with zero proof, and then ask me to prove you wrong. I‚Äôm telling you that from personal experience I‚Äôve had zero issues with server stability, after over 300 levels in the game.
---
Agreed it‚Äôs definitely more fun to be able to switch up and play multiple chars with different setups.  It also insures you against your favourite build getting nerfed.. you just swap to another good one
---
I have the best raider power armor.
---
He obviously never had the pleasure of being scammed before then.
---
And not every kid knows how shitty people can be at that age, like I said before kids are alot more trusting, some more than others, taking advantage of that is just pathetic.
---
Honestly I give Bethesda a lot of credit for not just bailing on this game after over a year of non stop hate and bs and they're still trying despite every thing stacked against them.
---
Are they great at programming not really. Are they good at marketing hell no.
---
At that they do make really good worlds especially for exploring type players and looter type players.
---
I never blamed them for trying something new but they messed up by calling it fallout 76 because it's a survival spin off. They should've tried something like The Wasteland Survival Guide instead and not even have mentioned fallout.
---
That probably would have halved the hate.
---
I‚Äôd start with Stabilized perk..
---
Sadly this would be a texture everybody within the view range would have to download, and that means lag so not gonna happen
---
Fast travelling isn‚Äôt blatantly screwing with the physics engine sorry you‚Äôre exactly the kind of person I was talking about that just has no idea why they think it‚Äôs okay.  
---
If you‚Äôre telling me you had no server instability in over 300 levels I‚Äôm telling you you‚Äôre not playing fallout 76. And when it does crash you have no idea what caused it so no idea if it was your camp.  Yet you go on believing that you can do what you want because you can and it can‚Äôt possibly possibly cause an issue.  
---
End of conversation, next time the server crashes I‚Äôll just think another one of those fools who built a place underground probably and yet doesn‚Äôt believe it could possibly cause an issue
---
Maybe not. The map on the pip boy would not look as nice or be that appealing as the paper map is. I don‚Äôt like to have to wait for the map to show up, but it is nicer than the map on the pip boy can be
---
You literally deserve to be insulted and called out if you call a rape survivor story cringe or do you disagree? Your mindset also deserves insulting.
---
You still online? I‚Äôll drop by if you still have stuff and are still online
---
If they're not legendary you might as well just scrap them and stash the junk.
---
Dammit
---
My stash is full and I don't need the scrap from weapons
---
Yea I'm online
---
Yea... When I now see people who have these stupid glitched camps that go under the map or into walls, I no longer even attempt to visit their venders and just block them. I really don't find them 'cool' and are more of a harassment than anything else (If said person logs out or removes the floor under your, your screwed. Only a relog will get you back, i am not even sure if u actually ever 'fall')
---
So take that into consideration.
---
i mean i feel bad for the kid, but come on this is all on Bethesda, like i still remember the stupid line of Todd on E3 when he said "we want to see what player do to each other" and good lord what you can expect. 
---
Is like they ignore 20 years of other live services games out there that have face this problems or similar, they ignore everything. 
---
This dude should have been ban and since there is actual proof Bethesda should have give this kid they stuff back, for me this show how little ability Bugthesda have to handle this type of game. Like i said in other post you have this issue on WoW you can contact them, on game on phone or on mail, and you will get your stuff back on 24hs, it happen to me back on 2010 and they fix it and make me add a authentication and helping me doing that.
---
Yeah it does, I have 4 pieces and my DR is 400 something
---
You sick fuck
---
that would be him
---
That would be fantastic. I was thinking about a toggle on/off in options but this is better.
---
Maybe this could be a toggle.
---
Pause --&gt; Settings --&gt; Game --&gt; CAMP/Workshop Build mode Choices are Classic (as it is now) Enhanced (No intersects existing object/item is floating/ etc), or No Snapping (be like classic expect auto snapping for some pieces is disabled and Enhanced No Snapping (same as the other one expect it uses the Enhanced build mode instead of classic.
---
I bet if Bethesda puts a monitor on this and they see how many people switch on Enhanced Build mode they will get rid of Classic soon.
---
What??
---
No love for snipers...
---
I have fallen through my base many times with 0 issue as well as my friends. We just built one at site Charlie for watching the nukes get launched. That said, I leave my vendors outside for people who can stand to wear power armor.
---
So you're BodegaTheKid, the same person that was part of the 500 plus hacking thefts last week?
---
Food build much?
---
It's why everyone who isnt bloodied and wanting Unyielding,  is high health and wants vanguards
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the beta, and I had FAR more server crashes in the first 100 levels before I put my camp underground. Now, they pretty much never happen to me anymore. I guess underground camps probably have a protective effect, lol
---
Beware, they can read your thoughts while you are glowing!
---
Haha I sell most of my plans for low prices. Idk how much they are worth and all I know is I don't need it lol. üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm running a heavy guns Strangler PA nuka spam build if you want it, though it‚Äôs more PvP centered
---
Anytime ive had to deal with him, I was in the Mire. Always dark and spooky, then *WHOOSH* here he comes to kick my ass while I'm encumbered.
---
Aw no autoaxe, bottlecap mine, nailgun, sawblade launcher, or compound bow?
---
You forgot the "i"
---
Maybe on pc. But with a controller, it's hard as hell to hit someone jumping around with frog legs. They get pretty insane in-air mobility.
---
Then if they're using the noob-tube, they don't even have to aim and they don't have to worry about hurting themselves because of the exploit.
---
Not free, but on that note, I hope Bethesda brings back those monthly atom bonus bundles.
---
Dogwood and death blossoms for sure.
---
Woah woah woah so if i bought that SAH and then i got a sick legendary one i wouldnt be able to make it a sheepsquatch head one?
---
I don't think it was a slow load. Guy was going in and out, and flying in the air, for about 20 minutes.
---
I don't need someone going through my underwear drawer.
---
I just did this recently, had my main stealth commando but wanted to do a heavy pa build. I started a new character during the 2x do event and had him up to 50 by the end of it.
---
Hey everyone,
---
I have two lol. 150+ characters. I'm down to play or help out if any of your quests. Usually on most days after 1pm CST
---
GT: CapAm40
---
Yep and you can put an electro mod on it
---
Yup, the only "hate" I have for this game is. The sheer bugginess and how Bethesda has chosen to handle this game, and I don't think I would even call it hate, more disappointment because I feel this game could be such an amazing game if it weren't for its major issues
---
This was over the course of 20 minutes. Plus he was flying and floating above the base.
---
1. head shots
---
2. any perk or weapon that gives anti-armor
---
3. Prime your weapon
---
4. get a zealot weapon - ideally a zealot AA weapon, then prime it...if you can find one that does limb damage as well and you go for the wings you're golden
---
In my experience the highest DPS weapons that do damage on the SBQ are plasma gatlings, 50 cal, LMG - idealy any of the proceeding should conform to #4
---
Kidding! Thanks for the answer :)
---
Correct
---
&gt;I don't know much about this stuff, but surely someone capable of figuring out how to hack like this could get around a hardware ban or use another machine?
---
DING DING DING, BINGO!
---
People spoof their HWID all the time to bypass things like battleye!
---
Bethesda should take to extreme methods for hackers, script kiddies, and cheaters.
---
Here's my take on it
---
1. Bethesda HWID bans, takes ALL of their items, then gives it away to the community for free.
---
2. Bethesda then bans their accounts from their client (basically not letting them be able to play online games ever again on the Bestheda client, but can buy their games still using that account.) and blacklists their IP, so any accounts on said IP becomes banned automatically.
---
Bethesda can think up more than just this too, the crueler the punishment, the better.
---
Edit: also I was late to this, as people already also voiced the same thing about HWID bans and how useless they are.
---
pshhhhh.
---
Im level 97 with a full suit of ultracite and I could barely survive my last sbq event with it and a vampires gatling laser.
---
No, you can pretty obviously find out which one I am.
---
good lord ppl downvote you back you blame Bethesda and that is the key issue, this ppl dont care how shitty Bethesda is on ever step. they will blindly keep eating their shit. 
---
Bethesda is 100% on fault here, other live service from big companies like Bethesda, aka blizzard or Activision or hell Fornite, they compensate you in 1 or less of a day if you get hack and rob and you have proff and worst if you have this clear dude with a name adding publicity to his crime. 
---
Bethesda at this point show how little control they have over this issues.
---
No. Fallout 1st only emote.
---
LOL, this wasn‚Äôt days, this was minutes after he gets scammed and he immediately trusts me enough to put his item up first.
---
I do use vats and have Concentrated Fire at 3 now.  I just dinged 24 and put a point into Marksman and it seems to help some already.  I only have a level 10 marksman rifle now though so I need to find something new.
---
Try seeing it from this perspective: 
---
I‚Äôd been defending why I kept faith in and was still playing the game to a friend of mine (he quit after getting fed up with the inferior storage space in the stash box) since before launch, then he messages me on discord one day and I hear that Bethesda released not just private servers, but several other very much wanted features I‚Äôd been expecting to be implemented since the game released... and put them all behind a subscription based paywall. I was one of the people who bought the game for the full $60 at launch and then I find out all the features I‚Äôd been expecting were being marketed to me for $100. Try understanding for a second how that might‚Äôve felt.
---
Most of the people criticizing the game are doing so BECAUSE they liked the game. I personally hope Bethesda eventually ends up deciding to go in a different direction by removing their current p2w and paywall mechanics, but it seems like almost every time Bethesda releases an update it‚Äôs just another disappointment.
---
Not the dance.....the crosshairs and the ‚Äò inspect‚Äô option
---
Folks already answered you, so little tidbit to add...
---
Ensure you consider both the Grounded and Scaly Skin mutations if you're concerned with DR/ER. Assuming class freak, both mutations will collectively add 50DR and 150ER for the cost of 12 AP and 12% energy gun damage reduction. Strange in numbers stacks it even higher (62DR/187ER)
---
Literally zero people knew this until I told them. You‚Äôre welcome.
---
Ah, my apologies. Yeah, that is odd. I can't recall ever seeing that option.
---
My other team mate gave me the ‚Äòcommand‚Äô option
---
Why would you even drag a rape survivor story into something about a video game???
---
I have Scaly Skin but have been hesitant with Grounded - ED just seems like not that much of a problem at all...?
---
Same thing happened to some 70 year old guy and I gave him a bunch of stuff
---
Litterally any gamma will do the same rads
---
Yeah.. some kids are more trusting like that, there are kids out there who will trust you again even if you break their trust. 
---
This kid obviously hasn‚Äôt met a bad person he couldn‚Äôt trust until you and your friends showed up.
---
Real talk tho, why would you go out of your way to ruin someone else‚Äôs day in the first place?
---
Put yourself in his shoes, what if someone decided to come take your shit for no reason, just for a ‚Äúlaugh‚Äù or because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfunny‚Äù
---
Junkies and bloodied both do +50% extra damage no matter what
---
I was just looking at that too. "Command" sounds like companion talk and, if I remember right, we're supposed to get a limited companion mechanic with Wastelanders. 
---
Still don't know what to make of "inspect" though.
---
People literally get paid by companies to do what you just said, it‚Äôs called penetration testing... It sounds like you know nothing about information technology or cyber security. 
---
Oh and ill let you in on a secret:
---
the World Wide Web isn‚Äôt a giant spider‚Äôs web
---
Now quit talking about things you know nothing about.
---
Nice, whats his username? I can help out as well.
---
PC vulnerability is NOT solved. Found a guy last night with an SBQ pet. It seemed like he could control it to some degree.
---
The quick story is that I dropped into his camp to check out his vending machines. He shot me with a syringer. How rude! lol Anyway, I ran off after seeing his SBQ pet and he looted my bag after I died (I didn't have much). It was right around The Vantage. So I respawned and chased him down as he was heading towards Whitesprings. Shot him in the head to get his attention (non PvP, I stay passive). He tried to chase me down with his SBQ carpet bombing the area he thought I was in. I found it odd since there were no enemies there. I took some screenshots to report and exited the game.
---
The game is still not safe.
---
Possibly companions will have storage? Just curious why it glitched into the game early maybe?
---
well Todd just got another sheep for his sheep farm so he is happy.
---
Peace60 I also found the video of the people doing it to him so you know I'm not just making it up. I'll dm you it
---
Supposedly it was staged.  Many remarked how phony the kid sounded.
---
Killer.
---
Well fuck that thanks for your post dude
---
It's a personal thing, I suppose. I swap between my lever action and my handmade, so there was no drawback to getting Grounded. Plenty of enemies inflict some form of energy damage, though ballistic is admittedly far more common
---
Now we just need this but for every plan in the game
---
Can we have the christmas NW challenges come back because noones got time for that this time of year
---
You know what - fuck energy weapons, I fight unarmed or with my lever 95% of the time anytime. I‚Äôm getting Grounded good sir!
---
The kid's IGN is Black+Cat, let me know if you are able to get in touch with him.
---
Awesome, will reach out to him tomorrow.
---
I have no clue as to why any of the glitches happen other than "because Bethesda".
---
I don't care about 'hackers doing x, y, or z' it's too minimal to ever effect the majority of the community.
---
Best practice is: Quietly capture footage, report it, and let them get removed from the community. They don't deserve the publicity they are getting.
---
Point me in that direction? Because I agree!
---
Player vendors. At least for a while. I'm broke AF.
---
Nicely done. Have to get those resort
---
Cloth chairs now
---
Nah
---
That's fucking awesome, loved the way you talked about it.
---
Refund
---
Autoaxe would make sense considering WV is basically a mining state. Bottlecap mine I guess wouldn't make sense considering it'd been only 25 years since the bombs drop, thought the exact date when the bottlecap mine was made isn't certain. The nail gun and the needler pistol I put in the same category since they're both small weapons that fire projectiles. A sawblade launcher is cool, and sounds perfect as a Raider weapon. A compound bow feels more like a special mod made for the normal bow to me, but I can imagine it being implimented as its own unique weapon
---
Best part is when the game spawns you in the nuked zone and you don't use PA.
---
I'm on PS4 though...hmmm...another mystery.
---
Just wait a month and they will be everywhere, for super cheap.
---
Aw, don't worry. I'm sure sniper lovers will get their love soon. I can imagine them adding back the Fallout 3/NV sniper rifle back in as a special semi auto sniper. The varmint rifle could be good as a poor man's sniper, and I'd be hella excited if they added the AMR in as well.
---
Yeah I spent a lot of time on a camp across a river gorge by one of the silo sites that ended up having one step of a quest plop down in the middle of it making my home no longer viable.  Was quite a bummer.
---
I thought that one sounded a little fake as well
---
I wouldn‚Äôt give them my shit, ez
---
I'm glad that you didn't actually lose them and found them in the build menu. You won't see it in the notes section of Pip-Boy again unless you find a duplicate. The notes section isn't a record of "known" plans, it's literally the physical plans that you are carrying (.25 weight a piece) that you either haven't learned already (will be like "PLAN/RECIPE:") or have already learned (will be like (KNOWN)PLAN/RECIPE:").  
---
So TLDR: the plans that you see in your Pip-Boy that say "(KNOWN)" are duplicates that are taking up your inventory space. You should sell (or drop if they're worthless) any KNOWN plans to help save space.
---
Eh, I don't die all that much.  Having that low health evasion perk helps a lot.
---
That'd be awesome
---
Black cat is banned here and I know him he doesn't need help
---
Go on..
---
I asked for **better** and for **non-Bloodied builds**. 
---
Junkie‚Äôs isn‚Äôt better than Executioner‚Äôs in the scenario I described. 
---
And Bloodied literally isn‚Äôt **non-Bloodied**. 
---
And you can spam all the Quantum you want; that won‚Äôt fix the Rad damage. Hell, it‚Äôll just speed up your demise.
---
I'm somewhat salty that I found out Portable Power was changed, cause it used to affect power armor chassis inside your stash, but now it seems to calculate them as full weight.  I miss the way it was.
---
Are you on PS4? I made a military checkpoint like base with the same thing in mind, and really like how it turned out. Could show you, or maybe send some pics if you like.
---
It‚Äôs nice to see others on here who aren‚Äôt just die hard fans defending every bad decision Bethesda‚Äôs made with 76. I also enjoyed the game and had a lot of fun, but quit playing after all the constant grinding just felt gratuitous.
---
Finding out they monetized a bunch of features I‚Äôd been expecting them to implement since launch with a subsection based service was especially disappointing. Just hoping they‚Äôll take that out someday or at least limit the scope of the subscription to personal servers.
---
Map76.com and search mothman.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, I would like some pictures though if you don‚Äôt mind.
---
People are paying 100c for fusion cores?? I usually sell full ones for like 25 since I'd just end up dumping them in a bag somewhere in the wastes otherwise.
---
This is the christmas present kim Jong ill promised us!  I just figured that out this instant.
---
Was this on ps4?
---
You can adapt a Bloodied build to work with Power Armor, but it's a necessity to run Emergency Protcols in the PA chest.  The rest is just preference really.
---
Thats why I always have a hazmat suit with me.
---
there are tricks. it just takes time to get to know the quirks. a farm on golf course right by numerous enemy spawns tho....??? and there are some flat areas on the map. just gotta find em.
---
The ‚Äú400 rounds per minute‚Äù label on Gatling guns is a mistake. It‚Äôs been mislabeled since beta last year, and Bethesda hasn‚Äôt gotten around to correcting it.
---
They're like a hybrid between a hunting rifle and a 50cal. A bit less than half the damage of a rifle, with much faster ROF, and less than half the ROF of a 50cal, but much more damage. They're also pretty forgiving for VATS, you can get 4-6 shots off and the cross can hit hard. 
---
I carry 2, the bloodied faster fire is great for random crap, and a zealots explosive for scorched areas.
---
You get the flux from nuke zones harvest flower inside the area then you have to stabilise it
---
From the sheepsquatch event
---
So you just have to keep doing the event and hope you get the mod for the weapon you want? Damn
---
Yes. Occasionally you can find then in player vendors for 1-2k a piece
---
They only have one mod for each one
---
It's a high-end item.  Not really something that a player can offer until they have consistent access to nuke zone materials.  Most players also keep it out of reach of regular spawns or even non-friend-listed visitors, because repairing it is costly.
---
They are allegedly adding the secret nuka cola machine door to the game so that might be decent, have a normal side and a safe house hidden by door.
---
A 25 fire rate with a speedy reciever are pretty quick
---
????
---
If you do the event at that lighthouse it'll summon the wise mothman, he won't attack you he'll just spread his infinite wisdom to you
---
All that attacks me as of right now is some scorched and bloodbugs, but my turrets handle them pretty good. I haven't come across any decent flatlands suitable for a farm area that we can build on.
---
Thank you stranger. You deserve some kind of prize for this.
---
Edit: I just noticed it wasn‚Äôt you, but still, thanks a lot for sharing. Don‚Äôt let us forget this compilation exists
---
It does not. Ignore him. You get 1 XP every 4 seconds survived no matter what. It is not randomized, you just did *something* to tip the XP over.
---
Feral turrets, they went mad with radiation and bad paint jobs.  They just want to be stuck to the wall of your base.
---
Oh THAT'S why!!
---
You can get the flux from player vendors for between 100 and 200 caps (sometimes less).  If you store it and place it back out, that should repair it, but if it gets destroyed it will be a little spendy to fix.
---
You can play it safe and just keep it stored when you don't need it, but once you're been playing a bit, the cost or and access to the flux won't be much of a problem.
---
And on top of that, being a bloodied build
---
ü§Æ
---
Bugthesda.
---
Store the turrets and put them back out, that will reset them (and repair them).
---
I don‚Äôt play PVP so we‚Äôre cool lol
---
Server crash
---
While it'd be cool, I imagine having it directly display ingame would mean all pictures need to be uploaded to the serve, which'd take space and would slow things down significantly.
---
What could work though is having a blank painting frame, which when you activate will access someone's image and have it display on your screen. That'd kind of be a moot point though, as that defeats the purpose of a painting.
---
I dont have all the numbers but depends on your build. I love unyielding for the stats, and the power it gives me, I can kill everything quickly. Bolstering i think is low health but unyielding i like more than that. If van is high health,  it works really well with junkie builds. I'd say pass on exterm except for vault raids and trouble for imposter sheep. But those are all situational. You'll take damage from so many things not just bugs or robots,  so having overall DR is better. Trouble/Exterm wont do anything vs ghouls scorched mutants etc.
---
Oh your good then.
---
It‚Äôs probably 1.5 shots per second, so 90/minute. You can definitely shoot a non automatic rifle faster than a Gatling gun.
---
At the same time, a Gatling gun could be a great heavy gun choice, especially if you want to conserve ammo. You get all the perks of heavy gun builds without draining 3k ammo each time you raid a dungeon. The downside is that if you have multiple enemies, you‚Äôre really vulnerable. So that takes bloodied out of the picture.
---
It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúcarpet bomb‚Äù weapon like the 50 cal or 308 machine gun. In fact, it‚Äôs a pretty demanding gun, and you‚Äôve got to be able to aim well, usually right in the middle of combat. Some people can do it well, but I suck at it.
---
I think Project Beanstalk is part of the base game. I did it in 2018 for sure
---
I used to play another game where a handful of us spent a lot of our time writing code to help us with the game. There were basically two sides against each other, and each side had their coders who built tools.
---
We did a lot. Calculations about when certain events would trigger to give us an edge, tracking player movements to alert us if some one noteworthy was on the move. I even wrote a Chrome extension to assign common game actions to keystrokes to shave a few seconds off of the common head-to-head stuff. I put a lot of hours into code to get more out of that game than the game itself provided.
---
The point is, you are absolutely correct. Just doing something new is motivation for a lot of programmers and seeing your tools serve their purpose is gratifying. Some people who do this are also trolls though, and it's really fun for them to build stuff that wrecks something for someone else. They don't have money on their mind and they're not even that interested in the thing they're stealing.
---
I main a gatling now. speedy receiver mod will let you up the speed a tad with 0 downsides. but its still slow. but it hits hard. and the ammo is super light weight. the reason its my main gun now is because If i run a silo and then go fight the queen I pick up enough loot to not only cover the ammo cost of the entire process but actually get a little ahead.
---
I run no weight reduction points fopr the ammo and it weighs .001 pounds. this lets me put stre perks into blocker and bullet sheild which makes me very tanky and also reduces heals used.
---
I didnt like it at first untill I focused in on the ammo factors. it beats the .50 cal by a pretty good margin in ammo efficenciy.
---
now I have come to love the sound of the weapons as I methodicaly thump thump thump my way through enemies.
---
also I found replacing all 5 gunsmith perks with demo perks makes for one hell of a mean nuka grenade. combine that with grenadier and you can really breeze through the mainframe destruction room ewith only a few nuka grenades.
---
I get my ass kicked in PVP
---
Answer my question. Or are you gonna dodge it like a bitch? Do you think its cringe?
---
Was this at a workshop? Or did they return fire?
---
PvP is no skill now. Just who has the weapon that breaks the game and lags the enemy out
---
I built a secret entrance under a church once, it was unbelievably over complicated haha :) make sure you post some pictures! Sounds cool!
---
Killed a guy with a bounty and his friend decided to roll up on me
---
I know the feels. So what will u do now?
---
I honestly can't think of a good reason to retire any of the events. It seems like each one has its fans. I do tea time to get Sweetwater's Special Blend, I'm a food build
---
Already had this argument with somebody that went in circles.  Police, government, zetan aliens, w/e. 
---
I never said they are doing a great job, but that doesn't mean they are "squarely to blame".
---
Yea look at Fortnite, they had a glitch where you could clone items in the Save the world mode and after a few days of people doing it they deleted all the extra cloned items. . . oh wait folks at Epic Games actually know how to track and fix game bugs that involve inventory. Another favorite part of Fallout 76 battle royale is trying to place a turret down from a quick kit to lag spike for 5 seconds just so I could use and was playing on an Xbox X. It tells lot about a game when combat your FPS drop like a brick.
---
it never has been in this game. been playing since beta pvp was is and always has been gear based and not skill based.
---
Sell stuff. Make caps. And chill out with some music
---
Hey dude - do you mind not posting stupid shit.
---
I'm pretty sure there is a functional drink dispenser in the files. FormID 00575B69 is called "ATX\_workshop\_co\_Brewing\_NukaColaVendingMachine", and has the description "The Pristine Nuka-Cola Vending Machine is a container which can dispense bottled drinks in your C.A.M.P." There's a .nif file in Update 13 Main (patch 14) called "atx\_nukacolavendingmachine\_01.nif" that looks like a normal Nuka-Cola machine. There are some references to Nuclear Winter in the vending machine record, and I don't know what that's about. "atx\_" items are Atom Shop. Who knows what they'll do with it?
---
Then again, the vending machine record calls on the Punchbowl sound file, so maybe it's supposed to be a random dispenser like the bowl.
---
I know for certain messing with the physics engine in some other online games can knock over the simulator, it could be the same.  No one here is qualified to say it can‚Äôt so unless you‚Äôre willing to say there‚Äôs just no way, without being a Bethesda engineer, then it‚Äôs just irresponsible to hack, glitch, dupe or anything like it.
---
But be my guest, ask Bethesda and if they say it‚Äôs ok, brilliant.
---
Unfortunately this advice is a bit late because the event ends so, but still you should change the door to where you hide your santatron to a keypad door. This will truly make it inaccessible to  anyone but you
---
My game likes to crash when I buy a legendary from the proveyor
---
That actually just just crossed my mind.
---
If you're on PC I can hook you up with flux tomorrow.
---
Yup from fast travel spawn point it should be a bit to the right (North) on the island. That is after you swim across to the actual island mind you. Look for a large circle. Also the only place to find deathclaw eggs I think.
---
I dont use a collectron or santatron because of this.  Without them i just have to put up with normal problems like the turrets not attacking things that are actively eating them!!
---
I played through the whole main storyline solo. It wasn‚Äôt until I hit max level and done most of my to-do list that I started grouping up with players. That extended my enjoyment of the game because it was fun to go as a group and also to help complete their collections, etc. You can totally run through the game solo, though
---
It would be like printing money. Munitions Factory? meh. The real PvP is over fizzy drinks.
---
How do you know it was bloodied.. just saying
---
If you had a second pc or console running fo76 and they were teamed up on your server you bring up the map and you have a map showing your position on a second screen
---
No, you dont. 
---
Charisma affects event rewards
---
*Intelligence* affects XP in normal mode 
---
And i can assure you SPECIAL has no bearing on NW XP.
---
at which point he runs into the level 30 ish wall and comes back here to find out how to get past it. its not shitty advice its giving him a chance to figure things out on his own without having the answers thrown at him and spoiling the experience.
---
Serious, i charge 20 caps for those.
---
This is perfect advice.  Everyone on youtube wants views for posting their opinion on how shitty the game is.  I used to love juicehead videos.  Half the info in his videos is rumors or trash now.  Oh hey there is a 10 star legendary hack. No you didnt fact check anything and it was photoshopped by a troll.
---
Enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Intelligence doesny affect xp in normal mode. That was back in fo4
---
I consistently sell them for 1250 and they always sell within a day. You should charge more
---
Don‚Äôt forget you need those ingredients to rebuild it when a mole rat eats it too :(
---
Southwest of vault 76 is a hole/cave. You can build a small shack on top and use the cave as the hidden basement and armory.
---
One time I also put up a camp by lakeside cabins, there is like a small depression in the ground that i used as a hidden room for my camp.
---
You can also build on top of a tree for some extra building height. Helps with tall buildings if you want to do something with them.
---
Ohh i like the nuka grenade tip!!
---
Honestly spawning in the prydwen just seems like a harmless hack. Did it actually give anyone an unfair advantage?
---
I doubt they will with the sub, but it would be nice for nonsubscribers.
---
No that‚Äôs a different outfit. If you use the search function you should be able to find the datamine that shows the rewards and the images for the jacket.
---
Not fixed have to reload while crouched to not break primary effect on weapon,
---
I see, okay, thank you for this info!
---
&gt;Apparently there‚Äôs a script in the works that will remove your essential flag and basically mark you as an NPC and allow you to be permakilled.
---
I have a hard time believing that claim.
---
&gt;Plus Bodega is still running around somehow stealing inventories and he‚Äôs hit 309 people and he has a surprise for New Years Eve.
---
That, on the other hand, I find very believable.
---
They fixed it for a few days, but it broke armor, so they scrapped the fix. Specific legendary affects are still fine with it, but bloodied and similar where you have additive bonus damage based on a variable (as far as I can see) breaks.   
---
I have a instigating explosive with 250 DR while reloading and it's never had any problems.
---
It happens to me about once every 75 to 100 spawns at worst.  Shit happens.  /u/Thalenia gave the fix.
---
Thanks for the info, wondering if furious would work... ü§î
---
Nuke slightly off Whitesprings. A tad close to the train station. Tons of Flora and lots of glowing ones for the hardened masses and irradiated fluids.
---
it is ridiculous there is not.
---
Placement XP. How many people are left when you die affects a XP reward as well.
---
They would charge 1,000 atoms at least for such a  thing.  :(
---
Nah the beanie and winter uniform can be dropped
---
I've heard you can glitch through to Santatron with PA is this true?
---
Since you're doing an axe build, I'd sell you one of these for 2k caps: 
---
Fire Axe- Level 45 - +40% PA, +30% Damage Supermutant, 90% RW
---
Multi Purpose Axe- Level 45 - +40% FSS, +10% Damage Players, +1 Agility
---
Fire Axe- Level 45 - Reduce target damage 3s, +50% Reflect Melee Damage, +1 Endurance
---
You obviously know nothing about a nuka build if you claim you have to drink 30. You need literally one in most cases maybe a couple if someone‚Äôs good. Cute of you to assume I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to roll alone, it‚Äôs how I do a majority of my PvP lmao. I wiped out a squad of 4 a couple times earlier by myself AND with a bounty where they had the advantage
---
Still not making sense.
---
So ... let me get this straight.  You did a good deed...but are now pissed that you didn't get thanked enough?  I mean what would have it taken to make you feel better about this?  Hand wave?  Mention on some YouTube channel?  Virtual blow job????
---
Maybe good deeds are not so good ... when you expect anything at all in return.
---
they should pursue him legally fuck guys like that rationalizing shitty behavior as doing a service to the community.
---
also fuck anyone else who defends guys like that by saying it's Bethesda's fault. ( I mean it is to some extent ) hackers exists outside of Bethesda's property iPhone and Android OS and store gets hacked.. CoD, BF, Fortnite. it's not an excuse to be shitty for awareness ( I actually saw some people rationalize it like that if more people suffer then they will leave the game Bethesda suffer great losses HUGE WIN FOR GAMERS..... ffs)
---
I maybe mistaken but you start getting royalties after 1m views and you get really small amount of profit. I can't see some elaborate plot of hackers and youtubers against Bethesda.
---
Opposite answer to your question but I found Big Bend to be an easy one-shot per kill for xp during the double xp event. I know it‚Äôs not the most efficient xp farm but it‚Äôs a good casual xp farm.  So I‚Äôll probably return to it.
---
And the whole being invisible the whole time? I‚Äôll engage pacifist mode. Thanks. I was just chilling in my base.
---
I made a toon that wears the grognak costume and wields his axe that is an Instigating, Power Attack and +1 strength followed by an anti-armor, Swing Speed and +1 strength. For armor I got a full set of vanguard armor.
---
Could‚Äôve had stealthboys, the MK3s last a bit. Also could‚Äôve been chameleon.
---
I wouldn't mind hanging plants and bigger wind chimes. Maybe a windmill while they're at it too.
---
Ps.  How is Sanjay alerting me if he‚Äôs dead?
---
True, but I still don't think that would be enough
---
I don‚Äôt do a lot of pvp, but I still had fun. Think I‚Äôll try it out for myself. Griefing is kinda fun.
---
As we can't see current online player count it's subjective . my pool of 2 people i know play wont buy 1st . so from my perspective no one buys . anyways we all wait for the dlc to play again
---
Maybe I'm missing it but I don't see mention of him being invisible. But that means he had the chameleon mutation or a stealthboy.
---
But isn't the ammo-expended on both of those guns, like...  six times the Gatling's ammo-expended?
---
dude welcome to gaming subreddits. where every company and dev is evil and want exploit you and if you say otherwise your a heritic
---
Grognak axes are my favorite, I got a mutated, swing speed, reduced weight one myself, very fun.
---
At least that.  However I am talking Damage Per Second rather than overall efficiency - two different things there :)  I would never use a gatling on a glowing mob for example - can't kill them fast enough.  But the 50 cal action hero (or the LMG if i choose to use that) will cut them all down.
---
I use the Gatling to lay down damage on medium to longer range enemies. It's great for tagging far away ememies during an SBQ event. It's not too shabby at all for SBQs in the air either but once they hit the ground then I take out my Primed Zealot explosive LMG and lay it on her.
---
dude don't try to make him sound like the good guy in this..
---
Honestly, I'd enjoy it if they changed the Player's origin based on the time they began playing. Like what ESO did for the Morrowind release.
---
If you use Ironclad with barbarian/the other perk in AGI, with a good armor, % DR is better than more BR ER. Mutant Slayer/Troubleshooter is good because there are the main two ennemies who will use ranged weapons in endgame (not affected by blocker). You can use Zealot too.
---
If you don't want to adapt, then don't complain. You're like a poor person who complains about being poor, but doesn't get a job.
---
It doesn't get faster, but there's no spinup/spindown and you'll be one-hitting most things anyway. I use VATS all the time with mine and treat it like a rifle, plinking away one shot at a time until I need full auto fire. Speedy receiver, long barrel, and extra-large magazine turn it into a real beast that's still easy on ammo.
---
I still have tons of stuff to get rid of, I'll be getting off in about half an hour
---
I know it‚Äôs just a game but isn‚Äôt this considered terrorism? Lol
---
Zealot and AA are major prefixes. You can't have both on the same item.
---
I think he was pissed that the first player snatched it all and bolted, not letting the second player have anything....
---
I spent so many hours building up the different sections only to spend more hours trying to trick the crappy settler AI into not just having all my settlers milling around on top of the vault structures. Eventually I just gave up and built an above ground vault on Spectacle Island.
---
I don't know what to call it anymore... I thought the stealing shit was the only issue we had now, but reading through that forum gave me chills. I saw Bee Swarm weapons (yes, weapons firing multiple bee swarms), access to invisible terminals and containers, access to the Dev Room (they can still access it) between other stuff. I'm getting really scared for the future of this game.  
---
They're also saying there that Bethesda is rewarding players that lost their stuff on the last hack only 1000 atoms. I hope that's not true :/
---
All I can hear is "***18$ FOR BLUE!?!?!!!***"
---
Hahaha so true! Ego is ego. One could argue there are no acts in this world that does not work to stimulate an ego of a certain kind. No deeds are kind and you serve as a superb example OP. Be sure to at least try to pass of as cheritable if that's your game lol.
---
What's the point of collecting so many eggs?
---
If that's actually happening, reading this sub is going to be like watching a monkey learn how a blender works. With a hammer. And eggs. And glitter. And salt.
---
At least everyone is going to die, laughing, crying, or otherwise. But also glitter.
---
Oh....  well darn then !  I wonder which of those prefixes would do the most damage on a SBQ?  I'm guessing they would be pretty close.
---
One other thing I noticed - if you want to lay down the most efficient damage - do it AFTER the SBQ regenerates.  After the first regeneration her armor seems to be much weaker and my weapons lay down 2-4 tines as much damage per shot. Now I only put in maybe 150-300 total damage on her first regen just to tag her and lay down the bulk of it after the regeneration.
---
oh the irony
---
I don't know about you but I server hoped because I thought I was getting the other player in your spot thing.... but no.
---
It sucks man I feel your pain.
---
Ok everyone - Cody called it.   End of conversation.....
---
Nobody bring up that strangler armor is a known server killer, and that Cody can‚Äôt be watching every location on the map to know what EVERYBODY is doing, so his one pet peeve MUST be the culprit....
---
        Good talk.....
---
Oh - I don't agree at all.  I think that there are plenty of people out there who do kind deeds just for the act itself and never get recognized for it, nor desire to.  Sometimes it's enough to know that you did your part.
---
Those first two are definitely interesting. In your opinion, which is better? I'm new to melee in 76 (my last melee build was fo4)
---
Sweet! Totally jealous
---
Would you give 12 bucks a month?
---
I hope it's just fake news, but I doubt it :(  
---
I like how this post is getting downvoted. It seems like people don't want others to want about what's going on. I'm not going to repost this, I literally just want to save some people from losing their characters or any more stuff.  
---
Lets pray all of this is fake.
---
"AHHHHH!!!!  It's a gift box!  Run away....RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!"
---
Ok, let me give you a simple example.
---
At first when you start the game mobs are relatively weak and do not require any special gear to deal with fast enough. As the game progresses and you travel to new areas of the map, you will eventually encounter mobs that are stronger AND you will start finding gear that makes your character stronger along the way. And you will gain levels and perks that make you stronger as well. It's a natural learning curve that is common to most games of this type. You get stronger, your enemies get stronger, you constantly adapt to the game's learning curve. Most people do so since it's a natural process.
---
The problem is that in this game this learning curve ceases to exist after level 50 and after you encounter level 68 mobs. Yes, there are boss enemies with higher levels, but you encounter them not that often and you know it's a boss fight and it's supposed to be harder if you see one. (And yes, there are raids with lots of design flaws that were discussed numerous times since the release of v94 dlc, I won't take raids in consideration since that part of the game requires some severe rebalancing and it's whole another story.)
---
So, to the main point. The game's learning curve that guides you through the process of getting more powerful and encountering more powerful enemies ceases to exist or simply becomes a flat line after a certain point in game. You can get better gear and start oneshotting everything, you can use chems/food buffs, you can optimize your build even further if there's a space for optimization. There's an ocean of options the game gives you to continue following the initial learning curve naturally. But that all comes in vain because the game stops to bring in more challenging content. There is A LOT of potential currently that could not be applied anywhere outside couple cases that are considered endgame (which is practically nonexistent in this game as a fact). Or it could but it's completely pointless since if you have eyes and can put together some numbers (with basic arithmetical skills most people have since elementary school) you WILL see the way to upgrade your gear to finally start killing stuff that game throws at you. Without chems. Without food buffs. Without the infamous bloodied legendary gear. You name it. The game IS literally that easy. As far as I see it caters to casual players more than anything else.
---
So, what I suggested in my op was to prolongate the natural learning curve indefinitely. Will it require for people with lower levels to change their playstyle? No. They will continue to play and learn naturally that the game becomes a little but harder as you continue to encounter larger numbers before mobs' names. If the balance is right, there will be no difference for an average player to adapt to kill level 20 mob after a level 10 and to kill a level 78 mob (that will be tweaked by the system I suggested) after killing level 68. It will come naturally through revising their gear, perk cards and what else they are carrying around and looting as the game goes.
---
Will it require people with higher levels (200-300) to change their playstyle? Maybe yes, but most won't notice that the game got harder if the balance is right. (Maybe the numbers I presented in the op might need to be toned down a but is all) But they might notice the game started to be more rewarding which would be a good pat on the back for making an effort to switch couple perk cards.
---
Will it require people with very high levels (400+) to change their playstyle? Yes, but most of these guys already know all nooks and crannies and have optimized builds and gear. Most of these people already got bored of the game that completely lacks challenge and better rewards for pushing their builds and gear further to perfection. This is where this system I suggested will shine, bc there finally will be much better risk/reward ratio IF the balance is right.
---
Finally, there will be an incentive to use the full potential of game's resources such as chem and food buffs and top tier gear. People will be able to compete in killing mobs on as highest level as possible and that might become a piece of the endgame content itself. Just by simply making the initial learning curve to go ever upwards indefinitely.
---
Of course there will always be people that won't like new balancing changes and it's natural, you can't always appeal to everyone. There always be people who will say no to some changes, there will always be people who don't like changes at all. There will be people who like to adapt to new challenges and there will be people who won't even see the changes if the balancing is right. And this is what I want for this game. A better balance with better risk/reward ratios that might not be noticable by lower level/casual players and that would be a good challenge for higher level/experienced ones.
---
205 or something. After level 35 is when I really started to enjoy it.
---
Dont be like me and wait until level 85 to experiment with mutations.
---
That's the equivalent of saying "oh this guy doesnt have any legs so he cant run" and saying "JuSt GrOw SoMe IdIoT. Btw ocking you too fuckboy
---
True but all is ego, if it makes you feel good to be of help, then that is a way of self serving, no? I did not say there can't be healthy and unhealthy ego. I merely said a healthy ego need no recognition because the ego is already stimulated by the act of giving, the moment recognition is sought, someone is double dipping in their own reflection.
---
I'm so sick of the turret situation I've only had this in the last few months it is rendering turrets (for me) virtually useless. 
---
If they aren't shooting the extractor 
---
they are shooting my Father Christmas robot 
---
And to the people saying it is no big deal, storing &amp; replacing them twice a day minimum is not a fix!
---
or my Brahmin 
---
&amp; when they've killed them they attack each other.
---
17..... Lol
---
Happened to me last night after taking &amp; fortifying the workshop at Grafton Steel Mill on a 'private server'.
---
As Thalenia noted, storing the malfunctioning turrets (whose names were in red text but not hostile to me) and redeploying them resolved the issue - until the next attack by local fauna, which re-triggered the defect.
---
Annoying to say the least...
---
I‚Äôve heard it a few times on here that there‚Äôs a RNG modifier or something that‚Äôs rolled on character creation and you‚Äôre stuck with it
---
I'm 206 bloodied melee also. I use mysterious savior when I'm running queens because I get sick of loading in the nuke zone, so if I can half that, sweet. But not a necessity.
---
I know its crazy, but there are such things as prosthetic legs.
---
Isn't that why there is a camp budget? Anyway, why couldn't the picture be compressed? Don't need high res for a picture frame image.
---
Lmao you‚Äôre pathetic. God I hope you‚Äôre on PC so I can tear you a new asshole when I see you
---
...On the other side of the building so you have to walk around the building to aggro the scorchbeast.
---
He sells the neon plan, but super rare and expensive.
---
You can buy those plans anywhere honestly. Nothing special
---
I have 2 lvl 200+ characters, a lvl 55, and a lvl 3.
---
That‚Äôs insane.. I would hope they would get compensated more like the scrap box debacle. I really don‚Äôt understand how people have fun ruining other people‚Äôs accounts. I‚Äôm glad this crap doesn‚Äôt affect console players at least.
---
105 on main (don't think i've gained a single rank on that character since nuclear winter came out), 29 on 2nd character which is hilarious because i've done zero story on that one and have made a point not to play a single holotape.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo
---
Interesting. I'm lvl 206 and seen them twice. Please make a list of what vendors you see them at :)
---
You‚Äôre exactly right. One guy by the name of Magnus_Ti or some such gets robbed 3 - 4 times in the video.
---
You can get them randomly from the white springs vendors in the hotel. Not always 100% but it's pretty high. All my characters got it relatively quickly without the grill master
---
I made it a comment, I didn‚Äôt want to edit the post. I‚Äôm a solo player and haven‚Äôt pvp‚Äôd at all. But this surprised me and I actually want to try it. Thanks for helping me understand pvp in 76.
---
Well, they didn‚Äôt disappear when the event briefly stopped for console players, so probably nothing.
---
I've a level 115+, a level 92 and a few low levels
---
No problem. Good luck!
---
Ty!
---
Do the hacks affect console players at all?
---
The guy who made the video ISNT the guy who released the code. I hate to say it but the hack was reported to Bethesda months ago. The youtuber as .u h of a A-hole as he is, made the hack famous, and that gets it fixed
---
Level 425. I have 150ish level ups banked. 
---
I've got a second character who is level 24 and thanks to these Christmas scorched I've had to create a a third mule character who is level 2.
---
They are pricey tho
---
278 and 77
---
No they can only use this stuff on pc. Thankfully Sony and Microsoft protect consoles more than Bethesda does PC.
---
From what we now right now, only PC players are affected. To hack on a console, they would need to hack the console first, which is really unlikely.
---
Mine have never reset, still got pictures of my first ever camp. Is this issue unique to a certain platform? I'm on PC
---
Go ahead, axe us your question, unless you've got an axe to grind with us.
---
Thank you for the heads up, been watching reddit all day constantly on and off because I had a feeling that something horrible is coming. I'm not surprised these pos hackers would do something like this seeing the videos uploaded by them and the actions that they did with theft. They are here to hurt people and cause intentional harm to the game; time to sue them back to their parents basements. If there wasn't enough actions to bring them to civil court; after this there will be no going back from a criminal record.
---
&gt; Everyone
---
You. Just you.
---
The vulnerability problems are part of the engine. The 76 engine is the FO4 engine, which was deliberately designed from the ground up to be porous and easily manipulated on the user end. You can't 'fix' these problems without basically making a new engine (which is absolutely what should have been done). There's just no excuse for this from Bethesda.
---
I introduced a friend to Fallout, and we literally just found that location earlier today and set up a camp for her there. It's a good one for large footprint builds, for sure. Nice work!
---
I managed to find somebody selling the hat (PC) and snapped it up, but haven't found anybody selling the coat yet, unfortunately. Would really like to have both of them but am not into NW.
---
274 and 3 mules. One of them is 10 cause I was missing the lvl 10 achievement.
---
You can sell them for about 4 caps a piece, used to be where you could server hop to gather eggs in mass quantities at point pleasant to sell them and make a good many caps
---
thanks. i still hop around the map looking for interesting locations. but i've been stuck here for a while because how flat and low maintenance (no enemies) it is.
---
I think the first one would be more usable, it has 203 damage with 19 strength (I think). The second one would only be useful if there was still a PVP mode.
---
Greenhouse rains through :/
---
Don't waste your time. You're arguing with fanboys who need to believe that Bethesda is the victim of the players, rather than that they are victims of Bethesda.
---
I've seen this idea before, and I have consistently said it's a clever proposal that would give actual *PURPOSE* to the medical and ammunition vendors in the various depots and faction areas.  I really wish we could get one of the Community Managers to take notice of this.  
---
In fact, tagging u/Ladydevann and u/LoneVaultWanderer so they can pass this along...

It's called no revisioning when you release code.
---
Executioner's is a 50% boost and same with junkies, junkies is more versatile
---
Lets be reasonable...
---
Nerd Rage is a must if you run your health under 20%. Prime your UGL if you haven't already. Assuming you've got all the Heavy Gunner perks for when you're using your UGL? Also make sure you're running Stabilized and wearing Power Armor, have Adrenal Reaction, and max out Adrenaline and Bloody Mess. Pop a Psychotats, and get in her face and unload that UGL. Keep something else handy for when she's in the air and you can kill adds to get the boost from Adrenaline for when she lands. Keep your health down around 10-15% and you'll watch her health meter fall faster than you ever imagined. 50 damage per shot is easily done, which works out to 1300 DPS or so.
---
Damn wish you were on ps4. I want these outfits but have no time to do the grind required for it.

With the amount they charge in the Atom Shop, it should be free.

I will say a couple months of FO1 has cleaned my regular stash box out nicely. Not sure how long the stockpiled junk will last, but I'm also not sure how long I'm gonna keep playing that character.
---
Being invisible isn't cheating. That's what stealthboys do.
---
That's why I use both a .50 and a Gatling and I enjoy myself immensely. The "ignore 50% armor, faster fire rate" .50 for when I just want/need to shred a whole lotta shit in a short period of time, and the TSE Gatling when a slower, more refined can of whoop-ass will do the job. The Gatling's also pretty good as a medium range sniper rifle, as long as you use the dot on the screen instead of the added sight.
---
Yes it must be a trick!
---
&gt;Major tech companies do absolutely pay hackers to find and report bugs, but it's not as common a practice as it should be. 
---
Google, apple, samsung, SONY, microsoft, etc. all offer major bug bounties. 
---
Just because some doesn't doesn't mean that they are in the majority. They really aren't.
---
&gt;I'm not sure why, I'm not really that well versed on the subject. Do you have any idea why companies might not want to put resources into outsourcing bug fixing with rewards?
---
They are cheap, look at the money the tech companies offer for these bounties. They have to be enough to be more valuable to report it than to sell it on the black market.
---
Oh it could be done i just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre in a position to. User created content would be awesome, fingers crossed someday we get some!
---
Your selling a new account??? What's the stats/inventory?
---
I‚Äôm on xbox and I‚Äôve never had them reset either. Maybe a ps4 issue?
---
Yeah I'm just waiting for the full overhaul of wastelanders before i give them a dime again. Burned for a year so fuck bethesda. That pc exploit over christmas was just another example of them being warned (the hacker warned them what they could do) and not responding till after the fact.
---
Hopefully with wastelanders they remove junk weight entirely once stashed which will speed loads up because it wont be calculating more info and then fix the damn perk cards.
---
So you have issue with the fact a dataminer reported and sent the fix to bethesda over a week before it was released? What would you have preferred the dataminer to do? You realize the user "player" you see doing the bug in all the youtube videos is a dataminer who was just trying to bring it to everyones attention so that it would get fixed before it went public.
---
So if he isn't a good guy, why?!?
---
No I'm selling  a pvp perk build .
---
With the amount of rads I have all the time, this only seems logical lore-wise.
---
Yeah then he went and released made it public and used it to harm players... Yeah he's not tge good guy.. Talking about issues and exploits then using them is just dishonest and hypocritical
---
Tard
---
Who knows. Some people think it‚Äôs ok to glitch the game and that it is impossible that it‚Äôs responsible for crashes... what platform
---
&gt;Never once did they step back. I'm pretty sure it makes sense buddy. The hackers say they "reported" the week before, during holiday season...and then used it full force.
---
The user "player" you see in the youtube videos demonstrating it (not 532 guy) is a dataminer not a hacker, he wrote up a full report and fix for this hack a week before it went public. 
---
He tried to do everything he could to stop it, but bethesda chose to ignore it even though it was such a major exploit.
---
If you are going to make claims at least get the facts correct.
---
"player" the user you see in the youtube videos is a dataminer that reported it and wrote up a fix for it, bethesda chose to ignore it.
---
Atleast lvl 91 glowing/scorched deathclaws are decent.
---
Not the same person there genius "player" isn't erect ban the creator of the strangler heart trade tool that was modified to steal all items.
---
The dude that stole 532 peoples shit is just a random script kiddie that used the modified hack from EB.
---
Presuming that Fallout 76 1st is not at risk so long as one‚Äôs contact/friends list is empty.
---
I only have my single mule added as a friend, no one else.
---
https://youtu.be/gJrFCIdvvZw
---
I would go ahead and say that at this point all parties involved in these acts should be considered cyber terrorists. They are out to hurt others and cause fear in a community of people; if that's not the exact definition of a terrorist I don't know what is.
---
The messenger.
---
My game has been crashing like crazy today too, while it has been almost crashless since the double xp weekend.
---
Not sure what's going on! I'm on PC. I just loaded in to play, crashed when looking around near where I spawned. Reloaded game, waited for a bit, then tried to fast travel, which crashed the game. Now I've reloaded again, and it appears a bunch of my ammo has duplicated itself (I had \~600 .45, now I have 999+) - went to eat some food to restore hunger, crashed... well, not responding. Hasn't actually exited game yet...
---
Definitely food build issues
---
I'm playing in a private server with team only turned on ever since I read on reddit about the upcoming (now patched) inventory stealing hack. I don't think we should have an issue there. I hope I'm right.
---
I rarely, as in almost never, read *anything* on reddit that gives me pause to reflect.  Thank you.
---
Dude PC players are a complete afterthought for Bethesda game devs.
---
Yup. Level 192 and still gotta be careful. They get ya.
---
1x1 and 1x2 tiles needs atomshop variants for our floors.   Cannot believe they half ass.  No. 1/3 ass those floors.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and still see pics in load screens from last year
---
Survival of the fittest eh?
---
I'm saying the companies that don't do it are cheap, because the bounties have to be worth more money to turn in than it would be for the hacker to sell the hack on the black market.
---
I just put the small concrete barricades on the other side of the door just behind it so that when they picked it they still couldn't get in but they got a bounty and then watched other players come and kill them lol then I would procede to close the door and relock it.
---
I wish there was an in-world mailbox system where you could send pictures.
---
I like to stalk people and take pictures of them discreetly, all the better if they're quietly sleeping inside of their homes.
---
I bought the set for 300c. Way easier lol
---
Why would you spread this around? 
---
Two things result from this: More people feel bad watching, and he gets more views. Delete the thread dude. xD
---
That would require the hackers to be in america or countries that have laws against what they are doing. I know the guy who has created the last few hacks "erect ban" is in russia so he is untouchable.
---
Game is broken what do you expect?
---
It totally depends on your build. If you go heavy gunner with all the perks and power armor then use heavy guns. If you go shotguns or rifles the power armor does not benefit you (stabilized perk). I personally rock heavy guns and rifles with one character. Managed to get the perks for both by stripping some of the QoL perks. Easy switch between heavy gunner / shotguns and commando / rifleman when needed
---
Semi-permanent? Somebody has fear.
---
Once you finish the snowflake challenge it will show back up, same thing happened to me.
---
I am saying you are boring. Also I already know about that.
---
Yeah, Im sure you have a good fulfilling life and that's not a lie at all that you have to make fun of a kid to make you feel better about yourself lol
---
I‚Äôll have to disagree with you there as this is ultimately depends on how someone personally gauge ‚Äúwinning‚Äù in a game. 
---
For me personally if it‚Äôs online everyone should have the same experience of progression as the developer intended.. Think of it as you were playing world of warcraft and your pushing M+ keys for weeks to gear up and gather currency. But someone surpasses you by downloading a tool
---
oh, ok thanks for telling me
---
Yeah, Im sure you have a good fulfilling life and that's not a lie at all that you have to white knight for a kid to make you feel better about yourself lol
---
I did an Enclave Bots on Parade event tonight and the robots started attacking each other during the event.  In workshops the turrets love to attack the power connectors now or each other.  It is totally hosed.
---
this game has reminded me of old ultima online since the beginning.
---
I dont support hacking. But I feel like these hackers are showing the truth about this game to people the hard way.  It's a pile of unorganized mess that is cobbled together unprofessionally and has been imploded since launch.
---
Fair enough. I've never seen that guy and I'll revise what I say about the matter.
---
Maybe Beth couldn't figure out how to close it right up until they actually got it (It was "closed" the day after mass use) Plus it being so close to holidays.  I'm not much for championing corporations but their moral in office would be a contributing factor.
---
I'm in the camp they should have released on open fallout 76 that was moddable like the single player but online (Servers similar to how TF2 used to do it) with a F2P BR that followed Fortnites model so my take on anything Beth does is pretty lackadaisical.  I also don't really care whether my gear is lost or not so the hack isn't something I have rage about so keep in mind I'm mostly just a casual observer that scoots about the wasteland because I got the game for free. 
---
I prefer Fallout shelter over Fallout76.
---
Don't forget when you die you only lose your junk  and you can go back to get it. Don't be scared go out there have fun die a lot find great rare item's it's fun I promise
---
Game still broken? Can't be. &gt;.&gt;
---
That's a 5 Star Legendary!
---
Thanks a lot for the heads-up. By the way, before I read your reply, someone has already downvoted it. Hackers trying to drown the warning possibly?
---
Sounds like a load of shit by a troll to me, because npcs do not respawn elsewhere, essentials get downed, I think the dude wants attention and is fear mongering, I hope im right
---
It's weird but 100% of the time it will work and spawn a queen for me if I'm doing it by myself, but the rewards are like one piece of leather armor at the end. If others are present at the event no queen will spawn but it rewards the usual chems/food/water and ammo.
---
Neat idea
---
This.  
---
There is a receiver mod that also increases the ROF as well as the legendary effect but even with both it's not a high ROF weapon.
---
Sometimes though you just have to launch yourself into the thick of the action. Occasionally  you will manage to take everything out.
---
Heavy guns are for boss fights, rifles are for farming average medium to easy creatures. Rifles‚Äô real strength is taking advantages of stealth multiplication and aimbot (‚Äòvats‚Äô). This combination gives player a sense of power and ammo efficiency. But for boss fights such as SBQ those advantages are gone and it becomes more costly to use rifle than heavy guns. The gatling for instance have very high damage per shot but the ammo is cheap to make and the drum is much larger than rifle‚Äôs mag. Super mutants also drop them in the hundreds.
---
I really hope you're right too.
---
I do this still!  Lvl almost 60 lol.
---
Wouldn't it be cool if the game worked on medium end pc's that are not made from gold?
---
   Right now the West Virginia Wasteland is much easier than it was at launch; as someone who has played from a month after launch the game has dropped in terms of open world difficulty. Originally enemies could travel out of their corresponding zones so you would end up with situations that were crazy. One case being one of my first times stopping in Flatwoods on my first character and seeing a level 50 Grafton Monster for the first time waltzing across the bridge coming from the agriculture center. 
---
  The game has really toned down since then with enemies only staying at predictable spots where they always are and the ever looming threat of Scorch Beasts being almost removed as you rarely see them nowdays. The only really dangerous spot in the entire map would be the Cranberry Bog with that being the almost sole location for roaming Scorch Beasts. 
---
   I would relax and take leveling slowly rather than power leveling; the most fun you can have is being a low level in a wide and dangerous world. Like others say using sneak when you feel like the area is dangerous and using vats to scout out areas before you enter them will keep you one step ahead. As long as you wait until level 30 and beyond to push forward into the mountain region and then 40 before Cranberry Bog you should be fine to survive most encounters.
---
I would be glad to take you on a adventure if you are on PC and show you some ropes to survival and dealing with the threats out there.
---
Is this only on pc or all consoles?
---
Know a location to spawn for a 100% random encounter and just spend a few hours server hopping.
---
Melee is still meta for the SBQ but it's fairly specialized. Guys in the discord I'm with can take her down solo in 2 to 3 hits. But doing 3k+ damage with melee is standard and easy to achieve without food/alcohol/bobblehead/chem stacking.  If you are interested in seeing some of the different builds the hard hitters use or getting help I can DM you a link to the discord. Even if your platform isnt xb1 they are super helpful in optimizing all types of builds.
---
They won't even give us new hair styles
---
Powering up your vending machine just makes it visible on the map to fast travel to . Otherwise people can just walk up to it and purchase what you have listed.
---
You either have to remove the vending machine or make it inaccessible to interact with. If you want to prevent people from buying listed items...
---
Then just use the tickets to get the sell ables. Or get the ammo that sells for more or whatever.
---
How many did you scrap in the end?
---
I built 8 (Got 11 thanks S-Duper) scrapped them for 8 mods, and now with the Prime and 2 purchaseable plans I'm at 11/14.
---
i would like this idea, but it would also destroy my cap income.
---
f.e. i only use fusion cores and 5mm. I sell all the others in my vending machine, as i run an almost fully vampire build, i dont use stimpacks either and sell these aswell. 
---
Now if id get only vouchers, this would stop, and people wouldnt need to go vending machine buying for ammo and aid, as they could just get specificly what they'd need. so this would cause the market for alot of people to basicly crash. 
---
so i like the idea, but i would never want this to be implemented in any way shape or form.
---
" Resort to terrorizing methods as a means of coercion, or the state of  fear and submission produced by the prevalence of such methods. " Although yours was a definition surprisingly enough; terrorism goes way beyond politics in modern times though.
---
Is it actually possible? I mean how can script on client side DELETE character on server side? Looks like trolling
---
Wouldn't even be surprised if people could find a way to inject some unauthorized code in the picture to exploit some stuff via a stack overflow or something like it happens a lot.
---
If you have not noticed that so far, meaning the difference were not apparent to you, then you might be able to go without any weight  reduction perks at all and use something else instead. ;)
---
Why can't we just make our own characters origins already?
---
A simple raider would be fun.
---
Super mutant with a change of heart?
---
Any of the power armor factions.
---
Seriously, sometimes I don't wanna be the big hero that changes the fate of destiny. Sometimes I just wanna be a simple wastelander
---
Cool thanks, will do.
---
Coming soon to Fallout 1st.
---
Got a video?
---
Some angry old farts who claimed F3 to be "Oblivion with guns" are probably wishing Bethesda to fail. And they help this possible failure with all the best they can.
---
you're gay
---
time for this shit game to die. It's time for you noobs to play Fallout: New Vegas.
---
Wow thanks for all that! I really appreciate it. Quick question, is FO76 somehow different in that I'll need to change that behaviour from other RPG's? I'm scrolling down this thread and replying as I go and I've seen it mentioned a few times to not hoard gear.
---
Always works fine for me. Sorry :(
---
To become Scorched. Half-hiveminded. You can't attack any other Scorched or SB, SBQ will make you run away in terror. Sometimes your character will shout funny phrases, such as "Sir, do you have a minute to talk about a possibility to be one with us?"
---
"TOGETHER?!"
---
See, I actually was of the understanding that if you're not physically there at the workshop, then the enemies don't attack anything because they don't get spawned/loaded until a player is nearby?
---
It's probably something worth testing.
---
Wait what? Permakill on players? How does that even work? We would stay dead and unable to fast travel? Couldn‚Äôt we just ALT+F4 out of the game and reappear in a new session?
---
I want to be a glowing one.
---
Console corporate sheep race, without any chance of doing anything about it.
---
Actually I hadn't considered the Grognak Axe, guess that makes 4!
---
I was thinking of the Hatchet, Multi-purpose Axe and Fire Axe.
---
Here, go to the end of this video. You can see all of the XP rewarded in each category. You get 20XP per teammate revive, but I'm usually covering instead of reviving. 
---
https://youtu.be/542opvmpuD8
---
I‚Äôm with you guys :( I play on PS4 and I don‚Äôt have this problem fortunately , but that‚Äôs a very bad thing , someone says ‚Äúgive 1st free one month‚Äù but I think is not sufficient for people who lost everything , maybe after hundreds hours of farming to get what they have . I hope for those people who lost everything , Bethesda can give them back ,
---
&gt; allow you to be permakilled
---
How would that even work though? We would be locked out of fast travel on death? Our inventory would be emptied again and we would remain locked forever on the ground as a corpse? What would happen if we just force quit the game and find a new session?
---
I have no doubt that there‚Äôs likely a new hack coming in but I‚Äôm doubtful it‚Äôs as safe proof and permanent as it might be. There is no way a permadeath is compatible with how the game works lol
---
This is really helpful,no need to search them individually,thanks &lt;3
---
Why do you think the OP cares, they are probably this person anyway.
---
Congrats on the Gold, well deserved.
---

Yep and im not going to be pleased at being made to download files from random people. It's a nice idea but I'd skip this every chance.
---
Don‚Äôt be ageist, could be people if any age, color, sexuality or lack thereof.
---
May be non humans or animals even inanimate objects that hate the game and Bethesda.
---
Karma is gonna be cruel when it eventually comes back around to decimate you.
---
Or religious and other reasons.
---
This is entirely fake and is being spread by that person to cause panic. He does this a lot. Also this message is actually from a discord and not a forum
---
Yawn ü•±
---
Anything that's uses for something like grenades, or a quest, wont autoscrap.
---
PC only so far, Microsoft and Sony have much stronger protection built into their devices.
---
Probably even more. Somehow I have gotten my okay weapons from world drops but nothing good from the purveyor. I've dropped more than 10k.
---
Yup, they will do that. Best bet is to stay back and use a piece of terrain to dance around so it can't hit you. Then your free to shoot at it.  Be warned they also take a ton of damage to kill
---
Use a handmade and click click click vote #2 xD
---
I have played since beta, the first few weeks I was completely unaware of the hate train because once I started playing I didnt do anything else for a bit. its why the hate train blew my mind. I had experienced some bugs and faults but it was nothing like all the you tube videos made it out to be.  doesnt matter he is already here any ways.
---
Lol good video. Those were the days
---
Not currently
---
I‚Äôm like level 83 and I still haven‚Äôt dropped a nuke, did have an opportunity to help take down the Queen for the first time though.
---
I can confirm I am on ps4 and have never had mine reset
---
it would be possible if the game handles death in some dumb way, which it probably does. If he actually could turn players into npcs this could cause your server side save to break I guess
---
I‚Äôve had my camp here for a long time as well. Plenty of room to build and a nice view
---
I understand why you want this, I just don't expect it to happen, pretty sure if it could be done, it would have been done by now, but BGS might surprise us and add it at some point, possibly.  
---
However, I suspect it would just add more lag to the servers and possibly contribute towards instability.
---
It‚Äôs the same prompt and cursor you see when you activate your companion command menu in Fallout 4. Most likely just left over code but they may use it for the companions that come with Wastelanders
---
I think it's because it's stored on your local side. A video showed the "servers" are almost entirely dependent on the player side. It's actually almost a scam what Bethesda is trying to have servers appear to players as. 
---
**Not wanting to be negative I like this game but check the video out if you can. It's on YouTube explaining how the fallout76 servers work in detail.
---
Have you tried running baka?
---
Maybe I should get out more üòü
---
I sell rare mounted plans for 3k was 1400 but realise  I was selling them cheap. Santa and icicles 1k as I‚Äôve so many that I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre rare at all. The plasma I would hold onto until everyone sold theirs cheap and then the price will go up.
---
It's a script that makes it as if you "yourself" on client side deleted your character by choice.
---
test if it works both ways(positive and/or neg) - hop into group and see if u get the bonus stats instead. Record it with screenshot if possible, then try logging out(completely, kill client and re-open game)
---
If persists, send ticket. With evidence so they can't just 'you prob forgot to turn your computer on' excuse.
---
It likely is just a bug that will go away on its own, but if not, knowing how support is for this game, and with recent 'other' issues, its best to make sure you have hard proof to back up that there is an actual problem, or they will simply try to write you off as an idiot who can't tell the ground from the sky.
---
I run at 40-60% health.  Load up on rads to keep my health stable
---
Its not just going to effect Bethesda games. As for a pos game why play it if you don't like it let alone join a community for it.
---
Armor repair wouldn't even be an issue if scrapper gave us ballistic fiber for military outfits, combat armor and marine armor but personally I don't even bother repairing armor unless I actually like it when it hits low conditions I just throw on the next piece I pick up or don't bother and jump in power armor when I do something that needs it.
---
Maybe it's time for Bethesda to split these categories.
---
Category 1 should be all Junk Items that only break down in to components and can utilize Scrap All
---
Category 2 should be all Junk Items that are used in crafting or active quests. Those items should have a separate Scrap All function or should be Scrap Manually
---
That would be a big QOL improvement
---
Yeah my main has pretty average luck.
---
Bloodied explosive powerful auto handmade or bloodied ffr powerful auto combat rifle. Bloodied commando vats crit sneak build with max lifegiver to work with standard backpack lead mod. 3x3star unyielding marine 1x3star chameleon marine
---
Never blast zone, fuck radiation, Squat the fence, mob, adrenaline, queen. Still sometimes I die. no big deal.
---
Yeah, might be even something like that.
---
you can blueprint them (go into build mode and create blueprint with just the vending machines) and store them as-is (it will 'remember' items placed in them @ current prices, but objects will not show in stash as in vender when they are blueprinted)
---
That way nobody can buy from them since they don't 'exist'
---
You beat the game, move on.
---
It never did that for me...
---
The AI in this game is more A than I
---
I had this too. Take a load more radaway and it will go.
---
I use an AAE handmade, then an Executioner's fixer when her health gets low. I also pop psychotats. I need the event to last around 7 minutes or I lose out on her loot. I probably fail about 25% of the events these days, but folks at the event these days have been particularly high level recently, so I'm totally fine with that going in.
---
I mean... we arent getting all of our stuff stolen and running onto Preston Garvey so I'm thinking the people who are having those issues and still that they are better might be sheep. Lol.
---
Nah no here has tried it yet. We're all waiting like you. You go try it and tell us how it is.
---
I don't play video games.
---
Cut the power and lock them in
---
No
---
Still though better safe than sorry; alot of people sadly ended up on the sorry side of things with the inventory theft hack recently.
---
Ive been using the Instigating Survival Fire Axe recently and love it! It does double damage if the target has full health.
---
I thought I was the only one?
---
I have a pool of 70. Had a convo just now with a buddy who has already done a month of private.. this idiot sayin they don't trust Bethesda to keep the public server safe so they are going to keep paying for fucking private. What kind of shittin' logic is that?
---
Pretty sure signed contracts still mean something in Russia though
---
Aight, I've given it a go
---
Yep tested the mutation and it applies once i've teamed up (Pic: https://imgur.com/tK5CdRF). Logged out, closed client and... still there. Now for the fun of tickets.
---
Thanks for getting back so quickly
---
Welcome on board :) I realized it after some weeks after beta :)
---
PSA: The gatling gun fires slow when the trigger is held. Instead you have to pull the trigger repeatedly exactly at the right time to fire much faster. Not many players seem to know about this.
---
I'd beg to differ. There's a guy demonstrating what a rifle can do. He kills sbq in less than 10 seconds using a 2* bloodied handmade. What he does is use stealth and consumables and crit perk modifiers to boost the damage. He just vats the head and dishes an insane amount of damage. Even in flight sbq the damage is insane.
---
&gt;Order of Mysteries
---
:D Reddit seems so similar to 9gag these days
---
First off, for any of the Mod Plans to drop, you have to learn the Base Plan for that Weapon. The chances of the Mod Plans dropping are dependant on the amount of Brahmin alive at the end of the Event.
---
+ 1 Brahmin alive = 0.667% chance
---
+ 2 Brahmin alive =2% chance
---
+ 3 Brahmin alive = 3.33% chance
---
The odds are equal for all Mods and the Base Plan
---
Agreed. However Bethesda should have not tried to release a game in a state like they did. Also all the mistreatment towards fans was poor. Here is SOME of them.
---
**The beta not working and having to redownload it within the 2-3 hours it was online, the multiple huge 50-60gig patches just so they can  modify  300MB of code. The fallout bag bait and switch, the 90 dollar plastic Nuka Cola liquor bottles. The 500 atom apology. Releasing the fallout 1st subscriptions while not actually having private servers and bugged stash boxes. 
---
**Really it's so much that there are 1+ hour long videos without even touching upon the actual hacks due to rushing the game out without ANY security measures.
---
I'm going to start by saying it's not exactly a sequel, it's a multiplayer predecessor. In saying that I would advise checking out Fallout New Vegas for great story and RPG aspects. However, if you catch fallout 76 on a free weekend I would advise checking it out then as this makes a better testing chance as the game is very hit or miss for people. I personally liked the game, but mostly when playing with friends.
---
Speed demon mutation works since they are "hand cranked" or has that changed?
---
Looking into too much? Anyone in here the past year knows there's something up. This is observable. Conspiracies aren't observable. How can you simple rule out shady practices? What moral code do you believe companies are following that they wouldn't engage in such tactics when profits are on the line? The game is about to go to Steam. People have stuck with this game an entire year and a much awaited DLC is coming. Beth will be eating into other companies profits. This is not up for debate. You can honestly tell me anything you like, but as a consumer on THIS sub?... eh, I'm gonna bet that you aren't being honest with me in the slightest. Infowars pushed gross shit. Called school shooting false flags.. I'm suggesting that advertising is using social media .. and this is equitable to you? Fucking Christ. Where are the critical thinkers at? When did everyone start trusting every anon line of text claiming sincerity? It's stunning how stupid and gullible the internet has made the younger gens.
---
Honestly, pc needs to keep their filth away from consoles for the time being.  Consoles are sailing smooth for the most part.  It would just put us in the same hacker ruined hell pc has to deal with.  If it weren't for that issue, I would be all for crossplay.
---
Its a prequel and i would say if f4 nuka world was up to your standards then its fine but new vegas or far harbor it ain't
---
All 1267 Plans? Better get to work!
---
Cool. I dont appear to be that far of base then. Thanks!!
---
On a real note. If you enjoyed fallout 4 I think you‚Äôll enjoy 76. Maybe you want to wait for wastelanders within the next few months tho if human npcs and dialogue trees is a dealbreaker.
---
The solution is simple: Make it so turrets can attack wanted players, but wanted players can't destroy those turrets unless they are actually engaged in PvP with the owner of the turrets. You want to be wanted, then face the hardships of it.
---
I GOT IT ! This is the best day ever. Thanks so much.
---
&gt;ng with friends.
---
Thank you very much, I usually play single player shooters, 76 in this case might not be the right thing for me.. New Vegas is as I see quite old, and worst, not available on PS4p pro... Lately I became super lazy, only sofa gaming last few years :)
---
I used to always have a shotgun turret or two behind my locked front door and another locked door behind them, but now I have a wall, which I simply store and replace when I am either in my CAMP or plan on being away from my CAMP.
---
Wires will usually go through the walls if you have the wire going through an open window and then change the wall type to solid.
---
Anyway the best is make a second character and with a friend you transfer everything you don‚Äôt really need from your main one , and there you go :) free again! I do it from month and I also don‚Äôt need to buy the 1st to have 2/300 space in my loot box
---
riflebuilds depend heavily on sneak attacks thats when they get powerfull a run and gun type of rifleman build isnt that great
---
Check fo76maps.com
---
Yh I hav been using this the problem is body of water army marked. Like small lakes and streams but Yh
---
there was 2 ways to steal items as far as i know and they fixed only 1
---
No, it isn't, what you said there is complete and utter bs.
---
Nope a far worse exploit is coming. I like this game and hope by waste landers it gets an overall. Basically the game is an online fallout 4 mod underneath the hood. The assets are new.
---
**It allows you to play online with others but gives them complete access to your own local game as if you were playing a single player modded fallout offline by yourself. 
---
**It Opens the door to stuff Such as delete character scripts. It happens on your side as if you yourself  chose this action.
---
Well... that seemed to work. Granted it did take 13 Radaways, but thank you for the solution.
---
All I can say is sorry that you now have to do that fun-time-super-exciting route. (Support is never fun lol)
---
You could lean into it and go full out class freak/starched and the end result is less than 1 penalty to each stat when solo.(I think?)
---
Still, I feel your pain and I also did my best to avoid that mutation since I'm 100% lone wolfing it.
---
I believe Some of that team is made of interns as well.
---
Yup there is a special place after he dies for people like him. That is psychopath behavior.
---
Ok thats cool, i didn‚Äôt think to try that :)
---
Man you are missing out.  With a faster fire rate varient these things own.  With the right perks when you get warmed up you can just 1 shot most enemies and they have laser accuracy and suburb distance.  IMHO best gun in the game.
---
Acts of terrorism cause physical harm, doesn't include hurt feelings.
---
Look online videos. The entire npc, the dialogue choices, location changes, and even the questlines have been leaked now.
---
Same with metal grate upper floors if you need to go up/down. Then just change to the flooring you want.
---
Yes true, but the lower Level ones are not tough at all!
---
Sweet, I‚Äôll try that too thanks!
---
I miss the fallout 4 wire glitch it kept my settlements nice and tidy
---
I agree. That was pretty scary and would actually make them fearsome!
---
Indeed, but I count myself lucky someone else had the solution. Thanks for the assist, good to rule out possibilities and also get Bethesda on to preventing this in the future (though I doubt it)
---
I vote to skip the extra large magazine.  There is no need for 500 rounds with this gun and it just adds unneeded weight.  (I try and rock 90% reduced weight ones.
---
Wow, I thought I was a no lifer.. Imagine adults scamming children, and even having 'friends' supporting you. Disgusting.
---
ErectBan is Canadian.
---
Fake. To quote EBs thread: "You realize a lot of the things said here are on purpose bullshit. Because a lot of youtubers read this thread to make their stupid videos".
---
It's possible yes, and as a PS4 player I'd like cross play with Xbox, PC however can keep away with all their hacking going on.
---
You could just use certain workshops for water but I think the mire or toxic valley would have the most
---
Between consoles? Yup of course. Is Bethesda doing this? Lol no sorry.....this game was very poorly put together. The actual developers worked very hard but it's a case of incredibly poor upper management. 
---
**It was all about meeting a release date and the dollar bill first with this release. This company has really changed for the worse due to management. It happened when they got some huge new investors a few years ago.
---
I know that and its definitely handy but they should just go through anyway.
---
Its been that way since they patched the collectron not despawning
---
You think the CEO of zenimax is making creative decisions? You want to be able to wear outfits from a different game In this game? That‚Äôs kind of silly. They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúremove content‚Äù. All they did was use the same ingredients to build something new. This is not fallout 4. They just didn‚Äôt waste time designing artwork and models from the ground up. You people will find anything to complain about.
---
I've heard that when Xbox goes through the certs, they have uhhhh.. established coding? And if that coding is altered in any way, the system can't connect to 'xbox live' or whatever it is now.
---
I'm not sure if that's true or not, but it would be pretty damn smart.
---
Wow, that is extremely noticeable and worth learning to master. Thanks for that!
---
I'm going to try to master it.
---
This. Soo bad this. I love ghouls.
---
I thought it was a brilliant idea then I read your post and you're right :(
---
no
---
This isn‚Äôt a sequel, it‚Äôs a spinoff. And yes it‚Äôs in good shape to play, console has less exploits.
---
Be mindful! If you time it wrong it'll briefly jam, throwing off your rhythm.
---
Explosive is a waste on the queen as it is almost always reduced to 0-1 damage by her resistances. Use +10% damage while aiming or FFR instead.
---
I'm a full health heavy build and my strategy is as follows:
---
\- When she is in the air, I hit her with my *Furious +10% aim Primed Gatling Gun* that does 10-20 damage due to distance.
---
\- When she lands, I use my *Furious +10% aim Primed 50 Cal* and shoot her in the face. Without adrenaline, I get 32 dmg/shot at 9.1 shots/second. About 150 rounds puts you above the loot-damage threshold. Fewer may not cut it because due to bugs/latency, only 2/3 of the rounds are registering in my experience. If you can buff yourself with Adrenaline, the number goes up to 57 dmg/shot
---
\- After that initial 50 cal salvo, I switch back to the *F10 Primed Gatling Gun*. Each headshot can deal 50-120 damage depending on Adrenaline but at a rate of 2.5 shots/second.
---
Note thought that I found these weapons to be an ammo waste against most regular scorched or small-frame enemies. For example, santa scorched die from 2 hits from the GG but they'd die from my AAE non-prime GG in 2 hits too. The 50 cal has somewhat a bad spread (despite PA+Stabilized) and takes more bullets to hit for sure.
---
On console? Yup go for it. Totally worth the 20 bucks I paid for it. About 50 hours in so far. 
---
**It is a great multiplayer Fallout "survival" game. It's a survival game with some light RPG Fallout in it. Great atmosphere, music, and most players I've come accoss have been friendly with many being longtime fallout series fans.
---
Ever since the low level gift opening thing was discovered, a lot of people got most of the rare plans.
---
I hate to be that guy .. but this could have been staged. This could be acting. It doesn't sit right with me. Something is off with it.
---
Agreed. People coming after wastelanders should not be dwellers. That title was earned by us fuckers playing with a 400lb stash and unending glitches.
---
They can be newcomers. They'll be welcome. But we are the vault.
---
Yeah, some sort of ‚Äòfeature‚Äô. Annoyed me at the time too.
---
Yes. Power just means your camp doesn‚Äôt show up on the map anymore.
---
Poor kid, how awful. Hope some of the fo76 community can teach a lesson to these bullies! I'm on xbox so unable to offer any help unfortunately otherwise I would
---
It's posted by the same person that used the hack to strip a bunch of players just before Christmas.  
---
I guess it's possible, but that sounds like real sorrowful tears.
---
Did you level up in both game modes?
---
The upvotes on the post are likely due to these trolls having multiple accounts. Reddit really needs to get rid of the point system. It's too easily abused/manipulated.
---
I gained enough advebture mode xp to level up in adventure mode. I did go up a level, just didnt get any perks or perk card pack
---
&gt;ike watching a monkey learn how a blender works. With a hammer. And eggs. And glitter. And salt.
---
This may be the most beautiful, glorious description of something I've ever read. And i'm a professional writer. ;-)
---
No it isn't. Whoever gave em gold is full of shit too. This fuckery is so transparent at this point that if you've bought into this hype-hate-hybrid-hijinks, there's no hope for you.
---
Hey I ran at 1440 medium on my old rig and I built it in 2010 apart from GPU a few years ago.
---
Charleston was a bit Ropey though üòú
---
Was Phenom x6 1055t and RX480
---
False. Cyber terrorism doesn‚Äôt cause physical harm.
---
That's what I was gonna say. If OP lasted a whole-ass year thinking the perk worked on their stash, they must have inventory management skills that would make Marie Kondo mindlessly froth with envious rage.
---
This is about money.
---
We don't know and given Beth's bug reputation, I can imagine quite a bunch of bad scenarios.
---
However, if you don't want to sell them later, you could opening them all before that. They contain decent amount of caps and scrip by chance(depending on the size), therefore, you can then use the caps to buy wrapping paper to craft more and use the scrip on the mystery pick for example.
---
You do realize you are being a complete tool right? You're only giving the "hackers" a delicious dose of salt they were craving for.
---
Haha, ok I need to lock my doors more. I agree, I would love to have a in world mail box just so I can send letter and stuff as well as photos!
---
I cannot change your minds because I agree good sir o7
---
Great idea but like others says might just break the game engine (doesn‚Äôt take much these days) but damn, it would be a cool idea!
---
No sense removing those perks (barbarian and blocker)there‚Äôs nothing else you can perk for that‚Äôs going to increase damage
---
Fastest method is to simply log out.  I recommend keeping an alternate character or second account(You can get them pretty cheap) and use it as a bank character.  Either get a trusted friend to transfer them for you if you are using a second character on the same account or run a second copy of the game at the same time and transfer the caps if you get a second account.  If you have Fallout 1st, you can easily transfer caps without the chance of anyone buying more if you go to a private server.  Otherwise, you will be risking someone fast traveling to your camp before you load in.
---
If you have the chance, turn off the vending machines before you log out so that people won't be able to fast travel to your camp.  Or if you want an easier solution, just use garage doors block people's ability to get to the vending machines when you close them.  There are two issues with this method though.  If the base is still loading in, people might be able to jump through the door.  Also, if someone is in the vending machine when you close the door, they will still be able to buy things until they exit it.
---
I would recommend trying to stay around 10,000 caps.  It is enough to buy most things, and it gives enough space for people to buy items without making you go over.  I know this was more than you asked, but hopefully it helps.
---
Oh silly me, you must be theforemost expert in cyber security. I keep forgetting that everyone on the internet is the preimere expert in the field they're full of shit about. 
---
Yeah, people DO get paid by companies to find problems in software and fix it. Hell there's a whole convention in Vegas every year about it. 
---
Do you know what these people DON'T DO? They DON'T release the exploit they found onto the internet and tell everyone else about it.
---
Bethesda has said this is coming (next quarter?). I use a mod for this on PC now. My build wouldn't be playable without it.
---
They spawn and do shit without you being there, that's why it's server based, example if you put defenses up like turrets and don't bother defending it there's a chance the turrets will do some work before getting destroyed and you can tell this by the bar in the top right letting you know how many enemies are left. Unlike F04 and Skyrim everything is loaded in without you being there due to Bethesda's new non "Atlas System" that they got rid of for 76. Only thing not loafed are textures for the most part. Other than that its been tested thoroughly. Enemies don't give AF of you're there or not üòÇ
---
Great, ty
---
Man that's exciting, can't wait!
---
Great! Hum, since it is multiplayer, so you need PS Plus subscription or is this game an exception?
---
Checked it out yesterday and the deathclaw came right away. üëç And I like to add, that MG42 slides through that thing like butter.
---
It‚Äôs the wrapping paper aiming computer to spread the holiday love.
---
I love this game but the lack of end game things to do has definitely made me a bit more creative when it comes to messing with people in a fun-not-trolly way lol. Another favourite thing to do is sleep in someone's bed then leave behind cream, rubber, and a mutfruit.
---
Just perk loadouts though and not weapons/armor.  Unless I missed something I'm pretty sure that's all they had announced.
---
If you use small water purifiers, you don't have to be on the water, just near it
---
Drop your perception to 3 for sure.   All you really need in there is glow sight, I actually mostly run around with butchers bounty on because it helpful for farming mats for your food buffs.
---
Tenderizer in the charisma tree is broken, and I‚Äôd drop suppressor as well.  I‚Äôd go max 4 points in charisma.  
---
I‚Äôm not into Vats play with melee but if that‚Äôs how you want to roll then you do you.  
---
Also you want more luck, specifically as another poster mentions you will want serendipity, as well as starched genes.  To achieve this I‚Äôd lose some of your agility perks, don‚Äôt really see the point of gun fu, you one shot everything other than sbq and imp sheepsquatch as bloody unarmed, especially from stealth.
---
Keep dreamin bud.
---
Yh I like the in water purifier I hav 6 of the big ones 30 purifier water at a time
---
I said for the meat hook. Still id rather traveling pharmacy 3 Sturdy frame 2.
---
The stealth angle really puts the bloodied build over the top imho, once me and  my buddy switched to that from non stealth bloodied we noticed an immense change in damage output
---
Then am I doing something wrong? I build my current PC in early 2016 . With an fx8300 , 8 gbs of ram and a R9390 ( an upgrade from r7370 ) but still , its not having a nice time running fo4 not this . ( btw its on 1080 medium).
---
well, he's right that fo76 is just a copy and paste of fallout 4 with buggy multiplayer added
---
Yea sure, but it'd be cooler if the game functioned properly overall first.
---
üòÇüòÇ. I like watching people make there own fun in Fallout! You should do this https://youtu.be/SphU0TzQTuU üòÇ nice fun. I‚Äôve only just started playing so for me the game still has a lot to do but I can see it gets boring quickly if there is nothing to do
---
True that, for meat hook you need to sacrifice one of those perks, that‚Äôs absolutely correct
---
I use an Anti-Armor Lever Action. Sounds pretty pathetic when there are bloody and junkie builds running around, but after I do \~1000 damage on the queen and cripple her limb, I generally just focus on add control. Snipers are very well suited to add control when at a good vantage point, and it helps the heavies and melee do their jobs easier!
---
(Get those damn radscorpions in particular; shoot the stinger and give warning about their presence on voice chat so people can turn and gun them down quickly. I've seen radscorpions kill more poor bastards on that battlefield than any other type of creature.)
---
Is it just plain bad or stuttery?
---
Try updating to new amd drivers I was having a horrible time with my 5700 bad stuttering a poor frame rates in dense areas (performed worse or no better than the 480. Found GPU util wasn‚Äôt ramping up and new drivers solved it. 
---
Your rig should absolutely 100% deal with more than 1080p on this game.
---
Just looked at your ram hang on let me use overlay and see where my ram sits
---
U need ps plus
---
welcome to fallout 76 :)
---
That is something I hate about all of this . Im not shy from tech ( in the end I did piece this togethere) , but its plain bad , away from stutering and lag ( that is not on my end ) I dont know what should I do. I reinstalled drivers , cleaned it etc . But the problem persists , the only thing I think is left is to format the Hdd and reinstal the game . Now the reason im playing on 1080 is the monitor , soo no harm there but anything else is ran nicely  on the same resolution.  
---
Now I know that fx8300 is not a beast of a cpu by any measure , but come on this is not hard , I feel like Im not getting either the detail or frames I should be . ( at this point 30e well burned ).
---
Naw man. That's not pathetic. I dont care about junkies nor bloodied. Mainly because I refuse to compete for the weapons. I suppose my furious handmade does well enough. I get loot which is the important part. I just want to feel.more productive at it. I also focus on CC since I can one shot the adds, but also to get adrenaline up.
---
Just had a stomp around Charleston for you and ram hits 10gb 
---
Although this is on 4K and I only had 8gb 1600 ddr3 on my old rig and it was relatively ok at lower resolutions
---
His Christmas spirit yes i heard about what was going on, so i moved my robot to downstairs with my acid miner behind a keypad door. Thank god for meat week or else i would never have gotten the keypad door plan.
---
Pretty sure your fx is better than my old phenom. 
---
Tried frame rate target control. Sometimes the stuttering is solved by this for me. It‚Äôs in Radeon settings. 
---
Oddly if I scale my settings back I actually get worse stuttering as the drops are bigger in bad areas wish a higher initial frame rate.
---
Pretty sure plastering Facebook with pictures of the lover and sending the wife a link would cause some major damage!
---
The thing is im not really big on detail ( at least not at the moment ) , but is another 8gb of ram going to help anything , especialy at this point buying DDR3 ram does not seem like a nice idea.
---
Any idea what church?  I had no idea there was one you could build it
---
This idea bothers me also. We don't blame buildings that get broken into because they don't have brick proof windows and bars good enough to stop a torch. 
---
I have had systems which got many attacks per second. Even if you stop 99.9999% of the attacks it is still only a matter of time before someone gets in and no matter what exploit they used someone will say after the fact that you should have seen that and how obvious it is and it is completely your fault the system was broken into. 
---
Bethesda is responsible for what appears to be pretty poor security. However, the VAST majority of the responsibility for what is happening is on the people causing the problems. I really think we need a way to deal with those causing these problems.
---
I can already see camps full of porn pictures, not gonna happened.
---
If you were level 2, and with no clothes on, it might have been me.   
---
I removed all my armour and unequipped my weapons as a naked level 2 person was giving me the fear given the happenings immediately pre christmas. :)  
---
If you weren't level two, then ignore me, that was someone else :D
---
Probably not to be honest as I said mine was ok at 8 and I‚Äôm guessing yours is faster as mine is 6 years older. 
---
SSD makes a difference in any rig and can be pulled over to your new one. I got a Samsung QVO for less than ¬£50 recently in the sales and that‚Äôs not bad for 1TB. If your on euros even better for you as our currency is tosh.
---
Thank you NW.
---
Tbh I had an ssd since the PC was build , but 50 pounds for a terabyte ssd is a dream here btw. But really I cant put a 35gb game ( or in that class ) on a 120 ssd.
---
Agreed. I would love to be a ghoul player, and I would hope it would means rads are no longer a concern.
---
One should be able to tell real hacks apart from fear mongering, if the information comes from someone known to be an actual hacker (like ErectBan on the unknown cheats forum), and it is explained with code how exploit works, and is verified by known "white hat" hackers or data miners, then it should be taken seriously. That happened with the recent item spawning and stealing hacks. But anyone can make troll posts and videos with unsubstantiated claims to create hysteria.
---
If you vats and back out, itll disappear.
---
I was quite lucky grabbed it in clearance at a computer fair. Was only looking for 500 but it was a steal so upped it to 1TB. 
---
This is true. Well Sorry couldn‚Äôt be of any more help.
---
Wait, really?
---
BE tesla with charging shotgun barrel. You dont even have to charge it at all and it wrecks everything. The archy thing does way less dmg than explosive even the actual dmg numbers on pip boy may be close together
---
It would seem that you found the lair of The Grinch OP?
---
Not always, sometimes you still have to do a full scrap.
---
The one where you have to listen to a story from the Miss Nanny. That's all you do. It's stupid.
---
No, I expect journalists to do their job and examine things they write about. Even if that is just wishful thinking at this point
---
Oh my!  Lol
---
Oh man I love this idea. I've been playing since release and am really hitting a wall in this game. Sure I've gotten my money's worth but this is the first game I've played that the grind is totally 100% random and I'm tired of it. Weapons and armor are near impossible to aquire without buying many duped items, and even an outfit you want wont drop after literal thousands of hours of playing. I'd love a voucher system for literally anything in this game at all. They should add more items to the possum challenged while they're at it because I grinded those dailies until I had all the backpacks I want. Just give me some control over what I get...
---
So basically being a Ghoul is 100% positive? Oh wait a little less charisma.
---
Nuka zones. Pick flowers and kill enemies to get them. Need to stabilize flux at a workbench.
---
Really hasn't been much of anything added since the raids. A couple of seasonal events, one that ends tomorrow, and an unmarked fetch quest that ties in with wastelanders. No rewards... They haven't added shit other than fallout 1st and atom shop stuff.  Unless you just want to play, no real reasons to come back.
---
Yeah you can't tell me you can't run a wire through some shoddy wooden shack walls. Also there's a drill in the game so lore friendly lol.
---
What system is this d-bag on? It takes me about 15min to run a silo, and I have never seen a better target for  thermonuclear obliteration.
---
Haha what is this nonsense, is this whole reddit 12 years old ? This game fucks up everyday since release and people actually play it to these day and discuss the definition of terrorism...
---
Time to uninstall and get some fresh air mates, enough internet for me today.
---
Unless you are one of those whose endgame consists on building doll houses and playing dress up, no, there's nothing new.
---
Awh, yeah because i have the TSE tesla with shotgun barrel and thought it was doing damage till i tried project paradise and took so long to kill the Grafton monster was embarrassing. And i have the quad tesla good for pvp is awful for PVE and now I‚Äôm switching that  character unyielding. Want to make sure i go after the right gun before i start trading.
---
If you‚Äôre scared of running into things too high lvl, just stay in the forest zone for a bit. It‚Äôs a really big zone and most enemies are low lvl and spawn in manageable crowds. It‚Äôs a big region with plenty to see and do and by the time you‚Äôre done with it you should be able to explore both the toxic valley fairly comfortably. Keep your head up dude you can do it!
---
Basically, yes, and you'd be physically disfigured as well.
---
Maybe there could be a decrease in agility since Raul in NV always complaints about his knees. However a lot of veteran rangers in the NCR are ghouls and Raul still kick ass so I think it really depends.
---
Also do keep in mind that rads immunity means bloodied build would be ineffective for ghouls.
---
a huge no-no for me :/
---
It would be cool if your character automatically became a ghoul based on how many rads you had. Getting rid of your rads could maybe return you to normal. Bloodied builds would always be ghouls
---
Same. I really miss the pre-nerf (85 round) drum magazine.
---
Certain conduits go through ceilings perfectly. 
---
One points up one points down. Hook them together.
---
Its completly fine , I have something to think about atleast , but really I will probably just get a rx580 soon , and see if that makes any progres with my problem if not i might even go to ini files and disable everything I can . 
---
The only thing Im stumped on is that currently alot of things are running greatly , like apex lets say over 120 fps easly , soo this is a real head scracher.
---
The OP here is fake news, and there's a heap of unfounded, speculative and nonsense replies in this thread too.
---
19% or less to max out your stats.  Technically there‚Äôs one more tier of damage you can get with a bloody weapon, but after I hear nerd rage kick in, I feel good to go.
---
Breach and clear, because I got me plasma grenade plans now, I will NEVER do that broken boring event again . That goes double for load bearing. I will add a vote for dogwood die off, way to much running around for very little reward.
---
If I could just do a quick DitW every day, I absolutely would.  The other two feel like a waste of time.
---
This annoys me to no end, because I have no idea what the items true weight is and so when I attempt to put it in storage it is a guessing game. 
---
I wish I had a mule account but don't have any regular friends on this game who could transfer items.
---
This isn't staged and I know that kid.  
---
I don't want to do victim blaming, but I have met him many times and he usually goes around and attacks the first person he meets with the OP weapons and armors that his father gave him.  
---
In this case, the boy attacked the wrong person...  
---
I met him again days ago and he shot me as soon as he saw me for no reason.
---
When guns are being sold for 100k and up I'd say the market is already ruined!
---
Hahaha nope my toon is 17
---
I remember the good old days before food builds made it a restricted wasteland...
---
Hackers are doing us all a favour.
---
A game with a monthly subscription and no anticheat deserves to burn.
---
Some of the quest rewards aren't worth the caps to fast travel. You have to fast travel to the event... collect the reward... then fast travel to a vendor to sell what you don't want... then fast travel back to your camp... depending on the event but a few events the caps cost to fast travel cuts into what you made as a reward of the quest...
---
I have never tested it for bigger enemies but lvl 60 super mutants go down with one shot from a distance and without sneak attack. Pip boy gives energy dmg number around 500
---
Aww
---
Unfortunately, the only way to keep rogue turrets from killing your pets, is to get rid of them. Or put them in an area of your camp that blocks it from your pet's patrol path.
---
The other bug that often kills pets is when you load into your camp when starting the game:  If you have a pet, make sure you never log out of the game while in your camp... I generally log out of the game at a location nearby, so when I load into the game I can just walk to my camp. Most of my pet deaths occurred when loading into my camp when I start the game, until I got wise to this fact.
---
If you are in pacifist mode, you don't have to worry about other players killing your pet, so that just leaves Grahm... If your camp is along Grahm's path, know that there's a chance he will aggro towards your pet, if your pet has a red health bar (as opposed to white).
---
You‚Äôre kinda watering down your potential by dipping your toes into a bunch of weapon types.  If you just build completely towards rifles or heavy guns, it‚Äôs so much more efficient.  It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll ever run out of ammo using a Gatling gun.  May as well just max out heavy perks to give it maximum potential.
---
I wish enemies would drop the items they spawn with, which means legendary enemies should have legendary weaponry and armor equipped. It worked in FO4, why not here?
---
Ive opened like 60 presents and hour on most days, I have not received a single rare mounted plan and only 1 winter lights plan, otherwise its just been normal plans and prime receivers... Surely somethings going wrong here?
---
The holiday emotes do have a snow effect though

I'm sure they'll sell you the option in a new cosmetic subscription that lets you modify your appearance on the fly.

You asked for a link to a dragon build, here you go: [HW-Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f363e69&amp;d=sb0s01sq2s32sr2s22l22ls2lt2a80a04ic4s12ip2e60e50eh1ek1c71id2pm2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
No mutations selected, if you want/need them maybe skip some of the QOL picks like Vaccinated, Rejuvenated or maybe Bloody Mess. Luck of the draw is really great with HW imho, if you don't mind frequent repairs skip it.
---
Stabilized is a must have, works only in PA though - don't fight out of PA. 
---
I prefer to have at least 3 points in Cha and Per, so I can swap in lock picking, exterminator, glow sight, tenderizer, suppressor and hard bargain when needed or in group.
---
Because of ammo consumption you will want Ammo Smith and Super duper maxed out to craft.
---
You can already modify your appearance on the fly....
---
I kinda like the meelee build but I don't really have any good armor or things to counter the damage that I will have to take.
---
My bad replace the joke with whatever you feel is more appropriate then.
---
&gt;start on New Years' day.
---
&gt;someone tested it on me 
---
So the rumors that the Institute is skynet and that they do time travel is real? And you're a synth?
---
Or do you have any source/evidence?
---
No thank god
---
"I'm angry about fallout 1st"
---
What platform you on? If Pc id hold off for a while...
---
Theres a handmade that spawns in Berkeley Springs, on a metal shelf in a shack on a roof just west of the old church at the north. You can mod it and then scrap it if you want to farm for mods, but you‚Äôll probably have to do a bit of server hopping if you want it, I‚Äôve been there a few times and it‚Äôs already been taken.
---
"I'm happy to pay over the odds for nostalgia"
---
I think it's not necessary to put a mod on it before scrapping to learn any mod.
---
Ah is it not? Even better then!
---
source : dude trust me
---
This game closing down would probably be the best for everyone. It's not like they're going to ditch the Fallout IP anyways, seeing how fo4 and to a lesser extent fnv is still extremely popular. This game dying is the fastest way to get an actually good fallout experience.
---
Show the proof or shut ur pie hole.  Stop fear mongering.
---
Sorry wasn‚Äôt very clear, I built my own church
---
Ha!
---
I was 11 years old once too
---
I actually really enjoy the game but after FO1st it felt like an abusive relationship that I didn't want to be part of anymore.
---
As a full health player 19% just sounds crazy. I‚Äôm sure it just takes getting used to but it blows my mind.
---
Graham doesn't appear randomly, he's walking a particular route. You just run around randomly and intercept him sometimes.
---
Thank you I will try that next time.
---
Slapped silly lol I wish they had like a behemoth yao gui that you cld get a mount for that wld be a trophy.
---
You just place two conduits on the ground that are connecting where the wall will be and it will let you place a wall right on top of them
---

---
Yes. He has a video where he opens a bunch of presents. One is the baseball bat your looking for.
---
My biggest issue with how the events work is that you tend to "outgrow" some of them. Here's what I mean:
---
I like Tea Time and Feed The People when I start out with a new character. Tea time is a good way of getting to the south part of the Forest for free, plus it's a good source of XP and the tea, of course. But after getting to a certain level they're not much use anymore, and I'm more likely to do high level stuff.
---
To me it feels like they need to have more events, but separate them by levels. Of course, this obvious problem is that with only 24 people on a server, it's a limited player pool. The only way to solve this is to group people on servers by their level tiers, but that also comes with its own issues.
---
Sorry for the rant. To answer the OP question, all I can do is tell you the ones I never do. Dogwood is one of them. I like Project Paradise, but it's a waste of time since nobody ever shows up. I never, EVER do those horde ones, because I get sick of traveling all over the map to search.
---
Steel is in the middle of the dry lake just next to the workshop.
---
Yes it's nice so you can learn mods by building&amp; scrapping weapons if you just found the item's blueprints and have enough material.
---
I've noticed recently more people seem to be trading their BE in favour of a BFFR
---
If you haven't tried fo4, you should give it a shot instead, because to me, this game just feels like a worse version of fo4. Fo4's gameplay loop just worked, hell, I spent almost 2k hours on the game. 76's gameplay loop, on the other hand, feels very unsatisfying and tedious, because of the ridiculous ammo economy and the horribly balanced durability systems of the game.
---
Coming soon to FO 1st subscribers....Ghoul skins. 
---
You just have then another revenue stream. 
---
Found the Bethesda employee pretending to be a gaming fan.
---
It's not meant to be balanced.
---
You sacrificed the right of being human to gain these perks, it better have some benefits over negativities.
---
So no proof.  Got it.
---
Maybe it will bring 4 or 5 star enemies, being that powerful would get boring fast I hope it turns around for you.
---
Isn't there a spawn for the handmade schematic?
---
How do you transfer caps between characters on the same account on a private server without a 3rd party involved?
---
9 points into the heavy gun perks, then choose between some of the weight ones like Bear Arms (which is almost mandatory if you're going to cart around a pile of heavies). I use Traveling Pharmacy, but if you feel you can go without this, put Incisor in for your melee backup weapon.
---
Stabilized is mandatory, I think. After that, Intelligence is where you'll put perks that do things like make your energy ammo (i.e. fusion cores) lighter, and make the cores themselves last longer. TBH, I don't use those simply because I don't use VATS and don't rely on power attacks with my melee backup.  But these would be handy if you decide to go with a melee/heavy gun hybrid (i.e. just the three basic ranks of all heavy gun perks and all slugger perks).
---
A few more like Bloody Mess (Luck) and Adrenaline (Agility) would add some punch to your damage, then just go for whatever QoL you need. LW if you solo, Fireproof, maybe Ghoulish for nuke zones.
---
I should add that, I'm not a huge fan of the clunking sound my character makes in PA, and I hate the huge HUD. Both can be turned off, and you'll barely know you're wearing it if you are in FP view. But some people like the visceral feel of wearing PA...just my personal tastes.
---
3 week old account. Anecdotal evidence. Seems legit.
---
I'm fairly certain your toon being "killed off" wouldn't result in a picture of the ground with your toon not in it. That's not how pictures work.
---
What will you do of your computer crashed?
---
Restart.
---
So I'd imagine the server would be restarted as well, there is a chance that a restarted world would lose all of its progress so I don't know if this would work.
---
Project Paradise but only as a random event and make it into same thing as Encryptid requiring an item. Other events that can die off completely would be Back on the Beat, Death Blossoms, and Dogwood.
---
Course would be nice if turrets could do more damage.
---
Why not make camps instanced? No more issues with camp budget
---
OP posts a whole video. Video shows no direct evidence from the death to disconnect. Only a few instances of an immediate crash on attempt to join then a swap to a new character that works.
---
I would love this, but unlikely as it would give reason for people to ask for people to make the items instead of buying it from atomic shop. Take my thumbs up.
---
It's not a recent thing, people have been doing this for quite a while now to save some perk points.
---
Against a Bloodied build they are the same, and doesn‚Äôt have any negative effects for the user. 
---
Again, read the question I asked you. 
---
I can carry an Executioner‚Äôs FFR Deep
---
Dish Gamma Gun and have a silver bullet weapon against virtually every Bloodied build, without having to change my own build at all.
---
That's generally what I do as well. I have a decent selection of melee weapons (furious and instigating), so while I'm not going to be the guy carrying the fight on his back, I can sure cut through a mob of scorched, then pound on the the queen when she lands. It's not sexy, but it gets me by.
---
Yet. Quit giving them ideas xd. But no really there isnt one out that has any proof.
---
For base-builders, it would also be nice to have full control opt in/out like passifist mode. So that with it on, you can delete/move walls like it's your own camp
---
That could cause a permanent crash loop
---
This is true. I suppose I don't really know if it's the server or if it's connection based on my end. Its still annoying though.
---
O got mine at the vendor in Harper's ferry.
---
You‚Äôre spot on mate, I think the biggest issue with them is the sudden power creep that occurs post-level 50 which makes most of them feel lacklustre.
---
On the contrary though, I always do the horde events. Almost guaranteed 3 star, plus you can predict where most will spawn e.g. Super Mutant savage divide horde will be at West Tek, Cranberry Bog hordes will spawn at AMS headquarters etc. It does switch up rarely but 9/10 times it‚Äôll be the same place.
---
Nah, the turret might kill them and wanted players are a scarce and precious resource that should be preserved.
---
I bought all of the purchasable plans. And I think I managed to gets 22 in total number may not be exact cuz I did come across the plan for it more recently and I just dumped scrap into crafting them.
---
I believe its revive ally in water.
---
Nice! I swear I picked mine up in the world somewhere, I'll have to check Harper's today
---
It would make the most popular and most powerful build, Bloodied, a lot harder to maintain since you couldn't use rads to reduce your max health
---
Ooh perfect I‚Äôll try that then!
---
[But you can!!1](https://i.imgur.com/JdCd5xh.png)
---
I was just saying this the other night! A display case to show off the armor and skins I've collected
---
I'm pretty sure there isn't a patent pending so it's probably okay to reiterate the idea in the hopes it gains some traction which is what really matters yes? This is a good idea.
---
Would be cool but I can see them taking up a lot of camp budget like the weapon racks and display cases did
---
Yes I know the ultracite gatling laser has only 14 available mods however when scrapping some of them I did not get any mods for it. probably would have increase my chances if I had bothered to scrap the max level ones instead of the level 35 variant. Oh well it's what I get for being cheap
---
See I don't see it the same as Wow does have a win state by completing the current highest level raid currently available. Which takes absolutely perfect gear, v94 is tough on hard but it is mainly due to waiting on the terminals, not becaise of gear checks or extremely difficult bosses 
---
God I WISH this game had wow style raids with boss mechanics thst need to be learned. Having to not stand in the fire while trying to pump out top dps/hps/threat.
---
 When you have all the materials, remember to equip the contractor perk card.
---
Its 2500 caps u didnt have.   Sell it for whatever u want is my 2cents.
---
In case you didn't know, you can name the chassis.
---
soon the will be in the Atom Shop... without a doubt.
---
At the end I meant x 01 üòÇ
---
Increasing damage per hot also increases DPS, and if you only use rank 1 DE for BE you would still get 1% less dps than B25 weapons, so if you want more dps you need to have at least 2 points in DE.
---
It's not necessary to use DE but it's stupid not to if you choose BE over B25.
---
I logged in the other day and my missile turrets kept attacking my walls. The only thing that worked was deleting them and rebuilding them.  It was strange.
---
What makes you think they're stolen..? I collected over 150 this weekend.. may just be a fellow farmer.
---
This game needs some type of targeted loot.
---
Wait you can 
---
I ll check rn
---
&gt; Course would be nice if turrets could do ~~more~~ *any* damage. 
---
fixed
---
There‚Äôs certainly people out there that could hack the server side but they would care less about 76. Pretty sure we‚Äôre safe from this group figuring out a character delete.
---
I generally run around 10%. Below 5% is scary for me
---
my main is a Sneak/Crit/VATS build. i normally only use VATS and run commando cards. I run with whatever interesting VATS capable weapon i find. So I switch routinely between a large pile interesting 3\* 10mm pistols, shotguns, heavies, and "rifles" that I find or people don't understand the value of to a VATS build.
---
Shotguns and Heavies are hilarious in VATS with zero weapon perks.
---
For this reason, I keep all my Food, Meds, and Ammo on me at all times.
---
Kind of a pain having to scroll through all the items.
---
True! Heck if they would let you put them in the current display cases make them small. I struggle with camp budget as is lol
---
It does say ‚Äústolen gifts‚Äù on the camp.
---
Might not be true, but that‚Äôs why OP thinks they are stolen
---
That has so far not been a problem for me either.
---
Oh I thanks for the help 
---
I appreciate it
---
The sage has spoken.
---
I may be an idiot but I still have hopes for this games future.
---
&gt;displays that looked like picture frames but you could put your own pictures
---
So, something that looks like a picture frame and acts like one.... a picture frame maybe?
---
I know that, I've transferred all sorts of weapons over to an alt that way.  You were talking about transferring caps though. Is there some way to drop caps into a container that I've missed? I Didn't think you could drop caps on their own without trading.
---
Yes, this guy is very bad at math obviously. He‚Äôs off by about 13k XP.
---
There is always an addictol in the tattoo parlor where biv is. It‚Äôs in the desk of the tattoo shop
---
That‚Äôs what everyone said before the inventory hack
---
There's already a perk that heals health if you get rads, it's called ghoulish
---
I'm well aware aha. I am just here for the drama. I just think the proof given wasnt sufficient yet. Showed a new bug. Didnt prove hack.
---
I hadn't thought about that, but you're right...there is always a logical spot for certain enemies to spawn. Maybe I should try these for the legendary swag. Every have trouble with someone else getting to the boss and killing it before you get there?
---
I always assumed it was a scorch beast nest or something
---
Hello fellow alchie
---
I like having options. I also prefer PC over Mac.
---
I just dropped twisted muscles and talons a couple of days ago. The only downside was my aim was a little off, otherwise they weren't hurting any. Even adding eagle eyes doesn't seem to have made aiming THAT much better.
---
That bug has been with us since B.E.T.A.
---
It was supposed to be fixed a few patches back; if they did it was reintroduced shortly after.
---
One reason why I 'parked' my BE Tesla.
---
I upvoted because I thought it was real ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Agreed, having the option to rejoin a map or join a new would be great. Unfortunately there probably isn't an incentive for this being it's a paid feature of Fallout 1st.
---
kek
---
Some like me enjoy the privacy of 1st, I never liked the multi player aspect and do enjoy having a Fallout 4 version of Fallout 76.
---
Looks cool as hell though.
---
Yeah, but he has the vocal cadence of Kermit the Frog.
---
I won't say it's just you but it's not me. After level 150 or so I was to the point where I had zero trepidation about fast traveling anywhere on the map.
---
I know smart boi, it doesn't neglect rads so it's pretty useless.
---
If I were a Bethesda employee why would I post it as a suggestion on reddit instead of just working to implement it? Also if I'm a Bethesda Employee I wouldn't be giving "them" a revenue stream, I would be giving myself one. Nothing about your comment makes any since.
---
Ghoul Slayer‚Äôs Gamma Gun. 
---
I keep getting these stupid things.
---
The Tattered Field Jacket is uber rare
---
&gt; Apparently there‚Äôs a script in the works that will remove your essential flag and basically mark you as an NPC and allow you to be permakilled.
---
Sounds like purest bollocks, a total misunderstanding of how the game works.
---
Get ready fans for ¬°Ghoulified! You've asked and we have listened only 5,000 atoms! (Please note this 24 hour skin is non transferrable, and will expire upon armor breaking, removal of armor, and death.)
---
They only become wanted if your collector is locked and they pick it.
---
I have to admit....I've taken a couple gifts myself if the collector is unlocked.  But then again my water purifiers and junk collector are unlocked so I figure it all evens out.
---
Really?  I have one of those! Do u want it?
---
I have a strong feeling that these will be some of the locations that become populated when wastelanders arrives. Any locations that have a lot of scorched seem likely.
---
They probably haven't looked at it since they marked some disable flags some 14 months ago.
---
Pretty sure it also prevents other players from scanning the horizon and seeing you
---
I personally think this is a great idea. At the moment those vending machines are a useless waste of space.
---
Hmm, a static addictol spawn in the same location where you get all your alcohol recipes and your brewing station. It's almost like they knew what they were doing. Lol. I grab that thing every time I go there for his daily repeatable quest. As a result I've got at least 30 did my stash so that whenever the consume alcohol quest come up I just drink all 10 at once, pop an addictol, and go on with what I was doing.
---
No, it was all there when I logged in.
---
In other news, you're less likely to have these issues on console. Film at 11. I have the PC version and a console version, i've gotten more used to going to the console just because I know someone is out there with nothing better to do. It's pathetic and sad, but it's a thing.
---
Lol, downvoted because I‚Äôm having fun with my son by using mechanics that are in the game?? Mad because someone picked your Santatron or just opened it because it wasn‚Äôt locked? But the same people will dupe and use XP exploits.
---
zoinks! scoob, then our gaming pcs would be 5 thousandr dollur papur waits!
---
Moving to UE or Unity wouldn't fix anything. Gamebryo is fine, it's Beth that ran it into the ground. They'd do the same thing with any other engine basically. You can see that with FO76, issues over issues, even a year after release.
---
And yes, they could make UE or Unity as modable as Creation Engine, it's not that hard really. While at it, they could make an actual well-working scripting language, instead of the snail that Papyrus is.
---
Easy solution: makes vouchers tradable. Market forces will adjust accordingly.
---
The engine base is fine, Beth ran it into the ground though. Be it for lack of experience, talent, or time, but they did.
---
I'd be very cautious in calling things stupid.
---
Explosive damage modifier changes the projectile type. How exactly various legendary effects perform is dependent on their projectile type (i.e. at some point silencers negated 50% critical bonus damage effect). Against properly explosion-proof players, the bare damage from 1* bloodied weapons quite often exceeds the combined damage of the "ballistic" portion of explosive shots as well as the explosive AoE itself. B10 definitely outperforms BE when it comes to damage dealt by freehand aiming. The firespeed also influences critical hit frequency (per time), and allows you to "prolong crits" which means that multiple bullets go out critical per single spent crit because RNG reroll for shooting has larger interval than your shots have. Overall, the firerate provides 30-40% actual DPS advantage in PvP compared to explosive, but unlike explosive, it doesn't let you learn where the hidden opponent is, which is my use case for explosive weapon usage. Wasting more than 2 points (for total of 3) on intelligence for perfected powerbuild - that would be stupid.
---
So now people are just attacking the player base for no reason other than to hurt the game's popularity? Or they're lying about attacks? Hope they're making a lot of Youtube bucks on this shit.
---
It‚Äôs a Fixer, so it‚Äôll have some demand, but Berserker‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a particularly desirable effect. It can be ok, but very few players want to run at 0 DR. As such, I would‚Äôve put that in my vending machine for 1000 caps and fully expected to eventually turn it in for scrip‚Äîso if you got 2500, you did well for yourself.
---
Dont they do this with the vault raids, instead of vouchers though its called bulk ammo scrap or something.
---
Look here Verdic, he is very kind and to try and judge my parenting on taking gifts out of a robot collectron from a game shows you‚Äôre obviously not a parent or you don‚Äôt see the whole picture. Judge my parenting on game designed to kill others and other things, but take an unopened santatron gift and you‚Äôre depressed? So murder in a game is okay, but taking unlocked presents is bad? Idiot
---
Are you using VATS? I one tap nearly everything up to level 68 super mutants with shotguns with zero shotgun perks.
---
I got a bloodied limb dmg Tesla. I love it when I‚Äôm solo running into large mods. I targets legs to cripple them all cause I‚Äôm a bit sadistic like that haha.
---
In short Tesla doesn‚Äôt have a big need with vats as u can just spray and pray.  One with faster reload always a plus
---
The only idiot I see here is the individual thinking that his parental actions with his child not having unintended consequences when choosing to teach them that the people they steal from aren't "real people" and it therefore causes no negativity in someone elses life. I think the idiot is on the other side of the table my friend.
---
Photo mode ftw, great for hiding and then zooming out
---
The more control you have, the less time you will spend on the game, and the less money. It's a shitty, but totally pragmatic approach. It uses gamification to keep you playing/paying, but not with a high enough reward that you might actually become sated and content,  and leave.
---
There‚Äôs some weird underground ones too
---
Like I wanted to believe his math but no matter how many times I do it I think it's wrong. Not trying to be rude about it I just think he figured it wrong. I keep coming up with 27k
---
I can get conduits to work fine. so user error?
---
Banks are actually insured since they do get broken into no matter how good their security is. No matter how hard they work on security they still get broken into. We have had people break into banks for hundreds of years and even with all that experience we still can't prevent the attacks. 
---
Software changes much faster and we don't have very good experience for doing a good job with that. Even things like best practices are constantly being updated and changed. Even something as simple as password policies have completely changed just in the last 5 years. We went from simple passwords to complex requirements to the dropping of those requirements and going for longer and simpler passwords.
---
I agree that Bethesda should do much better but I also know that the absolute state of the art is not that good and the more interactive you make a system the harder it is to secure it.
---
They might. For a modest fee of 6000 atoms.
---
If you haven't already, snag the Clean Striped Suit from Twitch Prime Loot, if still available. It looks amazing with the white wolf fedora and suppressed handmade. It's my favorite outfit now.
---
It's an easter egg that has been scattered throughout the games, without ever having had a backstory given.
---
I‚Äôve done solo the entire way and I‚Äôm a level 96 (not sure how many hours). I haven‚Äôt done a silo or vault mission however. I‚Äôm not sure how that would end up, but I‚Äôve had plenty of other things to do to keep me occupied, so I haven‚Äôt given the difficulty much thought.
---
Pc?
---
I mean, you can, it just costs money and law might not allow it ;)
---
Actually an online game isn't that hard to secure against these kinds of hacks. There are a finite number of types of packets, those can be handled in certain ways. Sure, there can be oversights, but again, it's not like FO76 has a great track record so far.
---
I think you should stop seeking revenge.
---
Inventory hack is real, but client just CAN'T delete character information from servers. This is technically unreal
---
They‚Äôre great. Raiders are part of the lore. An RPG with no meaningful NPCs and where everyone is nice and chummy wouldn‚Äôt be much of a game. If you don‚Äôt like how others choose to role play, may I suggest Farming Simulator?
---
I'm still trying to get my turrets to stop attacking my own stuff.
---
Both legitimate aspects of the game that have been in since beta. If fact if your camp gets destroyed by someone its 100% your fault for allowing it.
---
These camps were cool a few months ago, but now I don't even bother to take a look at them anymore, to be honest. I've been playing this game for 7 or so months and I've never found anything interesting or cheap on the vendors of any of these 'secret' camp I've bothered to check, and I've checked a lot...
---
Also, perception increases the range at which you can detect enemies, not VATS accuracy. The biggest factor for accuracy in VATS is the range of the weapon.
---
And yes, banks are insured. But a bank that has basically no secured won't be insured, or at least not for long.
---
So I guess the moral of the story is that we should make game companies pay for any damages (including lost playtime). So they find insurance for it, and the insurer will require certain criteria to be met before they give their OK.
---
Love this!! This is what community is about, help and support.
---
Most of my mates don't pay anymore so I frequently find myself jumping round the map following lowbies and helping them out. 
---
Honestly entertains me more watching strangers communicate thru emotes and gunshots for directions :p
---
My launcher never logs me out
---
Oh yea. Just not too much
---
Meanwhile I'm running around in full Santa costume and giving gifts I picked up, to people I meet
---
Those are people who enjoy playing the role of a raider usually or griefers. The ones who play the role of a raider will take your workshop to actually use it for its resources as they usually have a group that they all share their resources with. 
---
Some roader gangs are nice people who all help each other out but if that means stealing a workshop then they steal the workshop. 
---
Griefers are in it just to get on your nerves. A good sign is if they kill you at your workshop but don't fully capture it from you they are waiting for you to come back and retake it so they can try to kill you again. 
---
Now if they are attacking your camp then they are obviously griefing you just to get on your nerves.
---
It's caps you made for something you didn't want.  That's a win.  I love how many people run bloodied because when I get a drop of one I know it's guaranteed caps.
---
It's only a video game
---
I'm fine with it. You get a pop-up message warning you about the risk of PvP when claiming a workshop. If you die, you won't die again if you don't seek revenge. It's not that big of a deal.
---
While the game is designed with a modicum of resource scarcity, by and large nearly everything you need can be gotten by simply going forth and gathering it.  You simply exchange time for materials.  
---
The trap is if you played FO4 where you **needed** to take everything you found, in this game that habit actually punishes you because the scarcest resource is *STORAGE SPACE*.  Between that and your limited carry weight, managing what you take, what your carry, and what you store is a delicate balance.  
---
There are really rare materials, are endgame items like Hardened Mass, High Radiation Fluids, Flux, and Vault Steel.  You will eventually come to recognize and tag ingame what specific materials your playstyle requires as well, and will learn what to take and what to pass by.  
---
For example ballistic players tend to seek out and grab lead and acid, for ammunition.   Energy players tend to nab crystal and fiber optics.  Most players end up needing plastic and ballistic fiber in moderate quantities.  But how much of you need will depend on how much you find yourself going through.
---
In the end, one of the ways to help mitigate the 'hoarding' tendency that players display, is Bethesda's Fallout First subscription, which I won't judge here- but does offer as one of its benefits, the ability to store nearly endless scrap.  You may eventually find that worthwhile in the future, but as you're starting out, you should be able to find a playable balance just between foraging and storing in your Stash box.  I hope that this is helpful for you!
---
Honestly, is it worth renewing?   I haven't noticed all that many benifets aside from the scrap box thing. And I mean, your own server is nice, but it makes having player stores set up kinda useless.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean just griefers who want to kill you and don‚Äôt take your settlement. Exactly what I mean.
---
It‚Äôs a game about survival in the wastelands post nuclear apocalypse. I think it makes a ton of sense that some people would role play as Raiders and steal your shit as often as they can. 
---
The previous games had NPCs as Raiders, and they were PROGRAMMED to try and kill you.

In other words, try to remember it‚Äôs a game. Try to remember that not everyone plays the game the same way as you. It‚Äôll be more fun hopefully. If not, you can always play Fallout 4 by yourself!
---
Oh, I hardly ever use VATS.
---
Some players just get enjoyment out of destroying others enjoyment.
---
Same face appeared in Fallout 4 in the bottom of the water shaft in Dunwich Borers. It's often supposed to be a reference to the Elder Gods of H.P. Lovecraft lore.
---
What thing
---
That‚Äôs for the swimming badge, the kindness step is just a regular revive.
---
They don‚Äôt need to do that to cause permadeath, they simply need to unflag ‚Äòessential‚Äô ‚Äòprotected‚Äô status from player characters and then kill them - result being permadeath and thus inability to respawn. Very doable based on what they‚Äôve already managed to achieve.
---
Most of the time I don‚Äôt even pick up a weapon so it‚Äôs not an issue. Tan skinned character with brown hair. If it looks like a bush and acts like a bush I must be a bush.
---
&gt; Every have trouble with someone else getting to the boss and killing it before you get there?
---
Ahh mate don‚Äôt get fucking started lol half the time it isnt even a player it‚Äôs just another creature, but that happens more when it‚Äôs a mole rat or ghoul horde. Muties and cave crickets can hold their own.
---
Good to know I haven't tried shotguns or heavy weapons  in VATS
---
Best one is just use the laying down photo mode pose, no way in hell they will be able to spot you.
---
If we could display our PA, itd just be one more thing I couldn't do because of build spaceü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Now I am a raider I guess you could say but I don't just walk around trying to initiate PvP with every player I come across. I'm more of a Robin Hood type raider. I try to help out those being griefed by the players who take more of an approach like The Joker. 
---
One thing I got good at was finding a griefers camp and dropping a nuke on it to force them off the server. Usually works. Some don't care if their camp gets utterly destroyed though :/
---
Always always always post your console when asking other people to play with you. 
---
Also this is basically a trade request post and will most likely get removed by the mods.
---
If you go with an energy weapon, then the beer you want is High Voltage Hefe. Same effects, just energy damage. Good luck my friend.
---
Same - I found an anti-armour handmade and use that as my general secondary for mobs or other oh shit moments. It‚Äôs semi-auto so I get the benefit of the rifleman perks etc
---
Works well with the SBQ, though while you‚Äôll pull your weight you‚Äôre not going to come close to those heavy weapon dps builds
---
I guess I don‚Äôt understand the problem. 
---
If you leave your purifiers or extractors or santatrons unlocked how is it stealing?  
---
If you don‚Äôt want people helping themselves then lock them up and quit your bitching
---
Ye,I ain‚Äôt the best at doing anything but reading reddit,&amp; thanks fer the tip.
---
I was actually lookin fer you,But didn‚Äôt wanna be annoying,Lol
---
I found some chick selling the outfits fer 500 caps per piece,but I‚Äôm not that wealthy with caps.
---
You can also do this for other armor and weapons. 
---
A trick I (and others) use is to rename an item to have a number at the beginning so that in the default alphabetical order it shows up first. 
---
I prefix all my Power Armor with a ‚Äò0.‚Äô and then the name I want to give it (like, ‚ÄòScabavator‚Äô or ‚ÄòT-51 Nuka Cola‚Äô, for example). These always show at the top of my inventory or stash.  I also keep 2-3 chassises with ‚Äòspare parts‚Äô and rename them accordingly. And sometimes I‚Äôll put together a low level PA set to help out a new player, and rename that one to make sure I drop the correct set. 
---
Chest pieces are prefixed with 1., Arms are 2., Legs are 3., Underarmors are 4., my preferred outfit pieces are 5., and Atom Challenge related clothing (like a Responder‚Äôs outfit or Clown Suit/Hat are 6.  I also do that for my specialty gear (like my Troubleshooter‚Äôs set for silo runs)
---
Same idea for weapons. 1. for my mains, 2. for my backups. 
---
It also makes it easier to recognize new gear for either selling or scrapping.
---
There is a limit to how many items you can rename; I hit that the other day but realized I had way more renamed than I needed. I believe the maximum is 50.

Now that sounds like a good idea. Give the stuff an actual value with actual damages and companies will take this into account as a cost of doing business and improve standards.
---
It only shows +2 on my screen.
---
Came to say Messenger as well - So much this....it‚Äôs fun to do the first time when your low level but man it takes way too long for the interaction quality with the event.
---
Fallout 1st lets you do that I think
---
I think I should reword the post. I mean people who purposely initiate pvp with you and don‚Äôt take your settlement. People who literally only want to piss you off.
---
I don‚Äôt know where he got the extra 13k from because I did the math too and only came up with 27,001.
---
For several weeks now. Either start with whatever character you were using last or quit out of the game, either way, next time you see the menu the character select option will be there.
---
This game is trash and you‚Äôre trash for supporting it
---
I might as well not be wearing armor. Lower level enemies just shred me to pieces now. After 45 levels of never dying, I log in after a break, and I die three times to a single random enemy at my level. Three armor pieces broken.
---
And this was a complete set of heavy leather armor against a robot shooting energy weapons, for which leather is an optimum armor.  
---
Also seeing the increased hunger and thirst.
---
Anyone try just making fresh armor?
---
They can't hurt you if they disintegrated before noting your presence, you've given a honest description of bloodied playstyle
---
üëç was just curious. Thanks for confirming.
---
Census Violence is funny though so I‚Äôd argue that should stay - tea time is good for low levels and to get some rad ants.
---
Dogwood is brutal so definitely that, the Messenger as well.
---
If you are on PC restart both the launcher and game client.
---
It seems if you leave you device on, and go away for a while and get signed out, the charecter selection option dissappears.
---
Anything displayed should not be counted towards stash budget. At least that‚Äôs my opinion LOL.
---
There are people like that in real life. So yes I‚Äôd expect to find them in an online game as well.
---
I meant like your computer hosts players, not renting a private server
---
I already completed rare "paints" guns collection (all 3 rare baseball bats + Gilded Minigun), but looks like I need to search for another rare weapon for my collection - Gilded .44 ;)
---
Your incredibly sporadic reaction says a lot about your feelings on the subject so it's clear we're at an impasse. But yeah, I am a parent and I dont teach my kids to steal from other people. (or murder other people for that matter). I don't do the PVP thing, and I teach my kids not to as well. We play it as a PVE game, and we're happy with that. I prefer not to cause harm to others - too much of that going on in the world as it is. Clearly we fall on opposite sides of the line. Though your underlying anger at the insinuation is clearly more than you can handle. I hope you have a better rest of the day - but i'll be blocking you from here.
---
Too cheap?  Give me a break. 
---
I‚Äôve sold god tier weapons for less than that.  
---
Right now the market is flooded with legendaries for sale and a side effect of cashing in presents is sometimes you get scrip.  Not to mention legendary scorched dropping shit everywhere. So you can load up fairly quickly with or without the daily limit. 
---
I‚Äôm more annoyed at people that overprice their shit.  I price my stuff to sell because I have to.  I‚Äôm sitting on almost 200 large presents and my vendors are chock full of good stuff for less than asking price. 
---
You only have 1000 scrip and 30000 caps.
---
It's 20h cooldown
---
20 hours after you first interact with it
---
It's sad to see people like this. I hope you have a better day.
---
I see people saying that everyone else would have to load it for that to work, but I feel liked that skips over obvious solutions like having the pictures only being client side. Maybe you can see the pictures in your groups base if you‚Äôre a part of the group.
---
Thanks guess I‚Äôll stay overweight then !
---
Dont a Hack, I just deleted the Game, that is my perma death.
---
Exactly I'm already here go away boomer
---
Yao guis and mirelurk kings are far more powerful than deathclaws.  I can drop one in 6-7 shots easy.
---
Thanks!
---
If you make a habit of scarfing up Shotgun ammo, you can generally find a useful 2\*/3\* shotgun with +50% VATS critical for under 2000 caps. With the event running, doing big bend, galleria, etc, I've had to start dropping stacks of 500 shotgun shells, as I collect more shotgun ammo then I use.

Fallout 4 had the Pip-Boy companion app that was awesome.  I nerdily even bought the phone adapter for ps4 and attached it to my controller.  Granted this was on console, but, the code was there at least.
---
Clients shouldn't be able to effect other client's inventories either, but that happened. Whether the method of permadeath is actual character deletion or some other method that still renders the character unplayable, insisting that it *can't* happen doesn't really mean a whole lot when we've already had a hack that shouldn't have happened.

Its a Bethesda game. I would be more concerned and less likely to believe you, if you claimed it was NOT crashing.
---
It's basically a "founder" title. I can dig that.
---
Just wait till you kill a 3 star legendary to have them drop a 1 Star lead pipe.
---
Also when holding a weapon aiming down makes you shorter so you can hide better.   Kinda like the fetal position. :)
---
What you just wrote sounds like medieval ravings of uncircumcised peasants about how space is arranged.  Sorry, but it's really rubbish.
---
It doesn't seem like it's that hard of a challenge. I only played NW for one day, about 10 hours worth, and I unlocked the first 4 items and got just over 3k of the 7k xp needed for the beanie.
---
That sounds incredibly dissapointing.
---
Equip the Green Thumb card to get twice the Flora as well.
---
Next your going to expect no bias or maybe atleast fairness beyond the corporate best interests. The real world hurts, and videogame jouralism is just the stary of the shit.
---
Sociopathic is correct. They're experiencing schadenfreude. An excessive amount of it. They're sociopaths plain and simple. It's a shame this is so very rampant in games in general. They really do show you who someone is when they don't feel there is any consequences to their actions.
---
A search in this subreddit history actually shows some posts from a year ago with the same question so it‚Äôs been more than several weeks haha. I‚Äôd never notice it since I only play with one character. 
---
But yes, it‚Äôs easily fixed by restarting the game it seems like.
---
As someone that owns several decent handmades (including a primed auto B25 FFR and primed auto BE) it‚Äôs more about what a trade can bring you in return.  I don‚Äôt need more caps.  Rare armor would be the ticket and 90% of players don‚Äôt have something I‚Äôd want
---
Of course you won‚Äôt address the murder aspect. It‚Äôs official folks, taking gifts is BAD but killing animals and people is okay. Your judging my parenting based on in game mechnics shows that you lack even a remote level of understanding of what I am telling you. It‚Äôs anger because you judged my parenting because in real life you‚Äôd get popped in the face. You may play it as a PVE game but we don‚Äôt always. Get Fallout 1st like we did if you want to avoid these situations.
---
So, we call it out. Which is what this thread is about
---
When you learn a plan it disappears
---
How much you gonna pay up?
---
The turrets watched the enemies attack my base when I was level 30, but had white springs gouls at my base and the enemy‚Äôs didn‚Äôt fight back they continued whacking my expensive stuff. They knew my stuff is more valuable then my life! (Then a few updates later fixing the gouls to no longer have an agenda to make life hell for base owners now my turrets (especially the ones which don‚Äôt need power) randomly shoot at the Brahmin (fertilizer thing), the Santa tron and ground
---
What does having an intact dick have to do with this?

I wonder when the next two are going to drop ü§î

Interesting. Everything I've seen scrolled on the screen that was a plan was in my pip-boy notes tab to learn.

I use * but most symbols should work

Platform?

If you're on PS4 I can sell you a bunch :)
---
This has been around for a while. There are several popular areas in the world players will do this. Just hope they don't leave or crash while you're in there as it will usually result in you falling to a death.
---
 
---
Being a Protectron:
---
* Immune to rads
---
* Immune to diseases
---
* Cannot heal with Stimpaks or Perks
---
* Cannot use guns, melee weapons, or armor
---
* Can only be repaired at workbenches or Repair Kits
---
* Cha +5 (Who doesn't love a Protectron?)
---
* Plans to discover new upgrades a la "The Mechanist"
---
* Vault Steel and Legendary Modules for specific Legendary Upgrades
---
* Initial stats would carry 35% Damage Reduction, +150 Carry Capacity, HP calculated as 500 + (Endurance \* 7) with Upgrades changing values later
---
* Hotkey on Favourites Wheel for Canned Chatter or a built in modulator on voice chat.
---
These are the shenanigans I'd be game for.
---
Only if you don‚Äôt like lead pipes
---
I've seen a .44 before. The player who got it told me it was a quest/event reward. I've never been able to find much information or confirmation on how to obtain them though.
---
There's a running theme in 76 where the giant heads are located in places of great power.  I think the insinuation is that they are all linked, in a cultish Illuminati-type fashion, to the thing that resides in Lucky Hole Mine.
---
It's why I don't take workshops.
---
time to cllin an orbital strike...
---
Oh shit, that is sharp! I'll have to give it a go!
---
Depends on the persons build realy
---
Here for the answer too. 
---
I never gave it much thought. I know pvp damage is capped at 110 but does assassins give 10% more?
---
LHM has one too, near the interloper
---
Now that there is a damage cap per hit Assassin prefixes don‚Äôt help as much. What people seem to want in pvp is quad faster fire rate type weapons. 
---
I don‚Äôt pvp so I‚Äôm sure someone will either clarify off my post or give you a better answer, but in general I don‚Äôt think Assassins weapons are highly sought after anymore.
---
Dogwood and Tea Time i can agree with along with Death Blossoms
---
i'm noticing a lot of people saying "The Messenger". i love that event, i go to almost all of them just to stock up on stimpacks
---
welcome to Falloff 7shit. Where this was report since day 1 and never was address.
---
I would like an answer to that too. Good question.
---
I probably would have had a difficult time moving it for that price, so I wouldn't be that concerned about it.
---
Berserkers is good for running Nuke Zones in a HazMat suit, depending of course upon the secondary and tertiary effects.
---
This is what annoys me, they probably don‚Äôt add hairstyles because people don‚Äôt buy them, and people don‚Äôt buy them because WHO WANTS A FUCKING BEEHIVE HAIRSTYLE THAT SHIT IS STUPID AS FUCK. I like hanging up my girls hairstyle a lot and putting on different outfits and I only have like 3 styles that look cute on her.
---
I‚Äôm not going to be online until this evening but my Gt is Astrosguy so you can add me and keep an eye out!
---
The same thing happend with a dense plan I recieved (leather chest I believe) but it didn't show up in my inventory. It
---
Lets hope it does. Yeah it does get boring.
---
 I stayed away from bloody builds and melee builds because of how powerful they can be. 
---
 I figured a full health non automatic rifleman would be a safe bet for a challenge given how powerful other builds are.
---
 Turns out I can hit for 2-3k damage anyhow, 4-5k if I switch to my pipe rifle build.
---
Assasins is garbage on weapons. Pretty much everything else is better.
---
I wonder if it gets buffed in Wastelanders to 30 pct damage to humans? (Players and npc's).
---
Even then tier 1 effects are still superior.  Hopefully they look at all the perks and legendary effects with the update.
---
I did,maybe if ya got the time,ya can throw me a message here!?!
---
Cause I don‚Äôt have a ton of time too check,&amp; I usually let my kids watch shows,as my Xbox is my ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù console.
---
Regardless,I‚Äôm def gonna try.
---
Hopebya had a blast at Cher game last night,
---
&amp; hope too catch up at some point.
---
I remember being downvoted into the Vaults trash compactor for saying that is how a human raider would be. I tend to just steal resources and run.
---
Yeah, that's cool and all, but if someone told me that another player could just look at you and erase your entire inventory, I'd have assumed that was rubbish, and it obviously wasn't.
---
I generally melee ground based things, but even at L161, yogis and 91 deathclaws get the AA LMG.
---
Sounds about right.

Made a little something for the poor fella...
---
I had this problem until I renamed all my chasis'
---
The fact that so many players keep so much of their junk on them is one reason this happens. 
---
Yes, there are some that do it ‚Äòjust for the lulz‚Äô. But more often, I think, it‚Äôs a risk/reward consideration. 
---
Think of it this way: if there was an event (*let‚Äôs name it ‚ÄòThe Prize is Right!‚Äô*) in the game that gave you the chance to gamble and risk 50 caps, with the possible results being: A - losing those caps or B - getting those caps back plus more caps (up to double your money) *and* potentially a few hundred pounds of free scrap material, would you participate in that event if it showed up on the map?
---
Yea I use the all rise on lesser creatures.I'm not a big melee guy this is the first fallout i ever used one other than the first time I did the family quest in new vegas and tried out the shishkabob.
---
Very true. I personally like how neat and organized my list stays using numbers. 
---
But whatever works for each individual is cool. 
---
üëçüèº
---
Sounds like when you opened the packages you immediately ate what‚Äôs in them. Do you recall seeing any other plans and can you also locate them?ü§î
---
If they're unlocked, I consider it a gift on their behalf.
---
I've had the most luck using anti-armor with faster firerate automatic rifles. Specifically the handmade, combat rifle, or fixer.
---
Reticle still turns red, regardless of your position. Anyone who knows what they're doing, is scanning hiding spots with their reticle, not trying to spot people in bushes.
---
Same, if anyone has this in there vendor please let me know, i am on PC :)
---
More like Alpha phase 2 testers since we still get core gameplay bugs that shouldnt have existed since Fallout 4.
---
Thanks MadHam. I have roughly a few hundred plans that say ‚Äú(Known)..‚Äù and still hang in my notes section. Are these just duplicates or should they be vanishing? Never knew they left once you read them! My plasma problem though is after the plan listed in the scroll on the left, when I went into my notes to actually read the plan it wasn‚Äôt there. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm getting confused. Is it possible to earn a plan but due to a glitch ‚Äòauto‚Äô learn it? I just would trust it more to have physically seen the plan in my inventory and clicked ‚Äòread‚Äô than just see the gift scroll on the left.
---
I dont pvp very often, and have never thought to waste my time with Assassins. But this was what I thought the answer would be. 
---
I hope there is a lot more than just new questlines with Wastelanders. I hope we start to see the 5* Legendaries, and new perks/modified perks and legendary effects. I have an Assassins explosive fr LMG that I would be curious to try if I thought Assassins was worth it. Maybe I‚Äôll hold onto it until Wastelanders to see if it gets buffed. 
---
Thanks.
---
Probably was part of the buildings design and all the metal and shit was placed around it.
---
If they are taking a workshop they have a reason, even if it is alien to you.
---
I would not think of workshops as settlements, think of them as PvP zones.
---
As far as people destroying your base over and over the only way this is possible is if you keep accepting to pvp with them.
---
Just like infinite storage wouldn't work in the game but magically it does now behind a pay wall ü§î I do agree with you though I don't think the game can handle it
---
You can clear the mobs for the heavies and then use up your Vats criticals on SBQ headshots. Thats usually my strategy. If someone throws down a survival tent it's even better for surveying the battlefield.
---
 this is called a metaphor
---
THIS. This all day long. If snowflakes can‚Äôt handle their stuff getting stolen, put a lock on it. It takes MINIMAL resources. QUIT BITCHING. LOCK YOUR SHIT.
---
Yes, it's just a decorative architectural element sometimes found on Art Deco buildings as well. It reminds me of Metropolis's original [poster](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/36/5e/77/365e7709ba096fcad6011f94f9874b3f.jpg).
---
They had this available in counter strike 1.6, when internet was awful. 
---
You can load image data slowly at a lower priority than necessary data.  Your graphics card already does this with texture data anyways.
---
Unfortunately players will burn through the quests quickly and then be bored. Hoping like you that more grindable content is added. New ranks in Ever Upwards would be great. I would also love to have faction systems that work the same as the scout quests. Earn commendations through challenges that allow you to buy cosmetics and faction related stuff.
---
My tip #1, as a bush hunter; to not wear a ginormous bear/mascot, head while trying to hide in bushes. 
---
I don't care how good you think you look in it. We can see that a mile away.
---
Glad it‚Äôs not just a me thing. Sounds like it may have worked in our favor!
---
**HA!** they can barely fix the bugs in the current game imagine the bugs that would happen with this implementation? I too would love to see this... they can make it happen with the loading screens i don't see why they can't make it possible.
---
You probably did learn accidentally, if the plan is known it is a duplicate. U can check if you already know the plasma grenade plan if you get another one to check it if it's known or not
---
How about a universal texture? So it only shows your pictures to yourself and nobody else?
---
One good reason to buy 1st and claim workshops on private servers!! PvP is part of the game but I'd rather fire up CoD(or any other PvP game infact) and play PvP there. That's just one of the reasons I like 1st!!
---
FYI,
---
I‚Äôve gotten 4 of them and all from medium gifts. I have everything now but the deathclaw and the MQ claw. 
---
Good luck finding what you‚Äôre after!!
---
Also I‚Äôve found a lot of the PA come from the small gifts.
---
I don't really care about the ghoul player stuff, but I definitely would like to see the ability to have different origins. Like having a player originate from the vault or coming from somewhere else outside and going back to Appalachia.
---
21. Max int + egg head only. No chem boosts
---
what‚Äôs your evidence that bethesda has taken the steps necessary to ensure this isn‚Äôt possible. you can‚Äôt even respawn if you die when an event ends - why would you think they have this under control
---
There were people who believed the inventory stealing exploit back when it WAS a hoax, and there were people who didn't believe it when it was real. There were people believing the opposite too. It doesn't mean anything
---
Ya, I rarely die anymore. Usually it's from fall damage trying to access peoples vendors.  Lol
---
I would love to see creatures hit harder rather than making them super bullet sponges.   The imposter fight is great for this reason!!
---
But there isn't any translation to being a ghoul that would negatively affect your ability to play 95% of the game.
---
Are those available as models? I don‚Äôt think they are.
---
Hell no. It only gives a 10% damage buff so it can't compete with junkies, bloodied, or quad.
---
May be a dumb question but did you try sorting out the list by ‚Äúvalue‚Äù? It will bring plans such as that one to the top of your list. May be hidden if you have a lot in the ‚Äúnotes‚Äù inventory
---
I find there‚Äôs a lot of lag on a private server, even when it‚Äôs only me, my stash box is full and my scrap box has over 5000 items in it (based on me seeing recently that I have over 3k cloth ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).
---
For those saying its impossible for something like this to happen, it can, while it might not come to a "permadeath" they can still use some sort of script to mess with your character, as player data is stores both on the client side and bethesda's side.
---
All they'd really have to do is have access to a cache file that loads up your character when you start up the game, if they can somehow make the server your on send you something they made with a script directly to your players cache file, it could cause data corruption, which bethesda would have to do a rollback for or a last save method of character from their end.
---
There was a similar thing that happened like this back on a game called Mabinogi, where hackers could "black robe" a character you owned by teleporting you into an item like a tent, when logging in after getting kicked from that hack the character was blacked out and couldnt be accessed until Nexon did a rollback.
---
Just throwing this out there because I don't like seeing this community lose stuff or progress they earn, its not fair at all on you guys, so i'm just writing this to let you know it is possible..
---
Ya that would be awsome
---
Oh haha. I opened the link.  I see now.. lucky.. I only noticed my machine get lock picked one time, and I had just emptied it. lol
---
Yup. New quests will only last a few minutes. We need a reason to keep grinding. Increase the item level cap, new legendaries/set items, and like you said, faction systems. 
---
And maybe a fix for trading item for item?!?  (Just got scammed for the first time, and i cant stop thinking about how petty that is. Lol.)
---
It‚Äôs faster to load than gta online.
---
I've been a bug/secret hunter since launch and followed a lot of the dataminers, yet never heard about the gilded .44 until yesterday. On the flip side, until yesterday, I haven't heard of the gilded minigun SINCE january. Something wacky is going on and I wish we had more info about it, but seeing how cool and rare these are, I can see why people would want to keep that to themselves
---
Ya, the legendary perk system should be a priority for Bethesda.  Kinda bummed the holiday event ends tomorrow, nothing new to grind for.
---
Same Base as me then.
---
I also have
---
* \+2 From Vaultsuit (Shielded)
---
* \+3 at Night
---
* \+2 Brain Fungus Soup
---
* \+5 IF I want to use Berry Mentat's (Not done that yet)
---
Hopefully in the future
---
No! It was all scrolling a bit excessively. Like practically I didn‚Äôt open enough gifts to receive that much stuff it was saying I received. After the plasma grenade plan wasn‚Äôt in notes all I thought to check was junk as I knew I had just emptied all of mine. When it was still scrolling in the left I checked and still had nothing in junk. I kind of stopped paying attention and assumed it was a glitch.  I suspect it was a glitch, I‚Äôve never been lucky in game before. That being said I swear I‚Äôve seen in craft menus it saying ‚Äòyou need the plans for this item‚Äô and saying you have missing perks. This is simply saying I don‚Äôt have the right perks. I‚Äôm just torn about getting those perks over others to be disappointed!
---
My two shot explosive Gatling gun still outclasses anything I‚Äôve found
---
This only happens to me when I use a combat shotgun.
---
Come back and tell us that (preferably in more comprehensible language) when it eventually happens lol

That's strange, for me the private servers are far more stable than public. I never lag in private unless the host is from like central EU (I'm in the US) then it's slightly laggy at times. But public servers are just a nightmare for me, couple weeks ago went to launch a nuke. I was solo and couldn't because the delay trying to interact with stuff was terrible. I don't know how much scrap I have though I'm sure it's a lot because I pick up everything üòÇ
---
as most other folks on here have said, yes the game can be done solo but it will get pricey with ammo, especially with the SBQ and imposter fights
---
i personally have done vast majority of main quest solo but have had help with little bits here and there and i do help other myself whenever i can.
---
No, explosive legacy weapons, handmade rifle, teslas
---
It's how they kept important NPCs alive in other Bethesda games of the same engine. It wouldn't be super surprising if they ported some version of that for use in 76. It hasn't been proven to work as far as I know but it's not a totally implausible off-the-wall idea.
---
Tyler County Fairgrounds is great for low lol scorch and tons of good stuff like food and drink. Caps and guns to scrap etc. One of ,y daily runs.
---
Usually a bobble or magazine as well
---
The only redeeming factors of PC rn are the perk loadout mod and being able to customize the .ini file
---
I should clarify, it‚Äôs only when doing stash things like putting stuff in a vending machine or taking items out of my stash. I do wish the stash limit was 1000 though, I‚Äôve got loads of meds and fusion/plasma cores that take up loads of space. I pick up everything too. In the EU.

I've seen people use the wind generator for a windmill. Looks pretty good. I saw a grain silo on one of the newer datamined threads too.

I want to believe you, but this is literally exactly what you said about the Inventory Steal hack and then the Christmas Massacre happened.

Haha, for sure better than disappearing into the void. I just assumed it auto learned from some type of bug. It hasn't happened with the other dense plans I've recieved though. Robot and metal plans have shown up in the normal fashion.

Congratulations, that's some of the weakest arguing I've seen on here. Are you playing logical fallacy bingo? You're well on your way to a full score card there. You won't see it, but you lost that argument almost immediately, well done. 
---
Props to Verdic for bothering with you as long as he did.
---
No not stupid at all! I‚Äôm blonde. These are all possibilities! I didn‚Äôt do a sort by value- I just sat there like a bone head and read through each one. I think I was fairly through but sorting by value is a solid idea- thanks!
---
Put all your notes in the stash box.
---
 And will you come back after the holidays and admit that you were wrong if nothing like this happens?
---
I just got put back on the same server right after I quit. I was quitting and restarting trying to see if a vendor's plan inventory changes (do they?) and happened to be put back on the server I'd just left. Mind you this was a clean quit and a very fast restart, not the usual client crash.
---
To another post; just because one client crashed doesn't mean the server crashed too. I suspect they just never got around to trying to reconnect you where you left out. Annoying too, I lost out on a hard-fought Poseidon Energy Plant reward thanks to this crappy design.
---
Build yourself something ridiculous in your camp, like a shrine to a teddy bear or write out some stupid dad joke on a wall. Something that breaks immersion enough to remind yourself that whatever you encounter is just pixels on a screen. Have a pet in your lap or nearby while you play, if you have one. 
---
Start with a handful of locations on the fringes of your comfort zone, familiarize yourself with them and farm them for loot and supplies until you‚Äôre ready to add a new spot or two to your rotation. Clancy Manor way up north was one of those ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù spots for me for a while, as well as the Aaronholt farm when I was a wide-eyed, ‚Äúwhat the fuck was that sound?!‚Äù noob. 
---
Get yourself a power armor chassis and start gathering pieces. Raider at first, then T-45 and so forth. There are  spawn points in the Forest area, and nothing makes you feel quite as invincible as a suit of armor. Bonus points if you use a battle cry when you engage an enemy.

Before you know it, you‚Äôll be 100+ and taking down scorchbeasts by yourself. üëç

Calm down. People who say "snowflakes" always seem like the spiderman meme pointing himself.

I asked this question a while ago and got attacked and called ‚Äústupid‚Äù
---
I haven't had that issue in my private server or if I have it's not been bad enough or slow enough for me to notice or care. I wish we could get another stash increase too,  I like collecting all the rare outfits, junk, ect and it just kills my poor 800 limit. Hell since the Christmas event I can't tell you how many legendaries I've sold in my vendor for 5c or to a general vendor, or just dropped cause I can't hold them all. They should of raised the daily limit on the legendary exchange during this event

The gold .44 was an atomic shop skin.. it‚Äôs not available anymore
---
Hahahahaha thank you. This is a subject that irritates me to no end and it‚Äôs usually the people like ‚ÄúOh I dOnT cOnDoNe In GaMe ThEft. ItS wRoNg.‚Äù
---
Ok...blue screen...brb üòî
---
I would be ok with just perks. I wonder if you will be able to put them on the favorites wheel.
---
It‚Äôs not a glitch. An enemy corpse is a container that generates items based on the loot table specific to that type of enemy. The loot tables are also instanced  and randomized between players, so if 24 players encounter one enemy, there is a potential for 24 different loot outcomes. Weapons aren‚Äôt guaranteed, just the same as drugs, ammos, etc. Many items, though, are extremely common to specific enemies, and the loot-rolls become relatively predictable.
---
Additionally, a 3-star legendary does not guarantee a 3-start drop; it only provides you the chance to receive up-to a 3-star item. Many people think it‚Äôs a bug when a drop doesn‚Äôt correspond to the creature‚Äôs legendary level, but I do not believe that to be true and I have yet to hear Bethesda say that it is so.
---
At least there‚Äôs Murmmurgh, she guarantee your drop-level and scrip is easy to come by.
---
I can just hear the lag about to begin as it attacks
---
Probably my most hated enemy in the game
---
Does the gold atomic shop skin say "gilded" when applied to the weapon? And the .44's with the gilded skin do not have the atomic shop tag on them.
---
Lol fair enough
---
Well my camp is glitched underground so I find it useful just to log when someone is griefing me or the base for no reason.
---
How do you build a basement?
---
Swapping between Rifleman &amp; Commando is a smart option for SBQ.
---
My main Sneak/Crit/VATS build uses a Furious +50% VATS crit handmade &amp; Zealots +50% VATS crit fixer at SBQ.
---
I agree üëçüèª
---
Bonus points if you can buy vouchers from the atomic shop.
---
This is literally, exactly what you said about how the Inventory Hack couldn't possibly be real, then it was.
---
It‚Äôs not even called gilded .44 whoever you‚Äôve been speaking too is lying to you.. it‚Äôs was available well over a year ago in the atomic shop now and is referred to as ‚Äúgold .44‚Äù nothing more.
---
Well the display stands from FO4 are already being used in the game as is so I have no idea why Bethesda is so reluctant on those given they're already in the game and probably still have their code to function attached to them even though atm nobody can use it at its current place
---
Happened to me once after idling for a while but when I rebooted, it was just fine.
---
If you're that desperate try using pharma farmer and keep rerolling medical coolers. You'll build up a stash in a few hours of play.
---
Except what he said is pretty much spot on. I've been reading up on the forums these hacks came from. Basically the steal all hack was done by flagging the player as a container, all they did was remove the "take all" function. They can still place items into others inventories. Which means that they still have the ability to modify the players tags to container. So them just modifying that a bit to change the player from "container" to "NPC" is absolutely trivial.
---
I don't know what that would do to a player though, but seeing how many people have ended up with corrupted characters just by looting while lagging, I could definitely see the character file getting corrupted, or even if not, what happens when an NPC gets killed? You can loot their inventory...
---
Either way it may be a permadeath hack or "steal all items v2.0"
---
Okay, thank you!
---
Then what is this?

I have tried a few times to build cliff houses but I always spawn at the bottom of the cliff.  What is the determination for where you spawn when going to your camp.  Beautiful place btw.

I have them. I accidentally removed them when I was trying to click on something else to use super duper. Didn't realize it was off.

Here‚Äôs a noob question, speaking of those camera mode pics. I‚Äôm on Xbox. Does the amount of saved pics affect the game‚Äôs performance? For example, all those camera mode daily challenges... should I be manually deleting those?
---
Thanks a bunch man!
---
This PSA made me sad, because it‚Äôs not very accurate. Maybe you could edit it with the corrections other commenters have made? Because it is a pretty good drink after all!
---
I thought I deleted this

Totally agree!!

Same here!  Lol
---
It‚Äôs gone now, but editing it would have been fine! Either way, cheers! I‚Äôll be having a Sweetwater‚Äôs Special Blend tonight!
---
Yes I‚Äôd like a bigger scrip allowance too, and more caps at a vendor. Trying to buy wrapping paper to get plans for icicles, I‚Äôve chewed through my caps.
---
That's not a website...
---
It's fo76map.com (No "s")
---
Information would‚Äôve been useless. +2 perception can be given by items that are way easier to make.

Right on, right on

Won‚Äôt be a need to, I‚Äôll be too busy killing players off lol
---
Those things are just evil...  I hate them so much.
---
Does anyone know where you get the cool door that's in the pictures for the mothman bundle, it's not part of the bundle.
---
It's a wood door with glass slats inserted top to bottom.
---
Thanks for the tips. I had someone ask me to power level them for caps. I have never been asked that question before and assumed that they were trying to rip me off. It's probably just my anxiety over losing stuff to a thief.
---
Even FO76 is a ghoul, somehow surviving the atomic disaster that was its launch!
---
I think you nailed it. ESO has done so many great things with their game that 76 could/should mirror. Choosing factions off the bat would bring new life to the game.
---
If you are married, hire an excellent divorce lawyer.

Rsn into hom and a pack of Super Mutants last night... firdt time seeing him out and about.  I ran from him to deal with Mutants and then found him again but during the fihht i aggro'd a bunch of gouhls and got myself dead.  Was a fun encounter though.
---
Lmao what I'm not married but I don't understand
---
you will
---
Rad rats for me, tanky little mothers
---
Hahaha do you mean I'll spend all my time playing the game and if I was to have a wife she'd want a divorce because of it?
---
There ya go

Turn on pacifist and stop taking workshops, they are PvP objectives.
---
Lmao I hope you're not speaking from experience
---
Super cool picture! Very noce dude
---
No for me it was half life
---
Since the event I actually found myself wanting to engage spawned scorched. Before that I found them to be a weak nuisance with little to nothing to offer. I'd never thought I'd be passing up Super Mutants for these guys. Hopefully they keep them legendary.
---
Wonderful lesson to teach your son! Steal from others it's fun. Does stealing anger other, yes? Who cares, or better yet it's fun to grief people. Downvoted, sorry not sorry.
---
I haven't tried it whith this game but I tried it with COD once a while ago and the playstation would connect to the PSN just fine but I couldn't game with it. Wouldn't connect in the game. I kept getting some sort of network error message.
---
If you daw the post yesterday guys, I posted a few more pictures to it. http://imgur.com/gallery/iFfRZaV   It's not the gold paint from the atomic shop, that looks different and is not tradeable. It looks like this is called The Garrahan paint, and is listed on wiki and non available paint job for the gun.
---
I don‚Äôt let it happen obviously. One day I went afk for 10 minutes came back and everything was destroyed.
---
My buddy does he has probs with cod and battlefield but he claims on 76 hes fine thats the most i could tell you tho mate
---
I use First every time I am on for scrap box, solo server to farm workshops, extra fast travel points when not doing workshops, and guaranteed fast item transfers between alts.
---
I still play on public Adventure mode a lot for player vendors, but swap back and forth quite regularly. To me, it is absolutely worth it.
---
Low levels, as in under 10 hanging around white spring offering to trade is always suspect.
---
Doing that with Lever actions now...
---
It never happened to me before a few weeks ago (Xbox) and yes I‚Äôve been playing since launch :)
---
No I wouldn‚Äôt
---
I see so many great ideas here and Bethesda's gonna skim over it and say... "mmm nah."
---
Are you on PC? If so they're saved in a folder on your computer. I've taken thousands of photos between 3 characters &amp; mine are all still in the folder. I've never tried to access them from in game though
---
I have for many months and the game runs fine for the most part. Trying to download updates and patches takes forever, I wouldn't recommend trying that. But for just playing it works fine.
---
Nah you did okay.
---
My assumption is that this person is a lower level and you a higher level? If this is the case they probably just wanted you to take them to higher level areas so they can tap an enemy once and you kill it so they can get the xp. Not sure if this is what they were referring to but I do this for new players ocassionally so I can drop them higher level gear.
---
Yeah some people really just have nothing else to do other than ruin others enjoyment I guess.
---
Those kings are no joke
---
I agree! Maybe we will with the dlc one can hope at least, those damn ice lights about drove me crazy trying to get üò°
---
If someone starts picking a lock I leave and such. My camp has only been destroyed when I‚Äôve gone away from the game for a couple minutes.
---
This is exact opposite of what I said about inventory exploit.
---
Hahaha. I'm really good at it üòÅ
---
I really hate that this is a problem.
---
We need item-for-item trading, instead of just item-for-caps trading. 
---
Our current system relies on trust, when it doesn‚Äôt have to.
---
That is what I used. Got it for 500 caps in a player  vendor.
---
Wait, what? That's such an awesome pic! Really nice man!
---
What effects are on each one?
---
It‚Äôs helped me üëçüèΩ I dropped all notes expect maps and I don‚Äôt keep plans that I already know/don‚Äôt sell after a few days, same with all the Holo tapes
---
I‚Äôve had to do it a few times. Load screens can take a little longer but the gameplay itself is fairly consistent with when I‚Äôm playing with a wired connection.
---
Bethesda in Wastelanders : Our research showed that players like lootboxes so now you can enjoy one for only 4.99

Perfect pic. üëå
---
We want more stable servers! Whatcha try'n ta do here?
---
Which one did you use ? :)
---
That's good to hear! I've dropped/stored all mine but unfortunately it's still pretty bad although slightly better possibly. I will have to clear out my chems next
---
Bloodied fire rate with vats cost less is what you need.
---
How much would that cost me on PC ?
---
Surely that will be their takeaway, but what this event really demonstrates is that a caps sink lottery is giving people a reason to exchange caps again instead of selling items for real money
---
I wouldn‚Äôt waste your time on a Bloodied Fixer. 1. They are damn near impossible to get 2. Anyone selling one will want everything you have including a kidney.  
---
The Radium rifle with faster fire rate is fun. The Handmade is the best all around rifle when you put powerful automatic on it.  Look for either of those with FFR or Faster reload.
---
Oh for sure I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not getting worse lol. I was just curious how far back the problem went because I thought I had seen it mentioned before. I‚Äôve only been playing since May.
---
Thank you ! :)
---
I don‚Äôt know what is I need to play the game again but my xbox live is fucked up
---
We can only dream.
---
A suppressor on the railway rifle would be quite funny as well
---
They both have normal fire rate. I don't make anything automatic, I have all my perks set up in the Rifleman build, so I set up all my guns with Hardened receivers and just pull the trigger really fast
---
A new version of the watago virus causing havoc with machines
---
haha yeah, but it would be 6ft long with a can at the tip :-)
---
You only really need 2 power armors... the excavator for mining ore and another on X01/T60 for everything else. Save the space in your stash for other things.
---
The ps4 magnum is on pc with a ps4 controller input, just like a ton of other rare stuff that isnt available on consoles. Unless it was just introduced in the latest patch unannounced. See my last comment on another post for more details. Big time weapon collector on xbox and I have had gilded miniguns since they first were found on scorched conquerers way back in the day.
---
Nawh it was the regular display case they give you but now lookin they might have patched it
---
I see. Explosive damage adds 20% more damage, if I remember correctly, and the Fixer does only slightly more damage than a Combat Rifle. The sneak bonus is nice, though.
---
Most people want Fixers because they can only drop from the Purveyor and are somewhat rare.
---
K thanks üëç
---
Except I'm on pc and not having those issues, I just play on my own server... I mean it costs less than the subscription to xbox live or psn. So really wouldn't say the console is "better" more of a "gilded cage" with no mods or ultrawide support.
---
Serums and ammo are the only other uses for the flux.
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt do it   And YouTube should ban him for showing that shit.
---
Those zones could instead fill a ,"Feral Meter"
---
Wouldn't true raider mode be not caring about the other person's attitude?
---
True. That's a really good summary üòä
---
The gifts alone granted me 17K caps today. I'm still wondering if I should use it to buy the trophies I want or buy the wrapping paper to craft over 20 large gifts üòä

The presents weren't what I liked, it was the amount of Legendarys I was able to obtain... Even is basically all of them were trash. It gave me a reason to go places and farm. I now have a full stash of items to sell on my vendors, as well as plenty to turn in for scrip. The boxes were just a little icing on the cake, but not the best thing about this, imo.
---
For end game, we need more reasons to explore what's already been seen... And this gave us that reason. When it ends, we are all back to farming Westek &amp; Whitesprings, along with some scorchbeast killing. Having legendaries pop up more often gives you a reason to go to more places, rather than just to the places we know have them.
---
Not really when you realize the steal inventory hack did basically the same thing, only instead changed the player flag to "container" and their "fix" was to remove the "take all" function from containers. 
---
The fact they can still place items into players inventories demonstrates that they still have the ability to modify the players flags to mark them as a container, they just can no longer pull items from them. So changing that hack to change the flag from 'container" to "npc" would be absolutely trivial.
---
Would it cause permadeath or loss of your entire character? That I don't know, maybe a corrupted character, or more likely it will end up being "steal hack v2.0" as when you kill an NPC you are allowed to loot their inventory.
---
You can just go on a new server too.
---
The difference between +3 stats and +15 is night and day man.  Stack that shit hard.

Once you get to level 49 you could also start using the [Portable Power](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portable_Power) perk, which reduces the weight of your PA. Then you can just lug it around with you. 
---
Consider looking for a set of level 50 T-51, which has better stats than the T-60, although you can‚Äôt use the sweet BoS paint schemes on anything but a T-60. See this [guide ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive_power_armor_and_mods_guide/) for super helpful, detailed info.
---
I love the Power Armor idea and didn‚Äôt think I would to be honest.  Thanks for the info.
---
I need to keep all the mid matched sets because I don‚Äôt have a set I can use and I‚Äôm accumulating the different leaves appropriate types.  I didn‚Äôt even know there were different types as I‚Äôm new to Fallout as a whole so I‚Äôm nerding out pretty hard on them at the moment.  
---
Of course I need to be able to build a power armor station at my camp soon.  I don‚Äôt know the plan for it yet.  Can anyone steer me in the direction of where to get the plans for it?
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info! I want an Instigating, +10 DWA, -25% Vats Fixer as my primary gun, that would be perfect for my sniper build. Extra sneak perks, double damage +10% on that first shot and -25% Vats for trash mobs so I don't have to switch guns. 
---
I was really excited to get this thing cuz everyone is all about them, but my combat rifle is just better and I can apply the super sweet jack o lantern paint to it, so I may just sell the fixer. Any idea what it might be worth? I sold a High Cap backpack plan for 10K and was certain I had ripped the buyer off, so clearly I have ***NO*** idea what stuff in this game is worth :D 
---
Fun Fact: I got the JE Combat Rifle AND the Fixer plan for one of the 5 badge backpack plans, so yea...I was clearly the one getting ripped off selling the 8 badge one for 10K! LOL
---
Re: electricity usage...it‚Äôs not an issue for most players once you learn the fusion power generator plan. Place one of those bad boys down and you can easily power your entire base. You basically set it and forget it.

As a high level player I also loved the event. It was fun again

Well yea, and I don't see why we can't have player made factions as an alternative to guilds.
---
Hence why I kill them?
---
I've been doing similar in a Mrs Claus outfit lol
---
There are various power armor mods (besides shocks and jet packs) that need flux.
---
Other uses include prime receiver mods for weapons (and their special ammo as noted earlier) and the  decontamination arch.
---
I think they are awesome, especially because I did something like that, but with concrete floors outside of the map.
---
lmao!
---
328 levels in and these things still drop me before I even know they're there. Endgame boss should be a giant flying mirelurk King and then we'd have ourselves a challenge.
---
Complete the Miner Miracle quest. You‚Äôll get the crafting station plan.
---
Best to get a set of Excavator first. Useable at 35. Added 100 carry. 
---
If your XB1 I  can craft u a  35 excavator extra durable etc  Triple Cray

 I am a PA lover too lol

What if he's right? Honestly wouldn't surprise me in the slightest at this stage
---
" I only go into raider mode if someone is being an assbag."     
---
That's not raider mode. That's self righteous vigilante mode.
---
I just paid a bit more for an explosive fixer, but your price seems fair for the one you sold. Honestly I probably overpaid, but hey, I don‚Äôt mind.
---
Hmmm. Not sure why I'm hoarding it then. The BoS understood sells, but requires so many materials that it doesn't seem worth it. And unless there's a huge influx of new players, serums seem like a bit of a waste as well. Been meaning to build a recon arch in a low level's camp for free so maybe I'll do that.
---
It's a neat build and I get the indestructible aspect but most of the ones I've been in they never use walls so you're looking into glitchy infinite graphical space and looks weird to me. 
---
That's just my opinion though. A lot of players like it hence why they build that way.
---
Awesome idea!
---
300 atoms next month.
---
This can be done with modding on pc version.
---
I think between 15-20 minutes. Grab an elastic band if that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre  going with this lol ;)
---
Actually I made a concrete bunker and glitched outside of the map inside my bunker that has a fusion generator and concrete floor with a wooden bottom story but I ran out of budget so I couldn‚Äôt build any more walls or floors I wanted to. Foundations take up a lot of space.
---
For King and Country - forget about the Mothman-Cult, we need a stronger one.
---
Meh. I like the raider theme and aesthetic and I'm nice and helpful to players I encounter in the game world. But if they are assholes right off the bat becuae i have "raider" in my name I play the part. 
---
Call it self righteous if you want. It's how I enjoy playing the game. Just because I like the raider theme doesn't meant I have to be a piece of shit to every player I encounter.
---
Yup that's what I'm gonna do lol. Thank you
---
Yeah I just use it now for Ultracite 50cal and 556 since that's what I use so I keep alot of violet in stock. Other than that it's pretty useless. I quit selling serums a long time ago so I really don't need any other flux. I do collect alot of inert flux for drinking purposes tho when I'm in the zones.
---
Well it's mine and I'm on ps4, so it is definitely on ps. That other post is me too if you mean the one about this one yesterday.
---
 https://imgur.com/4SdcCZg

Yeah. I wish foundations used less budget space too. But it's probably their way of preventing players making huge concrete castles lol.

There should be a timeout option.  If you reconnect to the Fallout servers within 120 or 180 seconds of being booted you get to be put back in the same server you were in.  I recommended this like 10 months ago when crashing was so common...
---
I've had several people ( 3 in the last 2 days sneak up one shot me but nver take the workshop. Those aren't raider role players they  are just a holes. A real raider realplayer would let be take the workshop build it up ( put down extractors, turrets ect.) Then actually take the workshop.
---
yet they will know exactly what you duped and i know what they can give to players who lost everything. a refund
---
You should check out the old days of diablo 2 closed b.net hacking back in .08 and .09 if you want to see crazy hacking. People were importing items that couldn't exist in game from open b.net. Public dupes happened every so often, aimbots, tppk hacks, maphacks, chicken hacks, etc.
---
If you think hacking is bad now you should have been around online gaming back in the late 90's early 2000's when online gaming started to just get big.
---
Nice thank you!

There is zero evidence to support this, at all.
---
Ya. I used to want to actually build a castle but I wouldn‚Äôt have had enough space anyway. I used to live in a cave blocked by foundations lol.

Yeah, inert flux is tasty. I like having a lot of it.

Factions with built in perks -

Ghoul: Complete Rad resistance both environmental, attack based and food/drink.
---
Raider: Bonus ballistics damage and chem bonuses
---
Mutant: huge strength bonus but intelligence maxed out at 5
---
Vault Dweller: Bonus intelligence and perception but highly susceptible to radiation and diseases
---
Survivor: Bonus endurance &amp; agility, minor radiation and disease resistance
---
Junkie's Fixers, even if the other two effects are not great (but that -25% VATS cost is pretty good) still seem to sell for quite a bit. Someone offered 40k 5.56 for one with Faster Speed While Aiming not too long ago, and other offers seem to be similar. You can always go to The-Sub-That-Must-Not-Be-Named and ask for a price check there.
---
8 days, 8 fucking days and I'm still getting replays about how hacking isnt new. No fucking shit, now go take down Bethesda brave warrior.
---
Man, this shit should just show up in the corner of the screen or something.   Who the hell thought it was a good idea to cover half the screen with this shit?
---
No, nor do I support using someones rape survival story in an attempt to support a bad argument about a video game.
---
Agreed. One or two are easy, but 15+ of them? It‚Äôs a pain in the ass.
---
Isnt 1st 100 a year 10 a month live costs 60 a year
---
Yeah, I think this is starting to show the average age of the playerbase if they think this hacking is bad. Diablo 2 hacking was INSANE prior to blizzard creating warden and rust storm, and those still didn't stop all the hacks or bots.
---
I remember running like 6 bots doing baal runs every time I wasn't actively playing the game just to get gear to trade on JSP for god roll pvp gear.
---
They need to make it more of a role play aspect like we all thought it'd be
---
Not even safe on a roof. They sonically whack you from afar.
---
Cool, thanks
---
A few things:
---
1. The only way to cause a character deletion is for a message from the server, which, unless these "hackers" somehow end up in control of Bethesda's servers is not possible.
---
2. In that forum, users outright said to disregard it as they intentionally lie to get react.
---
3. The guy who released source code for the last 2 "hacks" tried various methods (according to his post) and could not perma-corrupt any character.
---
I am saying you are being silly in your expectations and "calling it out" about this terrible game is a waste of time. May as well accuse Donald Trump of stealing office supplies. Videogames journalists should of been warning everyone flout 76 was an incomplete bug riddled pile of garbage at launch.
---
IKR? Just die you little b@st@rds!
---
Now you have "Xbox Dead"! ;)
---
Yep
---
There's all kinds of neat Left 4 Dead type stuff that could be done with that, like if your feral meter fills, you lose everything you've added to your inventory during that playtime and can only perform unarmed attacks, but you get a power boost, can summon hordes of ferals and get a huge amount of XP for killing another player, all of which become hostile if your feral meter has filled (except other feralized ghoul players).
---
Sounds like too much work for Bethesda, though, seems more like a community mod.
---
I sell the HC backpack plans for 15k caps if I can take that much. I prefer to trade the plans though as caps are just not my thing. I've got 22 badges now if you know anyone that is interested in a couple backpacks.
---
I was going by monthly costs. both are 10 bucks a month.
---
Why?  The fixer is a combat rifle with a sneak perk and faster movement speed while sneaking
---
&gt;Isn't that why there is a camp budget?
---
The camp budget is to reduce loading times, yes. But you don't have to download every texture when loading someones camp - those textures are already on your system, stored locally. The lag in loading CAMP's comes in one of two places:
---
1 - Lag from the server telling you want items are where in the camp.
---
2 - Lag caused by your system being slow to load all the assets.
---
Having pictures like OP suggests would mean that every time you enter a CAMP it would need to download the textures for all the pictures present in that CAMP (since you aren't going to have everyone's screenshots downloaded, obviously), which would likely further increase lag and in fact would increase both types of lag mentioned above.
---
I like events like this and meat week because I I get places I rarely go. Meat week is especially great because the server comes together. I squill a little when I get a plan I didn't know so this has been really fun.
---
For sure lol
---
good work. 
---
btw, shielded casual gives +3 INT, while shielded vault gives +2 INT.
---
Why would I want to take down bethesda when I like their games? You seem to have me confused with someone else. Maybe try to calm down internet warrior before jumping to conclusions.
---
I would love an addictol recipe as long as it was extremely addictive and caused withdrawl symptoms. Also make the Mr Pebbles ride addictive and cause withdrawl symptoms. Thanks.
---
Yours Sincerely,

A Junkie.
---
Or put items in your inventory that then permanently corrupt said character. You supposedly can be longer take things from players, but you can still place things in someone else's inventory, including objects that are never supposed to be in your inventory and can mess up the server side of things.
---
Omg you think you‚Äôre so SMART
---
I support this message...
---
Really?  A chance to double your money and get hundreds of pounds of junk (that would normally take hours to acquire), with the only risk being 50 caps (that you can replace with virtually no effort)?
---
If you say so. I‚Äôd run that event each time it showed up. That‚Äôs a huge potential return for such a minor investment.
---
Low risk/high reward. I‚Äôd be shocked if anyone intentionally passed that up.
---
Do it then post the destruction of the camp
---
Exactly. You can‚Äôt damage a player‚Äôs CAMP unless they‚Äôve been flagged for PvP against you somehow.
---
Ok throwaway. I'll try to calm down and not reply to 8 day old posts about hacking. Why are you even on this 8 day old thread? You that deep into posts where you just happen to find and 8 day old thread and happen to single out my 8 day old reply. Sure mr throwaway have a nice day.
---
Cuz I took a big break at the beginning of the year, and missed the introduction of this weapon. Came back in september, and everyone and their momma wanted some manner of legendary fixer, so I kind of assumed they were some kind of all powerful golden gun or something. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious
---
The fixer has preexisting stat modifiers on top of legendary effects.
---
If u have the tank killer card a bloodied Ffrate tommy gun with a quick drum can be good
---
As far as I know, I think its Bos heavy combat armor
---
Of course there would have to be a $20 Deathclaw option
---
I have enjoyed this event because I have actually seen wanted players running around the map again.
---
I actually have had two people steal my gifts from my Santa Tron, only to meet a fiery death.
---
You're a degenerate sicko...............I like that
---
Because it is still the top 5 posts for this sub in the last month. I also didn't single out your reply, if you look I've replied to about 4 different people in this very thread less than 10 minutes ago.
---
Keep making random assumptions to fit your narrative though. LMFAO
---
Did they take the junk you dropped and then leave?  That‚Äôs possibly all they were after. 
---
Smash &amp; grab. Why stick around after that‚Äôs completed?
---
Oh man.  I agree.  Turrets are useless.  I waste so much junk to keep them up and running and they barely do anything.
---
I haven't really dabbled with Tommy guns, are they any good ?
---
Go to you-know-where. You'll have a buyer lined up in minutes. I got 2 serum recipes for a 5 badge plan the other day, and that's roughly 30,000 caps worth of stuff. Sell your high cap plans for much, much more bud, the grind for those badges is apparently worth so much more than it should be
---
&gt; hehe think you missed the bit where he said dps per shot
---
hehe - I think you missed the fact that there is *no such thing* as "DPS per shot".  I saw it.  I chose to ignore it as a misstatement.  Damage per Second refers to the amount of damage every second regardless of how many shots fired.  A single shot' s damage is the damage per round.  They are two very different things.  
---
Unless your intent is to one shot something then only DPS is a reliable indicator of how much damage you can actually put out.
---
People end up in factions in the previous Fallout games anyway. It only makes sense you begin in one. Not every player character has to be a vault dweller. New Vegas did perfectly fine having you play as a mailman.
---
I enjoyed collecting the mounts. I‚Äôm happy with my armor set and weapons. My day to day is collecting junk to bulk and sell or make ammo. But I enjoyed collecting, even buying and selling the mounted head plans. 
---
But damn I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to be throwing away a TON of the common ones.
---
Yeah, those mirelurk kings are motherfuckers. The legendary ones are the worst enemies in 76. üëç
---
Tried that, no one ever responds to the price check posts. I do have one up asking for offers, but nothing yet. For now it will live in my collection of Junkie's gear, which has \*twitch\* grown rather large. I'm \*twitches\* proud of it
---
I'm calling you mr throwaway because that's your name. Do you not know what you named your reddit account? Also I've been gaming on pc for a long ass time and yes hacking isnt new but it is really bad right now and almost every game is suffering from it.
---
Highest DR outside Metal is Polymer Scout at 86. Heavy Bos is 81
---
Wait... how do you turn off the PA hud view? That's why I hate PA
---
I remember this cave. I was a low level and was running around in circles trying to kill that level 50 King. Finally did, and I felt so dang accomplished. Went a little further seeping looking for whatever I was sent there for and came up on a second level 50 king. Was just like holy.f. Put on a stealth boy and snuck past it.
---
Sounds like the PC guys can't get a break. I'll say one thing though. We shouldn't give this guy and his team the credit of being hackers. They are essentially modders. They are using known modding methods for the creation engine. 
---
Calling them hackers is giving them a title greater than they deserve.
---
^^^this here
---
No he was not, he was banned for using a glitch that he never submitted. Please do your research before just blindly repeating lies.
---
I'll have to look into this. I didn't even know it exists. Thank you

---
Can you not benefit from both Broiled Brain and Brain Fungus soup?
---
Herd Mentality is broken, really broken.
---
Has been for a long time, and they havent fixed this yet. 
---
For some reason, when you are ungrouped, the Herd Mentality effect does not show up in your status menus.   This has the unfortunate effect of making it impossible to get rid of if you are solo.
---
The only way to get rid of it is to use a radaway, or decon arch when you are in a group with someone.  The mutation has to be visible in your menus to get rid of it. 
---
It took me like a month to figure this out the first time around.
---
i got one of them as well 2* b ffr handmade.
---
conpared to bloodied 2* vats33 mg50 its just a sad weapon, i really dont get all the hype around it :)
---
No hacking isn't bad right now, hacking was bad back during the dial up days when online gaming was brand new. The fact you don't realize the sheer amount of hacks for games like EQ, ultima, d2, classic wow, etc. shows you don't realize how bad hacking was back in the early 2000's.

Dupers literally became millionaires thanks to selling their duped items on diablo 2:  https://www.dirt.com/moguls/tech/kraken-ceo-jesse-powell-spends-11-5-million-cash-on-a-mandeville-canyon-architectural-1202976319/
---
Melee is great but take your time, there will be better armour and weapons after level 50.  then you can also relocate perk points in case you want to change your built.  I started with a rifle built now I am the wicked guy with a bone hammer (no pun intended) charging into fissure sites to melee everything that‚Äôs crawling - and it feels great.
---
Look it up on YouTube. There are a couple god vids that show places he has a chance to spawn. It's not guaranteed he will always spawn in those locations though.
---
I usually just spam crouch to get someone‚Äôs attention and if they‚Äôre not getting the gist then I just message them, like last night I dropped all the known plans I had in front of a level 14 player at his base, had to message him to let him know the bag was for him.
---
Duping isnt hacking and I'm done with your stupid bullshit. See you mr throwaway.
---
You dont find grahm, grahm finds you.
---
I never even thought of doing that üòÖ
---
Bloody brilliant. The plans should show a picture of what they create, insane that they don't.
---
Thanks OP :)
---
Raiders can have different motivations, codes, etcetera. 
---
Some raiders in the lore are slavers. Others would cut down a slaver because that represents the exact opposite of non-authoritative freedom. 
---
Some eat children. Others wouldn‚Äôt kill a child and leave them at least one parent alive to care for them. 
---
Some are bloodthirsty murderers. Others are extortionists that realize a dead person can‚Äôt generate resources for the Raider to take. 
---
There is no ‚Äòone way‚Äô a Raider must exist. All that‚Äôs required is that they refuse to follow the predesignated rules of civilization.
---
They finally got a rewards system correct.
---
In my opinion they've been trying to straddle the fence between an MMO-lite and a looter shooter since launch.  
---
But the loot pool has been so ridiculously big and drop rates so low that killing lots of stuff never really generated the shower of rewards you would expect from a true loot oriented game.  Or more simply, the rewards system has been borked since launch.
---
This event really gave people a reason to go around and kill lots of stuff and be rewarded appropriately for the time and gave them a reason to keep logging in and playing.
---
I don't think any of those are worth 2k caps.
---
Duping isn't hacking? So then I guess all the dupes in this game were a okay? ROFL
---
It was absolutely possible to one shot them bare handed. The real issue were their numbers and hitting them in the first place.
---
I haven‚Äôt dropped a nuke on this character but I helped dropped a few when I played on ps4, on ps4 my character was like level 80 something when I stopped playing on that console, right now my current character is level 50 something, I want to get my level up and work on my heavy gunner build a bit before doing more quests.
---
I thought as much. I‚Äôm usually near a body of water anyways with my CAMPs (just in case I need a ton of Dirty/Boiled Water), so I could have been wrong. 
---
Thanks for the confirmation!
---
Sadly if this does become a reality, Bethesda still won't act on it until players have suffered.. you'd think by now they'd at least check and go over flaws or potential exploit points within their game to try and find how hackers are managing to get this crap into their games..  
---
For an AAA company, Bethesda sure has gone down hill fast.
---
The full trick is to deploy a PA frame, place the pieces on it, then just let it auto-return to your inventory, then transfer it to your stash.
---
I say auto-return as I'm not certain you can collect a frame back if it has over levelled pieces on it.
---
Yeah, Bethesda fixes the problems these guys cause faster than their own bugs so I don't think they're v good
---
I loved it and put many hours into it. I have about 450 hours in so far and this was a nice change. Hopefully we can get more like this.
---
Not really. They just carry it all with them all the time. What a pain in the ass sorting through all those items in all those menus
---
Honest hackers would at least inform Bethesda about the exploits to get some bug bounty but tbh I don‚Äôt even know if such a program exists for fallout. If Bethesda doesn‚Äôt fix it after a reasonable amount of time, fair enough to go crazy and hack the shit out of this game.
---
Heavy Metal with Polished mods.

---
IIRC, you gotta do at least 1000 damage to get loot
---
This should answer your question.

---
Yeah np on XB1, had to do it when I lost my internet, didn't even really notice too much lag .. didn't use much data for me, maybe 20-50MB per session, wasn't terrible
---
I typically forgo my build for this fight and pump out some .50 cal ammo real quick then just roll with my Prime Explosive 50 cal machine gun.  There's no way in hell I'm gonna to burn through all my ammo for that fight.
---
Wow, my character at the time was hovering around level 50 with a full suit of excavator and an exterminators Gatling plasma, I didn‚Äôt go down once. Low key proud of myself as well for not dying at all.
---
And she‚Äôs 22k something, I think.
---
I recall it was 1500 damage?
---
There's no one way, sure. But the way is 100% not helping everyone you see, besides people who are playing a raider pillage character and killing them. That's not a raider in any sense of the word. Raiders raid. They don't help everyone and strike down criminals. That's a place officer wearing a raiders outfit.....
---
Since you asked for pure physical resistance, Heavy Polished Metal.
---
Holy crap, I didn‚Äôt even know stats could go that high! Thanks for the info üëç
---
Unfortunately, these 2 consumables do not stack. Brain Fungus Soup is more convenient of the 2, so it's a nice backup to have if the Scorchbedbeasts aren't dropping brains.
---
He‚Äôs in Boston for Bruins games now and then.
---
PC? if you are online atm I will pass you one if you want.
---
Oh ok, thx
---
My thoughts exactly.  Why bother with content that actually involves coding when you can sell a new power armor color for $18?
---
I am 99% sure you have to know plan before it will show up in crafting menu. Once you learn a plan it then shows up in crafting menu- along with whatever materials and perks you need to craft said item. An easy way to double check - if you have an alternate load them up and see what is under the alternate toons crafting menu, as plans are character specific not account specific.
---
Kind of similar to why I help out the younger new players, I‚Äôm a mom and it kind of just is in me to help out the kids.
---
Yeah. Bethesda can fix it faster than this modder makes these things. He admits it's been a WIPmeaning it takes him a while to figure out how to get them to function. IF it gets released I bet it's patched within 24 hours.  Hopefully they take this stuff seriously and already have a game plan to attack it before it goes live.
---
I've seen camp-wide power radiators proposed. Doesn't seem like too bad an idea.
---
I personally like the wiring though. Quite enjoy electronics of all variety out of game so it's a nice little spill over for me. A well done conduit system looks nice (albeit a bit heavy on budget iirc).
---
Camp owner claims to have set up in the forest, no nuke zone of course. Not saying he is dumb, just evilüëç

I'm a courier for the trade subreddit I use. If anyone needs a middleman on PS4 they can hit me up. You can look through my post history for successful courier jobs if you need

---
Really? I'm I also mistaken in that Mutant Hound and Glowing meat stack? (2x+10% Dam)
---
Last I checked all Food Buffs stacked.  Chems don't.
---
this. searching is tedious and usually not successful. then when you wont expect it you hear his voice. looking for certain plans? also ps4
---
Have you ever seen one in real life? Absolutely creepy little shits.
---
It's annoying. I kind of like the new bun but that beehive is good for exactly two looks only: Marge Simpson or Elvira.
---
This answers my question, thank you.
---
32k (Something just over)
---
300DR along  with 70% Damage Reduction, I understand.
---
I read a post yesterday that it was staged. Someone said he knows that kid and he was given back all the stuff that was taken plus others donated stuff to him.
---
Impossible i do 600 headshots on her and i can waste 30 mags in one fight
---
I hope this is so, I‚Äôd still like to make sure the kid hasn‚Äôt given up. His reaction was really tough to hear
---
When do these challenges end?
---
Raisin's got it right.   In fact, sometimes you can see the loot change if you get to a corpse immediately after it dies.  This is not a glitch, and it's not exclusive to Scorched.  It happens to all enemies you kill.
---
Yes, glowing meat steak and mutant hound chops stack. 
---
As of today (I just tested,) broiled scorchbeast brains and brain fungus soups do not stack.
---
May we meet in Sovngarde brother
---
I disagree. 
---
You could easily consider Negan from TWD to be a Raider. He does ‚Äòhelp‚Äô (almost) everyone he sees, but he enforces his own rules upon them, and makes a bloody example out of a random person in each new group. To make sure everyone knows who is in charge. 
---
And he does enact justice against those that violate his rules.
---
He takes what he wants from the settlements. Gives them ‚Äòprotection‚Äô in return. He has no qualms about using violence, even brutality, to accomplish his goals.  
---
But that doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt actually want to help people or isn‚Äôt going to punish criminals. His methods and definitions may be bizarre, but that‚Äôs also a mark of a Raider. 
---
They choose their own rules, regardless of what society or civilization thinks is better. And they‚Äôll use whatever methods they want to accomplish their goals. 
---
That‚Äôs all it really means to be a ‚ÄòRaider‚Äô. You don‚Äôt follow anyone‚Äôs rules but your own.
---
From what I read the kid was in on it.
---
Really? Why not?
---
Thanks for the update. I sure hope so. Do you have a link to that? Not trying to gatekeep you or something, just curious
---
Its very good actualy
---
It should do the same as your combat rifle.
---
The AMA dataminers have confirmed this multiple times.
---
Strange, honestly. It must have been a new item stealth patched in. How long ago did the person get it? Was it before last patch?
---
Cool.
---
This is the last day for the easy week of vault 94. I'll probably be on around 4:30 p.m. my time. That's pretty late your time (2:30 a.m.), but if you're willing to jump on then, I'll take you through.
---
Nah, that wasn't me. I'm really enjoying the camaraderie in this game though. I've only come across maybe 5 griefers since I started playing a month ago. One group got one over on me and i gotta admit it was pretty clever. Trapped me in a room with one guy blocking the door from outside and my only way to get out was to fight back and get killed by the high level guy.
---
Yeah I'll look for it. I didn't favorite it so I don't remember what the exact title was of the post.
---
Those are weapons I bet almost anyone would turn in for 40 scrip. One only bolsters your damage 30% to supermutants. Youte better off with anti armor, furious, junkies, or bloodied as they raise your damage more than 30% to everything. Not just super mutants. The 2nd raises your damage against other players. 100% useless as there's a 110 damage cap against other players. Something you'll do the same damage with an axe you craft on your own. The 3rd one lowered damage bybone target for 3 seconds. If you're not sneaking you'll be shot plenty of times before you hit your enemy, and then they'll be dead within a couple swings, rendering suppressors useless on melee.
---
Inb4 they make it a Fallout 1st option.
---
they dont want to be cork and leather, 
---
they want to be bombs.
---
Lmao for real, I got the new bun as soon as I saw it, looks cute. They need to add more because I would totally buy. They need a better ponytail. The young at heart one is too like pulled back but somehow loose looking at the same time.
---
aw you made a new friend and got a really kick ass picture
---
I'd pay to have a Behemoth that wears a pink frock and rides a tiny little pushbike everywhere.
---
Well that's what it was then. But the idea that at level 115 I can get one shoted is demoralizing at the least. The  did get much for their efforts  maybe some wood.
---
It isn't so much a character delete more of a loophole in the fix for the steal item hack.
---
They aren't hacking the server, they are just telling the server that the other player isn't a player but an NPC. Just like the steal hack told the server the player was a container. 
---
So because the steal inventory hack did basically the same thing, only instead changed the player flag to "container" and their "fix" was to remove the "take all" function from containers.
---
Not all do, stingwing filet (+2 str) will not stack with death claw  +2 str variant, tested and confirmed that last night.
---
Have you ever [looked at one up close?](https://imgur.com/a/DtKn0zd) The hairs really make it for me.
---
Thanks, I'll edit the list accordingly. I thought the 10mm smg wasn't considered a rifle.
---
If you are on Ps4, I'll gladly put an auto receiver on that railway.
---
I have a ghoul's slayer fixer that I love. I can regularly make VAT's shots with &lt;50% chance with it. I can even make &lt;20% shots often enough it's worth trying.
---
Its like this. It was a random drop not an event. Events like Faschnat, Meat cook, and Mischeif night had problems.
---
Faschnat problem was other players dropping Nukes on the area so high level players can only do it. (I have first hand experance with this as a lvl 20 going into a blast zone)
---
Meat Week problem was no matter how you completed it, (if it was,able to be completed) never dropped any rare loot 
---
Mischeif Night the problem with it was too much going on at WS and created server instability. Constant crashes, deaths, and failures.
---
But the holiday event utilized locations and was implemented in a way where if didnt matter if youre lvl 1 or lvl 500 you can get a loot drop from the special enemies. Im gonna miss the holiday event but I hope Bethesda does somthing like this,again.
---
And just because no one mentioned it yet, leather is the highest energy resist. I use a combination of raider and leather to get both damage and energy resist over 250.
---
Missing the Gauss rifle
---
Yeah with ffr and silencer,large quick drum plus mods for recoil they can be killer the only issue is there isn't as many mods as others for armor piercing so u have run 2* at least in the tank killer perc I'm a balanced rifle shooter part auto and part semi and it works good for me it would be great for yu if you go all commando with silencer if I were yu I would go double with handmade for distance and tommy for up close
---
Where did you read that it was staged? the guys behind the scamming sure made it seem real in their "we're not to blame" post

---
You have no idea how grateful I am you posted this!
---
yeah it uses commando (shhh but in NW it also takes advantage of gun runner like it's a pistol)
---
Or better yet when you die inside a blast zone from another players nuke the game should give you an option to become a ghoul.
---
PC sadly but thank you !
---
I left out semi autos, including the bolt pipe, bolt revolver hunting rifle, and bow. Mainly just looking for commando rifles. Thanks though
---
From what I understand, the numbers aren't entirely accurate.  Especially when it involves stealth.
---
What Bloodied weapon thats a automatic gun is best for project paradise boss that isn‚Äôt a Explosive laser . On my other account i use a Explosive gatling plasma it works well but i know it‚Äôs because they haven‚Äôt fixed explosive lasers so I don‚Äôt know what they expect me to use when it‚Äôs just me at event .
---
TIL, where would say it fits? Better than a 45 sub?
---
I believe, if all rifles are in standard form, the 10mm SMG has the highest DPS for a rifle due to automatic barrel as standard.
---
Unless there were pre-arranged rules of engagement, then so long as you don‚Äôt use glitches or bugs to win, it‚Äôs fair.
---
Lets just say As much junk I have in my scrapbox I cant even fathom going back to non subscriber.

a good one is a bloodied 50 15

I'm looking for the post now. I know I read it yesterday. Someone created similar post trying to track him down so they could give him stuff and someone replied saying they had that black cat kid on their friends list and he was in on it and he got his stuff back after they quit recording the video. 
---
I'm not saying it's true I'm just stating that I read that on here somewhere.
---
Do what you need to do.
---
What are you looking for? I‚Äôve found him several times the past few days but never see anything exciting in his inventory.
---
Been seeing him quite a bit around Charleston station
---
First off, what you wrote is at best a simile, not a metaphor, and secondly, even if it were a metaphor it'd be a poorly executed one.
---
That's the Cancer Meta dude.. i hate them... only Tesla Tesla Tesla... i have full Heavy Leather Sentinel Assassins Set with 750 Energy resist (solo) but Teslas are still aids.. 
---
I have use the last 6 months a J FFR and a JE LMG but now i use a Tesla too... 
---
You're on PS4?
---
If you‚Äôre trash then yes. It‚Äôs the cheapest thing you could do
---
I would use a .50 cal, lmg or minigun with bloodied, Furious, AA or even executioner‚Äôs as the primary and for the secondary I‚Äôd look for explosive, ffr or 10% damage while aiming. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can give you one of my spares.
---
Turrets are broken
---
Hang on I'll log in and check the numbers for a better guess
---
I'd go with "probably" because furious re-sets every time you reload to base damage as well.
---
Mods are ok to include
---
Thanks, I appreciate it, but you don't have to
---
dont take our 2 hour XP bonus, PLEASE!!!
---
Not directly help, but if you‚Äôve got Butcher‚Äôs Bounty, it‚Äôll help getting the meat and will even work on a SB corpse you didn‚Äôt kill.
---
If they are using it why not
---
Nice thanks, I‚Äôll try to perk that out soon
---
Ugh I hate those things...ended up going back to 4, putting godmode on and going to town on a bunch of them in revenge. Very cathartic.
---
In which case the Handmade has the highest when fitted with full mods.
---
Well that was an oddly specific example
---
I didnt get the game until private servers released - but its not because I dont wanna deal with the wanted players / thefts - its because I dont wanna deal with the crybabies that, for some reason, think the world of fallout should be nice and helpful. 
---
Keep truckin man. Fck people who try to tell you how to play your game.
---
Nah on xbox had to pick one up just to counter it
---
A member of my discord got 45k I believe. He just kept raising the bar.
---
They should drop better loot, I actually avoid them unless theyre in a nuke zone (they tend to drop hirad fluids) because it's a waste of ammunition and time.
---
I mean, 1000 atoms from the shop would be probavly what it would cost, get all excited, go to place a second one and it's the smoke machines all over again :/ build limit: 1/1 :(
---
Ive been trying not to do it but man some people and those explosive laser rfiles
---
And then a guy covers his wall in pictures of his dick because he datamines the files to input and wants to be edgy?
---
For god sakes man! [Adult] children play this game! The humanity...
---
hahhaha we get down vote for telling the true.
---
They‚Äôre carnivorous and eat other bugs, so I can‚Äôt hate them too much.
---
"Renting a private server", I believe the proper spelling is "running around in a sloppy seconds server from yesterday"
---
Lol you‚Äôre not kidding. I started off pricing my commons mounts at 150, then 99, now down to 20. I‚Äôve sold a few at 20 caps...a few.

Ark did it with no issue. Could take a photo in game and then put it in a frame and anyone could see it
---
Also useful if you‚Äôre farming tick blood for stimpacks.
---
Thank you!
---
This. someone turned me on to this when I was having trouble also. got the meat I needed off 3 beasts.
---
meh
---
I guess you did not pay attention to the story
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
&gt; I don't do the PVP thing, and I teach my kids not to as well. We play it as a PVE game, and we're happy with that.
---
Your personal preference isn't everyone's reality. The game allows PVP. The game allows stealing. Stop calling people out for playing the game the way it was intended. 
---
If you are unable to teach your children how to distingush reality from a game, well - I wish them luck. I grew up playing DOOM and GTA. Yet, somehow, I have made it through life without running from room to room with a pump action shotgun blasting folks, nor do I carjack people at random while walking down the street. 
---
Its a game, man. Play the game.
---
It's Todd Howard
---
This is pretty much my build when double xp events come around, I can usually pull about 90-100 levels over the span of the event (this last one I went from 551 to 641) a lot of people like to claim high levels are xp exploiters but they don't know about intelligence and unyielding xp gain, and don't understand that some people have a passion for leveling as something to do end game wise. Grats on the 1000+ man.
---
I like back on the beat.  Its a nice steady pace when I want to relax and still do an event.

Correct, it has to auto-return, as you cannot collect it with higher level parts attached.
---
I've tried this on Xbox and the controller still disconnects after a while even if being charged, really annoying.
---
Yeah this is the post I saw. Thanks mate!
---
She scales, when i go solo i kill her in one clip with my b25 handmade. When i played meathook build i actualy oneshotted her with sneak power attack
---
Yeah ai have that guy on my friendslist, he used to be quite annoying since he's always trying to pvp with anyone but i hooked him up with a executioners explosive tesla rifle the other day, if anyone wants to contribute they can leave there username and I can add them
---
Another user found it for me. It's here in the reply chain.
---
It has armor piercing rreceiver i think
---
Add me I‚Äôm the same ign as here
---
They need to remove all floating models or give us an option to toggle that shit off.  No more spinning floating models in inventory. Game would run smoother when inventory scrolling! Probably less blue screens when looting out in the wild too.
---
Somewhere between 327 to 655 damage. To be safe, 1,000 has never failed me.
---
Damn that‚Äôs a bummer. It works like a charm on PlayStation.
---
Also if you go bloodied sneak commando you go vats. I think railway is bugged it doesnt get accuracy from conc. fire perk. Only if its explosive IRC.
---
My buddy has my fixer and I sold my good combat rifle, but from what I can tell, it's probably this: 
---
Tesla, Fixer, Handmade, 10mm SMG, Combat, Assault, Plasma
---
\*please don't downvote me to oblivion if wrong lol
---
All you need is good armor and cola nut. Pop a couple quantums when necessary and they won‚Äôt be able to kill you
---
When I used a railway rifle before as a rifleman it always had 50% and never changed so yeah bugged :(
---
Yup, that's what i did the last time, made a very fat, scarred and naked lady, only think she has got is a board and a pipe pistol.
---
Players run of scared when they see here, lol
---
Thanks, I forgot about the tesla.
---
Beth have said at least 3 times that they're working on it (ask Google - I dont have links to hand). No idea why it should take so long
---
Wow, is plasma really that bad?
---
It usally works yeah iy just time consuming finding quatums these days
---
I thought the crying sounded fake and the kid was in on it, but then, crying isn't really something that sounds universally the same. So not sure now. 
---
But yea... wouldn't be remotely surprised if it was an act for clicks. If not I hope the kid gets straightened out.
---
Be warned, there is a limit to the number of things you can name, so plan ahead. I believe its 50 items, so if you have dreams of naming all the pieces of all 6 of your various armor sets, all your weapons, power armor frames and backpacks, like I did, you are out of luck
---
Heavy BoS is the best well rounded armor, it‚Äôs not the highest DR or ER compared to some others though
---
The best thing I learned is go slow. Don‚Äôt follow that quest till you have fully explored the forest and gained a few levels. Enjoy yourself and the quests there.
---
Is this game worth $20? I pre ordered it on Xbox back in the day but played it maybe 4-5 hours before education got in the way. Now I don't have an Xbox set up anymore but I just built a PC recently so if I get any spare time to play I just play on that. I've read a lot of negative things about how this game has come along (or hasn't). $20 isn't a lot to lose but at the same time $20 is $20, you know.
---
Yikes! Thanks for the info.
---
All of my bad ass new holiday creature mounts really feel the pain of this post...
---
I was going to say just that. Custom sprays have been a thing for 20 years. I think with new high-speed internet everyone could handle it, and if your internet is that poor maybe stick to solitaire.
---
She doesn't.  This has been demonstrated time and again.
---
Except it's probably unlocked because some asshole already picked it and they haven't been back to lock it again.
---
Pick up a .45 SMG and put a Scorched Killer's Receiver on it. It's rate of fire will jump through the roof, and when the SBQ lands you can run up and unload a magazine or two to pass the threshold for loot
---
Yeah it does but I'm skeptical on the piercing amount it gives yu
---
Oh but the acid it worth it
---
I use a - myself, but yes, it's great to have everything sort itself to the top of the list with default menu sorting. So much easier to find stuff, especially armor, because of all the outfits I keep in my stash
---
That last bit's my point. Telling someone to go away doesn't do him any good, clearly he's the type who WANTS input. And, bluntly, this is a wikipedia game, there's information you need to do a lot of things that flat out isn't addressed inside the game itself. 
---
Also these days, if you play on PC without checking reddit frequently for news of the latest hacks you're nuts.
---
So is the idea that now that we've experienced one awful and surprising hack, we should just expect/accept every awful and surprising hack? Why stop at permanently losing a character, why not speculate about the chance of permanently losing an account, or some hacker overloading our system so our actual PCs explode? 
---
I wouldn't be surprised by many things at this point, because yes stealing items from inventory is probably unparalleled in online hacking, but expecting or believing the worst is not going to make your day any better, nor is it likely to give you insight into what's actually going on.
---
She does not scale
---
"Toddngarde"
---
Sneak everywhere. It‚Äôs ok to run from a fight. Claim workshops for xp and stimpaks are usually awarded. If you‚Äôre on a public server, don‚Äôt worry about defending them unless you‚Äôre confident you won‚Äôt be pvp‚Äôd.
---
Where is this?
---
Put armor in chassis and let go to inventory by itself since u wont be able to get in.  Them put in stash.
---
Rads are like vodka.  Just enough and you get kinda tingly. 
---
Too much and it burns. It burns.
---
Wrong. None of the food that gives XP bonuses stack. I've tried.
---
Some people love it, think the game is very playable as is, and are happy that the developer makes updates regularly. Some like it a lot but get angry at the developer for some of the less than stellar decisions. A LOT of people piss and moan about a game that they don't even play.  I'm more in the first camp than the second.  It's the last group that causes all of the angst for new players.
---
In the mountains just above big bend tunnel east I believe there's one, just below Relay Tower EL-B1-02. Used to have my camp there, nice lake, only occasional enemy spawns. Most regular was Flatwoods Monster, lol.
---
Oh shit, my bad, I didn't count ballistic and energy damage together. It should be right in front of combat rifle. Oops. I'll edit my post
---
What weapon are you wanting to use? Do you have power armor? What platform, if you're on Xbox I can set you up with a decent lever action, shotgun or pistol.
---
My main is a rifleman, I don't run bloodied or junkie build and can still one shot most things.
---
Also if you stash your scrap at every opportunity dieing just means free full health.
---
I loathe these bastards.
---
Mmmmm.... I smell your jealousy and it makes my over-priced armor feel all warm and snugly... üòâ
---
Is it not all zeros anymore?
---
They both should do fine I would think, pop into your power armor with stabilized equipped and you should be able to hold your own no problem.
---
How are you scorched spawns there? I know that there are quite a few around. Don't they destroy your camp?
---
You damn kids will die for your selfies
---
Speedy receiver does tons of wonders.
---
Reevers still freak me out after 3.
---
Whats heavier? 1lbs of feathers for 1 cap, or 1000lbs of feathers for 1000 caps.
---
It is bugged, has been for a bit.  
---
I gave up on this one, and looked into others instead
---
I play on PS4 - I appreciate the sentiment though!
---
I just got a level 45 lever action but I can't use it quite yet. I don't have great power armor rn - I have the materials to get the excavator armor but I read somewhere on reddit that you should wait until level 45 at least to get the max version. I find myself using a combination of rifles and melee weapons, the occasional sniper. Are there any perks that are good for damage for rifles in particular? 
---
Haha also yeah the only way I got through the blackwater mine dungeon was to die multiple times and just throw tons of ammo into the incoming mole miners. Was super satisfying to finally make it to the end - the health refill upon each death was wicked useful (though a drain on my ammo).
---
I contacted Bethesda and they want pictures of what I'm talking about and their website won't let me upload pictures.
---
A wall of text.. you‚Äôre a hero. Congrats!  You never forget the first launch.
---
It's not really stealing, when you leave the santatron unlocked.
---
bloody ffr vats cost rare? looking to trade mine for a junkies swing speed str bat or sledge hammer or super sledge
---
And store your junk when you claim the workshop. Then you only lose caps if the workshop is taken. They caps are usually pretty low.
---
Stealth melee? For whatever reason I never think to go that route since I‚Äôm always running at enemies.
---
I'll have to try this, too... Also need to make sure I don't keep picking up duplicates of notes/holotapes... And yeah, my aid is pretty cluttered.... Might have to go on a low level drop run to offload some stimpaks and such...
---
If you have an active vending machine that is selling stuff then your camp can't be damaged... Or just build using foundations like I (and many others) have
---
I thought Project Beanstalk was in the main game?
---
Congrats! Now launch one and fast travel to the spot and let it hit you in the face. THAT‚ÄôS the end game. üòÇ
---
I find it easier if you equip a Vampire Gatling Gun that recovers your health after each successful hit on the creature. That way you're not fumbling around for a stimpak.
---
I love that cave. Just run all the way through it, and aggro all of the mirelurk kings. They‚Äôll follow you and fight the wendigo, and when you have to fight they‚Äôll be super low health
---
You would best be served buying bulk steel and gunpowder to make your own 5mm. You can use perks to drastically increase the amount you make. Other ammo types I'd buy, not 5mm though.
---
Mirror ball plans
---
F
---
i just want bethesda to try to make another fallout game that won't kill it
---
They would never add more free atoms.
---
Stash your junk, turn up to One Violent Night and Uranium fever, punch everything in the face and wait for other players to make the kills. It does not matter how many times you die, you just need to tag to get the XP.
---
I also wouldn't say no to the dense leather chest plans
---
Sold one for $13k last night. I know the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù thing to do would be wait after the event but I put high prices on all the event plans for the hell of it and if people want to bite early, so be it. Also sold a few Santa Crash and Icicle lights for $5k before.
---
If it‚Äôs unlocked it‚Äôs free for the taking. If it‚Äôs locked I may also pick the lock, worth the 10 cap bounty. If it‚Äôs in a room but you put a window maybe I‚Äôll try a few times to use power armor to access said room. Basically if it ain‚Äôt behind 4 solid walls and a roof your basically handing them out.
---
Take your time.
---
At L36, you are not quite ready to go some of the places where roses quest(s) take you..
---
You feel overpowered for the forest, and underpowered for most everywhere else.
---
Have you started the excavator quest (miner miracles)?
---
Or the mysteries questline? (Hint: do the objectives, but do not return until after L50, as the reward is much better then)
---
Joined the brotherhood of steel?  completed firebreathers?
---
The healing factor mutation may help your stimpack consumption, in that as soon as combat ends/threat eliminated, ou health will boost to 100 (less radiation)
---
Same lol.
---
Yeah, this has been broken since the start of the game. You have to just get incredibly lucky for it to actually check off, but most of the time it doesn't. Sorry, bro.
---
Drives me crazy that all this is happening and Bethesda doesn't even seem to...care...like at all..
---
Yes i do that but I‚Äôm unsure it‚Äôs because i need more damage this is what i run for project paradise on my heavy gun build but also my nuclear winter character took 4 off strength and changed it to give other specials 9[heavy gun build ](https://imgur.com/a/vvaffkY)
---
There's one right across from Slocum's Joe down the road from Overseer's.
---
I get excited because I finally have someone to PvP with. Otherwise I hop servers and move on with my life.
---
Yes but it looks really dumb poking out of the top of the case like a giant metal dildo.
---
Bethesda, please. Bethesda. I need this. Look at me. Look at me.
---
1000x yes. They are the worst for melee. I feel like even deathclaws don't stagget that much.
---
It's kind of hard to respond to an exploit that hasn't happened yet. Unfortunately they need to see how it's done before they can fix it. Just like the bomb squad can't defuse a bomb until they actually see it. You can't stop a terrorist attack if you don't know when and where it's happening, all you can do is try and minimize the casualties when it does happen.
---
I made a vendor/mule for public servers. I transfer some good stuff to sell, as well as the gifts to open. I‚Äôve got quite a bit of caps now on this level 4 character. I buy stuff from others with him and then transfer that loot back to the main.
---
You can craft the excavator armor for higher levels later on. Go ahead and make it now.
---
...Are you on PC?
---
Turrets are currently too busy targeting each other as well as the Santatron. üôÑ
---
This worked for me. And completely stopped my turret from shooting at my Santatron while ghouls wrecked my walls. Yes turret as in singular. Might even nix that one.
---
Melee weapons are already OPaf right now against Scorched. I love my melee weapons, but they do not need another buff.
---
well done sir o7
---
Nothing wrong with waiting on the excavator if you really think it's going to end up as your main power armor. By the time you hit that level, almost every armor available to you is going to have nearly double the Dr or Er...or both.  As far as the armor stats go, the excavator is lacking.  What it is good for though is the utility of mining and carry weight.  Might be worth it to craft the highest level you can now so you have the protection, then upgrade it down the road. Takes more materials but you may not care by then if you start using better armor as the excavator will just sit in your stash unless you are going out mining.  I kept a level 25 suit until around level 140.  The only reason I upgraded it was because I was sitting on a surplus of materials.  Some people use it as their main armor though because of the carry weight.  Comes down to personal preference.
---
You can upgrade the order of mysteries weapons at a workbench when you get to the appropriate levels.
---
Healing factor is great if you‚Äôre doing long range. Otherwise I‚Äôd hold off till you can get class freak to offset the negative effects.
---
Mutations serums can be found most commonly in other players vendors. When on the map they show up under misc. but at the vendor they‚Äôre under aid.
---
No please. Gawd I hate those things. I fast travel back out of camps that use that blaring siren. We should be able to shoot those.
---
Yeah it gave me a reason to hang out at fissure sites.
---
It's made me so paranoid. I've gotten to where I think I am hearing it but I'm not. Anything that jingles and I get whiplash.
---
My mole miner‚Äôs gauntlet with 40% faster swing speed and 40% more power attack damage already one shots all scorched and can kill a level 80 scorchbeast in 10 or less hits so....üòÖ
---
You know what, though? I wasn't talking about actual response to the sack of shit doing the damage. I understand that you can't fix a problem when you don't know what it is. 
---
I'm talking about the radio fucking silence from the company over this entire situation.
---
Definitely take the first of each rifleman perks in perception, that alone will raise your damage 30%.
---
I‚Äôve done it too but unlimited data. Not too sure I‚Äôd try it on a limited plan
---
I am, but I finally found someone selling them. I'm back to being a happy mutant.
---
I stopped taking more the 2 since first month because server would crash.
---
I also notice with powerful automatic recievers the assault rifle edges out the pipe rifle
---
If seeing the, ‚Äúserver not responding, controls temporarily disabled‚Äù notification followed by a log out and back to the log in page, it means the whole server is wiped. That server you and everyone else was on, no longer exists as you knew it. In other words, you can‚Äôt go back, it‚Äôs just not there. If blue screened, you can easily get back to where you were IF on a team.
---
I just watch the video today and I was thinking about him....I feel bad for tha't kid....
---
I want help him too. Im level 70 but i can donate some stuff
---
Ahhh. I‚Äôll have to start snatching those up.
---
They stagger on head shots.
---
...wait. What?
---
Because grinding EXP was an issue with the first 2 broken builds I made. I literally leeched SBQ fights  to lvl 85'ish on my Commando. Plus I would need to move 15 points from Perception to Strength. And get all the perks. it seemed like just leveling to 50 would be an easier route.
---
And it gave me a chance to ease my way into the new build. Especially since I never really used PA on any other character. 
---
I'm glad I did. I learned a lot my second time thru and did things I missed on my first time around.
---
Hah! Yes, exactly. So far, I've been afraid to trust anyone to do that... I'll keep working on finding a partner!
---
Valid criticism does not equal ‚Äúhaters‚Äù
---
&gt;PD: Hope someone track down that scammer bastard irl.
---
Imagine thinking that someone should get hurt IRL over a video game.
---
Brain Bombs, baby! +3 INT for 90 Mins.
---
They just wanna pvp and are probably bored of NW and there's no survival servers right now. You should just leave the world and switch to a new one instead of wasting your time.
---
Inherent "bug" that they never fixed from fallout 4.
---
If you're planning on being on a server for a long time, head over to point pleasant and count the hovering verta-bots. If there's more than one or two, find a new server...they end up over there as time progresses. More than a dozen? Server probably won't be up that much longer.
---
Yeah that can't happen anymore. No one can damage you or your camp unless you have returned fire. Slap damage and the ability to destroy camps while outside of pvp was patched out when they released the vendors for camps.
---
I think you could be right. In all honesty though, if Wastelanders is as big as they say it‚Äôs going to be I would be okay with that.
---
If you check out #10 in the Community Guidelines you'll see a link to [Bethesda Plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz) topics. A quick check shows that your idea has been brought up many times.
---
Both the explosive effect and the Fixer should add 20% damage compared to a non-legendary combat rifle at the same level. But the explosive damage can be increased with perks, which would make damage number shown for the explosive combat rifle higher than that of the non-explosive Fixer.
---
Not 1v1. It seems cheap to me. Once they start ganging up, use teslas and stealthboys,
---
I felt bad one time when I didn't pvp someone who came and took my ammo factory. They killed me and I just came back and sat in my chair I had built and they messaged me like "pvp plz" and I just wasn't in the mood cause there were 3 of them and 1 of me. So they just left the server. Got to keep my ammo factory.
---
Just you or me, nothing personal.
---
Had an issue like this where a nuclear ode peice kept cropping up on my screen every minute as it kept duplicating itself!
---
Yeah, hopefully melee sees a nerf in wastelanders, after all they did mention a rebalance of alot of stuff
---
For example, a legendary gunsmith who could tune up your weapon condition better than you could on your own (&gt;200%) for caps could be a nice cap sink.  I could also get behind an increase the level of the weapon for a combination of caps, scrip and a voucher you get for completing a certain event.  Lock in the vouchers non-tradeable and once a day like raids.
---
Or the glowing skeleton mask.
---
That's the only reason I like 1st.
---
&gt; We're talking about social behaviors in social environments.
---
No, you are talking about virtual assets being stolen - using mechanics present inside the game and intended as a legitimate gameplay tactic. Also - specifically:
---
&gt;I don't do the PVP thing, and I teach my kids not to as well. We play it as a PVE game, and we're happy with that.
---
What? Its a PVP game. Just because someone has decided the PVP aspect isnt for them, its all the sudden looked upon as antisocial (jesus, bordering on sociopathic from what some of you folks reeeeee about)? So I am, in fact, arguing the right point. Deciding not to PVP in an online game that is designed for PVP doesn't make you a good person - and stealing items or shooting at other players doesn't make you a bad one. 
---
If you have trouble separating real world behavior from virtual world actions, you need help and should see a professional.
---
Yeah. I don't know if legendary versions of non-light armor even *exist*.
---
Added!
---
\*Complains about limited time event rewards.\*
---
\*Looks over and sees that every single MMO game mostly have seasonal events with limited time rewards.\*
---
Yup, nothing wrong here at all with this post.
---
So a few things that are worth noting.   
---
Contrary to what some folks say, Int DOES affect experience gain. About to take down a larger enemy? Consider popping a mentat.  Unyielding armor also helps with this, as does a mutation and various other aid items.   
---
As for consumables...I'm fairly sure at this point you can get chemist, ammosmith, and at least the first rank of super duper.    
---
Diluted stim packs are your friends. Chemist means every stimpack becomes 4x diluted stimpacks. Same for radaway and rad-x. Ammo smith ups  your ammo production, and super duper has a chance of doubling your output when crafting (almost) anything. Armor, weapons, ammo, chems? Always run super duper, you never know.   
---
Another thing...elsewhere you mention hanging onto a level 45 lever action. Unless that's a GOOD legendary, don't bother. Never hang onto gear unless it's within a couple levels of where you are, unless it's a decent legendary item. Base level items are all craftable, and the blueprints are obtainable from various vendors.
---
When you see that they have spotted you - you know you're in trouble.
---
With my build i use a rifle and the cripple perk, i can make a yao gai limp and kite it. Mire lurks, hit hard, often and have a ton of hit points.
---
Well other than  boosting your special stat by one I guess it doesn't do anything else?
---
People arguing for harassing people online need help and should see a professional. We can stop the conversation here.
---
...so. Uh. This one?
---
Yeah? And have all anyone see is my many pictures of the mire, ash heap, savage divide, etc from me Reaping atoms?
---
 My Primed Zealots 50 Cal takes 10-15 seconds to take a SB down, but I can one punch a Legendary with my Bloodied Unarmed. It has gotten to the point that I dont use my melee, just so I can have fun when hunting. It doesnt need anymore damage buffs.
---
I've been really lucky with disconnects since launch and even less since one of the patches.
---
I think it‚Äôs supposed to but it doesn‚Äôt add the health end normally does:/
---
'Cyber terrorism' isn't actually a thing. I know it sounds 'cool' and all.. makes nerds feel tough &amp; less pathetic or whatever.. buuuut real terrorism has been around far longer than the internet. You can't just add 'scary' words to things and pretend it's legitimate.
---
Here, let's do this.. I'm going to go grill me a steak. While I'm away, I want you to hurt me with the imaginary realm you're living in.
---
When I come back, I'll be completely unharmed and you'll still be an idiot.
---
Ready?
---
Set..
---
GO!
---
If you put - it put it at the top \_ puts it at the bottom.
---
Is 2k caps worth it for a level 35 bloodied 1* handmade? I've just found one. I'm on PC btw
---
I dont think it ever will. Tbh, I see them upping it as crazy stupid as it sounds....
---
Personally I‚Äôm waiting till wastelanders bc the Game is a little dead right now and there‚Äôs not much new content short of the scorched event that ends tomorrow
---
Thiw was the lowest effort event ever. Since you guys like this game, 2hoch is the epitome of low/no effort, no wonder you love this event. Bet you found Project Clean Up Appalachia amazing as well.
---
So boomer any chance yu were one of the hackers.......
---
I‚Äôm not talking about anyone in specific. 
---
I‚Äôm talking about what the requirements are to ‚Äòbe a Raider‚Äô. 
---
Which boils down to ‚ÄòF-ck your rules. I make my own.‚Äô
---
I will have to do this just to attain 62 intelligence. Maintaining is another story. Thank you and added.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Hard hitting and edgy.  8/10
---
It actually is a thing... hence why the term exists. I wouldn‚Äôt consider this cyber terrorism, but cyber terrorism does indeed exist.
---
True that, I want it bc it will give me stuff to do on the private world
---
Can‚Äôt wait for more melee buffs complain all you want but we still have to get up close and personal to do anything.
---
That depends entirely on what you define as harassment. 
---
Stealing items from someone's camp isn't harassment. Following that same person around day after day in a targeted effort to piss them off - is. 
---
Shooting at someone you randomly happen across isn't harassment. Following them around day after day in a targeted attempt to piss them off - is. 
---
However - if you think they deserve any consequences outside of the game world - then YOU are the one who needs help.

damn pesky rads do a real number on the hairline, lol
---
me and a friend walked into the whitesprings golf resort just as a nuke zone was disappearing and i swear we got surrounded by like 20 bloated glowing ones, eesh, good thing we had marsupial cause that roof was a life saver
---
The post warning people of the impeding attack coming tomorrow was taken down so hopefully it doesn't happen. It probably will happen though just like last time people tried to warn the community and they got shut down only to find out the hard way that it was true when they lost all their stuff. Nice to see some people still playing it smart after last time the warnings got deleted only for them to look like morons after it was proven true.
---
Datamined. So more than a rumor, but not officially confirmed?
---
Id buy 1 month if youre curious. I did, and loaded my scrap box up and didnt renew it the next month. When I get low on mats and need more, Ill buy another.
---
Not exactly.  Last room has some dead crickets and SB u can loot.
---
I agree
---
Myself I would like to see it raised if not eliminated.
---
Seems to me it would be easier on the servers to remove the items from the game (scripting the gear) than tracking all the gear in a players inventory, especially after the holiday event.
---
Personally I would like to grind it as much as I desire.  I don't think that would imbalance the game, maybe make things a touch more expensive to solve that.
---
Use a death tambo, it jingles similarly when you swing. **paranoia intensifies**
---
&gt;Why are you comparing 76 to Eve?
---
Because you said:
---
&gt;If he is a trash with others on videogames, he is probably a trash irl.
---
You didnt say "fallout", you said "videogames". You generalized, so I decided that was an appropriate comparison. 
---
&gt;Whether that's stealing from other players in a game or threatening others through a forum or uploading revenge porn, or even something as simple as being a big douchebag, you deserve consequences.
---
Dude, stealing from others in game is fine - as long as its done using in-game mechanics and without hacking or using exploits. 
---
Threats are bad - and should be treated seriously. People making out-of-game threats should be reported to law enforcement. 
---
Revenge porn? What? Wow that escalated quickly. Pretty sure this is illegal. 
---
Being a douche? Tough shit. There isn't anything you can do about it outside of the game. If you think there is, see the above reference about reporting to law enforcement. Good luck defending assaulting someone on "they stole my video game items". 
---
&gt;Genuinely making other people's lives harder in a place where that is not appropriate is the important part of the context, not whether it happens face to face.
---
Says you, and how you like to play. I prefer fallout to be the wasteland. I like encountering and dealing with thieves, raiders, etc. They give a game content. And as long as its done using in-game mechanics, designed by the programmers to provide that type of gameplay - there isnt anything wrong with it. You accept this when you click "play". 
---
To be clear - I'm not devaluing how you like to play a game. That part of course is up to you. The problem is when people decide their way is right - and others are morally wrong for, again, playing a game according to its design.
---
Yeh I want the atoms but the main thing is the server. Thanks mate!
---
I was just thinking about this yesterday. I have mixed feelings. Without the limit I feel like I would get in an endless grind of searching for legendaries and scripping and not playing the actual game. From that angle, I think it should stay. 
---
On the other hand it‚Äôs pretty arbitrary.
---
Oh ok. Thanks!
---
I have just discovered how rare this plan is today, so I will be on the lookout for sure.
---
If you open gifts on a super low level character, it will give the most rare items almost immediately
---
Noice!, I personally created a full tank class with melee weapons that is really good for me.
---
I support the idea of punishing the hackers, but I think you're exaggerating the current importance of their impact. Hacking affects a very small percentage of players on any given day and most of their damage was done to Nuclear Winter, which is a decaying mode at this point.
---
Most people playing this game are completely affected by hacks. That may change, and Bethesda needs to get on security, but I have no idea why you would let them affect your perception of Wastelanders, of all things.
---
do you even hear yourself? you hack and exploit and cheat and then say I am on a sinking ship with people trying to rescue me. you aren‚Äôt trying to rescue anyone. you are just bitter and full of resentment. the mental gymnastics you did to try and paint yourself as the good guy are laughable.
---
That was a PC only issue and that has nothing to do with the Holiday event or events in general.
---
Yep but you have to but another month of fallout 1st to get it
---
Thanks :)
---
Make that a background it's so cool
---
That would take forever, I agree with what you did.
---
I get that but like all "MMO" I should be able to sit down and grind for the day if that is what I want to do. Sometimes I'm in a grindy mood other times I'm in a social mood sometimes they overlap. Not to mention limited inventories and I hate seeing legendaries being left behind or sold to robots.
---
Over 10 million times the payerbase!
---
Is that a mirelurk king?
---
"Dude, stealing from others in game is fine - as long as its done using in-game mechanics and without hacking or using exploits."
---
That's super obvious, man. I was clearly talking about online actions that are not appropriate in context-- I even directly stated that. xD
---
Also, I'm not the other dude you were replying to earlier. So a lot of what you wrote is irrelevant in relation to the specifics of what I wrote. I don't support hunting people down and beating them up over an in-game thing, but I also think you were being flippant in your response and generally acting like it's OK to be a shitlord online. Hard disagree.
---
With Pharma, I‚Äôm overloaded with Stimpaks, Radaways, and chems.
---
Your not losing it. Unfortunately this quest doesn't checkpoint, so if you log out or leave the quest requires you to start from the beginning.
---
However you dont have to. You can simply go direct to the glass cavern and go through it to do the quest. The important part is right at the end and investigating this is what counts. I missed the final signal beacon you are meant to listen to on my run, but it didnt matter.
---
Well done!
---
Nothing really new - the Christmas scorched event is just ending and from here we're waiting for Wastelanders to come out.
---
I hope! I've been collecting tons of Police and Firefighter outfits. Love to display them at my Responders camp. Would definitely add a upgrade to camps
---
Thanks so much. I‚Äôm in the glass cavern now :)
---
I think it is just bugged. ‚ÄúWaves‚Äù of enemies often don‚Äôt spawn correctly across different events/quests.
---
I have the same issue sometimes with AWOL Armaments. Instead of getting proper waves I will get one gutsy spawning at a time.
---
Same sort of thing happens in Line in the Sand, Irrational Fear, and the firebreather quest in the main story.
---
There is a item editor that even lets you add gilded miniguns with legendary effects, use Google .. it still works üëåüèª oh and also a new dupe method if that is your thing
---
&gt; the amount of Legendarys I was able to obtain... Even if basically all of them were trash. 
---
 I got like 200 legendaries (100 with main, 100 with low level characters) and no one of them was usable for end-game. And I didn't care! It was fun... and scrip is food for the Purveyor, so more fun comming!
---
I think I see what the problem is here.
---
You're on Facebook instead of Twitter. *nods sagely*
---
Yeeaaaah...girls who use the girl thing to get stuff are guys most of the time. Just sayin'.
---
Man I saw a free roaming scorchbeast north of the vault yesterday and it wasn't the one from the airport so I was like what the hell??
---
What I would pay for:
---
Garden plots that snap together.
---
Ignorance is everywhere. You cant force people to think. Ignore them and know you are better.
---
There's nothing to be afraid of but Yao Guais. But in all seriousness if you're on Xbox and need some help around I'd be happy to help. I miss having this kind of in game fear tho sometimes- I had it when I first started playing 76 - I wasn't afraid of anything and then I met my first Wendigo. I've never run so fast in my in game life lol.  I remember when I played Fallout 3 - being in the tunnels. Feral ghouls have always scared me, they just run at you and scream that horrible scream. I would get so immersed one time my sister talked to me and scared the daylights out of me because i was so focused I didn't notice her.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Guys do it to other guys, just so you know. Constantly informing each other how this trade isn't worth this much blah blah blah. So if it helps any, it's not just you.
---
I'm absolutely loving mine. I don't struggle to kill anything. And I dont worry about being killed either. I use a .50 Cal (Two shot, something, something) for shredding mobs and taking down Legendary bosses quickly. And I have A Vampires(something, firing speed) Gatling Gun I use for slower dps and healing. 
---
Both guns work wonderfully for me.
---
Last night I came across a Sheepsquatch fighting  with a 2 star Lvl 80 SB. So I jumped in and tagged them both, and didn't realized the Hermit crab behind me that brought his SB friend along too. I literally stood there tanking all 4 of them while pumping lead into each one until they were all dead. 
---
It was a very satisfying battle. And I'm very happy with how this build turned out!
---
I‚Äôd say wastelenders comes out but it ends up being really mediocre and the game will still be a mess. 
---
I feel like with NPCs there is a lot more potential to do a Bethesda and introduce more bugs and controversy to the game.
---
I‚Äôll still hop on for wastelanders though I stopped playing the game, don‚Äôt expect much unless the game
---
is completely revamped
---
I hate those people, my best friend can't use voice because every other guy that hears her talk wants to date her... Like seriously, people like this are probably the same people who microwave Cheerios to feel the warmth that they lacked as a child.
---
I'd like to use caps to increase my chances of getting the legendary weapon I want from the purveyor. I've spent well over 20k scrip and still haven't gotten any weapons I want.
---
IDK about raising it, but Really wish that script item value would be in such amounts that one could hand in X 3\*, or Y 2\* or Z 1\* legendary to get the full amount with no leftover.
---
Or at very least, let us hand in a crummy 1\* armor to get the last 1 or 2 each day. (A popup telling you that vender only has so much left and the remainder will be lost would be fine)
---
I‚Äôm still creating my build because I don‚Äôt have all the cards yet but even now if I fight an enemy with high armor or a scorchbeast it takes a long time for me to die so I chip away at their health with a hammer.
---
The Kings at the caverns were worse. there were 3 right at the beginning. I died ten times at level 100 and I haven't been back since. I don't know what's down there, but it ain't worth it. 
---
Kings and Colonel gutsies are truly the worst. I can survive a couple hits from the king, but gutsy takes me out in one shot.
---
Yeah, but nobody tells them to stop using their dicks for attention and friends.
---
1000 scrips per day I‚Äôd be happy
---
Nothing except the constant fear mongering on this sub. But go ahead and spread more bullshit.
---
Other people can hear your footsteps, regardless of view.
---
A lot of people don't realize this, but turning the cmfootstep volume down in the audio settings, *only silences yours*, makes it easier to hear people sneaking around you.
---
PC only I have heard
---
Now I think of it, the original idea was pictures from in-game adventures; so if it's limited to pics taken with a Pro-Snap maybe it won't be a problem?
---
Please stop this nonsense.
---
I also want a vampirism weapon, but sounds like your having fun and your pretty powerful now. üëç
---
Yes, there have been tons of rumors about this. 
---
Play at your own risk, hackers are trying to bring down Bethesda because they did not make  a perfect fallout game.  
---
Fortunately for the console crowd, we dont have to worry about this.
---
95% of Census Violence is standing listening to robot dialogue or waiting for enemies. It is incredibly boring.
---
I absolutely HATE that event but it has some rare reward drops so I‚Äôll do it once in a while.
---
From what I‚Äôve heard, 76 trading on facebook is dodgy anyway  r  / m √§   r K √™ t 7 6 is where it‚Äôs at
---
I‚Äôm in there as well, haven‚Äôt much luck in there either. Probably cause I‚Äôm asking for too much lol
---
No, I‚Äôm on Xbox üòö
---
You're purposefully spreading this BS, and the moderators need to start taking permanent action against this.
---
Inventory wiping is patched, private server entering in not confirmed and perma death does have screenshot evidence coming from a hacker on Discord. I would say stay away from the game on New Years and the day after; see what happens on Reddit from people who want to risk everything like last time. You are much better safe than sorry; I'm glad I listened to post warning on the coming hack last time and not people claiming it was fear mongering.
---
Crafted gifts give a 10-fold higher chance of giving rare wall-mounted plans than looted gifts.
---
What a dumpster person
---
Can confirm, played EverQuest.
---
Congratulations! I took my first solid shit in three days.
---
Wish you the best of luck, friendly PC wastelanders. Hope you all stay safe from these forsaken hackers.
---
All this from an unconfirmed youtube comment...
---
I did exactly the same thing in the same location.  When we got hit by that PA dismantling debacle a while back,  though, I just scrapped all but one set of PA and haven't looked back.
---
I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard rumors‚Äù, not ‚ÄúYeah this is totally true everybody run and hide.‚Äù I‚Äôm asking for a reason, chill out.
---
Sounds like a Fallout Y2K üòÇüòÇ
---
Pffft easy.buy the cryolator plan from the vendor in whitesprings.craft it.easily kills them and others.
---
I‚Äôm not spreading anything? I‚Äôm asking if there‚Äôs truth to it.
---
Some guys are just a holes I've played with girls online and never felt any obligation to treat them any different than anyone. ( Anatomy doesn't matter in the gamer world it's what you can do with your thumbs lol) and for the person that there friend can't use chat tell them that me SALTYSWYNE and my friends are willing to play and chat without trying to get in there pants or disrespect them in any way. We bs laugh and have fun together every night for hours at a time.
---
Was just wondering. Don‚Äôt wanna lose my stuff.
---
I know how it feels to hit a brick wall haha, I been trying to source some specific raider and metal armour for a while but it‚Äôs a nightmare, ngl it was easier to find my scout set.
---
What‚Äôs your platform? I got a tse laser I‚Äôm looking to trade if that‚Äôs along the lines of what you‚Äôre looking for.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I've done a ton of business on Facebook, way more than reddit. I had no issues.
---
I‚Äôm just trying to find out if I should be worried or not.
---
Xbox
---
The fixer has more base damage than a combat rifle.  But explosive, especially if you have demolitions perk, will offset that and more.  
---
You want to compare either non explosive to non explosive or vice versa to see the difference.  
---
The fixer has the highest base damage of any rifle that can be modified to automatic for use with commando perks.  This is the reason why this weapon is so coveted.
---
Add me my GT is BlaccAuraXO
---
Sounds like an incel. Can‚Äôt stand those dildos. I never got how gamers and some nerds in general became so toxic.
---
Max the Fireproof perk card and they won't be so dangerous.
---
Will try on gay guys brb
---
Cook them and then sell them fool. üëΩ
---
good luck to ya man, been barking up this tree many times myself, even pointed out how its one of the top mods for FO4, nothins changed in 10months since i started :(
---
Oh my. The white knight brigade is going to love you. You're practically waving their battle flag. 
---
üò±
---
Just how far do you think you have to go?
---
I am on Xbox
---
Mole rats are straight up annoying.
---
Do it themselves? HA HA HA HA HA oh my.
---
Add me, my GT is BlaccAuraXO
---
Don't defend them, just retake them, that way little chance of PVP since you do it at your liesure, and you still get XP and loot. Help defend OTHER players workshops. Just need to tag one beast then hide if you are getting chewed up.
---
Yep Mirelurk Kings, two of em I believe. I know this dreaded area too!

Virtual pat on the back from Todd but only after yu buy 100,000 atoms

They said using a second account.
---
And WoW. Don‚Äôt trust the night elves in Goldshire.
---
I'm sorry about that. All I can say is as a dude that plays games I want everyone of every gender and race (or whatever else I'm forgetting) that enjoys it to play games. I would love to have a girlfriend that games.
---
When I've used a female avatr I've had dudes be oddly nice to me in other games; in 76 it doesn't seem to matter.
---
I never used it so all I‚Äôve heard is he say/she say so I may be wrong, out of interest does FB have any sort of karma system?
---
Speaking of Fallout 1st. How do they expect to entice Customers who‚Äôs bought one month and didn‚Äôt renew back? It seems like it‚Äôs not being updated with exclusive stuff at all. Pretty random and bad for a subscription service.
---
Two more vaults where mentioned before that will be raids. 
---
There is Vault 63, 96 and then there is 94 is live.
---
Same here, shot in the dark but if you got either a JFFR or JE handmade I‚Äôd be down to do a 1:1
---
I‚Äôm rarely on twitter, kind of only on there to be a fan girl for The Weeknd üòÖ
---
Dont call us out. I'm not acting like that.
---
&gt; Also, I'm not the other dude you were replying to earlier. So a lot of what you wrote is irrelevant in relation to the specifics of what I wrote.
---
Lmfao - dude my bad. I got my reply mixed up. I apologize.
---
railway has vastly more damage per shot than pretty much everything on this list.  It's only held back by it's small magazine but this is the exact same limitation of the tesla that you have ranked #1.    
---
I'd have to test but if you are only looking at commando weapons I'm pretty sure railway will be the #1 option or at worst #2.    
---
automatic pipe rifle will have the lowest paper damage of the guns you mention.  no way tommygun and railway are below it.  The only way to make a pipe of any kind provide strong damage is to double dip rifle and pistol perks which gimps hte rest of your build but can help pipes achieve high end damage.  
---
All that said just looking at raw damage is a very limited and honestly bad way to look at it.  There's a lot more factors.  recoil, range, ammo weight (in the case of railway this is severe), magazine size, available mods, ease of obtaining mods, and other factors go into how effective a given gun can be in actual use.  
---
there's a reason why fixers and handmades are so desirable.  They are not the highest pure paper damage weapons but pull ahead due to other aspects and overall usability.
---
No, but a public "we're aware of the current situation and are doing our best to address it" would be, I don't know, sane? 
---
"We're aware of this upcoming exploit, and are looking into it, stay offline"
---
Or "hey, until we iron out the works, everyone gets first so they can play and not get fucked" maybe? 
---
I don't fucking know.
---
What they ARE doing isn't  acceptable.
---
No. Closest thing is many people are on there under their real name. Me, there's no way I'm getting my real name dragged to filth by a bunch of strangers on fuckin Facebook over pretend currency/weapons so on. It's not always the case tho, some people try to use fake accounts and scam. Courier groups get a lot of play through Facebook trades. For my part, I've done more trades than I can remember, never been scammed. I did back out of a few because I cross-referenced various black lists once i got their GT.  
---
After a while, you come to recognize people in the various groups and learn who's reliable.
---
Cranberry bog around the Prime Fissure could actually make for a neat, if environmentally hazardous, map.
---
This is like Fox News saying ‚Äúpeople are saying...‚Äù  when they want to spread a bullshit rumor to scare people‚Äôs grandparents.
---
I don‚Äôt even know what I have right now, I gotta hop on and see, but I doubt I have that
---
I settled into mine with a junkie's build, gave me a reason to get addicted to everything else and sell my Addictol instead. I live in my excavator armor like its an iron lung.
---
Sure, just as long as they bring back the atom Xmas items--whatever dummy set up the weekly sales made each set poof after only a week, instead of cumulatively adding them together.
---
I want my giant trashcan tree, dagnabbit
---
You are giving them way too much credit. Rad-rats were added to fallout 4 in nuka world, which means as DLC enemies they needed to be made ridiculously overpowered just because everything else in the DLC was too. They just didn't bother adjusting those stats when they copy pasted it all to 76. Same thing with ants and cave crickets
---
its because its people in general. For the most part every type of group is going to have idiots like that in it.
---
That shit is ridiculous but those people are just fucking idiots. Im male and I still never talk online or even go in game chat because the chances of running into idiots is almost 100%.
---
Asking for evidence of inappropriate behavior isn't 'gate keeping' dude...
---
Mole rats for me. Appearing out of no where‚Äôs. 
---
Gave me a few jump scares in both Fallout 4 and 76. 
---
Feral Ghouls close second on just jump scares. 
---
Then there is the cry of a wendigo before it lunges at you.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs unfortunate. I try to be respectful when I interact with folks online. Never understood the purpose of trying to act tough or to be a jerkoff on the internet. Nothing is gained from it otherwise.
---
Good show! That's the ticket!
---
Sounds like more lies from Bethesda....   I hope you're working on a new Engine instead of continuing your incompetence.
---
Cheerios in the microwave gross.
---
Malt O Meal, thats where its at.
---
Eventually more quests for the other factions. Such as the president quest that's been in the files forever it seems
---
I'm sorry. I really do feel bad when I find other's discomfort amusing.
---
Oh boy, I ran in to a 3 star legendary glowing death claw in there once. I must have died 20 times before I gave up and left.
---
Had it before when my main was too low level going to Whitespring at the outside hotel rooms. I learned my mistake after seeing 20+ ghouls chasing me.
---
Didn't catch the name IGN :(
---
I have hoarded together quite a lot of addictol, if you're on PC I can sell you some.
---
I got it on ps4 for 3.99 its not worth ¬£12 for that pack
---
Energy weapons don't do as much damage as they should. Plasma rifle for example, it's supposed to be doing more damage per shot than a handmade but if you actually hit something with it, it certainly does a bit less. Think tank killer perk is still screwed for energy weapons or something. Not to mention energy weapons can't land as many sneak attacks since there's no attachable silencer mod, which means it can't benefit from mister sandman perk as well. 
---
So I'd say you should move laser rifles to the bottom of the list. It's really bad. Plasma can stay tho. It is an energy weapon but awesome base stats and flamer mod make up for it. Can't say much about teslas. Only used them for pvp so there's not much to tell
---
I know. Was just trying to be as respectful to them as possible, didn‚Äôt want to seem accusatory or whatever. Replies on reddit can explode off of anything
---
You know what I haven't seen since I started is a Chameleon Deathclaw that changes colors. Haven't seen one since Beta- saw one at the Whitesprings and never since.
---
In private worlds I use a suitcase at a train station and then switch characters (also to my private world).
---
Gulpers. Way too tanky for the exp/loot they give, and the constant stagger is just annoying. Also their flailing when they get crippled makes them annoying to hit
---
FYI, saying  - "you shouldn't leave the santatron unlocked - once it's been picked once, it's left unlocked - so it could be someone else has picked it, rather than the owner making a mistake...
---
Yeah I can normally take a deathclaw in 1-2 swipes from my deathclaw gauntlet but yao guais fuck me up every time.
---
10 million players :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D Somebody is very delusional :D The number was around 800k on the first months and i'm 100% the number of players have dropped alot since then.
---
And...why is what one person said on facebook relevant here?
---
Your 2nd character's storyline is completely independent from your main, but they share any Atom shop unlocks, and FO1 benefits, which are account based.
---
Your new character will not affect anything on your first character, and yes the new character will also enjoy the perks of Fallout first
---
hopefully you dont get the two scorchbeasts glitch too. 
---
I too learned the hard way you have to complete this quest in a single go.  yikes.
---
Just dont come back. You wont be missed.
---
The majority of female characters I have seen where actually guys. I just give everyone free shit if their levels low and their clearly not an alt.
---
All depending. If you got the caps buy it. They drop often. Think I got 3-4 of them ranging from 1 - 3 star.
---
Really want the Roadster pip boy paint available again Bethesda
---
Damn....I would have loved the AAFFR .50.
---
Been trying to roll one of those!
---
Booze, coal, toys, legendary gear, and plans.
---
How do you no you will end up in the same world or can you just swap characters in the menu with out leaving that world
---
The rapper?
---
Any exclusive stuff
---
HUE HUE HUEEEEEEEEE
---
Amazing photo! :o
---
Yeah I dont know. I want to say alot of it is kids but sadly there are definitely adults acting like that as well. I pretty much ruined 76 for myself since I wouldnt even attempt to communicate  with people and just played it 100% solo which got super boring once the main quest was done.
---
Thanks :-)
---
Hell yeah.  Thanks for the crappy legendary, please get it the fuck out of... too late I got killed
---
No problem
---
Ditto
---
So why are we talking about a Facebook post on a reddit forum? Is the guy a redditor here? Then tag them. 
---
If not then... is this just for karma or what?
---
You don't get legendary gear from the presents, but you do get them from the scorched. Also get caps &amp; scrip depending on the present type.
---
I bought the razorhawks. I wish they'd add more. And bring back the no one tattoo. I missed it the first time around and haven't seen it since.
---
LOL
---
Yes. Christmas themed decoration plans, also plans that have been EXTREMELY rare until now like power armor parts, and plasma grenade plans.
---
No, the Pip-Boy is what you wear, Vault Boy is the mascot.
---
I saw the 3* I mentioned in naked white springs I would love to see the chameleon variant. Have you seen any enemies in trees or descending from a tree I see that mention about certain creatures on the wild but cant verify.
---
What type of plans?
---
all melee damage stack, you can get total of 85% or so if you role play chef for an hour üòâ
---
What if I wanna be a ghoul raider tho 'A'
---
Blasphemy
---
At this point I‚Äôm waiting for Wastelanders. I don‚Äôt mind roaming around on my own, and I have met some awesome folks while I‚Äôm doing my thing so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have more then.
---
There are a lot of rage boners from the purist /fallouters, that come in here to circle jerk.
---
I got booted from my private server when I had every workshop, and I was just going to start my loot run, when I got disconnected trying to FT.
---
I started just taking the 6-7 around the forest/ash heap, and making a circle after every time I farm scorched. I've netted around 20-40 per hour once I'm up and running.
---
I'd pay it to be a deathclaw and just terrorize the wasteland.
---
I always quit to main menu, select my other character, log back into private. It‚Äôs always the same world you left. You don‚Äôt want to log into a public first however, as that resets your private world. Also, try and do it rather quickly as I‚Äôve heard it may reset after 5 minutes after logging out.
---
You mean like the seasonal xmas tent they just did?
---
That‚Äôs another thing. The tattoos are kinda butt except like 1 imo, their all a little too cartoony for fallout as well imo
---
Add a new nuclear winter mode where it's survivors v.s. cryptids &amp; big beasts

Oh cool
---
Sorry you had to go through that. Women suffer a lot from "generalisations" like girls behave like A,B and C or girls like A, B and C. In truth , most are very different and one should take the time to know them before making conclusions.
---
That‚Äôs so great! How nice of them to do that! I just started playing today, sadly didn‚Äôt get the same response. A level 30 went for me and kept killing me so I left that server. I was level 4 and he had a legendary weapon so yeah that wasn‚Äôt fun but I‚Äôve heard how nice most people are. Can‚Äôt wait to meet them!
---
There is. I learned about weeks before people started talking about it now. It's just matter of getting it working server side.
---
God Bless America
---
You can tame random spawn animals with the lvl 3 animal friend perk.
---
Sounds good will give it ago thanks
---
If they're not going to raise it the least they could do is make a percentage of our purchases go back into the pool like the robo vendors. I hate that i will turn in items till the vendor goes down to 2 scrip and then spend 500 at mumbles but the exchange stays at 2. It should get some of that esp since mumbles gives me mostly crap i don't want.
---
US?!
---
Well that's good to no. Thanks
---
damage that you see in your pip boy includes all legendary effects and your perks. Everyone wants fixer because it's base damage is higher then combat rifle and you get bonus to stealth
---
Oh damn that would be amazing. I'd love to play that.
---
Poverty and duplicate taxidermy plans.
---
I never sold it, it‚Äôs a 2* and I‚Äôm on Xbox if you wanna buy it
---
Yeah i dont care for the ones we have currently but I'd dig more tattoos. The No One was my go to in fallout 4 but they could do arm tattoos and even leg tattoos since there's shorts outfits now.
---
We gotta eat too Smoothskin
---
They're actively removing comments and posts pointing out that people are still loosing their shit.

Fridge boy from FO4 says diffently
---
I have! The Megasloth and the gulpers can hang from trees. I've only seen a sloth in a tree once but you can always see the gulpers hanging in trees in the mire if you sneak around and don't spook them. They hang by their tails.
---
His reaction.. was fucking staged. Acting was okay. Kids got a future in it if he applies himself.
---
...you..you're absolutely right 0_0
---
I have to ask... why take so much time on that when the workshop won‚Äôt save?
---
Get in the fridge... And make sure you close the door behind you
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can‚Äôt blueprint things that aren‚Äôt connected by walls/foundations/roofs
---
Endurance increases disease resistance as well as sprint speed cost.
---
That's bad ass I haven't spent much time there other than the free states quest line. I really need to explore more. I used to just walk NV and 3 aimlessly maybe tonight I'll stroll through Appalachia.
---
You mean 5000 scrip and 150,000 caps, right.
---
I assumed there were a caps limit from 25K in the game. Are you saying there is no such limit and I could collect caps indefinitely?
---
Yes sir 'A'
---
You should. I used to spend a lot of time there because my camp was there - it's a really beautiful part of the map imo and i'm sad it doesn't get enough love.
---
I HATE THAT CAVE üôÑ
---
Hydraulic Bracers only increase Strength for purposes of Unarmed Combat...  I am not in game at the moment, but I am almost certain the blurb text for the Mod specifically states that.
---
The Power Armor Chassis increases your effective Strength to a baseline of 11 Strength.  This does not increase if you increase your Strength through levelling up or other means.  I can only assume you have a normal Strength of 1, which would be why you're showing a +10 Strength.
---
As for your 9 Strength in the Special Menu, I don't have a good explanation, as since I mentioned previously the PA chassis raises your Strength to an effective 11.  Perhaps you had a negative penalty from a disease, mutation, or something else?
---
I hope that helps clear some things up?
---
I will, maybe I'll turn up my settings and hook up my g5 to the TV. I've been dieing to hook it up to my sons I got him a 4k ultra tv it's only like 43" but I bet it would look bangin.
---
You can make several blueprints however, and so each structure in his Diamond City can be blueprinted and saved for later reconstruction.
---
I predict elections! Those voting machines are everywhere. They gotta be for something!
---
You don‚Äôt have to go to any of those radio signals just go to the glass caverns and find McTaggeddy at the end.
---
Ummm, okaaaay.... so you're asshole?
---
i sell far too many 1\*s to robots
---
Its a struggle, but must be done if I want to fast travel.
---
I think you get a low amount of atoms. I have all marked locations and I remember receiving atoms but can‚Äôt remember the amount
---
Woman here:  Can we stop generalizing that all men who speak to women about video games are toxic? You posted a snippet of this odd back-and-forth without context of any sort and are looking for a soap box to stand on. While I support that there are assholes out there, male and female, I also support that there are kind, respectful, interesting grown-up men who just want to play and talk about the game and they don‚Äôt give a damn about your gender.
---
Yeah that's some disgusting behavior. That's why I try to not let people know I'm a girl and I avoid the mic except with my close friends because it's so much easier when they just treat you like any other dude. Sorry this happened to you :(
---
That's the original Pip-Boy mascot from like Fallout 1, seen on the enamel of the Pip Boy in that game.
---
Exactly. Even if I won't use them, the fact that they are rolling in with the chance that one just might is enough to keep me interested... and that's the same loop Diablo has going for it. Drop them like candy, even if they aren't end game viable... they will have some use and that is ALWAYS better than NOTHING. 
---
This game needs to give more, even if that more isn't very useful lol.
---
Lots have mentioned #4 but, what would happen if you joined a public server afterwards?  It may randomly decide to toss out (or at least blueprint) part of your base, which would not go well, guaranteed!
---
Nice.. except for the fact those can‚Äôt exist at the same time on a single weapon
---
I don't think there's going to be an event but there's some kind of new years themed apparel that got datamined. Probably gonna be all atom shop tho.
---
Its the Pip Boy from the original.  This is the Pip Boy that was used before bethesda got ahold of the franchise.
---
I'm almost level 300 I haven't found a true treasure yet I guess.
---
It's the old design of the Vault-Boy from 1-2.
---
It is entirely client side, and server has nothing to do with it. Hence a simple relog would nullify the effect.
---
So I really need context? It was a post looking to trade a few pieces of armor for another item, I have been away from the game for a while and have no idea what‚Äôs worth what so I grossly under offered for what I was looking for, automatically get accused of trying to use the fact that I‚Äôm a girl gamer ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è no where did I say that all male players are this way.
---
I want to be a scorched more then a ghoul but damn they need to give more player character choices. "race" choice of human, ghoul, scorched should be a thing.  
---
You always start as human but can do quests and events to become the other two. ghouls can "feed" on rads filling their food and water from taking in rads. Scorched don't need food at all, but have to deal with voices around other scorched.
---
You know what I can quite easily sail through the glass caverns over and over, apart from the three mirelurk kings
---

I carry like, 10 lever guns at a time, I named them like that so I could figure which was which &amp; they all start with "1 -" so they're all at the top of my weapons
---
I miss this
---
Dont be so dramatic...
---
Ya the negative one is from a mutation. Did some more digging and found out I got hit with a year old bug bethesda claimed they fix, my strength went passed the 10 cap and I had like +30 strength and was like wtf is it always supposed to be like this? If you exit and reenter power armor it'll go back to the right stats.
---
It was in a fallout 76 group on fb, so it is relevant ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I guess if that‚Äôs what you want to call him? He‚Äôs more of a singer to me
---
So this basically also. 
---
I had this issue today getting my commendations in the bog killing the scorched and the scorch beasts and suddenly a shit load of ghouls turn up and tore me a new one. Madness how the main enemies aren‚Äôt the hardest enemies.
---
What the hell? The 10mm SMG is a "rifle"? I always thought it used pistol/smg perks..
---
Because it was in a fallout 76 group, that‚Äôs why ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Ive been trying to find a poisoners armor piece to go with my bolstering/ unyielding set.  Maybe that will do the trick...  but the Kings have some of the dirties, infested claws in Appalachia.
---
Me too
---
Ngl, I'm with you on that the assumption basically keeps the female gamers down and it's also us harassing you cause you got a pair on a game - horny nerds for you 
---
At the same time though, there are some women that do do this and it does disappoint me that people try to look for shortcuts even to the point a guy would catfish people to get legacy stuff 
---
Apologises on the behalf of my gender and I hope you actually got the answer you want if not feel free to ask :)
---
A little of both of I guess. Only ever heard one song from him. And only because my brother wouldn't stop playing it. Over and over and over.
---
I was doing the quest for rose when three of these bastards jumped me and started demolishing my health. I'm an unarmed melee build, so I had to enlist the help of my lv 307 friend. Those fishy mothers had it coming
---
Relevant to you trying to grab some internet points here maybe but that's about it.
---
Call it what you will ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Soup factory? I'm in need of levelling (currently 34) when I get home and this sounds promising.
---
r/rareinsults 
---
And I'm sorry your buddy had to go through that, it's actually both annoying and saddening to hear that 
---
Personally, as a guy, being genuine here, does it matter? Don't let the basement guys ruin your time just because you're a female, use your mic and if any guy does try just tell them to fuck off if they persist, block and jump server I can guarantee you there'll be a message saying whatever horrible stuff but just laugh at their desperation, it is fairly funny tbh
---
So you're bisexual...
---
This is problem in the gaming community, every dude is strangely nice to someone who has tits and tries to get their attention, just horny teens imo 
---
I'm a dude as well and if I hear a female voice, i don't immediately get a virtual boner and try hitting her up, I act as if it was someone new who I just met not as a potential mate you'll go further with that and make new friends that way
---
I might just be Advanced (lack of a better word tbh) for this world but human are human at the end of the day
---
It is weird that sometimes it counts, unlike killing the SB queen which never counts.  I‚Äôve tried everything I‚Äôve found on reddit, thunder mountain, on a team, not on a team, 100% repaired, etc. Nothing. 
---
So now I just do campfire tales, which is another fun way to not ever get badges.
---
Thanks. Something new to fiddle with.
---
Ran into him at the pumpkin house while I was battling a scorchbeast.
---
Ahhh, you take me back to the first days.... right after release, when we actually did have them in our camps. I think they took them out because shenanigans but who knows for true true.
---
Is that true about the railway? Should I be looking for a quad faster fire railway? lol
---
The pipe rifle doesn't double dip.
---
Because the pipe rifle has armor penetration it actually does slighly more damage than the submachine gun.
---
the laser and plasma rifles are in the correct positions.
---
Even Destiny 2 kind of did this. Everyone came from the same place, but the game has different dialogue if the account was carried from the first game vs post year 2 DLC of Destiny 2.
---
What a sad waste of time it is to Not-Play a game to get XP for the game you aren't playing.
---
I don't know about the base, but with a full stock it's a full auto rifle
---
am I the only one that dislikes it?  I prefer the current Vault-Boy (blue)
---
No that's the Robco Mascot. Vault Boy always looked the same.
---
Naw it's all good, it happens. :P
---
It's inactive, there's nothing there but some smoke leaking through the earth. Unfortunately there's no lore behind it either.
---
I agree, I'm one of them - so I've been told
---
You might just hold out til tomorrow morning and see if they change anything up. But I enjoyed it as well. I only had it for a month but I really liked it. I don't need the private servers for much but the scrap box and outfits/emotes are good.
---
That's not true. Vault Boy looks the same in Fallout 1/2. That's the Robco mascot.
---
That's the mascot of Robco, not Vault Tec.
---
Those are the ones that get left behind and have no friends
---
They're literally making an entire new main quest for free right now.
---
This is not Vault boy.
---
Yeah I only bought it for the outfit/mothman emotes. I like the scrap box but it's not worth the 12$ to me since i don't really care about the private servers and my friend bought a year so I can just go to his. I was kind of hoping there'd be a new outfit every month for it but I guess that was too ambitious. I'll grab another month when they have an outfit or something I like.
---
As others said you can just skip to the glassed caverns. I try not to use guides so at the time I wasn‚Äôt aware I could just skip to the end, but yeah doing that quest solo rubbed me the wrong way. 
---
First time I got to the 4th beacon I decided to get off. Came back the next night and Im sent back to the first one?
---
....okay? Probably just a hiccup I assumed. I start over but then someone launches a nuke because I‚Äôm just lucky like that I suppose. I fall back and just decide to try another server because I was just trying to finish the quest and didn‚Äôt feel like fighting though the nuke zone on top of it.
---
Come back, nope restarted. Go for it again and I‚Äôm disconnected. I honestly just stopped playing the game for awhile due to this and few other issues I ran into at that time. Came back recently, found out I could just skip to the end after reading something on here, and finished it first try.
---
Place your camp over a lead deposit so you constantly get lead then just grab all the weapons from monster you kill scrap it and craft ammo
---
 Then it happened.  - this cracked me up. I am so glad that guy came and helped you.
---
endurance is ap, strength is health.
---
That sounds disgusting üòÇ
---
There are some unmarked fissures. Nothing special about them.
---
Just a heads up bean - if you don't attack back - players cannot kill you or damage your camp. Higher level players hitting you are just trying to kill you for your caps/junk. Ignore them and they should go away but if not just switch servers. Hope you find some nice peeps out in the wasteland.
---
I recommend looking for an Instigating, Junkies or Furious, depending on how you want to attack. 
---
Double damage if enemy is at full health/*10% damage per addiction (max +50%)/increased damage per consecutive hit on same target.  
---
My preference is Instigating. With the right perks and high Str, you can one-shot a lot of enemies, and usually two-shot almost all the others. 
---
Faster Swing Speed or Bonus Power Attack damage are great choices for the secondary effect. 
---
+1 Strength or Reduced Weight are the best choices for the tertiary effect in my opinion. 
---
If you want to maximize your one-shot kills, I recommend an Instigating Power Attack Strength Fire Axe. Lead off with a Power Attack. 
---
Perks: 
---
* Strength: All 3 Sluggers at 3 (+60% damage), Martial Artist 3 (60% less weight, +30% swing speed)
---
* Intelligence: Makeshift Warrior 5 (Melee weapons break 50% slower)
---
* Agility: Action Boy 3, Adrenaline 5
---
* Luck: Bloody Mess 3, Grim Reaper‚Äôs Sprint 3, Luck of the Draw 3, Psychopath 3, Starched Genes 2
---
Mutations:
---
Marsupial, Speed Demon, Twisted Muscles
---
Your mileage may vary, and there are some you could add/subtract based on your play style (like, if you rarely use VATS or often use it; I like being able to ‚Äòteleport‚Äô right up to an enemy and close a gap), but this should get you started.
---
I just don't use turrets at all. I only ever have to repair like my little plastic succulents on my porch. Maybe try walling in your extractor/generator inside a concrete foundation or something?
---
Dont think anyone could put it better than you did just now
---
You could get a lead extractor or take a workshop with one. Or you could take the ammo factory for a little while (just don't stay there so people won't try to PVP and if they do just switch servers) and get ammo that way.
---
I never use them. They eat up camp budget and are ineffective against most critters.
---
76 ever being stable and bug free on such an outdated and somewhat inane method of hosting multiplayer?  
---
Pipedream.
---
I've probably done it about 30 times in the last week and nothing,I reported to Bethesda and they wanted pictures and now I've been waiting for a reply for almost 24 hours
---
Wait... ***that's illegal.***
---
Yeah... seems the Scorched/Mutants know the EXACT range at which they can sit and blow up my turrets with impunity...
---
There's a luck perk called Scrounger that lets you search ammo containers for extra rounds. Other than that there a few places you can hit for lead off the top of my head: the Lucky Hole Mine, Eastern Regional Penitentiary (disarm can traps, weights in the yard), Charleston fire department gym. Acid: Campfire Tales (best solo, blood bugs spawn between objectives), cemeteries (spawn insects), or craft a bloatfly syringer and go to town.
---
I‚Äôve gotten a lot of scrip including a few 75s from the large presents.  
---
The good news is the scrip from presents do not count against the daily limit only against the total (up to 1000)
---
The bad news is you burn up cashing in 150 daily scrip in a hurry during this event
---
I look at it like building a sandcastle. It‚Äôs fun while it lasts.
---
Yep. I had them all throughout beta release and just got tired of always repairing them.
---
I only use the heavy machine gun turrets and they do fine for me.
---
Not sure about your camp but I have come to believe mine work better up higher.
---
I‚Äôd include the explosive auto lasers as well.  They are so overpowered and glitched
---
My Beta-base had 8 turrets... lol
---
Well, in that case I am giving them too little credit, since they copy pasted with such skill that it created new variants that did not exist before. Now THAT takes skill when you just copy paste without adjusting anything.
---
How many do you use? And do you use a Spotlight?
---
Don‚Äôt use gender indentifiers in a profile.  Why would one need to do that?
---
They live in my basement üò∞
---
From the look of it, it was a trade group, which is a very different community than this place. Here you get downvoted unless you praise the game or post a silly picture or write out a questionably true story. Virtue signalling about how not to discriminate on the internet doesn't really belong here
---
Damn! Lucky you had budget for a floor. Had four and mole rates would tunnel right up to them so as not in line of fire and gnaw the crap outta them
---
I never said it was the Vault Tec mascot.  Please read more carefully.
---
The trading communities insist upon multiple accounts worth of caps for their guns if you check them!
---
Oh and just as an FYI if you‚Äôre just after the badges, I‚Äôve had much better luck getting the badges on the dailies. Stings and things and operation tidy are very quick and easy to do and drop the badges at a decent rate.
---
I had one of the first mono-foundation "T" bases... lol. And yes, mole rats ate 4 of them so regularly I was out of junk...
---
Are we on Facebook?... Listen, I have always had female gamer friends so I get why you're annoyed.... But, tons of girls act that way in games and it's quite evident girls streaming do the same if not more. A lot of people are just tired of it and not giving in to it. So if a dude gets shitty like this, just understand that he is tired of girls using their femininity to try and get ahead instead of playing the game like an actual gamer.... Those girls are what's toxic, not him.
---
That's not the Pip Boy mascot. Pip Boy always used Vault Boy images, even in Fallout 1 and 2.
---
Oh damn, they changed the name of the plagued radrat to reflect the fact that it was glowing! Truly a feat of coding skills. You may want to go replay fallout 4, the only difference in the variants is that the plagued radrat was renamed
---
I just really wanted that backpack mod,I ended up doing another challenge in the meantime.
---
On ps4 you can see someone's games and trophies unless they set it to private.
---
As a girl gamer things like that don‚Äôt even bother me and I wouldn‚Äôt even be wasting any of my time thinking about it. People say things just to be annoying online and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs probably said even worse things to other guys. It‚Äôs just some people like to cause trouble and as a girl gamer you have to be a little bit more tougher and just ignore it or even better laugh about it.
---
I like camping at an acid seep because I find it hardest component. For lead, don excavator and head into Lucky Hole mine. For steel, equip scrapper, and go kill scorched, miners or mutants. 
---
There‚Äôs a nice acid seep just south of the Monagha power plant, underneath a transmission tower. I rarely see camps there.
---
This image of the Pio-Biy shows you as WRONG.  Do not pass GO, do not collect $200.

---
Yeah, the choices were good, aside from when you meet "brainless" mobs.
---
Did you manage to get to the "no kill" end ? That's what sold the game to me. The ability to finish it without any kills, only by convincing people that you were right. 
---
No way to do that nowadays...
---
I do love the community. I only recently began playing FO76. After my first time at the Line in the Sand event around Fort Defiance (and having entered Fort Defiance afterwards to gather loot) I had to slow walk to the nearest train station as I was way overburdened. I managed to sneak past many threats, but when I got too near to Watoga a bunch of assaultrons started chasing me while firing those horrid eye-lasers at me. Running low on stims I thought that was it and I'd lose all my collected junk, until out of the blue a bunch of level 150-250's jumped in and mowed everything down. They gave a thumbs up, walked me to the station and were gone as fast as they appeared when I got there.
---
In many games I've played, players would laugh and watch, then chide you over how you did something stupid to end up that way, but the players here are very helpful and friendly.
---
And out come the white knights!! Look at them galloping to a damsel in distress. "Oh my fair lady" they whisper as they type away.
---
That's the Robco mascot. The PipBoy 2000 Mk VI has it as well, if you tilt it. The software inside the PipBoy, ie, the perk and status images, were always Vault Boy.
---
I got some reason can‚Äôt remember what the No One tattoo looks like and can‚Äôt find it on google, do you have a link to it?
---
I had one of those ;)
---
Best event ever? Yes it was, until a hacker stripped me of my equipped item. Right now, since 23 december,  my character stands naked at Berkeley Station, complete overburdened and can't fast travel anymore.  
---
" it's going to feel like a real downgrade to go back to running the same old loop again. " -&gt;  I would be happy go running the same old loop again. This would be a real upgrade.
---
My camp is at that exact place
---
What's my sexuality have to do with this I thought we were discussing ppl accusing ppl of using their gender to aid them in their dealings wtf?
---
pc?
---
I'm an animal lover myself,  i just tame and pacify everything. I also protect them. They have feelings
---
I won't truly feel better until I can be the stunningly beautiful ghoul I was always meant to be.
---
That is a good story glad someone helped out. This community and as for me is ps4 is a great community. 99.9% of players are great.
---
As a Bloodied Melee only... I agree. I have no challenge except for not becoming too cocky and letting my health get to 0. But as long as I normally just pay attention, there's literally no challenge. I 1-2 hit everything besides the SBQ or a few Legendaries that regenerate health, and even then, its just another 1-2 hits and those are dead. 
---
But... I'm scared of a nerf hitting too hard. If I have to chug 3 stimpacks per fight, then it won't be that great of a build, when a gunner can do the same damage and not have to chug any stimpacks due to their high health. It's a hard balance, one I can't think of really solving.

Deathclaw gets 1 mode, and there's no look change past the extra claw look too.... It's boring, give us more! Why can't I wrap electric wire around the talons... Or have some flamethrower mode like Boba Fett!!
---
Lmao
---
A typical game gets you between 250-350 XP and from load-in to finish it takes roughly 20 minutes. You can do the math - with the event ending at noon tomorrow you may have started too late to get very far into the rewards. Start now!
---
They were never in camps
---
Mine?
---
scrap box? None. Stash box, in the crafting area of the shopping strip on the lower level.

My wife and I both play pretty regularly, although her much more than I get to because of work and stuff. Most of her interactions with other male players seem to be split between players like that, or overly-possessive White Knight types who think she owes them something in the end. I‚Äôm honestly not sure which is worse, as I‚Äôve actually seen it break down into full blown in game arguments between her and these supposed WK‚Äôs or between multiple WK‚Äôs arguing over who deserves her attention more.
---
It would be hilarious to watch someone frog leg straight into the fissure.
---
Nvm it was someone‚Äôs camp, he had this amazing looking tent, how do you get that?
---
I've played for hours today, the games great, dunno what all the hate was about but I'm really enjoying it
---
Tau is also unmarked.
---
What? Like each one you kill gives one ? What are you saying?
---
Switch to optimized bracers for a general str boost,
---
motion assist servos on the torso also add str.
---
You're just being argumentative.  There is no source in the artbooks or the wikia that indicates that is the "Robco Mascot".  That is the displayed logo for the Pip-Boy on the enamel frame on the early Pip-boys.  
---
In fact here is the excerpted text from the history of Vault-Boy:
---
&gt;Vault Boy should not be confused with Pip-Boy, which is the name of the personal information processor used as a game interface in Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout Tactics, Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.
---
&gt;Made by RobCo, this device has its own mascot shown on the plate of the Pip-Boy 2000 in Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout 76 (with pointy ears, red and yellow jumpsuit, red hair). The 3000 model, created under a Vault-Tec/RobCo joint-venture, does not feature RobCo's own mascot.
---
Crafted ammo, especially over 5k ammo needlessly consumes weight in stash. Maybe only craft ammo as needed. Especially if you want to try using a different weapon for fun.
---
I thought you couldn't damage other players until you were level 5?
---
No turrets. They take up too much space and are currently buggy anyway. I desperately need one to protect my bot and camp but just can't swing that space needed. I put wooden fencing up to help visitors that wake up my mirelurks. The crabs break the wood right away but like you mentioned, it's cheap to repair. 
---
Does anyone use traps? They don't seem to work right for me.
---
I'm pretty sure you'll find it all under the "Stored" tab in build mode. And if I recall correctly (been a long time since I moved camp), even if you don't blueprint, things that are snapped together can be placed out again in one piece.
---
You're right, they are going to be scrapped sometime soon but OP wanted an axe and those are what I had to get rid of.
---
Man I have a junkies swing speed death tambo and it‚Äôs now my favorite weapon. I put that Halloween skin on there so it‚Äôs all eyeballs and bone spurs. Sure it doesn‚Äôt do as much damage as my axe but it‚Äôs HILARIOUS and it‚Äôs good enough
---
Even as a FO1st member, I completely agree.
---
The Scrap Box should be a quest reward.
---
They do. I got a heavy CA chest piece the other day, but it had shit effects so I scripped it. I only noticed in the first place because the DR was higher than the one I was wearing and went to the wiki to check the stats.
---
Does Xbox not have serums?
---
You need to just stop talking...   like really.
---

---
Does Xbox not have vendors?
---
I for one always leave mind unlocked to share seasonal joy for anyone who visits!
---
115k worth? Any place outside of the game Fallout 76 is fraud and run by criminals. Organized crime.
---
Fallout 76's economy in the game needs to be regulated and limiting items cap values in game.
---
if u have access to private servers, you know nobody can take them, so its fun to spend a little more time on them if you like to build. Maybe do 2 or 3 in different areas of the map and just fast travel around for free also.
---
I saw someone doing this on a body bag. The only reason I became aware that it was a live player was because my cross hairs turned red. I jumped multiple feet back like an idiot. Lol.
---
I vote they put the recipe in a cave, guarded by a Behemoth that is able to craft chems and is ALWAYS high on psycho, and viagra. 
---
And he carries a bone club.
---
Your imagination can do the rest :)
---
It gave me a reason to whip out my zealot's explosive gatling gun that was collecting dust in my stash. Threw a prime receiver on it and it pops heads like nobody's business.
---
Iirc they can't take items but can put stuff in your inventory, unless that was patched as well
---
Molerats are so weak, but having to play... well, Whac-a-Mole with them is so goddamn *irritating*. Having to wait around for them to pop up and hope you run over and kill them in enough time that they won't just dive back down again...
---
Bandolier 2. 90% weight reduction for ballistic ammo, and keep your ammo on you. Sell what you don‚Äôt use. Get rid of Missiles, Mini Nukes and 40mm Grenade Rounds unless you have a fun weapon to expend then with.
---
Do you people not know how to use the goddamned **SEARCH** function?  How many times does this topic have to pop up again, over and over again?!
---
PC. Have this as well. Don't know what the notes in stash box comments is about. I'm not holding any. Doing it as much as ever. This isn't new..right?. Hasn't this always been around when switching weapons?
---
Lol to troll and weigh people down?
---
Encountered this two times, stayed with about half of the workshops afterwards and you can use them all day.
---
Still a "great" hidden feature /s
---
People respawn, but you won't give back those presents. What's with all the idiot name calling? Cmon were all better than that.
---
Sooner or later the Grafton mayor will hold another one!
---
Lmfao..... Calm down üòÇ
---
Some things I wish I knew: Events are great and worthwhile; Live inside Power Armor (except when you're back in low level zones); Don't neglect damage bonus perks (e.g. running around with shotgun without any shotgun damage perks). And the most important - don't try to rush the story.
---
You just proved my point...all these are mascots for a brand...what are you trying to say? Or are you just being the regular kind of toxic that all Fallout 76 players are? Where they are wrong, won't admit they are wrong, and won't listen to logic and force their way through arguments? Because you have made a dozen incorrect claims by now.
---
I suppose you could, but the original idea was to trade raid power armor or something
---
As a 1st, I 2nd
---
No changes, I think this one is just good enough.
---
Mine‚Äôs bugged, so I‚Äôd just like to complete it.
---
It really was great for low level players or those with low level alts. Outside of a couple events, it's almost impossible to find decent low level legendary gear, especially stuff with more than one star.
---
Raid power armor? What's that? Like raider? You can get that anywhere
---
How about some real life fear? Hackers can fuck with your car as you drive it. People have died. Not game deaths, assholes. Real life and death stuff...people still going to drive. There isn't a group of trolls dedicated to get everyone afraid of hacked cars is there? Seems like there should be.. seems way more important than a fucking video game. So tired of these attacks and the constant smear posts. Get a god damn life, already.
---
Pip-boy is literally on the top of your own unit. Name and all, tip it downwards, you see his name and his picture on the top of your Pipboy
---
Glowing meat steak
---
Something to do with the inaccessible cabins at Whitesprings perhaps?
---
And at least a couple of new utility items that make YouTubers absolutely lose their minds about pay-to-win :)
---
Oh yeah. Frog Legs, people panicking to avoid shots, just general distraction. Plus there's not really that much in the way of good hiding spots that have otherwise clean vantage points so you're either in an open field or skulking among the river banks.
---
You could but probably wouldn't want to out them in the front. They could be your "in the rear" healer if anything otherwise there is a good chance they'd be a liability, unless the rest of your team just wrecks the vault.
---
huh?
