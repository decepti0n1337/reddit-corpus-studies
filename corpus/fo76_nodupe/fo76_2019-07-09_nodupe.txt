2000 atoms in the season.
---

---
And a season is only 10 weeks. Not 12.
---
---
---
ATX = Atom Transaction
---
MTX = Micro Transaction
---
when are these coming out?
---
Oh geez haha. Thanks a bunch for your answer, and rip for the colonel gutsy glitch lol
---
That'd be fun, especially if they added the fancy shells. I can just imagine my mates all CAMPing in the same spot and having weather wars.
---
Because it's slooooow and boring and takes too much time.  Those are my reasons anyway.   I don't find one ounce of fun in it.
---
My main aim was the star wallpaper. I got that, so now I can chillax a little bit. However, I do have my eye on the chicken coop. I doubt I will get that far on the board though, sadly. I will give it a bash, though!
---
Like for a queen fight I use my op gun once I‚Äôm 100% sure everyone got in there hits or once it mutates once. I just use it at end to help people save ammo and not waste durability
---
You'll like today's data mine once it gets compiled
---
No date confirmed.  Hopefully patch 22
---
That is f_c+1ng hilarious üòÄ. No wait ... üòÉ .. üòÅ ... Still going  üòÉ
---
We have only just finished the first week. Its not a sprint to the finish, we have another 9 weeks to go. So if you can play a lot now and get your score up, you can take a break from it later. You don't have to do all the challenges everyday to reach 100. The 10K XP score reward over a 10 week period more than makes up for anything you have missed.
---
I'm already Rank 41 and haven't even finished this weeks weekly challenges. (Mind you rank 41 is only 28% of the total score needed.)
---
I've been considering heading more towards selling junk since the ammo converter's come out. I've heard steel and lead actually sell really well because of their use in ammo crafting. Has this been true in your experience?
---
Although perhaps crafting 5.56 might be better? Unsure; would have to look into the math.
---
A lot of those were cut because there's an issue with some object states not being saved. That's why some of the Power connector switches will 'randomly' toggle back to on.
---
I hope they fix it and we get some complex conduit camps soon.
---
Vampires for 2h isn't very good because you heal based on how many hits you do. It also does no more damage than a non legendary weapon. If you want to run vampires then one handed and in particular knives are better. You would do better with an instigating or anti-armor for a full health 2h build if you don't run junkies.
---
Why tho
---
Interesting take... Call me optimistic but, I see unlimited possibilities now that we can upgrade our special point past 15. Plus cleave seems nice along with the flame and poison resist instead of flat dmg reduction. Shit, I even like the pet of the system where we have to scrap old perk cards!
---
It's just short for seven legendary perks that do the same thing, one for each SPECIAL; raise that base stat, including letting you allocate more normal perks under that SPECIAL. So for example, I could take the Legendary Strength perk and use it to equip more Strength perks like Gladiator or Slugger.
---
You can, that‚Äòs what I‚Äòm doing as well. It works without problems as your inventory is shared between public and private. 
---
Just do not leave the server when you have claimed the workshops.
---
Works with the Gauss Shotty too!
---
What do you mean level 300? You get them as soon as level 100
---
I‚Äôve never sold steel. It‚Äôs really just so common and easy to get.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm so curious as to why people Tim out of ammo so much. I figure, from what I read and see in game. A lot of players use weapons that just spark ammo all over. A lot of automatic spread style weapons. I‚Äôve tried a few and yeah they just eat through ammo. 
---
I prefer using multiple weapons. Grenades, guns and my good old axe.
---
[deleted]
---
The issue is that if you close the game, the next time you play it will default back to Find Team
---
The tower directly to the left in the pic has one at the top as well.
---
Alright thank you!
---
Yes my psn is the same as on reddit sorry bro I went to sleep
---
Because it‚Äôs Nukawinter. I, for one dislike it
---
I assume you both restarted your PS4's and checked that it showed both of you online in the PS4 friends list menu?
---
They probably thought it was replacing another weekly.
---
if you guys fuck up the brain implant card being dropped.. there will be hell to pay
---
Does ammo factory stack with ammosmith?
---
These look way more interesting than the old ones for sure, but imo Antivenom and Fire Lining should either work for Normal Armor AND Power Armor or be Power Armor Exclusive. 
---
Currently while both armor types can get benefits from Fireproof, and Normal Armor also has Dense Chest piece option, Power Armor has zero access to Poison Resist. A normal perk card in Endurance for Poison Resist would also be a great addition.
---
Also it would be cool if Power Armor Frames could have some sort of modification options like the underarmor linings.
---
Uhh, maybe the PTS forums should focus on feedback from players that are actually playing the PTS and testing the new content for themselves?
---
I‚Äôve definitely seen them since Xmas but they have always been pretty rare.
---
It has the added benefit of giving xp to the player doing the repair.
---
I wouldn't trade my fixer for literally anything this game has ever offered. Fixer is my main and a gauss mini for my queen killer don't need anything else. Have a handmade in my stash that hasn't been used in forever.
---
The first thing I could thing of was gore walls and bone floors. Nothing says "weclome home!" Like the skin of monsters and people alike being what makes up 99% of your wallpaper. Or their organs for the more adventurous types.
---
Or a wallpaper thats like a hodgepodge of logos cause you made your walls out of abraxo boxes, nuka cola packaging, and gum drop wrappings.
---
it broke a shit ton of things.. 
---
game isnt better or worse for it.. it just is
---
- Follow Me: "I found something" or "get off the bunker" or "ft to me"
---
- Rabbit: "legendary enemy"
---
- Nuke: "silo prep/launching"
---
- CAMP: "afk"
---
- Compass: "busy/soon/working on it"
---
- Moneywad: "player vendor hopping"
---
- No circle: "please get off bunker/out of my habitat/start collecting ore"
---
Wait whats PTS?
---
I know many fallout players don‚Äôt want to pvp, which is cool by me... I do. There‚Äôs no joy in fighting people who don‚Äôt want to fight back, that‚Äôs just toxic behavior. 
---
Originally they had a nearly perfect system. An entirely separate server that was dedicated pvp. No shitty slap system, no extra rewards for being there, just high consequence pvp back when you could lose a couple thousand caps, and that mattered. Same exact game, only difference is you had to be weary of strangers... I LOVED SURVIVAL
---
Then they fucked that up by adding survival only rewards, which caused a ruckus because the people who didn‚Äôt want to pvp, had to come deal with pvp, for rewards. 
---
Their answer to that problem was a half assed battle royale feature. I pvp all the time, I don‚Äôt play nuclear winter at all. Not even for the rewards. I want to play fallout, and fight my friends. Not fight my friends in a fallout themed gimmick.
---
Cringe
---
That's why you have to express yourself so that they know that is a card that people like.
---
I don‚Äôt know about him, but electrically charged/unstable isotope used to be abused to trigger unwanted PvP. I had a lot of stuff stolen in the earlier days of the game where I‚Äôd be in my stash or at a vendor and people would trigger my mutation which initiated PvP and without an active weapon or just being caught off guard they‚Äôd be able to kill you in a second or 2.
---
can i hug u pls
---
You realize most of us aren‚Äôt in the PTS right?
---
Hmm well I guess I will just stick to payday 2 or dead island. That is not the news I was hoping for
---
I think right now only PC players can use the PTS, so I don't really feel that would be fair.
---
We unlock perk slots every 50 lvls so  , lvl100 , 150, 200 ,250 and 300 
---
It seem too wide of a grind to unlock all 5 legendary perk slots 
---
They should have done it every every 10 lvls and cap at lvl100
---
Thanks for the update.  I hope you find something you enjoy better.
---
This thread is a hot take.
---
I am glad to see you thought you were important enough for your own thread!
---
Later, can‚Äôt say I blame you for you exodus.
---
I love mine too, but I borrowed a railway from a friend and was so blown away I quickly got one of my own, so now I just can‚Äôt put it down!
---
Thank you
---
Adrenaline doesn't work, white knight doesn't work and neither does gunsmith. So my armour breaks about 3 times quicker, need to fix my gun daily and it takes more shots than usual to kill mobs, other than that, it's cool :-)
---
I don't have any sources so maybe someone else can confirm but I'm pretty sure it's 6 as that's what people in my F76 groups and such keep saying.
---
I'm not in the PTS either so maybe someone who is knows&gt;.&gt;
---
Horde events. Do NOT kill the boss. As long as you kill all of the others additional enemies will spawn and they will be higher level. So even if it's a level 10 wolf boss the summoned enemies can be 50+. You should get legendary enemies every now and then. This is also good for farming certain things depending on what horde it is. 
---
I did an angler horde before and 3 3\* legendaries turned up within like 2 mins.
---
Yeah she's a bullet sponge
---
That's impressive man!
---
concidering theyre gonna add double exp weekends and double score weekends, you're only a tad behind, nothing unobtainable.
---
I didn‚Äôt realise I had to run it past you RyanG, my apologies. I‚Äôll check with you, the arbiter of all reddit from now on if it‚Äôs okay for me to post.
---
Wish there were a few in game
---
No you can‚Äôt....... you have to craft or find level 50 pieces
---
I am sure Bethesda will manage to fuck this one up as well. They've been consistent on this
---
I had a lvl 49 following me around for over an hour the other day. I think they took the team bond way too seriously. I was at my camp.for 20 minutes repairing/crafting and they just chilled there. Wierd. But it was cool that he followed me to Westek while I was grinding for score, and was there to witness them jump to lvl 50.
---
Do campfire tales. Use a Tesla rifle. Tag all the bloodbugs. Loot all their proboscis. Scrap for two acid each.
---
The battlepass grind is even worse. Even if you log in every single day and do every single challenge for 10 weeks straight, you still have to grind to complete the battlepass.  For every day you miss that grind is a few hours longer.
---
Hey so I'm having the problem where I'm literally just trying to START the damn thing. If it glitched it because I already finished flavors of mayhem im going to be enraged.
---
How far behind, you think?
---
A few of us bush wookies actually are disabled.  I'll never have good reflexes due to tendon issues, and rely on VATS in regular play.  But I wookie it up once a day for the SCORE, and I actually want the power armor skin for level 100, so I'll get there eventually.  I'm in the "no team fill" camp though.  No rush.
---
No.
---
It just unlocks at 2 dailies completed, rather than 3.
---
So, if you completed 1 daily yesterday and 1 today, it is unlocked.
---
Some gamers, like myself, don't do well or enjoy the FOMO. It's okay to leave, play something else, come back, and leave again. It's your money and time. Division 2, Destiny 2, etc all have this garbage FOMO, I just play at my pace, ignore it, and move on when I get bored. Nothing wrong with it.
---
So outdated. You need frogs. Frogs are the key man!
---
I feel like the PA perks are still lacking, but a bunch of the others, especially Master Inflitrator and Ammo Factory, are much better.
---
I'd rather not have to force myself to play a mode I hate for score. Add an adventure equivalent to it and I'd enjoy having it more.
---
Have you tried No Man‚Äôs Sky?  That‚Äôs what I got into as I find myself spending less time on fallout 76.  It‚Äôs very different and very relaxing :)
---
Nuclear Winter **seriously** needs an actual solo mode option; a mode where *everyone* queues up solo, and where there is no 1v4 BS.
---
And, yes, I do mean it as an option. The regular mode where people queueing up in teams get free kills from solo players can still exist.
---
Maybe then people going for the rewards will queue up for that mode, as well. I know I would, although I don't queue up to AFK.
---
I like no mans sky, definitely more relaxing and you can play at your own pace.
---
Does anyone have a resource that explains how these work exactly? I've been googling and reading and I've seen things saying slots are unlocked at certain levels, and others saying you cash in perk cards? And others saying you only cash in perk cards to level up the legendary perks?
---
I'm confused.
---
You're about on par for 9 days in. Here is a rough guide of which Rank to aim for at the end of each week.
---
Week 1    19.  
---
Week 2    32.  
---
Week 3    44.  
---
Week 4    54.  
---
Week 5    63.  
---
Week 6    71.  
---
Week 7    79.  
---
Week 8    86.  
---
Week 9    93.  
---
Week 10 Done and have your 3 week break...
---
Looking to offload your gear? üôÇ
---
Sometimes it means someone on another team has already unlocked them. Other times some safes/terminals are randomly unaccessible.
---
God. This is perfect. Don't quite get the legendary specials?
---
No. I did them all today
---
Yep
---
Public test server
---
Ive uninstalled it from my PlayStation at the moment, when I can be bothered I‚Äôll post a thread here for whoever wants it. Nothing special tbh
---
I thought it‚Äôs +2 for all of these. Where did you get these numbers?
---
Absolutely - as long as you're signed up for the Fallout 1st Elite program - only an extra $30/month on top of Fallout 1st.
---
More seriously, we don't know. Since I suspect everything about your character is stored online, chances are if they offer a PS5 version, you'll be able to play your characters there. 
---
I think our best worst-case scenario is that Fallout 76 will work in backwards compatible mode. So you just fire up the PS4 version on your PS5 and go that route. I would be rather surprised if you couldn't play with "native" PS4 players in that mode.
---
I feel a bigger question would be whether or not there even will be a PS5 version of Fallout 76. And then if there is a PS5 version, how much Bethesda is going to charge to upgrade to it? Once we know whether or not it exists, and how much it costs, then we can start asking about whether there will be cross-generation play.
---
Don't really care if it's cringe, I play solo and the new format punishes solo players.
---
Seems outdated but people have been talking about recent dupe. Doesnt really matter. No clue what the frogs thing means
---
I am fairly certain last go around people that didn't test the perks on the PTS were giving their feedback. This is such a gaming changing aspect, everyone should voice their views.
---
What about those people that love NW?
---
You want them to force them to spend an extra amount of time in Adventure Mode, when they would prefer to spend it in NW?
---
You already have Adventure Mode equivalents. Several of them. Just one weekly is for NW.
---
As I said in the post; not everything is about you.
---
I‚Äôve been testing it, i still keep getting more xp the more intelligence I have
---
meh beacause i love my nuka cola t51b but lvl 30 is not really cool
---
Did it actually charge you caps, or say that it was going to charge you caps?
---
I‚Äôve tested this about five times, and my cap count stayed the same. 
---
And you can place a FT mat at each workshop you control.
---
I'm XB1 anyway... I was just giving you a hard time. I took a 6+ month break last fall and thought I'd never play again. Joined a Discord group with alot of good people and that got me back motivated to play.
---
And it didn't reward me until the full 3/3
---
Lol I‚Äôm tired of Bethesda creating systems for players to grind only for entitled players to bash them for not being how they want them to be. Just because it‚Äôs too hard for you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad system. I have 2 characters. One who‚Äôs 350+ and another who‚Äôs 200. I can tell you that there is no way in hell I‚Äôm making let alone playing more than 2 characters just because it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äútoo much of a grind‚Äù to some players.
---
wait er*** is working again, omg i need this for adventure
---
Made my own spreadsheet to calculate it, each of the ranks I have chosen once you start to progress through them is 10% of the total needed.
---
I understand that not many people like pvp I don‚Äôt really like it myself but at least put an effort they act like it doesn‚Äôt exist
---
They have definetly upped the drop rates on these items. in two days, both me and a friend got these, and my other friend got the leather coat last week.
---
Agree
---
I suppose I never know, I did say I think I‚Äôm finished. Plus Elder Scrolls 6 is a long way away.
---
LUL ‚ÄúCleave‚Äù is variant of a D&amp;D attribute &amp; plus the other thing is I have to go change my shorts now because Legendary Ability ( Àò ¬≥Àò)‚ô•
---
A lot better than before. Neat.
---
If you have to ask that... OOOOOOF!
---
Just kidding. 
---
People are just so obsessed with this score thing. Like. It wont be the end of the world if you don't get every reward. There's people who are very far ahead of you (and will continue to be). There's people very far behind you (and will continue to be). That doesn't change where you are. If everyone was 20 places ahead of you what could you do apart from grind xp like a lunatic? Nothing. 
---
There's like 2 things i actually want. The glow in the dark wallpapers. That's it. The currency and lunchboxes will be nice. But i'm not gonna push it. I'm just playing the game and if i get to 100. Great. If i don't. Great.
---
Yea I'll post proof after tonight I can get to 67 I think
---
&gt; Detonation Contagion - enemies killed by thrown explosives have 20%/30%/40%/50% chance to explode
---
Is the Fat Man included in this or is it only stuff like grenades?
---
ugh
---
[removed]
---
Me personally? Can‚Äôt use vats. I‚Äôm terrible at FPS games and could not get through any fallout without it
---
What are those picture frames you used?
---
Not on PS4 takes me a minute or two and when I search again I find the exact same teammates
---
Same! I finally tracked down the Raider Punk and I had just finished a Gramps quest and turned it in, so there was none active.
---
I can craft you a new one for caps if you want with the same paint job and even mod it if you‚Äôd like?
---
Great improvement.. So many good perks!  I've got 4 characters: lvl 150, lvl 138, lvl 90 and lvl 82.. Looks like I gotta pick one and focus dammit haha. I'll probably just try to get my lvl 150 to 200, then relax
---
One they need is one for bloodied builds or you know in other words one that people would actually use.
---
One can be like Scorched genes with how you can't get mutations, but can't lose them to, but for radiation. You gain a lot fewer rads how ever the down side is that rad away and rad removing perks no longer get rid of rads.
---
They can call it. The Power Of Atom
---
This is why I always aim the nuke so the north of the bunker is in the nuke zone, but not the open field east of it. There are so many fail tents in that spot that make everything miserable.
---
That's amazing. Still farming the hell out the events so my friend can get them too. But congratulations on your drops üòäüòä
---
Build the cabinet or dresser first. I personally use the long metal cabinet. I BUILD a flamethrower trap. Under defences. I burn/destroy the cabinet. Then I place the tinker workbench where the cabinet was. I place it down and align it properly. Then I just ‚Äúrepair‚Äù the cabinet I burned down with the flamethrower. And boom. Your tinker workbench will be inside the cabinet.
---
Just like the real world, the game world has angry selfish people as well. That being said, I think there are more good people than bad. Also, the grumpy ass should have locked his purifiers, so it's his fault.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
p.s. LEvel means nothing really. lot of low levels I run into are actually not low level players, they are just on a new toon.  So you can't assume someone is new and lacks knowledge.
---
Not sure what actual method they use in that particular example but theres 2 ways I know of to get objects inside other objects.
---
The first involves building one item then destroying it with the flamer trap and then building the second object over the spot and repairing the first.
---
The second involves finding a piece of terrain that allows the shelf to clip into the ground a bit. Build it then build the 2nd object on top of it. You then select the bottom object and the top one will drop down into it a bit. You need to keep repeating the selecting until it reaches the desired position and you also need to fiddle about to adjust the height it drops
---
stupid bot...
---
I have the pebbles the cat one and will never use it but it is a pretty great skin
---
Some people are total control freaks. They should know better than to play an online multiplayer game, with real people who they can't control, but it's actually pretty funny that they were so upset over something so minor. Pun half-ass intended. The new fertilizer makes that completely irrelevant too! Hopefully your son will play more, realize he did nothing wrong, and be able to laugh about it too.
---
I had my ally in the forest camo jumpsuit,  but I had a nightmare she lost it, so I put her in something else-- the glow in the dark skeleton suit that I can remake if needed.
---
Leave him alone, he was just offering you a hug, damn
---
Eh. I do agree, but I enjoy battlepasses, and I like the rewards this season. No, it won‚Äôt be the end of the world, but if I can do it, I want to.
---
People who haven‚Äôt actually taken part in the PTS should not be giving their feedback at all. The whole point is to **test** the new features.
---
Same for me....unlocked one of the other atom challenges and I got my week
---
Well tbh I don‚Äôt think they would be yelling at him if they knew he was a kid. But that‚Äôs how some video games are lol.
---
the 4 responders caches in the train yard from the mini quest in adventure are all locked safes in nuclear winter.
---
Was that one an atomic shop item?
---
Congrats, but then there are some people that got it all for 1 gold each:/
---
Crud. Where can I find / buy the flamethrower trap?
---
Huh. Alright. Weird, there was that guy the other day that said the +2 levels. You know what I‚Äôm talking about?
---
So my permanent 6 legendary perk cards would be 
---
Strength Legendary Ability
---
Endurance Legendary Ability
---
Agility Legendary Ability
---
Master Infiltrator
---
What Rads?
---
Ammo Factory
---
Not wasting Perk Card Coins to swap in/out Ammo Factory and also yeah PA users your not getting much this time but IIRC they will be adding more Legendary Perk Cards later
---
The sad thing it wasn't even purifiers, he said it was just two crops that were next to the road away from the CAMP. Easily mistaken for something you could just come across if it was something like mutfruit or berries.
---
I‚Äôm definitely not entitled and I‚Äôm done my fair of grinding as an mmorpg player 
---
Time consuming grind =/=  achievement/rewarding
---
And this is definitely from rep , score or gold grind 
---
Other then the legendary slots there is no point in lvling pass lvl50.. special point cap at lvl50,  gear caps at lvl50  And they adding lvl sync  in September
---
Here are two videos on merging items.
---
[one](https://youtu.be/vJwmP20hsMQ)
---
[two](https://youtu.be/Np1ew_w0stU)
---
I believe you're right. Nevermind. Leave grahm and his moo moo be. Ha
---
I love surface to air and distant thunder. STA can gen like 4 or 5 SBs if you are quick, and distant thunder can be super fast. I also like A Real Blast ... good speed and spawns.
---
If you dont have max rep yet, I'd suggest hitting the assault spawn points in rotation too.
---
Also, I know you mention burrows, but Harpers Ferry in general also is solid.
---
Born Survivor is simply a must!
---
I‚Äôm all for that. However I wouldn‚Äôt want that creepy voice face in my camp
---
Thanks
---
Or you know, improve builds other than Bloodied to incentivize people trying something else.
---
I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt hear more people talking about the chicken coop! I‚Äôm so excited for that one camp object in particular to complete my homestead (for now at least!
---
ok thanks
---
Yep. I didn't even have the backpack and I bought skin, finally got to use it just after wastelanders dropped
---
It is for consoles, not PC yet. MS haven't put the PC version on their store.
---
Honestly I think most players dont give a shit. He was just unfortunate to strike one of the handful that apparently do. If they dont want people touching their crops or water then they can and should lock them behind something. If its out in the open and unlocked then its fair game as far as Im concerned. Most players leave it that way because they want them to be available to low levels, specially in that area
---
I love the new vendor, but I really want weird, new kinds of vending. More robots? Hell yeah. But not reskins of the same ones we have. The Slocum's Joe bot is super cute, but I don't want five different varieties in various colors with different foods inside. MODUS would be amazing.
---
I'd love a space or rocket themed one to go with the new wallpapers!
---
Thank God for Legendary Ability. Now us sneak pistol builds won't be strapped so thin. Bless.
---
Wow that sucks. Thanks for the info
---
what's your platform ?
---
Well they do.
---
Oh, sorry about that
---
Darn I have even done the rep glitch and still not allies with the raiders. Thank you
---
If you think that's bad, wait until you start logging in to find the majority of your daily and weekly challenges have completed themselves and awarded you nothing
---
I hope so as well. I'm really trying to get him away from games like Roblox and others where you don't really have an objective and into tougher games where you have an actual goal and feel like you are accomplishing something. He is actually really good at games, but he keeps being drawn to the simple ones that his friends play too.
---
Yea that‚Äôs the only one I know of too.
---
Oh I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Yes I completed mine yesterday it was a new character so I easily completed 3 nw challenges and they counted
---
welll you asked, but most people don't like NW, Like myself. I just ignore them, but I also don't want to see them, a filter would be nice.   I would prefer they just gave me more weeklies instead of trying to coax me to play a mode I really don't like
---
Never understood why people get mad about it to be honest. Yelling at someone over it is a mental issue in my opinion (they need anger management). Crops grow back fairly quick, and purifiers produce water pretty quick as well. I don't like playing with kids, but I'm not gonna go be a dick to anyone because it's possible that they're just a child. Unless I hear that it's an adult, then square up buttercup, I'll fight you! Not really. But I hope that asshole didn't ruin the game for your son and he continues having a fun filled adventure.
---
NW winter pvp is arguably more popular than adventure mode pvp. On PS4 it's always full lobby with less than a 90sec queue around the clock.
---
I don't want to pvp **at all** in adventure mode and i'm glad it's near impossible to kill unwilling participants, but i do enjoy NW on the side and i would like to see it expanded.
---
This
---
that is really interesting, and i got that bug  too. i created a one punch saitama themed character and when i logged on, i find my character had beard and or hair which he is bald completely. lol
---
Most do, yeah. The only ones that don't are consumables or things like caps and bullion. When you claim the reward in the Legendary Run menu it goes to the character you're on, or if you're on the main menu it'll go to whoever you played as last.
---
My guess is it goes to the character your playing with when you press claim
---
As soon as I posted my question, I had my "duh" moment and edited it.
---
Before this post, I'd just discover every location and run-n-gun from the vault all the way to the Red Rocket in Flatwoods.Today, I did like you suggested originally and it worked like a charm.
---
 Many thanks for the tips. :)
---
Updoots to the moon!!

No worries! I'm looking forward to it when it does though :)
---
Ima a gunslinger main myself. But we will still be strapped. The new perks dont change the 15 special cap unfortunately
---
I am happy enough for the train diner car but Id still really love the rail carriages and buses we had in FO4. One of my favourite homes in that game was a school bus on a platform over the water at Sanctuary away from dickhead settlers. id love to recreate that somewhere in this one
---
Ps4: yesterday when I did my daily it went to 2/3 on the weekly. Then when I got my 2nd lock picked it completely. Still had to play one more round to finish the daily tho
---
I enjoy NW myself, and ive had a lot of fun in it.
---
I just see no point in messing with adventure mode as it just becomes a contest of whose got the most nuka quantums
---
The scrip limit is what's zapping my enthusiasm for the game. 150 per day is a real kick in the peener
---
We need to make a petition for the confetti mess effect be a perk or legendary perk. I for one would use a slot for it
---
Those chems are pretty nice!
---
It should definitely be available on all platforms, PC only is ridiculous
---
Like on a flat roof or an upper floor? Id say not because it has its own foundation I think
---
If that is what it means, I am happy to see that Bethesda actually used multiple of my ideas for legendary perks lol.  Hopefully they will pick up a few more of them
---
That was a glitch that was only on PC, and I think it was only able to be done on release day
---
Don't we have to grind for plans? Maybe make it something unlockable.
---
This literally only impacts bloodied builds.  Given how many damned synergies that build has already, it doesn't need more.
---
Bethsda has been slapping the community in the face for a long time now. Two wrongs dont make a right, but this is more of a defense case. You slap somone expect to be slapped back, monetize, lie, monetize, small content update monetize monetize, ignore what the community wants. Bring annoying broken products, resell content from other games, broken products being ammo converter. They dont even try to be creative about anything they do, fo1st came with a armour from another game. The end of the pass the Cosmo PA skin came from fallout 4. They keep monetizing the same content every game, why shouldnt people just take it with glitches? They made themselves a gta 5 clone ( no real content no end game) they get the same player base glitch and break everything to enjoy the game.
---
Yay bugthesda. I didn't get the the NW challenges because I wanted to finish all the other weeklies first, aside from the dailies so I wouldn't get the autocomplete bug.
---
Not yet. After this week you will be able to. It becomes available 2 weeks after the start
---
I didn't do 1 daily for nw since this has started an I completed the 10k xp a few times maybe 4. This not even a grind. Literally no effort to get to 100. If need be I can easily spend some atoms to get to 100 as I have 1 year of fallout 1st and nothing to buy with my atoms.
---
Get it as high as you possibly can then spend the atoms on the last bit you need before the season ends
---
The levels all cost 150 atoms, but the required score goes up with each level
---
So buying higher levels is better value
---
The 14th should be when we're able to do this. That will be 2 weeks from when seasons launched.
---
I mean, I took down that guy and moved on to the others. I think the ‚ÄúAttacking!‚Äù Thing came up but I‚Äôm not sure. They started shooting back at that point.
---
*stab* et tu brutus? But seriously, good idea.
---
You' also forgot a separate solo only mode.
---
It gets tiring to constantly make it to the last 5 only to die to a team 90% of the time.
---
I agree they should try to get feedback from as many players as possible.
---
We used to be able to buy them from the enclave. I‚Äôve never had it drop for me but I‚Äôve also never got the ultracite emergency protocols either even though I know that‚Äôs a drop.
---
I got them last night, it's only taken about 90 SBQs!
---
I turned my handmade into an automatic and enjoying it so far.  Also have a fixer that I like as well.  Really depends on what ammo I have.
---
you call a minute "dead" ?
---
I got the points so it could be worse
---
You realize pretty much every game with a PTS has it for PC only. Companies usually have to jump through way more hoops to get an update through on consoles and from my understanding it's more costly. As a console player I've accepted that it's much more logical for the PTS to be a PC only thing.
---
Some improvements to be sure, but what's up with Retribution?  The old version buffed your damage if you blocked, now it gives a minuscule hp and ap regen?  Unless you can stack it a bunch of times, that seems pretty garbage unless they're turning this into a MMO and adding a tank spec /w taunt abilities lol
---
I agree. I absolutely hate PvP but I think survival mode was vastly superior to having NW, where they basically have to maintain two games. I wish they never did NW and just focused on fixing bugs in adventure/survival mode.
---
A very wise idea nice oneüëç
---
I don't know if they can, but adventure mode should have just those quest for adventure showing. And logging into NW should show just those ones. I mean, I get having one menu but I don't see why they can't have two separate ones.
---
I've had this a few times and couldn't pinpoint why. I thought it came from Lover's Embrace but that's only 5%. My guess is lunch boxes? I'd love to know too.
---
Come on now, you can't be *that* bad...
---
True, still, it hurt to see when I found out
---
Best advice. I‚Äôm already at the point score required for levels has doubled from the first, so it‚Äôs gonna be a real slog at the end when it takes your weekly to even rank once.
---
This isn‚Äôt a case of ‚Äòself defense‚Äô. That‚Äôs a preposterous claim. 
---
If a merchant doesn‚Äôt fulfill their side of a contract, you don‚Äôt come back later and vandalize their store. 
---
If you don‚Äôt like the way a merchant conducts their business, then you file a claim against them if you have a civil case, and/or you take your business elsewhere. 
---
This is still you being an apologist for breaking the rules. 
---
Both sides are wrong. End of story.
---
Did you not read the other part I find the exact same teammates and when I keep getting matched with same people yes it‚Äôs dead
---
More than it was worth.
---
I didn't forget I just have a long long list of reasons it sucks in general and reasons it sucks as a br. If I talk about all the reasons its bad ima end up writing a 12 page essay.
---
Is this on the pts mate?
---
About once a week my game will freeze the audio and bounce it back to the dashboard to restart the game.
---
Maybe, it would be nice if everyone could use the PTS, but given how big this change is to the game, it definitely shouldn't be only the feedback from PC players. Everyone needs a voice and to be honest, I don't think Bethesda is going to sour on the additional feedback, I think they want it.
---
Yep, on now.
---
Yep lunchboxes. One of the random bonuses you can get from one
---
I got my purifiers right next to the road, my collectron gathering food with a "free food" sign on it and my garden right out in the open for everyone. Everything is unlocked and I encourage visitors to take whatever they need. 
---
Some people are just greedy and selfish I guess. Sorry about your son's experience. Most of the folks that play are very generous with stuff.
---
Haha
---
&gt; maybe recieve something like 10% discount over time for visiting there and doing daily/weekly tasks. 
---
Please no. We do not need more daily chores in this game. Bullion, Rep and SCORE are bad enough.
---
Ah cool, are there any legendary perks that would be good for a bloodied commando?
---
So both agree this bethsda fault alone, I'm glad we can see eye to eye on this one my freind :)
---
This is such a pain in the ass. The boxes always say Inaccessible for me, taking hours to get this shit done with having to reload constantly.
---
That was my favorite part of PA heavy: an actual use for 15 int, especially with a gatling laser. Kinda miss it, but RNGesus decided to giveth a god roll power fist. Now gotta dress up for the part of one-punch man.
---
So long as it's playable and with fast queue times it's not dead, same people or not.
---
Yeah I do, but I still dislike it lmao, Pubg manages a pts for Xbox, and companies do betas through the Xbox insider program quite often, like Obsidian's Grounded beta a few weeks ago
---
I don't play PS4 but I have to imagine they have similar systems set up
---
And I don‚Äôt play much br‚Äôs anymore but when I do it takes seconds to find a game
---
Tomorrow at noon is when it starts I do believe.
---
Damn, that's one sexy buff.
---
They're assholes-- plain and simple. My response would have been a resounding "Eat excrement." I would have taken as much of it as I could to ~~piss off~~ aggravate the user and blocked said user on the platform...
---
He shouldn't have to deal with this nonsense, though, and by and large, most people are fine in this overall community. There are jerks, though, and it sucks he's got to learn this way.
---
I always mute my mic so there's no background noise being heard. (My game setup is next to my washer and dryer and it is NOT quiet) but I have listened to convos and people singing badly along to their radios and people eating crunchy foods (ick!) and nobody has ever said a word about it.
---
I leave all of my stuff unlocked and free for the taking at my Camp. I appreciated the help when I was starting out, so I have plenty of crops planted free for the taking, as are water purifiers, Collection Station, etc. Idk what platform he's on, but my camp is always free to access on Xbox.
---
I'd say 99% of people are helpful and offer assistance where possible.
---
Oh.... trust me. It‚Äôs bad. I have never been able to play anything besides stealth sniper and commando because of how bad I am at aiming. 
---
If you took away vats it would take me close to 10 shots just to kill a radroach
---
You see you are my favorite kind of people
---
Don't think it drops anymore.
---
I don't mind if people help themselves to some of my crops. I have a lot. I have 18 corn growing (plus other stuff). With green thumb i get 36 corn. That keeps me in corn soup for a long time. So when i come back to my camp and find that someone has taken every single piece of corn i go 'why?' and then i have to eat spoiled stuff which as a herbivore is perfectly fine.
---
So they got rid of the dmg reduction for a full heavy/sturdy/light set for poison and fire resistance... that's dumb as fuck...
---
It‚Äôs ok not to like the grind, it isn‚Äôt for everybody. There are lots of different kinds of players. If you like the overall story and just want to play that content when it comes out, then move on to other things til the next big drop, do that.
---
I set my prices low. Most everything I have is below 200 caps. Some may call it junk. Me, I call it treasure.
---
They could just lock it. Other than that, I‚Äôve rarely ever heard anyone talk over the mic in area chat. I would say less than 5 times in all my hours playing.
---
Ugh if I had a dime for every time I have heard that lol be a rich man
---
I don't disagree with you there. In an ideal world they would allow anyone who owns the game on any platform and has a PC access the PTS. 
---
I don't think Bethesda is only looking at the PTS forums though for feedback. They absolutely have people that frequent this subreddit and any posts about Legendary Perks that gain enough traction will surely be seen by them.
---
Ok cool thank you
---
Yes. You can now use your 6 legendary slots(1 slot for each ability) to increase your special lineup. It‚Äôs still maxed out at 15, but all your abilities not maxed out, you can put into.
---
Also, the follow through ranged 10% damage+ increase is still there.
---
Yeah some of them are pretty awesome. Ive opened a couple at SBQ's but Im trying to save all mine for the double xp weekend and intend to share the love around then.
---
Yeah. Got caught a few times by that. I usually leave the lobby and try again
---
...as opossed to not having a discount towards atoms, er ok.
---
I‚Äôm beyond thrilled for the infiltrator perk.  QOL is the top of my list.
---
I guess we just have differing views on what a grind should be. If I were to be maxed at level 100 with nothing else to do then I would have my 5 characters slots full and maxed just for the sake of it. I could do that in a week. With the current system, we do have a reason to grind past 50 and even 300. Then we also don‚Äôt have to have multiple characters just for the sake of it.
---
less than a day
---
how the F\*\*\* you put ground stuff in a wall?
---
Too bad it's only for an hour. Imagine that buff lasting for a day!
---
Not what I said at all, but nice try. 
---
Perhaps English isn‚Äôt your native language. That may explain your difficulty in comprehension. 
---
Allow me to be more direct. 
---
The players that use glitches and hacks are violating their ToS; this is wrong, and anyone that supports it is wrong. 
---
Bethesda has failed to deliver upon promises and uphold their end of the agreement in full: this is wrong and anyone that supports it is wrong. 
---
**Both sides are wrong.** There is no valid justification for either party. 
---
Your refusal to acknowledge that is what makes you an extremist apologist. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Yes, the scrap ratio and perk card upgrade cost is far too high.  At high levels, you only get 1 perk card pack every 5 levels, with each pack containing 4 cards (not counting special sources, like the season pass).  At level up, you can also choose a card.  So basically every 5 levels, you get 9 cards total.  If it is still only 1 coin per rank 1 card, that is 9 coins.  That means in order to scrap enough cards to rank up a single card, you need to gain approximately 56 levels to generate enough cards to scrap (assuming it remains 100 per level and doesnt increase per level).  That seems like far too much of a grind considering there are 6 cards with 4 ranks each.  Granted you could probably get by with some cards being rank 1 (like the hack/lockpick one)
---
oh, yea, true
---
Yeah exactly lol I'm hoping to get 90 and just use the 1500 from the season to finish it off
---
I'm new to this forum and haven't seen it yet. I just randomly thought of it. Ha
---
I hope so, I am just trying to get more people involved, I have been a gamer long enough to know it is not good when player feedback comes from just a small group of people.
---
You may not class that as dead but it is a major problem when in other br‚Äôs they‚Äôre completely different players
---
Thanks mate
---
Yup pretty much my exact thoughts. Gonna be hard to pass on more perks for my build and I think pretty much everyone could say the same
---
And you can place three of them! :D 
---
The train car is amazing too.
---
Yeah like the other person said once we get high up it'll be an unbelievable grind, it feels slow already lmao
---
I like the party confetti dead animation üòà
---
It's from Skyrim. Pretty much every shop in that game the shopkeeper says it lol
---
See, I found I don‚Äôt open much stuff anymore. But for QOL for me, I absolutely love the new ammo perk.
---
With that, I can pretty much supply all my characters ammo needs.
---
Maybe they don't want sorched spawned by scorchbeasts to be legendary but can't figure out how to separate them from normal scorched.
---
I don't even know there was a Camo Secret Service Jetpack? Do you get it from Regs?
---
I understand that, though updating NW isn't suddenly gonna force people to play it, at least not more than they have to aside from the daily anyway.
---
I play 95% of the time in adventure mode and and i'd be happy to have both modes updated somewhat reguarily (with PVE getting priority and most ressources though).
---
Those who don't want to play NW simply won't but don't take away the prospect of having new things added to it simply because of that.
---
I am excited for this also. Two backpack skins in this season.
---
I saw my first legendary scorched two days ago, after just over 200 hours on my character. Until then, I just figured they didn‚Äôt exist.
---
The plans used to be pretty rare. From forest events, iirc. But they were massively duped with the holiday presents, so now you can pick up the plans pretty cheap sometimes.
---
The tomahawks are pretty heavy but do like 33% more damage than knives. So they‚Äôre pretty boss. But throwing knives are the real MVP.
---
Yeah, I thought they‚Äôd do this when I saw the initial pics. Would‚Äôve been a nice touch.
---
The majority of the rewards are for adventure mode.  Would make sense to have the challenges focus mainly on that.
---
Alright to clarify, the range stat on weapons is actually mostly meaningless as far as your question goes. Some of my numbers may be misremembered, as it has been a while and I cannot find the original datamine thread these were in when I learned of them, but I have done my best to give a general overview. Gain of salt advised.
---
There are three stats that effect the performance of your gun at range, I can't remember the exact names, but i will refer to them as dammin, dammax, and vrange
---
Vrange is the one that the game shows you, and this is a number that effects your vats accuracy, increasing or decreasing it as you get farther or closer to the enemy. That is all that number refers to, as to what it's measuring it is a %, 200 means twice as likely to hit compared to a baseline 100. What a 100 is I don't know, there are too many confounding variables and I don't have the skills or knowledge to figure out how to data mine the base values.
---
Dammin is the minimum range before your weapon starts to lose damage, and dammax is the range where your weapon drops to the lowest possible damage (1/2), these are hard stats that are attached to the barrel of your weapon, and are invisible. There are 4 main versions of these stats that are copied and pasted across various barrel types, though a few weapons have unique stats.
---
shortest (10-20m) is found on sawn off and stub type barrels, it's simple, if you are in 10meters of an enemy you deal max damage, if you are beyond twenty you do half (less than half because of how armor works in practice)
---
short (15-25) found on most short barrels, and on some medium barrels for weapons with stub or sawn of barrel options
---
medium (20-35) found on most medium barrel weapons, and some long barrels for weapons with stub/sawn, and some heavy modifiable weapons.
---
long (25-50) most heavy weapons, long barrels, and sniper barrels have this damage profile, and is generally ideal.
---
In general weapons will be one of these 4 categories, though some fall outside or between them, one notable exception I know of is the dragon, which has something silly like 50-75. Overall you should always, always, ALWAYS take the long barrel option every single time without exception because short barrels are already doing minimum damage at the same range long barrels start to suffer any sort of damage fall off. Perks and stuff that boost range do boost fall off distances correctly (or they did, a lot of things are broken this patch though, so who knows), while silencers and stuff only effect the vats accuracy component.
---
The range number you are shown is useful because it is usually similar to the range falloff in terms of barrels relation to each other on the same weapon, so if you have a 100, 150, and 200 barrel the 200 one probably has the better hidden damage fall off stats.
---
Well they shouldn‚Äôt... and encouraging people to provide feedback on something they haven‚Äôt tested is irresponsible.
---
They absolutely truck certain mobs too. Iirc, they do shockingly well against mirelurks and crap.
---
Alright thanks
---
To my knowledge there aren't any games that have an actual PTS on ps4 and BETAs are a different story entirely. Either way, there may be exceptions to the rule, but that's what they are. Exceptions. For most companies it's more feasible to have their PTS be PC only.
---
They may also receive Instigating bonus? I was seeing some odd stuff with them when I had an instigating bow equipped?
---
That‚Äôs my aim too. I‚Äôm in the mid 30‚Äôs so it‚Äôs gonna start being a pain when the rapid levelling stops, but having those ten levels for ‚Äúfree‚Äù as well as already being ahead I‚Äôm hoping I can cut off a lot of the end stuff. 
---
I have about 5k atoms I can throw at it too, thought I‚Äôd prefer not to and will only do so if I feel I hit the wall regarding being bothered to log in every day and do the same thing over and over. 
---
For now I am happy to trundle on and see what happens. I‚Äôll definitely abuse the double xp weekend at least firstly.
---
This probably sounds really stupid, but what is noon?
---
12pm EST
---
Thank you!
---
Dude, I know, forgot about the fusion core recharge perk as well.  As a full health heavy build those two will be beyond useful.  I main an AAE flamer, and fuel crafting is always an issue, secondary is a tse gatling laser which in theory will have unlimited ammo, at a minor inconvenience of swapping fusion cores from PA to the weapon.
---
You're very welcome üñ§
---
This is where the confusion is 
---
You unlock slots to equip legendary perks at every 50 lvls .. we still have to lvl those perks up via perk coins By scraping perk cards into coins 
---
There your grind  lvling up the legendary perks
---
Glad you figured it out! It‚Äôs a nifty little exploit but man does it EAT budget
---
Does Ammo Factory work with Ammosmith? If I‚Äôm missing something let me know I haven‚Äôt paid much attention to legendary perks.
---
I haven‚Äôt used power armor since release. Losing my Unyielding/backpack carry weight buffs hurts.
---
A human tank should be able to carry more than my half naked dude.
---
Just know that certain things have to be in your known plans as well to build!
---
Happy building!
---
It took me a while to figure out how to use wallpaper
---
Preston Garvey liked that.
---
Yep worl together,  as does super duper
---
Survival would have never worked the way it should have so long as it didn't require to create a survival mode only and non transferable character, Allowed legendaries and did not have a proper  spawn point immunity, amongst other things.
---
Nice! Can‚Äôt wait to abuse the shit out of that lol!
---
This has changed since the system was first put out. Give it a few days and we‚Äôll know for sure.
---
It also doesn't help when that feedback comes from the wrong part of the community though. Some of the worst changes this game have seen have come from Bethesda listening to the wrong groups of players. 
---
While I agree those of us that haven't played on the PTS can offer some feedback, I also think our opinions are limited without first hand experience. Sometimes a change that sounds good on paper doesn't translate well to gameplay, and I know there's people on here that have some confusion on how a few of the perks work. 
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is non-PTS players should have a voice, but it's not unreasonable to expect the PTS players feedback to carry more weight.
---
So if I don‚Äôt have the plan, someone else still can‚Äôt build one at my camp
---
Yes, now there is. This wasn't there when I submit my tickets.
---
Exactly. I honestly think that Bethesda nailed what walking tank power armor should be in Fallout 4. Almost indestructible, high carry weight. Bethesda should add in one more perk to buff PA carry weight.
---
Yeah, I don't get why bethesda would go through the trouble of making some guns when they have almost no practicality. (Like the Single Action Pistol. It looks awesome, but it's not practical) 
---
I like this idea. The powder weapons are some of the most unique in the game. They should be buffed, atleast.
---
As others have said, if you intend to focus on .45 ammo, The Fixer will be your best friend. With the right build, even a non-legendary one will be enough to melt most enemies you‚Äôll come across. I‚Äôve also seen players solo both the SBQ and the ISS with a non-legendary Fixer and a few chems.
---
Eventually, the best automatic will most likely be whichever one you own with the best legendary effects. Bloodied and Junkies Fixers are prized possessions, but you can get a Bloodied Combat Rifle for less than 10k caps (depending on the additional effects).
---
A lil late
---
What platform are you on? I'll do it for free since I love building and am pretty bored. Can't really build atom shop stuff but I have almost all the plans so I can do something fun.
---
Yeh, mine was similar today. I change out some of the face scars and it went back to normal.
---
I'd craft it but I think you'd get a ton of grief from other players who assumed you'd cheated your way to level 100.
---
Lol you're not wrong there, but with the one perk, it helps basically bring it to the "normal" amount of resources. Luckily I have a TON of resources saved up so I'm building a fancy building.
---
Xbox
---
I believe the XP buff is guaranteed, but the other ones are random. I‚Äôve yet to see a lunchbox used that didn‚Äôt give the buff. They also stack up to x4 as well.
---
Awesome...can‚Äôt wait for it to cycle back in!
---
Fair enough, but I'm going to continue with my pointless hope :P I really think it'd be better to have a larger test group
---
For example, personally I'm still pretty disappointed in the legendary perks, I said so in OPs thread on bethesda.net, but I'm pretty sure it will just be disregarded because I'm not a PC player
---
I don't know. It just showed up in the crafting menu.
---
After just 200 hours. Man , I must have a problem lol. Believe me, I‚Äôve been there but I always came back. Sad to say I‚Äôm well over 2k hours and still occasionally play. I‚Äôm not into the score grind either. The game is way to easy and I‚Äôve already leveled up 4 characters but I still like it sometimes. All my friends left so if I‚Äôm bored I‚Äôll play for an hour or so just so I don‚Äôt have to watch HGTV with the wife
---
If you've got the beam splitter on the your laser rifle you should remove it... The thing chews through condition super fast. Other than that I rock a laser and plasma on my commando build and manage alright with them.
---
Florida because they don't need to change too much.
---
I spent a day or so farming handmades off the cultists at the lucky hole mine. That's how I got all the mods.
---
I'm PS4, sorry. :[
---
London
---
I'm tier 21 rn, in 6 weeks I could he 100
---
The only locked item in my camp is my ammo machine, everything else is for the public to enjoy.  
---
Sorry for your bad experience, most people aren‚Äôt like this.  Most players I‚Äôve met are more likely to give new players a care package than a hard time.  If you have the gold, buy a turbo fert machine and you can always regen what you take.
---
That's mostly for Atom Shop stuff, can't build things for others unless they have it unlocked too. Some of the endgame gold bullion stuff too.
---
Because they cannot face it's easier and faster to make a new character and lvl up 3 times in it by staying immobile,than posting a useless rant here,where it has no effect.
---
Yeah, wasn't it previously any damage could give you the fusion core charge?
---
On the off chance it would also charge a fusion core in a laser gatling I could see a very small niche use, but even still. PA got the shaft once again.
---
You could simply state that you can't test it directly, but want to provide your feedback. I highly doubt Bethesda would take issue with that.
---
Top left corner of Eastern Regional Penitentiary. 
---
Loaded directly into the building 3 times with a safe just in front of me.
---
Here‚Äôs hoping those lightweight mininukes do the damage of a fat man or more...
---
Yes. It‚Äôs not as powerful as Unarmed, but with the right build and gear, you‚Äôll be one-shotting enemies left and right.
---
If you‚Äôre going full-health, seek out Junkies or Instigating for the most damage. I also highly recommend the Carnivore mutation, as you can stack food buffs to melee damage to attain crazy numbers, even without going Bloodied.
---
You can also utilize 2H weapons in Power Armor.
---
Am I the only one dissapointed in these? Least the previous ones might have been boring but I could find one I wanted (better stealth). Don‚Äôt really care about these. And I‚Äôm not seeing how these are any more interesting.
---
Edit: nevermind. Found the one I want.
---
I say we get like 5 to 10 ppl. 1 person nukes his camp when he server hops the next person joins that server and nukes it again and repeat until he gives up for the day lol. If he's gonna throw that big a fit over some corn let's give the man a cornary!
---
Oh okay
---
Oof
---
So the first recieved will always be the xp buff and then if others are opened it will be something else random? Is that what you mean?
---
If it‚Äôs not locked, it‚Äôs fair to assume the owner did so to allow free access to anyone that passes by.
---
Alaska if only to throw a wrench in things while maintaining the US setting.  Not familiar enough with the deep lore to know if it's off limits.
---
I'd love somewhere close to home, maybe Detroit or Chicago, but your New Orleans idea is way better. Humid, spooky swamps full of radgators waiting to pop out, hostile plant life, Bourbon Street... A lot of potential there.
---
I bet it's a bug. I've been doing the rep grind for what seems like eternity and never once was she not in the basement.
---
North-east and part of canada. Won't happen, but would be interesting.
---
Yeah I'm at like 25 right now so I'm going to be burning through the XP weekend too lol gotta start running Feed the People and stockpile some stew
---
Yes, these are a major improvement. I hope they keep adding more (and more slots) and they definitely need to address the cost issue‚Äîbut a huge step in the right direction.
---
It happened to me too today for the first time, wasn't even logged in. Only thing I got back from support was "we can't adjust ingame score, you're SoL". Surprised they didn't include a direct link to purchase atoms to add insult to injury.
---
This.  The Fixer is queen killer king though for commandos.  The Railway is king for literally everything else.  Beats the lever action hands down.  VATS hardly ever misses in semi auto.
---
If she's not in the basement she could be waiting for you at the Nuka cola plant or VTU if you're on one of those quests.
---
London is gone.....
---
they dont drop from enclave events. but actually from events in the savage divide. like uranium fever, one violent night and guided meditation.
---
apparently they also drop from any the messenger (cant confirm this one though). by the way they are rewarded as a bundle: both masks and the jumpsuits; ehitespring, BOS and white powder jumpsuits all the same time.
---
Thanks for the awesome reply it really goes in depth about each of the barrels. Good thing I looked at this before missing some of my weapons. Though I think even with a long barrel shotguns don‚Äôt need long scopes hahaha.
---
i'm on xbox srry
---
Yes, that‚Äôs been my experience. 
---
This is also corroborated by the [wiki entry](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lunchbox_(Fallout_76)).
---
What is PTS?
---
or is it?
---
That‚Äôs freaking cool. üëçüèªüëçüèª
---
Good luck to ya
---
I love what you‚Äôre doing and, to an extent, I do the same. I‚Äôm a hoarder with legendaries so I tend to hold onto them until I can scrip them. But with mediocre Bloodied, Junkies, and Anti-Armor weapons, I usually sell them for 1000 caps or less, as I know I would‚Äôve loved to find one so cheap when I started out.
---
Lately, I‚Äôve been crafting Fixers of various levels and selling them for cheap. My base is nearby the Wayward, so I get a lot of traffic from new and returning players.
---
Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, because I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve made plenty a player‚Äôs day.
---
Cool. Thank you for clarifying this. I and my unhealthy addiction of cosmetics appreciate it a lot. :¬¨)
---
Cool! How did you go in a circle?
---
*Gasp*
---
New Orleans. So much potential lore. I believe there was previous indication that the Big Easy was being considered for a primary game location as well.
---
I leave my water unlocked and a full corn crop at my camp, you find it its yourse.  Karma is just as important as luck :)
---
When I was a low level I know I had trouble getting supplies some days, fully believe in giveling back.
---
I think about all the Voodo stuff too.
---
The radgators would be wicked!
---
Lol yeah I was afk for a lot of today just waiting for things to sell so I can restock it and I'll just sleep and I saw a lot of heart emotes as I slept soundly in my bed. So many people watching me sleep....you creepy wierdos!
---
You can miss about a week, and that‚Äôs not even including the huge rubber banding that can occur in the double XP and double SCORE weekends. I don‚Äôt know if that alters your outlook. 
---
But I get it. If that‚Äôs not a carrot or if it feels like a 2nd or 3rd job then by all means go recharge or get your entertainment elsewhere. Life‚Äôs short, we‚Äôre all stuck inside, don‚Äôt drain your time in things you don‚Äôt enjoy or don‚Äôt provide any spark.
---
They still drop. I got them both 2 weeks ago along with the Mechanics Outfit, BOS, White Powder and Whitesprings jumpsuits after completing a Guide Meditation event
---
Is it though? I don't pay enough attention to the lore. I have an idea for a London fallout game as well. but if it's gone.. well.

You may have the wrong quest up.  Happened to me too, I realized that one of the Overseer missions points to her house but I need to finish the settler/raiders quests to advance it.  I just toggled it‚Äôs inactive for now.  Also make sure it‚Äôs not the Davenport missions as well

I want to go back to new California. I want to see thriving communities and outposts. With obvious sections of wasteland and city ruins. It'd be great to see how Arroyo turned out decades later.

I read about the lore sometimes and well.....Europe is basically wiped out from what I remember

Ps4 is the same,specially now in summer.

Awesome thanks for the info. I thought it was just random. Good to know when to open them and when to save them for the best benefit
---
EDIT Just read the wiki so EVERY lunchbox gives an  xp bonus plus an additional buff? The wiki says 25% so i assume to get 50% they must stack? If so is it capped?
---
These sound amazing!
---
West side of the map at the train yard. There are a stack of shipping containers. The blue one, I believe, has a Responder Cache in it. There is also a tool box in the main building,  but it often isn't active to use. The Responders one has been usable every time I have checked. Good luck, but if I see you there, I will cut you.
---
No, it should be an upgrade to the camp ‚ÄúArtillery‚Äù plans to make a more ‚Äúfestive‚Äù mass devastation event.
---
It‚Äôs been there since March and still is there
---
They could work similar to fallout 4. Making friendly NPCs spawn.
---
A good way to get stimpacks is fighting bloodbeagles and cultist.
---
I wouldn't know because pacifist mode is on 24/7
---
Or is it?
---
At a minimum there should be two sub modes: solo and groups. I too play solo exclusively, I don't hunt, I hide and try to stealth my way into the final cut. While I don't have a lot of NW time clocked yet so far I've never been killed by another solo player.
---
No, it was always electrical. They haven't touched that one at all since the initial release. If they made it all energy damage, that would be more likely to actually do something but still... Folks with legendary perks are well beyond having fusion core supply issues.
---
I‚Äôll be okay if this is a paid feature 
---
But after lvl50 you can re-assign each point by per lvl
---
How can I have an opinion on how a feature works if I haven‚Äôt tested it?
---
I have over 800 hours in game. I am still not qualified to opine on  mechanics I haven‚Äôt tested.
---
Tens of thousands of players have access to the PTS. Do your jobs and test the new system.
---
Ingram Mansion top floor has a wall safe.  There‚Äôs also a barn with one in it, north of Bolton, and the roof of the bank in Morgantown has one as well.  Few others I‚Äôve hit once or twice but not 100% sure on location.
---
Full auto melts anything too with super low vats cost.  My Junkies explosive does 285 per shot and it is an automatic!!
---
In my earlier years I probably would have been focused on a strict build. Lazy is my game now since I got two kids and a full-time job. Lol.
---
How much faster does the harpoon break?
---
Definitely!  And it‚Äôs even better on a team if everyone opens one of theirs while grouped nearby. Heck, even get as many people not on your team to spread the love!
---
None of my magic heavies work on the queen. They work on the rest tho.
---
My gauss magic gaus shotgunn was totally changed tho.
---
Happened to me too recently. Same situation, make sure not to be on for the daily reset, and also make sure the last mode you played is NOT nuclear winter, those both end up making the challenges autocomplete.
---
Since I‚Äôm restarting for Wastelanders, yes, I use them to soften up the higher level foes I can‚Äôt seem to damage otherwise. (Looking at you, stupid Whitesprings ghouls I had to fight through to get Grants Saber!)
---
But in those other 2 weeks the atoms don‚Äôt return, so that‚Äôs a loss of 12 weeks.
---
I also just went through the whole map, and only saw 1500.  Is there a 500 atom bonus for completing the season?
---
I feel like the world is in one giant PTS server at the moment lol
---
It's not really. We in a roundabout way visited there in fallout 3 operation anchorage dlc. It was a vr basically but still kinda counts. In fact it would be pretty cool to see a way larger presence of the Chinese since they're also a major player in why the world is this way now according to the lore.
---
Just manage your shit better. A tidy and clean house runs better. Tough love x
---
With most people now days going bloodied other builds will fall to pieces
---
Yeah when Ive opened a couple Ive done it at SBQs when everyone is gathered together at the bunker. I feel thats the best place to maximise effect and bonuses since its a high scoring event in its own right
---
Those are all sensible changes. I wish they would have fixed survival instead of adding a 2nd battle royale game they have to maintain.
---
If you like outfits and skins then you would probably like the seasons thing going on. Other than that it‚Äôs the same game just more stuff to grind that isn‚Äôt very exciting end game
---
I would, as building is my favorite part, and I like to build for others more than myself, am PC tho
---
UGH is that todays? Bleh. Looks like today will be my "Double down on the xp grind" Day
---
Hahaha, I‚Äôll keep an eye out
---
I‚Äôd love for it to be in a place where new unique species of creatures would thrive. Like in some tropical wasteland. I‚Äôd love to see mutated apes or wild cats fighting to be the  apex predator. Maybe even mutated aquatic creatures that can only be found in bodies of water. I don‚Äôt know if weapons would still work underwater I‚Äôm not a weapons expert but it would be cool to have super rare loot or maybe have one critical story mission in a body of water. That would be scary and awesome
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. 
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

---
What is wrong with it? This is a legitimate question too, I‚Äôm curious what is wrong with it.
---
If I read it correctly:
---
For example, if you equip legendary strength 1, you'd get 1 extra point in your SPECIAL stats, and one extra point in your Strength category in the perk loadout to equip another strength card or rank up one of your existing ones. A level 4 card would give you 5 points in each for the corresponding category.  The same would apply to any other Special category that you choose to equip a legendary card for.  The max total in any special perk loadout category would still remain 15.
---
If this is accurate, I am foaming at the mouth for some of those cards.
---
Higher levels will give you things if you emote with them sometimes. I know I‚Äôll drop just about anything I have and sometimes I‚Äôll make things for low levels if they emote back. :-) HEART ME DAMMIT.
---
Ooh, anything Enclave or MODUS-related, I‚Äôll happily support. MODUS is...interesting.
---
It took me 40 rolls for a single Uny left arm with super duper on and it wound up being a 1\*. Luck wasn't much better anywhere else either, it took me damn near 100 rolls to get a full Uny set and 2 pieces are 1\*.
---
I agree that some weight reduction/management perks should be spread out a bit more. And it‚Äôs odd that some weapon classes get such a perk and others don‚Äôt. 
---
Personally I think Thru-Hiker makes more sense as an Endurance Perk than Agility. Most of the other food perks are in that category anyways.
---
I‚Äôm speechless, I‚Äôm doing the calculations and if 150% is basically 2.5x and you make 150 .50 with max ammosmith that‚Äôs like 375 without the super duper. This is amazing
---
See earlier comment: radgators in NOLA
---
Choo Choo my brother. My BE90 will never, ever leave my backpack.
---
I think we'd all be a little disappointed if it's not New York City
---
I'm thinking of a "downtown" and a "uptown" from The Pitt DLC. All the skyscrapers are linked together by bridges and scaffolding structures. The rich or ruling class lives in the skys and the poor live in the shadows
---
That‚Äôs actually how I usually have my camp, I prefer the small spaces because it cause me to be more cautious with how I place things and it causes the space to feel more homey in the end.
---
Good on ya friend! Best of luck out there!
---
The animation is a bit off I think
---
I'll totally help ya, if you got a mic I'll makes some filled shelves and displays. Maybe check out my camp for some examples?
---
Are you saying the duplication was small or big, sorry?
---
I'm not sure.
---
Give me a raider one! Or better yet! A ZAX computer one that passively insults you when buying things
---
We don‚Äôt know what happens during those two weeks do we?
---
Yes level 100 gives 500 atoms. Go into the game and look the legendary run map.
---
Choo choo!!!
---
I'll check it out! Thank you!
---
Yha your hand cips thu the mag well
---
I‚Äôm not confused at all. I think everyone already knows about trading perk cards in.
---
TS weapons helps fill it super fast
---
Decreasing the weight of items is just an artificial way to gain carry weight.  You are looking for more carry weight due to higher strength, which already exists in the game.  For each point of strength in your SPECIAL stats, you gain +5 carry weight.  Increase your strength stat, and your carry weight goes up quickly.  There is also weight reduction armor that will lighten the items that you carry in Aid, Ammo, Junk and Weapons.  +20% per piece and it stacks.
---
Here'a a list:

Excellent, thanks

I agree with Thru Hiker belonging in Endurance.

Hahahaha at HGTV, fellow married man here ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Water 200%. Must be that high quality H2O
---
Jesus. I didn‚Äôt even read your entire post because it was so frustrating to read about your experience. As a few seem to have mentioned, the game attracts different people not unlike the real world. I‚Äôll leave the philosophical deep dive to someone more qualified than myself.
---
For reference, I play with a few groups of people, most of whom are decently high level. You can take literally whatever from most players, crops or water, without anyone caring. If a container isn‚Äôt locked or a crop isn‚Äôt purposefully hidden it‚Äôs reasonably fair to assume it‚Äôs up for grabs. And tbh, that stuff is literally abundant all over the map - so to get angry at someone over taking some crops is pretty pathetic.
---
Wishing you and your son more positive experiences as he progresses and interacts with the rest of the community.
---
Or just a quality of life improvement w/o needing a card .. that and cancelling action when pressing another action .. like activating a stimpack
---
Then why are you disagreement ? 
---
waiting to lvl300 to equip all 5 slots is a horrible game design  when the grind is lvling them up
---
I sometimes do this. I was gonna make a post about it but couldn't be bothered. 
---
With up to 3 teammates with 3 camps and possibly up to 3 tents that gives you a lot of options to travel to.
---
The way I read Fire Lining, it protects against fire damage, not explosive damage like fireproof.
---
Shame really I am curious of how it looks on me, but I am leveling up a lot now in NW.
---
Excellent!  Is there a difference in XP?  What is Overseer XP?
---
Just when I thought I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed by you creative camp builders. Great job!
---
Now you're getting it üòÅüëç
---
No, but I've noticed that my damage numbers mean nothing. Sometimes I hit for a lot of damage but the number doesn't change from the last few hits, or vice versa. VATS still seems incredibly inconsistent. Limb damage still has that "magic" effect.
---
I think a while back someone confirmed really hard hitting weapons were just broken and aren't calculating damage properly, hitting for more than they should, but no fix in sight. An actual fix would mean people might be pissed their weapons "suck" when really they're just being brought back to the baseline, but non-legacy energy weapons are still total garbage compared to anything else. We really need a weapon rebalance, for everything.
---
Every 100 levels you gain a "Legendary Token" which means you can pick and choose what legendary effect you want on the weapon you craft. You need to be at least level 300 to craft 1 perfect roll Legendary Weapon that is player bound. You cannot move it to a container or drop it, only from player to stash.
---
Thank you for sharing, I had no idea about the issues.
---
Yeah, adding the legendary special perks is a game changer if they work how it says.  I am pretty excited at the prospect of maxing out some cards that I presently just don't have room for.
---
I figured it out! Put weapons in stash/remove to fix
---
Yes this happened to me, try sever hopping to fix the issue.
---
Does it spawn chicken?
---
If only the legendary module price would be included.
---
Thank you! I tried that and didnt work. It fixed itself after atashing weapons
---
You actually can reload while sprinting.
---
Here's how: Start the reload while walking, Jump mid reload, Start Sprinting in the Air. Run while reloading.
---
Works wonders with Black Powder weapons.
---
Thank you. I've been thinking of building a new PC for myself soon and surprising him with this one so we would be able to play games like this together as I think it would really boost his experience as well. He is a really smart and mature kid, but he is incredibly shy at first. I actually think it would be awesome if he got comfortable and could talk and maybe meet some other kids on Fallout and make friends there to play the game with as well.
---
Cause it freaking blows.
---
If I wanted to play battle royale I could play other games that do it much much better.
---
Plus I hate battle royal.  Why not do team death matches or something.
---
Its so boring to spend all this time just to start a match then die from a cheater and spend another 10 minutes staring at the wall waiting for match to start
---
playerbase*
---
But in the description it says "+X to available perk slots," so what is that to mean other than going past the 15 slot?
---
I‚Äôll try it. I just (finally for my civil war RP) got the dragon and it takes awhile to reload
---
Just look around. I know there's st least 2 safes in Pioneer Scouts Camp so it was easy, did it in 3 games because I enjoy Nuclear Winter.
---
Heathens
---
Glad that worked for ya. Fingers crossed the rest gets fixed, someday maybe. Last topic I saw on here about VATS being broken called it "amusing" so I'm not sure it's even on Bethesda's radar. It's a big problem for VATS users though. :/
---
Because all it does is produce fertiliser?
---
It's gatorade!
---
Civil War you are gonna need a low of BP Pistols, at least 4 when it battles. Do it assassin's creed black flag style. I used to be a Civil War player but its trash against bosses, good against Mobs though.
---
Ya as long as my character don't look like crap I am happy. Maybe check back when the next big thing happens. :( Thank you tho
---
&gt; and not waste durability
---
The repair kits you get from completing the scorched earth quest help with this at least. I'm overflowing with the things. Wish I could drop them for newbies.
---
Ive noticed the "misses" when holding trigger. Ive noticed that pulling the bottom of R2 to decrease trigger pull results in greater accuracy
---
LOL I constantly lock onto fireflies with my bloodied fixer in VATS and see 710, 710,710, 710... and the damn thing is still alive.  Do fireflies seriously have 3k+ HP?  Haha.. those numbers mean diddly.
---
Coast to Coast. New York, with quests that bring you back West into the old locales of Fallout 2. And a DLC bringing you to the ruins of a forward operating base/secret Enclave vault in the Shanghai campaign.
---
I really just want to make it level 45, thats all
---
I thought about a thing like that ! But it would be too op in my opinion, either that, or you make on of your already acquired star, a GOLDEN star, but you have to put again something like 200 level, and that would be perfect
---
I would totally buy stuff that had a fallout 3 type feel (junk walls, dirty stuff, etc)
---
Start at vault 79 edit, 76 and work your way to the nearest quest icons directly south, the two npcs. You should be able to sort it from there.
---
*shudders at the thought of the level 10,000 player
---
Appalachia but 200 years later, near the time of Fallout 4, I need to know how our characters would end
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm mostly solo and just turned level 35. I‚Äôm waiting till at least 50 to even try bosses. I tried the invisible assaultron that thinks it‚Äôs the sheepsquach and got my butt handed to me with one head laser blast.
---
Yeah... I used 4 Fusion Cores for that challenge, hands down the most I've used in a single day in a long time lol.
---
Id do a new playthrough with a different build. There some cool changes with the places you visit as you redo the story.
---
Lmao
---
Only 200 hours? Casual. Don‚Äôt let the door hit you on your way out.
---
Revenant builds are cool though
---
You throw it like a mine. they then shoot a firework in the air.
---
My pleasure dude, I won‚Äôt
---
The way it was explained originally went something like this;
---
You would gain a legendary perk slot at level 50, then every 50th level after, up to a total of 7 legendary perk slots.
---
That was the easy bit, the next part is little bit more complex.
---
Perk coins to level up the legendary perks. 
---
You will be using unused perk cards to exchange for perk coins, at a 1 coin per level of the perk card, level 1 scrapper card = 1 coin, level 3 Batteries included card = 3 coins. You will need 100 coins per legendary perk level. But there is a short cut to jump up the ranks.
---
When you open perk packs, one of them is animated, these are what you need to exchange to earn coins, but it is in your best interests to make sure they are maxed out because each level of an animated card is worth 5 coins, level 1 scrapper animated = 5 coins, level 3 Batteries included = 15 coins. 
---
So, for instance, you would need 6 level 3 animated cards (6√ó15 = 90 coins) and 1 level 2 animated card (10 coins) to make a level 1 legendary perk a level 2.
---
It's going to take a LOT of points to max out a full set of legendary perks, eh?
---
100% agree, although I would love to see more clean things as well (I desperately want the clean shower, toilet, washing machine, and dryer you can find in vault 51) plus more raider items
---
Why do we even map vote?  I've never seen flatwoods win.
---
Cool
---
There's a guy in Fort Defiance now?
---
You aren't thinking Camp McClintock?
---
Good thing I've been saving up scrip since Fasnacht
---
Man the Everglades and keys would be so unreal and terrifying, mutated Estuarian crocs and Gators, manatees and pythons?  The endless cryptids lore, the hordes of charred feral Florida men?  Unthinkable!
---
The Ammo one and the Antivenom one will definitely be my main ones for now, along with Follow Through.
---
My head canon is because its so recent after the war that there are just a lot of newer looking materials around. Especially since this is just a couple decades after the war. But I think a balance between the two would be good for those who really want that Fallout look and feel in their camps. Idk why they don't simply make a dirty and clean version of items so ppl can have either. But tbh I am enjoying nice clean structures. I could never understand why in FO4, everything was still just bundles of tied together garbage, even centuries after the war. 
---
But I also believe they need to raise the budget if they want to keep introducing camp items. It's insanely low and makes you shuffle items way too often if you find something new you like.
---
Wow man IDK where to start.  You have a LOT to do.  Start the wastelanders questline, do both the Raiders and the Settlers up until you are ready to raid the vault and then choose a side.  It really doesn't matter much which side you choose at that point.  Then raid the vault.  After that there are Ally questlines to do.  As soon as you've raided the vault, there are daily quests that award Treasury Notes (Redeemable for gold bullion up to a cap of 200 per day).  You want gold bullion because that is the currency used to buy all of the new plans.  You also have to scrip weapons to earn scrip to exchange for Legendary modules that are required to craft the new weapons.  There is also reputation that has to be gained with each faction in order to unlock access to their best plans for weapons and other stuff.  I cannot stress how important it is enough that you buy as many modules daily as you possibly can.  They are the roadblock you have to overcome to craft a decent version of the new armor and weapons.  You'll waste many because crafting the new weapons will yield many legendary versions that you do not want before you actually get the kind that you do want.  Each RNG legendary craft for a weapon requires two modules, each armor piece requires 1.  You'll probably need 400-500 to get most of what you hope for.  Possibly even more than that.  So at 3-4 a day (which is about what you'll be able to buy daily), you will need to grind modules for a long time.
---
That is the cliff notes version, I'm sure there is much that I have left out.  Good luck.
---
PA perks are still lacking imo. But I do like the new Sprint PA Perk
---
Do I mutate after losing half my health?
---
Store junk, teleport to a public event and wait, somebody will kill you.
---
I'll usually travel to wanted players, shoot them, and wait by the junk to make sure they get it just to help them out.
---
I think you mean vault 76.
---
It does! There are a lot of "mishaps" (idk if its glitches, poor optimisation or what) that we never had to deal w in F4. However, this interface is F I R E 
---
F4's is HOT GARBAGE lmao
---
Overseer XP is the base system of rank awards ([overseer rank ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank).
---
For the Halloween/Christmas rewards they work in the way that the post aforementioned explains (700xp gets the Halloween armor paints, etc)
---
The Christmas rewards unlock weirdly though, I unlocked all the Halloween awards yet I‚Äôm still playing to unlock the final Christmas reward of the coat with the beanie (have the beanie). It supposedly is locked a little differently as it‚Äôs a bug.
---
Just grind it out and you‚Äôll get some fun stuff as well as the NW rewards (included in that clicky)
---
Happy hunting in the wasteland!
---
No shit? I suppose that makes sense. Hopefully we will, and for free! üòí
---
A great new benefit from the new update.
---
its not really there.. likely goo'd by another player and waiting to respawn
---
The drawback to this strategy is that you'd end up with the new legendary weapons and armor on a toon that can't do much with them.
---
This is the one. I'll add that it's really hard to make a good build before level 50 because of the way perks are level-gated, so be patient and expect to be level 50-80+ before you really become your best self.

Get convenience perks to get you to your endgame build, you can change perks anytime. Get the charisma "inspirational" perk to rank 3 because you should always be on a team and it's a big xp boost, swap it with rank 3 "hard bargain" whenever you are buying/selling to get a few more caps. In luck and perception there are early perks that increase the loot you find, pharma farma, can do,  scrounger, butcher's bounty, and especially green thumb to name a few, and they will pay for themselves,  but you don't need them equipped all the time. Levelling up before level 50 raises both an attribute point AND gives a perk choice, BUT they don't need to be in the same attribute.
---
A little self care goes a long way. Sleep regularly for the well rested bonus for some extra %xp. Play musical instruments to be "well tuned". Eat and drink enough, especially if you have the endurance skill "rejuvenated" - razorgrain soup is very easy to make and restores health, so it is usually my main way of healing through the early game. If you are finding anything challenging, see if drugs will help!
---
This is the kind of stuff I'm looking for, thank you so much! Very helpful!
---
The amount our consoles will sound like airplanes will be immense.
---
You're definitely the first person to think of this in the two years the game has been out.
---
Equip the travel perk!
---
In Morgantown, Mama Dolce's has one inside in the office on the ground floor in the corner.
---
EDIT: I'm finding that completing Nuclear Winter challenges counts towards the weekly "do 3 daily NW challenges", even if they aren't actually dailies. Can anyone confirm?
---
I don‚Äôt get it. People make all these amazing things yet my crappy little CAMP always hits budget
---
Time for legendary modules
---
I wouldnt hold your breath.. I mean its not completely unheard of.. but its as rare as a natural god roll drop...
---
Don‚Äôt remind us about that terrible nightmare fuel pleas
---
I don't buy collectrons or vendor skins usually. Never seems worth the money, more annoying than anything else. Already have to deal with daguerre's constant whining about headaches, thats enough for me.
---
Would be OP, but fun, with some cooldown could be viable
---
How could you say that? They're helping PA-players great deal with this one!
---
Near-dead bloodied Riflemen will be distracting the actual end-game bosses (Mirlurk kings) by laughing at their zero-damage poison attacks, so that Heavy Gunners could take advantage of this juicy sprinting perk to run away and do something else with their time, grind fusion cores for example.
---
Great, isn't it?
---
Honestly? Because low level gear is easy enough to repair. 
---
And when your high level, repair material is plentiful enough. Hell, repair kits are ridiculously easy to stock up on with Scorched Earth.
---
It's a cool immersive idea, and I wouldn't mind seeing it. But, I can't see too many people using it.
---
Np.
---
I had a couple hundred or so I know were legit b/c I looted and/or bought the wrapping paper, or my santatron provided.  
---
Talked to a couple other players that each  had 1000 known duped.  I know those same players were actively playing during the event, but I don‚Äôt know how many ‚Äúreal‚Äù presents they got at the time)
---
After that, its just a matter of scale.  IIRC, Didn‚Äôt BGS released figures on how many wrapping papers were purchased/legendaries killed?    We can only speculate on how many duped presents there are.
---
but based on my 3 person (statistically insignificant, I know), sample, its about 200 legit, 2000 duped.  If I did the math right, then 
---
10% legit, 90% duped.
---
I can't find a consistent way to use the gauss pistol at all. Charge before VATS, charge after, it still misses more 95% shots than I hit, and because of the low damage when not charged I'm nearly useless with it. Had a great roll on mine but leaving pistols behind for the second time.
---
If you haven't already - add the prison courtyard to your lead rotation. In the middleish area near the back entrance; there are weights on the ground which scrap for a lot of lead. Theres also a nearby bench in the shed you can use to scrap them quickly so they dont weight you down.
---
This is the main reason I like seasons so much, we earn things just by playing. Sure, Captain Cosmos, Ghilly &amp; Atomic Onslaught aren't for everyone but they are dope and free. This is only the first round, itll improve later on for sure. 
---
However I do think we should be given more free items to work for, at a reasonable amount of work. It could definitely fill that void of no content. 
---
"Help x w x problems = get item" 
---
Or they should update packs &amp; give the items retroactively:
---
The log cabin pack should have a log cabin build kit
---
The contemporary pack needs matching roofs and second story porches
---
EVERY SET NEEDS MATCHING ROOFS.
---
I've done far more than 70, done it 6 times today alone, &amp; that's about average for me each day.
---
Yea I thought about getting the train car. Looks like something that would blend in where I have my camp since it‚Äôs down the road from the trainyard.
---
If you don't want to comment you don't have to.
---
Do you have the perk card equipped?
---
It is not, it is awful for low health builds, and for full health builds the option of Auto-Stim Armor still exists.
---
There were people walking around with 15k lol
---
Once you join in a group, do you talk to your teammates or do you have to enable something to make that happen?
---
I, so badly, want to have a black powder build. I want to run around the wasteland in my union, or revolutionary general uniform and blast everything with my BPR, BPP, and swing my revolutionary sword. Every time I feel inspired to do so, though, I get bombarded by a swarm that constantly interrupts my reload, slowly killing me. The only option is to turn, run, and switch to another weapon. Makes me sad... and angry.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of grinding but the T-65 and that gun metal grey Camo looks cool.
---
I play FO76.  Obviously I don't have a girlfriend.
---
It wasnt even post season 1, it was yesterday lmao
---
Also apologies on the lag! Still figuring this app out
---
That happens to me at the end of my session with all the broken perks that helps with my dmg output. That and VATs not working like I think it should. 
---
Oh well. lol

---
Makes too much sense and requires more man hours...
---
Do you have unlimited amount?
---
I'm hoping for the Clandestine paints to come out. I usually in games customize my stuff in Spec-Ops black, dark grey
---
But the ghillie camo for the SS set, and Atomic paint for T65 will have to do
---
I was at the Whitespring for a long time myself with my first camp.  Moved to the Mire personally for the dark nights.  
---

---
He lost most people at welcome lol
---
No you get it from the Legendary Run
---
I will always "Follow Me" to fresh events or high enemies.
---
This new list looks awesome! Obviously infiltrator!!! But legendary ability looks really nice. These are things I can definitely get excited about!
---
Looks great. I might check that location out.
---
A small argument could be made that while humans are not taking care of things, there are quite a few robots around...
---
Ahh okay.
---
It's a bug that showed up around Wastelanders.  
---
It's not guaranteed (I haven't seen it since SCORE went live) but when it does happen, it's pretty handy if you have explosives or basically anything that can fill a small area with a lot of damage.  
---
Also makes collecting a lot easier.
---
I am not sure but I think it still area chat.  This isn't even me grp'd with people.  I just go to random people in the world and ask if they have any lunchboxes and if they want to match them against mine to increase the benefits.  Even if they can only hear me they reply with emotes and them opening the first box is the glowing seal of approval, lol.
---
They hate power armor, they hate energy weapons, they think everyone should be a Stealth sniper/command or bloodied melee.
---
Sounds like a good plan.
---
Doorways. You can place two doorways against each other then change them to walls. Been doing this for a while.
---
 it's ok I get it you love me and agree with me I too love you my dearest brother, and I will always take care of you :)
---
Don't forget the Raiders' and Settlers' own unique plans from Mortimer and Samuel respectively. The chemist backpack mod is so handy!
---
Depends on how much you play. And how much of that time you spend dicking around sorting your stash box.
---
I am spending the next few weeks putting as much as possible in the scrapbox before i cancel it (you can still take stuff out but not put stuff in)
---
I have about 60k steel and 10k lead and loads of other stuff in there. I'm gonna be sorted for 2mm EC for the next few years. I'm doing trades for flux instead of caps so that goes in there.
---
It's not random, you just have to put your survival tent in the correct spot to force it.
---
I mean, I pay for it. The tent you can put anywhere on the map and travel back to it for free, along with it having amenities like a bed, an instrument, a STASH box, and usually a cooking bench, plus unlimited scrap space in the ScrapBox, plus the free emotes, Veteran Ranger gear, AND the ability to have a private world where all progress transfers to regular adventure mode?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs worth it to me. Rightttt up until you realize that I have to pay for two subscriptions since I play with my wife exclusively
---
It never occurred to me that I was getting credit for 2 each hit because I was using a two-shot weapon ü§¶
---
You smoke 8 packs before scrapping.
---
Erectus quit soooooo lol and the funny thing is other coders are trying to make his program work even tho it's missing 3/4 of the tools, Update 20 is a godsend and hope Bethesda keeps up with these amazing anti script kiddie hacks.
---
There's some videos on YouTube but basically if you put a survival tent in a certain spot it messes with the spawns and forces them to spawn directly on the generator. Pretty great XP.
---
Really? Now that's interesting. I hadn't noticed that.
---
I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for the next time it happens.
---
qq
---
If you like and use the bonuses and play every day yes.
---
If not then simply no. Everyone who has it is going to tell you yes. Those that don't will say no.
---
Yeah that's the first thing I made sure of. Been spawning in at the train yard, the one toolbox in the main building is always Inaccessable, and by time I try getting to anywhere else I get killed. So it's taking forever on this one.
---
Just go to Morgantown trainyard. At least 3 there in the responder caches.
---
Not only does every function he had in the menu before he quit working in the latest build, weve actually added features to it and have cleaned up the code significantly to make it easier for future builds.
---
Oh, damn. I didn't realize the chems they spawned were actually *new*! That's really neat!
---
I only play it for limited time rewards if I want them. If I leave fill on then I go into the safe zone and build a bunch of rooms. I used to do one room and had the rest of my team build a small fort around my room. It was great. I did feel kind of bad for doing it but usually randoms I have don't play as a team anyways.
---
I plopped down next to the church since it plays music every night and a lot of people don't know that outside the reddit.  Really helps with the atmosphere of the camp while also sharing a neat bit of the world with randoms.
---

---
If you have 1st you may have to adjust the tent slightly. So if the first lot appear normally run out and move if more towards the hole in the wall.
---
Did one tonight and after scrapping everything i had 3969 steel (i did use a guns and ammo 5 which increases scrap). That's a nice haul. SO MUCH XP!
---
I could see it happening, but you would only be able to see your pictures.
---
The pissed off guy was wrong, I'm not defending him, but with the game rating (that I know no one follows) mixed with it being an online game, I personally wouldn't think someone that young would be playing.
---
I'll start with that I hate NW just like a lot of people, I bought this game for the fallout experience, not the fortnite experience. That being said, I still do the challenges and found out that I am a bush wookie god, (constatly being in the last 3-5 people every match) so it doesn't bother me as much anymore. I would never play the mode as intended though because Battle Royale is trash. Thats just my 2 cents.
---
*Update 21 has entered the chat*
---
How old is OPs kid anyway? I started playing video games when I was 12 lol
---
It is important, but the most basic prob is we need more CAMP BUDGET. You cant decorate your camp well without this.
---
I run 3 guns with commando to stretch my ammo. Each one is an instigating explosive. 
---
Handmade for 5.56
---
Fixer for .45
---
Combat Rifle with a .38 receiver
---
You want broken legendary perks?  Bethesda is on that like white on rice!
---
Go the monthly route if you are on the fence. One month is not that bad price wise. Slightly more than if you bought Atoms.
---
And we will be ready for it
---
I enjoyed it as well up until yesterday where bethesda just decided to yeet 4k of my score right out the window.
---
I've seen a couple at Glassed Cavern.
---
The legendary popup sound, when i'm doing some heavy transfer i just remove my helmet before emptying the container with all legendary scrap and it's cause a lot of lags and it's gonna display everything you pick up just to be sure you don't miss anything...
---
Once wookied a match down to the final 12 players. A guy came up and stood right next to my bush and I thought "why not I'll get a kill too". Pulled out the grenade launcher I found along the way and shot my shot... That ONLY killed me. that familiar death music blared as I fell to my knees and forward out of the bush. Was one of the funniest moments and probably one of the most "wtf?" For them.
---
I get to see a lot of cool camps on Xbox, but I go out of my way to check them out as I run across the map. I‚Äôm always checking my compass for the little tent icon. The niftiest ones I‚Äôve seen were either before vendors came out or are users without them hooked up, so I don‚Äôt really expect to find really creative ones when fast traveling to vendors. Some of the more creative ones I‚Äôve come across have been trap camps, which is why I don‚Äôt bemoan them in general, to be honest. A well crafted (not suspicious at all) trap that doesn‚Äôt target newbies with some entertaining or quirky element deserves kudos and can be a nice bit of fun to stumble upon :)
---
Team Deathmatch is something I could definitely get behind. I don't want this one life trash. Thats why I am a bush wookie forever, see you in the final 5 lol.
---
The OP doesn't say, but when the OP talks like he hasn't played a lot of games, mixed with him being upset from someone yelling at him, I'm assuming we're talking less than 10. Any teenager, at least mine and her friends, would have no problem cussing back and chewing the guy out. If nothing else, wouldn't describe the guy for "using words he couldn't say".
---
Not everyone works on bug fixes.  If they *only* worked on bug fixes half the team would have nothing to do.
---
And Bethesda is gonna do what Bethesda wants to do anyway.  There is no harm in people making suggestions to make conversation on an online form.  It's not like someone makes a suggestion and they like "That's genius!  Guys stop fixing bugs and start working on this random Reddit user's idea!"
---
You are a sad, strange, little man, and you have my pity. Farewell.
---
On xbox during fastnaught I saw a level 12500. No joke. Was terrifying to think how much they either played or cheated .
---
Or a miliciens squad with Preston at his head !
---
&gt; I thought looking at the new diner set in the Atom Shop that dropped for example looked really clean, too, until I implemented it in my C.A.M.P
---
I got nailed on that too.  The floors are...worn but acceptable.  The wallpaper looks downright dingy though.  Little bummed out because it goes so well color scheme-wise.  I've got it up for now and I think it's growing on me, but if something cleaner pops up....
---
So does wearing matching armor boost poison and fire resist simultaneously?
---
Just spawn yourself at Morgantown train yard and there‚Äôs a white watchtower building with a yellow crate in it, you can just pick the lock while you‚Äôre still invisible then quit. Rinse and repeat. There‚Äôs a post from earlier today where they give the exact location to spawn and what the building looks like, it took me about 15 minutes to do and was super easy(including loading times of games)
---
explode?
---
Ok. Can‚Äôt say that I agree but I understand where you‚Äôre coming from.
---
Honestly I dont care who uses these hacks, just please keep it out of NW cause it ruins the experience for players trying to play legit.
---
What's a toon?
---
To rank them up you have to use your perk cards on your character to, when they are ranked up they are locked to that character from what I understand.
---
So, in my case, I have 5 level 200+ characters, where, if I‚Äôm lucky I could pick maybe one card to max rank out on each of them, where, if it was account wide I could get 2-3 max ranks.....
---
Better than they WERE, but not all what I'd like.
---
.
---
Do they take suggestions? Because I will freely offer up suggestions. Normally I get *paid* for developing games, but I'll brainjam all day and not sweat it.
---
There is a second one in a taller tower directly NW of that spot as well.  Connected to the building.   Then a third in a tent just NE of the train station.
---
Which regular perks are broken?
---
Like I said in my original post, its been specifically designed to refuse to work in Nuclear Winter.
---
Yep, last mode I played last night at 3am was NW...
---
I'm in the same area and I have been doing NW too.
---
Holy paragraph :o
---
Ive since learned that the xp required for xmas exclusives unlock is calculated differently than the halloween stuff. The xp needed for each halloween unlock doesnt reset after each whereas the xmas ones do. So you need a lot more xp to unlock the winter outfit and beanie etc
---
It‚Äôs definitely worth it just for the scrap box, pay 99 bucks and don‚Äôt worry about it for the next year
---
To be honest, I don't think it is just the game. I've been seeing more and more toxic people in the community both in and outside the game. I think it is just the trend of people in the world nowadays. Everyone is just out for themselves and they don't care what they destroy in order to get what they want.
---
Agree with you OP. Spent over an hour now and got one lock picked. Keep getting killed within the first 15 seconds trying to get a lock. Then I get a wonderful 12 exp for it and have to wait another 5 mins to try again. Worthless game mode and only here to try and stay ahead in this season. Ill be skipping every NW from here because its not worth the effort.
---
You really need to space out some paragraphs since most people are not going to bother reading that wall.  Also there are a few outdated and fundamentally wrong remarks you made in your accounts.  On top of all that is the sheer fact that regardless of your experiences this game has an actual amazing community as a whole.  Even the hackers were helping people who lost items to various glitches back in the day.
---
edit - double wording
---
Haha sorry man I just needed to get this off my chest to the community. Hopefully getting the word out will help get something done with griefers.
---
Power armor breaks really slowly you should be fine to take it off.
---
Thank you have my upvote
---
Yeah he‚Äôs in the room on the right as soon as you walk inside.
---
Yes! I love that there's more ground to cover for less caps. And, sometimes your team mates are really awesome
---
www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hmtiww/list_of_currently_broken_perks
---
I got it for the scrapbox, the survival tent and the ability to play on a solo server when I‚Äôm scrounging for supplies.
---
I‚Äôve never enjoyed it so much as today when I (currently Level 16) ventured over the mountains to the Whitespring and the ghouls were no higher than level 25.
---
Having been there on previous characters at a similar level, I used to get slaughtered frequently. Now I can get supplies and level up without worrying as much.
---
Def god mode cheat.  2000s is where the highest legitimate players are around.
---
I fully expected Bethesda to marginally improve the perks. Thank Todd they are able to listen. My current plan is:
---
* Master Infiltrator
---
* Ammo Factory
---
* What Rads
---
* 3x Legendary Ability
---
I may decide that Ammo Factory and/or What Rads are too situational and go for up 2 extra LAs...

I actually hate this interface, you have to scroll through the whole fucking thing just to find the one thing you want, while in fo4 they‚Äôre micro-categorized enough that it‚Äôll only take like one or two clicks to reach the section you want.
---
So i did read the whole thing.  Thats definitely shitty that happened but i find i encounter exponentially more nice people than griefers.  Also while there is an active leveling exploit, just because a player is high level does not mean they exploited.  There is a twitch streamer named Alrex whos level 2000+ completely legit for example
---
I guess it depends on what price you personally put on virtual goods. The atoms per month plus the ranger outfit (if it's a permanent unlock) seem to be worth it if you constantly find yourself wanting to unlock stuff in the atom shop. 
---
Do you get the atoms for the first month you subscribe? If so then it's probably a solid investment per month at 12.99 than just buying the atoms outright.
---
Holy crap. Damn, how do people figure these things out...?
---
Let me guess, you're on XBox? I'm on PC and keep reading all these good Samaritan stories, and yet I'm level 78 and have only ran into trolls and griefers. I even tried to help a low-level guy and the first thing he screamed at me was "please don't kill me", when I came up on him. 
---
Not trying to sound like I'm complaining, just curious what platform you're on because PC seems like a cesspool.
---
Ook these are way better then the last ones
---
Marsupial
---
it's definitely a convenience, for all those reasons others have listed...but it is only your time invested and your wallet that can make the decision.
---
it's simple to subscribe one month, then unsubscribe the next. why not give it a go?
---
Dam your toxic
---
Damm, so how much actually do I need? I already got the beanie. And am leveling up, typically winning 1/5 of my games and the 4/5 I'm top 10, 3/5 top 5
---
HA. Glad you had fun. It's always nice when people don't melt the queen. 
---
The flux from the nuked plants has to be stabilized and you do this by combining the raw flux with a few other ingredients.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flux](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flux) Certain things can be crafted with that stable flux. Different plants give different types of flux. Some is easier to get.
---
Word of warning though. If you take too long to do something with it it becomes inert and can weigh quite a bit if you have loads.
---
Because it is capped at 15. and I have 13 agility. I could stick a level 2 Legendary Agility to bring it to 15. However once I was able to upgrade the Legendary Agility further. I could remove 3 from agility to somewhere else and stick the level 4 Legendary Agility card in.
---
For a deathclaw you need wasteland whisperer perk not animal friend.
---
ty, does it have to be lvl 3?
---
Not sure but I believe so. I just tamed one for the first time before I logged off tonight.
---
Yep. Fun fight.
---
did you do it at deathclaw island?
---
Yes, took over an artillery turret I was standing next to and beat me like no tommorrow. Freaky little bastard.
---
Couple times out in the Bog, but since Wastelanders the stupid thing spawns directly at my camp every other night I play. Such useless drops for a rare creature spawn too.
---
Not sure of your level but it has to be lower than you. I recommend Deathclaw island for a low level spawn.
---
Don't get me wrong, I think it will be useful for those who casually play the game. 
---
If you were level 50, and only playing an hour or two every few days, the stuff I list won't really apply.
---
Like I said, it's a cool idea that can be useful to some. I just don't think many would actively use the feature unless it had more to it (maybe a minor buff to your degradation speed if you use the vendor to repair your gear).
---
Yes, I really wish we could put the star wallpaper on the ceiling.
---
It does have an amazing player base for the most part. But as I was saying that the people who are doing these things are driving people away from the game.
---
If you craft a lot and can‚Äôt leave a location without stripping every bucket, clipboard, and burned textbook to scrap for components, then the scrap box and tent are a total game changer. More so if you ever claim public workshops or run headfirst into fights without checking you are prepared, so you never have to worry about dropping the piles of junk weighing you down. If you like cosmetics, the extra atoms are also nice for that.
---
I used to carry so much on me that I couldn‚Äôt pick up loose caps because I was so overencumbered. The Junk Shield perk card was actually useful to me at the time and I simply was used to not ever being able to move quickly - forget sprinting or fast traveling. Scrap box changed the whole game for me. Now I only weigh myself down with weapons and armor I craft or hoard to drop for newer players; I don‚Äôt really even stockpile ammo like I used to, since I almost always have all I need to craft batches of it. If the tent had a means of crafting other than food, I‚Äôd consider it a paid-for advantage to gameplay rather than convenience, since it would be a bit too much of a benefit.
---
A bow/crossbow with fire arrows works well here.
---
Yep super easy fight with disappointing rewards.
---
Many times on the cliffs outside Watoga.
---
Is it really that bad? I haven't heard it yet.
---
Ah ok. Do you spend perk points to get the original level 1 perk cards to fill the empty slot?
---
I successfully pacified it but how do it tame it?
---
pioneer scout camp has 2 safes
---
My favorite memory involving it was coming across one chasing a mid level player in the Mire in the dead of night.
---
Says the guy that is intentionally acting facetious and defending a breach of an agreement. 
---
Your biased, and it shows. And I abhor those with such blatant bias regardless of which side of an issue they take. 
---
That mindset is a festering and entitled one. 
---
*I get to break the rules because someone else did!*. That‚Äôs the logic of a toddler. 
---
Grow up.
---
I don‚Äôt tolerate the attitudes of Karens and Kyles.
---
What‚Äôs the point of AFKing? Won‚Äôt you get little to no exp because you didn‚Äôt  do anything?
---
Ok but first they need to fix the bugs in fallout 3
---
Played since the beta and I‚Äôve still never seen it
---
Walking Arsenal from NW in Adventure mode would be god tier.  90% weight reduction on all weapons? yes please
---
This happened to me after encryptid, I feel your pain
---
Thanks.
---
spawn blocking has been in the game since day dot. The game likes to spawn enemies out of sight. That's why they usually come running out from behind the walls.So if you knew where things spawned you could force them to spawn somewhere else. But for some reason on this one if you block a spawn point and the gods are favouring you they land right in the middle and it's a slaughter.
---
I found a great weapon for this as well. An Instigating auto grenade launcher with 90% reduced weight. because i'm not a massive clownshoe i fire once which is enough to tag nearly all of them and then let everyone else get their hits in and finish them off.
---
Ran into one yesterday at the glade next to generals steak house, very nice place visually to fight it.  It even gave me a toy car.... makes me wonder what this üëΩ was after....
---
Wow that‚Äôs crazy I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to get that high of level. It just seemed odd to to me that someone who spent that much time in the game felt the need to act that way lol. But I agree for the most part the players I meet are friendly. I‚Äôve just noticed a pretty significant increase of griefers lately.
---
Miami or Tampa
---
*gasp again*
---
What this guy said, so many people doing the same thing and since I apparently have a slightly worse internet connection or something, I spawn in a bit later and someone beats me to it or shoots me as I'm unlocking the one I spawn right by.  It took me far too many rounds to get 3.  I went 5 rounds with only getting 1 when I made this post.  Got 2 more finally after another 3 rounds.
---
At the least if we didn't all have the same dang daily where we're all doing the same thing it'd help
---
I did once after 300 hours but I was share playing on my buddy‚Äôs account to help make his camp and it walked up to me....so in a manner yes but on my account no... still need to complete challenge üò°
---
If you do Queen of the Hunt there's a chance you'll find it as there's a guaranteed cryptid. 
---
or if you have raider punk he can send you on a quest to kill it
---
Good strategy.
---
i dont rightly know but its a lot. Basically you need to earn 14000 further xp from whenever you unlock(ed) the beanie. Im not sure how much you need for the beanie and whatever comes before that. Im pretty certain Ill never see either. I suck too much to get that far lol
---
get the shadowed mod if you can for leather armor, it's magic. with 5 shadowed pieces you can lurk with ease.
---
Any of your 5 available characters per account.
---
I'm saying do it on your main where the new weapons and armor can be utilized to their potential, not a low level character.
---
I found two in the bog about 2 weeks ago. One teleported away and the other engaged me. 
---
My first time ever seeing them. The way they glow in the night was pretty cool.
---
The vanishing ones, especially.
---
Australia, San Diego, Tiger King Zoo.
---
I just want to see more unique experiments on animals running around in the world.
---
Carol Baskins endgame boss.
---
I agree with this. Put all of those pop-ups down in the lower right corner instead of where they dominate the screen.
---
I honestly don't know that, sorry.
---
I have assumed that you get a choice of legendary perks each 50 levels
---
But it looks like each legendary perk starts with level 0 but already has a small effect even at level 0.
---
Are you on XBox? If so, what are you selling your fixer plan for? Been trying for one forever.
---
Legendary ability will probably be used by bloodies
---
That's "intended" too. I like it that there's random stuff to do that might not be the pure battle royale.
---
Yes there is, I know there is but I‚Äôm not the best at explaining things so I couldn‚Äôt tell you how
---
Sometimes i wish it would just scrap, or ask if i want it scraped, all the things it just packed up when moving C.A.M.P.s.
---
I mean, as much as I want PA to make me a god, it has to have *some* balance over armor besides just not being able to craft or swim.
---
Ab inability to use poison/fire resist legendary perks would probably be one; though logically the least sensical.
---
Though if they're not letting power armor use this one; are they nerfing the normal perk that halves fire+explosion damage aswell to be consistent?
---
You cant tame the one at Deathclaw Island because its a static spawn. Tamable animals cant be at a set spawn and must be alone
---
Thanks for the help either way dude
---
&gt;the game pass
---
Oh granddad
---
&gt;:(
---
Hit R and you can transfer selectively on most containers/corpses.
---
wow. this.is.amazing.
---
Your right I am biased bethsda screwed alot of people out of alot of money. I have zero respect for them, if somone hurts thier bottom line I am ok with that. The same way a murder deserves to be sent to prison they deserve  to be punished by thier player base.
---
No with the amount of content they're giving us and the amount of neglect they give the player base, why feed them money.
---
I can see your point. They categorized it more towards the type of structure rather than the actual item it was. It was easier if you were building one type like concrete or warehouse.
---
I get in a game long enough to lockpick and then either the game crashes or the game disconnects.
---
Apparently the vendor at harpers ferry, phoenix BoS in watoga and sutton station. 
---
but some people say it's only a drop from capturing and defending/retaking workshops.
---
They have fixed spawns. It's not hard to remember one and spawn there 3 times.
---
I accidentaly won a match yesterday while looking for the 3rd lock
---
By increasing +1 to a SPECIAL can I add more basic cards to my build?
---
The barn to the North Northeast of Bolton Greens has a toolbox inside that‚Äôs always locked
---
Yup I'm at 28 unused points and 4 unopened perk packs so far I literally stop caring about levs till the new season started and I went from 99 to 150 since it started
---
Outside Abby's bunker.
---
A lot of people on YouTube seem to use tricks like using rugs for roofs and skipping defensive stuff because it quickly eats up the budget. I love that white picket fence though.
---
It would also be awesome if they had an NPC as a vendor for the camp. That way you can make camps with multiple buildings so it looks like a small town.
---
You can place your camp to overlap some of the train towers.
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll check those places if they‚Äôre not there than I‚Äôll have to try to get it by claiming workshops
---
High ping and I spawn in late, die, then have to wait again just to do it over.
---
It can be bought from other folks. But I will say to keep going. Yesterday I got 2 different paint plans. That‚Äôs so unusual. I‚Äôm wondering if they didn‚Äôt secretly change the spawn rates
---
I noticed at Uranium fever last night I didnt get to loot the 2 legendaries I definitely got a shot on. One had vanished too so it could well be more fuckery afoot. Its a bit of a shame because there for a while I was getting more legendaries than I knew what to do with just from doing the usual things Id do. It seemed like there were more appearing in the wild and at events than Id usually see and often 3 stars were bobbing up more than usual too.
---
Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your side of the issue), this will ultimately be used to display porn. On PC, you can change the picture files (of the photos) with other PNG images.
---
Also, even if bethesda decided to encrypt the photo files or make it inaccessible, the photos can still be used for porn. Also on PC, there exists a nude mod. So people can just take pictures using the nude mods and then display them in camp.
---
15, if i remember correctly
---
I‚Äôve got an extra. What‚Äôs your PSN?
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
(Thats a F:NV reference, for those that dont get or remember it)
---
UZIVIPER11 how many caps would you take for it?
---
New Orleans or Chicago.  Either one could be great.  The swamps around NO could be a fun environment.  Riverboats, Downtown, lots of lore.  Legendary monsters could spawn at the Myrtles if the map was big enough.
---
It'd help if our allies wouldn't repeat the same lines over and over. I built a jail cell for mine, it worked for a while till the game allowed her to teleport through the wall.(smh)
---
Its got electrolytes
---
Yet to be determined
---
Now begins the journey of a million more queens killed.
---
It‚Äôs free. I‚Äôll add you.
---
oh god. i wish i could unsee that.
---
If you use a shotgun 4 leaf clover every day, no need for critical savvy. Rifleman or commando Critical Savvy combined with 4 leaf is a hugely diminishing return. With critical savvy at 3 every 2nd hit will fill the  critical meter, with 4 leaf clover maxed the chance that it will trigger on the second shot is the same as on the first shot. That's a lot of points for something you will never take full advantage of. Grim Reaper would be a better choice as your AP will be constantly filling up and VATS will always be available.
---
Thank you I needed this for my camp I‚Äôm building right now
---
Theres a safe and a toolbox in mama Lucia's to unlock
---
Prison, charleston fire dept, lucky hole (though I haven't been back there since wastelanders, idk if it changed) and monorail elevator are my go to's.  Shockingly I usually run out of steel before funpowder or lead
---
You are correct. I just realized that there was a difference between pacify and taming.
---
Headless Horseless Man
---
I‚Äôll come to your camp
---
I saw my first one here as well.
---
I‚Äôll be a minute I‚Äôm afk right now
---
Well there's no rifle which is ridiculous. 
---
I would have said the SS armour but you're gonna go with the stealth suit. Maybe go for the ammo maker. It doesn't make huge amounts but it adds up. I have mine making 5.56 even though i don't use it. Every now and then i pop back to camp and collect it as it only makes 200 5.56 at a time.
---
"You can never have enough Gold!
---
Stop by next week so I can disappoint you again."
---
-Smiley
---
If I were you I would go for the ss armour but to get all the pieces it‚Äôs a bit of a grind
---
I never bothered with allies.  Didn't see the appeal.
---
retaking is easier and quicker than defending FYI
---
If I lock it, it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want you to have it. I‚Äôll even enclose crop foundations in a locked area if I really don‚Äôt want people taking them because I want them for something in particular.
---
It‚Äôs is unlocked or easily accessible, grab away.
---
Then the players can choose to stop spending money on the game and move on and spend money elsewhere. 
---
Breaking an agreement weakens the validity of their position. 
---
Legal and peaceful protests are one thing. Vandalism and rioting and violence are another. 
---
And one more time (and you already agreed with this): **Two Wrongs Do NOT Make A Right.**
---
You want to gain support for your position against Bethesda?  Then be ABOVE REPROACH.  
---
Sinking down to ‚Äòtheir level‚Äô and willfully violating ToS means you lose the high ground. 
---
It‚Äôs an entitled attitude to decide that you have any right to break your end of the agreement. And frankly, it‚Äôs disgusting. 
---
Maybe you‚Äôre okay with eroding your integrity. 
---
***I‚Äôm not.***. And I think anyone willing to do so is pathetic. 
---
Twice. 
---
First time it disappeared in a flash. 
---
Second time I think I one shot it and got no rewards of note.
---
Awsome thank you
---
We restarted PS4s and we have both tried appearing online and playing.
---
I think I may need to just get a middle man so we can join each other.
---
Good luck!  Camp is looking nice.
---
there will be more mods for SS armor to get in patch 21
---
*this comment was brought to you by deep pocketed gang*
---
It is overpriced, but it makes the game playable
---
Only ever found one. I could see pink bitches in the distance, but couldn‚Äôt find them, then after a perilous search, realised he‚Äôd glitched and was invisible 30ft in the air. Nothing would work or interact with this space they were meant to occupy, the only thing that worked *was a melee bash with my camera if you can believe it*
---
I did once but he teleported away as soon as I approached him.
---
My question: are these new chens tradable? And can they stay on you character if you switch perks?
---
Def not the right place to ask as you don‚Äôt know if someone will be a dick or not. 
---
There are a lot of mental health subs on reddit, but they are more issue specific
---
Edit: as someone going through the same things most likely in the same age range, I can talk if you‚Äôd like
---
Yeah, I understand but how on earth are we capable of crafting high tech weapons but we wont be able to build 'flashy' new stuff. We can make ultacite fusion cores but we are incapable of painting a damn wall? 
---
Like I said, I also prefer the old shack look. I dont use atom shop fancies.
---
You didn't want to do more quests?
---
for flamer fuel I just make flamers. They come with 100 by default I think
---
Not the right place but im willing to talk to you about your problems :) or just listen to you vent
---
Safe in wall behind the front counter in Bolton Greens lobby, and a second locked container if you go NE to the "hangar" structure by the cat house.
---
Edit: spelling
---
lol two days ago I had 4 of my dailys autocomplete... including the one for having FIVE completed dailys. Make sure to screenshot and submit it. I am really hoping that they add those point to our totals because that is honestly bullshit. I'm not gonna play this game forever, but how Bethesda responds to issues such as this will refelct how long I choose to commit myself to their game. Whether I am having a blast or not.
---
Also, try unequipping and unequipping it, just to see if that helps
---
Agreed I love pvp but the way Bethesda implemented it in the game makes it dogshit
---
Damn, this just convinced me to buy that pack.
---
...Are you undercover Beth peoples?
---
Bethesda just keeps introducing more glitches and more lag, it's no wonder some of y'all don't like nuclear winter... for me there's only so much I can do in adventure before I get bored.   Adventure pvp is just a resource sink.  I do pvp once in a while, but nothing gets the juices flowing like skill based pvp.
---
I do agree deathmatch would be a whole lot more fun though.
---
I‚Äôve had this problem with the last 4 times I‚Äôve killed the SBQ. There‚Äôs not even been many of us there to bring her down and I was getting loot just fine before with more players doing the event and I‚Äôve not changed my build either so wasn‚Äôt sure myself if it was a bit buggy.
---
This is honestly a great idea
---
When I logged in today it had the gamepass logo so you should be able to go to the store to download it now to play.
---
Settlers Coop Or Raider Enclave
---
Same for me sorta, took over a wolf while doing an event and then teleported away as soon as I shot him
---
Yeah i saw him at my base a week ago. But he teleported away or something. Almost had him 2
---
Itd be too op for whenever the battlepass is over and that item isn't available anymore.
---
I sadly wanted the fireplace... level 99 has me wanting to have a new dream...
---
I already have like 800 hrs, my friends are downloading it to play with me :)
---
Let's be honest. Nuclear Winter isn't fallout. I'm talking about reincorporating PvP BACK into 76.
---
please no
---
Yeah fix the damn fast travel glitch!
---
Most of this I was doing, but love the notes on turbo fert and empath. I think those are sneaky good game changers. Brain bombs is fantastic too, great call
---
I've been doing that same river run for snaptail by starting at the ag center and head to Joe's and I've actually found that if you hop on the banks as well you will find more firecaps you will find even some Starlight berries and fire berries to while you're doing that River Run. It does take a few minutes to adjust to the spawns but I've netted close to 15 firecaps (with green thumbs, 30) in one run.
---
It may have already been said but the area for riding shotgun is accessible outside of the mission and has a ton of brain fungus as well.
---
I found that scrapper almost doubles steel yield from shitty guns. So if I'm low i just pick up all the random guns from scorched/SMs then lumber my overweight ass back to a work bench. In addition to constantly flagging steel.
---
Were you using pip boy or weapon wheel straight away? I have occasionally had 20 - 30 second lockups when I've tried to either change weapons or check my pip boy, but only when I've just logged in. It also treats me as a level 1 player, meaning all my endgame stuff is inaccessible until, I assume, the server and my xbox both agree what level I am
---
Sawft
---
So you can put extra perk cards even after you hit 15 or did I read you response wrong?
---
Yea, it is one of those things where you think to yourself 'it really cannot get any worse...' but then it does!
---
10 caps isn't free.
---
Honestly i only have slots open on my arms. I have cushioned on my legs *just in case* of jetpack failure 
---
Might install ultra light or deep pocketed on them
---
That's true, not the builds I roll though. I know they're beneficial, but I simply like having a full health bar. I don't use PA and rarely put any points in E, so as a squishy build it's truly a must for me, simply just for the ease of never having to fumble for a stimpak during battle. Combined with the other med perks at max rank and I never even need to glance at my health bar. I prefer to save my legendary stats for other things. To each their own though!
---
Yah and there also zetans in suits
---
How have you managed to  convert so many  Notes in to  21,700 Gold Bullion over 85 days .
---
My math says if you Cashed 20 Notes every single Day over 85 Days  = 17,000 Gold Bullion.
---
Please do tell.
---
I am converting 20 Notes a Day in to 200 gold Bullion.
---
I am sat on 700+ Notes that will take me 35 days to cash in.
---
It is killing me.
---
That would be cool but a team death match would add much needed pvp content while still being semi balanced and no punishment if u die
---
Well i know that but i still got to get something out of them
---
Even if a new daily FOR the SS awards you bullion directly for doing something to either raiders or settlers
---
I don‚Äôt have friends but I always ha e a good time
---
You can solo the shit out of this game... And you always could. You will grow accustomed to having other people around, even if you never team up or interact with them in any significant way.
---
It's a good tip for new or intermediate players but for end game players keeping Caps isn't an issue and some players even get to the point where they hit the Caps cap of 30000 Caps too fast. I myself regularly keep over 10000 caps on me at all time.
---
With patch 20 team play got a huge buff so I would recommend against it but the game has greatly improved since pre-wastelanders so give it a shot if you want
---
Well my math may be wrong
---
But I also got the 300 every week and 1000 from the vault raid completion 
---
I need to go over costs and make sure I added them all correctly, but that number should still be in the ballpark. I also think I might be off in days since the release of wastelanders. The margin of error is pretty large when you take uneducated guesses
---
guide on how you got it working :)
---
Those employee signs about 'washing your hands' are just optional right?
---
Unless you have fallout first then there is always a chance that you will encounter someone but in a game with a map size this huge you can often go hours without encountering someone
---
I do too. It means I get more stash space. :D
---
"I don't like something so everyone who does is cancer." 
---
Yeah. Real great attitude. Why don't you look in the mirror because you're the one who's toxic. Don't like PvP in Adventure Mode I've got a real easy solution for you. Don't fucking PvP. It's 100% optional. 
---
And before anyone chimes in with "but the workshop score challenges!" Guess what? You can easily take a workshop and immediately leave without ever getting into PvP. If you have FO1st it's even easier since you have private servers.
---
I know they aren't fascists, but I couldn't resist the alliteration, and could not think of anything else (starting with F) to counterbalance "fav"   :)
---
Stash management is the hardest part of the game.  Being able to have unlimited scrap space is worth it alone.  Plus atoms worth more than I paid anyway.  
---
Then the tent I can place anywhere witg access to a bed, stash, and scrap. And cooking. 
---
Then a private server for engen im getting to do things without people ruining my fun.
---
I've got that damn Nuka Cola song stuck in my head again.
---
Cap/scrip/etc caps are used to encourage use of the currency, but it should always be 5 to 10x the most expensive item sold by vendors. This is basic game design. So cap limit should be about 250k.
---
Scrip amount is about right, actually a bit generous really. 
---
The prob so many legendary beasts dropping crappy legendaries you have to scrap seriously fix the lame ass weapons and raise the cap level so we can trade in these new glorious meat shredders.
---
There are many things about the game that are different and may feel frustrating if you are accustomed to a single player experience.
---
I play solo most of the time and enjoy the game.
---
The only times you really need other players is for a few events or spend your caps at their camps.
---
Also, while hovering over the container, use your mousewheel wheel scroll to highlight, then press e or enter and take the highlighted item only.
---
Did you mean Mama Dulce?
---
That's the fun part - it just started working and I don't know why. However, the change I made that I hadn't tried before was to load in better inventory to see if it would work. It's possible that there's a bug in the custom ini parser such that it won't load just one mod - there must be a comma in the list and therefore 2 or more mods must be loaded.
---
I've had a lot of freezes lately. I had a frozen load screen, too.
---
It's only been since the last update.
---
On true,harder now, Gold Perk Card dont give extra points anymore.
---
Yeah, but there's always someone there within 2 fuckin seconds of the match beginning. I won't be getting this one, I guess.
---
Fireproof and radicol is like peanut butter and jelly.
---
I saw my first one during the quest chain to unlock Encryptid, can't remember the exact building but it was full of ferals.
---
That‚Äôs exactly how I play. All the crops, water purifiers, scavenger station and the junk pile extractor thing are all unlocked and free for anyone to take if they need it. Even when I power up Poseidon and take the workbench there I leave the fusion core generator unlocked so people can take them if they want them. It costs nothing to be kind is the way I see it :)
---
There are no critical hits outside of vats.
---
Are you manually triggering it when using vats?
---
Nope. 15 still max
---
If that's true then that means you literally need to be lvl 350+ to max out 1 legendary perk lol wooooooooow.
---
Not just at events. I killed a Legendary at Wes Tek today and he had nothing at all.
---
Okay, that's what I had thought. Thank you for clarifying
---
How do you do a critical hit out of vats?
---
How tf do you get cobalt flux btw? I cant ever seem to fond any.
---
China? or is it wiped out?
---
Were you on PC by chance?
---
You said free though
---
Ok some weapons have weird damage ranges
---
My LMG can finally be an regulatory used weapon!... im so getting this perk
---
Thanks for the help I‚Äôve made sure to do so
---
I would probably focus on the secret service armor first as that'll be most beneficial to your stealth rifle build. Once you get that you might want to focus on some of the camp enhancement stuff like the garden tiles and ammo maker, or if you want to change up your build a bit, the Gauss Shotgun.
---
&gt;That's the fun part - it just started working and I don't know why. 
---
Did this make it feel **even more** like your day job?
---
No I‚Äôm on xbox
---
i have been using tasty squirrel stew, i get a 25% exp buff with carnivore
---
A few times. Once he took control of Sentry Bots at Whitespring
---
Theres also a safe in the cabins by the east end of the bridge I  flatwoods. 
---
I've played 3 games, and the 2 times we did Morgantown Mamas was empty or the one person who spawned there hauled ass away.
---
do not forget to eat some Tasty Squirrel stew and crunch on a leader bobblehead
---
Oof....i cant read my own stuff üò≠i will fix that
---
I mostly play by myself with no issues. It can be a grind starting out, the 20-30s can be tough.
---
Just give it a shot, maybe you'll like it. Not everything is for everyone, nor should it be.
---
Was curious cuz had one an hour or 2 ago and there were a handful of people there, maybe half the server present to kill the queen
---
Yes, that. I just always call it that like an accidental running gag, sorry
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right.  I took five workshops last night, one right after the other, without any PvP.
---
It‚Äôs really fun in my opinion there‚Äôs bugs and glitches nothing too game breaking and the community is amazing unless ur an asshole while ur making ur character someone will prolly craft u full armor and give u a couple guns and drop it outside the vault that‚Äôs pretty common
---
When Whitesprings gets nuked check the area just north of it behind the buildings. Look for anything with a blue hue. Using the green thumb perk you can easily get 40 or so raw cobalt flux. It's the hardest flux to get lots of for sure.
---
I'm in a similar boat. I bought it back on launch and couldn't get into it. I bought it for PC this week and I'm enjoying it a lot more with wastelanders and I think PC is more active. I'd say so far 76 has been decent at least and pretty fun so far. The biggest drawback for me is knowing I'm so far behind everyone.
---
Concrete bunker?...
---
Holy crap. Only if they added brabwire and you can make your own Western Front
---
The sap on trees turn into cobalt? I think?
---
You could spawn by the back door hole and unlock that while they loot.
---
I think they are referring to double damage you get for head shots. If you have the damage numbers showing on screen. Normal damage is white, head shot damage is yellow....
---
Yeah Man, grind is way too long, dont Worth it, ps7 Will be out and no One have at least 3 Lv 4 legendary perks without using any exp exploit.
---
We forgive you and love you
---
At least let us "Knock over" our tables/chairs/lamps etc and give us clutter.
---
Yea, Carnivore mutation w/stranger in numbers, and max that INT while your at it... I'll admit I'm lazy and stick with the canned meat for 12% though.
---
Unyielding armor with herd mentality and egg head as well.  This battle pass has birthed a new build.
---
Other than a few skins nothing has changed
---
Yeah I figured that was the issue, as the benches could place and snap fine, but as soon as I tried to do a vendor, its like it was sinking through the foundation. Blueprinting is a good idea, I didn't think of that at the time, but probably would have made my job a hell of a lot easier lol
---
It's not that bad üôÑ
---
:) I look forward to it
---
There HAS to be some risk involved in PvP that's the whole point.
---
Thanks üòò
---
I still want them to bring in an arena like The Pitt or NukaWorld. The concept has been in the game before and is doable. 
---
Have it run like an event, maybe rotate between teamed and one on one rounds for a champ. Once you join it temporarily disables pacifist. Winner gets caps or a legendary item like an event reward.
---
Have u never played a team death match? You lose that‚Äôs the risk that‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been so popular across generations of gaming. Like yeah I understand there should be a risk but a tdm would be the best way to do it, but why fight when Bethesda will do neither things were suggesting
---
Oh nice to know. This explains why mine completed so quickly
---
This game at launch was imo very much so as bad as people said it was. This game now is not nearly as bad as it once was (although it isnt in the realm of perfect or completely fixed either). It's definitely worth a try.
---
Same here, I even stood up and didn't sneak whilst I did it. Was constantly watching my back expecting to be yeeted but it never came.
---
If you call the RNG gifts tradeable instead of crap. Then I'm not sure what purveyor you have been visiting. I'm surprised Bethesda hasn't added the legendary feather that "does MINUS damage, but makes your enemy smile üòÉ" and has a 99% RNG drop rate.
---
I'm only level 40, so take this with a grain of salt, but this is exactly just a Fallout MMO. It has that Fallout charm, but with the trappings of a grind-heavy MMO
---
I have all of my stuff unlocked and in the open by the Wayward because I hope new players *do* take it. I also have a ton of cheap plans, food, and stimpaks in my vendor, along with free purified water. I want people to take it if they need it. The only time I get kind of annoyed is when I see people 200+ clearing it out just to sell it for more, but even then I know that's a risk I take.
---
I'm a lowly junk dealer. I sell all bulked items (minus steel, that's for me only), and components that can't be bulked. Everything is listed at half times retail.
---
The only thing I mark up is stable flux. I usually go 2.5 times retail, but I've seen people selling it up to six times. I'm still not sure if I'm ripping others off, or myself off =/
---
All in all, junk is my life, and I get by just fine from only selling to other players. If you can save up a couple hundred pounds of junk, you can make some good bank when you get bought out.
---
I did a regular photomode one and yesterdays CAMP deployment one and have 2/3 completed, so I would say so. I haven't done the lockpick one today
---
Two times.  First time near my camp, took a shot at him and he vanished.  Second time near Thunder Mountain someone else was fighting it so I joined in and we killed it.
---
Not just this, but all pop-ups.  
---
Legendary Weapons  
---
Quest/Event Start/Completion  
---
SCORE Rewards   
---
  
---
This is a quality of life issue that should have been gone in the beta. 
---
 
---
Make it 60% smaller and put it in the top right corner.
---
Mouse wheel
---
I'll have to check later.
---
I used to lock mines but I don‚Äôt care anymore
---
You got the atoms when you sign up yes
---
Critical hits are not power attacks.  While you use VATS to fight you fill up a meter, once full you can use it to do a critical hit.  On the Xbox you press Y while in vats with a full meter just prior to executing the attack.
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying it too. Got my eye on a few things namely the star wallpaper, chicken coop and the planetarium at lvl 100 lol! We‚Äôll see if I get that far haha.
---
Don't fool yourself into thinking our desires or bug feedback gets to the devs. Devs are part of a team and fix what is asked of them based on managers prioritizing the projects. Once in a while the community voices something and it's acknowledged but there's bugs in this game that has been around since beta.
---
Isn't Power Sprinter pretty pointless? You can just max Legendary Strength and get Full Charge instead. You'll have no fusion core drain while sprinting and have 3 extra slots. Or am I missing something?
---
Lol thank you very much now that makes sense.
---
So basically you played for the horizontal progression is what I'm taking away from this? More power to you but if you prefer to play for 20-50 atoms a day then what were you doing with them? Buying things I suppose? 
---
Atoms aren't gated behind the season pass at all just to be clear, but they are more scarce to come by if you don't do it, sure!
---
You're saying you only played for "fake" or horizontal progression. You can still play this same way after the track was introduced. I don't really understand this? 
---
If you pushed for upwards of 150+ atoms a day I would understand more you'd be hurt by this stuff but getting 35 on average a day was your *only* reason to play...? You can still get cosmetics (the only thing atoms can get) by playing the legendary run AND you get atoms on top of it. 
---
I think your idea of playing for the atoms is twisting the fact that the end goal of the previous system and current systems are the **exact same thing**. The cosmetics are just more strict and themed on top of getting extra atoms for any in betweens you want to control purchases for still. If you care **that** much about something in the shop then you have the option to pay for it. 
---
Again, I see where you're coming from but your statement implies you played for fake progression and not real gameplay. If that's how you had fun more power to you! It's fair to not play a game if you're not getting enjoyment out of it, it sounds like you're not pleased with being able to essentially grind everything you want out of the atom shop specifically and not the actual gameplay however.
---
Oh and apparently shotguns are exceptional at completing this challenge since they spread and each piece counts as a seperate critical hit.
---
Ditch it and grind the repeatable weekly one instead. In 2 hours you possibly could at least have had one probably 2 repeats of that. You only need 2 and a half to make up the shortfall by not doing the NW challenge
---
Yes. And the beans. They don't glow, therefore they're a bit easy to miss.
---
In Morgantown, there are crop plants that turn into cobalt. Multi-fruit for sure. I think corn too. Someone else will have to chime in for Morgantown's cobalt plants.
---
Inert flux is better than water, it gives +5 Disease Resistance and it weighs less.
---
Nope. You can sell them to players though via a vending machine at your CAMP
---
That is so stupid. Having good NPC vendors is the reason why you don't kill them in Fallout 3 or New Vegas.
---
But I want to do it as a completionist.
---
and is it just for vault steel and legendary modules or is the rng game also reduced to 75 scrip for 3*?
---
Just have fun with it and spawn near the airport, you‚Äôll get lucky and be alone with your team sooner or later.. it took me like an hour and I played my 3 matches all the way through. Have fun with it human(gotta keep it gender appropriate nowadays)it‚Äôs supposed to be a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù.
---
Not to mention for fallout first members if they want to charge that much they need to either double the storage space or make it unlimited like the scrap box.
---
Yea ive done 5 nukes since yesterday and I've only gotten 1 from a reward drop, problem is they've all been down south east by the fissure
---
It‚Äôs not that easy to get scammed? What happened
---
Do the ranged weapon damage boost and the damage resist for matching armor still exist or were those scrapped for the whiners?
---
And yes. I knew I was going to get backlash for my post but I honestly dgaf
---
I thought Very Well Rested is the bonus from opening a lunchbox.
---
This engine wasn't made for PvP. Plain and simple.
---
For everything I believe
---
Follow Through seems like it would be OP.  The melee perks are useless.  Guess it's time to start shooting.
---
I've had great luck with the bank in Morgantown, not always perfect but pretty easy to catch the location clear. It has 3 or 4 locks so if you wait around in a bush and go after any nearby spawns go through you will still have a lock to open. *there goes my happy place*..
---
Both players dropped the items for trade at same time and he didn‚Äôt drop what he said he was going to then he ran.
---
You only get Well Rested from the Communal Firepit. Very Well Rested comes from Lunch Boxes if I'm not mistaken.
---
Never go first
---
'Bethesda' 'fix'   
---
Sorry, these words don't go together.
---
I told my bf that, but they dropped at the same time, and he was dirty and didn‚Äôt drop what he said he was going to. But yes, more caution next time!
---
&gt; it‚Äôs supposed to be a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù. 
---
That logic kind of falls apart when one of the "challenges" is built 5 of anything, eat ten food, ect.
---
Grenades, the Fatman is A weapon so it won't work
---
You had to jinx it.
---
Submit a ticket
---
Pawn to king's 4
---
in before deleted for witch hunting..
---
BOS is making an appearance soon so I find this likely in the future but maybe not in the sense you expect.
---
You're right. It wasn't as bad as I thought. When I figured out exactly where to place my spawn point, I was able to nab the toolbox and the floor safe in the next match, and then got the toolbox again in the match after that(the safe was also untouched so I left it for someone else).
---
You could add line in the sand too?
---
Is that a fishing joke?
---
It's worth noting that the High Cap backpack provides 60 additional weight and does NOT reduce DR. It does reduce RR and ER but the only energy attacks I an think of off the top  of my head are SB sonic attacks, Imposter/Assaultron Lasers (which usually just kill you regardless), and Robobrain Teslas.
---
Oh hey. They‚Äôre way better than before. Also glad they combined Hacking/Lockpicking into one card.
---
YES!!!  Despite all mine being random glitches, would be an interesting gallery..
---
Yea that would be awesome. Things to include would be an Ammo box (stash), A camouflage tent, and maybe a damaged military vehicle that you add to your camp (like the tank or the transport).
---
Are you wearing PA? Had the same issue. Stepped out of my PA and can view the terminal
---
NVM, did it right now. Whining winning, I suppose.
---
It also wasn't made for online multiplayer but here we are. 
---
If you don't have the maturity to simply not participate in an optional feature you dislike instead of spewing toxicity all over the internet then maybe online games aren't for you.
---
I can‚Äôt argue with that lol. I was just hoping to help relieve some of the pressure by giving a different outlook on the situation.
---
My guess is when they reset the Daily Challenges...about noonish Eastern US Time.
---
You do have a strong point. Having all available wall pieces visible at once is annoying, and the individual categories in 4 is much better on that.
---
I wouldn't worry about being to far behind, just enjoy it. The end game is lacking anyway.
---
There is, if you want to farm materials after every run. There‚Äôs a reason the phrase ‚Äúburning thousands in a couple of seconds‚Äù exist, and this is one of them.
---
You‚Äôll be so much happier with a Gatling or another weapon, I promise.
---
You get them when completing abbies bunker quests
---
I would say if your are mid late game yes they are fairly easy to get
---
I'm pretty sure you can do crits outside of vats if you use overdrive, haven't tested it in ages tho.
---
If you are starting out then I would wait until you are around level 30-40 before you start grinding for achievements
---
from wiki
---
&gt; Random rewards for completing Event: Fertile Soil, Event: Fly Swatter, Event: Project Beanstalk, Event: Tea Time, Event: Feed the People, Event: Leader of the Pack, Event: Back on the Beat, Event: The Path to Enlightenment, Event: Collision Course and Daily: Ecological Balance, Daily: Strange Brew.
---
&gt; Low chance of being rewarded for completing Daily: Mistaken Identity, Horde events, Hunter/Hunted PVP, and all Powering Up Quests.
---
I have yet to get a plan for these or to see/notice one being sold at a player vendor.
---
I think we‚Äôre saying the same thing and I was agreeing with you? I was just using an electronics store as an analogy for test driving merchandise before buying.
---
Yeah but apparently if you post a pic with the name and call them out it's ok lol.
---
Ok ty
---
They always do the opposite anyway... Mmmm I have an idea.
---
Hey bethesda! Don't fix any bugs.
---
Don't add any new content.
---
Do not offer the fallout 1st subscription for free.
---
Yep, I struggle selling my unwanted legendaries for 50 caps/star Idk how he is listing things for 250 caps/star.
---
Also, it seems the scrip vendor isn't in his normal place as the door is open and he's just missing from the building. Any idea what's up with that?
---
I have played since the stress test..
---
Has thier deceptive marketing, poor execution, and hard pressed monetization replaced my blind love for Bethesda with negative feelings and shattered trust?  Yuh.
---
Do I still enjoy countless hours of gameplay? Heck yea.  If you cant accept less then flawless gameplay your in the wrong place, because shtuff can get pretty weird; but it's usually minor inconveniences rather then game breaking.
---
I rate this game 7 handicapped hamsters on chems.
---
I sell a lot of ballistic ammo, and use the caps to buys energy ammo and railway spikes.
---
+2 to all stats when grouped. -2 to all stats when alone. +3 with Strange in numbers. This has been the case.
---
I don't know about distance.
---
That's not fallout PvP, that's just PvP
---
Only thing good about first now is the stash box.  It‚Äôs totally worth teaming up on adventure and you don‚Äôt have to talk to anyone
---
ps crowd has been pretty good, met alot of people during events that were doing the follow me emote so i could get a hit on a legendary
---
Likely not a major grind. They seem to only be awarded from the Colossal Problem event, and there are only a few of them...at least for now.
---
Which platform?
---
Get an idea of how you would like to play and then go to nukesanddragons.com and create your own custom build. Take your time and look through the perk cards. Your never stuck picking a perk from a category, when you level up you can put a point in STR and pick a card from int if you wish.
---
Now that's something I'd drop money on.
---
Do those guys get to see this type of posts?
---
Congrats...!
---
I'd like to see different bots too, not just Protectrons. Maybe even some voice lines! 
---
My only complaint with this skin is the animation/noise plays CONSTANTLY. It should only be when activated.
---
But they want us to play NW soooooo bad
---
Xbox 1
---
There are a few serums with text changes, but they don‚Äôt appear to have been implemented yet.

Saw one in west tek. I was stealth running through it and it was fighting the super mutants behind the security door.  I got one shot on it
---
I know it makes me sad legit
---
Yeah I was just curious because when I read the description in game that‚Äôs what it said ( have to be nearby) was kinda confused because haven‚Äôt heard anyone talk about it like that.
---
New location called the Rusty Pick is where you'll find Murmgh, it's kinda southwest-ish from Charlston Capitol Building
---
I mean everyone could work on bug fixes or testing right??!
---
I really, really love the skin but I'm about to get rid of it because it plays so damn often. It should only be when you interact with the vending machine, not all the time. It got old almost immediately.
---
I know
---
If you're not opposed to switching a few points you could always move them into Luck and up your Crit game.
---
So do you think it‚Äôs a future nerf that will be implemented because of the new team feature?
---
Or the death at the event  glitch that crap is game breaking
---
Yeah I did the same thing, just hop back in adventure after and maybe do something to earn xp (craft food or something simple) and it should be fine.
---
I am confused... all I know is that this is wrong and that player deserves to be called out for what they did! Hopefully it will stop others from being stolen from.
---
It literally just means "while you're on a team"
---
Also since someone else brought up the mutation I should begrudgingly let you know it's currently the most viable and broken mutation. It never says you have to have teammates, so with the introduction of public teams you never suffer the negative SPECIAL stats so long as you make a public team whenever you join a lobby. Constant +3 to everything, enjoy it and check up on your local Ranger platoon. üëå
---
I usually see him once every week or two. He really should drop something interesting.
---
Yea dont sweat about it, many high tier players have used xp, cloning, and numerous other old exploits to get where they are.. Not a realistic goal.  The biggest drawback of being new would be that a few daily/weekly challenges may prove harder to complete, for this purpose I've started playing as my old character again.
---
Or attract a scorchedbeast?
---
Are you playing the music enough? The jukebox should always be on, and you may need someone to sacrifice themselves and play an instrument if the jukebox keeps getting destroyed.
---
I've played that event dozens of time and never had the wendigo not show up. Oneshot, sure, but the corpse is always there.
---
I‚Äôve also had some friends say they‚Äôve been getting stuck in their power armor. I can deal with restarting the game every once and awhile for stuff like that. It sucks yes, but when your having to go back and click the map icon on the map 3-4 times every time you fast travel... really irritating
---
It's hilarious to me when I'm on an event team for a long while with the same people and every time I look on the map they are in the same spot at their camp. Would really love to know what the point is, but I'm not going to complain about a free bonus and maybe a shared perk lol.
---
The raider canopies! I've wanted those forever. Most of my settlements in FO4 used them, they bring the whole look of the settlement together.
---
Should just be a skin for all PA.
---
*CAN NOT PLACE ITEM: THE WORKSHOP'S BUDGET HAS BEEN EXCEEDED*
---
If you're on xbox I can just paint your set for you
---
Not going to lie, I love Skyrim.
---
Dang, PS4 unfortunately
---
Mmm delicious XP all for yourself, with the right Int boosts I‚Äôm able to hit the Score XP repeatable like 3/4 times during Rad Rumble
---
Had that a few times myself, it is strange just do a building team for the xp from kills then.   
---
Though had two rad rumbles today that we were done in a few minutes we had 12 people in it both times it was nice.
---
My first, I'd say 500 hours or so we're all solo. Very soloable.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true I just find it funny. At least maybe change to a building group if you‚Äôre gonna just chill at your camp
---
Yeah I bought the mutation because of this but I read the description before using it and it literally says that you have to be next to your teammates. I‚Äôm wondering if this is just a mis text that‚Äôs been like this forever or if it‚Äôs somthing Bethesda just added because they intend on nerfing it in the future
---
What is a cursed weapon?
---
This every time. I join a world and join a public event team. If im lucky one other person is doing an event.
---
Ive found that the builder teams (+INT) are found more often at events. So if i see them at events I just join them now.
---
I like joining on my private server and not worry about if a player has already killed a specific monster(s) or taken a certain item on said server. 
---
The unlimited stash box is the best part of it atm.
---
Everything else is just skins/emote &amp; icons
---
I haven‚Äôt tried that yet!
---
Nice. Yeah I made my own building group.
---
If you go to the trading sub you'll find someone there to do ot for caps I'm sure.
---
Aaah bummer, you must be right.  I did accidentally open one today... deleted post
---
That would be awesome
---
Once in a while.... fun fight, loot not memorable though
---
Also works with beam splitter from laser rifles.
---
Been playing solo for 1100 hours,  i now find public teams are awesome.. go figure!
---
Never trade without a trusted courier
---
When does the legendary perk system go live?
---
I did that event for the first time yesterday. I ended up being the only one getting ore (ended up getting 65 of them). It was just NOT fun running around collecting those ores. So, now I just avoid that event.
---
Those new settlers in the Forest even have silt beans and pumpkins planted in their farm. Drives me insane for ones that are clearly crops. The wild ones I sort of get, but if I can literally see settlers planting them, why can't I?! 
---
It'd be a really cool Responders questline where you have to unlock a special fertilizer or something to plant them in your CAMP. Maybe even a unique one for each type of plant.
---
Does each pellet have a chance to proc Grim reapers sprint also? Not related to the topic, just curious..
---
Gun Fu is doing it for me.
---
Increased damage at the cost of durability
---
Yeah, this is what a friend showed me, so extra carryweight, endurance,  health regen, extra xp, all from just making a team up by yourself. It's a good move.
---
You can fast travel by finding name on team list. It‚Äôs one of the choices next to the name when you highlight it.
---
Okay some of these will certainly fit my play style, so I'm much happier.  I don't get the poison/fire or exploding ones at all.  It sounds purely cosmetic.  Why not confetti? Are there other perks that will cause an enemy explosion chain reaction?
---
It's probably the better choice if you're going for maximum exp gains in most cases. I'd make an argument event teams are better for certain situations with coordinated teams, but in general with randoms building is the way to go. Best is to switch from building to event right before the event completes then switch back. Absolutely maximize your gains that way lol
---
I lost a full set of x-01 last month I‚Äôm just sick and tired of putting money and time into something that constantly stresses me out
---
Fresh meat in NW, just in time for double xp.
---
I‚Äôd like to see red rocket or nuke cola bot vendors. My diner style camp is split with one side nuka cola/red rocket and the other side slocum‚Äôs. My red rocket side just has the default vendors. Would be cool to have vendors on that side more in theme.
---
Give me a "try before you buy" option.
---
Oh it‚Äôs a new prefix!? That‚Äôs great
---
If I'm wrong please correct me but I thought the only way to crit is through VATS.
---
The best teams are builder 99% of the time and switch to event team right before they end an event
---
I'm going to check it out
---
It's the rads. So many people are bloodied, it isn't worth the hassle.
---
Yeah, it might even give bloodied a run for its money damage wise although I couldn't confirm this as I've not been on the PTS
---
Yeah i think it can be a pretty fun event if there‚Äôs plenty of people working together but that‚Äôs not often the case. I don‚Äôt know what can be done to fix it.
---
wait they aren't? wtf
---
Is that the first second or third star of a legendary weapon? Because if its the second I dont see myself giving up seing speed for my gauntlet.
---
Why on Earth would they make Fire Lining and Antivenom *not* work with power armor? Another asinine decision...
---
a great chance to get rid of these thousands of mounted xyz plans, drop them at the vault entrance or overseers camp!   
---
btw, the responders corpse right of the entrance, does it hold a 10mm or pipe pistol? will drop some ammo there, i remember my first start was quite annoying with these 3 or something bullets...
---
I didn't want to invite an NPC into my home
---
The first star
---
It is but more luck=quicker bar fill up.
---
Yeah I get that, I‚Äôm bloodied. I just use a hazmat suit. Clear all my rads at the start, by the end of the event I‚Äôm practically back to where I started.
---
And use that like a travel/fast travel point like Fallout 4 had?
---
lol exactly, I honestly don't mind the mode too much but the forced dailies combined with hackers isn't fun.
---
All I'm happy about is not having to change my disc when I want to play 76
---
Often in West tec lol, disappointing rewards.
---
The purple glow is cool
---
Possibly? But what if you could call it to radio towers to use it as a fast travel point ?. Lol I‚Äôm sorry the more I think about this the more ideas I‚Äôm having lol.
---
Vault Tec University Diplomas?
---
I just wish we could do wallpaper inside
---
Better yet, ammo cans we can just put ammo into and sandbag walls.
---
it holds a pipe pistol.
---
Seriously PS4 needs this jealous of you Xbox peeps wish we had cross play between PS4 and Xbox
---
You are the reason why I wish there was friendly fire in the game.
---
In FO4, you could technically have it take you anywhere you placed your marker.
---
People always buy my disease cures. A hot ticket item for sure.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by "fake" or horizontal progression. 
---
What I enjoy first and foremost is story content. Wastelanders was awesome until the story content ran out, but I don't mind doing the daily faction quests so I can earn bullion and rep. I've already gotten Allied status with Foundation, and I plan to get Allied status with The Crater for the achievement.
---
But the biggest incentive to log in every day when there's no more story content is to earn Atoms. I'll admit, I tend to hoard them as I have over 5500 Atoms right now. But I like to know that I have the Atoms if I something comes into the shop that I want.
---
Even with 20-50 Atoms earned per day, that's 600-1500 Atoms I earn in a month. The new seasonal structure cuts that down by a large margin. For me, that means that there's much less incentive to log in every day.
---
I've never spent real money to buy Atoms, instead using the Atoms I've earned to buy things I want. I don't think this is a flaw with the game, but rather the lack of enticing things to buy in the Atom shop.
---
I think that, rather than cutting down how many Atoms you could earn, they should have focused more on creating more appealing cosmetics and camp items to purchase. 
---
The seasonal structure awards me with stuff that I don't want and wouldn't spend Atoms to get, so it feels like I'm getting fewer rewards for more effort. At least I could choose what I wanted with Atoms.
---
Based on the harpoon gun someone posted being 400 damage, I doubt it. A bloodied harpoon gun w/o damage perks at 20% health with adrenal is 550-600 damage and 900+ with perks.
---
What region are you in? It would be the 9th for America.
---
For $5 a week? 
---
Easy.  But if I wasn't playing fallout76 as much as I currently do, I would cancel it.
---
Usually noon is server reset. So probably then
---
I know I loved the feature in FO4 lol it was so cool.
---
Collecting ore is missing all that easy XP for score.
---
On safes
---
You'll want to look at Crit Savvy. Alternatively you can leave the points in Agility and use Gun-Fu... But I highly recommend pairing that with Grim Reapers Spirit on a rifle build.
---
No worries. I'd love to know.
---
In my head I upvoted this post like a million times, I love the idea especially the ‚Äòdefend C.A.M.P‚Äô option. The C.A.M.P Vertibird would need a few extra hit points to make it worthwhile though as I‚Äôve seen Super Mutants with fruity farts knock them out the sky. Still a good idea though.
---
thanks. a chance to put these .38 to good use :)
---
Without Fallout 1st, there's no private server option. However, with the latest patch, Bethesda made it pretty much impossible to get griefed, so while you'll still be on the map with other people, it's much easier now to just regard them as NPCs and not worry about getting killed.
---
What's nice about having other people on the map is that they can have vendors, and there's a chance they will be selling things you need for significantly cheaper than an NPC might be. No need to interact with the other players whatsoever.
---
Honestly wish it would of shown up on the Xbox game pass for PC as well already, but sadly seems like XGP for PC are still stuck waiting until possibly tomorrow :(
---
Orwell Orchards has a wall safe upstairs in the main house for flatwoods. For Morgantown you can go to the southern point of Monongah. There‚Äôs a trailer with a safe there.
---
What do you plan on playing next? Im in the same boat. I might start the Metro series of games
---
If you think you'll die keep your inventory lower than max üëç
---
interested in trading any of the jumpsuits?
---
A lot of people just can't be bothered to do that. If I were in an event team I would probably do it if my teammates were but normally it's one that I ignore.
---
Plasma crossbow is really good 
---
Best used with all the sneaking damage perks you can grab, the crossbow is registered as absolutely noiseless by the game, meaning it's even quieter than weapons with a silencer 
---
However if you do get spotted by anything and you're facing more than 2 enemies, I would have a backup weapon handy
---
It just means team. They don‚Äôt really have to be near.
---
Oh dang it's not random! Right I'm going in!!
---
Innert flux is heavy. Heavier than water.
---
Want to know this too, sorry for getting your hopes up with the notification op. My best guess is yes.
---
Thanks, ill have a look
---
I'm one of these players, running out of things to buy at NPC vendors. But I still enjoy the cap grind.
---
I would love to have this in-game. My C.A.M.P.s backstory is that it was a prewar U.S. military facility/ listening outpost that was used to spy on anti-American activity (free states) lol.
---
UPVOTE!!!

Yeah, can't add anything you didn't say other than I specifically want shoulder length hair with a bald cranium.
---
And bigger and longer moustaches
---
&gt;spent all my scrip last night
---
Ouch.
---
Or Bethesda could catch up to games from 2005 and give us a fucking text chat.
---
It sucks
---
Only 600 here, but still spent it all.  DOHü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Did that event for the first time yesterday and I have a heavy weapons build, had power armor, but was alone half the event and just constantly died
---
I know that‚Äôs how it is currently. But dose anyone know for certain if this is how the description always was or has it been updated to saying ‚Äúnearby‚Äù recently?
---
Fair enough
---
Interesting...I guess I missed the wall of text.
---
Were you using explosives by any chance?
---
Honestly congrats dude, every melee kill is an accomplishment seriously 
---
It's hard af even with all the perks and best weapons
---
Somebody come burp the baby
---
Nah. Just play it and decide for yourself.
---
Australia but it's currently past midnight in austin (where f76 was made)
---
Nuke Morgantown. Tons of mutfruit around that turn into cobalt
---
Thats not so bad. Considering i don't care much for the first stsr all that much having the extra damage might be useful for some creatures i don't 1 shot like the You Goai bears.
---
The daily NW challenges for 250 points I dont mind skipping.. but the weekly challenge for 1k points sucks! I know half of the time they're super easy to complete, but I hate battle royales... I dont want to contribute to artificially inflating the number of players for that mode and make them think more people like it. I wish they would/ would have added more pvp mode options like tdm &amp; ctf etc...
---
Needs more explosions.
---
China, lots and lots and lots and lots of new lore
---
The game is/has already made them much richer than they were. They have no interest in fixing it any more than they have to. Not with new games on the horizon.
---
I think they go off eastern standard time which means it is just past 1am.
---
...or they could literally just add a menu option for "OPT INTO PVP?" And make you enemies with everyone else on the server that also turned it on.
---
Bethesda has to make the most simple things extremely convoluted.
---
Is the sale an actual sale or just mystery pick
---
amen
---
Yeah I joked about ghouls but I‚Äôve probably died more to them than anything else. I think all of them were previously in the NFL. Doesn‚Äôt help that I think blocker is bugged.
---
how to get
---
NPC‚Äòs were introduced with the wastelander update. And you can raid Vault 79 with the raiders or the settlers
---
It's a sale.
---
I hate the Morgantown map but everyone seems to pick it. Flatwoods is so much better for us Bush wookie gang
---
But you can get ghillie suit in NW....
---
Oui that‚Äôs nice or melee builds viable? Should I respec or make a new character? And are there any perks or benefits from choosing raiders or settlers?
---
Hey team, do we want Radiation Rumble?
---
(team): "Claim the Workshop!"
---
What about project paradise?
---
(Team): "Claim the other Workshop!"
---
...godammit...
---
(Team): "Defend the Workshop!"
---
I sell serums. Every time I get 20,000 caps I buy a new plan.   Since the team thing I figured I‚Äôd buy Herd mentality cause people will be into it. When I read the ‚Äúnearby‚Äù part I too, wondered what that meant. So I googled it and found that it has said that for a while and people confirmed it just meant teams. I mean take it and if it changes just cure it. That‚Äôs what I plan to do.
---
i used to run adrenaline 5 and switched just to what i got. have like 20 level ups remaining but i dont want to waste points for something, thats (hopefully!) fixed in short time.  
---
i switched to gun fu 3, marathoner 1 and white knight 1 (completly useless as stealth build but i just got thru hiker 2 and 3). thinking about getting rid of gun fu also, its slow af...
---
Yup. Twice. Once by the little pond not far from vault 76 and the other near the cliffs by top of the world.
---
Isn't there already a vaulted NW unlocked ghillie suit that came and went ages ago?
---
wait... does this make it a "Nerf Herder"
---
But it's lighter than water ice.
---
Yes one shot him
---
Will ammo factory mean I can main prime receiver weapons now?
---
to hide the weapon...
---
(angry logic noises)
---
Could have made it

Fucking

---
Considering that culture STOPPED largely in the 50's then you wouldn't have more modern looks and 'hair colors a certain group' uses to draw attention to themselves.    
---
What 'body types'? In a world where food, clean water, and medicine isn't readily available like it is then you're NOT going to have fat people. It's highly unlikely you'll have body builders and super fit/toned professional athletes as well. Clarify what you mean by 'more body types'.    
---
In such a world, clothing would not fit super tight. It would be loose on both sexes.
---
Theres two at mama Dulles. A Florida safe in the office and a toolbox by the hole in the back wall to the right
---
Not really. Rolling the Purveyor at earlier levels will keep a few things out of your loot pool, but you‚Äôll still need to be level 20 to get Fixers. If you want them max level you‚Äôll need to be 50+ anyway.
---
slocum joe package
---
Nukashine for everyone!
---
Yeah, I've been experiencing worse server performance across the board since the patch. I'm on PC
---
Cool thanks for the reply!
---
The meta now is bloodied stealth or junkie weapons. Not perks but different stuff like weapons. With max raiders reputation you can buy plans for the Gauss minigun and with max settlers reputation you can buy plans for the Gauss shotgun. Also during the settler main quest you get the plans for the Chinese stealth suit as a quest reward. And yes, you can max your reputation for both factions but it‚Äôs a hell of a grind
---
It won't be as bad as free to play. 
---
Gold free to play is prominent because who doesn't have Gold and also uses the deals. 
---
Game Pass is a different beast though and i don't believe such a long term invested game is in everyone's agenda. 
---
I think we'll have a healthy influx but not the hit and run of free to play days.
---
Sigh.... modders 
---
Just play the game
---
I did this as an experiment but I haven't played my alt since I scored a bloodied, explosive Fixer on my main.
---
But the theory goes, if you only have that pattern learnt and avoid learning other weapon types, I think it increases your chances on Fixer rolls.
---
Is it the same Firebreatherd suit you get from the quest?
---
Exactly
---
My strategy: 
---
(claiming workshop)
---
(other player spawns)
---
(monty python voice): "Run Away!"
---
Tenderizer lvl 3 is alright.
---
(watches corpse of Legendary Mr Gutsy explode and fly away into the distance)
---
I'm not sure how culture of the 50s has much to do with the limiting of cosmetics, nor do I feel the point about the prevalence of fat or super fit people are relevant. We already can have overweight or extremely athletic bodies in the game. I'm more interested not in the various categories of body types, but specifically to alter the player's body in more specific ways. To clarify, I'd like if players had more of an ability to change their character's body in ways beyond the simple triangle of thin v muscly v fat. I'd like to be able to modify specific parts of the body instead, just like how the customization system allows you to manipulate various parts of the face.
---
My junkies SS sheepsquatch staff did around  900 damage without maxed 2h perks... so yeah.  Add in sneak and power attack and everything but bosses are one tapped
---
rob smiley
---
Number of times I've LBed to zoom in out of habit with camera and binoculars. Only to find the scopes don't do that
---
That hood comment secured my upvote lol.
---
No.    
---
The skins can be used by other char's you create but not given out. If they want them they'll put in the time.
---
It should be possible to code with flipping panels. Have it trigger to "Good morning!" at 6 AM in-game and "Good evening!" at 6 PM in-game ‚Ä¶ you know, when Nocturnal kicks on and off. I mean, the time's already coded into the game as when A Thing Happens, you can use the same code to trigger the flip, I'd think.
---
Damn ok what would you recommend to go for first? Mini gun or shotgun?
---
in my first 250 hours of gameplay, I only ever saw him once. then, by some bizarre luck, I've seen four different times in the month or two.
---
Only for a handful of weapons though. Most weapons show up in the pool even if you don't get their plans. Basically the fixer, bear arm, sheepsquatch weapons and all the gold bullion weapons are the only ones that rely on the plam., The rest are in the loot pool initially.
---
Yes, soon to be replaced with auto-not completion.
---
Roof of the bank has a chest
---
Ingram mansion second floor by the bed has a wall safe
---
Monogah mine has one in a shack outside
---
The barn has one inside it‚Äôs north of Bolton green, which also has a wall safe in the first floor ummm caddy area I call it, but it‚Äôs not always active.
---
There‚Äôs also a safe underneath a porch in a house on east side of Morgantown but I haven‚Äôt been there in awhile so tougher to describe.
---
I ended today just barely into 27 with only one weekly left
---
They're trash and bethesda should just add them to the regular nade pool
---
They went battle royal because pubg and fortnite were raking in millions. They figured they could cash in. But as stated  in these posts Beth didn‚Äôt figure that their player base didn‚Äôt really want it.  Fallout it about immersion, not pvp.   Sure. Go clear raiders all day, then take your time looting the area.  NW was tacked on with the goal of money. Not improving the game.
---
Ahh ok, that makes sense.
---
Honestly I went with the settlers first because of the stealth suit but I recommend going for the max raiders rep first since you can buy the plans for a ammo machine. It can craft almost every ammo type for free except 2mm cartridges Fusion and plasma core and ultracite ammo
---
And huge sideburns.
---
Minigun is a lot of small damage fast, shotgun is a lot of big damage slowly. Same ending though, hopefully your enemies are all dead.
---
Oh nice are you on Xbox? If so would you mine just like guiding me through? That ammo machine sound nice but bloodied stealth can you remind me what bloodied does?
---
I hope they don‚Äôt nerf it but sadly if they updated the text Im going to assume they‚Äôre intending to
---
Anyone else feel like these are going to drop and all the 'melee/unarmed explosive' perks are just going to kill us?
---
What‚Äôs your Gamertag?
---
Cry me a river
---
And no. PvP in other games works fine. Bethesda needs to fix the way the engine if they want PvP in this game. Because Everytime someone shoots me then I shoot back. It always lags and I die first before I can do anything
---
My vote is bring back Survival.
---
I'm allowed to put my opinion on the internet whether you like it or not bud
---
You being toxic back and gonna help mattersüòúüñï
---
The punk look of the later 70's and 80's would not exist. Dying one's hair though has been around for hundreds of years. It was more for higher social status than being a 'rebel' which wasn't a thing until wall after the 50's.  
---
In fact, such hair colors would make one stand out even more, would make that person easier to describe, and ultimately an easier target. Raiders tend to have shitty haircuts and that black makeup look so that instantly brings that stereotype even if he/she isn't one.  
---
I haven't made a new char but the Triangle method used in Fallout 4 is also present in 76. My PC easily meets Minimum specs but doesn't for the Recommended. No character I create will look photo realistic or how I would like down to a certain body structure. I'm not programmer but that might bring up clipping issues with clothing and armor.
---
A few people have camps down for the moment, rebuilding with the new Slocum Joe stuff. I just took down the Smol Mall myself to try something a bit more spread out, since people were only hitting two spots in the Smol and missing the other vendors.  My fault, that.
---
I *wanted* to try out the train car, but I think I'll save that one for a month or two from now, when I build a train station camp again. The current location's not good for it since, you know ‚Ä¶ no rails. :D
---
Should be up and running tomorrow tho!
---
Ive swapped my special so many times its unreal, think I need to start stockpiling random perks
---
Well. Not everyone is going to pay for a service that spits in your face the promise Bethesda made about cosmetics only so....
---
Builder teams FTW. Plus with rad rumble the XP from the ghouls is better with a builder bonus.
---
You are your own team.
---
Whoever said there is No "I" in team didnt get a job working for Bethesda
---
I definitely like these alot more, they focused on more then making things explode
---
Full charge affects FC cost, Power Sprinter affects AP cost
---
That doesn't work if your trying to complete build challenges and they try to claim it while your doing it
---
No!
---
 *I mean, as much as I want PA to make me a god, it has to have some balance over armor besides just not being able to craft or swim.*   
---
What? What kind of balance is there when PA has no option for poison resist?   
---
How is tacking on 50 more poison resist for non PA builds "balance" ?   
---
Really would love to hear your response.
---
25 percent off
---
that's kind of my point. the business model works for one, but not for the other for the very reasons you've stated.
---
Pro tip: make sure people know that your Slocum Joe bots are the vendors if you use them. Some guy angrily messaged me saying he couldn't find me vendors after looking through my camp. He had no idea of the new vendor skin
---
I had this sort of scenario the other day after the sbq, the team i was in engaged with another team, it was really good fun and went on for an hour. I‚Äôd definitely be up for a team pvp event.
---
Good I've been saving up, now at 900 scrip
---
By the end of the year that perk will be useless when w get Perk Loadouts anyway.
---
I just punched two people to death a hour ago lol
---
I was thinking about this earlier today. Picture frames for photos taken, and for notes/maps/ect. Theres definitely some stuff in my note section I'd like to display on a wall.
---
You can't be banned for trap camps. You're good.
---
Especially after all the pilot stuff they just added
---
Edit: oh the bot not the Vertibird
---
That's rough man.
---
I'm like 70% sure that all the new legendary perks with 'enemies explode' is just going to kill the player, especially the melee/unarmed ones lol.  Gonna be funny if I'm right.
---
Lol nice, yeah the kid that punched me from 100 feet away was behind a rock so I knew it was some kind of hack. I was sniping his head and boom I got punched twice with marine and died. If I had actually gotten punched out fairly then that guy would have been a legend
---
What you mean when you see someones camp listed as selling 300 meds you're not hoping to buy 100 rad X, rad away and rad X diluted?
---
Yeah its a huge pain to find. Try posting on the trade sub.
---
I don't build trap camps but if I get caught out by one I laugh and brush it off, it's a game folks don'tnt take life so seriously..
---
To be fair, I'm not asking for photorealism. Simply more control and variety in how we customize our characters.  Although I cannot speak for programmers about clipping with clothing and armor as well, seeing as how certain bodysliders in Fallout 4 have made it possible to alter certain features of the body while also not running into issues of clipping, I believe it is possible, especially considering the difference in manpower and time Bethesda could more easily dedicate this to than a modder.
---
Again, I don't necessarily understand why culture, the punk style, and the raider aesthetic are necessarily relevant points against adding more variety to character customization as I haven't argued for styles that might be unrealistic for the setting. However, there could be more styles added that are more lore friendly. There are a range of 50s hairstyles that Bethesda has not yet explored. And save for a handful, disheveled, wastelander-y hairstyles are in short supply imo.
---
That's never happened to me with 76, but playing minecraft would have my x randomly crash and completely shut down. Just minecraft though.
---
that was damn good!
---
Would be a really cool add-on also weapons displayed with their stats.
---
I've never seen a level 500 and I play every day ...  one player is getting close on xbox, last I saw was liner 480ish, and a good friend of mine is 470.  I can assure you, he's just really good and plays a lot.
---
right.
---
So if i have 3 in End for example , i can raise it to 8 with a perk?
---
Thank you. Glad someone shares this vibe. I feel the same way when someone manages to trick me, why? I‚Äôm lvl 250+ and anything that‚Äôs out of the ordinary with a player interaction break the monotony at a higher level. 
---
As for my trap camp, if someone survives it or is a good sport, they almost always get a spare legendary. 
---
That said, I can‚Äôt tell you how many reports I‚Äôve been messaged about üòë
---
I love running into em
---
Its so cute! I unfortunately can't fit it into either of my camps bc one is a huge restaurant w no budget or floorspace and the other is just a raggedy ass camp.
---
That would require coding and we all know how much Bethesda hates coding.
---
I‚Äôm on PC and have marsupial and adrenal reaction for sale. How much is reasonable to you? Selling for $450 each but can go lower. I‚Äôm at work right now and won‚Äôt be on for at least a couple of hours
---
You can't be banned by Bethesda for it but some trade groups that enforce their own rules will ban you for scamming junk trades using a trap base
---
They were asking you nicely to do the courteous thing, not telling you what to do.
---
Ye some guy with a sob story. Possibly sucidal
---
Also,  I've had a couple 18 kill games with 1400 xp... add in double xp and you can really rack it up.  Once you find a good team you often win 3 or more games in a row a lot
---
"Um, excuse me... Yes, you... Look at me when I'm talking to you... And definitely don't walk away from me when YOU'RE talking to ME..." lol
---
Maybe also where it was picked up? Like "Found on Scorchbeast Queen corpse in XXXXX"
---
Yes, as long as it‚Äôs not one of the new locked plans you get from gold. Those can‚Äôt be sold or dropped.
---
lol is it bad?
---
What would you replace gun fu with?
---
this
---
As if that's even a downside with the amount of repair kits you get from Scorched Earth.
---
I absolutely agree! I currently have a nice house but it just doesn‚Äôt fit with the apocalyptic setting and it bothers me to no end. When I do move again I‚Äôm going to make it as chaotic as possible. There is no reason I should have a two story mansion with a concert hall.
---
I think the issue more comes from the trolling than anything. I've seen people use trap bases to kill players after they spend caps to get valuable junk back and leaver the player cap less. 
---
You won't get banned. But more likely the same this most PvP related features, the trolls will see it get removed.
---
The White version can't be put on SS I think, so it makes sense the other one can't either
---
Yes! That also, like when you get cool stuff from random weak enemies "picked up from 3* legendary ant" lol
---
I mean, I understand the scamming element. Utilizing a vending machine to sell junk and then immediately kill the person taking both the caps and the junk back is definitely straight up fraud lol. 
---
I just need to know where this line is drawn. I‚Äôm not trying to risk getting banned here but damn, let‚Äôs have a little fun with this game.
---
You can't sell plans to vendors without using an exploit
---
I literally rock 1 Agility because I play a medic and hate vats.  Hahahah.  My one perk is Dodgy to make me tankier.
---
Fake progression or the technical term, "horizontal progression" refers to there being no actual gain or increase in gameplay through playing, but you instead gain in other means such as cosmetics, skins, badges, cool avatars, achievements etc. It's things that do not have any effect on the game you are playing at all. You can look it up if you're curious about it more. It's exactly what you are grinding atoms for, cosmetics have zero gameplay changes to what you're playing and are only a visual thing.
---
You mention you only played for atoms now. You're obviously comfortably sitting on some and not short. So I ask you *why* did you quit if you have a stockpile and can still achieve them through just playing like you did before? If you're not spending them then what's the genuine purpose? Is it really fun to just log in and get dopamine from seeing the little bzzzt and +X amount of atoms?
---
You do EXACTLY that but with legendary run levels instead. There is no difference in the gameplay loop you were in is my point and it seems a lot of other players have the same reasoning as you, but I just don't really get it. I would feel like you'd get the same dopamine kick from the season just as much as you would atoms and doing dailies. It's a repeated task that's "braindead" arguably and you have no actual end goal but "I sure hope I see something cool in the atom shop!"
---
You can still choose what you want with atoms. You're not missing anything if you're stockpiling them anyways. If there were back-to-back set releases of things you 100% wanted in the old system you'd be screwed out of luck eventually or need to grind even MORE or need to drop money on it eventually.
---
Again, **the game you played didn't change at all. You still get cosmetics and atoms.** You're burnt it sounds like, just like many other players. It's okay to be burnt but mental gymnastics with "b-bit my atoms" is absurd. It's okay to play how you want, again more power to you, but in your own words you only played for a dopamine kick from atom gaining and hardly spent them.  
---
*Edit:* Just did some quick maffs too and good news! You get 1350 atoms for getting to level 90(not even the max required either.) While this isn't a huge amount compared to before, it sounds like you're sitting on a fair amount of atoms and should be fine considering you don't enjoy everything from the shop. Oh, you also get a TON of other stuff in between like free skins from clothing to weapons, emotes, armor paints, camp objects, perk cards, caps, lunch boxes, scrip, repair kits, bullion, avatars and photo frames.   
---
Unfortunately 1350 atoms is nowhere near 1050 average per month (to your numbers), but a lot of stuff is "paid forward" and it's as if you already spent the atoms. Sure, you may not enjoy all the cosmetics but that's the gimmick with battle pass systems. This one is also **free** mind you and it seems like this is their new way of doing things.   
---
I think it's fair to not want to play anymore after these changes, but be honest with yourself at least. You're sitting on plenty of atoms it sounds like. If the only reason you logged in was to get 35 atoms to buy cosmetics you like when you don't even play the game outside of logging in daily to grind for a bit of atoms, then you're probably finished with the game.
---
Well, each vendor's getting their own lil' house, with signs, so, Hopefully they'll figure it out.
---
Here, however, is where I really, REALLY wish that they'd up the limit on vendors from 4 to 6, or even 8. I have a TON of things to sell and 120 slots ain't enough. Not even CLOSE.
---
I dont know how to describe the music but its loud, and plays whenever you interact with it. But it's cute and looks better than the normal locker with chains and plywood.
---
Google 
---
Looking for clan. 
---
Go there, heaps of clans looking for people to play with.
---
Wow how many other things do I not know about this game?
---
So making a 2nd character with maxed CHR to sell off my stockpile of common duplicate plans and buy ammo making supplies would be a decent idea?
---
I thought you could sell plans you DIDN'T know to a vendor?
---
Wow....
---
maybe I should get out more :)
---
The only way you can sell plans is through a player vendor to another player, you can't sell plans or ammo to an NPC vendor. Hope this helps.
---
Some folks are more than nice enough to go grab ores if you ask them on mic. Most folks choose to defend over grab ores because they cannot trust others to keep the NPCs from dying, but if you can hold off the attacking ghouls and ask people to grab ores they'll go do it. At least I do. It's also best to save topping off the 100 to the last 30 seconds of the event to maximize your exp gain total from it.
---
When was I being toxic? Sorry, but calling you out isn't the same thing as being toxic. Nice try though.
---
Are you PS4? I haven't seen any of the new stuff out and about yet
---
Read the sentence right before the one about FO1st. There's your free option.
---
You said you're adapt modding at this game. So you should know this. However I wouldn't mod this game at all unless you 100% understand what your doing. 
---
A lot of popular item sorting mods and so on had issues that broke the game for everyone and had to be fixed regardless of the fact there shouldn't of been a issue. Hell, right after I Fallout 76 cane out. I actually ran into to a modder on Xbox (both thankfully and unsurprisingly I haven't since). His one shot kill hammer which shot lasers broke a lot of missions in the game. Rendering the loddy pointless. 
---
If you don't know what you're doing. Honestly, don't ask how to sort your code. Just don't do it as all the practice required is most likely going to harm other players.
---
Theres also 2 locks in Mama Dulces. 1 floor safe in the office and one toolbox by the hole in the back wall.
---
Oh great, I didn't know there was such a thing. Yes, lots of diluted Rad-X is available :)
---
Yeah, and if you have a shitty opinion expect that people are going to call you out for it. Freedom of speech doesn't mean people aren't going to think you're a dick if you act like one.
---
Yes, I was just doing the simplest math of 100 x $1.50 if atoms are roughly $1 per 1000.  Naturally, less ranks remaining = less atoms required = less $.  
---
The real point is that Bethesda will be counting on people falling short as we get to the end of the allotted time then spending atoms to finish.
---
Stealthsuit + hotkeyed radaways deals with the radiation completely. Being overencumbered isn't an excuse either. That's what hotkeyed honeys are for.
---
I've got a 2nd character who uses bows and crossbows exclusively and I have a bloodied crossbow.
---
Honestly I think crossbows are pretty poor in comparison to bows but they pretty straightforward to use just dont bother shooting in first person, preferably use vats.
---
You can have some bad moments when theres multiple strong enemies but if your a sneak build this wont be an issue.
---
In terms of which mods just get glow sights and either plasma or flaming (I didn't like explosive)
---
That's much better than the $2100 some serums cost at the vendor, but I'm looking for some other mutations. Thanks though!
---
I have found a few. I dont mind them. One guy was nice enough to give me my junk back.  I usually deposit all my junk now before I go to camps. But I still like finding them to see what people come up with.
---
But they would sell only 1 instead of 2. Bad for Bethesda. Bad for Zenimax. /s
---
Hahaha lol, no I have some mods running after swapping what map I used but the map doesn't work so idk what the fuck is going on, the last map didn't work since the wastelanders update so I got a new one, I believe the last one was causing instability and overlay issues but the new one doesn't fkn work so I'll have to play around with it more, if you fuck games up on pc you can run a repair option which will mostly fix the whole game without having to uninstall completely and reinstall.
---
Blocker is bugged?
---
Lol omg this is great. Now I know you're a troll.
---
Yeah, I used neon letters to spell out "Vendors" on my diner
---
Lol im getting down voted what the actual fuck?
---
PC. The camp was trundling along well over the past few hours, tryng to get the parts to come together, but the servers just shut down. Not sure why ‚Ä¶ they about never go down on a Wednesday, so, SOME kind of update's in the works. Not sure what.
---
When I get back on, I'll try and snag a few screenshots at the least. We don't have the walls sets I need yet, but, we make do as best we can, you know?
---
SCREAMING EAGLES!  
---
If only there was a 1h variant of shovel...
---
With something like this, there is no line. I mean some people feel what I mentioned is fair and in the spirit of the game. Some feel the you have to allow players to be able to survive and even destroy the traps. Though that still negatively effects then when they get a bounty. 
---
However you won't get banned, Bethesda doesn't ban you for it. They just remove the means to do so. Like with group PvP and slap damage. Those people where never ban. They just got a feature removed.
---
I have, it was 15 levels above me and it ran away
---
I encountered my first one after drinking Nukashine because I was bored. I left the area and heard a strange noise and bam, it was behind me.  The second and last time I saw it was when I saw it chasing a level 20 through the area and I chased after them and help him beat it.
---
Yes I‚Äôm on XBox and technically I can guide you through this on the weekends if you live in the European Time Zone. And bloodied weapons deal more dmg the lower your health is
---
No, you're fine someone said most likely.
---
Note to self: Whip up some serums tomorrow morning.
---
Which ones are you looking for? I can make any, but I have no idea what's popular beyond the Marsupial one. Aside from me, *everybody* has that one. I think I'm the only player over level 50 with no mutations, no addictions, not in power armor, and not using Bloody.
---
Yeesh.
---
gonna blow all my scrip on level 1 armor.
---
Best part is; I didn't even need to max out scrip everyday in preparation. I can just keep making and deleting fresh toon.
---
It now only drops as a rare reward from Savage Divide events. In which you get a set of both masks and the jumpsuits available.
---
Mr. Messenger no matter where it spawns counts as one, One Violent Night, Uranium Fever, Someone to talk to, Distinguished guests, Guided meditation. That's it.
---
Savage Divide events. Extremely rare spawn. Good luck.
---
I wish
---
As an Automatic Rifle build, don't turn all of your acid into Lemonade for the AP bonus, as you'll eventually need more gunpowder or the means to refine all that lead from Lucky Hole.
---
That's the price of going solo.
---
We cant??? That's a huge drawback if I cant use my new Glow in the dark stars wallpaper.
---
Have fun with the reputation grind!
---
Might be a stupid question, but do these require ground placement or can they be stacked/put on ground/2nd floors?
---
At least two in Monogah.  Wall safe in a store on the south east corner.  A safe in a guard post on north westen side.  Once I got the perk and started looking for them a few months ago, I started seeing them all over the place.
---
I can be solo and start a public team and be the only one in it and get the +2 to all stats.
---
And how much budget space is it?
---
One thing to note... you can do both settlers and raider quest lines until you have to side with one. This is the last quest and it is called ‚Äúsiding with raiders/ settlers. 
---
Make sure you do the settlers quest line to get the Chinese stealth armor, then you can side with the raiders for max rep for them. The gauss minigun is the best weapon of the new releases, but the ammo is v expensive
---
Thx for a list of events to prioritize
---
To get +3 you need one other person in team to trigger Strange in Numbers.
---
Please stop assuming it's the same team that does coding / design / storywriting / quests / everything else!
---
I'm being friendly here but I don't know how to say this kindly without being blunt.
---
I'm fully aware of running  repair options and so on PC. I whole point was you broking your experience but other people's. You sound like you  have no idea what a badly coded mod can do and the time that goes into making client side mods what doesn't end up breaking stuff for other people. You for asking a community of people who have to deal with that damage on top of the game being broken to help you work out how to sort code. Their not going too people if you don't know that and reply with generic PC player info everyone knows about at this subject then that less if a reason too.
---
Any way pretty sure you're just changing lighting or textures or something along those lines. If your mod isn't working. Why not try want you can download online.
---
RIP camp budget.
---
Looks great though, man!
---
cushioned mods dont stack, and even having one negates so little fall damage that it isnt worth having.
---
I love my power armor build but no way gonna wear power armor anymore if this is true.  It would be stupid too.
---
Yeah, sit the 3d modeler down to fix critical bugs! That'll teach them! 
---
...thinking about it maybe that's why we have all the bugs?! √≥√í
---
This post could literally save my dualshock from being thrown at the tv
---
make sure you're using the vox syringer and not a generic one. then dump all damage perk cards
---
I think these developers look like those strange creatures we see who have tried to enter and leave power armor and became deformed with spindly legs, they find it hard to use a keyboard, those poor loves üò¢
---
I just actually ran into one a few minutes ago, didn‚Äôt fight t though. Didn‚Äôt know they were even that rare
---
Yes they need. They need too much. Need.
---
If you play Morgantown, try the Pioneer Scouts camp, two there. Also in the North/West corner of the Penitentiary there's a safe in the building.  
---
The safes on [this map](https://i.imgur.com/LUXoUDu.jpg) are the same locations in NW.
---
There's quite a few knew quests, events and so on. Wastelanders came out adding NPCs and a new main quest line. A hell of a lot if bug fixes though if I'm honest its only less broken than before not fixed.
---
Melee weapons are still actually top tier for min/max damage out put so you don't need to change your build. But you might want a better weapon anyway. 
---
If you're thinking of trying the  game again. Try it, see if you like it. No harm either way.
---
I‚Äôm on us but since I have a bad sleep schedule I can get on what you want
---
We have audio loop bug fixes like for the Tesla rifle reload bug. There are high definition texture packs in the works to give things 2, 4, and 8k textures. The 10mm sub has a reflex sight mod for PC. Better inventory is an insanely useful tool to check your weight under any particular tab or to check which items weigh how much total (they even added a keyring recently to clean up the Misc tab like people keep asking Bethesda for). There‚Äôs a mod to show the exact cost and usage meters for items under your Camp budget. There‚Äôs a mod that makes Nuke Zones quieter. Even before Bethesda added the ability to see which plans were known or not, PC had a mod which worked even better than the ones Bethesda built. We also had the save everything mod before they added the protections for favorites items, and to this day it still has more protections than 76 provides. We have a text chat mod so PC players can communicate since Bethesda won‚Äôt fix it. For a long time, SFE helped fix the bug that caused Strangler Heart Power Armor to lock up the game. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the Perk Loadout Manager.
---
Sure we could ‚Äúplay the game‚Äù but modded 76 is VASTLY superior to vanilla
---
Aw, ok. I'm PS4. I'll keep an out for the screen shots
---
What weapon would you recommend I think it was the all rise I used
---
Depends. Yes in the sense you now have two characters who potentially could get one. No in that if you only play one character, you wouldn't be finding one on the other.
---
that's the private servers that everyone wanted, unfortunately we just get a private version on the same trash Amazon servers that host the public ones. I was hoping the modding community would have found some way to force it to personal hardware servers but guess not.
---
You can do that in one day  with all the xp buffs right now.
---
You have a 0% chance to get the fixed until you learn the fixer plans
---
at that rate you will get banned for hacking end game content
---
That‚Äôs what I heard from on another post. Haven‚Äôt tested it myself
---
If the formula found [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Perfectly_preserved_pie_(Fallout_76)) is accurate, then the odds of that happening a pretty low. Especially considering the first attempt is the lowest chance. It's all dependant on your Luck, but even with Luck of 20, it'd still be a 4% chance on the first go.
---
It‚Äôs been happening to my friend and I as well- we‚Äôve gotten 6 between the two of us all in watoga since the weekend
---
Not likely. Like other effects that affect your special you won't be able to add more cards than your base special stat
---
i got one at the purveyor and another one a day later at another maschine
---
those were the first i ever got... maybe better chanced rng now?
---
Just ignore them. Trap camps aren‚Äôt bannable
---
I believe its only the slots.
---
Is this pc or Super Nintendo?
---
Mama dulces has 2, a safe in the office, a toolbox by the back wall hole.
---
Its very strange but kinda cool at the same time
---
And?
---
No, not really. You just won‚Äôt also be rolling for anything you‚Äôve learned or picked up in Wastelanders as well. If your character doesn‚Äôt know those plans, then there is no difference. 
---
And since you‚Äôd usually roll for ranged, the only ones that effect this are:
---
Plasma Caster
---
Gauss Minigun
---
Gauss Shotgun
---
Gauss Pistol
---
Bow
---
Compound Bow
---
Depends on your play style if I'm honest. But for damage I like faster swing speed and bloodied. Bloodied is actually quite versatile so you don't need to be a bloodied build to make use out of it.
---
The actually weapon is less important these days but I think Gorgnaks Axe is best.
---
I don't have any bloodied melee weapons but if your on Xbox I might have something you can use till you get something you like.
---
Wait the game has gotten out of beta?
---
I should go buy a lotto ticket just incase is what you're saying right?
---
That's how I feel about my bloodied explosive cryolator... her name is Fionna and she kicks booty!
---
One of my friends made a trap camp because he was bored and he always lets people have their junk back - the other day it was so funny because this guy came back over and over and messaged him like ‚Äúyour camp is fascinating!!‚Äù XD he was so excited and even ended up trading with us. It‚Äôs all in good fun sometimes
---
He started at the black hole thing, and he is moving like 1 space a day. Relax. You'll be fine.
---
Yeah that's quite possible with the recent update and all
---
(runs away)
---
I get so many camps where I‚Äôm like &gt;_&gt; this is a trap.. it has to be.... I‚Äôm going in anyway!!!
---
ps4?
---
thats the problem, i dont know to be honest. therr are no other damage perks in AGI, perhaps i'll go with thru hiker 3 and marathoner 2 bc i sprint quite a lot. to equalize the loss of damage, i could swap inspriational from CHA with tenderizer. but thinking over it now i think i will just take the loss of damage and take the QOL (quality of life) perks. hopefully they hotfix it soon....
---
Yes, just finally got in again
---
Yeah Ive heard of people soloing it, but I think I've died to ghouls more than anything else in this game
---
Yes on PS4.
---
Don't some of the workshops have pads you can repair and use? Seems like it'd be pretty easy to implement
---
I don't think it's quite that good. Maybe enter a small raffle or something instead.
---
It really is. I'm trying to figure out what causes it but I'm guessing it isn't anything I can do myself to stop it from happening.
---
Also, imagine my heart skipping a beat when it popped up the first time saying "Rank S.C.O.R.E 1/100" in the middle of the screen, thought I lost all my progress all of a sudden.
---
Just saying it'll probably be used by bloodies since it looks to be the most useful. I mean +5 more strength will definitely help
---
Ok but I can‚Äôt promise that I‚Äôm going online when you are still awake. Srry
---
Welcome to fo76, Reddit‚Äôs Premium Fallout 76 circlejerk with a wide range of toxicity over just about everything. To answer your question though, check for Cloudy01 Fallout 76 Mod Manager on Nexus, then drop all the .ba2 files into the Data folder. Launch Cloudy01 and it will edit your .ini for you
---
oh lol, there is another ship on the board? didnt even recognize it :D
---
Wait I thought waiting at load screens was how you played NW? Am I doing something wrong?
---
When it gets like that for me, I first check my network connection and then reopen the game and if that doesn't work I restart my ps4. Not sure why that works but usually helps.
---
Is the spawn glitch still working? It stopped working for me about two days ago. The tent placement that had worked for me before just started causing the scorched to spawn at other points.
---
Well strength only helps a bloodied melee build. A commando would go for perception, for example. I think any build would benefit from this
---
Hahahaha, I think I'll try save my luck for the Purveyor
---
They didn't "sell" anything. It's a free item. Trust people that dont actually play the game to leave nasty comments üôÑ
---
I can't even find myself a clean uniform.
---
This man thinks!
---
I‚Äôve never seen one either in nw I‚Äôve locked computers but that‚Äôs it
---
I'm guessing it moves out in front of us, as we are supposed to be chasing it, maybe you can only catch him if you finish?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs good
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on Xbox but I like just killing shit as fast as I can
---
In Flatwoods there is an area with three locked crates. It where the greenhouses are that have those farm Mr. Handys in adventure mode. Lockpicks are infinite as well, you do not need to find them
---
He moves 1 space I day I believe. So you could probably catch it if you try.
---
I saw one for sale yesterday for 400 caps... dang!
---
Thanks mate. üëçüèª
---
Plus karma to ya.
---
Where is it near?
---
That camp budget % mod... I am unable to find it on nexus. What is it called?
---
Np.  Two of the locked crates are the green fertilizer holder things in the greenhouses.
---
Trying it -- wonder if it is due to the PS4 waking from sleep and having like a messed up internet that nuclear winter doesn't like??
---
look for safes. there's one inside the wrecked plane at the Morgantown airport. you only need the lockpick perk
---
Something like IntRaw. The original is defunct[IntRaw Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/513)
---
The Vault Tech Agricultural Research Center on the map I believe
---
Thank you so much!
---
I honestly thought it did. Was disappointed to see its separate ones. It makes the free version much better imo.
---
No problem
---
Kinda realizing that there will be a glitch involving all the these perks :/
---
A bloodied build is what you want then. I don't have any bloodied melee weapons but there no hard to find these days.
---
I recommend going to peoples camps and see if you can find one you like. Even just a bloodied super sledge will increase your damage by a lot.
---
are those pies worthy? got two from the top of west tek
---
How so? And we are talking about bugthesda. I'm sure we will get a thousand new glitches üòÖüòÖ
---
Ok here's how it works:
---
You unlock "slots" at certain levels. These are 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300. There's therefore a max of 6 slots. These slots are completely seperate from your "normal" perks.
---
When you choose an empty slot, you're presented with all the legendary perks to choose from. Once you pick one it becomes locked to that slot - you cant freely move them around.
---
All the legendary perks start at their rank 1 version.
---
You can choose to scrap normal perks for coins, so if you have some duplicates, or some you know you will never use, get rid of them for coins.
---
You can spend coins to rank up a legendary perk - its 100 coins to go from rank 1 to rank 2.
---
If you really have changed your mind, you can pay 1 coin to unequip a legendary perk to free up the slot.
---
Alright what‚Äôs your Xbox gamertag? I‚Äôll add you and we can play when my game gets done
---
Yes and I'm also talking about exploits
---
For me, the team aspect is the game.  Playing with long time friends or hooking up with strangers of all levels and play styles.  I love the tension that there could be a more cohesive squad about to smash you from out of nowhere.  I'm not great at it but it's fun to play.
---
However, it might be interesting to have an alternative mode.  I think it could completely change the dynamic.  You'd definitely get some cheaters forming unofficial squads. That would be difficult to police.
---
DrUnknownShot. I'll help you get your build sorted find get you something better than all rise.
---
You I can bet that will be a thing too
---
look up "ps4 data cache"... i had constant load issues and Disconnection, errors, "rebuilding" helped. I also deleted old gamess to free up space (seemed to help)
---
Beginning midnight? Of what time zone?
---
 **Nuclear Proliferator** \- generate 1/1/1/2 lightweight mininuke every 60/50/40/40 minutes. Up to a max of 3/4/5/5. 
---
You can't give the things away, and now you can make even more of them. I hate it when I get them as a reward and don't realize it, then wonder why I'm overweight, then realize you carrying dead weight.  Sure they weigh less,but using them is worthless unless they plan to up the damage on them.
---
I do like some of them though like  **Master Infiltrator,** **Antivenom,** **Legendary Ability** , **are must haves IMO.If you like running with a team this may well be one to have slotted**  **Blood sacrafice** 
---
The rest for me is taking it or leave it kind of deal, unless it's tailored to your build. I really hope with this update there is also at least a way to remove perk cards, so I can swap them out with animated versions I finally unlocked unless they are doing away with those. That and less clutter means less time sifting through repeats.
---
Now,  this is just my thoughts,I'm fine if people disagree still wish a total perk revamp was coming sooner rather then later, so tired of forgetting to swap out cards and dying or selling stuff for less etc.
---
How will you fix unbalanced builds? Also what happens if the team leader changes the team focus from events to PVP?
---
This could work if they somehow implemented 2 different damage systems at the same time - vs. NPCs it's the normal system, vs. players you get stripped of your perks/mutations and have NW weapon damage and armor rating. 
---
This will be impossible for some perks, so maybe a second PVP perk tree with the NW perks is neede, but it will still not solve conflicts for all perks. Maybe it has to be tied to joining a PVP-team, that's when the tree switches and  mutations get disabled. Also it needs to be only be possible to found an new or join an existing PVP-team, on switch to pvp all other players get bootet from the team. Something like that.
---
So a LOT of work and many new bugs for an unpopular game mode...
---
Riff Raff? (The Rocky Horror one, not the rapper)
---
So you're telling me I scarpped/sold a rare item
---
the game is rigged from the start
---
They arnt worth anything, I just think it's cool to hold onto the ones I get out of the machines due to how often you can get them from them
---
2 locks in mama dulces. One floor safe in the office, one toolbox by the hooe in the wall by the back door
---
I got a meteorite sword from the Breach and Clear event. Sold it cause its stats sucked and it took up unnecessary space in my stash. Is there something special about it that I don‚Äôt know?
---
Ke?
---
The bloodied crossbow is awesome.  Awesome Damage, good range, VATS accuracy and VATS cost.  Get the explosive frame and go have fun.  You don't need any other mod for it.  You just apply the explosive frame as a mod and then use the same bolts that you've always used.  The frame makes them explosive.  Demo Expert works with the explosive frame.
---
Tell my inventory that food, clean water, and medicine aren't readily available. For regular old wanderers, raiders, and settlers sure, but us vault dwellers are a different breed.
---
It is.  He is in my dust actually.
---
Not actually rare, I get one almost every time I do Breach and Clear.
---
Does anyone know if a saved character from playing on Steam would transfer over to the gamepass PC version? Will the windows store still look at the fallout 76 folder in documents for savegames .ini file etc?
---
For those like myself who've been hitting the grind since day one with NW it has left a deep impression on us. We still challenge most kills (especially snipes from half way across a map one shot to the head). My target was once to win overseer to just getting top ten for placement score.
---
However I must admit the other night my crew and I won 3 games during our session with very little oddities. We've also noticed a flood of new players and maps at capacity more often.
---
I really *really* enjoy NW. I've played many PvP games over the years spanning back to unreal 2004, battlefield 2, etc... And this game mode is one of the most tactical and exciting PvP games I've played in a long time. I hope more modes like waypoint capture or big 25v25 type stuff comes out in the future. 
---
Glad to hear this is being worked out.
---
I loved Fallout 1 and it's desolate barren desertscape setting with barely anything left, but you got to admit that would be really boring in a first-person game. Sometimes in video games some concessions have to be made in the direction of fantasy vs realism in the interest of keeping them visually appealing and interesting
---
It is explained in the rules.  He moves every time his fuel is replenished.
---
Thanks for the tip. I‚Äôm just going to bed. Not worth it anymore to find 3 locks to pick. This is by far the stupidest challenge
---
Loads of times. Even took pics . Before and After.
---
There are locked containers scattered around. They aren't random so if you know where one is in the main game, it should still be there in NW. You need the lockpicking perk on, but you don't need any bobby pins.
---
You would need the server code to do that. The client on your PC doesn't have all the parts to run the game.
---
Well, the SPECIAL legendary perks are discutable, I think it will render the most OP builds (that can pump their SPECIAL in the 40s or so) even more OP, and will even more break any balance there may yet be in this game. How, for example, can you regulate some systems based on XP, when there is a disparity between builds so large ? XP being multiplied by a factor based on your INT, you may have already a factor of difference of x4 XP, on killing mobs, between a standard build and the most OP build. 
---
Flame and poison are situational, at best, the number of times I died from poison must have been 1 (and I wasn't paying attention), fire 0. You already have fire proof normal perk card. They're tied to a matching set of armor (why ?), All in all they don't feel legendary, they could as well have been added to the normal pool, and no one would equip them.
---
Cleave is even more situational, I'm melee, and the number of time I have mobs grouped in a way that cleave would be useful is so low, I wouldn't waste a legendary perk on that. In my usual confrontations, outside of some melee mobs that may aggregate around you, they all shoot from afar, separated from one other.
---
And with the cost of the perk points, you will be able to level very few legendary perks, don't count on having many above level 1.
---
Has no one mentioned Canned Beef Stew? You get 5 for completing Feed the People, 5% XP boost for an hour. 
---
I have like 70 stacked right now, use about 5 a day if I‚Äôm on long enough, and within that time I usually end up doing FtP atleast twice.
---
They do stack, it's just that there is diminishing returns and no way to pass 90% negation, even with 2 pieces and goat legs
---
If I'm correct the only way to truly negate fall damage is with two acrobatic pieces as they work differently
---
Please stop telling others what to do and write on their time
---
 You‚Äôll most likely spawn into Morgantown, so go to adventure mode first and find these safes to know their location in NW. Fast travel to Monongah power plant and head to the East if it. There you‚Äôll find a small red shack with a safe in it. Now head towards Monongah and look for a gas station/convenience store East in town. There‚Äôs a wall safe in the store. From here, head out the front door and down the street until you see a rundown trailer with a lookout built on top. There‚Äôs a safe inside the trailer. Once you have these locations down, just run from one to the other in NW quickly and you can get them all in one go
---
Melee is totally viable. Junkie/bloodied is considered the greatest damage at the moment but i run a high damage unarmed build and can one hit pretty much anything except the queen. As well as can tank pretty much anything except assaultron death lasers.
---
Signed.
---
Don't care which corner, it just needs to shrink and move.
---
The Legendary pop up, however, can be disabled all together. What's that? Another Rolling Pin? Nocturnal you say? Noice, insta drop.
---
WTF are we going to do with 200 posion resist?
---
Ancient news. This challenge used to be for atoms a long time ago
---
Secret Service armor isn't power armor. Unless you're referring to the T-65?
---
yes, give that NE area trenches and some orange fog. I wandered about there (there's an empty patch (right under the southern-point of the map "compass" (upper right corner of map) that plays the settlement/workshop music, even though there's nothing there.
---
Thought it might be the new Dev-room placement (underground), but who knows.
---
well that sucks
---
25% off, so a 3-star weapon would cost 75 scrip instead of 100
---
No. You can Respec points after level 50
---
Stabilizer is the reason I have interred myself into my X-01. Even in death, I still serve.
---
At the end I placed it at Whitespring golf curse because the flat area with the little pond is perfect to make big builds. By the BBQ location are some trees that doesn't go away when I try to build something sadly...
---
Thanks, wasn‚Äôt aware of this!
---
Interesting idea.  They could do a lot with mods such as these.  Possibly use the chem buffs as a framework for underarmor mods.
---
I have half a dozen corn on the dirt tiles inside a locked room just for me, but then I have bulk outside for anyone to take... this guy is just a jerk. I hope your son continues to play the game and has fun.
---
I can't think of any, but they did remove several weapons and an entire legendary perk.  One weapon they tried to nerf by making it weigh like 500lbs and do like 1dmg, but people were still hoarding it so they eventually removed it IIRC.
---
You‚Äôre not getting banned for a trap base. People are just cry babies that like to harass anyone who kills them. Send the next one a message ‚Äúthanks for using wasteland junk removal services‚Äù.
---
They removed the perk including the items people already had with that perk?
---
And any chance you can remember the name of that weapon?
---
Hell yeah, will make my derelicte raider main happy.
---
Oh yeah, has been for a year and a half! Yet many betas have less bugs.
---
I‚Äôve always had this stance, and it, among many other issues always put me off. I have over a thousand hours in fallout 4 and picked up fallout 76 a little under a week ago. I‚Äôve already sunk 40 hours in with many more to come. It‚Äôs a different experience for sure but once you come to terms with that and Bethesdas long dry dick has numbed ur asshole from all the micro transaction bs it‚Äôs actually quite enjoyable :)
---
It depends on your play style,as it comes auto equipped with a silencer,just need the other stats for your build.It pairs really well with the Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
The Fixer is a customized combat rifle. It also possesses a unique bonus to stealth and movement speed while sneaking, even on a non-legendary version.
---
I run mine with single shot mod as,as my build is full stealth,but I really need a bloodied version,but for now it's Anti Armor.It's better then nothing.I run that with my bloodied bow,but the bow pretty much one shots everything,and I can kill a scorched beats with 3-4 shots.
---
But the Fixer can be used without stealth,but you will need to tailor the build for it,but it really shines for stealth builds with the right stats and perks.
---
Did you get it as a reward or did someone drop it,as you only can get it from the Purveyor if you know the plan,or someone drops it/sells it,and the one off events will sometimes offer it like the Parade as it dropped stuff from the Purveyor.
---
In the end The Handmade and Fixer are two of the best you can get in game,but I think for out right combat the Handmade wins outs,but for stealth/sneak giving the silencer and sneak bonuses the Fixer gives as just base stats,it gets the edge for stealth.
---
I consider this entirely possible!
---
I'm not sure they hate power armour considering how many models, skins and model-swap (the riders, liberty prime, commie, Red Ranger...) they put in the game.
---
They sure ain't interested on expanding it gameplay wise though.
---
RIP Strangler Heart
---
Yes, the Double ammo capacity weapons.
---
Saves are stored server side and you have to login to your Beth account anyways, so I don't see why not. It's how it worked when the game came to Steam and people started using that instead of the Beth launcher. 
---
The only things that won't transfer over are, most likely, Atoms and atom store items you purchased before the switch because those are tied to the launcher you are playing on.
---
They are still used and traded regularly, so they don't fit the criteria.
---
Thanks anyway
---
I haven't had much of a chance to do that event,seems like every time I join randoms it fails,though I'm a bloodied stealth build so not sure if that is a plus or not for that event.
---
Looks like you're good for farming the plans for a spell,it looks like a fun even with the right team.
---
The caps mine was yanked from our list of craftable items.
---
Interesting, but that is a consumable rather than equipment really
---
Same, trying to restart the game and hope that works.
---
True. I had forgotten about that happening til I saw your post.
---
Not resources, budget. If you're doubling your wall count you'll have less space in you camp budget for other things. It does look better but just be aware.
---
I lost a full set of SH and my BE90 laser rifle.
---
Hit me up with some chems fam!
---
I've been scrapping them or giving them to new players. I hold onto 5 on my alt. Can get them if you do breach and clear. Still pretty cool little weapon to collect.
---
In 4 spaces away. I'll be passed him by the end of this week.
---
Also don't be in stealth.
---
Thanks for making my day better by saving me hours of time I would have wasted in nuclear winter.
---
Better - before you move, remove the wiring from the vending machine and snap something to it (I place the small letters eg "Ammo" on one side)
---
Drag the vending machine (with the ammo sign stuck to it) out in your yard by itself. Do this with each individual machine, making sure they're not on a foundation or attached to anything else.
---
Can also do this with bobblehead stands, display cases, magazine racks, etc. 
---
Then when you move, they will be individual blueprints that are much easier to place than even a small building. you can safely scrap any buildings that don't work without losing your decor. 
---
Takes only a few moments to do really.
---
Why would you even need/want that...do you store the other 100%?
---
I‚Äôm experiencing the same thing.
---
I have m at 85 caps.. they sell before i blink my eyes
---
They've got this monthly subscription where you can farm in peace without a soul around to bother you.
---
Your chances are just as bad, but you‚Äôll have more rolls if you‚Äôre scripping on both daily.
---
I just find it weird that the only piece of equipment that was nerfed retroactively rather than being made into a legacy was one that would've negatively impacted Atom Store sales due to it filling a cosmetic slot and not able to have skins applied to it. *Everything* else was left in but removed from possible drops/rewards from that point onwards. Just an interesting observation..
---
They could stop doing everything and work on fixing this game and it would still be buggy.Look I hate bugs and they are annoying as crap. What I hate even more though is a buggy game with no decent content. 
---
You either have to accept bugs exist and will exist, or move on from this game as they could stop everything and work on bugs and they will still exist and all you will end up with is a less buggy game with no new content.
---
The game engine is the biggest hurdle with stomping out bugs, as it seems to create just as many as it fixes, and sometimes bugs they fix to come back.
---
Last I highly doubt they listen to most feedback or complaints about the game as if they did a lot of QOL stuff would of been done by [now. ](https://now.As)[As](https://now.As) people since BETA have been begging to fix fast travel issues, along with a better perks system with load-outs.Yet it wasn't really dealt with until now and slated for the end of the year.
---
I think the push IMO right now should be a huge push for QOL changes and no more new content,but then people will complain there is nothing to [do.So](https://do.So) they must try and balance the two and in the end both sides still whine about [it.So](https://it.So) no matter what side they chose someone will be moaning about it.
---
I don‚Äôt want to rain on your parade too much, but that sword isn‚Äôt all that rare. It can be obtained from Breach and Clear or Lode Baring events. I do Breach and Clear pretty often and I generally just drop the sword now. If I sell it it‚Äôs usually 250 caps. 
---
But yes it‚Äôs a cool looking sword!!
---
Same, XP bonus is awesome,most people team and still solo  anyway :-)
---
I've done a trap camp once where you'd have to do some math to open each area on the keypad. The trap however was me. The final equation when put into the keycode would kill me. Good times.
---
I have done it ten times over the last week and a half, every other run there is nothing (except an occasional meteoric sword) in any container. Even gave it over 24 hours to refresh and still nothing on this last run.
---
No. It‚Äôs not rare.
---
If you have flux, I'll make them for you.
---
I was on a break from the game when everyone was excited about it. Perhaps it had to do with methods being used to reroll attempts. IIRC there was a method being used at the time.
---
No. It‚Äôs not rare. You‚Äôre good.
---
scorchbeast, the hermit crap version. very nice :)
---
Wow you're even luckier than I was doing fasnacht 300 times and getting 2 rare masks, thats amazing
---
Someone mind explaining what's going on? Are the nametags floating above that floating camp leeching the event or something?
---
There isn't enough of a player pool to support this. On pc I see the same names every other game. If you start splitting that in half, you'd have less people per game and longer lobby times. I anticipate that will change as the game is available on gamer pass and they seemed to have successfully squashed NW exploiting. I also hope for some variation in NW.
---
He just wans to be like all the other hermit crabs, he doesn't know he's a bat...aww bless him :-)
---
You don‚Äôt have to though, you don‚Äôt need to complete every single challenge, every single day. There are plenty of options to get score in adventure, the NW challenges are just a bonus IMO.
---
I think they're under "misc" on the vendor list
---
Meh. I consider it 1 skin and 1 "change it a little so they dont think I copied your homework" skin
---
To the people who said the gold bullion from the legendary run is like nothing: I think I get it now.
---
It's amazing when this happens. Radiation rumble is an XP dream. Don't even have to succeed at the event; just kill the damn ghouls for the xp! When I start hearing around week 9 why players couldn't finish the game board, I'll be sure to reference posts like this. You got to freakin play the game!
---
Oh, that is not the worse version though, the worse is when there are no map icons to fast travel and you have to quit the game.
---
I find the best way to avoid most fast travel bugs is don't click on the icon fast,and don't go to an event you might die easily and go overweight due to armor/mutations not working upon death.
---
So when I want to go to the Queen or whatnot,I make sure even upon death I won't be overweight if armor/mutations allow me to carry more, as they tend to bug out.
---
About 16, the ammo converter took the wind out my sails....fucking thing :-)
---
Damn I hit level 111 yesterday. Looks like have a lot more to go
---
I could be wrong,  but when people stand on top of tents / on the fences it can stop the queen from landing, making the event lots harder
---
Fuck the brotherhood
---
All they needed to do was implement a checkpoint after a certain objective was flagged as 'complete' and it was in a private interior so it wouldn't have been hard. And tbh if bad coding gave them cause to entirely remove items they saw as "unbalanced" from the game and from inventories, the hacked item problem would be solved in a heartbeat.
---
Frees up display asset slots? Who knows?
---
Doing stuff like that is always a two way road. If you can add custom imagery into the game... Expect vore hentai rule 34 on someone's walls the next day.
---
Not that crap, he's trying :-)
---
There are a number of places you can find a pick lock. Morgan town biv location has one. No one ever goes there. The airplane hanger at the cat house has one. There are a few guides I've seen pop up that have others.
---

---
*That said this list is an improvement...*
---
What do you mean that the halloween rewards stack and the winter do not?
---
Free spirit would unfortunately be unusable. 10% isn't enough of a damage reduction to justify wearing it instead of retaining your damage resistance, and returning 10% of ranged damage back is useless for the same reasons that ricochet's useless.  
---
Metal soldier would also be unusable for two different reasons. For starters, per and agi are arguably the worst special effects for power armor users, and objectively the worst for heavy gunners. If you removed the 10% buff and instead gave a buff of +3 or +4 STR and +3 or +4 end (I say endurance as a placeholder, any special stat other than perception would be fine, but endurance is pretty optimal and makes more sense to me anyway) And the second reason relates to the damage buff: a 10% buff to heavy weapon damage would be an obscene buff to those weapons in general. Commandos are (SOMEWHAT) balanced because they're essentially glass cannons in pve, and a heavy gunner in power armor with an additional 10% damage boost would be an incredibly sturdy cannon by comparison.  
---
High maintenance would essentially just be a flat buff to junkies and high health builds. Raising the cap to 95% would make it more balanced.  
---
And specialist would be nice enough ig, but i really don't see the point of it. Boosting zealots would turn queen fights into even more of a joke, boosting ghoul slayer would turn the new wendigo colossus event into a joke, and the rest wouldn't increase the use of weapons with those effects. I might consider picking up a mutant slayer gun just for running west tek, but outside of that there's no real point to it.
---
I think he moves 1 space a day? So you should catch him.
---
üèÖ The poor mans award, just for you
---
I play primarily solo but team up for XP off mic. I've played 90% solo since beta and I'm level 411 and have tons of good equipment. Mind you being part of communities marketplaces and the likes outside of the game helps but in the game is mostly just me running around.
---
Hypocrite
---
I am so hurt lol
---
No new player is playing NW. Most regular players don't. Dont kid yourself. Do you want me to log in to pick a lock again badass?!?
---
What?
---
Yeah. I bet you have a ton of great opinions.
---
I was in no rush for any one thing. I maxed affinity with raiders and settlers and bought out all of their plans with gold. Now I am going to focus on v79 plans and just buy what seems fun at the time. I did some math and without buying gold at wayward it'll take me just under 200 days to get enough gold to buy all of 79s stuff. Shorter if there is any event that gives gold and I keep buying from wayward.
---
I‚Äôm at the gun skin can‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs 20 something
---
Radiation has finally made Lizzy one with the Magic School Bus! Praise Atom!
---
Lime a list of outfit that's rare. Is the urban scout mask rare
---
He wants a list of all the rare clothing in the game so he can know what to get rid of
---
Ups Sorry. My goal is to survive, me vs 49 is one thing me vs 46 is another.
---
There is a bit better one too, that allows ini tweeking. 
---
Quick configuration is the name.
---
I read on the Bethesda pts forums yesterday that bethesda are now giving the same points for gold cards as they are for standard cards. I'll have a hunt around for the link to the forum once I'm at my laptop, as I'm on mobile at the moment
---
I tried to put mine on the roof of my shop and it didn't work. It's got a concrete foundation so it needs to be in ground I think. Not sure if other foundation pieces snap to it.
---
No it‚Äôs not, I don‚Äôt think people really buy plasma guns
---
It is now, sell for 20 to 30k caps at times
---
Ok cool so I‚Äôm not crazy lmao
---
I still use Cloudy01 since it‚Äôs simple enough and I can manually flip on or off specific mods to test what breaks and what works instead of bundling everything into one
---
Neat
---
Yeah I do. Wanna read them? This was never about my opinions about the game
---
Let me preface this.  I have been hardcore grinding since a few days after the start in which I took a break from the game before starting.  I have also won an international leveling competition once before in a different game.  The amount I have been grinding is easily an extreme example of focus broken only by eating, sleep, working out, and video calls from the SO.    
---
I am level 95.  No Godmode.  Sheer grind and character level 638 now.
---
Bingo
---
The big plasma gun?
---
Nah, I think I can tell.  From the solid 200 karma lmfao
---
Gatling plasma?
---
Maybe they just finished a SBQ run and are restocking. Or they just did a lead run. Who knows. You're getting the bonus. Just choose a new server. Don't be salty.
---
yes but unless something changed its still freaking expensive to level up
---
Yeah sorry didn‚Äôt know what it was called
---
Nice job. I managed to complete the grind in 2 days from 0 xp to 8500 (not on 2xp) (God help me) I can agree that it is indeed soul crushing and I never want to play nw again lol
---
I got a bos soldier suite and jump suit are they work anything
---
It‚Äôs crazy how basically no one has posted about it.  It has to be unintentional, right?
---
Ohh because of a virtual check of perfect strangers about my account is relevant... Good for u.
---
I thought you meant the plasma hand gun. You might be able to find someone with a fixer plan on the forbidden sub
---
31
---
Thabks good to know. I prefer a more vertical camp so I guess I wont be buying it. Just to be safe though, would you mind checking to see if it have a baseless variant like the Greenhouse dome?
---
I‚Äôm kinda in awe that they actually listened
---
11.  
---
I am happy and sad right now how the seasons turned out.  
---
Sad 
---
\- ammo converter - what the hell ? I d rather farm all the mats than use this abomination :D
---
\- auto completed daily challanges - happens to me 3 times  
---
\- Who the hell thought that building 10x something in your camp is fun :)
---
Happy
---
I freed myself from the scrip mania with 5 characters and finished daily rep grind on my 2 main characters, so I am happy I do not have to log more than once a day with one char to do the challanges.  
---
One more season and I ll be freed from Appalachia :D
---
get a weapon that is close to your level, check which perks to use to make said weapon stronger. 
---
Nukes and Dragons is a good site to help decide which perk cards to use while you level. You can essentially plan out your leveling perks beforehand: 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Yes, but you can‚Äôt wear Armor if you use it.
---
obv, and stop assuming that devs take decissions of what to do or not.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs to stop duping of god rolled weapons, Hopefully the load outs update will let you make multiple useful builds for different weapons.
---
You messed your number up.  Can't have it and a period right after.
---
I've seen they work only when in range of a repaired vertibot platform like the one in poseidon power plant or converted munitions factory
---
Reminds me of Destiny which gives a huge pop-up on the screen with a flash whenever you ranked up, even while playing pvp
---
Yeah. Fixer plans are going for 5-10k now. I'd think you could get one for that gun.
---
I don't think it does. 
---
You can preview it by highlighting it in build mode and moving the shadow around (even if you didn't buy it, the current atom shop items will be in there). If it has a variant there will be an arrow next to it (that's how it is for the greenhouse dome) for the other one.
---
That would be sweet, but I'm kot holding my breath on them doing anything useful with the perk cards at the putrid attempt at legendary cards
---
Yeah someone just offered me one before and i didnt know if it was worth it
---
The jump suit is quite rare the soldier suit is not
---
Why not just have someone come with you?
---
New Elder paint colour scheme is like paladin but looks newer n shinier
---
Bethesda always served the **most basic version** of all the stuff. Sometime it seems that they have not even seen the game they had created. Like they do not have any imagination.  
---
Community of moders always add the flavour to the bethesda games.
---
Your Camp is important find a spot you want to be around and place it (remember that you can freely fast travel to camp and vault 76) then build up your Camp between exploring as you can improve it over time and can use it to generate food and water and use stash box as much as possible for junk used in crafting
---
Is he in a different position for everyone?
---
They just release an update on the newer legendary perks and they actually look really good, someone just put up a post about it.
---
ok survival chem is for a mechanic that is getting nerfed? of is this the nerf?
---
Really? I didn't see it
---
I suspect there  literaly just giving you a way to save 6 skill slots instead of swamping them in an out all the time.
---
Thanks. The camp aspect is something I'm really looking forward to. Love building a base.
---
Time to sell all my ammo then.
---
I had such a hard time from level 20 until around level 40, I pretty much had to stay in the forest and toxic valley area until I leveled up. I would go to the savage divide or cranberry bog for missions and get massacred 90% of the time. I‚Äôm not sure what kind of build you‚Äôre trying to go for tho so it‚Äôs hard to make a suggestion. As for caps I would pick up every weapon I came across and sell them for like 5 caps a piece until I had a little money, once you get a little higher level money starts coming in when you set up a vendor
---
Just before wastelanders launched, they had a purveyor sale. Everyone on this sub said to save scrip and just buy legendary modules. Information on the new weapons was scant, but even so, it took weeks of grinding to even get them; only to find that they're no better than the weapons already available. Save for the secret service armor, which only one of my characters benefits from, I would much rather spin the wheel at momma mumbles. At least, if we  get something great that we can't use, we can give it to someone who can: whether that be another one of our own characters, a friend, or a stranger in exchange for something in consideration.
---
Ya they do! Now they‚Äôre only 50 instead of the regular 50 :(
---
PvP was broken since Fallout 4.(Introduced Legendarys)
---
Fallout 76 made it worse. 
---
(Introduced 1-3 Star Legendarys and Mutations)
---
Before you say anything: A good PvP system doesn‚Äôt have a damage cap and isn‚Äôt based on excessive RNG.
---
/u/PhaserRave posted this earlier but to answer some of your questions:
---
What the Brawling chemist chem does: https://i.imgur.com/c1G543G.png
---
What the Survival shortcut chem does: https://i.imgur.com/VRTA7xD.png
---
Nuclear Proliferator is actually a Grenade type so no Fatman involved:  https://gfycat.com/mixedblushingchicken-fallout-76
---
nice rework, i just hopping for not scraping all cards for one legendary...
---
Not sure where you got that I was mad. Have fun out there
---
As for caps, early on it can be rough. set up your C.A.M.P. and get some purified water resources going. (i ended up selling most of the purified water to duchess at the wayward in order to get caps early on). I used the Hard bargain Charisma perk to get more caps per. 
---
Also the main, side, and daily quests help out.
---
Right haha and there are a good number of legendary enemies there.
---
They are funny as hell üòÅ
---
Thanks, corrected.  
---
I was writing a sentence and the number was just at the end, removed the sentence and forgot about the dot.
---
Damn I just spend 1000 script.
---
The ScorchBus Queen
---
You should make a note that as nice as some of these sound, the amount of Grind needed to max them out is virtually unfeasible. 
---
People on the PTS are doing calculations, and you need to be in the THOUSANDS of Levels if you want to max 6 of these. And that's assuming you didn't waste any points respeccing.
---
Nearly the same thing happened to me earlier and I've been looking through online to find the answer, thanks for the help!  (Wonder if it was the same person... I got the items via the same way you did)
---
He is like a counter to the end of the season I think (you have to reach lvl 100 before him to complete the season)
---
Hoarding is bad. In the beginning, scrap every weapon or piece of armor you aren't going to use. That's how you'll learn a majority of mods to improve your weapons/armor.
---
I personally have no issue with them. I think they‚Äôre quite creative. Been caught in a couple and at the time I was pissed but you just respawn and get back into the game.  As long as people make sure they don‚Äôt have any junk on them while visiting people‚Äôs camps then they should be ok.
---
Pretty sure I'm at 25 but cant remember if the NW pushed me over or bit. Still have like half my weeklies to do. I expect to get between 32 and 35 by end if week 2.
---
power armor? its absolute garbage in late game, even when they change that fire, antivenom. They should look at power armor in whole separate update to make it comparable.
---
Any Power Armor + Gatling Gun + some stimpaks and Radaway and you good to go to kill these level 50+ enemies.
---
Dude what?  Fallout 4 had 10 times better building interface having to scroll with fucking c and z build and edit in seperate modes it's a mess the should've just ported the UI from fallout 4
---
40
---
Honestly you can never tell with Bethesda. I mean I could make a stretch and say that it maybe had something to do with getting rocksy to stay in one place but who knows. It‚Äôs mad annoying when I I‚Äôm trying to run up the stairs and get stuck on it tho.
---
I mean a valid trade off for becoming a miniature Ent from LoTR and being one with all trees and shrubbery.
---
Fallout first is worth considering -- lots of atoms for spending on camp stuff but most important the scrap box and survival tent are game changers... gets rid of so many of the issues about stash management back when it launched. Obviously it costs but if you picked up the game cheap it's not so bad just to try for a month.
---
not everyone has good etiquette. just practice it, and give people thumbs up when they do.
---
good etiquette would be just tagging (body shot or low damage weapon) the Legendary and then doing a Follow Me emote. I do it all the time, unless I'm alone.
---
eventually more players will see what you are doing and pick up the practice. but you'll have to accept not everyone is going to do it
---
much better perks.
---
Its a light weight grenaid not a mini nuke but then I made that mistake.
---
Look at that happy face \^\_\^
---
Get a tinkerer's bench asap, (plans can be found at Lake Side cabins). it can be used it to make ammo, as well as convert junk to Bulk quantities to reserve space. You can also sell bulk items (cloth, for example) to npc vendors for easy caps; where as the unbulked version of some items give 0 caps.
---
Can I ask what you‚Äôve been doing to get XP and how often you think it takes you to get a level?
---
Same here. Not played for a while but picked it up again this week when I heard of the new legendary run update. Cant stay connected for longer than 10 minutes. Tried playing everyday this week but i get a guaranteed disconnect after 10 min. I knew there was a reason i stopped playing this game. I always gave Bethesda the benefit of the doubt but I just cant any longer. They are an insult to the game industry.
---
Most of their suggestions are unrealistic anyways
---
I only ever see it in the Mire.
---
IF you really want to grind out a Flatwoods Monster, don't extract DNA when you get the Queen of the Hunt quest. Kill the cryptid, server hop, and repeat until you find one. as long as you don't extract the DNA, you can repeat and force a cryptid spawn each time.
---
that's how I killed my first Mothman
---
We mocked their horse armor back then, but little did we know it was but a harbinger for far more sinister plans...
---
So it‚Äôs okay for me to ddos the entire server to kick everyone opposing me just because I feel entitled to a prize? No. Don‚Äôt be a prick.
---
Personally I try to sell more sought after stuff. Like bloodied &amp; junkies weapons (usually just buy them from other players if I find them for a decent price), nuka world outfits, BOS underarmors, BOS legendary combat armor, serums, nuka cola PA paints, combat armor helmets, mr fuzzy helmets if I have them, canned dog food, lots of chems, pemmican, etc.
---
Google nukes and dragons character builder. Dont waste 1 point you dont need
---
I happen to got both the mask and the jumpsuit last night if u want to trade for one
---
You made a lot of typos so it was a little hard to understand, but yea I'm not modding to cheat or anything, at least not make other players experiences bad, I just want to make the game more "friendly" cuz if u have played it for a while you can understand it's a bitch.
---
Wait, which one is elder? VII? I have that and it's nothing like that grey picture.. never knew!
---
This...with bells on
---
Super Nintendo bro, had to put that there because all the xbox players are coming up in here
---
Thanks! But I see a lot of people saying that they‚Äôll be able to equip more perks and such but it doesn‚Äôt mention that, maybe it‚Äôs like the mutations where you only get stat benefits.
---
Good luck with the grind! Pray to Todd they don‚Äôt fix it before you get there.
---
Is dog food a good seller? I use it for food sometimes myself, but never thought to sell it
---
No, thats cheating, what I do is a tatic. The game is meant to survive, thats what I do.
---
I didn't know SBs played Nuclear Winter but here we go. Damn bush wookies! 
---
:D
---
30. Although considering that its only mid-week two and there is a double XP weekend coming up, I'm not to fussed about grinding it out at the moment.
---
Oh yeah for sure. I must‚Äôve sold 60 in the last few days (15 caps each) and I‚Äôm running out now üò¨ I usually hit up behind the watoga shopping center for some btw
---
Both are dick tactics then. It isn‚Äôt life or death with this.
---
Early on, throwing knives are useful against robots and some other enemies, although as you level up, they'll outgrow their usefulness. They're also a good way to use excess steel you may pick up in your travels.
---
Yes that's the exact mod lol
---
Ammo Factory and What Rads seem to be less RNG favoured and best picks so far. You know what you get and it's useful.
---
Would say a bit too strong.
---
If you do 2 spaces a day, you'll pass him quite quickly. Use the weeklies and dailies and grind a few hundred (West Tek and Monster Mash are great for this).
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know much about load order. I just use the mod manager
---
Damn. So it won't let me use 20 point of str for cards? Well that's a bit of a bummer
---
Ok, cheers thanks for your help, I'm sure it will be of value to someone else üòä
---
Well a proper workable  melee build your probably not using a hell of a lot of ammo so you can drop ammo factory. and Cleave only works if your melee so you can change Ammo Factory or Cleave unless you plan to swap between ranged and melee. If ammo factory does not work on power cores you may want that recharge ability,
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you misunderstood what he is saying. He isn‚Äôt crafting or building his own mods. He‚Äôs having an issue with the load order of ones downloaded from Nexus
---
Thanks! I wouldn't have thought of this one, I'll keep it in mind from here :)
---
I dont want it either, nice to have low level areas and risky areas....
---
Literally every single scorched earth.  Trying to kill the remaining adds with a popup for leather armor in my face.
---
I had my rifleman cards effecting the vox my mistake. +karma
---
Thanks for the insight. Ammo is a winner for sure, I'll invest more in keeping a decent stock!
---
Gratz, many times I've thought of making a melee build for shits and gigs but always stopped after releasing no matter how perked up you are you're always gimped going melee unless you've got a good team backing you up.
---
What do you want for the mask?
---
Cheers! Junk and ammo I'm going to focus on a bit more from here. Gonna need to do some plastic runs haha
---
30k caps
---
I'll try putting these in, thanks! Never one I would have actively sold :)
---
That isn't irony.
---
There already is nothing to do. The score system, ammo converter, and glitches that were just introduced and haven't been hotfixed are just more examples of gross mismanagement and incompetence. I get it, the game engine is not meant for this and inherently a spaghetti mess they are doing their best with admittedly with zero experience. If that is the case and they really have enough resources and the right skills, then why does shit like the water wheel take 1.5 months to fix, and the ammo converter have shit just plainly mislabeled and in the wrong category, or armor you have to grind for hours and hours to unlock have blatant clipping and glitches that anyone can see if they launched the damned game and equip it? Its more than just "oh its the engine and its hard" as massively more popular games like Runescape for example that underwent an engine re-write while keeping the entire original game live and transitioned in less than 24 hours. You just have to do it correctly.
---
you can jump into it, the content is available relatively early but learning the game mechanics is the hardest part imo
---
it makes sense to join a higher lvl player in 
---
a team who shows you some mechanics, some locations for farming and where to get good gear, as well as helping out in some areas where you just cannot beat high lvl enemies to progress (mistress of mystery quest for example)
---
and you will have to invest hours and hours anyways. not to catch up, but grinding for gear and ammo like everybody else
---
Just because you don't keep up with the news....
---
They are working on it.
---
I just came back to the game this week as well since the first month of launch, and there has been a ton of content added since then. You can definitely play solo, but now they have added matchmaking tools to find groups in game, without using xbox's LFG system.
---
I am just leveling up through the new player experience now, but when the game launched, I was playing solo and was able to launch a nuke myself. I couldn't kill the Scorchbeast Queen myself, but usually other random people show to kill it as well, so it's definitely doable.
---
If you already have gamepass, it wont cost you a thing, so why not al least give it a try?
---
i see it only listed for xbox on the pass, not pc also
---
It's also very expensive, it ate all my ammo that took a year to save
---
Oof I wont be able to get that even If I tried
---
Obviously the problem is not calling every unrelated department together and have 3d modelers work on coding. The problem is that instead of prioritizing any bug fixes as their main goal from the top down, the additional projects keep coming out of the pipeline buggier than ever with no forward progress for big bugs that really need looking at. Adrenaline, the ammo converter, egregious clipping on score armor, score being broken, godmode score max glitch etc you could fill this post to the 10k max and still not document them all and the ones I listed were just introduced. But rather than spend some time prioritizing shit that really really needs to be fixed like a normal development team that is accountable to the user base, they'd rather ride out the cheap revenue stream and let the players numbers dip to hell (seriously 7-9k on a weekend after a major patch) and then pump it back up temporarily with cheap marketing shit like making the game available on Xbox game pass. Then when all those people get the picture we have now, they fade away having spent a few bucks and new purchases get the game back to where the metrics I am sure they are tracking dont make them crap in their boots, and they will go back to maintenance mode and the years planned out micro-transactions and content they barely finish on time that is still buggy until they cant attract new players because the game is barely functional which we are already seeing + lack of any serious content.
---
The cycle is so predictable it grosses me out and its fixable, but its harder and more expensive so here we are begging for scraps. The game is going downhill, much much worse than when it was new and sexy at the beginning and still buggy as shit. Seriously has there been a time in this games existence free from bugs and controversy? As vending showed us, they will only do what they need do to stop the bleed. I tried to play the past few nights and the shit is deader than a cemetery.
---
Additionally, most of their "ideas" like the ammo converter were [community ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7vh9f/instead_of_selling_ammo_to_vendors_why_not_allow/). Even then, they just had to literally copy the mechanic from the other games they made but noooooo here is a shitbox and another currency to fuck around with.
---
Worse thing is assuming we know the categories each ammo type falls into, just display what we are holding and a list of what we can choose, display exchange rate and exchange away...not hard, easier than what they did?
---
I know but that's only one at a time and you have to level up each time
---
Always drink as much Nukashine as soon as you find it.
---
I read it as them making it more difficult for high levels as apposed to easier for low levels. 
---
They've also stated there would still be differences with high/low level gear as well as different mobs (that spawn in different areas) being more/less difficult. 
---
Hopefully they get the balance right.
---
You could run to the bank after for your 3rd
---
more than 5 encounters for me. have some pics on XB.
---
Yeah just enjoy it :)
---
The bank in NW only ever had one accessible in the bank in NW. Another safe is up on the roof
---
It's really slow to do anything. It should have a feature where you convert a large sum of ammo instead of this pitiful amount. I'm kinda happy I have it, but I keep forgetting to use it
---
23.. I'm trying to get to the plushie before I have to stop playing daily, which will be any day now.
---
I‚Äôm still having an issue with the quest for the camera. I got my camera a while ago, but I still have a quest to investigate Anne/Ansel. When I inspect the corpse, there‚Äôs nothing on the body.
---
I don't think Bethesda and getting things right are on speaking terms.
---
Dude, the goal is to reach the end, there are more then one way to play. You dont get to tell me which way is Best, but I can assure you, I am always top 5 at least... How about you? Gun blazzer?
---
A decepticon! Autobots, roll out!
---
fixing the game? lol no we need a funni emote in the atom shop!!
---
Agree, what‚Äôs the point of different regions/areas when you camp in just one of them and farm there, visiting others only for specific events that will be scaled to you anyway? What needs fixing is players getting items that are way below their level - it‚Äôs no fun investing in what‚Äôs needed to survive the Cranberry Bog and killing a level 80 scorchbeast to get a level 45 wood Armor piece from it. It sounds to me more like a mechanic to force casual players into the grind, effectively removing any ‚Äòsafe havens‚Äô for weaker characters who want to explore. The whole proposed system would only have any real meaning if there was a more serious penalty for dying.
---
If you die, you only lose what's in your "junk" tab so don't be afraid to take some risks. I played it safe far too long because I thought I'd lose xp, caps, etc
---
Haha.. Nah I'm not THAT focused!
---
There is it's called hunter and hunted
---
Look for punch bowls in player camps, easy way to get Nukashine. Enjoy!
---
At what level can you unlock these perks?
---
...and this is why females are dominant amongst the scorchbeasts
---
i am not sure how you see that when the page list Console &amp; PC twice
---
Play the game whichever way you want, you payed for it, Rambo. Though, it doesn‚Äôt revoke your status of being a dick to other players just because you feel entitled to being carried for a win. A 3v4 for your teammates as you go make yourself a sandwich seems non douche like to me to I guess.
---
Except  adrenaline  is broken, at present. (PC, not sure about Console)
---
it shouldn't hurt you, players using exploits to ruin their game and complete legendary run in first day for example. Play game, have fun not pain.
---
That's weird, another friends says the same, it's present on Xbox One X but neither of us can see it on PC
---
That's an insult to games made in the 90s
---
The throwing knifes helped me get through the airport no problem thank you
---
No way man. I am a rebel without a cause so that means I don't listen to anyone - regardless of how awesome their emojis might be!
---
Hands up , now hand over the junk
---
Thank you for this.
---
Now we are talking, some of them are really awesome.
---
Actually I ran into my 4th or 5th one last night. Very rare indeed. My buddy took pic to mark the occasion lol
---
&gt; Not only that, new characters will have this all unlocked, so would never again need to use those cards?
---
New characters only start with the level 1 card, higher levels have to be unlocked by each character individually iirc.
---
Boohoo I cant grief BOOOHOOOOOOO
---
So trade it out in 6 mo, you can change legendary perks as well
---
If you think everyone would be happy to cross platform to PC think again. I know I wouldn‚Äôt.
---
It really isn't.
---
Flechette.
---
Close to 36 now
---
Maybe they were trying to help you by allowing you to fight your own battles. It is like in the movie where the hero tells the group to stand back in order to face off against the villain alone. They all secretly believed in knew and were confident in your abilities to overcome your obstacles!
---
that is huge!! a lot of nice things i definitly will take but master infiltrator is huge! no more swapping!!! thanks beth!
---
The next thing I‚Äôll unlock is the T-51b paint. So like 26
---
Or 27 or something.
---
Because the original and hardest one to get looks cheapest/ugliest one?
---
Im not being a Dick, yes I am not help, but Im not trying to kill you either.
---
Unfortunately cross-platform multiplayer is not available. I don't know about cross-save or character migration
---
No they won't be, PC players in the windows store will still play with PC players using the Bethesda launcher and Steam
---
yeah im looking to but it's only showing Xbox probably later today it comes on pc
---
Whatever floats your boat.
---
Only if you give me the facility to fly one. Then I can practice ~~crashing into~~ landing at other player camps.
---
Maybe he wants a tattered mole head, with AP refresh and weapon weight reduction..... :-)
---
What it does is make it more scary for everyone because no matter which region you are in the enemies are gonna kick your arse like the one tamriel update it‚Äôs gonna be Awesome
---
Actually, it keep the 6k gold t65 relevant.
---
Mmmmmm Howitzer artillery
---
Definitely the worst offender.  Queen dies, you are being rushed by fricken mirelurk kings with their stupid poison damage and BAM!! Can't see a damn thing now.
---
Yup. Did it day one when I used a new character and took pics and used stims. Lol
---
and makes a nice 'clang' when you hit something.
---
Honesty I might of. But still if you don't know what you're doing with modding Fallout 76, the game just breaks for everything.
---
Holy shit...this mean December or next year. God damn!
---
Not really, most of us one shot the highest level mobs anyway, just doing it in more areas isn't anymore difficult....
---
They will probably mess up most of the perks while fixing adrenaline with the next update
---
I really, really wish they would hotfix Adrenaline. 
---
I'm currently sitting on 5 perk points that are broken, and the AGI tree has nothing else to offer me (and I'm not respeccing my maxed AGI tree).
---
S√≠, amigo.
---
Are people really that scared of dying? Not sure why activating the pylons is such a big deal as I have had my fare share of coming across players who acted the exact same way, truly bizarre. If the pylons are not activated I will do it myself and Finish the event with or without other peoples help.
---
Not seen it myself, but wish they'd ditch the NW stuff, on PC that's a mess...
---
Bethesda have acknowledged both bugs, but at this moment in time are auto replying to tickets about it stating that they cannot change people's SCORE.
---
(not the link) i went to the pass site itself, listed it as xbox only
---
I dig the hell out of it. I don't PvP in adventure so that is my way to experience that and try out new guns
---
Rank 35 along with the Halloween and Xmas challenges complete for NW
---
Bro they actually changed the cursed harpoon gun from faster fire rate to bash damage. Like, it's still garbage, but now it actually has some effect on the weapon
---
Also, if they are planning on removing the food and water mechanics, what exactly is the point of the survival syringe? Cool for the other effects and all, but it seems like a dead perk if half its functionality will soon be gone
---
40% damage reduction and emergency protocols, no?
---
I don't find it to much of an issue...I am only using 5mm ammo for my gatling gun though.  Took me about 10 mins to convert about 1000 fusion cells and other small bits into about 3000 5mm
---
Only thing that makes no sense to me is the 2000 cap on points.
---
(fulfills SCORE criteria)
---
"No points..."
---
(Randomly scraps some junk)
---
"1000 Points for You!"
---
(logs off, deletes game)
---
"Instant Winner!"
---
my first and second game in NW was only opening lobby cards pack and then thrown into mess. Played without any card equipped because its no time to look at them.
---
my third, forth , fifth games i was only looking on cards and what to do in lobby. Still thrown into mess fight without any card equipped.
---
after like 50 games in NW you just told me i can equip more then one card on one special? WTf i played it wrong whole time.
---
Wow, this list makes me feel like Bethesda hired Mr. Torgue for a lot of their perk ideas.
---
Mr. Torgue: "My name is Torgue, and I've only got ONE question for you: EXPLOOSIONS?!!"
---
Bethesda: "Yes, please."
---
It‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt be the ~~way too OP overlord because of mods~~ courier or sole ~~badass~~ survivor anymore. They aren‚Äôt special. They‚Äôre just another NPC from Vault 89. They aren‚Äôt important. So they think that by reporting people that have spent time into something creative, they‚Äôre going to make a difference. Which they won‚Äôt. Me? I don‚Äôt have a trap camp. I like showing off what I can build, or how I can make use of pre-existing things. But I can give nothing but respect to the people that can actually pull off a good trap.
---
You‚Äôd think for a rare monster it would be a legendary, somebody shit the bed on that idea
---
My main concern about it is the ammo consumption. Right now, I find myself having to use a moderate amount of ammo on high level mobs but I can on shot low level ones. So basically, whenever I am finding myself doing to level events, I tend to make more money/scrap than ammo that gets consumed. However, when I do higher level events, I tend to loose more in ammo than I make. So it is a nice balance.
---
However, with wastelander one, all enemies will get buffed so it will be harder and harder for me to maintain ammo and supplies.
---
At least one
---
Sorry about the typos. I'm dyslexic and even auto corrects fail me, yet I'd be harder to understand without it. hahah. I'll space things out more, hopefully it helps make it easier to read.
---
I'm not against quality of life mods. Honesty, playing since beta, I fully understand. Just trying to point out that Fallout 76 is literally held together by hopes and dreams and breaks for any reason it can find.
---
Something small like a item organiser cab break the game in so many way if its not done 100% currently. 
---
But there are a lot of guides online to help. I don't think reddit will help you though due to the games experience with mods.
---
Join a building team, or start your own, the intelligence boost will help with extra xp and your teams CAMPS help you fast travel around the map for free
---
I like to buy cheap (100c max) plans and shotgun shells for 1c.
---
I would like to buy plastic, screws and acid.
---
I've never had an issue with it.  
---
I think if you're really trying hard to level up then you're going to find issues or bugs, but if you're just playing the game like me doing main or side missions etc then there isn't a problem.
---
I've played solo the whole time, and the game is pretty well suited for it, albeit a bit more difficult early on.
---
With the exception of the vault raids that have now ended (but more are on the cards), the bigger events are open to anyone on the server. Generally speaking many people are looking out for them and actively participate whether they are on your team or not.
---
I'm a level 20 on PC and i had only friendly encounters so far. One guy dropped me a goody bag with nice weapons.
---
üòÇ expecting a lot of this
---
Aye. I usually drop all my purified when I have inert flux. But sometimes you'll be running around and next thing you know the 100+ raw flux you forgot about goes inert and suddenly you are moving in slow mo
---
What's the community generally like?
---
This isn‚Äôt the discussion though I‚Äôm replying to what the op said about one wasteland. How can you complain about a problem you have created using to many damage perks.
---
It‚Äôs like going for a country drive and complaining it‚Äôs over to fast as you drove 100mph through the forest ü§™
---
I ve read somewhere around here that autocompleted daily challanges are caused because you are logged in during daily challange reset. So log out when the restart is comming.  
---
And TBH : For me is score system just another nail in the coffin. But happy nail, this nail cured me off the game with no meaningfull content. Bethesda is superb in starting good games, but  the moders community is the people champion who finishes the developing of the game.
---
It swallowed: 
---
10,000 10mm
---
4000 5.56mm
---
600 shotgun shells
---
160 Syringer ammo
---
160 40mm Grenades
---
460 .44 rounds
---
2000+ .45 rounds
---
to make 3k Plasma cartridges, and took an hour an a halfspamming one button at rapid speeds, I don't think an hour an a half to craft ammo is good in any game, with bulk craft in their parent companies games
---
Possibly the worst analogy ever...lol
---
You only saying that as it‚Äôs spot on and you feel silly
---
I'm guessing you're a high level... can you not make plasma cartridges? 
---
It does seem like it is better for single fire high damage guns... or new players.
---
Last post they didn't get chance. They died in two shots each. Now all 3 managed to get a shot on you by the time your auto grenade launcher shot twice. 
---
Meh I think this story is made up.
---
Hop servers, the creatures which I need to shoot change whenever I hop a server.
---
I just want the raider tree and firefly lights. The fireplace would be cool sometime, but right now I‚Äôm living at a pre-existing location, so I have literally nowhere to put any doors.
---
Noob question here: why isn‚Äôt the ‚Äút‚Äù word allowed in this sub?
---
I want my chicken coop
---
I didn't see that news anywhere
---
I dunno about that, they're pretty much the best in their respective categories. The lack of a new Rifleman/commando weapon is probably what throws some people off
---
Also SS is outrageously higher protection across the board than any other set or combo. The only reason I'm not using it on my bloodied is because I'm a sucker for pain and decided to try and roll an uny thorns set
---
Looking forward to the plushie and the firefly lamp too. Chicken coop too just for something else to add to a camp if I feel like it. Anything after that is a bonus. The door may be nice but its hardly secret any more. Besides, I've already got my 'secret' nuka cola door.
---
I want teh skill packages yeahhhhh
---
Not sure why you feel randomly generated enemies in a region of a video game being levelled to a character using a specific algorithm is in any way analogous to driving a route where I determine where I go and how fast, in other words, all random elements removed.... glad you're pleased with yourself though :-)
---
Generally we're just people. 
---
Some of us are arseholes, there's no putting it nicely.
---
Some of us are friendly, dropping gifts for new players.
---
Most of us are just playing the game, grinding for gear, completing challenges, etc.
---
Have you not played one Tamriel?
---
I wish they would up the limit but decreases the amount of vendors. So maybe have two vendors with 100 slots each (for example)
---
Wow I gotta go check that out in game
---
I want that white gas mask with blood stains... I think that would look cool with imposter sheepsquatch outfit.
---
28
---
A game that has auto aim, Tesla‚Äôs and stealthboys will never be good for PVP full stop.
---
Is it true that legendary attribute can't raise you above 15?
---
Legendary ability for those slice of life perk cards like scrapper and ammo factory because who doesnt like more ammo. Rest are really nice but those two sound game changers. Definitely ammo factory first though max that one out. Gonna make those people who trade in ammo cry but mehhhh ;)
---
In my opinion this outfit is easily the best outfit in the game
---
Flair checks out
---
I def want the coop too. Wonder if you can get eggs from it like you can get milk from the cow. I like having all these animals at my cap. Haven't had the chance to tame a megasloth yet. Just frogs and cows so far
---
Oh ok. I didn't read after, I just rage quitted and wrote the question. But it's good to know that they can't do anything about it so I'll not waste my time writing a ticket.
---
For those who enjoy cuddling with Mirelurk Kings...  
---
Yeah +200 seems like complete overkill considering +50 PR is usually enough and +75 PR is enough to shrug off even legendary poison hits.
---
Purge naptime pjs
---
The spit from mirelurk razorclaws and queens are poison. Want to say there is at least one or two more enemies that essentially have the poison/acid attack deal going on as well. With that said, 200 is definitely a bit much as I want to say just 25 greatly reduces the damage.
---
Wonder if we can get eggs from it like we can milk the cows? I'm hoping so
---
I want the cosmos lamp you get at level 100.
---
Or an unyielding bloodied quad ammo mini-bus launcher
---
Haven't had that problem yet with the legendary run, but it used to happen pretty frequently with the old daily and weekly challenges. I missed on a ton of atoms because of that. 
---
Hopefully they fix it soon, it can be really frustrating.
---
Yep, I'm in the same boat. After the first weekly reset, most of the dailies and all of the weeklies have been grayed out. Just in time for the atom purchases to make up the lost score. How convenient.
---
I wanted to say this as well. Dont be afraid to die.
---
In interested in that, but I wonder what it actually looks like in action
---
Yea seems to be what people keep asking for, at this point think Bethesda just fucked up not making it clear what it is and how to do it or something.
---
Headbutt Mirelurk Kings I guess. It is quite niche to be sure.
---
The blood eagle Handmade skin
---
I can make any of them for 300 caps, 100 if you provide the flux
---
Dont waste scrip for 3 star weps tho, only first two stars are important (yoy will never get 90% weight reduction anyway lol)
---
I don't mind that new areas will be farmable for high level characters now, Morgan town will be a blast!
---
Gotta read the post wall it's in there. Doesn't stack with cranberry relish. Also mentioned leader bobbles. Thanks for checking out my post though!
---
Well, that's shit.
---
Thank you... brave hero and savior of NW hacking. Now that you‚Äôve saved us all what will you do now?
---
Im happy with my space wallpaper and my UFO playground. But the firefly lamp looks also really nice
---
So they decided to dump all those legendary perks that reduce damage while wearing a certain kind of armor?
---
Awesome read, and agree with you *completely!*  
---
I want fireworks everytime i reload
---
Fix the lag first
---
I hate battle royals but honestly these challanges are not that hard. Most of the time they can be done with minimum effort. Deploy camp, stay alive 30 min: these can be done without playing an actual battle royal. Just chill in a bush. There are harder like use stimpacks, revive players, kill monsters, ... but you don't necessary have to encounter other players to do these either.
---
Good call for brain fungus bit we're already swimming in that. 30 fire cap is actually a game changer. If what you say is true. I'll have to take time to investigate since you claim it's ON our current route. I'll report back
---
Just unlocked the playground today. No room for it though.
---
... what...
---
Not sure, I found it last week almost immediately after getting the camera
---
He started at around 30 something, so the fact you're at 27 and he's now only at 41 proves you'll catch up in no time. You should be able to do at least 2 spaces a day, whilst he only moves one, so eventually you'll overtake and reach the end before him.
---
Very good and well thought out. 250 levels per is just gonna drive people away and kill the legendary perk system before it even comes out. 
---
Quick question - do you have any clue if the ‚Äúmelee‚Äù explosion and ‚Äúunarmed‚Äù explosion perks will stack or are they treated as 2 different things?
---
Also also... all the ammo crafting potential... 230% if it‚Äôs additive.
---
u/LvLThief
---
That's not the issue, Last few time I did this on PC I got killed with 15 secs by dudes across the the far side of the map or floating way above it, PC is full of cockend teens who think using a tool they downloaded makes them a hacker :-)
---
I think the daily ops and expeditions they have planned for later in the year are supposed to fill that void. But the raids just never functioned very well and ppl didnt play them much bc of it.
---
Right, maybe this maks Gunslinger builds viable. Would be great :-D
---
But a short look reveals, that there still are not enough points to take the whole sneak combo as an addition. The 9 points from all the gunslinger perks are just too much.
---
It will be a little bit better as a build, but i guess still far from good. I guess we would still need those buffs on the guns itself (armor piercing cylinder and such things).
---
I just changed it because they flagged the post as a "trading" post and they don't want that in this sub. Wasn't worth the hassle of reaching out to the mods.
---
No.. you get this on the regular from the daily photo opportunity quest
---
HA! Yes, I think I have accidentally killed my toon more than any other mob in the game. Talent!
---
There is the enclave uniform that you receive near the end of the main quest. it's pristine clean

I just started two months ago and have never played it for the same reason as you did. Now i cant stop its the best fallout ive played, im Level 92 now and far away from being bored, even though i got the two Main questlines finished, theres so much other stuff to do, sidequests en mass, i have definetly many places on my map that are unexplored yet, sometimes i just log in to do Thing a, while aproaching it i get distracted, Ending up doing Thing b, which leads me to c while i remember i wanted to do a, ah and I have to empty my Ressource collectors in my Camp, Well while im here i can build another level on top of my house with a nice swimming Pool, and just craft some .50cal ammunition, oh, Yeah i remember i wanted to do a... 6hrs later done so much stuff but Not a üòÇ
---
And ive played everything solo, have no friends either. I'd say it can get kind of struggly in the 20-40 level area but after that its a walk in the Park... Ofc heavily depending on your aquired gear. 
---
I found a Instignating/+40% bashing damage assault shotgun ( angry turtle fellas u know this combination üòÇ) like when i Was level 70 and oneshot everything except bosses. 
---
Man i could talk on so long haha 
---
Tldr: If you liked the previous fallouts and skyrim this is definetly a game for you and ( except for a handful events) very suitable for solo players. (if youre solo get 4 Charisma and lone Wanderer level 3 as it will help you significantly)

---
"  for 10 seconds " How would that work? For 10 sec after you equip the card? For 10 sec after a kill or 10 sec after you go into sneak?
---
When I first started I remember every area having atleast 1 max level enemy, made every quest a slow annoying grind. That was about a month ago I'm lvl 64 now, but those first 10- 46 levels were a nightmare.
---
Well if it was a problem with the old dailys too, I doubt they care. 
---
"Luckily" I didn't encounter this problem in the atom collecting era.
---
Same here. I constantly read these stories about the great community, but I've never seen it either.
---
My experience of other players (on PS4) is exemplified by being in the pipboy to drop excess supplies off for others in Foundation and getting hosed down with a Guass minigun by someone hiding on a rooftop in stealth armor for my trouble.
---
Coming soon! Ammo crates! To an Atom Store near you!
---
Picture/Video should be out in the next 24.
---
Me to. This seems like it should've been a given with a fusion powered exo suite.
---
Thank you! I tried my best to be on point and to provide as much info as I could.
---
They still drop, but the chance is 0.02% (datamined)
---
Does tenderiser stack with taking one for the team? Poor queen gonna melt in 2 seconds
---
Man I need those PA perks so badly
---
Well yeah...you can't do much about it. But they are not in every match, I haven't encountered one hacker yet.
---
They're obsessed with double trading for things, just like the ammo convertor, fuck off with the point/currency/coin/scrip based shit...please :-)
---
It will give fertilizer like the brahmin thing
---
But  you'd have even less time to change out perk cards than you already have which is pretty abyssmal as is. My main issue is the low exp rate for the time invested and it using your special stats from adventure mode. You should be able to have a load out spec for NW  and a decent exp rate. Currently if you aren't in the last 10 you're wasting your time.
---
They have expeditions plannned for the end of the year, which comes alongside the Brotherhood of Steel dlc.
---
Perhaps its tailed off, I did 3 in a row about a month back, same each match, never bothered to go back...
---
what is this idea
---
This is happening a lot this morning. I have to close the game after ever match as a second one won't load.
---
Right? Instead of visiting the lucky hole every other day you can go once a week. spend more time at the places to get more XP. Jeez, if this doesn't go the way of the ammo converter I can finally use my gauss miniguns as my primary weapon now.
---
how many caps u got? i got a fixer plan for 15K in my vendor, but willing to negotiate 
---
im on ps4
---
Now, I activate my polymerization card, and I fuse my scorchbeast with this bus...
---
I don't think this would work unfortunately, if your intention is to show them to other players. Photos are the only thing that is stored locally, and they weigh around 3MB+ each. In my case, I have a good download speed but a terrible upload speed, meaning that uploading each of those to the server would require several minutes. The same would apply for other players who have to download your photos when they travel to your camp, and if they have terrible download speed it would take forever as well. In general, it's not worth it to transform something client-side into server-side, and of course Bethesda cannot store the totality of our photo into the game code.
---
Yep. Lots of people had that same issue and it never got fixed. Stopped happening to me around wastelanders, but if it's happening to you right now then it means it wasn't fixed. I guess I was just lucky to avoid it for that short period of time.
---
I know that much, but wanted to know I'd it had the side bonus like the milk too. Eggs would be an interesting addition as a newly common ingredient
---
Bus~~h~~ wookies
---
Most looking forward to: fireflies in a jar, black combat rifle skin (if it can be applied to The Fixer, which it probably can't, in which case it'll become my top disappointment instead), maybe the Gatling gun skin, although I'm not sure I'll make it to rank 94, let alone 100 for the planetarium lamp.
---
Most disappointed so far: ammo converter and clean sink.
---
Happy to have: lunch boxes - the XP boost, the additional effects and the sharing mechanics are all appreciated.
---
Thanks!
---
As a player who dedicated quite a lot of time to this game I can't even afford 2 fully upgraded legendary perks after 1800+ hours spent in game since my main is level 476 atm. I project being level 570+ when I'll finish season in about 20 days, but I'd barely progress with legendary perks if they were a thing atm.
---
It's a shame devs didn't even think that some players might spend lots of time playing alts and after that alone they wouldn't get nearly enough points for any meaningful legendary upgrades.
---
I can't say anything about melee and unarmed perks atm, it needs some testing. But there's a possibility someone on PTS thread will be able to answer your question.
---
I like the icons mod especially
---
Much later this year. Probably by then the legendary perks are going to need some legendary perks
---
Lucky hole is still the best place for lead as long as you wear the excavator armor. there is also 6 lead nodes at the hornwright testing #3 along the cliff wall with the old bucket loader on the left side in a cluster along the bottom. Also the silos all have gyms with full weight sets.
---
29 1/2
---
A search told me we scrap perk cards for "perk coins" to trade for legendary perks. "perk coins"??? The hell are we playing, some FTP mobile candycrap?
---
Rant over. Thank you for keeping us update OP.
---
If you don't want to do the thing, don't do the thing.  
---
Fin.
---
At level 5 go into your settings and turn pacifist on and your golden
---
I got it yesterday, but my camp was already full af so I decided to build a new one including the playground haha
---
Epic!
---
Main thing I'm looking forward to is the stars &amp; planets wallpaper, getting that is my main aim in this season (though if I get there I'll probably try for the X-01 paint). I already like the stars wallpaper.
---
Most disappointing would be the ghillie armour, I guess. It just doesn't look great when I tried it on. But I wasn't especially excited about it so "disappointing" is maybe unfair.
---
Damn, that's so obvious and I missed it. lol :)
---
I am on 5.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm in my 250s on my main, but I enjoy playing alts and messing with different builds on them. I like the idea of the perks but to me it seems as if the devs are looking to years in the future with these... not near future with the levels required. I‚Äôve liked the ideas and like the new ones they‚Äôve added, but I just don‚Äôt see how these would really be tested well besides the guy on PC who is like lvl2300 or so (last I checked).
---
This is how I did it. Once I figured out exactly where to spawn, I had 2 done in under a minute, then I got the third in the next match.
---
I'm u/EnemyAdensmith

---
If you browse the comments here/on the PTS forum  the new perks seem very well received as an Improvement. But 2 big complaints that should be addressed:
---
1) The cost/amount of points to ulgrade these cards especially since the animated cards no longer give 5 is WAY WAY WAY to high. Scrapping all of your extra cards locks you into builds, removes utility and goes against the whole perk card system. 
---
2) anti venom/ fur lining should apply to power armor aswell. No poison resist is one of PA's biggest downfalls.
---
I feel you. By the time it's out, my legendary perks are going to need legendary perks
---
Ok cool. Was unaware of that. Thank you.
---
Doesn't have to be great quality pictures, if you look that the photos that you take there is always a second one(thumbnail) that has lower resolution, hope they can somehow use that one like steam does.
---
30 maybe? Little bit less . I'm a couple of tiers ahead of the t51 paint
---
So what's the point of an enemy exploding after dieing from an explosion ?  
---
All those explosion perks feeling like troll perks because if u take them u will make the corpses fly away and people won't be able to find them.
---
Easy, up your damage.
---
25
---
Sadly I have to force myself to actually progres the season. I am at level 11 at the moment. I am hoping that this week / weekend event ressurect my gaming appetite :)
---
I would love my camp full of glorious Enclave items.
---
I agree, that much DR on a bloodied build isn't even fun anymore. I've gone back to a mix of raider trapper and robot gear or is almost impossible to be killed.
---
How's the thorn set coming along? Same rng as SS I guess...
---
This would be a better solution, but I don't think Bethesda would be ok in adding another layer of strain to the (already suffering) servers.
---
I only want the Atoms. Bethesda can keep the rest, don't want any of it.
---
Not even cross plat, can't help :(
---
The sprinting sounds useful - the rest is ass :/
---
Not really cool, I was hunting the masks for over 6 months by grinding those fucked events. 
---
What's more uncool is that the 0.02% droprate was supposedly a bug. The devs were informed about this, at least according to the Managers "reading" here on reddit.
---
I‚Äôve had it happen several times with Sentry Bots. Last night happened with Sheepsquatch and one other I can‚Äôt recall.
---
Two pieces so far, rolled both back to back (one cav, one blocker but I don't mind it since the whole shotgun damage thing). For the chest and legs I'm gonna be about pickier about the rolls since the rest of my set is uny/cav scout
---
But then how would they massage figures and player statistics to show the higher ups? At this point I'm 99% sure everything about this game, except its story updates, are being designed with the idea of show Mr Suit that the game is worth it's staff and continued existence via daily logins to both adventure and NW and 'player engagement'. NW was a mode that nobody asked for, even if it was initially well received, and I can only imagine it's because some boomer knew just enough about gaming to know 'Fornight' is popular with the zoomers.
---
26, ive only missed 1 daily and it was a NW one.
---
21 or 22, casual player, no NW stuff, missed a day or two
---
What's on the legendary run you're worried about missing out on?
---
Don't we already have an increased ammo crafting perk?
---
I'm planning on building a new camp after getting a few more plans. But it's hard deciding on the a layout without having all of the stuff I plan on using
---
grinding normally n complete all dailies and weeklies now, lvl 29
---
I ve just now realized that there is nothing interesting ( for me ) whats worth the grind :D Maybe the star lamp would be cool :)  
---
Vaultboxes are great for my alt to get some material.  
---
And lunchboxes ofc. :))
---
Yep, but this stacks with it.
---
None of you clowns make the rules for NW. Stop crying about things you can't change!
---
I'm having the opposite trouble since the patch: my vendors are up and fully stocked but suddenly nobody is coming by or purchasing anything. pre patch I'd turn over 15-20k caps every day. I'm assuming everyone is busy with the score game and things will go back to normal eventually.
---
So what I'm hearing is pretty much infinite .50 cal rounds
---
I am not sure if I should be happy or scared :D
---
I‚Äôm at 6 as I can only play weekends.
---
As a melee main I approve,
---
It's a shame the bugs, glitches, and terrible, terrible unintuitive mechanics make actually playing melee frustrating, there is nothing quite like closing in to smash some guy's skull in the last violent seconds.
---
You know that the max level for legendaries actually is 45 and/or 50 depending on the item do you? So that wood armor IS on max level. There are no lvl 80 items or something like that.
---
Ammo smith and the new perk maxed is 230%more ammo + super duper i beleive.
---
But remeber the amount of perk points to get to max rank 4 is a shit load.
---
42
---
I'm probably in the minority here but I know that it's extremely unlikely for me to get to 100, so I never looked what's in there. I claim as I progress, that way I won't feel as if I missed out because I have a job or skipped a day/week due to other commitments.
---
Personally with how Bethesda really pushes grinding in this game I can't see legitment modding being introduced any time soon, and yes I know they mentioned it before the game was released but I still have doubts, maybe in a few years tho.
---
Gimme dat fat bethesda
---
PA should make you a walking tank, that can carry a ton. But it should require special training (end game) and should be scares, very scares. But with everybody complaining about high level areas, you know the want everything now instant gratification people that would never work. So to balance it you can get sick through a waterproof air tight suite, I can carry more and hit hareder while in BoS under armour (only) than I can while wearing my fusion powered exo suit.
---
25 I think, I'm on the alien ship camp item.
---
Well, one of my characters is commando, the other is a heavy gunner with the grounded mutation. There have been mostly negative reviews of the gauss minigun as well.
---
Things could be changed if, rather than jamming your fingers in your ears and yelling "la la la" like a child, you'd at least hear people out instead of *immediately* jumping to the "how dare you tell me how to play the game!" bullshit.
---
A friendly suggestion is just that. It's up to you whether or not to listen, but don't try to shut down the discussion.
---
The atoms so instead of unlocking cosmetics that we might not want, we go back to having some choice üëç
---
Knowing Bethesda, it's only natural to feel both.
---
If they only counted characters at 50+ for legendary points, it would cut down on people ‚Äòfarming‚Äô legendary points. This would require the cost to come down significantly. 
---
Or they could start at where they think a character should have maxed legendary perks and work backwards from there to balance progression. 
---
Utility perks should cost less to upgrade compared to combat perks. We are in combat more than crafting ammo or picking locks. 
---
Unless the damage used to recharge the fusion core is absorbed, that perk is pretty much pointless. I have 45-60 cores at anyone point. (Yes, I have a problem.  No, I‚Äôm not getting help) 
---
Auto-stim power armor perk is pretty underwhelming. If I‚Äôm downed in PA, I‚Äôm usually dead instantly. No time for the perk to kick in. I‚Äôd rather have a perk that keeps me from getting into that position in the first place. 
---
The defensive perk descriptions and how they actually work tend to be different. Let‚Äôs get some clarity on exactly how they work, and if they work in power armor too. 
---
The PTS is a place where people are volunteering to help Bethesda. Bethesda should be as clear as possible on how things work, intent, and reasoning.
---
I have a blast with my VFFR one. It's fantastically strong, sounds great, and fun to use. It is expensive to keep fed but I'd say it's worth it for the rest
---
Thank you, great read. I agree with you. Another unnecessary pointless grind.
---
I can't fully explain why, but the stars and planets wallpaper just seems too much. I'm happy with just the stars version. I'm not sure about the ghillie armors, guess it will depend on how they look on me. Just wish the ghillie outfit was fully camoed.
---
No way man this is a feat of strength! Did you do it in first person? I personally can‚Äôt melee in third  üòÇ..
---
Rank 28
---
Took mine down after some player came by and bought 3 machine loads of plans.  Pretty much all I sell and he completely cleared me out.  Haven't had the motivation or time to completely refill 3 machines lol.  
---
Definitely not complaining about that though.
---
What level are you now?
---
Great pleasure to read, as always. I wonder when they're going to hire you :D
---
And the explosive perks/ weapons can be fixed by placing a body part to the place where the enemy was killed. Let the body rag doll all it wants, by placing a shoe, for example, at the point of enemies death it will make it much easier to loot than to figure out the reentry angle and velocity of some of the body‚Äôs that are launched into low earth orbits.
---
&gt; Gold Perk Cards now only give 1 Perk Coin as well? 
---
This is correct. And it's terrible. It basically means that some of the highest level players in the entire game, even those who used XP exploits, will be lucky to have to Legendary Perks at Rank 2, let alone get anywhere even close to maxing one out. It's an ongoing and renewed discussion on the PTS right now. It's unreasonable and means most players will settle for having the first ranks of the cards and maybe one they take to Rank 2. That said, they listened (mostly) about how bad the previous cards were, and we now have improvements, so lets hope they listen on this too.
---
Spreading it is the only way to get it patched. Unfortunately
---
Same for me last night, on a server with 4 event teams, no one at rad rumble, no one at line in the sand. I started the supply run through big bend and no one showed up. Just Why??
---
It‚Äôs 25 years since the bombs dropped but it was the scorched that killed off the original inhabitants. I can‚Äôt remember how long after the war that was but it still makes it something between five or twenty years since the human population disappeared.
---
Where would i find more info on this? Videos etc
---
You're asking a lot from Bethesda
---
Oh yeah! Forgot about that guy, thanks!
---
It seems to me that a lot of people complained that Gold Perk Cards were giving more of an incentive than regular Perk Cards because you got more Perk Coins and people were forced into scrapping their Gold Perk Cards, which makes sense because you would feel forced considering it's 100 coins just to go from Level 1 to Level 2 of a Legendary Perk.
---
So they tried to fix it to help those who didn't want to feel forced by making the value equal which is a good idea but they went about it the wrong way by lowering the higher value. They should have raised the lower valued regular Perk Card to 5 Perk Coins as well. Or even to 3 Perk Coins, and left the Gold Perk Card at 5 making it less 'forced' to feel like you can only get anywhere by scrapping Gold Perk Cards.
---
They tried to fix it and had the right idea but went about it the wrong way it seems, and made it worse.
---
I think so. Nothing special.
---
I move my camp so much and idk why. Its so hard finding the spot. I'm set up in the mire rn for the creepiness of it
---
I honestly wouldn't mind them if it wasn't for the obscene amount of downtime. Especially as I'm now having to close the game after every match due to infinite load screens as well. Even the lockpick ine would be about a 5 mintute chalkenge if it wasn't for all the loading and matchmaking time.
---
Totally agreed, lots of fair points here!
---
I was thinking about how they could implement legendary levels above each character's initial 50 levels (similar to what blizzard did in their Diablo 3 I already mentioned).
---
PA in general desperately craves for much more love. It's a walking tank. It's on (almost)  every official poster for every Fallout game. It's by large margin the weakest armor choice in FO76. Goddammit Bethesda...
---
I cannot agree more that they need to put MUCH more clarity in what they implement on the PTS since lack of info from their side will only result in a lot more cumbersome testing (which they didn't even bother to set up right with providing free perk coins to test all the perks right away for example) via trial and error.
---
At the very least we need explanations on design philosophy behind every major change in the game they make with every major PTS update moving forward.
---
Yep, i beleive it was to keep balance. Those were very strong skills and would really make PA pointless
---
 *Smell that air*! Couldn't you just drink it like booze?
---
I‚Äôm also on 22. Got a couple more of the weeklies left
---
Lucky hole still works with an escavator torso (jep not the arms)
---
50 for the first slot. Take the link in the OP it explains it.
---
Thanks for your support -)) I hope they won't, gonna be hell to work there I presume :D
---
Thats what ive been hearing
---
okay.
---
I wish they‚Äôd fix the game
---
What? I‚Äôve had one in my stash for a year and don‚Äôt use it. Thought of using it when brotherhood dlc comes. And now it‚Äôs changed?
---
Yeah. And i got 5 characters with 900+ scrip each and i am ready to go absolutely HAM. Need to find a god roll fixer or HM so in case i need to trade it towards a red asylum outfit at some point.
---
Alternatively they went the right way about it if they wanted to make it a longer process and push up the value of Card Packs in a Season. A Seasons worth of cards is 45 Perk Points, as I count 9 packs on the board. When your only other avenue of getting them is increasingly slower levelling and increasingly sparse challenges/milestones, this makes them very appealing if you are only 30-40 points off the next rank of a useful perk.
---
My response is those are the only 2 legendary perks that apply to non power armor while there are 3 others that only apply to power armor.  I am not saying they are equally valuable but I think there needs to be some that only apply to non-PA builds to balance it out, but they PA one may need some additional tweeking
---
Sign me up for console crossplay. Probably wouldn‚Äôt want the PC playerbase just because of the hackers... sorry guys.
---
Deleting this message after I eat breakfast because I know most will claim God Mode.  After a hellish grind the past few days and 20 mins of sleep this past one I will be finishing today.  I am just about to hit 99 and will continue the course after eating.  Might make a temporary post with some tips afterwards.
---
I did that as well at first, but events and the game are much better with friends. I play with an ever growing group of people now, and it's added more to the game. Plus, you miss out on a lot of quality of life tricks and tips just playing solo.
---
I've only met a few assholes in this game, and it's pretty easy to hop worlds or mute.
---
Don't rush the main storyline. Take your time with it and do some exploration! The word is beautiful
---
Level 19, haven't yet done a public group or anything special. Not going to stress over it, just playing my way. I'm fine with taking the levels as they come, not forcing it.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
If this is their idea here then they're really pushing hard to turn this into a giant cashflow. 
---
Otherwise it was the right idea for making you feel less forced into scrapping Gold Perk Cards but the wrong idea for making the grind more... Humane?
---
Damn, the bastards are evolving!
---
not just flying away, for me he completely dissapears lol.. happened so many times
---
Yup
---
If they are locked to a character that is something new. Maybe the ranks are, I don‚Äôt know. I am assuming you aren‚Äôt in the PTS either?
---
The entire point of legendary perks is to give high level players something new to work toward. Everyone seems to want to have everything maxed on day 1.
---
Time will tell I guess. Let's hope I'm jumping at shadows.
---
I think you may have nailed it with the refundable points system. 
---
I hit level 300 recently and thought that once legendary perks came around, I'd be sitting pretty. I didn't expect to be finished before I started, but I figured I would be a good deal ahead of the curve!
---
Imagine my dismay when I heard that 1 card was 1 coin and 100 coins give you rank 1 of the new perks. 
---
But with your suggestion, I could at least invest, divest, rearrange the few cards I could get so at least I'm getting the best form I can without spending and essentially losing all the progress.
---
Lvl 28
---
cheers for the prompt reply, though it was a bug in the game.
---
thanks
---
No, thank you!
---
The grind seem to get worse with almost each major update, I hope this one won't be the case, but with Bethesda, you never know...
---
Exactly, and I totally agree with that. I've always said, if I can build a fusion reactor, why can't I make working plumbing?  Basic plumbing has been around since early civilization, but I can't have a working clean toilet? Hell, by now I could have dragged one of the nice ones from the Enclave back to my camp.  Lol
---
Have the PTS players mentioned if you can overcome the 15 point Special Cap if they use Legendary Ability? Because I have 15 Strength right so I wondering if I can push it to 20 if I use the Strength Legendary Ability.
---
Wassuuuup!!!!
---
I think we eat them, like Bobbleheads, they disappear once used :-)
---
It happens all the time. For me I've found sometimes it's lag. Where I hit the enemy and see damage numbers but the enemy is already dead via a one shotting pleb head.
---
Okay, I‚Äôll see you guys next year. Taking a break again smh
---
Fallout isn't nuked 1950's its the 50's vision of the future and what that future would actually look like and then it gets nuked. Its essentially an alternate timeline where everything is largely the same till the end of ww2, the transistor doesn't get invented (hence the oversized tech), fusion energy replaces conventional power, basically the cold war perpetuates until Russia can't go anymore and China takes over the reigns, a lot of other stuff happens on the global political stage, China and america go to war, China tries to invade america through Alaska gets wooped, america invades China, China freaks its shit, somebody shoots, world blows up... Fallout.
---
(I have coarsely brushed over the events and probably have the order mixed the fuck up)
---
Well i don‚Äôt have either the people‚Äôs or shovel backpack so both are new to me
---
It works if even ONE teammate is mutated.
---
Please. Stop talking. I hate when you annoying food builds try to do stuff like this. You havent any idea of pvp and just make random and stupid suggestions for stuff that either already exists or does nothing.
---
In my head they are like Ikea instructions. By the time you've used em you've got that frustrated at trying to understand them they are a indecipherable mess.
---
I beleive its been mentioned 15 is still the cap
---
Fun? Well what could be more legend than One Punch Maning and exploding enemies with your fists. 
---
Imagine, new player telling his buddy: ...then he punched him so hard, he literally exploded.  
---
Buddy: Bull shit.  
---
New player: No really. Check this video.  
---
Buddy: That's legend.
---
Yes. That‚Äôs what happens when you learn a plan. Otherwise you could just sell it after you learn it and make back any caps you may have spent on the plan. 
---
If you have a plan that says (known), it is a duplicate plan you picked up along the way somewhere.
---
And I now know which three I'm getting when this becomes available.
---
There are still a couple of dumb ones they probably could have done without, but these are pretty solid on the whole.
---
Oh right. I misread that for some reason. Thanks.
---
This is what survival mode was
---
Yes. I assume goes live in 5 hours or so when challenges roll over.
---
Yes, a couple times. Once was in the toxic valley and I saw a settler wanderer that was completely purple. I thought this was a glitch. When I went to take a closer look, the settler tried attacking me. The flatwoods monster had possessed the NPC to attack and appeared in its true form after I killed the settler.
---
I'm a little disappointed that you don't get legendary items from just any sheepsquatch, mothman or flatwoods monster because they are legends themselves.
---
Squirrel Army?
---
Lord of the Brahmin?
---
I thought that would be a logical thing to do if they didn't want to pigeonhole us in one build. But I don't think that was their intention from the start. They just didn't put enough thought in the entire system to begin with.
---
There were already a plethora of examples in the past that clearly shown they do not play their own game. Like, at all. Sadly, this is yet another example we see here with this system.
---
theyre  not rare, I've dumped dozens on the ground...
---
Fireworks cause the collossus to riverdance
---
It would have to be on a private server and all progress would have to no longer be transferable to adventure mode.
---
Dammit oh well this legendary perk went from being broken to being great I guess I will be readjusting my patch 22 build.
---
One of the main things thats always bugged me is that the headlamp on the combat armor helmet doesnt work
---
pretend that your character eats them
---
I changed it to another skin. Also seems broken. Just gonna remove it all. Fucking hell.
---
The biggest problem with PA is the carry weight issue.  I shouldn't have to take my PA of just so I can carry all my junk/ammo/weapons/chems/food around with Unyielding.  Common sense says you should be able to carry more with PA than without?
---
There was a case like you describe in the atom shop during Thanksgiving sales.
---
25 or 26 all I really want is the captain cosmos power armor
---
some nice tiddy and butt slider would be nice. As well as abs and better skin textures. It looks terrible especially in some raider attire
---
I think it will still be challenging , because mobs in mire/bog will have ++ extra level depending on yours.
---
Saying just 250 score per level is misleading.....to achieve that now I need to earn the multi thousand xp that actually results in the level up....
---
I need to check this but the internet says that this is 16k at level 100 and 80k by level 500 (roughly 160 x level +40). So, actual figures would be:
---
Lvl 100 ==&gt; 410 score average
---
Lvl 250 ==&gt; 650 score
---
Lvl 500 ==&gt; 1050 score
---
So this brings the daily potential up somewhat
---
Pussy tamer?
---
Dogging dude?
---
They should make it so u queue up for a raid similar how you queue up for NW to clear up the lag
---
And I forgot to mention that I mainly play automatic
---
Snake strangler?
---
A lot of people asked for a battle royale. You may not have, but it‚Äôs one of the most popular game genres around right now. It‚Äôs not for everyone but a lot of people like it. Gamepass will bring a lot more NW players I imagine also
---
Huh, alright, thanks for the insight. The only problem for me personally is... I don't have friends who play 76. I used to have a squad. Me &amp; three others but they stopped playing &amp; then uninstalled. Maybe I'll try going on the public servers again. Appreciate your insight.
---
Dolphin flogger?
---
It should. Just like it does on the SS helmet.
---
Monkey spanker?
---
&gt;game to actually work as intended with NO issues!
---
Sadly that is literally impossible with an online game. Because your Internet connection, the servers connection and every other players connection can never work 100% perfectly at all times.
---
Captain Cosmos Power Armor
---
Quite a few of these are area damage centered, like the explosion ones. I'm wondering how well that will work with instigating weapons in the mix.
---
Ahh, they're getting smarter! They figured out how to use armor!
---
Pets have been a thing for ages. You have to have wasteland whisperer and animal friend and find an animal random encounter and look for the tame option.
---
A stash would be a must have item :)
---
Holy F!
---
I can't wait, really looking forward to it
---
26th level, a few hundred short from 27. I still have to finish my last weekly (3 challenge in NW 2/3 are done).
---
Giant sheepsquatch plushie.  It's going to make my next rabbit camp awesome.
---
It is an unfair system, designed so any not hardcore player is unable to finish and has to pay to get it finished in time.
---
Visits my camp regularly and his buddy the Vengeful Mothman
---
Oh shit. I'm afraid they will close vending machines and display cases again to fix it. Last time they were disabled for a couple of weeks and that time was horrible
---
My must haves:
---
Ammo factory, whats rads and taking one for the team
---
No problem, I had the same issues returning to the game. Public teams makes this even easier!
---
I think AA gives you about a 20-25% damage boost generally
---
Where as junkies with 5 addictions gives you a 50% boost
---
Only the torse gives the 4x yield. Legs are handy for calibrated shocks though
---
Is that what the emotes are for? I thought it was gonna be a new other thing than wasteland whisperer like dogs from creations club in fo4
---
I'm sorry but who the frigity FUCK is gonna put a torch on a goddamn fedora?
---
Steel is the least of (our)my concern.
---
I hope they provide us with a respec option when they eventually release this.  Even if it's just a one time thing.
---
I just hate how long the event is and how garbage the frame rate is during it, it‚Äôs somehow worse than SB queen
---
Pretty sure you can use a camp to block the spawns, not just the fallout first tent
---
It's the NPC vendors in the stations that are used. There's 1000s exploiting it already. Looks like everyone will get that BE plasma after all.
---
thats why my FO1 tent is parked at the road infront of fort defiance since I heard of it
---
Probably for consistency sake, the black and red indicates an officer rank in the BoS.  Personally in fallout 4, I just made each rank use a different color stripe, elder got purple and black
---
Wish we had Brotherhood T-51b
---
Boy get your goofy ass outa here
---
It's not pay to win at all. 
---
It's an easy event which 1 person can do. Using the tent to force the spawn just makes it quicker and easier.
---
the whole card system needs removed! it dont make sense to change your 'perk loadout' everytime you do something, from cooking/crafting to doing more dmg for each type of weapon, it is time too consuming to change perk loadout and im sure everyone has attacked SBQ with Super Duper/Hard Bargain unintentionally enabled...
---
*Me*
---
If you haven't had enough resources before, then probably yeah
---
There's no emotes for pets atm. You literally just tame it, goes back to your base, if it lives the journey it'll walk about. It can die. Utst
---
Uh huh. That's why before Wastelanders it had dropped in player numbers to the point you could barely get 26-28 people into a match, and until Seasons started with NW challenges it was starting to dip again only weeks/a month after Wastelanders launched.
---
Bruh I'm laughing my ass off right now, people look goofy enough with a fedora on but a torch on it? Jesus christ man
---
Just add this to your Fallout76Custom.ini  
---
\[General\]
---
bDisableAllGore=1
---
that means bodies wil never explosive and shit.  They only ragdoll normally or they turn to goop.  I got so tired of looking for bodyparts.
---
Shout out to the FO76 youtube king: ANGRYTURTLE
---
Yes I know - that‚Äôs what needs fixing. That and getting 1* legs off 3* tiered enemies. They need to get fundamentals of balance vs reward right before they complicate matters further otherwise it‚Äôs yet another ‚Äòfeature‚Äô that breaks as much as it fixes.
---
Nothing.
---
Don Quixote called them home.
---
I totally hear you!
---
But I would personally be sad to see all the creativity killed on this sub, if we only spent time on listing bugs for Beth.
---
So now it is less then 20min? Unfortunately the NW challenge yesterday took already an hour to complete (were if spent about 15min alone in the lobby and loading screens). Complete an event? Made an easy event yesterday, that takes another 20min.  No, for me as a casual player it takes about 1-2 hours to complete the dailys. Less than 20min on what planet?
---
To market this as free update and than charge money (doesn't matter if it is 15, 30 or 120 bucks) if you want to complete it, is a total scam. Since when is it apropriate to charge a second time (after you have payed for the game) in order to actually complete content? This isn't a fucking free mobile game.
---
The town I grew up in was settled by the Romans.
---
I don't walk around dressed as a Roman.
---
Hey there I think it's called Opk (one position kill) and it's a very annoying hack. Do you remember the hackers name?
---
I've got no clue. Do they play their own game? It's a mystery.
---
Power attack with supersledge with right perk basicly annihilate any unaware living person in one swing, just saying it's not that hard :)
---
Silver shroud fedora is pretty cool tho, imo
---
Well they must‚Äôve removed them cause I remember seeing it in the atom shop it was like pet:trick pet:sit and things like that
---
People in fallout have many different styles , I‚Äôm sure most people wouldn‚Äôt walk to work in a grognak costume /bear costume either ... it is a game dude , loads of people role play and wear costumes and outfits
---
You will have those harpoon guns and rolling pins and you will like them!!
---
Yeah, there was pet emotes. They'll probably to something to the pets system soon enough
---
It‚Äôs not gonna happen. Just let us move on.
---
This is aimed at very high level players, and definitely shouldn't exclude you having several loadouts available (i have 4 currently with two handed, one handed, heavy, snipers, bows and auto rifles). It's better if you scrap everything, and a min-maxer would probably scrap everything except their optimal loadout. You still have all the gold cards since the beginning of your character, and if they're max level you can scrap them for max Coins and craft a new plain one. You're "punished" for not choosing the optimal build from level 1, yes, but that's on you if you care this deeply about it
---
New Fallout1st item:
---
US Military AMMO Can  (holds unlimited ammo)
---
Are you checking all of their vendors?
---
I'm not calling it difficult or detracting from it being a excellent XP farm. I'm saying it's low quality.
---
Junkies&gt;AA 
---
If your target has barely any armour then you're not really getting any kind of benefit from AA. It's great against super mutants though.
---
Morgantown is a blast anyway, nuked ofc
---
Beth just needs to make a toggle on the main menu.. PVP ON OR OFF.
---
If its ON you go into full PVP servers.
---
If its OFF you go into only PvE servers. 
---
/done
---
Every fight is gonna be annoying and an ammo drain now.
---
&gt;and has your game auto save every 1 min instead of 10. 
---
What is the benefit of this? and doesn't it increase load on the server?
---
im a certified crossbow expert 
---
sneak/vats is my build and i use the explosive mod on my xbow and together with explosive perk it's good
---
You can yes, but idk who would want to uproot just to make that event easier
---
 https://imgur.com/G8ZzWTo
---
Made me laugh not gonna lie xD
---
Lol Bushwookies go brrrrr
---
You can split items between multiple machines.
---
And some people are really annoying with this. Instead of putting all their vending machines together, they put them all over the place; top floor, bottom floor, round the back, etc, etc. Check everywhere.
---
i dont even know how to change hair colour
---
While I agree the initial perk system is far from ideal on so many levels, it still does the job. But they kinda forgot to put there the main quality of life feature, perk loadouts, which should be there from the start to begin with. This alone would alleviate the need to scrap useless perks for 99.9% of cases. That's the thing devs don't seem to understand trying to force us into perk scrapping BEFORE implementing loadouts.
---
I personally use Perk Loadout Manager on PC since its release (more than a year and a half iirc) and I don't remember when it bothered me last time to have all these duplicate perks. I press couple buttons and I proceed with my game. Couldn't care less about 150+ cards I don't use.
---
I think its like a fixer, with a 4th fixed leggy effect, the other 3 leggy effect are random
---

At around 35 sec you can see it.
---
Thanks for sharing this, it really brings some QoL!
---
Yep I‚Äôve had the same issue I grabbed 55 the other day my mate got 20 (he‚Äôs half blind/refuses to wear his glasses while gaming). At least 10 other people there and not a single other piece of ore was grabbed.
---
Stupid thing is they get all the XP for the kills I do all the hard work and they are better off for it. They should give you an XP reward for each piece deposited problem solved.
---
Off course. I'am greedy, and not Bethesda....
---
 "And yes, your reward is proportionate to your effort and investment.. That's how things work" 
---
\-You are talking like this is a free mobile game. It is not, it is a paid game for USD 80.-. It is a disgrace for the Fallout Brand
---
 "Most games just make you buy it at 15-20 dollars per skin"
---
\-Yes like Fallout 76
---
\-No, plenty of other games reward playing (not grinding) with free skins. But again you are probably to young and only used to those scams.
---
vertibots are incredibly weak even though it should be shooting rockets and be able to fo head on vs sbq 
---
so no, not a good suggestion to have 100s of weak-ass vertibots flying around spawned by players
---
I guess im the odd man out.
---
I love full health FURIOUS Gatling Laser/Plasma builds.  Batteries Included and Power User.. ammo for days.  FURIOUS .50 call for energy resistant ppl.  
---
Vampire 25%attack speed, 90%weight .50 cal for when I need free heals.
---
I seen camps that have a vendor machine in one room and another in a separate room
---
I thought Bobble heads worked like a suppository
---
Please stop suggesting people what to do.
---
You can switch the sonic generator off.
---
Just helps if FO76 crashes, you lose less stuff.
---
But I went from 134 fps to 165 just by watching his video and following him.
---
Even if it was the absolute worst quest in the history of gaming while it pays out like [this](https://imgur.com/8BLyzrD) i'll do it
---
No, you need to use/consume them, displaying them does nothing and is for cosmetics purposes only :-)
---
What event takes less than 15 min? Do you know good event which take 3 minutes so you have 12 minutes to fasttravel 8 times for the other tasks? How long are the loading screens for 5 fast travels?
---
Honestly, I doubt official modding will happen until far in the future when the Fallout 76 servers are inevitably taken down and Bethesda is forced to make it playable offline.
---
You‚Äôre not allowed to tell the truth here. Take my upvote anyway.
---
1. Oh gods, yes. I understand needing to have something so players notice when the generator breaks, but I don't think *relief* is what you should be aiming for...
---
2. This is annoying but not, as far as I know, an actual problem.
---
3. I find the XP stealing a far more problematic aspect of this behaviour. I think the game should just be slightly more tolerant about what spawn points it thinks are usable.
---
Even with those issues I kinda like the event as is, although I agree that it takes too long. There are other events, even other wave defense events, that I find much less appealing.
---
I feel for you here. Doesn't matter how much you play at the weekend (unless you have a marathon fully buffed xp grind... yawn), you'll never catch up with people who can play even 1hr per day. 
---
Hopefully season 2 caters for more 1-2 sessions per week players. I won't say casual players, because 5-6 hours each weekend day isn't casual.
---
Is this the same one from last week that has a higher chance of losing the item than duping it?
---
No it is not.
---
I'm disappointed by the clean sink too. I have the well for collection but because mine is on the second floor of my camp the pipes stick out of my ground floor ceiling. It looks really noticeable and I can't rug glitch it out.
---
Really looking forward to that secret fireplace door and the planet wallpaper. I rebuilt my camp around it. I've got a secret vending room with the star wallpaper, some red rocket connectors for wiring, all the alien merchandise, and the Mr. Pebbles plush looking down on it all. Planning on replacing a few panels with the planet version to really sell it.
---
Xbox is very wholesome (mostly). I'm on it a lot
---
This. Also, there is always the uncertainty of "is it server lag, or is this vending machine truly empty?"
---
Absolutely! I love building things and tbh I build at least once a week a new one, just because I have so much stuff to build that will never get into a single camp budget lol. Last weekend I build for 12 hours a real castle with round towers ect. Today I start a new one just because I want that space wallpaper everywhere at my camp lol
---
but u got shitloads of glowing ones running around to make it more fun? just shoot and collect, is what i do
---
It is still maxed at 15.
---
Me 2
---
dont replace gun fu
---
Not happy at all.
---
Thanks mate. I‚Äôve kinda given up with worrying about Season 1 as I can only play 2-3 hours over the weekend as my work, wife and kid comes first!
---
It‚Äôs cool, the Captain Cosmos PA skin is cool (and I‚Äôm a Junkies PA Heavy build) but it isn‚Äôt necessary. 
---
Do you think there would be a huge backlash if they put some of the S.C.O.R.E rewards in the atom shop down the line?
---
Oh.. I've had plenty of crashes on PS4 and not noticed losing any items. Not saying it didn't happen, just that I didn't notice.
---
Surely its 10m for a reason though, if the servers could cope with everyone saving every 1m without issue they would set it at 1m by default surely.
---
I think those are plans that you cannot sell. so once learned.....gone from inventory.
---
Whenever I do this someone will think its broken and go turn it back on.
---
Yep. It was honestly quicker to do all the weekly challenges than one NW one.
---
How does it work with the tent?
---
Well you want as much damage as possible to take advantage of that Instigating.
---
Hardened receiver. 
---
True long barrel
---
True stock
---
Stinging mag (30 rounds plus armour pen) 
---
suppressor 
---
Should think about going rifleman until you get a better gun. More damage per shot. more accurate.
---
Sorry but what is this post about? 
---
Must have missed whatever news it‚Äôs based on. Someone care to explain?
---
Write down or memorise places where you find plans and recipes. They respawn after a day day or less, so you can return and get more.
---
Same here on PS4. Quit the game, restarted, same thing. Rebooted PS4, same thing. Rebuilt the PS4 database in the system safe mode, still not loading.
---
I'm getting 300-400 score on it. Use a molotov and grenadier to tag all mobs with low damage (so all players can get exp). And I walk out with around 2000 steel scrap as well and loads of ammo. 
---
Why would they want to change it? It's fun, quick and profitable.. And you can disable the noise. You can also tag the scorchbeast easily and it will fly to you and you can kill it.
---
You have full control over the spawns and the flying SB. What's there not to like?
---
From the sound of the announcement it's that high level mobs will scale down which is a shame. Level 300 mobs that gave appropriate experience would be worth the challenge.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
For the first one you can go click on the generator and mute it.  You need to keep an eye on the notification area though in case it breaks since it won't go from annoying to silent once broken anymore.
---
I"d guess no but I'm not 100% sure. Since it's based on "kill" rather than "hit".
---
 they announced something not long ago about pets and it was not about the current system
---
the only time i‚Äôve personally seen a melee kill in NW was when the guy had a stealthboy. It‚Äôs a very impressive thing nevertheless. 
---
congrats!
---
Another post from may ago posted about their cursed harpoon having 2 of the 3 same effects. So either it's a big coincidence, or these cursed weapons have set effects and they only changed one of them for this PTS update.
---
I reckon there would be a backlash, but not a huge one (other than on here). I can see it happening though, and I wouldn't have a problem with it at all. 
---
People buying atoms keeps the game and DLC free for me, so I don't care. They might do the same as with the Fasnacht masks, put them in with a slight difference. 
---
You could always buy levels to get there, using money or saved atoms. I'm sitting on 6k atoms from the old dailies and will most likely use some as my daily play days are soon to be over too.
---
Yeah it messes up the AI pathing or something. I try &amp; tell people over local but they only listen about 10% of the time.
---
Yeah Ive had this. Cant do the weekly if I cant load into the server
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hf0dh7/how_to_make_line_in_the_sand_quick_and_easy_does/
---
It's not 100% though. Sometimes they spawn normally and you have to run out and move your tent a bit. Sometimes closer to the wall. Sometimes closer to the hole in the wall.
---
The purveyor can be 75% off and i wouldn't get excited. take your bloodied assaultron head, furious lead pipe, nocturnal sledgehammer and shove it. In my case even at 50% off there is only a lottery chance at anything useful.
---
I have spent so much scrip, sometimes the max (1000) at a time and have ever only got 2 semi decent weapons.
---
After the next weekly reset.
---
July 14.
---
Aren‚Äôt they only removing the debuffs? So it will be like sleeping? Nothing happens if you don‚Äôt do it but you get a buff if you do keep it in mind.
---
Thank everyone I'm playing every day for more than 4 hours and still behind lol
---
In the end it means you don't really get more powerful as you level up,
---
It should be a game or team option, so that if you want to play with lower level team mates, it's equally challenging for all in the team. That is the whole reasoning for it right?
---
But forcing it on everyone just means the game is always a struggle, no matter how god tier you get. That's gonna take a lot away from the feeling of growth and achievement.
---
If Skyrim is anything to go on, it also means a weak build build will be a nightmare to play, no matter how much fun it what to play before. In Skyrim, if you level up by crafting, you could craft great gear, but if you neglected your combat skills the mobs would crush you no matter what your gear. This will liekly force every one to use a small set of optimised builds just to play.  Ranged / Ammo dependant builds will just die, and we'll all go melee...
---
The real issue is there's no challenge for powerful builds. Only real solution to this is new content. Either by adding new areas that are more challenging, or something like Diablo 3 Rifts, where you can run a (randomly generated) area at a difficulty level of your choice. Both of these should offer suitable rewards ideally. 
---
Would be cool if the coming Daily Ops from the Fractured Steel update could do this. Get dropped off by a vertibird in a remote 'random' location and do the mission at either a chosen difficulty level, or 'One Wasteland' style as choosen.
---
There Bethesda, there's a free one for you. You don't have to break the current game (any more than you already have), or edit the main map.
---
I've only seen one after 30+ nukes. Got his voice box sack in one of my displays now. Hope it doesn't smell.
---
Impossible with today‚Äôs code. Speed demon already max out reload and movement speed.
---
Plus it would still not be viable, and another card nobody would ever use. I would see more value with a card that would give double damage for it
---
&gt;I mean, as much as I want PA to make me a god, it has to have   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;some  
---
&gt; balance over armor besides just not being able to craft or swim.
---
How about the inability to use legendary armour?  Full unyielding is pretty amazing tbh.
---
Boy goes hard! ü§Ø
---
Loved the brotherhood, especially in glassed cavern, they took the fight to the heart of the enemy
---
I don't know if I agree with points 1 and 4, but good to see people are passionate about wanting the best for this system.
---
Question though: Let's say I have a level 250 character that one day, for whatever reason, gets deleted or disabled. By your suggestions, that would be a huge amount of points vanishing into thin air, which may include points currently invested. How would you address that?
---
Thank duping and exploits or this probably wouldn‚Äôt have happened
---
Loads of times. He usually gets death deathclaws &amp; yaoguis to attack me. Wish his loot was a bit better though.. something unique maybe.
---
No it doesn't.  
---
At the start you could go up 2 levels in a single day.  Level 43 onwards you need at least TWO days to go up one level.
---
If you're 15 behind zorbo (lvl 24?) you're not behind. Save your atoms for the last few levels if need be.
---
Forgot to add, please submit a support ticket to Bethesda.
---
I honestly just assumed it was going to be this way and when the original iteration of this came out on the PTS I was like wait... this is so stupid and in this most recent iteration we are still having to scrap cards lol.  Makes no sense.
---
I use a handmade and use the exact same set up, only thing I‚Äôve got different is I have a prime receiver.  What rifle would you recommend?  thinking of maxing the perks out but unsure what weapon to be looking for and mods etc
---
When people use the word "food builds" üòÇüòÇ
---
Go play an actual pvp oriented game buddy.
---
I think you're right, but it still doesn't make sense to have this chem.
---
Thanks for letting me know was just going to catch up to him but ill wait thank you for info
---
Not every players deserves to have everything in the game.
---
I think they just came back under a different name this week actually
---
Just needs 1 other person mutated. The only problem I find is when people are coming and going and you don't realise you're losing bonuses because you're suddenly grouped with low level non mutants.
---
Ah true.. I was thinking it was hit
---
Can you scrap NW perk cards?
---
If you use the perk loadout mod its pretty trivial to switch them out, making this 'legendary' perk not very useful.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen the level changes on the stats. So score requirements increase per level? I wasn‚Äôt aware of that
---
Nah, I can't wait. I never visit low level if I can avoid it, and am bored out of my mind any time I need to.
---
I don't really agree that it needs to be removed, and to be honest, I like how I have a somewhat fluid loadout to be shuffling around depending on the situation. I would say it works for what it is, and I kinda like what it does, barring obvious quality of life fixes.
---
I was referring to the T-65
---
Well considering it takes the average player north of 1500-2000hours of their life to reach level 500, maybe they should be an incetive/reward for their time and effort put into the game?
---
I save up my script until I hit Max before spending it every time just increase the odds of getting at least one thing decent. But I wouldn't say it's a waste. I have pulled a chameleon powered sneak Scout chest, a BE fixer, multiple unyielding Sentinel's pieces.  Yes I've also pulled hundreds of nocturnal pieces but every once in a while there's a gem.
---
all i see, i must scrap all cards to make hardly one legendary perk fully upgraded. 
---
Well, fuck. 
---
Also , there is no content to play that long for grinding all fully upgraded cards. Its super grind, and this feature is only for 0,1% players + exploiters.
---
This is why I'm never unlocking anything other than the Wastelanders weapons I'll use, otherwise I'd grind for it all so I could have more variety to trade.
---
Dont beleive so
---
Floor gang 4 life!
---
Ugh... US Army uniform. Not the shadow gov one.
---
&gt;They should look at power armor in whole separate update
---
Maybe focusing on a faction that favours power armor?  :D
---
and are you gonna answer messages orrrr
---
That one gets busy nowadays much like Uranium fever, so I sometimes avoid it as the xp tag is less efficient. Good time to run through harpers or west tek.
---
Its a free item lol
---
I‚Äôve been saving my atoms for a while (First sub) so I can use them for the run. I would wait for the last few days of the season before you blow through your atoms. To see how far you can make it on your own. It really isn‚Äôt that hard of a grind. It‚Äôs been almost 2 weeks and I‚Äôm one space away from the orange section and it‚Äôs 10 weeks long. Consider waiting. The only real big item is the converter which is the 5th space.
---
But the system is made to be a long term reward. Its account wide.
---
Exactly. My math may be wrong (and so might be my assumption to how the system works as I'm not on PTS) but if I'm not mistaken...
---
At 100 Perk Cards for 100 Perk Coins, to level up 1 single Legendary  Perk Card you now need 450 Perk Coins to max level 4 (in the case where  each level increases by 50 Perk Coins from base 100 to Lvl 2, then 150  to Lvl 3, 200 to Lvl 4). That's 450 Perk Cards you need to scrap. With 5  Cards every 5 levels and 1 per Level up between that (and the now  additional Perk Cards received through Seasons) I'm not sure what level  you'd need to be to be able to do this without it effecting the Perk  Cards you have in your loadout.
---
However, to fully max out 7  Legendary Perk Cards you would need 3,150 Perk Coins. That's 3,150 Perk  Cards. If we still received 5 Perk Coins for Gold Perk Cards that'd only  cost 630 Gold Perk Cards. I know Gold Perk Cards are harder to come by  and this wouldn't be a contrast to only taking you to get to Level 630  (which even in itself for the regular player would take years and years  and years to accomplish), but it's less of a grind than 3,150 Perk  Cards.¬†
---
They shouldn't have reduced the Gold Perk Card value. They should've increased the Regular Perk Card value.
---
If it's true that goldens now give 1 point as well,they just f ed up and didn't understand crap of why we were upset!
---
Do they even check their player base? In every server there is barely anyone above lvl 300 and they want to implement a feature that would now take a lvl 5000 to complete? How can you be so obtuse?
---
No feature ,that doesn't account for rng,should require more than 3 months to be completed. 
---
I will go and post on the official forum to let know...again. at this pace we'll see these stupid cards in 2077 when cyberpunk releases.
---
That would be great.
---
but why would u need to shuffle your deck everytime you go from building to attacking, i just see no use to this, except for the fact that it goes well with being able to switch SPECIAL points
---
You should wish for everyone doing the event gets all of the kill rewards, even if they do nothing. I still want to one shot stuff when I‚Äôm solo
---
**Power Armor Reboot** - should give a 100% chance to revive with a small amount of HP (with an **extremely long** cooldown). Leveling up the perk should decrease the cooldown while increasing the amount of HP upon revival.
---
Yes, but if running incisor AA becomes pointless
---
Well HM and fixers are considered the best rifles for auto and non auto. 
---
But i sure do love those lever actions. I was levelling an alt and was like level 40 or something and on head crit shots i was getting 1400. That's ludicrous. 
---
And you'll pay less for a godly or semi godly lever. You want one with faster reload though. It's only 15% faster but it makes a difference. So it's much higher damage but slower fire rate vs lower damage but faster fire rate. Hard to choose. Go with the one that looks coolest.. the lever =0
---
So it‚Äôs not just me? I can barely move my cursor on that damn page.
---
Because having all of the perks active at once would be boring and remove build strategy. It would be a bad game design.
---
It would probably work like free fast travel and throingy Signal Grenades to let know vertibord to assist you.
---
But it doesn't matter, caps are not a problem and you don't need any assistance with bloody unyielding
---
This. You need more SCORE for each level up so atoms are definitely most worth to spend at the end to get the last higher levels (if you're not gonna make it through challenges), as the atom cost is the same.
---
A trap camp i just sneaky griefing and whoever builds one should be ashamed of themselfes.
---
Just seen a video of a low lvl getting killed after he bought flux for 20000 caps...
---
Ive seen some funny ones but mostly its griefing and that has no place in our community
---
yeah, i play on ps4 so it's extra painful for me to do that everytime 
---
i'd just rather see a skill tree with categories for building/attacking/etc based on SPECIAL points
---
I fought it around top of the world, the loot was poor.
---
Bethesda is one of the rare game developers who treat their employees well. Their games may be janky and buggy, but their company culture is supposed to be amazing...
---
I want some raider aesthetics or junk walls
---
Tbh I don't care about any of this, I just want to remove duplicate/useless perks that clutter my perk screen.
---
Well there's plenty of spaces in the Wasteland where you can set up shop. I was visiting this vendor yesterday and he build his camp in the underground tunnels beside Watoga. And hot damn i can tell you it looked awesome, that was some real post war building
---
Not before level normalisation
---
soz it just dont satisfy me to select the same cards everytime and i dont want to change my build cuz i like it
---
It also auto unlocks them. At max level you can do the locked nuke silo door and insta hack to rush it faster
---
Not possible. Just imagine the server load with It or people abusing the system
---
You have to increase the weapon accuracy. Changing the receiver, barrel, and sight that increases the weapons accuracy the most fixes the miss issue. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs own hit ratio that comes before vats hit percentage. You can take it one step further with the last bastion armor and formula p/q. I first found this out when I got survival modes two shot shotgun (salt of the earth). Like all two shots, it had a lower accuracy and I‚Äôd miss on 95% vats shot until I added the ‚Äútrue‚Äù mods
---
Wow, i didn't know it was that bad. How can they possibly think that its okay the way it is? It sounds insanely bad and backwards. Are they actively trying to ruin the game at this point?
---
Anyway, i wont say more since the legendary perk system is ways off still, but i don't think anyone can blame me for being pessimistic with the way lots of mechanics are being handled in this game.
---
THIS! Not criticizing anyone who enjoys NW, but I never played it because I knew I'd hate it. I did a couple of.NW challenges last week and hated it just as much as expected, so I'm not doing those challenges and it fucks me for completing the season. These challenges actually reduce my overall enjoyment of the game!
---
Currently I‚Äôve got a furious handmade and a quad fixer which I flip between the 2. HM does 126 base and fixer is 99. But I‚Äôm at the point in the game where I‚Äôve only got the grind to do and this legendary run thing. So I‚Äôm just having a mess about with my perk cards as I‚Äôve got a bit of time to work on them.  Thanks for your help, I‚Äôll look for a lever üòÅ
---
Sure I understand it being long term, but how long do they plan on supporting the game? Do they want everyone to be at like level 5000? Like I really enjoy the game, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but with the end game as it is now (non-existent), that won‚Äôt really work
---
I do it solo. I'll fail the event, esp on my bloodied, but the ex from the ghouls is worth it. The glowing blood sells great too.
---
I totally lost any interest in the feature. I told you already in the other post that it eas a grind too big to be bearable.
---
Now it basically became at least 3 times bigger with golden cards worth 1 as well.
---
They should have done the opposite and made every card worth 5 ffs! At least!
---
Did they remove the flat damage resistance with matching armor perks
---
I despise NW as much as the next person.  That being said I find the easiest most efficient ways to complete those missions because I do not like missing out on a little bit of score.
---
For the most recent challenge with pick 3 locks there is a farm on the Morgantown map North of Bolton greens with a rounded metal barn that always has a locked tool box inside..
---
 (I call it crazy cat ladies place since there's tons and tons of cat bowls and side of the house.)
---
 Anyway choose your spawn point on that barn, run inside and unlock the Box, log out... rinse and repeat 3 times.
---
 I have seen numerous posts with other areas with fixed locked chests or boxes that you can always run to.
---
 Some of them are quite easy to finish like the "use 3 stim packs".  It's not that hard to find 3 stim packs then you just run into the fire area and used them and then log out... done.
---
"Place 3 camps"  This one took me 10 seconds before I logged out of the match. Stand in one spot and drop your camp 3 times, logout... done
---
I'll believe it when I see it dude, even if the damage was possible, which I doubt, you still only get one chance to get 1 or maybe 2 hits in before you get melted 
---
Plus the hit registration for melee is rediculously bad
---
Yep, assuming to balance armor vs power armor.
---
That's your loss. Togas are comfy af.
---
You should give that one a try, the limb damage perk makes it a ‚Äòmagic‚Äô gauss shotgun. Try it in vats, you should see glitchy looking numbers when the shots do hit.
---
Am i missing something? No legendary perk card for heavy gunners other then the 10% chance of an npc exploding?
---
Experience is the best teacher mate
---
Always always claim workshops for these challenges. Been there done that. Not going back.
---
Trap camps. Need I say more?
---
Crap, that was the one I was looking forward to the most
---
I'm not interested in joining but you can count this Brotherhood of Steel soldier as an ally.
---
Anyone know where the slocum joe 's bar is in the build menu? I cant find it
---
Nope. Just an extremely low drop rate.
---
Oof, that‚Äôs a good idea. Thanks. It‚Äôs even worse that I recently watched a YouTube video about building in the water, and the creator said ‚Äúmake sure it‚Äôs exactly where you want it because you can‚Äôt delete it‚Äù etc. I really didn‚Äôt think I was even that low, it felt like it snapped lower than I had it lol.
---
No. I‚Äôve never had trouble finding a match on Xbox. Always full lobbies.
---
Console player :P
---
I love how you fail to grasp simple concepts. Games need money to survive. You paid for the game, you got the game. PERIOD.  That was your initial transaction. 
---
They continue to produce updates and content which cost time and money. They need a revenue stream to continue to do so. Your greedy ass wound rather the game charge for nothing and die off only so that you can feel accomplished for doing nothing while you play 1-2 hours a week.
---
My advice? Find a new game if this one is so horrible. Do us all a favor. 
---
Also you have to love the argumentative style there at the end. Insult someone by calling them a child to make yourself feel somehow superior due to age, as if age is a measure of merit or knowledge, while simultaneously failing to provide and references or examples.
---
I'm quite happy for unlocking the Sheepsquatch Plushie. I'm pretty sure I got reported for "cheating" just by power grinding for it under a week.
---
*sign flips properly*
---
*Doors no longer open, no ETA on fix*
---
I feel the same, I'm so looking forward to this
---
Though I guess I could get +5 strength and throw on barbarian
---
You seem to miss the point that perk loadouts will deal with this problem much more effectively. And *this is what they need to release first*. Most people wouldn't even care how many cards they have if they won't be forced to switch between them every so often, scrolling through their entire library everytime. If perk loadout switching would be available from the start, I assure you, there'll be little to no people complaining about this situation.
---
I agree that at some point it would be sorta QoL feature to completely remove cards for people that are annoyed because of lots of useless stuff lying around (I assume this is what bothers you?). For majority of others loadouts will be a gamechanger here.
---
Also, no need to be rude. Please, let's keep the discussion civil.
---
Thanks, because I have some friends who tells me it's legacy, the camo can drop in the forest area of the map right? Right side?
---
I have had my main characters camp in the same spot for well over 6 months.  If this happened to me I would probably be forced to uninstall the game.  So I feel your pain. I hope this post helps others out.
---
Are you referring to [this? wiki link](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Camo_ops_outfit).  I don't have a clue if it's a legacy, only been playing for 3 months.  I thought that legacy in FO76 was a term for gear that was determine too powerful and discontinued.   Is that not accurate? 
---
Appears it's an underarmor, so would be covered up by armor once properly outfited.  Sorta defeats the purpose of getting a cool looking underarmor.    I wonder what type of linings it takes?  BoS?
---
They could have added another damage reduction perk for PA users :) but I guess this works too
---
I lied because i find these posts pointless. 
---
Most of the time it's people wanting to flex. "Oh yeah. I haven't pushed hard or anything but i'm on 35. Yeah."
---
And then other players who thought they were doing well are like "I'm not doing well!' and it generates bad energy.
---
Nope, I refeer to the jumpsuit camo
---
It‚Äôs 100% my fault, because I knew about this being an issue, I just wasn‚Äôt careful enough. I flaired this post as a ‚Äúbug‚Äù because I feel like if the game says ‚Äúcan‚Äôt place here; item is underwater‚Äù then it probably shouldn‚Äôt place the item haha.
---
Ushanka with flashlight, nuff said
---
Well, it looks to me sometimes that someone or something is constantly sabotaging the development process by making all these poorly thought out design decisions.
---
They still have time to make things right, but how much of people's good will they burn through in the process?
---
"I've barely played but I'm on 60 already, the hell is wrong with all of you" sort of mantra. Yeah I get it ahaha
---
I‚Äôm beyond disappointed with legendary perks. Major changes need to be made.
---
Hey, just trying to spread the word because I saw in another post, the red asylum outfit has been confirmed to be duped to hell on all platforms. I hope you were being sarcastic about trading a god roll for it, but it any case don‚Äôt overpay for that outfit right now cuz it‚Äôs been duped.
---
You can glitch yourself to lv 2000 and it still won't be enough to level up your legendary cards!
---
There's lots of things that could've been done to reimagine this system, but still here we are...
---
Yeah. I spent about 4 hours building and rebuilding a camp and then after i was finally happy with it i decided to put a block in the water and put a statue on it. As i pressed the button to place it so it was slightly out of the water it went under. Couldn't get it out. It took all of my willpower not to scrap the whole camp and start again. Every day for about a month it sat under the water mocking me.
---
I do slightly disagree with the end, mainly because some of them *are* actually pretty damn good. 
---
For example, the ability to have AoE melee or regen AP and health when blocking are two solid abilities I could see as legendary effects in game. And being able to add five extra cards to a stat isn‚Äôt bad either. 
---
Though the fact the Blood Sacrifice still requires death is dumb and stupid and I hate it. That just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Should be when downed, but then it‚Äôs farmable.
---
20 hours
---
 I have also heard about looting 180 world items.
---
Never understood why those paints were not available for Ultracite PA... The BoS were the one's that developed that, isn't it?
---
Like I said, I‚Äôve spent hours and hours on this camp, and I‚Äôve had to rebuild it once. I know the setup of it pretty well now, where it might only take a couple hours to rebuild. That‚Äôs IF I can get the circle in the exact same spot. Half of my camp is next to the pond, while the other half goes over the cliff and down, so I have sort of a secret room built on the edge of the cliff. If I don‚Äôt get it put in the exact spot, it may not work exactly the same as before.
---
While they're at it they can get rid of that timer. Forcing difficulty through timers is the laziest way to develop a raid.
---
I despise timed content like that.
---
Coming
---
I'm using Ammosmith. It does nothing against enemies but at least I don't forget to equip it for crafting to compensate for the increased ammo consumption...
---
Did you hit max caps 30k?
---
LMAO.  Bobblehead fell out though.
---
This system would be unacceptable in any other game due the fact that some players already lost coins due not receiving more then 2 duplicates of the same card. Bethesda has a way to execute good ideas like apes would.
---
Um, yes?
---
It should be like the champion point system of Elder Scrolls Online, you gain points directly from your level, and they are account wide.
---
I find its going to severely fuck up the flow of the game, just like one tamriel did for ESO, except the morons who implemented it in ESO are not taking ammo consumption into effect, though i hope it fixes the spawn issues, like when I'm busy fight a crowd of ghouls in the swamp and then a swarm of super mutant rush in along side a horde of bugs too
---
How many legendary perks can you have at once?
---
Well it's interesting because sometimes they are very much supporting alt characters. I myself did not really subscribe to that, I'm more of a one character to rule them all. Then on the other hand they do this with the perk cards.
---
I guess there is always a balance. Fortunately for me I do play one character so any legendary perk I invest in will be 'used' without fear of losing progress. I mean I wish I could be a melee, shotgun, heavy guns, assault rifle build with the option to mess around with pistols... But for now I'll stay primary melee with some heavy guns for range.
---
And a tesla for tagging.
---
And a sub machine gun for fun.
---
No power armor though, that stuff is smelly
---
You need to clench more :-)
---
Can we swap Bethesda accounts? :&gt;
---
:tips fedora:
---
M'Lighty
---
I'm a little confused.  They are supposed to vanish once you read them, but so are camp item and recipe plans.  From what you said though those plans aren't disappearing when you use them?  That's not normal if so.
---
More than likely has. OUCH!
---
For me, everything in vendors has to fall into one of the following catagories:
---
Rare, desirable, convienient, cheap.
---
Rare is the stuff people cant just go and get - good legendaries, rare outfits, rare plans. These can command a higher price because of their lack of availability.
---
Desirable is things that people want, but are a bit awkward to find. Things like bobbleheads/magazines for displays  - they could spend time server hopping to find the one they're missing, or they could buy yours. Same with serums - readily available from MODUS, but people dont want to pay that price. Ballistic fibre, and to some extent screws would also fall into this.
---
Convienient is things that people COULD do themselves, but why bother when you have it easily available? Things like ammo - its not hard to gather supplies and craft. But if you've got caps burning a hole in your pocket and someone is selling 10,000 5.56rnds then thats a lot faster.
---
Cheap is things people will buy simply because of how cheap they are. Im not looking for the plans of slightly-different-dustbin, but you're selling it for 25c?  Might pick that up, because you never know.
---
Min 15 Strength :-)

---
Golf club is a great place to loot stuff to reset spawns as there's just SO much stuff.
---
Yeah i lost 3k on flux by hitting max. Someone came along and bought it all. I keep trying to find ammo sellers to drop my caps on to stay around 20k now.
---
Been waiting for this display case to come back in the atom shop for months
---
There has been an influx in cheaters of late.  Often the view can moves to a player in the center of the map high up.  
---
So now I've started screenshotting, as has their details on the sidebar.  Currently building up an album to then report to Bethesda.
---
There‚Äôs score challenges in the files for stuff like ‚Äúpet a cat‚Äù and I think ‚Äúbuild a doghouse‚Äù so they are still actively working on it at least.
---
I used to be xp farmer I've started running the tunnels for the the chance to get the rare plans and the people supposed be watching the scavengers still manage to mess that up. Maybe there should be team events but individual rewards for what part you played towards the event .
---
It can take my scrap and legendaries home to my stash. You throw a signal grande and give it the items you want it to stash for you. Way better than those magic scrap kits. 
---
Disclaimer: I've never used 1, they might work very good. Just don't like the, it just works like magic idee much.
---
Not really.  I put them in my vending machine for cheap though and they pretty much always sell, but if you are doing Davenport's daily they start to pile up.  Have like 10 of each lens plan in my stash at this point and I'm about to just dump them somewhere.
---
Because Bethesda‚Äôs lazy ass shit and just potted over skins from fallout 4
---
25 right now, should be around 32 to 25 by end of week
---
Or even a super duper hard terminal to crack.  Like in NW where it reveals players , it reveals vendors.
---
No.  I am at 17K caps.
---
No.   At 17K caps.
---
No.  At 17K caps.
---
I have had to bail while someone is buying because i've either hit cap or about to hit cap. I do send them a message and explain why i went. Most are cool with it and understand. Some guy was all 'Well when you are ready let me know as i'm about to drop 8k on your asylum uniforms' Which was nice. I don't have any serum recipes to buy anymore. I've started buying random plans from npc vendors every time i am near 20k.
---
I think investing in ammo is wise. Good shout. I have an alt who stores all my excess ammo. So no problem carrying it.
---
Ok, I didn't think about it first, but let's discuss, how it could be implemented.
---
As I see it now, it could work similar to Diablo 3 Paragon levels system, which lets you gain  additional separate levels to constantly increase character's power beyond the initial 70 levels, that you need to get all the character's abilities. Paragon levels are account-wide and all xp every character gains beyond level 70 goes to account-wide pool, which is transformed into paragon levels. Every character can use benefits current paragon levels can give.
---
It can work the same here. After level 50 you can start gaining legendary XP, that counts towards accumulating legendary levels, that are account-wide. After accumulating enough "legendary" levels you'll be able to invest them into legendary perks or additional character stats. And reallocate these levels freele as you wish. And that's gonna be available for every character, so progressing with one char will automatically add some power to all others. If you delete a character, you'll only lose the initial 50 levels needed to start accumulating legendary XP. But the legendary XP pool will remain intact.
---
Triple post? Jeez..
---
They'd never be that generous, at most it'd probably only fit 1 micronuke's worth of weight!
---
I'm very suspicious of that Zorbo character.  How's he so far ahead?  Clearly he is XP glitching
---
Could be a UI bug, did the caps definitely not get added?
---
Also the cap amount might have been added together if they bought both quickly. Do you 100% remember how much you listed it for?
---
That sure is a novel idea of what do once you've grinded out the daily and weekly challenges
---
No, you guys.   I've played for 1700 hours.   I am aware of the cap limit.  I'm at 17K.
---
Morrowind is still a buggy mess!
---
That's a really good breakdown. Highlights what should be for sale. Thanks a lot, this helps massively :)
---
It was supposed to, day 1 bug finally fixed, about 199 to go :-)
---
6
---
I was thinking about doing this, but play on my own on PS4 so no reliable way of getting it to an alt.
---
They claimed it was working as designed to some folks.....pure bollocks :-)
---
That isn't healthy. At all.
---
Yes.   17K + 8K + 1K = 26K, is where I should be sitting, and I'm still looking at exactly 17K caps.
---
Buying Flux for 20k means this one went out through Darwinism and was probably for the best.
---
Jesus, are you ok? Why put that strain on yourself? Theres 8.5 weeks left
---
Morgan town, just North of Bolton Greens is a farm with a rounded metal barn.  Inside that barn is a locked tool chest.
---
Pick that barn as your spawn point, unlock tool box, logout, repeat.
---
Best advantage is not having to find guns with the mods you need. For example, you can improve your sniper rifle to have increased range. You can improve your shotgun to have increased damage, etc.
---
Oh so you were at 17k before they bought it?
---
The UI is sometimes delayed, so could show a purchase from a little while ago?
---
Yes, this is a nuclear wasteland not a theme park.
---
Well, right now it takes lvl 1500 to level up 1 card for each of the 6 available slots. But yeah, these cards will only be available on ONE character which is kinda strange. Seems like any amount of dedication players put into this game to play fair will never be enough to at least make couple fairly strong legendary built characters.
---
I heard that the 50% durability does not work
---
Yes.   At 17K before their purchase and still at 17K.
---
Everything nuked is a... blast!
---
Have you been to Megaton?
---
Yeah and i hope your post is another incentive to go back to the fucking drawing board...again.
---
At this pace we'll have this feature next year....bugged.
---
They are really rare. I mostly find them in Harper's Ferry.
---
Definitely loving the sound of the ammo factory, my 50 cal is a hungry beast and I've had to switch to a UGL while I rebuild the gunpowder/acid stockpiles.
---
Being able to boost luck might be nice as I've started using food more but it just spoils so quickly so it's pointless having large amounts of raw materials on hand without it.
---
It does sound like it's going to be one hell of a grind to get there though. I'm chasing 240 right now and I bet whatever resources that generates in the new system wont go far.
---
I want to roll a BOS Incel with one massive forearm
---
You still need help?
---
Needing to be that high level to make proper use of these cards is abysmal, and the only players that high are cheaters who abused the god mode glitch!
---
Here is a direct link to tweet.
---
https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1278728339780485120?s=20
---
Here i was excited to grind to level 300 to unlock all the card slots... my headcanon is gonna be thats where the level cap is lol
---
That is odd indeed. Never heard of this happening before.
---
Why not sleep and do this in 160 hours?
---
I hope so, but yeah, I don't really believe they will introduce anything well thought out and convenient to use even after 3 years of development.
---
What exactly do you mean ?
---
The ability to craft higher level mods ? ( I have not crafter a weapon for a long time )  
---
or  
---
that guns are breaking slower ? ( This should work as intended, but I ll check it when I get home )  
---
!!! Important !!!  
---
I am not sure about two shot prefix, but explosive weapons ( explosive legendary effect ) do eat duriability much much much more than regular w/o explosive perk.
---
Exactly...
---
Can't seem to find anything called a jumpsuit camo, but I did stumble upon a [forrest camo jumpsuit](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanic_jumpsuit_(Fallout_76))that is just a variant of the Mechanic Jumpsuit.  According to this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4hzzijHzwQ), it's a rare drop from forest events and possibly forest clothing spawns.
---
The trailer showed them doing this, but no its two seperate items now.
---
if you're willing to accept you might lose stuff then just put the stuff in a random world container. take a note of several players in that world. Then leave. Swap to an alt. Find that person and join their game.
---
Yeah, very odd.   Geez, I hope it's just UI and there when I log back in.
---
I thought I saw that people were saying the durability was broken but it could just be people using tse weapons
---
Really fantastic attention to detail. Sad I can't see it in person, on PS4. This game needs more builders like you OP!
---
Strange. I've never heard of that happening. Well not since the vendor/stash glitches that were patched. 
---
My thinking was that you were at 9k when they purchased, but there was no UI prompt. Then you checked and saw 17k and after you checked the UI procced, making it look like you got nothing.
---
Out of interest are you using any CAMP budget glitches? Some people have been saying that this can cause odd bugs with vendors.
---
No it isn't, it's part of a bundle, the free one says something else!
---
clever
---
Thank you for your service.
---
That's correct but speaking as a Heavy Weapons main (that doesn't use Power Armor) it's not so bad those Legendary Ability Perks are going to be useful and I already drafted a build for when these Legendary Perks get implemented.
---
Do you have 30k caps?
---
Nothing for handguns or shotguns either.
---
Deathclaw Gauntlets spawn in that mode? I never found one!
---
Great job! Beth should hire you as a consultant for a season at least.
---
I can't wait for the entire map to be playable. Nothing in this game is scary or risky as it is. If everything is going to die 1 shot, I'd at least like to be able to play the whole map.
---
How did people get into the public test server
---
No, I know I was at 17K because I had specifically looked as in, "Can I sell this for X and not go over the limit" check.  I was going to be okay and hence I listed it.   I \*never\* allow myself to go below 10K, FWIW.  In fact, I'm kinda uncomfortable being below 20K.  
---
No camp glitches being used either.
---
Sounds like you are maxed out. 30000 is the max number of caps. Over that and they fly into nothingness. Spend some!
---
Thank you for sharing
---
[this is the guide you want](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
Ammo Factory - produce 50%/75%/100%/150% more rounds when crafting ammo.
---
Antivenom- +50/+100/+150/+200 poison resist when wearing matching armour
---
Follow Through - Ranged sneak damage increases damage to target by 10%/20%/30%/40% for 10 seconds
---
Legendary Ability - +1/+2/+3/+5 to stat and +1/+2/+3/+5 to available perk slots (one for each SPECIAL)
---
Master Infiltrator - auto unlock skill 0/1/2/3 terminals and locks. +3 Lockpick and Hacking skills.
---
What Rads? - +50/+75/+100/+300 rad resist, restore 1/2/3/6 rads per second.
---
These look like the pick of the bunch. So at level 300 we can have 6 different legendary perks?. I'm assuming each special stat would be a different perk. This means you could take all of the above if you just boost one special stat. 
---
It also means you could boost all (bar one) of your special stats for some very good jack of all trade builds, that in itself would be an end game grind worth persuing for some as you could just about do everything on one character if you wanted.
---
 Sounds like you are maxed out. 30000 is the max number of caps. Over that and they fly into nothingness. Spend some!
---
This is what I actually stated at the end of my post, "now at least there are couple \[perks\] I'd actually consider having in my builds ".
---
I agree that some perks are a way to go, at least the ones that increase number of regular perk slots for more utility. But all this is really redundant considering overall low difficulty of current game's content. What I think is first we need more challenging and replayable content and total gear rebalancing to promote build diversity and viability for endgame stuff. *Only after that* legendary perks that offer even more diversity/firepower/utility would be a welcome addition. As of now, they will only make OP builds even more OP, but they were able to steamroll everything anyway.
---
What a huge letdown that my lvl 200+ character I've played with since the BETA days will only be able to get a lvl 1 Legendary card...
---
I wasn't expecting to max out any Legendary perks iny lifetime, but having access to only the bare minimum the endgame has to effort after almost 2 years is disappointing.
---
Really looking forward to the ‚Äòstars‚Äô wallpaper üòÄ Only 3 more ranks to go üòÅ
---
or make a friend. then it's a lot easier and they just hold the stuff for you or they stay in that world. 
---
I had a pal who i told to stay in a world once. I dumped loads of legendaries in a suitcase. Mostly scrap but a few good ones. Some probably worth 5-6k easily. I logged out. And then swapped to an alt. And then over voice chat he goes 'i was supposed to stay in that world wasn't i?' and i was like '...' 
---
Daft bugger left. if someone was quick enough they would have got a nice surprise if they looked in a suitcase at a train station.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a long term goal for players. They are ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù after all. It‚Äôs not supposed to be something experienced players can Waltz info and be able to max everything.
---
Yeah it's the forest camo sorry for my error, but the important is that isn't legacy
---
You can probably hit that today if you still have a lot of weeklies left. You got this!
---
Bethesda is forcing me to play adventure mode to earn S.C.O.R.E.
---
Thats what I was thinking. Not knocking the achievement though.
---
I think 3 posts is enough about this.
---
Thanks for the words of encouragement üëç
---
You sure? I hope you are right.
---
You can be lv 2000 and still not be able to max them!
---
or auto-completing challenges that award no SCORE
---
This is gonna be great!
---
Seen some massive lag on certain things lately.
---
Finished Radiation Rumble and nothing popped, just went quiet and stopped and I assumed it glitched out.
---
Went on to help a public teammate defend their workshop (purely for XP) and after that finished the Rad Rumble fanfare went of and I was rewarded, this is like 7 or 8 mins later....weird
---
Hell yea man you'd be amazing for that
---
In theory it's a good idea. I think leveled content is just a bad idea in any MMO type game because of how it limits you to only playing in your specific little region that's your level with players that are also your level. The problem is Fallout 76 is still going to be a leveled game. They are just going to try to make it dynamically scale. And we know how silly that can get. Forest ghouls shouldn't be Deathclaw tier just because some high level dude passed through to buy stuff at a vendor.
---
I think the better approach would have been to just remove the damage/resistance penalties from being under an enemies level. So you can still hurt them even with a low level pipe pistol.
---
To roleplay!
---
Up to this point Fallout 76 hasn't had its own Microsoft Store version for PC, which is a prerequisite for Game Pass PC games, so I imagine they just don't have that up and going for the Microsoft Store yet and will come later today probably.
---
Its going to break everything. Just leave it as it is. Please..
---
It's absolutely true, but in that case the system itself is just really bad.
---
If you use Bethesda launcher, press "&gt;&gt;" button above your game selection tab and in the dropdown menu with all games select Fallout 76 PTS. Install it and you're good to go -))
---
Exactly.  I think that was the point.
---
Um... Appalachia was absolutely settled before 1776
---
Why thank you!
---
I think so too
---
You can't fix what almost fully broken.
---
I love 76 but be real Bethesda can't fix game because they need create game from the scratch. 
---
Level-design is broken, game-design is broken, balance is broken, inventory is broken (1st fix that), no chat in game, no mods, no nothing.
---
Really big issue is for comfortable game you need to be 1st or buy second/mule account, and Bethesda not fix that for Fo76.
---
Shit, I'm so used to ignoring them when getting atoms that I didn't even consider that they'd be required to get all the stuff.  
---
I really really don't want to do NW challenges, I'm on PC and it never goes well.
---
would be nice if the markers also appeared when looking through the scope
---
Ok? I don‚Äôt see the problem. There should always be something to work toward. That‚Äôs the entire point of the legendary perk system. It‚Äôs not just something to buff high level players.
---
I think you may get biased opinions here. 
---
I have 1100 hours in the game and still love it. I mostly play by myself. Sort of. There's a new public teams feature which makes finding others to play with easier BUT just because you're in a team with doesn't mean you have to play with them. You get a buff from public teams and people can share perks as well. 
---
It still has problems/bugs. Not gonna lie. Sometimes they fix something or introduce something new and somehow manage to break something else.
---
Most events take less than 15 min but the ones not announced  like leader of the pack, defending a workshop, manhunt etc can be done in about 3 minutes max.
---
And yet the camp is littered with the traditional heads on spikes.  A group is defined by the actions they take, and they behaved like raiders before SB's chased them out and after.
---
Those crappy TSE weapons (TS effect by itself) break twice as fast as it shoots two bullets instead of one. Working as intended. Nothing wrong about Gunsmith.
---
Only cheaters who abuse God mode have ever been able to achieve this level so far, I doubt any normal player will ever reach the levels required to make use of them as is!
---
Thank you for your sacrifice, good sir üôè
---
it is the single best broken game. ever.
---
get it
---
Look at steam reviews. Mostly positive now. It‚Äôs improved a lot since launch.
---
That‚Äôs fair. And my bad, I did misread. 
---
Hell, I‚Äôm not even a ‚Äúmeta build‚Äù now. Melee + tank. With only 30% boost to melee, and 20 strength between under armor, a legendary, and melee, I one shot most trash mobs and are really only on danger of dying from poison and forgetting to stim.
---
The Vault raids, if they weren‚Äôt buggy and broken at first (what drove me away) would‚Äôve been excellent to have public teams and legendary perks for.
---
I won't be able to.  Personal reasons referenced in the last paragraph.
---
Lucky hole is the same other than being full of cultists now.
---
I know, right... Even with my level 476 main (playing since beta as well) it's barely possible to start using these perks...
---
The personal reasons referenced in the last paragraph.  I'm fine.  I can rest and simply enjoy the game as normal now.  I'm grateful for an event like this since it was not time gated which I hate.
---
Yes , many times. It's been in west tek the last few times I went on steel farming runs.
---
Did you never play with Lego or something.
---
Use your imagination to create something unique not a cut and paste from someone else.
---
It took me 9 hours the other day to build my diner and I loved every minute as it was my design.good or bad.
---
I ran PA for first 18 months, then I went to full Vanguard solar armour and haven't looked back. I assume because the game is better without it, they want you to try without and they view it as Nuke Zone gear really? :-)
---
It's been happening since Wastelanders.  Almost 3 months later..
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be something to work toward over years. Sure there may be a small group who has exploited the game, there will always be that group. Don‚Äôt need to remove any challenge or long term goals from other players. I have almost 900 hours in the game now. I like the fact I would still have a long term goal to focus on.
---
It's the difference between 50% and 28.80% damage. Junkies being the better one. AA does 28.80% increased damage only IF the target has enough armor to penetrate.
---
It wasn't, but it helped distract me and was enjoyable.  This not being time gated was the most fun I have had since old workshop PVP was a thing, heh.
---
One under a porch of a house in the northwest corner of the town of Morgantown, too.  Directly north of the high school.
---
Yea right, because no one is one shooting pretty much everything with their bloodied(or any other op builds/weapons) except for boss mobs anyway.
---
&gt; In the end it means you don't really get more powerful as you level up
---
Except you do? You get perks. Means, your crit damage gets better, your total AP gets higher, your melee damage, your accuracy, your armor penetration and a lot more.
---
Too breezy for me.
---
My thoughts:
---
They haven't changed it yet because they are thinking "The new score system will be a great way for us to introduce more legendary coins to characters and more perk card packs so it's all going to work out in season two, so nothing to worry about".
---
If one post on Reddit deserves an up vote it's this one well done my friend üåü
---
It's ok.
---
Yeah, vault raids... I really hope they will introduce at least something good with that "expedition" addon in winter... But before that there seems to be no meaningful endgame additions that would require to push players' limits further beyond getting base set of 1\* unyieldeing armor and 1\* bloodied 50cal/claw/automatic rifle.
---
We got it at the 1st post you made.ok
---
This is an ironic statement and I will not be any more telling or specific than that on the matter.
---
You do not need to fix pipes. When you enter that room, immediately stay left. There is a lvl 3 locked door. Enter there, go through door on right, kill turrets, then unlock lvl 3 terminal right in front of you. It opens doors and bypasses the pipes.
---
Agreed. 
---
That being said the last few generations of kids are from the "Participation trophy" era. Everyone gets one.
---
Hence your down votes.
---
Maybe it is so, I dunno. Anyway, it would be a honor for me if they did offer me a good job :D
---
1500 was an esrimate when golden cards were worth 5. Now it can only be even bigger.
---
That's amazing!  Love to see these camp posts!
---
&gt;but you will be rewarded in kind to the effort you put in. Missed or bugged challenges regardless.
---
except you have to put in significantly more work than someone who hasn't been robbed of their dailies or weeklies for the exact same reward.
---
Quit while u just started trust me
---
This is a bit of a wild shot, but do you have a wireless headset with a setting enabled that makes it turn off/go in standby when not using it? Logically if the main menu is active and the music is playing it shouldn't consider itself inactive (as there is sound playing), but it might be connected to Window's AFK detection when you are not moving mouse or pressing any keys for a little bit.
---
I'm just throwing this in there because I have very rarely (not for a while now though) had similar issues where it seemed to happen just as there was sound in the headset as if it restarted itself.
---
I have Logitech G933 and if the headset is turned off, the audio device disappears (which could explain why it's changed to different device). I turned off the auto-standby and also made sure I have the latest Logitech software, and I don't think I have had the problem after this.
---
It's always a good idea to make sure you have the latest drivers, especially for graphics card and audio devices.
---
I see. You are not the first one to tell me this
---
It's like they are pressing us to play a lot and further. BUT, with new consoles generations coming and far superior game engines being available, how much longer will we get stick to FO76?
---
Would Beth get a fully new engine as an update? Hard to expect. 
---
Don't get me wrong. This is the only game I play...
---
First time going to the Whitespring I ran into the scrotch beast that spawns just south of it and got my ass kicked. So I naturally assumed it was a higher level area. I leveled, got better gear and kicked it's ass. Gave me a sense of achievement.  
---
Made a new character for wastlanders, had a blast running into high level areas to test it out and level faster. 
---
We are going to have less variety because of ,want everything now instant gratification people.
---
I figured as much
---
This list is leagues better than the original.
---
I don't need more DR or explody enemies.
---
So what'll you choose?
---
There was nothing in the latest *Inside the Vault* about it. I suppose they scraped that idea.
---
Also consider that grenades and mines count as weapons. I haven't tried reconciling the map count with the vendor count but generally it is accurate if sometimes disappointing.
---
Not friendly to new players way to buggy toxic community just a shit experienced only reason I still players because I‚Äôm already a high-level and the endgame trust me invest your time into something different some game you‚Äôll actually enjoy.
---
You might be right, yeah. But there's still time for them to make things right, implementing a fair system, that will feel like something rewarding and useful overall. Not a chore/endless grind for little to no benefit at all, that in turn will only be available to the minority of most dedicated players. (or the ones who cheated the most :D)
---
I really like the vault raid. My friend and I did it everyday before the Wastelanders
---
Me too!
---
It size of where you can place the.tent shrunk but it still works
---
Come on man ,years? You can't expect this to be the last game someone plays.  
---
Thre are major games that will dra people away frm f76. One will drag everyone away from anything(cp2077).
---
Getting to level 500 is a "years" goal for a huge portion of the player base.
---
Ive got 800 hours play roughly 2-2.5 hours a day (have taken a break or two) and im sitting at lvl 218. I started a year ago this month.  
---
I wont hit 500 untill this time next year ifni keep at my current rate.
---
I just will say you that I started playing fallout in 1999
---
Good for you. Doesn't change my experiences or observations. Honestly, you do you if it's in a better on Xbox, that's great, but I remember the disdain when the fake leaks about 76 in general being a battle royale, and a lot of genuine 'huh?' when it was announced while the game still had a lot of problems that needed resolving. Time will either prove me wrong or correct anyway.
---
Because it limits the appeal of the cosmetics - if you're in your PA all the time, why would you care about outfits (especially the ones you can buy in the Atomic Shop?)
---
For me, PA is very situation-specific. I can carry more in my regular armor &amp; my SS Armor makes me feel (outside of nuke zones) as tanky as I would be in PA anyway.
---
I only wear PA in Lucky Hole (Excavator for ore) &amp; when I want to find the Wendigo Collossus.
---
Other than that, I don't see the point.
---
I like it.
---
There's enough of a grind that the legendary perk system entails in order to get the perks, it doesn't need to have arbitrary limitations and costs associated with it. It keeps the system to be geared towards building up over the long term without penalizing experimentation.
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you on one thing as well, there is no justifiable game balance reason why the legendary perk system needed costs added for reslotting. There is plenty enough grind just to max out one perk compared to the standard system, there's no need to add a limitation that involves spending a resource. If they want us to have to think about what we slot, they need to figure out a different method if we aren't supposed to hot swap them like normal perks. If we aren't supposed to hot swap them, we as a community need to know WHY that is the case and what the reasoning is.
---
You don‚Äôt have to explain yourself to anyone :)  and congrats. I did something similar in an MMORPG years ago to win a prize. It was insane but fun, honestly.
---
Thanksgiving Display Case, displays 6 items instead of the usual 4 items.
---
Cost like 500-600 atoms, iirc.
---
How can you be so bad at FO76 that you need to stand on a tent.
---
Their goal is that people play for years. I am almost at 2 years myself. This is what lots of MMOs do
---
fair play mate,thats not healthy though. mental health is important.its just a game
---
Seems like it. But you know what they say...
---
Engine. Engine never changes.
---
Just enjoy the game, we are not all toxic, some of us don't mind helping
---
Maxing every single perk is something that should take much longer. People will settle into the perks they want long before that.
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. 
---
(Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. 
---
And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). 
---
You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. 
---
Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. 
---
free states but not free
---
The only part that's account wide is that gives us legendary perk slots to use. But what's the point if you need helluvalot of levels to just upgrade one card to rank 2?..
---
Totally agreed.
---
Nope. Sorry you're afraid of people with different opinions tho. Sucks for you
---
It's a glitch, switching weapons usually fixes it
---
Same,still it's not appropriate. You gotta make a feature that is at least relatable to half the players. Do you only play on your private? Have you seen there is barely anyone above 250 in most servers? It's just out of range.
---
Wait this is truly how it works atm on the pts? 250 levels to fully upgrade a perk! 
---
"Are you for fucking real?" For a hot minute I was getting excited with the new legendary perk changes, but man sod that for a game of marbles. I'll be taking the first rank of the perks I want and calling it a day at that. 
---
Legendary perks should NOT BE ANOTHER BLOODY GRIND, they should be a reward for the players that have put the time in.
---
Who the hell is in charge of this shit? No offense man but you clearly have zero *fun* gaming experience.
---
This isn‚Äôt about what you or I want. You made a statement that nobody asked for it, which is just false. You may not like it. That‚Äôs fine. Other people do. 
---
And there is a difference between the core game being a battle royale and having an optional game made that you don‚Äôt really need to play (a dude just legit completed the season today without exploits). 
---
Also I‚Äôve never waited more than 10 seconds for a match. If you were honestly waiting 20 minutes there is something wrong with your connection. Why didn‚Äôt you do something else rather than sit at a waiting screen for 20 minutes?
---
I have no wireless stuff on my PC but in the settings I have 3 devices for sound output the onboard soundcard Nvidia high def audio, and 2 outputs of my secondary soundcard Soundblaster Z speaker and SPDIF-Out, I used to have an 3rd external soundcard by Steinberg but I lend it to a friend. Maybe it's to much sound for one system?
---
I'll try the driver update maybe this helps 
---
Use the bass on the stairs trick and go underneath, you can do that even in the water and remove it.
---
The majority of players are not on PC.
---
'Funpowder' has got to be the best typo I've ever seen. Do NOT edit üòÅ
---
These are more resources than guides, but here's a good compilation with links to various sources of information. I use many of these regularly.

---
I‚Äôd like if the perk levels were locked behind challenges. Like in order to get all levels you complete different combat or world challenges. This way you can be rewarded with actual gameplay and not just xp grinding. With this system they‚Äôd also have to be level locked so you‚Äôre not level 10 running around with full legendary perks
---
Explore. 
---
you DO NOT need to purchase repair kits. Use junk to repair gear at workbenches. Go to inspect/repair and select workbench repair. It will tell you what components you need. There are perks that allow you to repair gear over 100% which makes workbench repairs the most effective way to repair gear. 
---
Late in the game you will get advanced repair kits from events but I would not worry about that.
---
yeah.. try hunt insects with crossbow or berserk mode in general.  everyone has a chance to challenge himself in his own way.
---
I feel you. Spent all my scrips on legendary modules ever since wastelanders released and have only got one decent weapon so far. Would be better if you could grind scrips, but with a daily cap it sucks
---
gg lad
---
Depends on what you are going to do with all that junk inside of your trunk
---
We do events almost exclusively on private worlds now. We create those event public groups you mentioned too :p we just do that for the SBQ nukes were about to launch. Then we hop private and enjoy encryptid, PP, RR, exp nukes, etc. all without those glitch weapons deleting everything. 1000x more fun. Then we hop back public and do tea time or herder etc :p
---
The sad part for someone like me is feeling like I'll have to either cut myself deeply to participate or ignore legendary perks entirely.
---
I just started understand a month ago.  I like the card collecting aspect and I like build options.  I read it's like 500+ levels to get all the base perk cards, roughly.  I'm just getting level 100 or so.
---
Let's estimate, if I can keep this pace up, maybe getting a "full" collection by the end of the year.  This is sort of a pita because the game actually makes it hard for you to collect all the perk cards in the first place.  I'm going to have to build a spreadsheet or something.  The in game layout is a scrolling mess.  Nothing showing what's missing to get all the perk cards and different levels, but I digress.
---
Assuming by the end of the year my collection is complete.  Now I need to go at least half that again to get 1 legendary perk card.  Then once more, roughly for a second.  So, that puts me around level 1000(?), if I want to keep from scrapping a working collection of perk cards.  The time investment in that is beyond the word grind.
---
The only conclusion I can come to is that I will have to ignore the legendary perk card system for 1 to 2 years with the coin system attached.  And this will be worse for any new players coming in.  The only people being rewarded are the good mode cheaters who got 1000 plus levels already.
---
To that end, the coin system goes against changes like the gold bullion system.  There are cheaters who can hypothetically get any or all legendary cards they want on day one due to having already cheated out the levels they'll need.  I don't want to institute more grind just because of them, but this system punishes regular players and rewards cheaters.  Badly.  This isn't necessarily fixed by the IP level pool based system, but it doesn't punish the rest of the player base simultaneously, and allows more participation across the board.
---
So, tldr,  the coin system punishes players who actually want to participate in the perk card system and collect all the base perks, but rewards the people who cheated to get insane level numbers (and the cards who came with them) already.  It leaves new players or in the cold with an unreachable goal.  The pool system doesn't fix this completely, but it does allow everyone a chance to participate, which is good, since this will be a base system of the game connected to perk cards.
---
Why scrap perk cards at all?  Then the coins?  I guess I'll ignore them completely if it goes this way.  It's just a waste.
---
Looks like there are a bunch of jealous haters on console by my approval numbers.
---
Well you can only do mission stuff in *your* instance of the place either solo or as team leader. Other than that im not sure what bug your having.
---
I don‚Äôt have fallout 1st. All public servers for this wastelander.
---
Fun. I can't find the box for that.
---
Sorry couldn't resist.
---
Why is that date on the top of the map 1776 - 2076 ?
---
Is it bad that I don't know and don't really care?
---
I mean, I'm doing the challenges, and collecting the rewards I earn, but I'm just not seeing the value in most of the rewards to keep track of where I am.
---
thank you very much. This will be a great starting point for me. THankyou so much again
---
Yeah this came in with Patch 20, reset time got moved an hour later.
---
LoL üòÖ
---
Will the discount apply to the legendary modules though?
---
They fixed the last weapon dupe pretty quickly so hopefully the same happens here.  You hate to see it.
---
that is why I buy only legendary modules.
---
I can't help but think that a genuine PSA would announce it's existence and be vague as possible, not link to a video with explicit instruction how to replicate it so we can once again have an extended period of things being disabled or fucked up because you've now made it known to a much larger audience than previously would've been. 
---
You should remove that link and use your head.
---
SMs drop a lot of it :-)
---
&gt;Legendary perks should NOT BE ANOTHER BLOODY GRIND, they should be a reward for the players that have put the time in.
---
Exactly my thoughts, I wholeheartedly agree with ya.
---
&gt; No offense man but you clearly have zero *fun* gaming experience. 
---
I dunno why you mentioned it, but no offense taken. I play the game and have my fair share of fun from it. If I wouldn't, I'd quit already.
---
Anywhere Super Mutants can be killed and looted. I get my daily gunpowder supply at West Tek.
---
Why?  PA already has magic damage and rad resist that no other armor in the game can get close to.  It's OP as it is.     
---
Are people not going to be happy until they can stand in front of an Assaultron beam and smoke a cigarette before having to shoot back or something?
---
I am level 394 in adventure. Never entered NW until the past few days. I hate and royally suck at PVP. However, I am enjoying NW.   I hop in, do the challenge then make it my personal mission to hide!  I have made it all the way to 4th place, without a weapon. I‚Äôm fine with that but it‚Äôs actually fun trying to find new spots to hide.   I consider myself target practice for those who really enjoy the PVP.
---
After playing ARK i don't think anything else, however malformed, can move me. You should see what characters some ppl can come up with.

Or you can make it at chem bench with cloth and acid I believe :-)
---
Super Mutants it is. Thanks for the tip!
---
You can get "improved repair kits" later by defeating scorched queen in"scorched earth event". But if I'm not mistaken you need to make 1000+ damage to get loot from queen, so just tagging with a few bullets doesn't work like other mobs. You can check out this interactive map to find things you looking for if you like: [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)  , also [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorched\_Earth](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorched_Earth) can guide you about items, quests... and [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) can help about  raw materials

I‚Äôm great at hiding. Not tried the outhouses. Thanks for sharing!  Lol
---
Scrap their weapons for Steel too
---
I was an ammo hoarder for a while, until I realized I could min-max my weight by slimming down on the weapons I carried to standardize on as few different types of ammo as possible.
---
For example, I used to carry both a Fixer &amp; a Handmade, until I realized that I only needed on, because carrying both a ton of 5.56 &amp; .45 just didn't make any sense. So, I picked on &amp; put the other up on my wall.
---
What the hell is PTS?
---
Here's a nice compilation of some very useful links - especially where to find different junk, and where/how to get plans for stuff.
---

Now that you‚Äôre in ammo-making mode I‚Äôd recommend the Agility perk Ammosmith for a higher yield and the Luck perk Super Duper to get a random second batch.
---
Despair?
---
That was meant for the person in charge of the decision to do this, not you mate. I fully agree with what you've written.
---
We are all maxed on caps
---
Bethesda: sounds great. How much budget should it take up?
---
Devs: not much, they dont have much budget as os.
---
Bethesda: coll, 95% it is
---
That's really usefull. Thanks again!
---
Farm west tek and huntersville locations. Super mutants drop it regularly, as well as good weapons to scrap for the steel to craft ammo too (use scrapper perk). 
---
Though you can also craft gunpowder at a chemist bench using cloth and acid which are also easy to come by.
---
Acid, cloth and the perk card super duper
---
You don't need to do them to reach the gold star challenge. I never bothered with nw before the legendary run, but now that I played a few matches, it was a nice exercise and distraction. I'm still not a fan of this mode and I certainly will not grind to lvl 100, but I don't mind the challenges.
---
So basically, by neglating a max level cap to players right at the start, they are now cobbling together something in the hopes it'll maintain challenge to players, instead of producing new higher level zones?  
---
At time goes on, I feel less inclined to play and go back to FO4.
---
Man, I've seen you around more than I'd like, and when you don't like something it's always the same. I'm not going to humour you when every post is basically a condescending attempt at ""correction"" with barely veiled disdain. Grow up dude.
---
I mostly use the Final Word and even though it uses a small portion of my ammo relatively, eating up thousands of rounds makes me want to have a backup.
---
so it seems an unarmed build with these perks makes a 70% chance to explode if you stack the perks.
---
U r making this post to show off and make clear that u r pretty crazy person imho.
---
Well, my personal cut-off for ammo that still has weight with Bandolier is 30,000 rounds, but hey, it's your carry weight. There is, on the other hand, no such thing as too much .45 or 5mm.
---
Public Test Server. You can play it for free if you own the PC version of the game.
---
You say this as if we have any say on the matter. 
---
We could give Bethesda nothing but requests for fixes until the end of time and they'll keep doing what they're doing - releasing new content (especially anything that's tied to revenue) and take things really slow with crucial fixes we're been asking for since launch.
---
Maybe it's time to face facts that this is just how Bethesda is. There are some things that they do well. There are even brief flashes of brilliance and talent but for the most part, they really don't care about prioritising bugs or making the game any more stable than it is. If they did care, it would have happened many months ago.
---
Just don't do them. It's THAT easy!
---
Thanks for this! I wasnt interested in any Perk except the below avaerage fusion core one for I am playing in PA Only.
---
Are there any new Perks that a PA User can profit from?
---
Well, you can be both a Heavy Weapons &amp; Rifle Build (since HW perks are in Strength &amp; Rifle is in Perception) - that's what I do. 
---
I currently have an LMG / Gauss Mini as my dual heavy weapons &amp; the Handmade as my everyday weapon.
---
I like the Flatwoods Fletcher skin. Being a bow Archer is certainly fun in the lower level regions and saves me precious ammo.
---
I'd say, just enough ...(for a few days).
---
**Keep going!** 
---
*( I think I went through something like 12k yesterday ... I just wanted to see and do Wendigo Collosus before i go for SBQ :D That cost me like 5k alone, the rest was just fooling around. )*
---
There just seems to be such a major disconnect with bethesda and the community.  It feels like they want to cause us major inconvenience sometimes.
---
Ammo factory will be a godsend with crafting 2mm for the gauss minigun and .308 for the lmg
---
It's like any mechanic that could be perceived as favoring the player is either shot down or turned into something designed to try to keep people in game as long as possible.
---
I get trying to promote some balance, and this system is meant to be long term and you work for it. However, I'm in favor for things like this to follow the Mantra of "if everything is OP, nothing is". Have me stand in awe when I see a level 300 character and imagine what he may be powerful at. Instead, in game it's almost like all the different ways we can be strong, whether that's combat, sneaking, crafting, etc. kinda feels equalized, as opposed to letting anyone be REALLY good at something, while at the same time not having it take 5 months of grinding to get to that point.
---
Completely disagree with the time frame it should take.  Also consider that means grinding on ONE character and not trying new builds. Beth even said one of the reasons they are doing these new perks is to encourage people to try new builds. And no one is going to wanna do that if they gotta put crazy time I n all n over again.
---
Long time goals are great if theyre are reasonable. But having to put what 5k+hours (to get over level 1500) in one character is absurd. No one but exploiters and people that play 18 hours a day will get there.
---
But youre entitled to your own opinion. Agree to disagree i guess.
---
No you don't need to spend real money at all and don't. At least give yourself to understand how to play the game before spending any cash. I have been playing since the beta and yet to spend any real money.
---
First decide on your built, this is important as you could max out a perk category and then make some wrong decisions. For instance, I recommend building up strength, but if you don't assign enough points you can get into trouble at least it would be inconvenient.
---
Work to get to level 15, at level 15 you can get some Raider PA to help with some of the tougher enemies, you don't have to be a PA player if you don't want, it's a tool and PA fits in your pocket so you pull it out when you need. In the mean time find an empty frame, it gives you 10+ strength even without the pieces. 
---
Work on doing your daily and weekly challenges to get thru the season pass, each day you don't do this, makes it less likely at this point to hit 100.
---
Enjoy the game, it's a fun game and I still play daily ..
---
My bloodied 50cal will eat a few thousand rounds a day for my 1-2 hours a day of playtime
---
Don't feed the troll.
---
I love power armor imo. I'm lvl 150 and I run a junkies power armor heavy gun build and its really fun. Cos power armor is like fallout's unique feature and I love it
---
Honestly, all they needed to do was copy the champion points system from ESO and rename it.
---
Everyone who's a fan knows this.  
---
Considering China the real world seems to be mimicking the game.
---
What the hell is up with Bethesda's obsession with explosions? 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love that they actually put a little bit of thought into giving some actually useful perks but we STILL have to many exploding ones.
---
Yes. If there was a dedicated raid team option I would definitely do it, since I never did it before as a solo player.
---
I think ive seen less than a dozen people over 500, most are 100 or 200, with a few 300s.
---
Why not wait until the end?
---
You may be able to grind all 100 levels without having to spend atoms. No one really knows how long it takes yet

Okay. Sorry to hear it. Feels shitty but at least caps are pretty easy to come by.
---
I get it.  
---
Sadly, BGS has had the SAME engine for Fallout for too long. If anything they sould have delayed 76 created a new engine with the basic concepts from Fallout 3+  and implemented them into the new one.  
---
I wouldn't spend too much time on how the character looks initially but you could spend hours tweaking him/her how you are describing things.
---
Oh, I see now -))
---
I will one day fill an entire alt character‚Äôs stash with ammo so I will NEVER run out.
---
Thanks everyone! This community is just the best!
---
If you fast travel to Summersville, the first house on your right has almost 200 burnt books Ina very small area for cloth
---
If you go to the Flooded Trainyard you can server hop and kill the snallygasters repeatedly for acid, about 6 per creature
---
_
---
For lead head to Lucky Hole Mine with a suit of excavator armour
---
Getting all the Lead nodes will get you 400-500 Lead ore, smelt it with super duper
---
Wow someone is really butt hurt here! Did someone take a workshop from you? Dang!
---
Don‚Äôt listen to this guy. It‚Äôs a great community. There are some bad apples but MOST of us help people and have a great time!
---
I am level 326 and have ranked up 8 times in the last week with the new teams.  I have not picked any perk cards with those ranks and will save them for when this comes active in a couple of months.  I expect by that time I will have another 50 perk cards to scrap and level up for the ammo and infiltrator perks.
---
Bow! It's a good weapon for lower levels and new content from wastelanders. Definitely more fun to use than crossbow.
---
It‚Äôs as soon as my character loads into the game, I don‚Äôt even have a chance to move the controls.
---
Snallyghasters, Yao Guai, Crickets - all drop acid (5+), and I never ever really needed to farm for cloth. With Super Duper much better yield than farming for pure Gunpowder from SM's ... 200-300 acid can be easily turned into 900+ gunpowder (not sure about the ratio ATM but you get 15 out of each craft, and a 30% chance to get 15 more )
---
Flooded trainyard has a bunch of snally, and Tanagra Town has Crickets inside (go up and get into the cave that is on the way up to the house)..., these two easily get you 100-150 acid each time.
---
Hanging raider cage cause it looks cool.
---
I was excited about the Dark Mater paint but it does not work on fixers so disappointed.
---
Literally nothing else.
---
As someone who is currently using 3 - 6 slots for lockpicking / hacking depending on what I have equipped, Master Infiltrator is an absolute must-have and first purchase.
---
Then Ammo Factory because my god I go through shotgun shells so quick.
---
Maybe Follow Through and What Rads? after that.
---
Lmao exactly what I‚Äôm taking about actually no I play with atmosphere if u know who that is all we do is bully ppl it‚Äôs a shit community like I said look him up on yt I‚Äôd clap u so relax
---
Sadly, no. Still no love for PA users like at all. Currently there are no legendary perks that really benefit PA playstyle to at least make it on par with strongest non-PA builds.
---
Theres a lot of us who dont care about our camps and just move them willy-nilly as needed. Even after 100+ hours of play, my camp is nothing but a circle of turrets and some crafting benches currently residing atop a very tall and inaccessible cliff in Savage Divide. I move it move it from time to time. And i at least would have no qualms using it to "adjust" the spawns.
---
If you're playing automatic (Commando) - you need to use Powerful Automatic Receiver to work on those perks.   
---
What level are you?  Do you have mods unlocked?  If not, it's a loooong journey with the Handmade.  I built / scrapped about 40 of them before unlocking the mods I wanted.
---
I'll miss going to low areas and one punch everything to death.
---
I hope they do *something* with the vaults tho.
---
After about 50 hours, you get desensitized to it
---
The bad thing is I have got plenty of nice unyielding, but don‚Äôt play a bloodied build, so it is useless to me. I can‚Äôt trade it. It just goes in my stash until it eventually gets turned into scrip once I get rid of the other 200 legendary items.
---
Things to know is that you shouldn't play too seriously or else the game will get extremely grindy late game. 
---
Take your time with events/the main story focus on figuring out what kind of game play you like. 
---
Gear you find is usually close to your level. So you won't find high gear off the bat. After 50 is basically end game so you got a while from beginning to go .
---
Noises got old after 5 minutes for me. I put mine on a switch and built 1 regular vending machine so I can still use that to show on the map for other players.
---
It‚Äôs just a costume idea that‚Äôs all , there‚Äôs loads of funky stuff that‚Äôs come and gone in the shop , no one is making you wear it , I just think a fancy royalty pack would be cool with the addition on chandeliers , fancy stairs , pattern wallpaper and marble floors ... make things look classy like in whitespring ... it‚Äôs not an unusual idea ... Whitespring have loads of decor that‚Äôs not available in build mode , the king and queens costumes would be like fancy dress Re-enactment much like the civil war outfits .
---
I have a load out for when I'm out of PA solo and on a team, one for when I'm in PA solo and on a team, and  2 different types of camp loadouts, one for armor stuff and one for weapon stuff. One for being overencumbered, and the rest are just random stuff I've used. Oh and also one for trading, lockpicking, and hacking.
---
Let me guess anti-venom won't work in PA making already less useful than a way to drain fusion cores
---
Upvote for fellow wastelander father.
---
Can't say I have. I hear a lot people talk about crashes but it very rarely ever happens to me. I'm more likely to get booted from the server or stuck in the map.
---
This may not make you feel any better, but I‚Äôve learned that anytime I build something elaborate, it‚Äôs still better looking and usually more budget-efficient the next time. I‚Äôve built these ‚Äútiny towns‚Äù a half dozen times and thought my first one was brilliant. Now it seems like a child designed it :)
---
I don't know I kinda like it, the matte-ness of it is kinda appealing as opposed to the reflectiveness of the others, and it at least looks unique comparatively, I could easily mistake an Elder's armor for a Paladin or Officer if I couldn't see the arm rank.  But different strokes for different folks I suppose :)
---
I did every challenge available back when they went toward atoms. I agree with the other poster that the fact that it is time gated Is bullshit because I know for a fact not all of my friends are into daily challenges. I am hoping to make it to at least level 80-85 and I might at my current trajectory, I‚Äôve been doing the nuclear winter ones too for an extra boost
---
I've been doing the same thing, and any challenge that I think will take too long I skip (like revive a player 3 times). If it takes more time to do the one NW daily than to do all the Adventure dailies I figure its not worth my time. Better to just run West Tek, Scorchbeast Queen and what not, get the SCORE from XP, and get useful rewards/scrap/caps, etc.
---
Ur usin it wrong.
---
You will clap me? Are you drunk? Also, please you a ‚Äú.‚Äù now and then. It‚Äôs difficult to understand your typing and run-on sentence.
---
Yeah as a shotgun build when I farm Morgantown HS for plastic I just melee the Scorched there. Can't do that if they're the same level as current Watoga HS ghouls.
---
i would of preferred them bringing back the survival servers and giving us challenges to survive there. vs NW. the game mode is just boring. lackluster and my stats are set for PVE i'm not rearranging all my perk points just for that.
---
How about this I'll just show you instead:

---
For context I use a Full Health Build but now for the explanation:
---
- Perception is at 3 right now but it's getting bumped down to 1 once I obtain Master Infiltrator.
---
- I'm using Legendary Ability Charisma to increase Charisma by 5 Points
---
- I'm using Legendary Ability Agility to increase Agility by 5 Points
---
- I'm using Legendary Ability Luck to increase Luck by 5 Points
---
- I'm picking Survival Shortcut because that's an easier way top off on food and Water for Rejuvenated
---
- What Rads? will be my main 6th Legendary but it will get swapt in or out as needed for Ammo Factory whenever I'm crafting ammo
---
At least they confirmed that, while Colossal Problem is slated for patch 21, legendary perks were pushed out even further to tentatively patch 22 so they can iterate more on the feature, so hopefully they listen.
---
Oh okay, so it's not some alternate version as my head suggested. Good to know.
---
Yeah, I noticed that also.  That one seems to stay consistent from server to server.  The workshop icons seem to keep changing when I change servers.
---
May I ask what this is about? I've been away for a while.
---
It makes me think for a split second what a pathetic consumer I am that I continue to dump time and money into something so broken but then I re-load the game back up grind more XP so I guess I'm just a rat :(
---
Sigh. Thanks anyhow.
---
I guess I have some little hope for the Brotherhood Quest to boost PA in some way shape or form. They (We) love Power Armor, If they cant bring something to the Table I guess PA is doomed to stay on above-wood-armor Level..... and even full Unyuilding Wood is better than PA huh. Kinda Depressing.
---
you are not being forced to play anything. not fallout 76, not nuclear winter. this take is so pathetic.
---
It‚Äôs cool I appreciate the discussion! While debating on what to do, I realized if my camp was shifted like 10 feet a different way I‚Äôd have more freedom to slightly change things in my camp. I‚Äôm not sure yet. For now I have a dock in my pond.
---
Can confirm.
---
Also, before I started crafting Ammo too, I had like 10k steel scrap...
---
Now I run out every day - so scrapping weapons from mutants is a good idea too, plus you get the extra gunpowder. Also wave events are a great source for scrap weapons - personally I like Line in the Sand the most. Also don't forget to Always scrap with "Scrapper" perk card.
---
No idea what build you run so how much ammo would you go through daily, I personally need 5-10k .50cal a day :) But I still manage, and I try to start and end each play with approx. 12k ammo in my inventory.
---
This is a great idea and could work! Underground water is funny though, sometimes you‚Äôre in water and you can‚Äôt see it, and sometimes small bodies of water seem to stretch endlessly down there. I‚Äôd still give it a shot, could be an easy fix.
---
I burned through a crap ton a week ago trying to get a good combo of SS armor and it was hit and miss.  Now I‚Äôm almost back to 1000 so I guess now is as good as time as any to piss away more scrip
---
Fallout wiki - ‚ÄúThe migration began in the 18th century, with immigrants pushing into the Appalachians. The immigrants came from a number of countries, including Ulster-Scots, Germans, English, and others.‚Äù
---
You're gonna have to be a bit more explicit here my man. 
---
Was it your camp? someone else's? Are you still over the legit build limit? I've heard that if you are it's still possible.
---
It's honestly pointless to speculate on why they were removed.  They don't do nearly enough developer input on the changes in the PTS.  When you look at the information the players are provided in the PTS of other MORPG games it's actually kind of embarrassing.
---
Wait that's today. Yesssssss. Can't wait ti get home and finally try for a legendary combat shotgun
---
I would love if it was changed, especially if it was global between all characters since I am an alt-alholic and really don't \*want\* to do the grind on 5 characters. 
---
I'm also worried about lunchboxes.  A group of 4 players stacking lunchboxes effectively doubles your XP (or alternatively, cuts down the time to level by 1/2). We see them, in limited supply, in the SCORE system.  I have no doubt they will be sold on the atom shop soon, and since it gives a bonus to everyone around them, it might seem less "bad" since the atoms one player spends benefits multiple people.
---
To further their thinking, that bonus XP basically cuts the time down by as much as 1/2 to get to the same point.  
---
Unforuntately, this might be the plan - heavily encourage players to buy lunchboxes to make the grind more reasonable.  As it is, the lunchboxes are making getting the repeatable 10K SCORE challenge more reasonable.
---
Hmmm looks like the respawn at 76 upon death issue again...
---
Nah turn that shit up fam
---
I for one am totally fine with the rewards. Of course there‚Äôs some filler but there is a lot of cool stuff. I was honestly surprised when I saw all the neat new items because like you said, a lot of this stuff would go up in the atom shop for 400-1800 atoms. I‚Äôm really happy with the potential rewards and I fukken absolutely need the chicken coop and blood eagle handmade skin. Most of the stuff above that aside from the fireplace wall isn‚Äôt as important to me
---
They prob gonna fix this as subscription
---
Really Really cool!!

oh yes, please. i didnt get them, saving my little amount of atoms on something i really want.

yesterday i came across a camp on the gold course and saw the machine. so of course i wanted to have a closer look at it. the moment that thing began to rattle, i nearly shat myself. its a long time, i got surprised like that. i will call it the machine from hell from now on.
---
okay
---
Honestly, the ammo converter was the only thing i was the slightest bit interested in. Its been discussed to death and everyone knows whats wrong with it, but its still possible that Bethesda might do something about it. But i wont plan on that occurring.
---
Skins and content is extremely lackluster. The Ranger armors look like shite in comparison to the original NV ones. Survival tent, scrap box and private worlds are too good on the other hand. The first two should've been available for everyone, they are essential for smoother gameplay.
---
Nice work, out of curiosity what was the levelling comp you won?
---
I‚Äôve gotten some decent drops from the purveyor (namely QE harpoon and bloodied FFR gamma gun) and a couple of FFR Fixers but in almost every situation it was at full price (100).  In fact, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve landed one decent roll since the purveyor came about when it‚Äôs been discounted.  Certainly not with the mystery pick bullshit.   That‚Äôs a complete joke.

This is why we're all here today -)) To make a difference and let them know we won't tolerate such poorly conceived design decisions for the game we love.
---
It goes from "FOR FUCK SAKES" to "Oh Bethesda.."
---
Ive been disconnected but i also keep getting dropped in forza and warframe so...
---
What are you talking about?  This has nothing to do with camp budgets.. It's glitching NPC vendors to dupe....
---
If FO76 had a legit faction system where you join the faction and off you go. Another way to build rep and nuke other players. And players can choose to be neutral by staying a vault dweller. Imagine being BOS or enclave melting Raider or foundation faction member players. Would be great.
---
Read the other post too about how to level up the most.
---
You know what, it‚Äôs just too much hassle. I‚Äôm not changing my build around, not changing my perks around, not switching to a bloodied build that everyone else uses. I just wouldn‚Äôt find doing any of that fun.
---
Congrats to you though. I‚Äôll probably just buy the later levels.
---
Agreed
---
Yeah it's happening.. You hate to see it.  Hopefully it gets fixed as quickly as the last one.
---
Yes please, we high levels are getting screwd cause you cant have more then 2 duplicate cards of each, this would be unnaceptable in any other game.
---
I keep the Faschnacht Collectron, a Slocum's Joe vendor, and the Settler Wanderer in my camp. There's a lot of music going on. I'm not sure if I like the music, or if it's because I hate people

I don‚Äôt know about a burst of laughter, but I‚Äôve definitely had a good chuckle.
---
Sadly if this is their result after going back to the drawing board once, I'm afraid they aren't going to bother doing it again. It makes me worry for the future a bit.  
---
Side note: I started a new character for my son last night, he DID get the perk card pack in the vault, but I noticed when he leveled up it never showed up. My first thought was "Well there goes five upgrades for legendary perks.." which should never be in anybody's head! I'll be trying to duplicate his character the best I can and rush back to where he was since sadly they will be that important.
---
Thanks, hence my need for clarification. I'm not psychic.
---
If My calculations are correct, that is 160 000 .50 rounds
---
Yeah that would last you a while.... Pics when that happens! Please?
---
Yeah aboutr that, wtf was that change.
---
"We changed golden cards to give same coins"
---
Alright, good change, you just forgot to rebalance the regular cards. Fucking Bethesda.
---
I have the fasnatch collectron wandering around singing his songs, the Slocum Joe bot playing his tune, and the Wanderer constantly talking about some song she wants to write, plus a random settler spawn constantly reminding me if the scorched don't get me, the ferals will. Not to mention the constant hum of the extractor in my basement and the radio playing.
---
Just to make it more fun I even threw a bunch of blinking lights through out the house.

Kinda nice, reminds me of being in the City again.

They should just straight up copy elder scrolls online champion point system. After lvl50 we‚Äôll convert over to PC1 and so forwards  each 10,000 exp = 1 PC while making PC lvls account wife like eso 
---
Each alt that goes over lvl50 will convert over to The account PC 
---
And still allow players to scrap duplicate perk cards for extra PC 
---
Players should also unlock all 5 slots at lvl50 , the grind itself should be on lvling PClvls to upgrade legendary perks ranks
---
You mean everyone in the playerbase besides the 3 players that are level 2000+.

Sure, it might take a while but I‚Äôll try to remember when I do. You know, if I‚Äôm still sane.
---
27 I think
---
I was confused too, but then I realised that Australia is ahead of whatever time zone they use for the road map
---
This literally just happened to me
---
Unless you‚Äôre glitched into a rock wall or using a trick like stacking stairs, there‚Äôs a good reason for that ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. What platform are you on? If Xbox I might be able to help you remove those parts, I‚Äôve seen this message many times.
---
Couldn‚Äôt tell ya. People definitely lived in WV pre revolution.
---
i was disappointed by it, because I was hoping it would work for the compound bow.
---
The only time I‚Äôve had this bug is via playing in someone else‚Äôs private story sections. Otherwise, it sounds like a console problem, as no one I know of has had this issue on PC.
---
No joke.  I just rebuilt my entire camp yesterday because after adding one extra floor tile temporarily, I was unable to remove it. I did some googling, and after following every suggestion, I then had 3 floor tiles and 2 staircases that couldn't be removed. Including a staircase that was clipped through the floor above it.
---
Finally gave up and moved my camp and rebuilt it.
---
I know but it's the 9th everywhere in the world
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
Same. Level scaling is a garbage feature in literally every game it has ever existed in.
---
I‚Äôm on pc but thanks
---
??
---
no, hunter hunted sucks. What people want is open world, no players on map, anywhere, anytime style PvP. not minigame pvp with restrictions, not the 5th best BR either.
---
Technically, with Heart of the Enemy, you can.  8 Scrip at a time.
---
Unless im trying to do something very specific, I just take it for what it is, and stop playing for the day. I go go watch tv or do anything else rlly.
---
Read a history book. There were factories set up in early 1700s.
---
It is? I‚Äôve kinda lost track of time these past few months
---
I guess that‚Äôs true. But on a strictly lore argument, none of these people would be living in anything but a concrete bunker with scorchbeasts flying around!
---
It‚Äôll suck for that L10 player that comes in after the nuke train has been through though.
---
I used to pick it up all the time, but I‚Äôd never use it to craft with. Space became an issue so I ignore it now. I‚Äôm sitting on in 1000 of it still though that I‚Äôll drop. My main ammo is fusion core and ultra cite plasma cartridges anyway which don‚Äôt require gunpowder
---
Survival mode was pretty bad to be honest. If they ditched the leaderboard thing, took all players off the pipboy, and made grouping unavailable then maybe we'd have something.
---
Legendary Perks were supposed to be shared across characters. When did that change?
---
Why do you need to max every single perk?
---
Gauss Rifles need an update to conform with the new line of other Gauss weapons....
---
Just as a note, the NW weekly is extra this week. We had 7 last week and 8 this week. So missing out on this one isn't hindering your progress based on all the calculations people made when the system came out. With double XP and double SCORE weekends coming most people should be able to skip all NW challenges if they really want to. Hope that helps.
---
Yep, this is the way.
---
Ah, yes, a fellow man of culture, big fucking guns and addiction I see. Same here, I've always run in PA. Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4. It's my fantasy of being a walking tank. I'm a little disappointed in the Legendary Perks for it but at the same time I'm fine as is, ya know? I don't mind if my build is overshadowed by legendary armor effects, it's not like the game is hard.
---
What was the leaderboard about did you get rewards for being top or?
---
Cheating usually is easier
---
Yes im not happy, damage being applied in percentages instead of numbers, is this even an RPG game anymore at this point?
---
not perks and mutations, legendary effects. All guns should function as vanilla weapons in PvP.
---
Exactly! I guess the legendary perk with recharging fusion cores can come in handy. But I think they could've done us better. I'm still on the grind for more t65. 2000 bullion left :/ I'm running t51 atm
---
There is no such thing as too much DAKKA!!
---
One of my chars lives in a treehouse so I‚Äôm pretty hyped for the fireflies lights that‚Äôs gonna look great around the camp and the tree cage looks wild. I‚Äôd LOVE the bundle at 100 (I‚Äôm curious) but if I don‚Äôt get it I‚Äôm not broken hearted about it
---
Loot all the things.
---
Embrace the mutation lifestyle. (Fear the decontamination arches!)
---
Do a bit of research and decide what type of build you want to do before haphazardly buying perks cards while you level. Power armor/stealth. Heavy guns, shotguns, commando, melee, low-life, junkies, etc. You *can* start respecing special points once you reach L51, but it requires a level up for each point you want to change. So its best to build correctly as you level.
---
Our concrete bunker opened up after 25 years and forced us out! But no I get you.
---
Np
---
The player economy is fucked now lol. The only thing worth anything anymore is the mostly-untradable buillon gear. RMTers are bundling bffrlvc fixers in bundles of ten on console, that's how bad it is
---
i'm rocking the single action.  If you get a quad with good secondaries, its just over the live of usability.  My fave is a quad with +vats hit, my second is a quad with +limb damage.  i mean, 24 shots of .44 earned it the nickname "Leg Breaker"
---
I also use black powder pistols.  An instigating BP pistol with +limb damage is HILARIOUS, then switch to a quad .44
---
it's very niche.  it's fun.  but it's...not OP by an means.
---
Im usually a pvp player, i like games with pvp, but fallout and BR doesnt go togheter since 90% of the players are hiddding in bushes and the game mode is a snooze fest. i fucking hate NW.
---
Well, they still have time till september with yet another round of PT for patch 22. But I don't really hope for much.
---
I think I encountered that bug too long ago. Guess they never bothered to fix it...
---
UV flairs, to highlight the blood (like in the CSI shows) on the corps of that disappearing legendary just just killed.
---
One that attracts hordes. Build a bunker and defend it like COD zombies.
---
you got put on the minimap so people knew where to find you, but you didnt them.
---
You need just over 3k score per day. At the start 3k would get you almost 3 levels. At the end it will get you 75% of a level. However he is moving 1 space per day. He started 30 levels ahead because there is 70 days in the season. So he will reach the end when the season ends. However if you are doing all the challenges you will slowly and steadily catch up and then pass him.
---
Won't miss it next time
---
I‚Äôm just going by info on fallout wiki , it says that‚Äôs when migration began in game ( not real life ) it‚Äôs just a fancy dress / decor idea to add something different in game , I‚Äôm dying for a lot of the whitespring Decore , some fancy dresses and suits would be cool , nothing wrong with re enactment costumes , would like to dress up in opulence ... Marie Antoinette fighting scorched with a shotgun ... üòÇ
---
oh, you mean the machines are not linked? I had assumed every machine sells the same set of items. and that multiple machines are just so that multiple people can shop at the same time.
---
that's a really weird implementation..... thanks for clearing that up
---
That‚Äôs bullshit
---
That's a good idea. There are numerous other great mechanics they could've borrowed from other games but it seems like they live in a world where their online game is the first one ever with no inspiration to draw from anywhere else.
---
When I leave the game long enough for my screen saver to kick in, the game always locks up and requires a hard reboot of my system (power off/on) to regain control of the Windows system and restart the game.  PC system with latest NVidia driver in place.
---
I have made a list of my materials that I need:
---
35,556 Steel
---
8,889 Lead
---
10,667 Gunpower;
---
2,134 Acid 
---
3,556 Cloth
---
It‚Äôs going to be long and hard, but it‚Äôs something to do.
---
You won the imbecile comment of the week!
---
Most MMOs don't require you to grind for years to see *any* benefit, however. But here? If it's going to take 100+ coins just to rank up *one* card, that could be several *months* of playtime for any average player, with *no* discernible benefit - just your coins total slooowly ticking upwards until you *finally* have enough to actually do something with them.
---
they need to satisfy their corporate overlords, so they need to seem to be doing something for NW
---
We have OpenMW for that now.
---
As a newish player, I agree with this. I've been taking it very slowly and just enjoying the world and exploring and picking through ruins for stuff that sounds good. Been collecting things that I feel like I'd want in my camp too, like a couple of sets of crockery and cooking pots and spare clothes, even if there's no way to really use them and a more devoted player would either break them down for resources or never pick them up.
---
There's quite a lot to the game and more to come. Don't fret too much about rushing to the end or being efficient. Smell the roses.
---
Yeah, i have 2 days after update 20 where I couldn't sign in and my game would just crash, ive gone through every emotion from angry, contempt and even happy that I have an excuse to okay something else.
---
Yea but arnt the legendary perks account wise not character based?  So you dont have to get 1 toon to 1500 or 2000 you can break it up into multiple characters right? I have 3 currently add all there levs and I'm nearing 500. If I miss read somthing it be cool if yall could confirm this
---
Horrible system imo but better then the current one
---
It should be exp base like in eso , every post lvl50 lvls for Perk coins lvl and reward PC each 10k exp
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm...not great at NW. Apologies to the team I was on last night, filled with hardcore Bush Wookiee‚Äôs. But the matches themselves are somewhere between annoying and OK fun, and I‚Äôm mostly dead in 15 minutes, so they don‚Äôt take long.
---
But the matchmaking and loading is usually another 15 minutes. As an example, doing the ‚Äúpick three locks‚Äù NW challenge, assuming I found one lock a round, that‚Äôs 90 minutes of NW to pick three locks. Or I could play Adventure and get the XP repeatable instead.
---
It‚Äôs a shame, because you know what, NW is fine for 15 minutes! But the time between rounds is agonising.
---
Sure does, but outside of crafting weapons, I find that repair kits from the queen and occasionally a repair from weapon artisan is more useful.
---
yup, i hate levelled enemy systems. it defeats the whole point of a RPG, where you're supposed to grow stronger in order to explore higher level areas.
---
This is why they struggle. They've never actually had to go back through and fix bugs. They let modders do that for essentially all of their previous games. Having to do upkeep, consistent updates etc is probably not something they considered and due to modding not being available, they're struggling I think.
---
That's not enough cores, I walk around with 100 daily...
---
Singlehandidly killed the whole mode for me.
---
Good job, but please don‚Äôt do this next season lol. It can not be good for you. Please go take a long nap now.
---
Apparently the red asylum worker uniform is stupidly valuable. Ive heard a couple people talking about them.
---
And the only thing we can do is to speak up to not let something like that to end up in this game for all players' sake...
---
kinda- there is still the fact that its better to go without PA due to ridiculous stats, HIGHER carry weight, non-PA jetpack and now poison resistance
---
Wow, around 7 million XP per day?
---
Angryturtle's video about "poweramor cuts damage in half" ... is it obsolete or what?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh0YYDb-FYY&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh0YYDb-FYY&amp;feature=youtu.be) 
---
Or everyone only cares about the unyielding bonus, the perks around it and stuff like that....
---
Me no entender (sorry about my english)
---
I agree with you 100% but not EVERYTHING shouldn‚Äôt be this difficult to have access to for 90% of the playerbase 
---
You can‚Äôt sustain a business with only making content for 10% of the playerbase
---
1700s is the 18th century üòÇ
---
"PA builds complaining" and they still didn't fix the PA perks/left PA out of some p good perks lol ok
---
Part of the nice thing about junkies is running with drugs on when you need them and not worrying about addiction with duration boosts i can run overdrive/pscychobuff for 8min each use which gives a yuge boost especially for melee at a very low cost.
---
chance to explode... why does this matter if they are already dead? does the explosion mean area damage?
---
None of the legendary perks available as they are right now sound like anything I would want to waste my time on.
---
If you want the forest camo jumpsuit it's from events in the forest area, very low drop rate though.
---
You won't see that happen until they break Bloodied or Junkies, then this sub will tear down the rafters until it's fixed.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
While part of me agrees, if ALL they did was fix bugs, we wouldn't get new content. No new content means fewer players sticking with the game during content draught. Fewer players means fewer players reporting bugs and keeping the population up. Lower population means less resources for the dev team to be able to afford to only fix bugs.
---
As much as the game needs game breaking bugs fixed, saying that we should get no new content and that they should focus solely on bug fixing can have the same negative effect if not mitigated properly.
---
If they stop "forcing" NW on players, I'll bet bushwookies will also go extinct.
---
Just to be clear, you can select and use the first ranks of any perks you want, and at 200 you'll have 3 or 4 (I think) slots.
---
üòÅ
---
the queen needs space to land, so when you stand on certain spots and she's aggro-ed onto you, she will NEVER land.
---
tent perching is one of them, standing in between chain linked fences and on top of barriers tends to block her landing.
---
just stand in the open ground when fighting the queen, it's not that hard, she doesn't even do that much damage
---
They stated the whole legendary perk system is base off eso champion point system and even the one wasteland update is base off one tamiral Update on eso 
---
But they half ass it copy it , eso champion point system is very successful idk they ain‚Äôt just copy a successful system
---
Unpopular opinion: the economy was always bad.
---
rip üç∫
---
You arent being forced to play game modes you dont enjoy.
---
This post was bought to you by,
---
"Well it's fine just *uSe Bl00dIeD*" Inc
---
And thus is the problem, the community fixes all their products!
---
Right! Because this game has no other issues and the dev's have nothing better to do.
---
No you need to level up cards on each character, yes slots are unlocked for all, but the cards do not stay levelled up for all characters.
---
For better or worse, No. I've never had the game crash my PC.
---
You don‚Äôt even play the fuckin mode, for the love of god I hope they don‚Äôt listen to posts like this one. Speak for yourself.
---
Next level trap camps, literally and otherwise
---
I just wish it would extend the perk card limit beyond 15 points.
---
Bethesda: Here you go, it uses 50% of your budget, have fun!
---
No, they arent. You are choosing to climb onto that treadmill to get virtual items worth precisely fuckall and that will be replaced in a week or two.
---
Yeah I don't understand how the raiders ammo machine will appear to make 200 rounds of 5.56 in like 20 mins but will take hours to make 200 rounds of .45. I can finally stop buying ammo from people.
---
You're not wrong, but things had value and there was an easily accessible player backed currency in 5.56
---
Damn bro if you were planning on the grind , you should have waited for the double score weekend...  prob would have done it in 30-40hours instead of 81
---
Personally, I think the recharging core is a dud perk with how easily you can farm them from power plants. Sprinting one is okay but I think the legendary perk points will come in handy to better fine tune our build. Keep it up, you're almost there! I'll be able to get the jet pack today and then all that's left is the mods for it.
---
TS is low tier (and really bad prefix) while junkies is top tier (2nd best in the game atm).
---
Takes away the feeling of progression and work you've put in. 
---
I hope I'm wrong about it but I have little faith. 
---
Much like SBMM it just seems like it punishes long term players who are just looking to play deliberately but still casually. 
---
Seems like a low level pander?
---
What makes it that much better though if it‚Äôs a 4 damage difference?
---
The M in M 76 stands for Masket now
---
They will probably do what they did a long time ago. Remove them all from players inventories except for 1.

So if you have 20 B2525 fixers you‚Äôll log in one day and only have 1

good luck. my quest is broken and i cannot complete the final mission. stuck on 'talk to her' back at camp.
---
complaint/support log got me nothing.
---
Exactly that... have you tried turning off screensaver completely? I'll try this out maybe that's the way to go.
---
Why do you dump money into it? It's free now, no? I feel your struggles though. I can absolutely relate to thi
---
Nah, fuck ‚Äúpoor devs‚Äù. They‚Äôre doing a subpar job on purpose, at this point. They have to be.
---
5.56 is what made it worse. It was manageable before people forced 5.56 as a currency instead of a secondary payment to prevent character hopping like it was intended to be used.
---
It‚Äôs what plants crave!
---
Sounds like they have the same person who designed the ammo converter working on this.  Just stop with the menu grind.  You do not need to introduce challenge to the act of specing a character or managing inventory.   It's not gameplay.
---
So far they seem way overly concerned with forcing level grinding, too, which would be fine I guess if the game had any non-exploit ways to get reasonably large amounts of xp.
---
It‚Äôs public at this point. Yes it‚Äôs a verified dupe glitch that has been active since the patch.
---
my favorite was winning without killing anyone.  merlock hunter killed the other guy for me.
---
I would like another Valentine's Day Dupe Massacre but I don't think it's gonna happen, the community was p upset about it but it was mostly a vocal minority
---
Aww lucky. I've been lazy with the bullion lately I probably could've had t65 by now
---
The Steel Mill PA helmet might be what you're looking for.
---
I'm not sure, but I think it has a slit-visor.
---
We buy a fuck ton of atoms unfortunately.
---
I sense a difficulty increase coming. We're already OP and melting through enemies like it's on easy mode, these cards will just make it that much easier. I bet we'll start to see enemy levels over 100 and all enemies will get stronger across the board. We're gonna need that ammo factory for sure.
---
No, not that many crashes on xbox.
---
Where do you find the wanderer? All I have is this raider punk who says the same annoyong BS all day
---
Somebody call the WAAAAAHHHHmbulance lol
---
Please take the time to pick up a history book yourself... or google it ... I can assure you I‚Äôm correct
---
Why is everything *new* in this game 'get some coin and buy it' and not 'do something cool for it'?
---
Legendary perks would've been a nice reward for completing difficult content. Let the level ups take care of unlocking the slot, and doing the content how you acquire the perks. Let a legendary perk pack be a reward at the end. Since Bethesda seems to enjoy RNG, I'm surprised this wasn't their first thought.
---
You can already steamroll just about everything in this game. There's no reason to grind *again.* I'd rather have a reason to want this outside of wanting everything I punch to blow up.
---
This goes even beyond that however. With OpenMW we can now truly exceed vanilla's limits.
---
I'm disappointed the system exists at all. Only thing in it I even remotely care about is the ammo converter and even then I'm in no hurry to grind for one.
---
I think it was assassinchad and some numbers after it,  I can‚Äôt remember fully but maybe assassinchad14 or assassinchad21
---
My guess now that word is spreading fast vendors will be disabled in the next several hours.

Nah I‚Äôm excited about it And can‚Äôt wait

It looks awesome, I just wish it extended the perk cap beyond 15, though.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea actually, if I continue to play NW I‚Äôm going to enable shadow play so I can record my deaths and compile an album as well.
---
New hackers not good. And it looks like a group or a person with multiple accounts. Thx for the info
---
Pretty sure that some of these traders did not have anything considerable before. If the glitch is true, I am honestly done trading and playing this game
---
Worse. There was a more simple ammo converter right in Fallout 3's Pitt expansion. Dump shit in, go to terminal and bulk convert it all into an ammo.
---
That's what money evolves into, it proves how successful it was as a currency. Paper money used to be an IOU for gold. Then we got rid of the gold standard, which was $35 per ounce. Paper backs itself now. 5.56 was an IOU for caps essentially. It later backed itself
---
I have 5 radios posted around my camp to turn on when she starts droning on and on...glad for npc‚Äôs but the dialogue gets stale
---
Thank you for this. Is there a reason this damage is ‚Äúhidden‚Äù and not displayed in the inventory?
---
I have been saying this since Godd Howard shat it out on us at E3. I want totally offline play with the same level of modding I have access to in the other games. 76's biggest flaw is and has always been the fact that its an online game.
---
You‚Äôre welcome man
---
&gt;Coming soon! Ammo crates! To an Atom Store near you!
---
only comes in .38 rounds as that is apparently the one ammo the Bethesda team keeps running out off and thus the players MUST run out of it. thus showing the community once again that Bethesda doesn't play their own game
---
Junkie‚Äôs and Furious are pretty good alternatives for high health builds.
---
Eh. It depends on if I'm solo or not.
---
That's all I want a skin for my combat rifle.
---
They're still trying to make the trem food build a thing?
---
First world problems lol
---
I wouldn't be against this
---
Now? It always has been.
---
Not yet, I imagine Major Nelson or the Game Pass for PC accounts on Twitter will post something when it officially goes live on the Windows Store/PC Game Pass.
---
your right instead of weapons being worth 0 they will be worth 0/0 which might actually be the end of us all
---
Thank you for suggesting a character wide pool. I‚Äôve made five characters, one of whom is level 210ish and the rest are level 50-70. I‚Äôd love for that effort to count towards my legendary perks.
---
You need a stronger team than randoms to do a vault raid well.  You need people who communicate well and an organized approach.
---
Many times. Ive killed him 5-6 times now (I killed the L50 mythical version in cranberry bog last night) as well and he just drops random junk.
---
Inventory numbers work really oddly. If you have addictions and are equipping junkies weapon, it will show you the gained benefit in all your weapons. You have to equip each weapon to show correct numbers.
---
Bruh wtf Bethesda removes my post
---
It would be fine if the made it one way and optional so you could scale down when in a party with a friend, but steamroll through stuff if you're solo, or scale areas up to make them less boring.  Most games that have systems like this don't have ammo though
---
You don't find it there because it's not on the windows store for PC but for xbox.
---
For PC you don't need a Game Pass, you need to buy the game itself.
---
Usually, my reaction to Fallout 76 crashing is surprise, thinking that rarely ever happens, and then being more than a bit worried, since that actually rarely ever happens, so why did it happen now - is my PC broken, and so on.
---
I do read so many comments and threads about people managing to get this game to crash so often, and I'm just at a complete loss as to how they're doing it. I've played it with two different hardware setups now, both on Windows 7 and Windows 10, and it's so very stable for me, compared to a plethora of other games I've played in my time.
---
That's not to say it doesn't crash for other people. I'm just lucky it doesn't do that for me much at all.
---
? They had worth unless you were on pc then rip, but now we got the first console weapon dupe in ages
---
Exactly you can print your own money infinitely. That‚Äôs never a good thing.
---
So it is two shot effect, not explosive, right ?   
---
Thank you sire, I feel enlightened.
---
It‚Äôs not on or through the windows store. PC game pass has its own unique app. Search for game pass in the store instead
---
Yeah camps are bugged AF ... really stupid. I agree with OP this stupid feature should be removed, it has gotten worse over the last 10 updates or so, really not needed.
---
Only the slots are shared not the ranks. And you wont max ever perk. Theres over 15 to max.
---
Wild. Thank you again for taking the time to explain this. I feel much better about my purchase now haha
---
Wrong guess, true high end players like me use legacies, we don't have to be bloodied to do shit ton of damage.
---
Explosive is the same 20% increased damage to every weapons base damage.
---
At the moment they are probably referring to bugged weapons that do massive damage that they shouldn't.  Wouldn't recommend putting much time or effort into finding yourself one as they will supposedly be fixed in an upcoming patch.
---
NGL. This gave me a proper, guttural laugh. Thank you so much for this!
---
Bonus Q: Where can I find those pink neon sign letters so I can write PSA's like this?
---
I would like to scrap some of my perks, I won't mind that part. I do think they need to award points based on levels tho because punishing people for fixing their SPECIAL or switching builds just doesn't fly right.
---
If it was 1 point per level flat and then scrapping cards for extras sounds perfectly fine.
---
It says Legendary Perk Card slots are account wide. Does that mean if I create a new character, trade in all my cards for coins, upgrade the Legendary cards, can my main now use that upgraded card? Can we keep creating new characters to speed up the upgrade process? Or are just the slots account wide and not the actual cards and their ranks?
---
:) np
---
Yup this is me, I have only ever really worn PA except for challenges, couldn't care less for outfits ... I only use excavator due to the weight bonuses and I like how PA looks, but you spot on with the appeal for other outfits, that makes sense.
---
Weren‚Äôt those kinda broken? By broken I mean they never lined up with floors correctly because they were supposed to connect with scaffolding right? It‚Äôs been a long time but I remember they had some issue with connecting properly

O ic yea im pc

Oh I'm already set on using the [gladiator helmet](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gladiator_mask) for my Knight outfit at the moment, it's the body part of the outfit I'm not sure what I'm working on

I do like the steel mill helmet tho
---
I am more worried that the forest starting area is going to actually be an ammo dump for high-level players. it is nice to be able just casually walk through the forest on shotting stuff with a weapon. I don't want to encounter level 68 charged ghouls when I am just trying to capture the Tyler County Dirt Track for a quick challenge.
---
I am fine with lower levels scaling up their damage to fight higher monsters, but ONLY IN EVENTS! This way the Mire and Bog are still overwhelming to new players and they are not trying to power level a character by running to the high-level areas to kill more XP giving enemies
---
Power armor isn't that bad.  I do agree it could use a small boost, but it does have a number of advantages over non-power armor.  
---
* Power armor effectively has two "Acrobat's" effect, reducing fall damage to 0
---
* Each piece gives you 7% Damage reduction, to a maximum of 42%.  Effectively the same as about 3 pieces of Slayer's gear but that works against all enemies
---
* Power Armor has a hidden Radiation Resistance Stat, making it pretty much the only way to go into a nuke zone and still have a decent DR/ER
---
* Speaking of DR/ER, most level 50 PA has the higher DR/ER in the game compared to non-PA (Fully modified Secret Service is 327/297), to go beyond that you need to use Perks to get additional DR/ER. Sure Iron Clad can give you +50 DR/ER but requires 5 END SPECIAL to be slotted for it.  Barbarian gives quite a bit too, but unyielding not withstanding, most players probably aren't going to be getting more than +40 to +60 from it (which is still very good) but if you are that invested in STR, it may make it harder to slot for other abilities (again, ignoring Bloodied/Unyielding for the moment)
---
* Power Armor is customization with the equivalent of legendary effects: Internal Database gives a +2 intelligence, which could have been two minor slots on armor and you get to choose to take it if you want.  Emergency protocols further reduces damage and increases speed.  Medic Pump is basically "Auto-Stim"
---
* Many of the power armors are cheaper to repair, in that you don't need ballistic fiber to repair them. This is really more of an issue for lower level, newer, less prepared characters (or players who are just bad)
---
So I think, when you look at the benefits that PA offers, it does seem to compare to non-power armor in \*most\* situations.  Where I personally feel PA starts to break down is in two areas:
---
* Carry Weight:  Between backpacks and the reduced weight legendary effects, power armor really struggles here.  Throwing on a set of power armor and having your weight go from "I can carry an extra 100 lbs" to "I'm 250lbs overweight" really hurts it.  You can play around it, but it makes it hard for people to want to just jump into a set of power armor. 
---
* Unyielding: This is probably the bigger elephant in the room.  when you have a set of gear and a playstyle that gets you the max +80 DR/ER from Barbarian, gives you a ton of dodging with seredipty, maxes out all of your specials (minus END). But unyielding is very powerful, it overshadows pretty much all the other non-power armor builds too. Any playstyle - stealth sniper, melee/unarmed, commando - can be made a powerhouse with an unyielding/bloodied build.  
---
So this is my take, I might have missed some points or thoughts, but I don't think PA deserves the bad rap it's getting.  I think there are two key issues, one can be solved in game, the other one I'm not so sure about (not sure they want to start nerfing Unyielding).
---
I keep having these nightmares. Floating in space forever. Just... why?
---
Except during dupe waves, you had to actually farm/put in game time for the 5.56
---
It all depends on your build really, but it mainly sits with heavy weapons and melee weapons bc of their insane DPS potential. Ones that mainly do the most damage are bloodied builds but can die usually in 1 hit from the queen. Some people will argue that explosive weapon's are best but a while ago there was a nerf for explosive damage on her, so you want the most DPS potential, something with faster fire rate and a prefix that buffs damage in some way. My personal queen killer is The final word, a anti armor faster fire rate ultracite 50 cal. AA works because of the queens insane defenses, so that's viable as well.
---
As long as the buttons don't glitch again... my buttons used to be floating in the air and I'd have a blank control panel and have to keep replacing the elevators
---
I actually found her at the little tower when you first leave Vault 76 (to the Southeast) but she's a random spawn as you wander in locations.  I know there's a link out somewhere that shows all the places she commonly spawns.
---
I'm not planning to complete her mission going forward. I completed it with three toons, which was two too many. If we had a mute button/control, however, then I would, but I just cannot stand listening to her.
---
but it's purely cosmetic, non functional, but a must have. Counts as a vendor, water resources and a power generator; neither vends nor produces anything.

/s
---
The update 22 in September is the one wasteland update Which is basically a lvl sync system across the whole game. The whole map will be balance to your character lvls
---
I‚Äôm people are scared about the update and some are excited about it
---
I spend more time doing the one daily NW Challenge than I doing all of the other daily challenges and missions. Especially the survive 30 minutes challenge, fuck that one
---
Been offered an AAE Gatling Plasma but was unsure if it is any good
---
I wouldn't say that, there are some weapons that are just really high DPS weapons, and don't use bugs.
---
I second this opinion. Hopefully this post gets to bethesda.
---
elevator, aka Player Launcher 9000
---
No help from support? Can't imagine...
---
Yep, just last night. About 6 fusion cores worth of fat laser into the SBQ annnnnnnd blue screen.
---
I recommend it. But im a solo player. In my private world i can still use the group functionality for xp bonuses without havign to worry about some rando joining my group.
---
The infinite crafting stash is nice too. Those are the only two features that matter to me.
---
You do get some atoms credited to your account every month, but i havent used any of mine. You also get free skins every now and then.
---
I never have a problem with steel... on the occasions I do run out it usually takes five minutes tops to stock back up on what I need.
---
Thanks Todd.
---
Most of the perks are still bland imo. System still sucks too, ofc.
---
You will be already
---
The hackers are bad but splitscreeners are very annoying. I really like NW and I hope they will fix the hacking problem.
---
Agree, the coin system is stupid beyond belief.  Especially that you have to scrap cards to get them, which means you realistically can't change your build if you scrap everything that you aren't really currently using, beyond the perk cards for repairs/crafting etc.
---
Touch√©. I try to grind as best I can amd save up to the stuff I _really_ want and accept the fact that I am not gonna be able to afford it all. Sad but true
---
How much did you played? 10 minutes?
---
Instigating is just as good for high damage weapons like shottys etc, you one shot everything not a SBQ or Legendary sheepy
---
Thanks buddy!
---
Yeah they are good weapons.  What did they want in trade for it
---
It would be insane on any ads and ground fodder, and with it's high rpm it dishes out a lot of DPS, even better with AA. Only negative is really explosive big we are talking ONLY the queen here, due to her minor explosive resist what you'd loof for is ffr or any DPS buffs, but it's still one hell of a good gun. Plus it's a fucking legacy, I'd give my liver for one.
---
That's pretty cool, I was expecting like the football helmet, going along the Legions armour style, but that's actually really good for a knight get up. 
---
There's also the Robot Helmets? Sentry, Assaultron and Eyebot, I think the variants are. 
---
You can unlock them by scrapping Military-Grade Circuit Boards.
---
That should do it, and is considered Legacy as these never spawn anymore. Most likely duped though, market will be flooded with God roll and legacy weapons shortly.
---
don't mind it that much, it forces you to mix things up a bit. I'd find it more boring if I never had any reason to switch from my lmg with exploding bullets and guaranteed criticals.
---
lol same, I'm terrible at PVP and don't like it so never bothered.  But by forcing me to login for the S.C.O.R.E. I've found I've enjoyed it and will play it occasionally now.
---
Hiding makes it more like a horror game, so when I need to survive for 30 minutes that's my go to.  But it is also a LOT of fun ambushing folks who pass by your bush unaware of you.
---
Yeah we like to get all of the new camp stuff on our accounts.  I don't really care for a lot of the outfits and stuff but camp items we gotta have em.  Esepcially the plushies and stuff xD
---
This is wrong, it was stated it's coming to Game Pass for PC also.
---
As to why it's not there ATM I have no idea, ask the Major or the Bethesda fo76 Twitter accounts.
---
Not OP, but I have no screensaver, still suffer this same issue. If the computer sits long enough to idle on the main menu it crashes or locks up the system requiring a computer restart
---
I'll make them work if it kills me, just put em in dammit
---
What new weapons we can‚Äôt trade?!  I thought everything was tradable in this game. Where did you get that weapon
---
They said they didn't want people to have to choose between 5 coins and scrapping a silly little animated card that people might be keeping for a "collection". They give the same stats as regular cards and you have no way of showing of your card collection. I say put it back to 5 coins, they're just digital cards that are animated, nothing special. Now when I get one in a pack it's a let down knowing it will only count as one coin.
---
Have you tried dismissing her, loading up another ally and playing with them a couple quests, then switching back to her? That fixed my glitch with her, which sounds like the same one you have.
---
there are weapons known as "magic weapons" with broken effects. they literally melt the queen, no perks needed.
---
Right, they use magic
---
As someone who just leveled a new room and had to use guns which broke very quickly I can confirm that this card vastly slowed down the repair times
---
Also not actually out on the PC for some reason :/
---
Pros, having seen a similar system implemented in ESO (imo):  
---
-Friends who are different stages of the game can play with you without feeling useless.  
---
-EXP is rewarding regardless of where you choose to explore/go.  .
---
-Rewards are scaled.    
---
-Events become more challenging as they don't have to be scaled to the area.    
---
-Everyone can participate in an event in some way.   
---
-No content is 'below' a character.   
---
    
---
Cons outlined by others:    
---
-Pre-level 50 exploration could be impacted. *(Although I feel if you follow the quests you will generally follow the correct path so IDK if this is as big as an issue for new players)*   
---
-Because you know about the system you don't feel as rewarded for levelling. *(See: Skyrim/Oblivion before you realised/read it was a scaled levelling system)*  
---
-Flattened power curve  
---
Overall I personally feel the positives outweigh the negative on the surface. But many of these issues could be addressed through a good implementation.
---
if that was 308 ammo for the LMG, then no. that is maybe a minute worth of bullets for that gun
---
Yeah, I'm not surprised if the last long though. I know a certain melee build is one as well as a gauss shotgun bug.
---
dakka? like dakkakkakakakaka?
---
This isn't healthy and we shouldn't be celebrating or encouraging such an insane crunch. 
---
People have literally died doing things exactly like this. Idgaf if people think I'm overreacting.
---
Now y‚Äôall know how I felt going vendor-hopping and hearing the god-awful Fasnacht Scavenger Bot everywhere.
---
they had to 1up the fasnacht music
---
Current game mechanics: enemies are different levels depending on where you travel on the map (scorched around Flatwoods vs scorched near Fissure Prime).
---
One Wasteland: every enemy you encounter is based on your current level, no matter your location.
---
Yes we need more dakka!!!
---
Oh there's a few out there in the thousands who abused the xp glitch. Hell there's still people using the god mode glitch and using it to advance down the legendary run. I just watched a YouTube video that apparently someone already is at rank 100. Bethesda needs to watch the YouTube videos that are stupid enough to put their names in them and just start banning them. When we report a player, we're asked to provide video evidence. Well, YouTube is chock full of evidence.
---
I've got the same thing going on and unfortunately I haven't been able to find a decent steel plate looking outfit other than heavy metal armor. The Mechanist's Outfit from a limited time Quakecon bundle is close, but it looks sooo ugly with the NW Gladiator Mask, plus it was only available in a paid bundle for a limited-time event so I doubt it's even an option for you.
---
Maybe the best option is the Union Soldier Uniform? It's not armor, but it's antique at least and looks good for a wandering knight-errant type.
---
So if I travel with a low level friend he will have no chance of surviving is that it?
---
My Responder character camp is open with the exception to his living space cabin and scrap collector. Crops, water are free. The workshop cabin I leave the door open and his medical cabin is also open. I just like it if people would close the shower room after! üòÇ
---
Why? Just fits the character. If somebody was in need, he would help.
---
Not quite that bad but my buddy and I did a breach and clear event for the ore but every container on the motherlode was already empty, kept joking that we'd ignore the last container and it would have all 30 containers contents inside
---
Make it play the Fasnacht song.
---
I mean... congrats I guess?
---
It tends to hurt when I‚Äôve used all but a tiny bit of ammo, finally take down the hard to get 3* legendary and then get kicked out before embringu√© able to loot. All the time effort and ammo for literally nothing.
---
Sir, why hasn't Bethesda offered you full-time employment? I'd upvote this post a million times if I could, but you'll have to settle for one...
---
have to have a heavy machine gun type weapon (minigun, gatling laser) and it has to meet the following criteria:
---
- a fire rate of ~200
---
and
---
- prefix of instigating, junkies, medics, stalkers, OR secondary effect of +33% VATS hit chance, +50% limb damage, + bashing damage. you only need any one of the above.
---
magic shotguns exist too, but to my knowledge they don't melt the queen like the absolute beasts that are the heavy machine guns. 
---
as others have mentioned, be mindful that this is a bug and is likely to be fixed in the future.
---
Legendary perk points, passive perks would be far easier and allow  legendary perks to actually get polished.
---
My red asylum dress
---
They mention they adding perk card deck to allow multi build per character but this perk coin system seem to counter the scrap card system
---
I have said it multiple times they should also allow players to get PC base on exp (10k exp = 1 PC) too so we don‚Äôt have to sacrifice all of our cards
---
It has nothing to do with OP doing something unhealthy. There is no doubt. However it proves that all theories about players not being able to finish the grind was absolutely exaggerated and not true
---
I guess I see how it makes sense at some points but what will low level players do if level 300 players are around? Will it just spawn level 68 ghouls and such in the beginner area? What are the reasoning for the update?
---
You can build your base in the diner down the street from the shooting range in grafton.
---
That‚Äôs a good point. I‚Äôve been looking forward to the new Perk Loadout overhaul coming in Winter and I‚Äôd never thought of how this will effect it. What‚Äôs the point in having a Perk Loadout system if you have no Perk Cards left to use.
---
Yup I got those already, I wish the eyebot one was smaller, seems huge haha even bigger than a normal eyebot
---
And the assaultron one I wish you could keep closed if you wanted to, I like the animation but it's hard not to look really silly with the helmet open
---
The sentry helmet I have no complaints about 
---
And yeah there are some really cool cosmetics in NW, I've been playing it nonstop to try and get that helmet and I'm only maybe two or 3 games away from rank 50
---
It's been my goal for like 3 months now haha
---
There are some other cool helmets too like [centurion helmet ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Centurion_helmet_(Nuclear_Winter\)) and [makeshift ronin helmet ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Makeshift_ronin_helmet)
---
I also got my fav power armor skin ever which is the[ pink donut power armor skin complete with sprinkles](https://imgur.com/a/EIHZNY0)
---
I feel the same, but i cry instead
---
Suddenly when have a KFU - a kilo-flamingo unit
---
Sounds like someone‚Äôs got a case of BIP (Bethesda Induced Psychosis). 
---
Not much is known about this relatively new syndrome, but some patients have been reported to mumble ‚ÄòTodd, no, Todd‚Äô in their sleep
---
The participation trophy era you speak of isn't the fault of the kids, it's the parents wanting it for them. Blame Boomers and Gen X for it, not the Millennials or Zoomers.
---
All i seem to get from Technical Data is 2mm EC and purified water. I've not gotten plans for easily 6-8 months and haven't gotten any of the BoS paints at all.
---
And they will probably take that into account. Perks and gear all improve as you progress. 
---
And so will the monsters. If they do it right, the mobs will always be of the same relative strength. Super Mutant in the forest, needs 10 shots to kill for example if your'e level 10. At level 50 fighting a super mute in the Great Divide, 10 shots. Char level 100  fighting a SM in Cranberry bog? You guessed it, 10 shots. Feel powerful yet? You've gained all them levels for what? 
---
Now, this is assuming they even do it right. Scale to high, and the game might become to challenging for casual players. To low, and its the same as it is now.
---
But wait, factor in a good build and lucky item drops, then you'll disrupt their scaling completely. If they manage to successfully factor in Perks, Mutations, Gear and all their interactions, then your build gear wont matter either... 
---
Might as well run into a fight naked with a lvl 1 switch blade and no perks and all SPECIALS at 1. You'll be just as good as the guy with a 3\* BTSE Fixer and synergistic build. Now your gear and build mean as little as your level. Game dies. Bye bye.
---
Yeah I really hope mechanist comes back, I didn't even have internet for the month it was available :(((
---
I killed a 3\* lvl62...glowing feral ghoul (I think) just the other day to get myself a 1\* assassins pool cue. Another 3\* lvl 62 later (snallygaster I think) to get myself a nocturnal wood leg piece.
---
Truly one of the great days of the game for me.
---
Yes... and 1776 is not early 1700s...
---
I personally don't mind stretching my NW legs every now and then. I find it mildly enjoyable.  
---
A challenge that is worded like: "NW: Get a kill OR Adventure: kill 50 super mutants" would be my ideal solution due to still allowing people who like NW to get some credit against SCORE playing NW.
---
yeah shotguns are bugged in a similar way. you just need the right legendary effect, and the main difference is that you have to use VATS to get the stupid damage output
---
The system overall should remove mobs lvls so the ghouls will be = to the low lvl and the lvl300 player
---
Wtf is even a food build lol
---
How do you PvP if a down vote hurts your feelings?
---
Alrighty, I thought it would've been up so I've been wanting to jump in as soon as possible haha. I'll keep an eye out on their accounts!
---
And here I am just reached lvl 20 yesterday.  But then again I‚Äôm not playing to grind score.  Im playing to enjoy my playtime.  Getting score points is just a bonus for me.  
---
Congrats I guess but no game is worth that grind. NO GAME.
---
Have you considered  one of the exploding statues?
---
I've tested with and without it and for the most part it seems to not be working currently.
---
Like OP pretty much said, it's tragic that people on this sub have had some great ideas for improvement, but when considering the big picture (just fixing this damn game), their ideas probably wouldn't even crack the top one-thousand on Bethesda's TO-DO List. The recent post about "not emptying your vendors when you move your CAMP" comes to mind as an example.
---
the wheels on the bus go \*SCORCHBEAST SCREAM ATTACK\*
---
Seems like a work around to lockpicks and hacking being passive perks. If this requires you to have those perks equiped as well then dear god what a waste.
---
I have. Did a few raider punk weapons, back to her, same. support bot just trots out usual common sense drivel (hard reset, log out and back in etc)
---
But ok.  I have to just accept it. Found a wandering settler and made her my new camp buddy instead. Also she is good for a weapon case retrieval every second day. So that's a win ...kinda
---
Literally happened in nuclear winter to me yesterday
---
Oh I see now!
---
I‚Äôm not an expert clearly on this topic but doesn‚Äôt the level of mobs define how much health and damage they have and do?
---
So it would hit the level 300 way more damage than the low level? Am I understanding this correctly?
---
They just want the 15% exp bonus fron inspiration, which ya know building would be better than events for that. 
---
But heaven forbid you point that out or you might get downvoted to oblivion or upvoted. This sub is a fickle thing.
---
Romney West Virginia was originally settled in 1725
---
The cultists are Lucky hole are in for one hell of a Groundhog Day.
---
Enjoy that ebay gun.
---
As you say a building team would be better with that and the int increase
---
Well done, sir! An upvote is the least you deserve for this effort... I'd love to see you in-game rocking that level 100 PA skin too!
---
Lmao, true high end players like me trade our way up there, ebay is for sissies.
---
I've crippled all the enemies before, immediately run to get more and I get like 5 ore and the NPCs are all drying because someone killed all the ghouls. I got on the mic and explained to them to only kill a few at a time so they can farm exp but also keep the NPCs safe, it worked out just fine. 
---
I get people want exp but you can just kill part of the crippled ghouls and keep it at a manageable level.  We can't just let every event boil down to the method which gets the most exp because some people do want the completion rewards.
---
 "perk coins" sounds like we are playing, some FTP mobile candycrap?
---
I usually play 2-3 hours a day and missed all of last weekend due to being out of town but am only at 13 now.  Not really a team guy so that‚Äôs likely holding me back but there‚Äôs no way in hell I will come close to hitting 100.  Congrats to those that do, but honestly I have a decent job and family obligations and can‚Äôt check out for 20 straight hours in a row.
---
Same here.  I put everything up for almost nothing and it still takes forever to move.  30 caps for chems?  I can't even give that stuff away.
---
Well with all the ‚Äúin-app‚Äù purchases we may have to put forward to advance in the game, we might aswell be.
---
Where's the imported chinese panda?
---
Might be cool if they got the eyes right
---
You can turn it down by adjusting the effects sound slider in settings.
---
They need to move all PVP to NW and purge Adventure Mode of all PVP. Adventure Mode should be pure PVE.
---
That's getting pretty close to a long time ago...
---
Well you can grab one of those pretty easily.
---
Everybody fire in the hole!
---
Whatever , it‚Äôs at the top of the map 1776-2076 so I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs when the in game land was colonised , again ... my point is the style of costume , 1700 - 1776 had similar clothing , just want that style of clothing for males and females . Pirate outfits are similar style ... just want some period dress for ladies aswell ... not sure why my idea is out of the question ... I think they would be outfits similar to civil war outfits ... just isn‚Äôt many clothes in atom shop for women it always seems to be men‚Äôs clothing and  very similar !
---
If you are on PC there is a mod for that.
---
I typically have 80-120k of 556 on me along with 20K of ultracite 556 due to being a handmade and combat rifle junkie.
---
Or opening your pipboy and closing it works.
---
O I never said they made it any better they just removed good ones for non PA.  And you cant tell me PA guys weren't crying up a storm I can go back and repost at least 100 post of PA biulds complaining about how the non pa perks were so much better then what they got
---
That's still true lol
---
Keep the dress! It's one of the rarest items in the game. Plus there's a weapon dupe going on right now.
---
It will make me quit fo76 like I quit eso when they did it.  I cannot say enough how much I hope they don't ruin 76 by implementing it.  I agree that it basically removes any real sense of progress, and lowbs can already group with high level folks and contribute.  I just don't see the issue they're trying to fix with that üòê
---
I fire once with a grenade launcher which is enough to tag most of the enemies. I even take off demolition expert 5 so it doesn't do too much damage.
---
This is one of the best events to get XP and mats.  Assuming people show up and do their part!!
---
Master Infiltrator looks like a must pick.
---
What good reason does it have?
---
I mean we can jump and shit and the system tries to force us to use the stairs, this is just stupid.
---
If you look at a lvl300 Technically.. it isn‚Äôt any stronger then a lvl50 character because at it base a lvl50 vs lvl300 are the same. 
---
You unlock more perk cards as you are high lvls but you can only equip the same amount as lvl50 
---
Gear also caps at lvl50 so there isn‚Äôt a gear advantage.
---
If they follow the formula from elder scrolls online, 
---
It would work like this. the whole map has lvl50 mobs low lvl player will have a buffer that make them equal to lvl50 players 
---
The closer the players get to lvl50 the weaker that buff yet so it balance it out
---
It made ESO infinitely better in my opinion but really doesn't seem appealing or necessary for 76.
---
So good news and bad news when I went back in:   the unyielding chest was BACK in my stash, but the Western Outfit wasn't.   I'm beginning to think the guy really didn't buy the former, the the UI lagged/slipped or something.   I did just successfully sell about 1500 shotgun shells, so it's working (mostly?).
---
Just do flamingos. They take up the least budget and easy to scrap
---
It was a little wiggy.  I got around it by building off the elevator instead of adding it later if memory serves.
---
From what I understand they are planning to introduce the same system as ESO uses. Monsters will scale to your level regardless of who is fighting it.
---
So if you are level 5 and you are with a level 50 character and you both attack a ghoul, you will both contribute equally to the fight, it will be equally challenging to both of you. IE. if you are level 5 the ghoul is a level 5 ghoul, but for the level 50 beside you the ghoul is equivalent to level 50.
---
The idea is that a low level character can contribute just as much to a fight as anyone since the enemy and his damage scale the same as a high level character.
---
The draw back of this is that you lose that feeling for high level characters of being essentially invulnerable to pretty much all low level enemies...now you'll be scaled to face the same challenge as a low level character except with more perks behind you.
---
Hope that explains it...it seems an awkward idea to try and explain. 
---
In some ways it's good since it allows low level characters to team up with higher level ones, in other ways...not so good as now high level characters don't get that same feeling of becoming powerful as the enemies always scale up to be tougher.
---
No need to grind to lvl 100 anymore üòÇ
---
Have one, but that requires people to activate it too.  I also have the Babe the big blue ox, the kiddie ride that plays music, the satalite dish
---
(I exclusively spend my atoms on CAMP items, don't care about skins)
---
hey. you guys shoot what you want. you kill as many or all the bad guys you want. dont hold back and risk losing an event just so sally can get a hit on a monster and then take the gun and trade it for the script. if you want to farm legendaries do it by your self not at a group event. forcing others to hold back so you can farm is BS. and you risk losing an event.
---
Nope. We need some game fixes! Fix your game bethesda.
---
Please. Majority of all legacies guns in this game are all duped ebay guns.
---
Exactly this. I usually just pick up a launcher from one of the bodies and then collect ammo on every respawn. one well placed shot for me  only does spalsh and at most 150 or so damage to any one mob, which is not enough to kill anything. 
---
However if more than one person is doing it or spaming actual powerful grenades it becomes an arms race. But I mean come on.... It's a glitched event. Complaining about XP farm on something that actually shouldn't even exist is a bit rich really, considering you'd get a lot less if it was played properly.
---
Without a doubt there are plenty of really good non bugged weapons in the game that are good enough to solo the queen anyways.  Seems like most people talking about queen killer weapons lately are talking about bugged ones lately in my experience at least.  
---
My favorite non bugged queen weapon is my bloodied 50 cal, bit it doesn't make a the pretty light show op is looking for.
---
I haven't tried the ox but the kiddie rides are great
---
Most of the time it‚Äôs telling you this because it‚Äôs true - and you can‚Äôt have floating second floors or roofs and upper walls attached to thin air. I‚Äôm not saying it always works perfectly, but there‚Äôs a good reason for having it unless we want to add more physics-defying constructs to the mix.
---
I think you might be onto something with this.   See my OP edit for info.     
---
Thanks so much for your feedback, you and everybody.   It's always appreciated.
---
normal one doesn't, legendary like Junkie and Bloodied are, along with 2 times firing
---
apparently

As really big warning to op and others reading this; very bad idea to base your build off of a bug unless you already have the materials to do so, so that you aren't left in the dust when a patch hits.
---
They forgo the fun factor and try turning this into a game where the whole point is to get you to login as often as possible to throw the atom shop screen at you.
---
Definitely agree with the poster who fears the lunch boxes being added to the shop. Ptw in it's full glory.
---
It sucks the perks are still mostly shit too. We've been waiting 18 months for this......at least make them wacky, fun, and useful.
---
yes I got a bloodied ATL and a TS fatman, let the firework begin
---
Yeah but theres really no end game? And Ive stopped getting stronger like 40 levels ago so i feel like the progression youre talking about doesnt exist in the game right now
---
Game mode request: 76ers mode / Ranger mode
---
No hud 
---
No UI
---
No quick selection
---
No pipboy during combat
---
No ft expect camp, tent, and stations
---
Well there is a gladiator costume in the game. We have a couple civil war museums where you can find old clothing.
---
So this idea isn‚Äôt out of place.
---
I doubt the other pets would share the same pathing but that is pretty damn interesting. I'm really looking forward to whenever those pet emotes (that briefly showed in the AS a while back) get properly added to the game, hopefully with some kind of pet rework. I'm thinking that's coming with the One Wasteland update so our pets will scale to our level, or something like that so they aren't absolutely useless anymore. Well, I say that but really it's just the critters and sloths, the Deathclaw/yao guai/mirelurk king are able to hold their own surprisingly well... In the forest.
---
You're braver than I am to keep a cat. I would be devastated if anything happened to it! As it is I fast travel back to camp nearly every time I see someone shopping. Enemies seem to respawn when they load in and people will totally ignore them, hurting slothy boi as they browse. I've found I really need a turret or two but the missile ones actually hurt my pet too.
---
Oh yeah I didn‚Äôt know why I used a level 300 as an example. Maybe just for the contrast itself. Totally forgot for a second that 50 is kinda max. 
---
But okay I think I get this! Thanks for your help!
---
Imo this seems a little weird. There‚Äôs something cool about being in an area where you know you shouldn‚Äôt attract too much attention. 
---
If it‚Äôll just be the same all around It sounds like the game will get even easier. 
---
But yeah I haven‚Äôt played eso so haven‚Äôt seen something like that in action from what I recall.
---
Bethesda knew they couldn‚Äôt stop adding new dupes and that‚Äôs why they added the non tradable items .
---
Idk how people are still upset or surprised by their incompetence
---
It's not as bad as I feared.   The unyielding chest piece was put in my stash.   I think maybe lag/slippage was an issue in this situation.  (?)  Thanks for your feedback and thoughts!
---
This was a nerf and regular cards should give more perk coins, im not talking about the reasoning here.
---
Maybe it would have been a better idea to have a "match level" option for teams?
---
That way if you had a low level friend you wanted to play with you could "match level" with them and it would just apply a percentage penalty to you to match their level? Or low level could "match level" to a higher player and get a boost.
---
Something along those lines would still allow different level players to team up without causing issues for all the rest.
---
How about the inability to respon after death once you've killed the imposter sheepsquash.... good times
---
The thing is, there are bugs allowing people to build true air ships anyway....
---
Sorry, there was some lag here too apparently, as in it didn't show when I went to check post.
---
Thanks for your support -)) I'm just a concerned player who really likes fallout games, but it seems like the last couple years things go south a bit too much for me not to start speaking up about game's future.
---
I'd prefer if they made score equally attainable through adventure and nw. I'll be honest, I'm bored as shit on adventure rn and it'd be nice to just play some nw while still making progress on the board.
---
Why? You can just dupe the 5.56?
---
Yes I KNOW.   It didn't show when I first checked.  Is there some way to remove a post?
---
I‚Äôm aware! I‚Äôm not a fan but as someone who likes to build practical things, the message helps me NOT create impractical things.
---
Paying for atoms to advance down the legendary run is mobile game territory. If you spend money on atoms, buy a rank that gives you scip, use that scrip and roll a B/25/25 Fixer, is that pay-to-win? Maybe.
---
I would like to see that as well, I mean most dailies aren‚Äôt too bad for now but some rough. I don‚Äôt mind doing nw daily but only if it‚Äôs easy or not too much work like placing your camp or just staying in a match till the end.
---
In my experience, public teams aren't too bad. I have had no one actually talk in them and not everyone sticks together. Give it a try for the bonus,.
---
That's why I said, "except during dupe waves" before I said people farmed it lol
---
You can never have too much. That .50 is a hungry weapon.
---
The abundance has little effect to the in game price of legacies.
---
And elite players can trade for whatever we like without the help of real cash anyway.
---
If it spawns normally, I can run out and punch many mobs before people shoot them. If it's glitched, use a minigun to tag or something and stop complaining about the extra xp. 
---
Unless maybe you need people to line them up for you it something.
---
I agree 100%.  I was modifying my camp the other day and needed to remove a staircase.  I had to tear apart half my camp to make it so I could remove the stairs.
---
No I totally get it now. Thank for your thorough answer! 
---
Yeah I also see both pros and cons about this as I read it. 
---
But I guess we‚Äôll have to see how it feels. 
---
Any idea of why it‚Äôs planned to be implemented? Has new players complained about difficulty or what is the reason? Don‚Äôt think I personally see the problem as it is now really
---
That is disappointing, I liked how different the Elder skin seemed compared to the others.
---
You lucky radiated basterd !  
---
2 cattos ftw !
---
The point of these is to boost play styles because Bloodied is clear and afar the best for damage, and sustain. 
---
Right now berserkers is usable but it‚Äôs alittle harsh. But not as much as people think I can walk around with 0DR and be fine farming with lone wanderer, blocker, ricochet (which isn‚Äôt useless it negates ranged dam, the defection part just isn‚Äôt good for dps but it‚Äôs a GREAT perk to mitigate dam) So the flat 10% and other 10% ranges would amount around to 75% melee and 45% ranged with all the perks for damage mitigation active. Add that with life giver and a vampire weapon on stand by 
---
I can agree with the power armor comments.
---
I disagree with high maintenance comment, yes it‚Äôs a flat buff that‚Äôs the point. Bloodied at 20% health increases damage by around 70% while simultaneously uny armor is buffing all stats by 3 (so u never run out of ap your melees are op with no damage perks invested) serendipity is doing ever more damage reduction, nerd rage, adrenal reaction is also buffing things further.. a buff to other play styles is needed or they need to nerf bloodied. But as it is it‚Äôs just not balanced (and I have a bloodied and a junkies toon) 
---
Also for the specialist one it‚Äôs literally just to keep it in line with other weapons. junkies is +50%, bloodied is +around 70% berserkers is +50%, anti armor equates to around a flat 30% uptick in damage.. and that‚Äôs to ALL enemies. If they are going to have Enemy specific weapons the least they could do is be on par with other general weapons but just without drawbacks. 
---
In any event thanks for the feed back! It‚Äôs very interesting.
---
What about that mechanic but implemented some other way - there was a mod in skyrim that made looting a spell you could cast. Maybe a "looting gun"?
---
Those Cursed weapons are going to pair well with Luck of the Draw. Low durability but they could auto-repair themselves with that card. I noticed there's not much difference between rank 1 and rank 3 of that card either. I use rank 1 and my guns are always fixing themselves.
---
they wont last long trust me, ive had that much and its gone in no time
---
Yes.  You get 2 of them and then you can just jump off anything and never worry =)
---
Well you're a big boy. Draw a picture about it and mommy will put it on the fridge.
---
Bethesda AMIRITE!?!
---
Some shitty YouTuber is already posted a vid. Is going to be fucked up soon
---
Whoever came up with the 'perk coin' system deserves to be hugged by a mirelurk king. Why not use a similar system to how it currently is, just with specific slots and different perks? Why again this gating behind a 'currency' which has no reason to exist in the first place? Just shows they're not actually trying to 'reward gameplay' they want to deter from it, no 'long joyfull play sessions' in the evening, only daily login to buy the random Atomicshop item and then log off until 24hrs later is their target routine.
---
This is getting silly.  First everyone is supposed to just tag a legendary and wait until everyone had their turn with it before killing it, now everyone is supposed to hold back for XP grinding?  People are jerks for completing the event objective (protecting the ASAM)?  
---
I'm an unarmed build, I'd never get mad at people killing the spawns there.  I'll just help complete the event, earn the event XP and rewards, and then go server hop Fort Defiance or West Tek to farm XP much faster and with overall better drops than trying to milk an event.
---
Won't need to repair the dress all the damn time either.  Non explosive gattling plasmas already break pretty quick.
---
You can build practical things without this shitty feature, just be smart.
---
The thing about this feature is that it's fucking stupid, it doesn't really know when it should pop up.
---
pretty new to the game, is duping an issue in the game? i suspect it's rampant from this post
---
That has no affect on when the server saves.
---
It's the Dark Matter combat rifle paint and T-65 Onslaught paint that I'm after. Still a ways off from that (I'm SCORE 30 as of last night) - while I'm hoping to make it all the way to 100, if I get those 2 in the bag, anything afterwards is gravy.
---
I was doing the same and it wouldn‚Äôt let me remove walls that were just floating there. I got so mad I had to replace my camp to get them to go away and redo all of it.
---
I really feel like I must be missing something - a top-level legendary perk takes 1000 level-ups to upgrade?
---
I see u never join Line in the Sand event since the Legendary Run began, it's never legendary farming event dude
---
&gt; And they will probably take that into account. Perks and gear all improve as you progress. 
---
Perks and gear will not be considered for determining mobs strength, only the player's level. However it's likely that your weapons will do less damage, if they are below your level, to encourage you to collect new gear, similar to ESO (probably capped at level 50)
---
&gt; At level 50 fighting a super mute in the Great Divide, 10 shots. Char level 100 fighting a SM in Cranberry bog? You guessed it, 10 shots.
---
it's already like that because of the level 50 soft cap.
---
&gt;But wait, factor in a good build and lucky item drops, then you'll disrupt their scaling completely.
---
you mean like bloodied makes everything super easy, right?
---
No matter how you balance the enemies, an overpowered build will make the game child's play. Which is why builds have to be balanced too, but most people in the community are against balancing their overpowered toys...
---
&gt;Might as well run into a fight naked with a lvl 1 switch blade and no perks and all SPECIALS at 1. You'll be just as good as the guy with a 3* BTSE Fixer and synergistic build. Now your gear and build mean as little as your level.
---
press x to doubt. Watch what ESO did. Some that is going to happen.
---
This mod is amazing.
---
Damn. I hope you're okay.
---
I'm on PC, so...
---
For me personally I like them but I agree that they need to be very easy ones so that everyone can accomplish them. The placing your camp or killing 3 creatures type of challenges are easily done in one or maybe two matches. I think that instead of surviving 30 minutes maybe it should be more like 5 or 10 minutes.
---
It's up on the store but not the Game Pass app. At least here in Germany it is.
---
Many times ...
---
You're not missing that much SCORE. It'll add up after a while, but I've been totally ignoring the Nuclear Winter challenges that I don't like. I skipped both the revive players and pick three locks challenge. Too situational, and I don't mind a game or two of NW but I don't want to spend all night on it. The place your camp one or level up rank are short and sweet and I hope we see more of those, or more like it. Super easy to get even if you just bush wookie it.
---
I havent goteen it yet, but am excited for the UFO playground. The stars wallpaper i have all over and really love it. Finally moved my camp underground and really shows it off as a juxtaposition.
---
Lmao true high end players like me draw pictures on your ass with our legacies instead.
---
Yep. only stack two though and you‚Äôre maxed
---
Hmmmm, Fractured Steel...
---
Maybe  Rahmani did go rogue, and the Appalachia group will be an ideological split from the main group? One that doesn't that's a little more into helping society. The way I always hoped the BoS would be.
---
No you didn‚Äôt because people have millions of it sitting on a mule . It‚Äôs not caps so there is no limit on how much you can sitting on a mule
---
Her dialogue is pretty stale and unnecesary.
---
Beckett on the other hand cracks me up.  "I had a dream about the mothman last night...at least I think it was a dream."
---
It gets a chuckle from me every time.  If it was real life and any of your roommates said that to you every day you'd be driving them to therapy.
---
My gf sits with me while I game and heard this for like the 5th time and says to me "Is he okay? can you do anything to help him?"
---
I'm like, "No, Beckett just made a lot of bad life choices.  This is who he is now."
---
I doubt that much will change for high level players, however the game will become more accessible for beginners and new characters.
---
Oh that would be perfect.
---
Again ... it‚Äôs the 18th century so clothing from that period is what I‚Äôd like to see

I love throwing myself off Seneca rock

It's up now: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/fallout-76-pc/9nkgnmnk3k3z](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/fallout-76-pc/9nkgnmnk3k3z)
---
Bethesda would never scale the coin payout in that way. If anything, it'd be the reverse like 3 per level for 0-100, then 2 from 101-250 and then 1 per level thereafter, or something similar to that. 
---
Bethesda LOVES to front load all the bonuses so it looks like you're progressing a lot but in reality you have a massive grind ahead. They did that with Atom challenge rewards. They did that for rep and bullion grind and they've also done that with the score system. 
---
At rank one, you could go up a whole rank just by completing a single weekly. By the final ranks, you're needing several weekly challenges just to go up 1 rank.
---
But why?
---
The system was built with being able to complete it without having to do NW. specifically for why you said. You don‚Äôt like PvP. Same here. Will never do NW. but I‚Äôm not worried about not getting to the end.
---
Im lvl 120
---
That's not how it reloads, though. Have you used it? It loads exactly like a Colt Single Action Army in .44-40 Win (a Black Powder Cartridge in it's day, now there are smokeless loads available.) For all intents and purposes it can be lumped in with the others.
---
Doubt it, they usually wait for the weekend
---
35, all but one NW daily (revive three players) and a minimum of 15 repeatables a day. 50 repeatables on July 5th.
---
if it was played properly, the sneak commando and heavy gunner builds guys can still get plenty of exp. Aoe spam made most people got few or nothing
---
I thought we were in Appalachia?
---
I think its patched already(hopefully and tks god). Im verifying with friends and not working.
---
:(
---
Awesome work
---
Also, make it retroactive so those of us who are already high levels don't have to grind even more.
---
I don't have any friends to make this particular dupe glitch work, but if anyone ends up with surplus Safari Crocolossus backpack plans, I would like one please. :-)
---
There is one in settings, it's hud opacity
---
Awesome, thanks! Installing now
---
When 5.56 first became the playerbase accepted economy there wasn't a dupe wave at the time, man. You had to farm it or trade for it. People who didn't have anything worth trading farmed it by running Lucky Hole Mine
---
For sure!
---
I really hate NW, I always do the hiding thing and for the most part get up to the last few characters (being a sneaky bastard helps). I just play it to complete the odd objective now.
---
The one time I ended up working with my team I was in full marine armour with an auto laser rifle, I was with all my team mates laying low while the storm approached. One character in light armour with a rifle jumped in killed each of my team mates while we were all shooting him then killed me in two shots...then jumped off. At that point he had 13 of the 18 kills. HOW??? I play on Xbox so I assume he can't be a hack...so how is it that four of us laying in to him does nothing and he casually kills us all and myself in just two shots in marine armour. This just sours me so much on the game that I just stick to the hide and survive mode and only play if I absolutely must.
---
PC NW seems to be in a much worse place than console NW. That being said having it as a way to grab some extra score is fine. Also, I was able to do the lockpicking by just a quick search for where the locked containers spawn on the map, not luck unless you count getting there first.
---
No probs.
---
Yeah it is not easy. I struggled hard with blueprinting it. To be honest, i don't have it blueprinted at all because it never worked out for me at some point. All i have as a blueprint is just the tower itself without any benches or decoration. Every time i replace it, i just put my module down somewhere else and use the temporary blueprint the system created i find in the "stored" tab.
---
To the OP, how much score do the tiles cost when you‚Äôre within like 10 tiles of board completion?
---
I see u never use minigun in this glitched event, u can try before an AOE spammer, see if ur pity toy finish spinning before all mobs get devasted
---
When you say checked the settings, did you check in FO76 under audio to make sure the chat volume was turned up? I noticed everytime I go into a party chat, FO76 automatically moves the chat volume in game down to 0.
---
Are you stupid? Don't encourage their microtransactions bs. You're part of the reason games suck these days
---
That building is part of the Galleria though. The internal cell includes  that. It just doesn't have any entrances or exits.
---
Just an fyi incase people didnt know. Players glitch the spawn intentionally.
---
Thanks for posting this, let‚Äôs see how it gets adjusted this time. Thanks for all you guys do in the PTS üôè
---
This would be fixed if kills and revives we're viable ways to get experience instead of just staying alive.
---
The red rocket protectrons got him before he could finish his sent
---
Are you sure I swear I saw T-65 marked along with all the others.
---
Maybe I overlooked it
---
Dude, there is a lag before they all drop. I got sick of not getting any hits so I used a normal minigun and timed it. But honestly, you just want to complain so I'll let you do that in peace.
---
Right.  I'm curious to know what type of lifestyle allows someone to do this to themselves.
---
Well yeah that's totally fine. I'm sure the community is great
---
Yeah now I get 30 of 2mms instead of 15 of them, this is almost as op as Woodchucker, ALMOST.
---
You have issues, dude.
---
Line in the Sand objective is not protecting ASAM, try harder   
---
And no, glitched Line in the Sand farm XP faster than West Tek, u get at least 2000 XP per wave, it's simple math
---
It‚Äôs the ‚Äòjust can‚Äôt shake these nightmares‚Äô line which is played on a 10:1 ratio vs anything else she says.
---
The event is more important then individual xp.  If you want xp, go farm. 
---
If there is legendary I will only tag it and hopefully everyone else does the same, I hate the one shot.
---
Have you played fallout pvp? Unbalanced and broken. That‚Äôs why id prefer a team death match and just me it would be fallout. Enclave vs BoS raiders vs responders the list could go on
---
26 I think.
---
Doing all dailies except NW. Almost done with weeklies. I do a lot of events with a buddy and try to keep Int up for xp. I have bursts where I try to grind out score but mostly just doing what I always do. Kill, build, shop, kill.
---
How is ESO now?
---
I played some of the public BETA's and when the game came out, didn't keep me interested for long sadly.
---
A little late to the party here, so I'm not sure if this is a hot take or if it's already been mentioned: my prediction is they will add Perk Card packs to the atomic shop as a Utility item with the release of this system. The Perk Coin grind appears to be a core part of the system in all its iterations so far, despite community feedback. This way you'll have the "option" of buying Perk Coins by buying card packs.  I fully expect Legendary Perks to be another way for them to monetize the game, not as a reward for loyal gameplay.
---
This feature is already in the game.
---
Yeah, I don't want to trade in all of my extra cards. I like to have the flexibility to try different perks out and different levels of different perks if I change up my build. If I have to turn in all of my extra cards, this ability is removed. In order to get enough points to actually get a legendary perk, I would have to get rid of a bunch of cards. I don't have a problem getting rid some cards since there are some that I would never need but if they do some balance changes some of the perks I'm not using could become viable.
---
Yes i did and the chat is at 100 i cant talk at all it just does not take my mic for some reason
---
Exactly, balance is whack, Bethesda have no clue wtf they are doing with NW.
---
They can even give the module like mods, so not at every scrap, still would be perfect, am I the only one who is making the thinking for Bethesda?
---
No life.
---
That guy probably never offers anyone a glass of water when they come to his house... But really though, its a matter of parenting tbh.
---
 I run into the opposite on video games more often than not. It's misbehaving children on video games. If your going to let kids game in an online environment, especially rated M games. I'm not saying it's wrong, it's just supervision. Life is full of jerks, and they are going to hear things that they might not be able to comprehend or you want them to hear yet. On the other hand you will have 10 year olds who have freedom to play games and call you names that you'd hear before a bar fight. OP did everything right imo, but I think it was learning experience. You can't control what others are going to say or how they say it. That's why the mute button was made.
---
I get where you're coming from but I actually love when people launch their big guns.  I'm melee so I go running out there like a nutjob to bop everything.  It's hilarious fun to run through fat man nukes and explosions all around me.
---
Plus, I've seen a group fail that event.  I was totally surprised because it is such a long event, we had lvl 300+ there and still lost because we weren't paying attention. I don't ever want to have that happen again.  So I say let fire rain from the sky.
---
And? If it was played properly would you then complain about that instead? you're essentially complaining about the way an exploit is  exploited. Who gives a shit what you can do with it played properly? Noone cared before and it was just a case of get it over with to get the end XP and rewards, the mobs were just a pain in the arse delaying the event. 
---
You're only complaining now  because everyone is on the XP train and wants to get as much as possible. If you took a step back and realized how ludicrous it is you're actually fucking whinging about a glitch being farmed too quick when you are trying to do the self same thing is just insane my dude. 
---
XP is grindable and noone gives a shit at any event or place anymore. It's all about that legendary run farm. It's not like legendaries being one shot, XP is repeatable everywhere there's always more. Join them, or go to a private world, place your own tent in the shitty spot and grind it solo if you want to explot it fully. 
---
I personally leave my tent there all the time now on every server, so even if I don't attend people can farm it if they go there without having to know about the glitch and the exact spot to place it. I couldn't give a shit and you shouldn't either my friend. At least not enough to make a post about it.
---
Or you can find 2 pieces of armor with 50% reduced fall damage and save yourself the card slots for something else.
---
They aren't hard
---
Dumb questions  
---
\- have you tested your headphones / mic ? if they are working ?   
---
\- once I managed to switch off my mic via button I did not even know, but it was there :D
---
\- check windows settings of your mic, I m switching headphones / wireless headphones and speakers, sometimes it just stop working.
---
Wait what is this about? Has there been a new update today to the perk system?
---
Lol no , 5.56 has always been an in demand ammo that was accepted as a secondary currency and dupes have been around as long as the game has
---
I dreamed of the Mothman the other night.. *sniff*  I think it was a dream anyway..  - Beckett
---
Playing 81 hours  straigh grinding seems pretty time gated to me...
---
I know in Fallout 4 there was hidden objects that caused certain idle animations. Like in Covenant there was a jump on counter object on top of the workbench and the counter in the store. There was a lie on ground object on some of the porches for the cat. There was a lean against wall object around some of the buildings that the npcs would use. I suspect it is the same in Fallout 76. The world has those hidden objects and so your tamed cat will use them. I suspect if you were able to place your camp near one of the settlements like Foundation you would see your Ally fixing mailboxes and such.
---
Why do they call them dupe waves?
---
Yeah I just don't know how generic the coding for these NPC camp objects are. 
---
On one hand  it might be a specific pathing just for the Cat NPC and only works for them. On the other hand it might just be simple pathing with only that one non-hostile NPC spawned in the area so its a non-issue gameplay-wise. Hard tellin not knowin lol
---
I'm not expecting much of course, but with the age of the engine and the way things are heaped together there's a chance worth exploring imho.
---
One other note about my Tamed Cat, he doesn't seem to be aggressive towards hostile npcs nor do they seem to be hostile to him. Had a few scorched show up just now and two of them just ran past my cat within inches. Murgle seemed unphased as well lol
---
I think the non-aggression thing is just tied to those few pets that stay at level 1. When I tamed Mr. Kitty in the first place it was at the northeast corner of the map by the fissure site. I tried the world hopping thing after taming to try and get em to spawn at my camp directly but no luck. But somehow that cat made it from the fissure site to a little ways north of Hillfolk Hotdogs all by himself!
---
At first I like "Holy smokes Mr. Kitty how did you make it all that way completely unscathed? You're a BEAST! ... Actually, now that i think about it you're in really good shape... Like every animal around here is somehow affected by the radiation in some way but you.. you're completely fine. Totally normal cat." 
---
It was that moment I realized my cat is a damn synth. Still love em just the same though :P
---
When's this come to live servers? And do they need unlocked or everyone gets them?
---
No, the objective for line in the sand is to protect the sonic generator in the center and keep the ASAM working to kill the Scorchbeast while waves of Sorched attack.  It's a bigger version of the Surface to Air.  That's the objective.  
---
You glitching it with things like 1st tents so they spawn differently doesn't change what the actual event's objective is, and I have no sympathy for people glitching the event to maximize XP.  
---
And 2000 per wave is nothing, that's approximately 6 charred ghouls inside of Fort Defiance, I can get 2k XP just running the first floor area of Fort Defiance, and without the hassle of worrying about what anyone else is doing.
---
I'll start, here's a downvote :D
---
It's obviously satire what I wrote. I'm sick of people whining about how much they hate nw and how they're "forced" to play it.
---
Yay üòÜ
---
Animated cards we giving 5 points per rank now they give 1, they nerfed this endless grind system even more, they want us to get to level 3000 or something, i aint got time for that.
---
Ah ok, I thought you weren't sure why they did it. I just read why it was changed and thought I'd let ya know. Carry on.
---
This idea almost seems to put too much incentive on alts and does not reward those who have spent their time on one character equally.   
---
Alts are far easier to level up and do not show an equal distribution of time spent in the game playing.   
---
I am assuming that is what we are trying to reward here, time played.
---
hopefully your sacrifice will mean they'll ease up the future grind because the more people feeling like they need to do this the more questionable bethesda's actions are regarding players health.
---
The vaults had several glaring faults - firstly at higher levels they could be failed, not due to enemy difficulty but simply the coordination and time required. Secondly they were a huge ammo sink for ranged builds.
---
Thirdly you didnt actually get any XP. So you chewed through all this ammo/stims etc for no XP.
---
Lastly the final reward wasnt really worth it either.
---
So you had an event that used tons of resources, gave no XP, and even if you didnt fail it the rewards weren't worth it anyway
---
They already know the challenges auto complete if:
---
- You are online during the rollover
---
- You play NW first after the rollover
---
- You played NW last before the rollover and play Adventure after the rollover.
---
This occurs on all platforms, and has since NW launched a full year ago.
---
And is scraping perk cards now a thing or has that always been a thing that I just didn‚Äôt know how to do
---
I don't know then, does chat work on other games?  Maybe check that to see if it's a FO76 issue vs. maybe something with the headset itself?
---
Its not 'obviously satire'
---
Got a link to any of these things that've been datamined?
---
Not necessarily; just disable VATS against players (like in NW) and change tesla rifles to where you have to hit an actual target (player or NPC) to get any arc/splash damage (meaning just spam shooting the ground won't do anything). After implenting those 2 changes stealthboys aren't really that much of a problem since there are ways to counter (berry mentats) and hostile players get a little red triangle over them once they engage.
---
I've found myself wondering why I still play this game but I tend to come back.
---
Back to the OPs question :  
---
( I would like to know too ) :)
---
Does the perk ( goat legs ) and one piece of falling damage reduction work same as two pieces of falling damage armor ?
---
I am merely commenting on your first sentence that Appalachia was settled in 1776. Never said anything about the 18th century:..
---
Weird af that you grinded already. you need a hobby, a job or something mate.
---
I know this has probably been asked before but at what levels do you get to pick a new legendary perk? And you can scrap unwanted normal perks to level up legendary perks right?
---
Yeah, it sucks for sure. At least now with public teams, you have the chance to reload back into the same server to still get the rewards if it didn't fail.
---
Modern and clean.  Looks great!
---
Your music selection is on point as well.
---
Should we have sympathy for people who are exploiting?
---
No sadly.
---
Try harder to defend and argue, I can tell u Ripper perform better than minigun in this glitched event
---
This is probably exactly it lol
---
NO MORE CURRENCIES.
---
This is supposed to be a game, not a banking simulation.
---
I mean, at it's core, is spending real money on pixels that you don't actually own stupid?  Probably.  But it is disposable income so if we don't spend it on that it'd probably be spent on something just as stupid.
---
Look, I enjoy playing the game and other games and like to buy stuff to supplement that enjoyment.  For every person like you whos boycotting the atom shop out of principle there are 10 other casual players who never go on online message boards opening their wallets.  It is what it is.
---
Goes up by 25 each level, from 99 to 1000 is 3475.
---
It could be because of the lore, looking up ultracite power armor it says that the full suit was likely never put together by the BoS. The Lost Hills chapter developed the schematics and sent it to the appalachian chapter but it had a flaw that was fixed but couldn't be sent back before they were wiped out by scorchbeasts. So maybe some paints will come for it when the BoS comes back since they might actually be able to make one when they do
---
All about the quad ammo crossbow
---
Other games work fine
---
"of all energy weapons" there, i fixed ya!
---
Never said your idea was bad. Just pointing out 1776 isn‚Äôt right. It says 1776 at the top because that is when the USA declared its independence. 2076 is the tricentennial.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox you can use your recent player list or try and find a new friend to help you on lfg
---
You're straight up lying because I have a One X with an external and my game crashes at least once a day.
---
I disagree with all the comments about PA being underpowered, and if you read on, you'll see why I think that PA balancing, the current PTS legendary perk grind, and the current live meta are all tied together:
---
In terms of raw mitigation, it's very tough to beat power armor, whether you play with emergency protocols or a full health "born survivor" auto-stim build. Power armor's base 40% mitigation is currently unattainable by any other type of armor.
---
It's also solid endgame mitigation available for very little work to new players. They can collect a set by server hopping, be tanky and farm nuke zones right at level 50, allowing players to build up their resources and get the hang of endgame crafting. From a game design perspective this is important because levels 50-150 are the most critical: they're when casual players drop off and lifers like us get hooked.
---
Power armor starts to look weak when you compare it  to stat gains versus the unyielding prefix (specifically exp from int) and the lack of bonuses PA offers to weapon damage. It only offers DPS boosts to heavy guns, and there should be more perks like stabilized (in int or elsewhere) to make other builds feasible.
---
Really hot take? Unyielding needs a nerf, and I say this as someone who uses bloodied builds on 3 chars. It is impossible to balance the game against stealth characters who triple the exp gain of everyone else, in addition to every other stat benefit they get. I believe that PA, and so many legendary armor prefixes, are weak only when compared with unyielding, because it's just so MONSTROUSLY strong.
---
And I think we all know it, because we can kill anything in the game within seconds, including SBQ (unarmed meat-stacking video from AngryTurtle), from stealth.
---
Bethesda will struggle to balance the game versus all of us running unyielding, bloodied builds. The power creep and exp scaling requirements will be immense. Worse, designing the endgame around ludicrous level 1000 characters and perk coins starts to make sense, when you realize that all of us lunatics are stacking exp buffs from int, herbivore, cranberry relish, etc. They are designing a (bad) meta around the gameplay we are using, because it's hyper optimal and because Bethesda isn't addressing it.
---
So in summary PA is weak, compared to the current meta, which is so OP in so many ways that it's no wonder Bethesda is designing systems for people who are level 1000.
---
Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
---
Literally.
---
It is a preferred legendary perk for 9 out of 10 Rocketeers.
---
Last I checked West Virginia is in Appalachia...
---
I originally started out as a regular armour user, but I switched over to power armour when I dropped rifles for heavy weapons and I've been using it since. I actually just crafted the last part of my T-65 last night, but I need to keep  it stashed for another few days until I get the shocks for it. I'd had a break for a month or so otherwise it'd have been fully finished by now.
---
I would agree that PA in general could use a bit of a buff. Perhaps something like adding a set bonus to each suit, maybe with an extra bonus if it's matched, a better/wider selection of mods (especially for the arms, something like Precision Servos that gives better accuracy for example) or maybe just adding a second mod slot into each piece as well since I doubt we're ever going to get legendary parts at this point.
---
I'm at a loss then, I'm sorry. 
---
I know I have an issue where chat on my game is quite, but it still works.  You may want to try opening a ticket? Maybe they have some troubleshooting tips that can help.
---
Legendary perk
---
Imagine calling yourself a "high end player" because you traded for a duped gun. A true skilled player probably would be someone trying to do as much as possible in the most skillful and unique ways, instead of just following the crowd and using big strong dupe gun.
---
&gt;  it helped distract me
---
You addicted to heroin or something to need that much distraction? This is weird af that you grinded all of it already lol.
---
Yeah my whole group has been playing tons of NW lately so I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre at least giving us a reward for that mode too
---
I didn't know pets were coming.  That's exciting!
---
Probably thanks anyways for trying
---
Not likely, they haven't before.
---
As soon as it was announced my interest in the game started dropping.
---
Thanks anyways for trying
---
Turning off grass helped, too.
---
I'm turning into Nancy Reagan: just say no to grass, kids.
---
Brotherhood of Squeal
---
We don‚Äôt , there is always a dupe in this game so it‚Äôs just a dupe ocean
---
I know *sighs* let me dream.
---
I'm in a similar situation, always at or near max and sell most items for cheap more to spread to lower levels. The only reason I price rarer items higher is to prevent scalping.
---
I buy serum plans when near max, now that those are done I've been buying recall circuit boards.
---
If this was a CAMP item, they could make it so that if you use it at someone else's CAMP, they could get a percentage of the donation, maybe like 10-20%. It could be a way to both get a bonus for yourself, while giving back to someone else. Would be a nice way to give a small gift to nice camps or good players. And if you choose to use it at your own CAMP, you don't get anything back, so it could an incentive for players to visit other's CAMP if they are in a generous mood when they want their bonus.
---
oh, you are right, I didn't think about that and just realized that there is a dip in the Galleria so that you can go to the other side. WOW, after 650 hours in the game, I just realized that. DAMN, that would have been a prime spot for the Atomic shop IMO
---
No, you would see a lv 42 scorched, your friend would see a lv 5 for example.
---
I'm definately seeing similar, for me the 2.5x always works outside of Vats (Not counting the constant health rubber banding). 
---
But as soon as I use sneak attacks in Vats, a fair amount of the time I won't be able to 1 hit enemies I know I could 1 hit outside of Vats.
---
Sounds like the challenge system in fallout shelter!
---
I quite like this idea, it's good for if you're nowhere near levelling up aswell.
---
Upvoted.
---
LOL this gave me a good chuckle xD nice satire OP.
---
It‚Äôs still working
---
Ok , I thought it was a founding date my bad
---
is that a troll post or are u serious ?
---
Public teams don't have some of the downsides of private teams....they can't access locked items in your camp.
---
I think you have more assburgers than me then if you couldn't see the satire in my comment.
---
2 h per day ... pretty to say... which can rapidly transform into 6 hours per day if I dont play on a weekend, or go on vacation.... this method is ridiculous...I have to carry my console around not to fking miss a challenge... somedays I can play 10 hours... other days I only play 10 minutes! Other I cant play at all.... why am I being punished for having a life? I should be able to earn  much more score by playing regular activites, not being tied to DAILY challenges...
---
i wonder if the PC version allows xbox cross play?
---
if so i may end up wanting to switch over but not switching over because fuck microsoft their last update broke my windows 10 so now i cant update properly and the games on the microstore have a mandatory windows version requirement before you can play them despite not actually needing it... i cannot even play minecraft with my nephew anymore :/
---
Oh no I need my comrade chubs
---
Sweet, sweet unemployment with a dash of fat savings and this life can be yours too.
---
oh, sweet child of summer, once I was same like you. Than I realized how poorly is end-game scripted.  
---
If you have FO 1st, just mule them to another / unused one. Back in my FO76 prime times I was rolling 5 daily scrip limit.  
---
1. Store them ( do not bother to store 1\* weapons and armor, only if you have a lot of free space limit
---
2. I donated the good ones - I have nothing to buy with caps, so I am not selling.
---
3. Just let them go, it seems they wont adress this ... excellent prolonging of non existent end-game :D
---
It's become so commonplace that it's pathetic what can you do
---
Remember, some of the items that convert to acid don't get scrapped with "scrap all junk."  Check your stash for bloatfly glands and such.  You might already be sitting on some acid.
---
I really think you're being overly paranoid.  Some people just AFK at others CAMPS or just chill there.  It's normal behavior.  
---
Do you normally get nervous about people at your camp.  If So?  Why?  I like having people to see my camp so I can show off my build.
---
It‚Äôs ok. I assume you aren‚Äôt American?
---
Could have been some type of visual or lag glitch. I have seen some AMAZING things happen in NW before!
---
I think you fucked up the delivery and wanna try to save face by falsely claiming the people not 'getting' it have a disease they dont actually have.
---
Nice, but what do you mean when you say mule them to another / unused?
---
Just released:

If I need to play NW I head for the nearest sensible bush. I then read a book (yes a paper thing) while casually glancing where the firestorm is heading. If I need to move bush then i will slowly and avoiding firefights noise to the next available bush, and next chapter of my book.

Nope! I'm tired of either my game, or rarely even the server it's self, crashing when they try glitch the spawn into a clump.
---
I don't give a damn what their reasoning for doing it is. They're rolling the dice on everyone there, with this fragile engine and twitchy servers, every time they try it.
---
NW gets one daily and one weekly (and even that was just this week, probably won't even be every week), everything else can be done in Adventure mode (and on top of that Adventure mode xp earned in NW doesn't count for the repeatable 10k exp weekly challenge). You say you respect those who like it, then why ask for their removal? The "it's forcing me to play NW" argument is nonsensical. No one is forcing you to do anything. If you don't want to play NW, don't play it.
---
What's a split screener?
---
Nope. Can‚Äôt happen
---
British
---
Naw I'm fine with it. Try harder to whine. If a topper works then use it. I just told you what I used and it helped, sorry
---
So far for the most part all I've seen us people teaming up for the buffs. Outside of events it's no different to normal.
---
I usually default to it because a lot of the people in public teams I come across aren't using it or often any card at all.
---
I normally swap out to travel agent then.
---
Can you scrap the legendary perk and get coins back?
---
Yeah thanks. A couple of users explained it as well. I get it now. Thanks
---
Honestly, the people I have teamed with mostly either aren't sharing anything, share Radicool, or they or I change shared perks to prevent doubles. Sometimes we both change it to the same thing too, and then we both change it back, then there's that awkward pause and one of us changes again haha üòÇ
---
But please... *PLEASE*.. the only people that use/benefit from Radicool are people that already have it equipped. Pleeeeeeease share something else!
---
\*squee\*
---
Bubblegum and Quantum! Must have.
---
Well you should definitely know that date then! King George wasn‚Äôt too happy when US declared independence lol. You all were there way before 1776.
---
I think I keep missing where this is in the build menu. I‚Äôve looked several times. Where is it?  I may have to create a ticket.
---
There are folks that don't check when they join/others join to make certain they're not putting up a duplicate/are swapping out anything that is being shared so their own loadout is optimal for what they're doing?
---
Link:
---
It might have been but he was literally 100 feet away with only his head poking out of a rock and I had seen him with no gear before which makes me think it wasn't any lag.
---
Yeah NW is promising if they can fix hackers and exploits for sure.
---
They are people with multiple accounts on the same computer and they control them at same time. Some use more screens that's why they are split screeners. They are annoying because if you kill one player they will come after you and kill you since they know your location.
---
Lmao true high end players like me are not like the majority that can only afford normal Bloodied guns. 
---
Lmao true high end players like me trade for high end stuff like legacies that are waaay less abundant than bloodied weapons even people duped the shit out of them.
---
True low end players will never admit how shitty they are, like poor people won't admit the same thing.
---
I am not shitting on poor people but I only respect people who respects a true high end player like me.
---
Aaaand a true high end player like me can fish a lot of comments just to shit on people, not that's a true high end player.
---
I think the flare gun scares away certain creatures like in nv lonesome road.
---
Ditto, loudest camps in the Appalachians haha ü§òüèº
---
Its similar in concept but psnow isn't even in the same conversation as gamepass. I have both and while psnow is good if you only have a ps4 its definitely closer to stadia in terms of quality.
---
This happened to me yesterday. I waited and waited until about 10 seconds left to initiate the event and said fuck it, I'll just use this to farm xp.
---
Once there was only 1 scavenger left alive, a bunch of people joined lol
---
Same, one youtuber talks about it, and now it's all the rage of this amazing XP farm. 
---
I mean if you're going to exploit, there's another place to do it endlessly that doesn't put the server at risk and doesn't rely on the event triggering.
---
I don't play it enough to give you a thorough opinion. It's pretty casual until you do Group Dungeons.
---
I spent 5 hours trying to kill a legendary, but other people wouldn't just stand back and let me! This has to stop, Bethesda!
---

This is the third time the economy gets ducked.
---
It's fun when you play with a team and get kills and stuff. I'm in the bear squad so games are very enjoyable.
---
Was he wearing power armor by chance? Had a guy on my team yesterday that looked like he was standing still like a statue all game despite running around killing people with a Gatling gun.
---
Thanks. That's a potential outcome for sure.
---
I am solidly in the "Rain Hell from above" type, but I do feel bad if I see a melee running around, struggling for tags.
---
 "considering everyone would get a lot less if it was played properly"  
---
 "Who gives a shit what you can do with it played properly?"  
---
Y u mad dude, it's u who jumped in and start this, oh because the event is glitched so we can ruined other 10 players' experience? 
---
 I see why some people mad when PvP initiation was limited again and again, oh it's a wasteland game we can do whatever we want but u cannot hunt me and take my loots even if I acted like jerk because my pacifist mode is on
---
Best comment haha
---
Nah just purely naked, only had his vault suit on lol
---
Create a character that you have no intention in playing with strictly in the purpose to hold your extra items. If i remember correctly you can hold 1467 lbs on your character and 800 in your stash.
---
likely do to steam sale for game being 20, generally a rise in cheaters in games when they go on sale
---
I agree, it's not fair on people who are doing a sneak/pacifist play through.
---
Ummm....why?
---
LOL, well next time record that nonsense for us all to see!
---
I thought fallout was making its own dates up ? Are we talking about real life now or the game ... because a lot in the game is made up
---
Nice man! Yeah my gf and I play it sometimes and since I got alot of experience in FPS games we do pretty well. Sometimes the rando fills we get are also pretty good and that makes for fun games.
---
Just go do the Leader of the Pack event in the Forest area.  The alpha wolf counts as legendary when you kill it and it only takes a couple/few shots even with low level/low power weapons.  Challenge complete.
---
Something like this 100%.  I'd rather card scrapping be a supplemental way of getting coins vs. the MAIN way of getting coins.  Have events grant a healthy chunk of coins (like Project Paradise, Encryptid, Radiation Rumble) if you do well.  Make that future state "excursions" grant good coin rewards.  Add challenges that give coin rewards.  Adding a pure XP grind that would make a Korean MMO blush is a horrible idea.  Holy crap Bethesda, you literally have DECADES of MMO history to look back on.  Guess what MMOs did well in the West?  The ones that weren't tedious soul destroying grinds.
---
You're deranged. Go away now you bore me.
---
Huh, that might explain some of the things I've seen in NW. Thanks :)
---
It still baffles me that we can't manually change the ranks of cards up to the maximum we unlock, because I actually have some dupes of low rank cards, but I feel the involuntary need to hold onto cards of various ranks in case I need the perk point for something else.
---
We already have the artillery piece in the game, could be a skin
---
I mean, I am just taking the piss out of people who complain about NW dailies.
---
You gotta admit that killing legendaries sucks, though.
---
They do work and im on ps4 i cant check windows  settibgs man
---
Getting kicked from the team may also caused by network problems. My friend has (of lately) shitty connection and he kept kicking people, me included, form the team every time he had a short break in his connection while he was the team leader (short as in skype call didn't disconnect).
---
Also other people just standing there may be game lag, we had lower level staring us by the work shop over 5 minutes while in reality they had already fast traveled / changed servers a while ago.
---
Just means more server crashes and disconnects
---
My question is always ‚Äúthis is happening in a modern day game still?‚Äù That‚Äôs always my reaction to it. I get it, games have bugs but I can‚Äôt think of ONE modern day game with as many still standing bugs as this one. It‚Äôs lucky I like it so much ;-)
---
If people are allowed to complain that they are forced into doing NW for their full S.C.O.R.E., I should be allowed to complain that I am forced into killing legendaries.
---
My satire-detector must be broken.
---
Sorry.
---
Variety is definitely the best approach! I like sharing L3 Inspired since I know most folks don't have a bunch if points in Charisma, and once Adrenaline is working again I'll probably move the SPECIAL points back over.
---
In which case Aquaboy, Travel Agent, or Good Doggy it is!
---
I believe the daily events achievement is referring to other daily achievements that refresh every day. I.e. kill 10 scorched, claim a workbench, build 10 camp items in a camp or workshop.
---
Unfortunately, given the defensive diminishing return caps out around 400-450, that's... not going to do anything for someone in any model beyond a T-45 or Excavator.
---
It means the other daily challenges. I assume your missing challenge is the NW one.
---
this event failed only when no people can afford 4 steel per machine broken, with 1 minute repair time
---
Ah yea, cool, thx man, this game is growing so i will expect much more good stuff especially for end-game, I didn't thought it would grow like this, I am impressed by Bethesda now actually
---
Third time in 2020, what about 2019?
---
You missed like 3/4 of what I said
---
The daily achievements
---
I died more times in FO4 falling through the floor of a moving elevator than i ever did from enemies.
---
Did they update some of the perk dcards and make them better or they stoll trash
---
Its bitching like this that makes me want to get off of this sub reddit
---
I second this
---
It's supposed to according to their announcement but it's not up on their game pass app. I wonder if they forgot to release it on PC
---
Yes. I swan dive off of mountains and bridges with no worries.
---
The third involving weapons and armor
---
Ahhh, ok. Thanks.
---
Yeah, I don't want to uninstall the perk loadout manager mod to be able to do the NW challenges.
---
Yeeting myself off things is the only time I play in 3rd person.
---
Ur blank minigun works better than gauss minigun and minigun with E prefix, magic just works
---
Yes, unfortunately. Every month a new dupe method comes out and people dupe god roll legendaries and rare outfits by the thousands. It really does negatively impact the game in my opinion. God rolls aren‚Äôt even special anymore because they‚Äôre duped so much. Rare outfits no longer as rare anymore etc. Bethesda will fix it and then someone just figures out a new dupe method pretty quickly
---
Scoped lever action with tank killer and rifle damage perk, plus popping psycho, makes that thing an absolute beast.  Headshot will down a full HP marine armor player, 2 body shots will down you if you didn't pop a med-x ahead of time.  
---
Also the auto laser rifle is horrible when shooting it automatic mode.  First shot is accurate, then it scatters around like broken sprinkler.  Even in ADS.  Laser rifle you're better off treating as a semi-auto/single fire weapon from range if you want it to be effective.  Ironically, the auto laser pistol is far more accurate at mid-range in automatic mode when ADSing.
---
I don‚Äôt know where the schism happens in the game. But there is a lot of real history as well. Go around fallout 4 in Boston and find all the plaques and statues about the revolution all around.
---
I don't care either way honestly. Ethically I wouldn't do it, because stuff in any game is not worth that much to me and I enjoy the journey ane the excitement of a good drop after 456 noctural shovels and 345 mutant lead pipes. 
---
However what IS an issue is people endlessly posting about it make more people aware of it in places like this, which accomplishes nothing but perpetuating it and bringing us once more to Beth having a reaction and removing a lot of content once again to deal with it. Report it to the appropriate channels and leave it. Some dude linked to a video of exactly how to do it earlier and said it wsa a PSA. That's not a PSA, that's just stupidity. 
---
I personally like my vending. I like selling stuff for others and finding good stuff to trade. Sure Beth with react again at some point but maybe the measures wouldn't have to be as extreme if the idea and method for it wasn't spread everywhere for people who wouldn't ordinarly know nor care to be tempted by it, They may wait and fix it in a patch if it's minial and contained, rather than it being widespread because people can't wait to tell everyone about it here. 
---
Shrug.
---
My only issue with dupers is if it leads to Bethesda disabling something that I use regularly in the game. That's a negative impact to the entire community.
---
No problemo!  Good luck out there.
---
Try Jailbreak Event - tons of Muties and you can easily take it on solo from the rooftop of the church.
---
Um... it‚Äôs complete 5 daily challenges. Not daily events.
---
Legit me, every time:
---
"YEAH, GREAT GAME BETHESDA!"
---
"Great game Betheada... &lt;3"
---
actually . i am an alpha player and legendary monsters do spawn at that event. as a matter of fact last night when i did ours we had a nice 3 star legendary scorched beast fly by and killed it. and in between that and the waves of monsters i was one shotting. i could see plenty of lower level people plinking and body checking. i am required to do events to gain score and treasury notes. we go to these events to WIN. if you want to xp farm, legendary farm, scrap farm, item farm. that is not our problem. do that on your time alone.

The best legendary I've snagged so far is an exploding executioner's LMG and I have come close to selling the motherfucker so many times because it eats up so much of my loadout weight and when I finally pull it out, it's like SSSSQQUUUIIIIRRRTT and there goes my 350 rounds of carefully-hoarded .308.
---
I always picture Bethesda's servers running on coal like an old train. Just one guy shoveling coall all day into the engine.
---
Heres my suggestion make legendary perks stronger versions of current perks for example a strong back legendary will allow you to fast travel while overencumbered...  At a increased cost of caps
---
Grandmaster damage bonuses to certain weapons doubling their current damage *aka a god send for sniper builds like me who have to duel build shotgun and sniper to be any use in schorchbeast queen
---
Or something for the little jack of all trades inside all of us thst gives a 25 percent damage boost to all weapons
---
2000 per wave? Looks like ur Int point is too low in the game lone wanderer
---
Most of the BR regulars that were playing this are playing COD:Warzone now.  Playing NW half the time feels like kicking a bunch of kids now lol.
---
On the plus side, it feels like a lot of the hackers also moved to Warzone (plus for NW, not Warzone)
---
Don't repair the frigging middle launcher.
---
Inert Flux has a weight of 0.20  
---
Purified Water has a weight of 0.5
---
Yeah, as soon as I finished her questline, I gave her the boot. I can't even stand going to other Camps and hearing her there.
---
Gramps is fine but his Ally Quest is broken, or I'd keep him permanently. (It sucks, too, because I could get a decent weapon out of his quest each time. I had better odds than Murrmrgh.)
---
A missions that starts with "Daily: ____"
---
Check which ones you have left. Pretty sure you don't have to do the NW one in order to get 5.  All of my challenges were completed this morning except the NW one, including the complete 5/5.
---
I bought a vampires 3* explosive Gatling gun out someone's vendor the other day for 1000 caps. Excited to use it.
---
Don't buy repair kits, pick up junk and weapons/armor from enemies and scrap them for components to repair the stuff you use.  This way you'll get XP and learn additional mods to use down the road should you choose to.
---
" AND they need to work"
---
Woah woah woah now you're asking for too much!
---
Which was stupid.  "Sir, the animated cards give more" "Hmm, let's rebalance all the cards then" "So all cards give 5?" "LOL, you're silly, now they're all worth 1!"
---
What‚Äôs going on?
---
You probably should at this point.
---
Apparently they removed the legendary perks that add extra DT for having a full set of light medium and heavy armor... those were literally the only perks I was looking forward to because of my full unyielding urban scout armor. Now I‚Äôve just lost all interest in legendary perks.
---
If you are going to AFK at someones CAMP, at least go into sneak. That way you're not showing on the map at their CAMP.
---
NW auto-scraps duplicate cards anyways, giving you Overseer tickets and a small amount of Overseer XP.
---
Yes i agree but this is satire!  Enjoy it!
---
At level 60 you should be able to do any event or mission,  if you want to post your build I am sure we‚Äôll have you soloing the SBQ in no time ( I‚Äôve seen it done at level 45)
---
Maybe go play the sims? That might be more your style....
---
I saw a couple of those at a camp. They're actually really cute. :)
---
There should be just a new mode for a more hardcore Adventure mode experience (not similar to Survival mode) that opens up when you're level 50.  Everything is max level there regardless of zone, and a bunch of other differences that set it apart.
---
Until the SBQ starts going down in 30s every single time with hardly anyone even getting to the fight. 
---
Granted it's more than just the god roll weapon that causes this, but it's a major part that will now be easier to obtain.
---
I‚Äôm not pressed about it, but would love to hear more. PM me please.
---
Right.  I addressed that in my post.  
---
"The extra DR/ER/RR of this perk hardly matters with diminishing returns anyways, so the main benefit is to disease, fire and, most importantly, poison. "
---
In T-65 it may mean we take 1 point of damage more often than 2 points from most attacks lol. :)  Tho who knows, with the addition of the rebalancing of One Wasteland, how resists scale may change anyways, including the diminishing returns cap.
---
I feel like your under lvl 60. Get your own gun and do the same or dont play
---
Not for a while. I think my last CTD was about 2 weeks ago when I accidentally ran an outdated mod.
---
In 76, I've always been curious why they removed the ability to "grab" objects and corpses and move them around.
---
New weapon and armor dupe
---
No, I wont, I lost 6000 EXP by not doing dailys... Will take more then 10 hours to complete the challenge 60 times
---
With duping still prevalent, no one should be surprised!! The most recent dupe just went public.
---
My main thought, is if they're going to introduce this HUGE well of grind, they should probably look into giving us a way to constantly farm XP on the same server. 
---
We're in a state where A. levels past 100 are pretty much vanity or respec since you have all the build options you could want prior to that  and B. the MAIN method of getting tons of XP isn't waiting forever for events, it's server hopping for fresh spawns. Designers may say "there's plenty of XP all around the map, we don't intend for you to need to do this" but that's not being realistic. Being keenly aware of what players are doing to get around lackluster XP or lack of variation in high level content (being locked to one place on the map and not getting random at-level spawns while exploring low level areas) 
---
It will be a gift to long term players but won't keep players playing
---
I sit about 10,000 rounds of 308 and if it drops below that I take a break from using it and let the ammo build back up. I feel as soon as that number drops below that, it will continue to drop until I have less than 1000 rounds.
---
Hey powerful weapons for all of us, I love it when it happens. :)
---
Killing them is fine, it‚Äôs when you have to go collect your 1* nocturnal fatman that sucks
---
Or leveling up for that matter. How dare they dictate what level I am. I want to sit comfortably at level 16 with one character and 300 with another but nooooo, here have a level up. Just ruins the game.
---
Some people don't like cheaters or cheating themselves and duping is a form of cheating.
---
You must be younger fellow if you think it's fine.
---
I think this is really their way of trying to make the whole map open and a bit of a challenge to all players again. Doesn't matter where you are everything is going to be equally challenging. Makes more areas content for all players without actually adding anything to the game.
---
I've experienced it playing ESO and while it's nice to be able to work as a group with higher level friends, you never really feel all that epic as you get stronger because you still have wolves and small animals that are just as dangerous. You do lose some of that feeling of becoming really epic.
---
Umm, what?
---
How do you make it so all the scorch spawn right by the SAM?
---
had one event like that and was able to tag a TON of them...was awesome...
---
I always just pick one nobody else is sharing
---
I tried to do that yesterday instinctively, but nah.
---
I assume because it would be quite straining on the servers?
---
If they remove them they probably won't put a different one in it's place. It will just be 2750 less score you can get per week.
---
On my pc it hasn't crashed the last 200hours. So i must be lucky
---
Wait what? That's what I was planning to use my scrip on.
---
Is Bethesda aware of this?
---
people dont dupe to spread items around to the community for bargain prices..
---
Lol us unarmed melee guys running around trying to get some hits in while everyone shoots them just as we get there....  :)
---
Level up and NW.
---
Guess I need to delete a character and just start a new character each day to get some easy levels.
---
Yeah the Gatling laser is best ammo efficient
---
You,l find hundreds soon on reddit
---
I wouldnt show off something weird like this lol, the definition of weird flex lol
---
I dread the day where one of the NW daily challenges is to win a match.
---
That‚Äôs how I get my gun powder.
---
It just..... works
---
Spent too long repeatedly spawning at monongah mine with everyone else to open the safe in the trailer.   
---
Quick games, Long Loading.   
---
While we are here.. when is NW coming out of Beta? and Why do I have to go back to main menu every time between games.
---
Still not finishing the event challenge? That's not the public problem, go to the normal event, dun ruins the public event
---
The math is made around doing dailies and non repeatable weeklies dummy.
---
I‚Äôm finding I do a lot more power killing, because of the need to level daily.
---
Same
---
Coolcoolcool
---
Yeah. I am not a fan of this either. Just 2 minutes to select cards. You have to work on it a little bit at a time. 
---
Would be awesome if there was a way to adjust without being in a game, but a boy can dream.
---
I'm with you - I enjoy playing the game as it was intended (bugs and all) instead of trying to find loopholes and exploits to OP myself. I take small pleasure when adventuring and that cha-ching sound pops up from my vendor.  "Oh, someone bought my Dog Food." "Hey someone bought all that excess RadAway sucking up space in my stash for the past two weeks!"  That's how it was designed to work, and ethically I won't use exploits even if it means that my ass will get handed to me on a platter during a big fight.  It's all part of the game.
---
mm that is unfortunate. does it affect the spawn ratios? This was a very big problem in dayz for a long time
---
Scraping was the initial way to get perk points since the first release of the legendary perk system in the PTS, that didnt change.
---
LOL
---
Well played
---
It's an ongoing joke when joining the NW to do dailys...We all pretty much agree in voice chat we could care less about it and are just here for the score points and nothing else. NW is garbage, even the worst battle ground games out are better than Fallouts. I wish they would honestly scrap it completely and put the effort into raids or end game content. NW is a black hole that isn't worth fixing. I know some people will defend it...but lets be real, you're the minority. Games rarely fill even during peak times and if they do its because people are trying to do dailys.
---
Scrap NW and focus on real content people care about because this game mode makes me feel like i'm raising the kid of another man who fucked my wife.
---
Wasn't a lever action...I'm pretty sure a combat rifle from the look of it.
---
Yeah I never use full auto on anything outside of my MG42 when shooting something big. I tend to use short bursts (a leftover habit from my very old Battlefield 2142 days). 
---
Just amazing how 4 players laying in to him and just hops in, drops everyone and hops out with nary a scratch. Things like that really do tend to put you off a mode.
---
Ima be completely honest here, the one who is very clearly mad is you. He is confused on your faulty logic. You think its wrong for people to do smthin you are trying to do while trying to preach from a higher. morale ground you dont have. Y u mad doesnt really work when your complaining about not being able to keep up with other players. All I can honestly say is that you are lack consistent thinking and its evident throughout the post and in your responses. Get over yourself and just play or don't. You are allowed to rant but you cant say one thing applies to someone else but doesnt apply to you.
---
You're hard mate.
---
I have 5/5 characters on my account.
---
300+ lvl main, 160+ lvl alter ego and 68lvl, 79lvl and 51lvl.  
---
I am active on 300+ and 160+ characters, playing them both.  
---
rest of them are just for scripping.
---
they need to make it that if you're on the map and you click join event you get experience for every mob killed if you're in the area of the event even if you don't tag it.
---
Agreed.
---
Also super duper can give a 30% chance to duplicate most crafted items.
---
Same..... Sometimes Bethesda.... üòë
---
I feel like u never toggle PvP on, otherwise u will be more considering instead of acting like low intelligence "wastelander"
---
i was ableto get the bar corner piece to snap to mine last night i put mine in the train can and boxed them in
---
Ohhh okay, this is all stuff within PTS. I play on PS4 and don‚Äôt really hear much about the PTS so I‚Äôm pretty ignorant to the new stuff in there haha
---
You have no evidence. This is fearmongering
---
Ok, but why?
---
The new SPECIAL perks allow you to equip extra perk cards, unlike unyielding bonuses. That‚Äôs what makes them extremely powerful.
---
Let's be clear: there is absolutely NOTHING ethically wrong about duping for a freaking video game gun.  It may piss people off who "worked" for theirs, but the action of duping isn't a moral transgression.  If you let others' actions control your happiness, this sadness you feel will manifest time and again in other aspects of your life.  Not directed at anyone, in particular.
---
I would say so.
---
Paying for Atoms to buy apparel or CAMP items is just aesthetic, but using it for ranks in Seasons to, as you said, unlock Scrip or even Caps, currencies which can be used to then purchase weapons or armor that then make you stronger, faster etc., increase your in-game attributes and therefore I think it can be construe as PTW.
---
What are you talking about bro
---
Dude then what r u complaing about??? Just use em
---
Watching a guy drop hundreds of Gatling plasmas / a video showing the dupe says otherwise.
---
Yeah you would think, but you would also think the digital clock they gave everyone last year would at least show the ingame time or the same time as all the other clocks and not just flash 12:00.
---
Set them as normal walls, apply the wallpaper, then use the "replace" option to change them to windowed. Apparently it persists after you leave the server, etc.
---
I don't get a lot of crashes, either. I DO get the in-game glitches. (A mannequin soaring through the air at Galleria the other day was a magnificent sight to see! Fly free, friend!)
---
Ah I see
---
Thanks!!!
---
Well, my attempt end here.I am not familiar with how PS works :(
---
 I wish you good luck.
---
wdym only pussys play with pacifist on
---
While I wouldn‚Äôt mind this at all. 
---
I‚Äôd also like something new that builds the world over just the same things as from the past.
---
Yep, this alone makes the update exciting.  Agreed that the rest are mostly meh, but additional SPECIAL is a very welcome addition.  My fellow legacy wastelanders would agree.
---
It's a glitched, place a survival tent at the middle spawn point of the gate, save time n easy xp
---
They did power army dirty in this one, fire lining and antivenom don‚Äôt even apply to PA, and here I was hoping for a decent perk for PA, guess it‚Äôs Legendary Ability for me
---
I hate NW, because I suck at it and have had less than a dozen kills in the 29 levels I've achieved.  Mostly I just play hide and seek.  I'm only playing it right now to get the SCORE points, but that's all I really do.  I did rack up enough points when I realized I had 50 something PERK packs to open that I seem to have unlocked a bunch of extra things from Halloween or Christmas I guess.  I just finally got the Slocum Joe PA paint too.  I think I may try my hide and seek tactic when the double NW week runs. Now I have Aqua Boy, maybe I'll just go hide in water instead of bushes too.
---
With standard armor's legendary roll stacking, and now the backpack, PA only has the hidden resistance boost from parts on the frame. That's about all it has going for it now. And that's before these LE perks coming out for standard armor.
---
Honestly, if nothing else, I would settle for a perk that just completely blocked poison and disease completely while in full PA set.
---
Sure you can! They're just ALSO Bethesda games (Skyrim, Fallout 4...) Actually, Skyrim crashes FAR more often on my PC than 76 does.
---
It's up now:) Atleast in Aus
---
76 doesn't have anywhere near good enough FPS mechanics for a competitive shooter. It's totally fine for adventure mode and normal gameplay but when you put that into competitive multiplayer it becomes how clearly jank the controls are.
---
Also on base consoles the game looks awful graphically because of the trees and bushes. Not sure what they did to lower quality on them but I genuinely can't see a few metres in front of me if I'm in a forest area. Again its fine in the normal game mode but it makes NW a pain in the ass because I can't ever spot players in forest areas
---
Throw a prime receiver on it, crafting ultracite .308 makes it as efficient as the other weapons though you do need to farm the flux.
---
.... you're the one who said "At least 2000 per wave", I was using YOUR math.  You're the one who was making it sound like getting 2K xp per wave was some amazing thing.  If I bothered with 4 lunchboxes, max inspirational, max int with unyielding, Cranberry Nuka Cola, well rested, and herbavoir Cranberry relish I'd be doing far more than that doing ghouls.  The XP for the ghouls is on par or better, with less risk, no waiting for an event to pop up, and no worries about what any other player is doing.  
---
And more to the point, I don't care about you wanting to exploit the game.  Let's make sure we are using the proper terms.  The event itself is not glitched, if no one puts their tents up, the event runs "properly".  You are trying to argue in favor of: 1.) intentionally exploiting the event which has server implications and 2.) people being mindful of how they exploit so everyone exploits.   you're trying to argue a "proper" way to exploit.  
---
You get that, right? You're trying to argue in favor of a way to cheat the game. You want cheaters to be ethical.  Do you understand the irony in that? 
---
I have no sympathy for the people trying to exploit the event like that.
---
actually you'll find he wasn't copying his pathing but using objects assigned to cats with their animations, this goes all the way back to fallout 4, if you leave dogmeat in a settlement with several dogs and a doghouse, they will all flock to that doghouse
---
Ammo does have a limit. I've tested it out and max amount of 556 ammo a fresh character can carry is around 1.7 million rounds. You're talking to someone who dropped 336million rounds cause I over duped and wanted access to my stash again. Which was 1.6 million over 800.
---
He's better than you. 
---
That's competition
---
Did you place it at the pond at the very south on the golf course?
---
&gt;Also , there is no content to play that long for grinding all fully upgraded cards
---
This is one of my biggest issues with the proposed system, too. The new Legendary Ability card sounds awesome, OP, even... except, to get it to a point where it could make a major difference in your build, you'd need to grind out *hundreds* of levels first. And there's *no way* I'm planning my build around what I *might* be able to do in a year, *if* I grind constantly... I'm not certain I'll even make it to the end of the Season before I burn out again and wander off to other games for a while.
---
The time requirements are just excessive, particularly since you'll have to go so long before having anything to show for it. Honestly, I think I'd rather they mimicked Diablo 3's Paragon system, with getting much smaller bonuses per rank, but being able to increase ranks far more frequently. For an example, just as a thought... one could be "increased VATS hit chance", and have it give just +0.2% per rank, but with 100 ranks (and being able to increase *at least* one per every level up) - meaning you'd get a +20% bonus once maxed out.
---
The timer and the lag made the raids a truly miserable experience.
---
"public event"  "!" pointed events reward treasury notes. i do not suffer from any inability to do my challenges.
---
Are you running the game off said external?
---
Why are you like these? If you don't link one part of the game mode just don't play it, THINK about the "minority", people who really loves playing NW and want to get it involved and have more chances to get the SCORE points. 
---
For the love of god, stop asking to remove the challenges from NW you sound so F selfish, stop thinking about YOUR needs and think about the other people who really plays NW. 
---
Annnnd, the challenges are pretty easy to do, the don't require skill and just a advice, if you are going to play JUST for the challenges turn off the fill on, that way you won't affect people that really likes the game mode.
---
Saying something doesn't mean it's true.
---
Look, I can do it: I saw a guy dropping hundreds of B2525 handmades!!!!!!
---
Blue screen is probably something on your end.
---
fucking hell man. i knew i should have tried to do valuable trades before this happened. i bet rare masks are literal garbage now
---
I mean, don't buy a suspicious amount or overpay... I'm not condoning duping, but buying something that was duped won't affect your account and you don't really know if it's legit or not. So for now, just don't pay or trade high value for anything.
---
I also feel like low intelligence is not being able to recognize your hypocrisy, cause complaining about people doing something you want to do before you do it is such a lil bitch complaint and there is probably a huge correlation to your ability to do well on anything because you constantly think you are above everyone else. You claim higher ground when you are trying to dig yourself back to average
---
I saw a guys vendor had thousands, I mean honestly it might stabilize the weapon economy lol
---
Explosive also drops durability, it works off a hit scan system so you only Lose durability when attack something. In the case of TSE you lose 4x the durability when you attack a mob and crazy amount if you fire into a swarm of enemies
---
I only whip out the AGL when someone is sitting on the hill past the front gates with a Gauss shotgun one shotting entire groups of mobs at once when they spawn. I encounter those people WAY more often then explosives users.
---
You can't do anything to a team member's camp on a public team, you've got to be on a private team.
---
I got a quad plasma caster, it's actually really fun, I'd recommend getting one with a faster fire rate, quad and bloodied. It'd be a solid build for the caster.
---
Bruv a simple google could check
---
Will that ammo factory stack with ammosmith to produce 230% more ammo or?
---
Now they are pretty meh
---
The playerbase is split some think it be too easy and don‚Äôt like that but some think the whole map will be too difficult and player will have to be conscious when it come to picking a fight 
---
Myself I hope the whole map is more difficult and make the game more group oriented
---
Except they ARE forced to play it with how grindy the season is. Unless you're doing absolutely every other challenge and don't miss out on any days then you're forced to do it
---
Ahahaha you‚Äôve got a point there buddyüòÇ &amp; no mans sky but the game just got released on game pass &amp; in its current state not a bad game to dabble in for fun. Dupe glitches too, unless I was so blind to the cheating scene I can‚Äôt think of any multiplayer games with this many duping issues
---
I never run events for the spawn XP.  I think that's silly.  More so I don't care for anyone trying to exploit the event. 
---
Events on public servers are a horrible way in general to farm XP or legendaries, too many factors (primarily the human element) that can mess it up. Now we have people exploiting them and getting mad that people are "Exploiting wrong"
---
Just did. Nothing. Nothing on YouTube either
---
I think they should do a hard ban on anyone who duped like clear amounts oh you magically got 20,000 B2525 fixers hard ban em. I enjoy dupes to get like outfits / masks but having the best weapons/armor ruins the game
---
Man, that guy got super buttsore hilariously fast
---
DO NOT MAKE ONE!
---
it has extra durability and takes ages to break enough to repair it
---
Not saying the name of the person but they are an avid exploiter and I am done talking to you.
---
10 atoms.
---
That would be awesome! People who don't have the items could come to your arcade and spend caps. There's a real potential for some good role play options at camps. We can already play a trader /shop,bar and coffee shop owner.
---
The game is installed to my external but I have to use the disc. Not sure if that answers your question.
---
yes they remove that ages light years ago.....
---
Thanks for the heads up, however I can't find any in the world so my options are pretty limited :(
---
There's one at the palace of winding path near the archery range
---
I applaud this guys ego and his ability to not recognize his hypocrisy.
---
The solution for both the flower pickers and PvPers is simply to make SCORE equally attainable through both modes. I'm so GD bored with adventure right now, I'd rather just play NW but I can't really progress with SCORE that way. 
---
Just cap the amount of SCORE from dailies and make it so you can get it through adventure, Nw or both.
---
I've checked and it was way too high level, after server skipping a few times it still didn't respawn
---
I was going to suggest that but, at that point, allowing people to spend caps makes it 'pay to win'.
---
Hopefully patch 22
---
it doesn't go any higher than 15 still, though. unless you're a food build there's not much utility in that. seeing as how any real build will have 15 of their preferred stats already.
---
Yeah, I've been starting a new character if I'm way off on xp for my main.  The level you get in the vault doesn't count but all you need to do is basically get to the Overseers camp and then speak with Duchess and you get another level.  Takes 10 minutes tops.
---
I fucking called it they called me crazy for trading the plan but I knew
---
Agreed. At level 340 my leveling has slowed way down. And I doubt I'll have much to do with these cards at this point. Might get a few at r1. But it seems like a huge pain
---
impatiently awaiting lil ginger snuggles.
---
Wow. I had no idea half these perks weren‚Äôt even working.  I have 5 points wasted into adrenaline on one of my dudes and never realized it wasn‚Äôt doing anything versus the queen. Lol.
---
you don't know where to look. it's real.
---
and they missed Teddy Fear! The best teddy
---
Yea exactly the Lil pond with the 2/3 mirelurk spawns. Left side of the pond.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just me. But two minutes is more than enough time. There are only 7 cards you can have. Most of the time I keep everything the same, except maybe move a card or two. Then I select the map. And I still have to wait another minute just standing there seeing people punch each other and use emotes.
---
I'm melee and due to serums am pretty much crippled when it comes to gun damage so I throw a mine down just before each wave spawns. Does hardly any damage but just enough to get tags on most of them.
---
why would you not take advantage of this? I don't get people complaining about the market on one hand and refusing free weapons on the other.
---
Yes please!!!!! For the love of Todd shut it down!
---
Blocking and reporting will keep you from being placed with them again, usually. The tricky thing is the one that shoots you isn't the "real" user sometimes, and you have to figure out who they were teamed with by watching them after they kill you and blocking and reporting all of them that were hanging around the bot that was killing everyone.
---
I wonder if the only people concerned about this dupe are those who have the good stuff and dictate prices cos personally i don't actually care
---
yes i know that. they fix that as if you read the leatest  patch update. Why you guys let the op to explain? why are you answering FOR him? something fishy here
---
realistically, the bears are probably made in china.
---
I would add that serendipity doesn‚Äôt PRoc in power armor despite not having a warning on the perk card!
---
Wait nvm it came back i think it randomly screws up but just in case im gonna be checking on this
---
i have an anti armor explosive faster aim handmade if youre interested
---
someone stole the three-star minigun to the vendor because they were trying to dupe it but you caught them in the middle of it and messed up their dupe.
---
It's mind-blowing that an MORPG with no safe and reliable way to transfer items between characters exists in 2020.
---
well if you make one you can bash things to damage it quicker
---
Same. It doesnt effect how I play. I know people say it screws the in game economy (which it does) but the economy evens itself out after bit.
---
My recent bullshit is it'll get stuck loading.
---
So I'll make my way to a place to enter to get shit done &amp; I'm all ready &amp; the loading screen freezes. Of course I've gotta start the prep all over again &amp; hope it don't freeze again etc.
---
I curse up a storm.
---
I hear if you go to a foreign server with a friend in it (like your buddy in the UK), select your best gun at the vendor and bring up the trade confirmation screen, then open the social menu and join another friend, spamming x/a as you load out, then joining back on the foreign server and opening up the vendor, it fixes it.
---
Honestly. They really lean into the whole role play make your own story, yet give very you little to actually build such a role playing environment. They let you build little bits and pieces (unless you want to build a cafe or bar for some reason) of a theme but never a whole dedicated set. I get frustrated sometimes finding creative/backwards ways of building to make things seem half legit. And for higher level characters who have done almost everything get nothing camp-wise to match such outstanding leveling and questing.
---
Perk Coins, Perk Cards, Scrip, Reputation, Atoms, bullion, SCORE.... on and on it goes, grind after repetitive grind under the guise of ‚Äòengagement‚Äô and ‚Äòcontent‚Äô FFS.
---
And people thought Preston Garvey was a twat with his radiant quests...
---
I would love to know what causes that (PS4) Blue screen because not a single other game does that to me.
---
they can't exactly shut down critical mechanics whenever there's a new exploit.
---
the average player is just gonna be angry he can't get their daily caps.
---
That‚Äôs pretty impossible but that would be awful. The survive for 30 minutes one wasn‚Äôt the worst but it just means hiding for a few matches.
---
How are you using mods?
---
I have a cliff C.A.M.P. so I stuck her in a garden shed at the bottom of the cliff.  I almost never hear her now.  So peaceful!
---
No its not that really. Its just i enjoy trading and this dupe juat killed this content. I dont have any god fixers or such.
---
The thing is that I can't make one for a few levels, therefore my question if I can provide someone with the materials (or caps) to make one for me
---
Can you point me in the direction?
---
I only wish I could get in on it. Work is real.
---
I just saved up 1000 scrip exactly to (hopefully) get a god role 3\* weapon. I know I can dream!
---
seriously though. my other only other option was calling a courier from the trade forum, but i transfer stiff multiple times a day.
---
Well, thet should be happy with this response versus the response to their first attempt. There really seems to be something for everyone.
---
Yeah unfortunately thats what people would claim. I personally thought it would be cool if the slocums Joe came with some donut /coffee recipes like in fallout 4 to sell to players but again it might be seen as p2w even though I'd disagree that it is. I guess it will never happen because it will bring more complaints
---
Because some people like to play a game without cheating. Don't worry you'll understand when you're older.
---
No one was there. It was a faster fire rate also and it‚Äôs my next best one to my bloodied 3 star I got from purveyor. I also bought the junkie Gatling plasma they sold and something else I spent 4K caps and it was so worth it. How do they dupe using a vendor?
---
Not that it makes it much better (can't be bothered doing the actual maths), but with the new seasons that will be the norm from now on you get perk card packs. Did you factor that in or was it just cards from levelling?
---
[This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1945e8&amp;d=ej4l71lu2a72ee2a01a12c72a42am2ir2la2i40ii0sf2ss2si0sg2se2sj0pe0s50&amp;w=lt2p10c12ce0ip2sq2s32sr2sb2sx2c52eh2&amp;m=c29fe8gh3&amp;nw=&amp;n=) is what I used to kill the Queen solo with a switchblade. With 2 handed you‚Äôre kinda over killing it with that many points in slugger. You‚Äôd be better off leaving them at 1 point each, adding Barbarian to tank more damage, and adding martial artist so you can move from enemy to enemy faster since they‚Äôll all be 1 shot anyway
---
Well, all I can do is tell you what happened. I'll lay it out sequentially to avoid confusion.
---
1. While in a crafting menu, I am shot by another player
---
2. I leave the menu, turn around, and start firing 40mm grenades at him and his party.
---
3. By the time I get a few grenades off, his companions have started shooting back at me, thus engaging PVP and negating the reduced damage effect.
---
4. I continue to fire, strafing all of them with 40mm grenades until they all die. Was it two hits exactly? I didn't count.
---
But that's what happened.
---
Did you ever wonder why we got a new expansion where everything  new is character locked?  
---
This is how duping affects you.  It changes gameplay development.
---
Ok, nice, that is the one I just found last night.  Been debating if I could find a better place.  Hopefully those mirelurks don't eat my purifiers too fast lol
---
I was just thinking the same. "Oh! You mean what I said in front of everyone was wrong? How awkward! I'll just make personal statements against people and leave." - every Karen/Daren ever
---
I mean I get what I can get but I just prefer not being top tier gear wise because what‚Äôs the point of playing lol
---
I wish that I could go to the vault without being in a lobby so I can seg my perks and really explore the vault rather than running to the random holotapes and computers and basically speedreading everything.
---
Just saw demon posted a video but I guess maybe they did it and disconnnected or something
---
My wife has a Mirelurk King at her base there and it definitely doesn't do what Murgle does. They seem to at least get along though.
---
Events are made to be completed, don't tell others how to enjoy the game. If I wanted to sit around and do nothing I would go fishing.
---
They shut down player vending machines for like weeks earlier this summer lol what are you talking about?
---
No ones saying he's not good...but downing 13 of the first 18 kills right from the start waltzing through groups like that...doesn't make for the best of games. 
---
How is it enjoyable to players when it's so easy for some players. I have heavy armour and take two hits and dead, he has light (or medium armour...not sure, hard to tell when bouncing about) and takes lots of hits but no problem. Is it really just about being lucky enough to find the one weapon that lets you almost autokill other players? Is it about memorizing the spawns for equipment?
---
"""""Low durability"""""
---
Go do Riding Shotgun, the captain always shows up as a legendary. Usually a 3* at level 100. Plus any of his level 60 minions can be legendary too so no matter if any of them show up legendary, all the gear you get from them will be max level. I got a furious faster fire rate LMG from the captain one time.
---
I hear the lines at station vendors right now are like Black Friday after Thanksgiving lol
---
Yeah, I've done it some but I'm afraid they'll regard it as an exploit (even though they shouldn't, considering how easy it should be to fix for them) and I wouldn't want to get banned because of it.
---
so it's to satisfy a misguided sense of superiority? I guess that checks out. still doesn't explain why anyone in that position would complain about the market, though. seeing as how the ludicrous rng is part of the game.
---
 [u/ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ladydevann/)
---
Yeah and I think I‚Äôm last line
---
Story keeps changing:
---
First only 1 shot and they didn't have chance to shoot back but all died anyways. 
---
Now they ALL shot and did have chance to shoot back. 
---
Weak story is weak.
---
[fed76.info](https://fed76.info/weapons/) estimates that this would be worth around 3000-6300 caps.
---
Awesome. Thanks for the tip!
---
Exactly I used to love duping but I remember when I was playing border lands 2 and I got fully duped over 1000 hours played daily and bam just stopped no interest in the game.
---
I fucking love it. Such a great little song. Crank it up!!
---
Wife just sent me a screenshot of the map and there are like 20 people at white spring station in the servers she‚Äôs in right now lol
---
I dont think they have, and I'm not sure they understand what you meant and took it rather literally.
---
I think it's safe to say your point was for the people min maxing and following the best builds, then yes the game will be easy with how it is now and with the upcoming change.
---
If I misunderstood let me know.
---
agreed, there should be one, or at least a fee based escrow/mail system. its another basic entry level online mechanic that is missing.
---
There's stuff to read ?!! Didn't even know that. 
---
How do i get through the security barriers? Level up?
---
That's at the higher end of what it's worth. i'd reckon 4-5k would be better. but hey. It's your caps, man
---
would you take it
---
i don't agree with exploits, but this is idiotic.
---
Yes if that‚Äôs the case then I also hope for that. Also, would we never get any low level legendaries? If all enemies are their max level. If so that‚Äôs awesome at least!
---
Bunches of AOE spammer in the event come in and showing they are not even familiar with the event's objective and the participants'. Oh they are probably the one who deposited the ores and finish the Radiation Rumble early while others are grinding XP because they want to WIN
---
you do realize you could play for decades and still not get a perfect set of 3\* gear, right? because of how the rng works.
---
most of the good stuff has been duped before. I can count in one hand the top tier gear I have that's legit. same goes for literally everyone else.
---
I usually share bloody mess. I would share adrenaline if it worked.
---
Yeah man,  I lost 1800 gunpowder once which wasnt even a big loss and since that day I only use other people to move stuff if it's something I would be upset if I lost.  It sucks but it is what it is.  Hopefully someday we can get this basic QOL feature that has existed in MORPG games since their inception.
---
Also converting 10x and 100x the usual amount. Plus one less screen to advance through.
---
Can confirm Unyielding helps immensely for XP, but the 100 SCORE from the XP challenge doesn't seem to make a massive difference if you're a very casual player, although it makes it way easier to get the daily level up, and I imagine if you're grinding out XP it'd make a bigger difference. I'm running a bloodied unarmed build with a full stack of Unyielding armor and 14 base intelligence, and I've been \*racking\* up the XP.  
---
GF and I have been playing roughly about the same amount (like 2-3 hours a day, just completing all the dailies and maxing daily currencies) and I'm only 2-3 tiers ahead on the run (I think I just got the UFO playground thingy or the perk card after it). We've completed every daily challenge but have been skipping most of the NW challenges.
---
on PC, and i've had this problem on and off since survival mode was introduced, but after wastelanders dropped it has been non-stop for every character and bugs me to high hell. 
---
if i have to miss an event completion just trying to gain control again or hear the start up audio to encrypted one more \*\*\*\*ing time i'm going to lose it.
---
Thank you. So i shouldn buy it?
---
Ha!
---
I've never heard Daten before 
---
I thought it was Kevin
---
Thats true lol i‚Äòm not even frustrated or angry if it happens anymore.
---
After so many hours it feels more like a game mechanic.
---
player vending is nowhere near as critical as vendor bots.
---
I find it the worst because I will be about 2 minutes away from completing the challenge and then die to some rando that came from behind. Then I would have to wait in the menu for 2 minutes to find a lobby and then wait another 5 minutes in the vault to fill the lobby, pick the map, and then pick the spawn. and then die to a 4 man team that happened to pick the 1 very obscured spawn point that I usually pick due to no one ever picking it. and then having to wait another 7 to 10 minutes to get into another match.
---
Right in the tadpole place there's one at the spot where you take the shooting test
---
That way the owner knows that you are finished at their CAMP, if they're not present. Then we don't get the "Check your CAMP before you log off" posts.
---
I assume this stuff is being posted in the actual PTS forum endlessly right? Because that‚Äôs the feedback that kinda matters, even if they choose to purposefully misunderstand the point of the complaint and make it worse rather than better, which appears to have happened here. 
---
I usually don‚Äôt attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity, but I refuse to believe stupidity can extend to presumably multiple people in a game dev company, where they interpret a complaint about feeling you have to scrap good cards for 5 coins to make ANY sort of dent in progress, means you want that reduced and then to be worth the same as basic cards so you don‚Äôt feel compelled to scrap then. 
---
I literally refuse to believe that wasn‚Äôt a purposeful decision and intentional misinterpretation of the complaint.
---
Oh yeah let the entire economy tank to the gutter just so little Billy can get his 1400 caps per day.  Give me a break, this issue is bigger than daily caps.
---
If you mean the crafting recipe, I've already picked it up. The problem still remains that I can't craft the thing, if you mean an actual crossbow I can't seem to find it on the wiki
---
No I didnt, i understood. But that's not going to stop glitches from happening until the game starts to stabilize. The way I look at it is it's just a matter of waiting it out.
---
I mean yes hence why I said what I said, once you‚Äôre fully maxed what‚Äôs the point in playing and one hitting everything? Only thing I have that‚Äôs duped is a TSE50
---
Only comes in .38 rounds since we have the ammo converter lol
---
The drop will be our lvls so if you lvl5 then you get lvl5 legendary but lvl50+ will be lvl40-50 legendary (some weapon cap at lvl40 or 45 I think)
---
No worries. Just trying to help plp out there üëç
---
I like "Karen/Daren". Are we not going with "Karen/Brad"? ...I heard it was "Brad".
---
27
---
Yes when you level up you get access to different areas of the vault and different things to read and listen to so you can hear the history of the Vault and why you're doing a battle royal in the first place
---
Awesome! That‚Äôs a huge step actually
---
Not a bad price if you dont think youll come across another one. I have a Junkies UGL but id buy it if i saw it for 6 K
---
Same here. Doesnt happen with FO4, Titanfall 2, shadow or any other game I play regularly.
---
So, why should a challenge be removed because you loathe that gameplay, but a challenge I want removed because I loathe that gameplay is essentially 'suck it up, soldier'?
---
The only other game that has given my PS4 blue screens is heavily modded Fallout 4
---
totally agreed. my reality is putting together this second computer and trading to myself, cause this is bullshit.
---
Only one shot *at first*. Once I started shooting, they started shooting back. The amount of shooting back they did was very small, which is why I said that they really didn't get a chance (to do damage, for example).
---
Tired of every game just adding a new form of currency and obsoleting the old every time they think they are expanding the game.
---
One of them is most likely me waiting for a explosive Gatling plasma
---
literally anything would be more useful than its current state.
---
You don't need multiple on one PC, people also set up an overlay so their teammates twitch stream is visible in the corner of the screen, so when one dies they can disclose enemy locations. You can do the same on xbox and PS4 also using two consoles or a cell phone.
---
It blows my mind what people come up with in their builds!! This is really cool. üòç 
---
Mine‚Äôs just a plain ol‚Äô house. üòÇ
---
The design appears to be a combination of the layout of the Georgia Guidestones (1980), with the text being a nod to the Horse Creek Petroglyphs (undated, though generally attributed to the natives who lived in the area until the mid-17th century). The IRL Horse Creek Petroglyphs are just scratches in the back of a rock shelter, so it doesn't resemble the layout of the guidestones in-game at all. Similarly, the Georgia Guidestones have text in English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Traditional Chinese, Russian, Babylonian Cuneiform, Classical Greek, Sanskrit, and Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs, which does not resemble the strange markings in-game. By combining the markings of the petroglyphs and the layout of the guidestones, it appears Bethesda wanted to make two references at once.
---
"little billy" makes up for 90% of the playerbase. this sub and discord groups don't represent the bulk of it. we're just the more "hardcore" players.
---
there's a ton of people who are completely unaware of what a dupe even is. and they'd be really angry if Bethesda shut vendors for a month until they figure out a fix, because caps are still their lifeline.
---
this may come as a shock but casual players actually rely on those mechanics to a massive extent.
---
Look at the Weekly challenge where the XP challenge is listed, there's a XXXX/10,0000 counter there.
---
Ahh I didn't think of that.  This is a valid point i guess.
---
idk if it means the whole map is usable to actually participate in as a high level this is a win imo . Having 1 area as the high level zone for 2 years is so fucking dumb
---
I mean they do but the issue I can see is they can‚Äôt ban players who buy duped weapons because they don‚Äôt know, but banning people that clearly have 3004&amp;473638 pounds is a safe bet lol, I remember when the dupe wave started after beta that all my friends who did it got banned, also think people would lie about why they got banned and say ‚Äú I never duped I‚Äôm a good boy Bethesda is horrible!‚Äù And everyone would agree because Todd bad
---
Where did you find a tamable cat? I've only ever encountered monsters at the random event locations with tamable stuff.
---
Lots of games have stuff character locked. And then sometimes after a while they open stuff to your account (like WoW)
---
Actually i lied. I cared when they took player vendors away as i had to go and make ammo like some kind of peasant.
---
That's expected and excepted as you are messing with the game. This 76 thing is on a whole other level. Don't get wrong i love it. It's just really hard on my PS.
---
Awesome, now I can cash in and not spend the points until I need the ammo so it will lessen how much I have to carry.
---
Yup pretty much at least once every few games wish they would fix it
---
I don't play NW on the regular but here are some tips to complete the dailies quick.
---
Unload the public Teams before you log in and than hide in barren locations on the map. Only move when the fire moves and stick close to the ring of the fire for the 30 minute daily.
---
Lock is located here to unlock. You don't have to wait for the match to be over, just unlock and disconnect. https://imgur.com/a/6Dw7nfH
---
You can revive people without stimpacks, so make a friend in the normal game, team, log into NW and spawn next to the circle of fire, have them suicide in the fire and then revive them.
---
Camps can be placed over and over again just in a slighty differnt location.
---
Containers (Trash cans, news stands) have  a high probability of build items and stimpacks in them, so spawn next to a train station that has a bunch of trashcans and just build all the items as you find them or run to the fire and stimpak youself.
---
Becides the 30 minutes in NW daily, you should be able to do most dailys in a few minutes.
---
It's different for every barrier, holo, etc. If you try walking into a barrier that you can't get into it will display the level needed to enter it in the top left. And it says on the holos and computers what level you need to be to use them.
---
Nope.
---
I didn't. I thought about it but figured it was negligible.
---
Just looked, it's 13 packs per season, so 52 cards over three months IF you max SCORE it. So that's 2 extra legendary ranks per year if you do four full seasons. While that IS helpful, that's... A lot of work for two extra ranks.
---
In the map screen, below the blue bar at the top right it shows the level you are on, how many score points you have and the number needed to unlock next level. 
---
So if you had done 300 score towards the next level it would show 300/score needed to hit next level.
---
Memory most likely. This game is bad at optimal memory use, especially with Microsoft Windows memory random address relocation map schemes. Had a few of these myself.
---
Here, hold my *Orbital Strike Beacon*.
---
I don't do bloodied. And there's better guns out there BUT if it's better than what you have now. Go for it. Offer 5k maybe.Or offer 4k and let them talk you up to 5k
---
It‚Äôs pretty clear to me that they really just didn‚Äôt work on this part of things yet. They simplified the trade in part, but still need to work on the values. The new perk cards don‚Äôt even have artwork. It‚Äôs clearly a work in progress. Public release is months away, there‚Äôs plenty of time to address the perk coin value calculation. 
---
The focus here was clearly ‚ÄúHere are some new perks, are these better?‚Äù
---
Ok cheers.
---
Not saying stand by idly, obviously work on a patch. But dont shut down the game because in another week or another month there will be a new glitch. 
---
The people who do dupe will eventually get bored with the game because they broke it for themselves, and once the game stabilizes and there are not new dupes for awhile they will start to drop off. By that time more than likely there will also be new Meta's that will make most of what they have not that great.
---
36.
---
Still not fixed
---
That was really neat, thank you for sharing\~
---
Grahm sells the plans for 200 caps or another person can build it for you at your camp.
---
I like how you think you get to make up new objectives for the event.
---
Thank you :)
---
go farm turning on poseidon. its a possible reward from the quest
---
I'm sure they'll get over it.  Either this patch is going to get hotfixed like the last one with no downtime or they are gonna shut them down.  They did it last time with exploits so they will do it again.
---
Base off eso system if they do it just like that 
---
Only base lvl is sync the difference in feeling more powerful come from your build and equipment
---
Even the Mole Miner was yelling about it.
---
It is party memorizing the spawns 
---
It's also the cards you have slotted
---
But mostly- and this is the really big one- most people absolutly suck when going against someone smarter than the average AI enemy
---
People get really used to the fact that there isn't a single enemy in this game that uses anything actually resembling combat tactics and it is hard for them to adjust to a really real person
---
Also, I've noticed that a lot of people seem to have utterly terrible target acquisition skills. It's nearly impossible to beat someone in a fight if you don't see them first 
---
I am speced into commando weapons and I can fairly regularly take out an entire team if I pick up an assault rifle, handmade, or even combat rifle. Esspecially if they don't see me coming. And I'm an average skilled player at best 
---
Sometimes you just run into someone better than you. That's competition
---
Hmm I asked clear questions so you could of cleared it up then but you kept it close to the original. You only started the change things about the story the second I mentioned the big plot hole about team tagging. 
---
Whatever if you need to post even a real story about how you bullied a group of low levels instead of keeping your composer as a higher level and ignoring them. Knowing they couldn't do anything. 
---
Or a fake story regarding the same issue. 
---
Both seem pretty bad tbh.
---
I guess it depends. personally I'm way past that point and still play religiously. it just seems counterproductive, you say the point of playing is to get better gear yet to refuse said gear unless it took months to get. or a strike of luck.
---
&gt;Only thing I have that‚Äôs duped is a TSE50
---
you'd be surprised. if you traded for anything remotely good, chances are it's duped. I have a set of random trapper armor, something that nobody would ever think to dupe. and yet it's a dupe.
---
I believe sometimes you can by a crossbow from the vendors at Whitesprings.
---
When all of your weapons and armor are account-locked, you'll know who to blame.
---
You'll be with the Bethesda launcher and Steam players, unfortunately we don't have cross platform support
---
yeah, i dont even think banning is the right answer, because its easy to make a new account. As software developers, they should know better, items and transactions should be tracked atomically and immutably. There are dozens of ways to do this and ensure it logically cant be circumvented, to not have it by now, is just terrible.
---
Yeah as I said I couldn't be bothered doing the maths, thanks for checking it though, appreciate it.
---
No worries. I just want to share what I know.. &amp; thank you
---
I set myself a target to find one. End of july 21st (when i'm possibly due back at work). I've already passed 100 hours looking for one. So i imagine if they've been duped to hell they'll be out there by then. Either way i'll be getting one. Don't really care for guns tbh. I just wanna look nice D:
---
I'll make sure to check, thanks
---
Giving gold cards the same coin value as standard cards was a good thing. There's just too much inconsistency in getting gold cards of different ranks, or getting more than one gold card from a pack. That's a different conversation from the actual value of perk coins and the cost of upgrading legendary perks, which pretty much everyone agrees is too much. 
---
The answer isn't reverting the change to gold cards, it's increasing the coin value of ALL cards and/or reducing the cost of upgrading legendary perks.
---
I'm looking on xbox in the  game pass it doesn't show up and when I find it in the store it's still full price.
---
I had to relog a few times because Dr. Emerson would show up in my camp, I'd start dialogue with Daguerre which should prompt Emerson to burst in with his big ulterior motive reveal.
---
Except, he just wouldn't.  I'd be stuck in dialogue and he'd be at my stove cooking something. I finally relogged, removed the bloody stove, locked my front door and gave him a clearer path to daguerre.
---
That eventually worked.
---
&gt;The people who do dupe will eventually get bored with the game because they broke it for themselves, and once the game stabilizes and there are not new dupes for awhile they will start to drop off. 
---
You are wrong.  The vast majority of people dupe do not do it for personal use.  They do it for RMT.  They sell it for real money.  Don't believe me go check the RMT sites for new postings today and look at the carnage.  This is a job for some people sadly enough.  They aren't going anywhere.
---
couldnt have made the model unique doe
---
I think they should make every new weapon require bullion and any dupes are a hard account ban no appeal
---
I don't like the idea of One Wasteland at all. I like giving my Handmades a rest and wandering the Forest with a 10mm, you know?
---
I'm not a hardcore immersion player but I like the idea that some areas are reasonably survivable only after we've become better player characters (leveled up). Remember how exciting it was to infiltrate Watoga or the Bog for the first time?
---
On the bright side, maybe if we get enough threads like this they will back off and do something else, like making the low level areas more interesting and rewarding for low levels.
---
What are YOU talking about ?
---
whatever you say. it doesn't really reflect the playerbase, though. why do you think is that they didn't ban anyone for the display glitch?
---
Shit as.   
---
What platform?
---
I have an AAE HM on an alt. I use it for levelling from 45.
---
Eso is thriving now and it consider one of the top mmorpg in the market , the one tamerial is credited as the update that saved it
---
All of them !
---
It feels like that, doesn't it?
---
I felt the same way about the ammo converter. "Oh, you have complained since launch about this and begged repeatedly for this small QOL that existed in our previous game? Here. Have fun."
---
Even if they just don't play the game at all, it's like they didn't even read anything about what players wanted in the first place. I too have a really hard time empathizing with it just being 'an oversight'. It's so frustrating because so many of us love this universe and game series and see what this game COULD be.
---
Literally last night after Free Range. My partner's encumbered so I waypoint in to keep a cow alive long enough for others to join the event and help defend it while he offloads his shit. The sheepsquatch pops, we all get our hits on it, I see it go down - disconnected right to main menu. Reader, I screamed. Luckily my partner was still on the map so I pop back in and the corpse was still there with all my loot, and my dailies updated appropriately. Just... constant disconnects for me this week while my partner sits behind me with a stable connection. I have no idea why this game in particular is so fickle.
---
You can almost guarantee that it's coming.
---
It‚Äôs a vendor
---
Just track accounts as well as you can and if you find an odd transaction or transfer flag it
---
Because it‚Äôs much easier to go find a legendary than it is to play a round of nuclear winter trying to do a challenge. 
---
You could go to whitesprings golf club and find one not meaning to, meanwhile people are having trouble even getting into NW because of some endless loading screen bug going around, takes 3 or 4 tries of closing the game out to even get into a match, and even then you could get into that match and some dickwad finds a gun and kills you before you can complete your objectives, back to trying to get into another match 3 or 4 times...
---
If they‚Äôre going to add challenges to the game mode, they could at least make sure the bloody game mode WORKS first.
---
I want it, being able to craft / pick specific mods made it a hell of a lot easier for me to enjoy the game, just make gold easier to get please lol
---
Now's a good time to be milling around stations you see other people milling around at.
---
Oh hell yes. Limiting it to 20 gold a day is ridiculous. I have over 1200 Treasury Notes in my inventory right now.
---
what make u think that AGL is a weapon that "not being bale to keep up"? I m actually enjoy to watch dude like you jump in and replying with some interesting arguments, like "I want to play in the way what I want","U dun satisfied go to private world","blank minigun take mobs before AOE spam" and etc, and whats the thing u mean that " applies to someone else but doesnt apply to you" exactly? I never 1 shot everything juz want to "WIN"
---
The new legendary perks look pretty good
---
if only there was some technology that was like a 'ledger' that would keep track of 'transactions' ...hmmmmmmmmmmmmm i wonder.
---
If you're server hopping anyway, when you're at the Pioneer Scout Camp in the Toxic Valley, go to the archery range and check for the Crossbow blueprint. It usually spawns up there on a table.
---
(random hordes of heavy metal machine gun ghouls that run around yelling "dakka-dakka-dakka")

(furiously spraying bullets everywhere with metal music blaring from speakers on their bullet filled backpacks)
---
I'm trying to answer your questions. The point of providing more information is to answer your questions. Correcting myself and clarifying is a part of that. In addition, this is not a bragging story. This is an apology for trashing those guys and a moment I wanted to share with other people. Finally, I have said before I didn't notice their levels until the end of the encounter. You seem to be willfully taking the worst possible viewpoint of anything I say.
---
It is much easier to finish a NW challenge than find a legendary. For most challenges, at least. 10-seconds for some. 
---
Either way. It doesn't matter. I am against killing legendaries, and thus I do not want to lose rewards for something I ethically do not agree with.
---
I have way to many from events lol just let us do double or triple or make it so events / challenges give gold
---
Use the pad for the cargbots. The Federal Supply Holotapes need a better purpose. Let me feed my personal terminal a holotape that's connected to a small antenna similar to the enclave ones and have the cargobot drop me a crate on my pad... Even if it's junk it's better than doing the current way.
---
100% agree. I can't understand the logic of Bethesda management to try svd implement legendary perks before they've even released perk load outs. Fine tune and fix what's in their now before creating a bigger mess and stop creating new forms of currency
---
(train-horn reload noise)
---
Lol i know it‚Äôs a simple fix but I believe the actual team working on 76 is smaller than people think with high expectations and they need to up the team size.
---
Like what I said, dun behave like a jerk, especially when there are 10+ players waiting there to grind
---
Heh heh - yep.
---
They never discuss stuff like that in the "Inside the Vault."
---
No worries
---
You are not wrong, they do, but again once the game stabilizes and the gear the have is moved out of Meta, they will leave.
---
If its like ESO it wont be bad.
---
Well your in the minority then bud, good luck killing any kinda raid boss with your non legendary gear. Everybody else has no qualms about wasting some friendly NPC that happened to spawn legendary.
---
yeah... you're tanking a multi-billion dollar franchise and you understaff the only project related to it over the next ~10 years? id want heads to roll if i was an investor.
---
It coming in September if you planning on quitting then you might as well do it now
---
Your progress will transfer over to PC or Xbox if you have gamepass ultimate. Since both are connected to your xbox account where you've been making all that progress/purchases from the atomic shop etc. I just got done asking the same questions and got these answers from xbox support staff. Also you can while playing on PC you can interact/play with PC players (also confirmed from xbox support staff).  
---
I'll be getting gamepass ultimate so I can continue playing Fo76 on either PC or Xbox with all my progress tracking between them both.  
---
Hope this helps!
---
Is want the coins gone altogether and just gave it based on level
---
It's all over Facebook and there is even a video on YouTube...
---
Yup, just did it and it wasn't too bad. Maybe I'll combine it with a grind for the Responder fireman uniform you can get from the next quest.
---
hahaha WHAT!? Is there like en EXACT location for that?
---
The score completing early and you getting it... just take that as a gift.
---
The score completing without giving you any.... 
---
1. Don't have the game open at 12:00 noon eastern time when the challenges reset. If you're on console make sure you don't just minimize the game, but completely quit out of it. If on PC make sure it didn't freeze during exit and leave the frozen client open in your task manager.
---
2. Don't enter Nuclear Winter as soon as you open the client without first entering Adventure or a Private Server and exiting back to menu. They said they fixed this problem but I'm not taking any chances.
---
I haven't had the game screw me out of any score points yet by autocompleting them, and I always follow those two rules. It also worked flawlessly for me back when the same thing happened with atom challenges.
---
Yes, it's bullshit and yes they should fix it, but till then there's this.
---
(Bethesda reads this)
---
Beth1: "So they want decorations not to be scrapped..."
---
Beth2: "Ok, let's add actual camp items, like workbenches into scrappable items"
---
Beth1: "why stop there? equipped armer, and even the allyinto spoiled meat!"
---
(beth1+2 high five and snort asbestos)
---
Instigating Lever Stealth build is pretty fun!  Doesn't quite 1-shot everything but pretty close to it.  "Feels" right as far as power level for a high level character.
---
That's good at least! I didn't think they could but my concern was that they were gonna lure creatures to my camp or just straight up attack the exterior.
---
I mean they have ESO new fallout / elder scrolls and another title their working on star something Bethesda isn‚Äôt going anywhere lol ESO Alone probably makes them enough, they should have them help out the 76 team
---
https://youtu.be/rX7wtNOkuHo
---
If you don‚Äôt want to do it. Just don‚Äôt. Nobody is forcing you to do it. Sure you‚Äôll miss out on those points. But you don‚Äôt have to do it. I completely hate and get bored easily of NW. The only challenges I like are deploy your camp 3 times. Or kill creatures. As soon as I do that, I leave the game. 
---
The point of the score system is to try to get people to do certain things (that some people already do on a regular day anyways) and then reward you for those. Every single day I play I level up at least once. Out of the 500+ enemies I‚Äôll kill that day. There are going to be a few legendary enemies here and there. 
---
Like I said. If there‚Äôs a challenge you don‚Äôt want to do. Don‚Äôt do it. You aren‚Äôt being forced. You aren‚Äôt being punished by taking score points away from you. You simply won‚Äôt get score points for that challenge. Just pick a different one. Now if you don‚Äôt like any of the score challenges then that just sucks for you.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs an odd one and I felt the same about the converter too, but after being burned so many times in the past with games I played long term, I‚Äôm just massively pessimistic and quick to blame, so I do TRY to give benefit of the doubt usually, but they make it very hard to do so with stuff like that and this. 
---
The more you look at it the less sense it makes that you could possibly interpret the coin and legendary scrapping complaints the way they apparently did. I hope they make changes and this is just another small step they‚Äôve already said it‚Äôs not coming in 21 which whilst a bit of a pain, will be worth it if they are making proper steps and delaying it for good reason to get it right. 
---
The grind needs to be toned down massively and already sunk cost for higher levels definitely needs to be taken into consideration more. 
---
Don‚Äôt want everything on a plate, far from it, and there should be some level of working towards these things, but from what I am seeing it currently borders on the insane.
---
Yep pretty much, it happens even when fast traveling too. And I almost tell it will do it too
---
then I go well, that's it for today
---
Just so people actually understand what 1500 levels mean in terms of XP:
---
To get to level 1500, you need 179.939.960 XP.  That's right, 179 MILLION, 939 THOUSAND 960 XP. If you start a fresh character, not counting level 1 since that's what you start with. And guess what, you still haven't done 1500 levels because you start at level 1, not 0, so that's another 240.040 XP you need on top of that. Not much when put it in perspective but the amount required to level up in the higher levels is insane. 
---
It's 200 XP to level 2, 160 XP for each level after that. It's widely assumed that the level curve flattens out after level 100 but this is NOT true. That's been changed a while ago and anyone with a high enough level can easily confirm this. It's extremely obvious with the new score system. I, level 424, currently need between 6 and 7 of the 10K challenges to level up. Which is in line with the math, since I need  67.880 to the next level.
---
So, assuming there is no change to the system there is a chance of exactly slim to none that anyone will ever get there within any kind of reasonable time frame.
---
Basically, if the system stays as is, anyone but those who used the XP exploit from way back, are screwed.
---
I would be for that. But there definitely needs to be a way to organize perk cards if thag happens. Like let us favorite them or hide them or something.
---
An apology with comments like
---
"I had assumed it was a negligent discharge, since they seemed so new. If it wasn't, then get fucked little baby nerds, wish I had taken your lead scraps too!"
---
Haha it was a strange brag post about taking down a team of lower levels. However a huge hole regarding team tagging was mentioned. 
---
Before this was mentioned you were asked a few questions which you answered following the same story as the original post. 
---
After it was mentioned the story changed dramatically to reflect how it could of happened now you've been informed that team tagging doesn't exist. 
---
Weak story is weak...
---
So I'm happy they are reworking the ammo converter but reading what they wrote here just infuriated me because of how far they missed the mark on what the player base actually wants. How could they have not known that late game players would not have tons of ammo saved up and want to be able to exchange large quantities. I have really tried to avoid questioning whether or not the devs play their own game, but things like this make it pretty apparent that they do not.
---
I hate NW as well. Can‚Äôt get kills to save my life. Everyone jumps madly in the air the moment they are first shot. They strafe back and forth in an annoying manner as well. I‚Äôm sure they will respond ‚Äúgit good noob‚Äù but I do not play multiplayer death match games ever and I do not really care to. I honestly do not see the allure. To each his own I guess. I do far better hiding. I‚Äôm rank 7 now and I think I have only 1 kill and one downed. It‚Äôs frustrating because I can unload many rounds in someone and they do not die but frequently get one shotted.
---
Are you the one who downvoted? üòÇ
---
Theese dupes really make me want to stop playing this game, like if you get some rare gear it is worthless because of this dupes and bethesda's incompetence.
---
Happened yesterday middle of SBQ and Wendigo Colossus battle, where I‚Äôd expended 2000 .50 cal rounds, 8 Fusion Cores, dozen radaways and 20 Stimpaks. Server disconnected, no rewards. Like you, not even mad. Almost comically amused. There‚Äôs some kind of genius in that I suppose, that we keep coming back to this colossally flawed game that deep down, you know there isn‚Äôt really much there there. Grind grind grind crash, get a nocturnal junkie‚Äôs baseball bat for a reward. Maybe.
---
I'll admit I am paranoid in general, I have severe anxiety disorder which I've dealt with for years now. I do like players visiting my CAMP since I have vendors. I think it was just that they were both stood there doing nothing which gave me a bad vibe.
---
I'm on PC, there's lots of mods for the game on PC and lots of people using them. All cosmetic and user interface stuff, nothing nefarious.
---
I mean it‚Äôs kinda 50/50 because half the reason everyone even veteran players have good weapons is due to the original dupe lol
---
You can always use your junk while it‚Äôs still in stash, never any need to risk losing junk
---
(ammo converter now converts all ammo into raw cloth)
---
(angry player noises)
---
(bethesda giggles)
---
A system like the Score would work too. Gain reputation with the BOS by killing mutants or using PA on a daily basis.
---
That's actually a good idea! I don't see any reason to AFK at someone else's CAMP anyways but I could be missing something.
---
That makes me wish I had a PC.
---
Gargantuas mechanic in a garbage portion of a garbage game. Nothing new here.
---
If your talking about your overall character level I don't think there is I'm not 100% sure though.
---
What‚Äôs your lever action stars? Do you have the secret service armor?
---
Always had crazy recoil. Choices are use it in single shot mode or use vats. Auto non vats has always been borderline unusable.
---
Still baffling how it released in the state that it did. The reworks sound good, but I don't think that they know what late game players want which is sad because anyone actually playing the game should be able to tell.
---
Been in too many of these where it fails at the last minute, and that stings, too. I‚Äôm all for fair play with tagging enemies and legendaries, but I will prioritize the event objectives above hurt feelings. The team win and rewards are more important in the end. If people need to farm XP, might I suggest The Burrows or even better ... taking on all the bots and turrets in a nuke silo and then launching on a farm zone like Fissure Prime, Whitesprings, or Morgantown? That‚Äôs some good XP farming.
---
no
---
(sad train-horn noise)
---
No,I dont think it's so bad. I haven't experienced much crashes on ps4 though (3 in total). Server desyncs however ...that pisses me off. Seriously it is sometimes literally unplayable unless I server hop for like 15 minutes.
---
Since XP is needed particularly if you're on the Legendary Run, level 3 Inspirational is nice. That's usually what I share with my main as he's got high Charisma and I'm usually in a team.
---
I think this is a current glitch with wooden walls only -all other wall types work.
---
Then what are complaining about? If you are unaffected by this issue why complain then? Why do you as an unaffected individual care more about the issue than those genuinely affected? To clarify, you are complaining about people 1 shotting mobs to xp grind when you shoot with ur agl to xp grind? If their intention is not one shot then they are trying to do the same thing you are yet you are telling them to stop doing what they are doing hence double standard. You exclude yourself when you do the exact same thing. Like get a grip on your ego dude lmao. Callin people dumb when you cant even recognize your own bs. Get over yourself
---
Legendary modules if you haven't bought bullion items yet
---
I suggest going for the gauss shotgun if you use a shotgun.
---
For sure, I think I'm just generally bad at games lol. I'm trying to go for a sneaky/snipey VATS build and I've used the nukesdragons website to build a plan but I'm not quite there yet. We finished Wastelanders recently and I'm loving the stealth armour!
---
YEah - I get it, no one said he wasn't good and I suck. 
---
I've played a lot of FPS over the years though lately getting more into WoT style if I play them - I've never been great, but I have been fairly good at them- BF 2142 and WoT I was good at (100% rating on a few tanks in WoT). So - I'm not new to playing against other players - I do have some experience with target acquisition (that also really helps when doing the sneaky bit as well...helps to avoid players when you spot them first...got to the last 4 players by sneaking and hiding in a suit of PA).
---
But the games have always been balanced to a point where you could compete. I don't know if this is something that happens in the newer FPS but there was never a 2 hit and die moment unless you were getting sniped in the head with a heavy weapon...and no one was ever standing around for that next hit. If it really is balanced so that you can hop in and drop someone with 2 shots and hop out again, maybe that's a balance issue as well?
---
ah okay.  I'm really sorry you have to deal with that.. Since youve been dealing with it for years I highly doubt anything I say to you on reddit will help you in your plight but idk.  I have never had anything bad happen to my camp in 1100 hours of being on the map other than friends teasing me by hiding signs in my camp lol.  And even if anything bad does happen, it can all be rebuilt no harm done!  It's just junk after all.  Best of luck out there.
---
Yeah.  It hurts.  5 picks lost.
---
oh ok bless where do they discuss this stuff
---
part of the street team huh?
---
Yeah that's what I thought the public teams were used for. I wondered if I'd annoyed them by not joining in on their adventure lol. I was just doing my own thing with the extra benefits from being in a team.
---
Rebuilding index might help.
---
it says this post was removed for rule 10 and its not a trade post or retired topic. what gives?
---
Sometimes they'll post something here or in the Bethesda forums for patches..."sometimes" but not always.
---
Get in the SBQ's pocket and woo-woo!
---
after its "fixed" a month from now youll hear about it
---
&gt; you mean like bloodied makes everything super easy, right? No matter how you balance the enemies, an overpowered build will make the game child's play. Which is why builds have to be balanced too, but most people in the community are against balancing their overpowered toys...
---
I have to think throwing in some Damage Over Time effects like poison, fire, and rads would have to work over bloodied pretty good - especially if they were environmental and not mob based.
---
No, but you can calculate how many you need. 
---
XPn=160\*(n‚àí1)+200
---
XPn = XP needed for the next level
---
n = your current level
---
This still doesn't tell you where exactly you are but it makes it a lot easier to guess how much longer it takes. ;)
---
I disagree. NW is great now. I'm having a lot of fun.
---
If you have a private world. Just go there. Claim a workshop. And build the 10 things you need. Build it, scrap it. Repeat. 
---
If you‚Äôre in a public server. And you don‚Äôt want to risk getting in a fight with people. Go to your camp. Build AWAY from your structure. There‚Äôs always room somewhere, not like you‚Äôre using 100% of the build area build it. Scrap it. Repeat.
---
does the legendary pool have a waterslide?
---
dude where does your ego come from? You are telling people to not do something everyone else there is to do, including you. Why should they care about the needs of other irrelevant players over their especially when its people like you?
---
Selfish's human true natural, other than that all hypocrite huh? Yes, I m hypocrite just like those who switched to less powerful weapon to avoid instant killing event bosses, the one rush like there is no tomorrow and one shot everything is the King.
---
Strealth Armour, swap a few perks and go commando, grab a fixer or handmade and you should be able to do any event .. just stay in sneak!
---
Welcome aboard on the dupe train and the end of this game economy!!!!! Chooo choooo
---
That's true haha. Thanks for that, it actually puts things into perspective. After years of playing Minecraft, where someone nuking your house is basically the end of the world, I guess I forgot that you can just easily repair it in this game.
---
Well Murgle seems to have a heart condition and randomly dies fairly often.. On average I'd say I have 1.5 cats :P
---
Is there a good way to finish the encounter? I ended up befriending the &gt;!cannibals!&lt; and following them down to the basement. Not sure if it was a bug. I ate some meat and went on my way.
---
Yes, so many events with items that can be destroyed but are required to make the event a success getting broken and never repaired, can be frustrating when there's nobody repairing things. üòë
---
Gators walk on hind legs and the raiders use less chems.  Everything else stays the same.
---
have to imagine they are going to wire in perk coins and card packs are regular rewards into seasons/events/quests to make this doable, it seems fine as a long long long long long term goal, but we need to be able to reset/respec them if it takes that long.
---
ooooooh, now i can make a high dive
---
yeah that‚Äòs how it seems to go down there lately.
---
I do wish the score challenges could get more creative. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how.
---
No you are a hypocrite because you tell people to not do something you are trying to partake in not because of the bullshit scenario of morality you created.
---
Thx mate
---
How can the economy get ruined if it already was
---
Fantastic change, now let‚Äôs see if we can get them to work on the perk coin system
---
Same here, only did a single NW challenge and unlocked the UFO or the rank after it last night.
---
I'm thinking about dropping a general guide to xp boosting, legitimate boost only ofcourse. Been testing and checking every thing I can over the last week. The 100 score repeatable might end up over the course of 10 weeks to be what gets you the last few you need. Then save the atoms you gain throughout the season for the last few you dont ge sibce you can buy them for 150 atoms starting next week.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
How do they do that?
---
I would do the NW stuff but I'm not going to uninstall my mods to do so.
---
I understand why mods are not allowed in NW but it's still onerous to have to remove them just to complete a challenge.
---
Whenever you see something cool, nice and fancy. It‚Äôs usually always an item to purchase from the Atom shop. Not so much a plan in the game. It was a thanksgiving display case. It came with a bundle originally, although you could‚Äôve bought it by itself too. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs come back at all, so unless it happens soon, you might just have to wait until thanksgiving again.
---
Yeah ik. I had it on me to transfer
---
Yeah, Mr Todd forces you to do this personally, ofc. Maybe just ignore them and dont whine? Im lvl 26 and just doing faction dailys with scrip cap and this is just 2nd week
---
 "People are jerks for completing the event objective (protecting the ASAM)? "  
---
I think u cre8 a pretty nice new objective for the Line in the Sand ald
---
It just goes to show that the devs don‚Äôt play the games and when they want to rank their legendary perk card up they just spawn the coins they want thru console commands and then say that looks good to me without thinking about how long it will really take
---
I like how this guy lives in his own bubble lmfao
---
If this was after a Queen fight the Flux you had on you would have been deleted on death anyways.
---
I don‚Äôt see how duping hurts anyone who isn‚Äôt buying shit for real money.
---
So the ugly terminal stays with the converter? I still don't see why they don't make it like scrapping legendaries. e) Scrap ammo, r) buy ammo. There two whole screens and no ugly terminal needed.
---
And can we get the mouth harp as well?
---
That's a pretty good idea actually lol
---
Hmm y'know i just realized how much I miss sneaking grenades into pockets.
---
Sweet! Thanks for letting me know. I was pretty sure that was going to be the case and as others have pointed out it seems my Cat is making use of the Animation Objects placed around the for cats.
---
But you never know with Bethesda, always worth a shot!
---
Yes, but anything would be better than hunt down a deserting raider or finding that item Ward lost again.
---
Team tagging doesn't even matter in this scenario since they all engaged in PVP with me. I answer questions following the same story as the original post because that's what happened. I had assumed that the first shot was an accident. If it was not, then I do not feel sorry at all for killing them. Even a new player should at least understand what shooting at another player means.
---
Glad it will help üëç
---
Didnt say the economy was good in the first place. But now everything going down the drain. Everypiece that had value now not worth a penny.
---
If Bethesda can‚Äôt get simple shit right with the building mechanics, how in the world would they achieve a massive moving structure?
---
*fuck* softly
---
I was going to say the same thing but decided this wasn‚Äôt a fight I cared to enter by saying something g lol
---
Or opening the world map and closing it works.
---
I'm a glutton for punishment.
---
Nah man, bethesda thinks that content is making endless grinds that will take years. They want players to stick around but dont want to keep adding relevant content. So they are introducing this ridiculous grind thinking people will just grind for years. We can see this patern with all the bullshit daily caps already.
---
Oh I so agree
---
Nah I had everything on me to transfer
---
Ohhhh ok thanks!
---
&gt; This event has the player character or [party](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Party) fight against hordes of [Scorched](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorched) and two [scorchbeasts](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorchbeast) while defending the sonic generator. The item reward for completion contains random supplies, weapons and/or armor pieces. 
---
&gt;Clear the initial Scorched from the area and repair the sonic generator and the [automated surface to air missile](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Automated_surface_to_air_missile) (ASAM). When ready, access the terminal and initiate the pre-combat check. Defend the sonic generator and if it is destroyed, repair it. Focus on defeating the Scorched and allow the ASAM to take care of the scorchbeasts. The only few ways to fail this event is to let the event timer run out, or to let the timer to repair the generator run out. While not a quest requirement, repair of the ASAM may also be required as it will be difficult to kill the scorchbeasts if it is damaged and goes offline.  
---
&gt;If the player character lets an ASAM defeat a scorchbeast without personally damaging it, they will not be able to loot the carcass. They will receive experience points for the event but will not receive XP for the kill (which are higher than the points for the event). The kill will also not count toward other quests like [Officer on Deck](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Officer_on_Deck). However, the corpse may still be looted for [scorchbeast meat](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorchbeast_meat) if the player character has the [Butcher's Bounty](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Butcher%27s_Bounty) perk card equipped.
---
the sonic generator is attached to the ASAM. You turning it into an XP farm is your own invention and not the goal of the event.  
---
You haven't even stated what the event goal is, just keep telling people they are doing it wrong for not glitching it the way you want to.
---
You also haven't countered any of the arguments from anyone about how you are basically exploiting and that no one should have sympathy for exploiters
---
I'll give you credit for sticking to whatever narrative you have though.
---
Also never had any crashes on PC
---
I fucking hate Nuclear Winter. If i want to play pvp battle royalle/pvp shooter i have way way better games to do so.
---
People glitching to get to lv 100 does nothing to harm other players tbh
---
Personally I absolutely hate the idea of one wasteland. One of the things I loved was starting out and if I explored too far then I'd get beaten to a bloody paste and that sense of pride and accomplishment when I finally was able to explore the entire map without being instantly killed. Plus the community of being helped by a higher level and then passing it on to help a lower level and I've been managed to get more friends playing with wastelanders and I was glad they felt that same pride of going from needing help to them helping me just as much as I help them. With one wasteland and damage scaling it means all the work into levelling up so you can explore the map is gone and one the best challenges and enjoyment of the game is gone. No reason to do multiple play throughs because gone is the ability to work your way up to areas. I love this game but the choices made by the managing team really frustrate
---
The devs, project managers, etc don't play the game (and they have no QA).
---
The issue is that the account doing the duping is a throw away account. Most of the duping ends up in IRL sites for real cash. The banned accounts are just the cost of business for these sites. It also doesn‚Äôt help that the major you tubers for fo76 all advertise these sites and thus promote increased duping.
---
Unfortunately that only helps pc players. They need to think of consoles also when they do things. We get very few QoL 3rd party fixes on console and it sucks. Or they should just allow QoL mods on console and be done with it.
---
You must not be praying to Todd Howard enough.
---
Yeah probably. Good luck! Don‚Äôt overpay.
---
Additionally if you start placing floors on any level of the stairs you will not be able to remove them. Make sure you know where you want the floors to be.
---
Agree wholeheartedly.  I do not appreciate being strong armed into PVP to gain perks, either 
---
But...I still have not ever set foot into NW, nor will I likely ever, and I have found that not doing these NW PVP tasks does not really impact my ability to make any meaningful headway on the Legendary Run board.
---
I just don't worry about the NW tasks.
---
I was on an event team yesterday and had just finished fighting the SBQ in the radiation area.  I wasn't paying attention to my radiation level and died when a Mirelurk King got me.  I tried to get help but nobody came to my rescue.  As I waited there standing next to me was one of my "teammates," he waited for me to respawn and took all of my junk to include the flux of course.  Apparently we are a team in name only.
---
get the TSE version and one shot has you pointing straight up
---
It's not a crash, a super mutant snuck up and clubbed you upside the head. The game is just THAT immersive.
---
Same random event locations. This particular one showed up at crashed vertibird spot on the northeast corner of the map. I was actually after a Megasloth or Deathclaw at the time since my previous sloth went missing. Decided since I had nothing to lose at that point, why not? lol
---
True Just sucks this stuff happens to every mmo with no real way to stop it
---
That was strangely arousing. I don‚Äôt know if I need help but I need to think about some things now.
---
Come again?
---
He keeps saying that defending the sonic generator/ASAM is not the event goal but doesn't say what the event goal is
---
He's trying to argue XP farming is the purpose of all events. 
---
I'm sorry, I'd much rather walk away from events with the rewards it provides - be it the chance for the plan for the radiation barrel, the arktos backpack plan, the treasury notes, or whatever else may be the drops from the event.
---
Indeed.
---
I share Inspirational because I want XP.
---
Maybe something that isn't hot garb, too?
---
45 def getting slower to hit them levels
---
Loved how demon posted a duping vid this morning about this dupe and the first thing on the vid was an advert for a site that is probably using the dupe. ‚ÄúUse my code so that I can make real cash off of duping too‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt plan to and I have never used any of these exploits but if they disable vendors for longer than about an hour to hotfix the problem I doubt I would play again. Tired of legit players getting the shaft in this game.
---
if it gives a reason to go back to 3/6 of the current zones im all for it
---
I totally agree with you that PA has its pros and cons and PA build is totally viable for some. And yes, I know that bloodied builds are OP. I only play bloodied chars, 'cause I like to gain as much xp as fast as possible and killing things efficiently. But there are lots of stuff that work in synergy that makes these builds OP, while those synergies are almost completely non-existent for non-bloodied builds. I personally think that devs need to alter balance of other builds, complementing them with rebalanced regular perks  to make them on par with bloodied one.
---
Also, I don't really think Beth is designing anything around people of higher levels, otherwise we'd already have tons of endgame content with scalable difficulty. I doubt they really know what current meta is. But yeah, we will see what they came up with in the future with their rebalancing update.
---
Do you ever understand what **AT LEAST**  means? With the buff u stated it could go much higher. OH so all the people participate in the glitched event are the cheaters, nice words.   
---
and I never asked for ur sympathy dude, who u think u r?
---
Sad day. Even if they aren‚Äôt on your team, taking people‚Äôs junk when they die is just lame.
---
Ouch. :(
---
Anyone know how long this event/discount Will last? Thanks ;)
---
They forgot one thing... the new dupe at station vendors! Just in time for the new players!
---
Haha, sounds reliable üòÇ
---
Why is this getting downvoted? Is it a commonly asked question or something?
---
(bethesda adds bagpipes)
---
A time requirement wasn‚Äôt that bad to me honestly many games have enrage mechanics for bosses so you can‚Äôt just sit there all day and eventually finish, there should be some skill requirement to finish the highest setting
---
Ok so bug prediction, the converter rework scraps ALL your ammo into points at once
---
Thank GOD it's not just me.
---
But at the same time... oh god, it's not just me.
---
I'm not actually bothered about overpaying. I've got so much stuff sitting there that's worth a lot of caps. It's not like it's getting used.
---
Trading for ebay guns.  Talk all u want.  U still got an ebay gun.
---
Just means I'll have to toss more legendary garbage on the ground in order to move.
---
(drops caps in wishing well)
---
"You have contracted dysentery!"
---
I wouldn‚Äôt post his name but it just gets annoying with these dupes because the game is really good this just brings negative attention to it you know? I just don‚Äôt get the people like praising him for it, I remember when unyielding sentinel was so over powered people would buy it on eBay etc for thousands and when they nerfed it to 75% of the time everyone panicked and bashed Bethesda
---
The ghillie suit is amazingly good for hiding you in any kinda bush
---
What weapons/build are you aiming for long term? What level are you? Are you planning on doing the bullion items? What is your character spec‚Äôd for in your cards?
---
Last I heard it was just Pete Hines and that was almost a year ago
---
My game crashes too rarely for that
---
they better not punishing me playing too much.... I don't want my lv500 to be weaker than newly made lv200.
---
Nah it doesn‚Äôt, as far I know it‚Äôs still really hard to come across one in the game
---
So you are one of the people I shoot that doesn‚Äôt drop a bag.
---
I agree that it is horrible but you can spam enter buttons to make it go faster most of the time. I personally would not mind it taking time but do not think we should have to sit there spamming buttons to do it. It should just have storage on 2 ends, 1 for input where you put all the junk ammo, 1 for output, and on the side in the center it should have a console. You would put the desired ammo in the console and it should just take from the input till it has enough to put some of the selected ammo in the output. I do not mind that it is not an equal exchange since I figured there would be some loss but to have both that and the annoyance that is the UI it is just too much.
---
You only need to wait 20 hrs, but yeah I get what you mean. You have FO1st, just out all your extra stuff on a mule. You are safe when doing it in your private server.
---
so a wishing well that copies food buffs that costs caps?
---
I try switching to a different Fallout game every time one crashes. It happens more often than you'd think.
---
Why so salty lmfaooo
---
The Ammo one sounds nice. 50% more ammo makes being a heavy much more tolerable.
---
Well that and the auto completing challenges that award no SCORE.
---
Oh and the fact that adrenal reaction is broken.
---
Oh and smiley not resetting properly.
---
Oh and people freezing on the respawn screen when dying.
---
problem is once you hit a certain level you just don't really need caps. And 100 caps is literally nothing. Even if it was 1000 i think people would pay it.
---
To this day I‚Äôm awed every time I do Encryptid and it didn‚Äôt crash like the game is clearly melting but it doesn‚Äôt crash but we opening a door will causes the game to explode
---
Yes keep it up, I'd like to watch u guys jumping around to try to defend selfish act, oh if u want to one shot everything in events go to private server, nobody will complain, in there u can even one shot SBQ
---
I pick up tons of shotgun rounds, railway rifle ammo, 45 etc at line in the sand ... every day just one event and it takes way to long to convert just what I get there why can‚Äôt it just work like a stash or vending machine ? I got this I want this bam done 2-3 clicks tops üòê
---
no clue, im not the type that votes on forums
---
Yeah, seeing the math like this kinda points out how insane it is. The time frame should be on the order of like a month or so to max out a perk or two, not what seems like forever. Also, if they're worried about players completing the "grind" too early (ha ha ha), they should have added a LOT more legendary perks to chase.
---
If we want to zero in on something, it shouldn't take long, but if we want to build up a collection, that's the long journey to take part in. More options, not more steps to get to a few options.
---
He‚Äôs got 120,000 subscribers. The second he posts something it‚Äôs as public knowledge as it will get.
---
Did you ever wonder why we got a new expansion where everything new is character locked?
---
This is how duping affects you. It changes gameplay development.
---
2025hrs in, I don‚Äôt even know what you all are talking about anymore. Feels like it‚Äôs just a feature at this point, a feature that definitely just works!
---
I have only ever used it when I made a carnival type cape, and I had it at the ticket booth connected to a switch and generator, for purely cosmetic reasons; Haven‚Äôt found a practical application of it yet!
---
If it ends up being as tedious as it sounds, I‚Äôm not going to even touch that system. I barely hit level 100 after close to 300 hours in game. I cannot imagine leaving up 100-200+ more times to fully utilize a legendary perk, especially when only 2-3 seem useful (to me at least).
---
Say the part about people honestly sucking at this game a little louder
---
I know I just don‚Äôt like giving him any potential new people lol I just want this damn game to be good! Lol I think they have made vast improvements though and am very excited for the brotherhood
---
I'm new to vendoring in fallout, only set up my first one after the last fix a couple months back. 
---
I sell cheap. But I only sell items that I'd buy and only at a price that I'd pay. I'm finding I have to re stock practically every day. My stash has gone from full down to about 500 lbs.
---
I think location plays a big part too though. I'm sat right next to Watoga Station.
---
I like the comfort and security of the forest. The worst I have to deal with is level 5 super mutants trying to take out my generator. I feel, through my gameplay, I have earned the right for some areas to be easier than others.
---
Ur a high end peasant.  Nothing more nothing less.
---
Who wants enemies to explode? Like that‚Äôs the most annoying thing about legendary robots. You gotta look for the loot after the kill lol
---
Absolutely, as thecookiemonster pointed out earlier, the Tamed Cat is using the objects.
---
I like this guy, hes pretty interesting. I'd like it more if he replied faster tho. I really wanna see someones reply not be met with you're a low intelligence wastelander. However I'd also like to point out that dumb people always think their the smartest js. This guy is textbook egomaniac and its honestly great. I dont seem him as a capable person but its definately fascinating
---
Heart of the Swamp.
---
It crashes nearly every time. 
---
I just laugh at myself for being dumb enoguh to join the event.
---
lmao
---
50
---
Bethesda nailed grinding for something important with the Possum Badges. It forces you to play aspects of the game you otherwise would not have. This is just abysmal. Why do they keep thinking this is okay? If they want people to grind to the point their level is in the thousands they should just implement a legendary skill system like ESO. Each level up after 50 gives you one skill point you can allocate to a number of legendary skills. Skills such as Flame Resistance, Team Healing, and Weapon Damage. This way each level up you feel somewhat rewarded and you don‚Äôt feel like you have to level up 300 times to get one perk.
---
There are already players over 1000 and XP is now MUCH easier to get.  For this system to have any life to it, it has to be something like this.
---
I mean, do you play any other games?  There are lots of systems with hundreds if not thousands of hours required.
---
You're not entitled to reach max rank of anything.
---
You should take this as good news as it seems Bethesda wants the game to last beyond the end of the year.
---
Just saying people literally expect SEVERAL god rolls or legacy for this outfit. It‚Äôs pretty ridiculous especially now that it‚Äôs being duped.
---
I swapped OUT of PA on my Int-PA focused main, to do a stealth bloodied build, simply for exp, and I'm miserably grinding (just hit 250 last night). I hate that the only way to level effectively is with bloodied/unyielding. But I just can't say no to that int!
---
this is just ignorant.
---
substitute the word game for life, tbh
---
It can go higher, but it's going to be comparable to just farming XP with less down time and less worry.  
---
And yes, if people are participating in the event, they are cheating.  Taking advantage of an exploit in the game is the literal definition of cheating.  I've cheated in the game at times too. I've done the glitched event.  I have FO1st so I can do it solo or with my friends all I want, which is why I'm saying it's not any more effective than trying to simply farm the experience. it wasn't hard to calculate the XP per hour with the same perks/buffs and then take into consideration things like downtime, loading, and travel time.  
---
If you really want to exploit XP fast go do glass caverns. It's endless, faster, and doesn't even require 1st, and doesn't put the server into a weird state if bugs out when trying to spawn. 
---
And **YOU** asked for sympathy.  Your entire post is "Please stop being mean to me so I can get expoit XP too"
---
whoever designed this coin perk system, they don't play this game for long, not designed by a gamer.
---
A buff that would stack along WITH food buffs.
---
This sounds like they are gearing up so you will be able to purchase Perk Coins from the Atom shop....
---
Yeah this, you're just reading it wrong.
---
Erm they did that so you couldn‚Äôt grind the rep on one character and just give your alts and or friends the guns. Meaning they wanted you to play more and for longer to also increase the chances of you buying atoms and making them money. Duper‚Äôs were not hurt as all they had to do is dupe the legendary modules to attain the god rolled items.
---
Doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, content should be locked to players who unlock it. A random shouldn‚Äôt have any of the gold bought guns just because they play. I‚Äôm okay with those being untradeable as well.
---
That's a good point, it does have the appearance of a like those ticket wheel/take a ticket things. (I don't know what you call them)
---
LOL ... you almost had me.
---
I just want to delete my unused cards. That's literally ALL I WANT!!!
---
Not salty.  Just calling u out.  The salty comment is hilarious.  That‚Äôs always to goto comment when someone got nothing else to say.
---
It‚Äôs the community fault we made them this way lol
---
I just dont understand what that had to do with anything in the discussion unless I am missing something?
---
many other are experiencing this too, including myself, and its fucking bullshit.
---
they "acknowledged" the bugs, but haven't said shit about what they are going to do to make up for it. it's completely fucked if those of us affected have to grind harder because of a fuck up on their end - especially considering they are accepting *cash* to rank up.
---
this is a big deal and people aren't being vocal enough about it.
---
I wasn‚Äôt the one you were talking to, you just sound very salty from reading the thread.
---
My wife has tried to collect these in game, but after the third or fourth time of them getting scrapped for whatever reason, she has given up.
---
I would get these for her, but I'm afraid Bethesda might figure out a way to make these real ones scrap themselves as well.
---
&gt; People get really used to the fact that there isn't a single enemy in this game that uses anything actually resembling combat tactics and it is hard for them to adjust to a really real person   
---
Not to say the AI in the game are overly special or anything but a little defense some enemy types do actually take cover and others, wolves for instances, do legitimately try to encircle you much as a pack of wolves would irl. Tbh I have noted that a lot of the enemy types have their own specific AI for combat associated with what they are.
---
What a great introduction to the game this will be to the gamepass users. They will immediately be able to see how slow/passive Bethesda are when it comes to fixing shit like this.
---
yah but nobody complains if you dont care either lmfao. You consistenlty try to tell people to do things the way you want and still do not see why everyone thinks youre a massive boso. At this point I am not even defending the playstyle, I just want you to know that you are a hypocrite and are so blinded by your ego that you dont even recognize how stupid your continuum of thought is. Best of luck to you in your endeavors in life. I am sure you will face many problems
---
I just find it funny when people are in an ivory tower built on top of a pile of shit. 
---
Granted I know I write long winded responses sometime, but for him to ignore 95% of what I wrote and only pinpoint one particular thing to latch onto just shows he doesn't even know how to respond to the rest of it anyways.
---
yeah, but there is no water, so you are grinding your ass off to the end. it is quite the bloody mess
---
auto-completing challenges giving no SCORE
---
Eh duped weapons will be level 45/50 lol and honestly game pass adding players may make them force their hand on these issues
---
Leader Of The Pack. Got my 3 for the week in one go and it took about 5 bullets from my TSE combat rifle.
---
They did it to combat RMT with duped items and RMT in general.  You are wrong.  The vast majority of dupers dont dupe for personal use.  They dupe to sell on gameflip and make real money.
---
Been playing since launch. I get smacked and enjoy the game.. at like 400 hours
---
Limb damage is bugged so you will put up crazy damage numbers with it. 100% do it.
---
Meanwhile in Cyberpunk apparently you can customize your spicy bits
---
it is going to be the assault-tron head all over again
---
then that would make everyone afk what
---
I think it was probably more like they were doing their dailies and didn't GAF but I like your version better
---
Is this for pc or is it a console probelm aswell?
---
You‚Äôre willing pay 50$ for that?
---
probably a bug, previously they always were the hammer and free to travel to if you owned
---
You're late! Im already half-way drunk! -Becket (x50)
---
At the very least, it would be nice to have some kind of console in our CAMP were we can load a holotape, and anyone who comes can access it (but not take it). Then you can load any holotape games you have. Not the same as a full arcade, but would be a step towards it.
---
Ammo convertor...thank fuck, good work big B :-)
---
No mention of the many totally broken perk cards though :-(
---
Oh I can understand u want to rush like there r no tomorrow, then go to private server to one shot everything, no one will complain, but when u play in public at least u can try to being little nice when there are other people around  
---
Like I stated in the beginning, I can't stop what u want to do, but I guess that with ur standard u won't understand the difference between doing things right and doing right things  
---
Make some friend in-game and play together dudes, it feels different
---
I need the ghillie for scout armour long road ahead for me
---
Yup, kinda used it to by now...
---
Yeah, me too. It‚Äôs a legendary weapon though so you would have to kill the Grafton Monster, Scorchbeast, or just get lucky when looting a container.
---
I'm telling you, the M79 grande launcher  (unspeced) is great for line in the Sand. It simply tags them, I tag and let others kill em.
---
Pop some nukashine and look for the mothman for your answers
---
Thats the improvement for the ammo converter? It needs to be a container. Everybody who has tried this thing for a second has to understand that.
---
Legendary perk card to solve this issue... but is it worth it, I'm not sure
---
I'm super happy with it, especially now that we need XP for the legendary race and future legendary perks. That means good XP everywhere. No more low lvl mobs in high lvl areas.
---
This kind of shenanigans is why I run out into the open field, out of range of the one gun army tent spam, and try to get the Queen's aggro with an LMG.  Usually she is so desperate for a clear target to land next to that she lands right on top of me and I can try to lead her back to the group while she's down.
---
Wish people would realize that staggering her in the air and confusing her AI by sitting on floating tents and fences just makes the fight a wasteful slog.
---
Furthermore, if she doesn't land, she doesn't spawn her entourage. So much xp in those adds.
---
My reaction has become, ‚Äú [turns off PS4]that‚Äôs enough FO76 for today‚Äù.
---
Well it‚Äôs also really easy to sneak around. That said there‚Äôs no way I try it.
---
I have been saying this since BEFORE Wastelanders..
---
PTS Should be opened for everyone without single NDA to discuss openly with players ..
---
This is how to make your the game better 
---
More people testing more feedback comes 
---
By the way i love this thread about LPS Great Job OPüëç
---
It's a bug.
---
If you swap servers or your camp can't be placed and it searches for a new server.... The workshops bug out.
---
Close the game and reopen in full and they work until you swap again.
---
Glad to see they're improving the ammo converter but it still seems they completely missed the point.  The *terminal itself* is what's slowing us down.  Just letting us scrap ammo would be infinitely better.
---
yes it's good in this event
---
Lol.  How is me calling out dude for eBay gun salty?
---
Did they ever do anything about the apparently crappy ui on pc?
---
Bad grammar I love the fact we just steal duper‚Äôs shiz that they worked hard for
---
Thats exactly why. That item need to be tracked ans synced by everyone. It alot of strain. The servers lag alot even when random stuff gets exploded around
---
&gt;Fewer Button Presses: Buying and selling is being incorporated directly into the terminal page for each ammo type, which means there will be one less screen for you to click through when exchanging your ammo
---
so now it is 5 menu screens that back you out after one use instead of 6! TALK ABOUT IMPROVEMENT!
---
My understanding is the Legendary specials allow you to have perk points to use while freeing up perk points to use elsewhere. 
---
So I have 15 Strength pre Legendary perk. 
---
I can now remove 5 points and move them elsewhere and equip my Legendary strength card then reequip my 15 Strength cards. 
---
Now I have 5 specials to place elsewhere while still having my original Strength cards before all the changes.
---
And yet strangely that's *still* more useful than ammo I don't ever use.
---
Omg thank you so much!
---
There is your double edged sword. You can let the duping go on for a few days to destroy RMT or keep the RMT in power.
---
Maybe make it to where enemy‚Äôs drops are now in a paper bag with some kind of indicator to show where it is but for things like scorchbeast and Queens maybe keep it the same with a setting to have it auto loot
---
yeah their big change was to make it so you didn't have to scrap gold cards, which in turn makes everything much more expensive.... good change. Showing you understand your players and game once again....
---
I will say, the perks are getting better. Far from perfect, but better. But the cost is asinine.
---
It was supposed to a few mins ago, but it  hasn't.
---
While we're at it removing challenges to kill legendaries and NW dailies, they should remove dailies all together. It is unfair to those who don't want to be forced to play everyday. For some the weekly challenges are hard enough, adding in dailies are just way too much.
---
If you were doing a transfer, what we you doing putting yourself in a situation where you could die?
---
I don't play the game
---
I do not want to be force into doing something I do not want to do.
---
As much as other people may enjoy playing the game, I simply feel that because I do not like doing it, S.C.O.R.E. should not be awarded because it is PUNISHING me for not doing shomething I don't enjoy.
---
It sucks that I am forced to play the game I don't enjoy playing just to reach the end of the board
---
I‚Äôd wish for a ceiling in my house, it‚Äôs awful that we can create these great homes with different wallpapers and floors but still have that ugly unfinished ceiling
---
I was afk at my camp and some radtoads killed me lol
---
They did award XP, Mission 1 gave you 14000~ XP total for completing it (at least on Expert, I don't recall if this is lower on the lower difficulties). The mobs gave around 3 XP each, but completing a 'phase' of the Mission gave you a big dump of XP each time.
---
I was playing bloodied before, but respecced to have 14 int in my bloodied heavy gunner build for seasons. Now after all buffs I get about 650 xp from a super mutant and 2250 from a sentrybot. It's like freakin double-xp weekend forever. Can't wait to start using lunchboxes when the real double-xp weekend kicks in :D
---
The adrenal reaction mutation works for me... but the adrelaline perk card is broken.
---
That's all we can get on console!
---
I gave NW a *real* shot for the first time yesterday.  (Last week I popped in for all of 30 seconds to do 3 hasty camp deployments and immediately quit.)  I had 180 unopened perk packs to redeem.   It took me several sessions of hiding in the bushes to even open them all and,  aside from the Overseer's Chair, I cannot tell you what any of them were and I had no time to even bother exploring the perk card load out possibilities.  I wouldn't mind having the option to delay the start until I've decided I was ready to go.
---
Don't think such abuse would be allowed, it can work inside the C.A.M.P budget.
---
Tried 4 pieces of light combat + 1 piece of light leather. Doesnt work.
---
I'd just be more blunt, because it clearly falls on deaf ears at Bethesda: the Perk Coin system is a stupid idea.  Full stop.
---
You might say "That's not helpful."  But they don't seem to give much of a damn about constructive feedback and passionately worded essays.
---
He‚Äôs clearly trolling regardless if he does it or not, nothing you say to him will change what he does it just looks like you‚Äôre bitter you don‚Äôt have strong guns or you don‚Äôt have a legacy
---
That Ammo Converter is a 5 minutes fix that we didn't ask for. We asked for a rework.
---
And also. If I want to put eyeliner on my male character. *You should just let me do that.*
---
Farming flux makes it far less efficient than the other weapons.  My time is the most valuable part of that equation.
---
You‚Äôre even the person who down votes every comment, come on dude you‚Äôre a salt pile get it together
---
I run from every legendary enemies I find or they find me. I hope they take them out of the game! So op! They regenerate health!?
---
‚ÄúDear god, save us all!‚Äù
---
No this is a terrible idea. Horrible. Just out right paying for buffs is more like paying to win than anything you might find in the Atomic Shop that people complain about.
---
I just tried to run through this quest on XB1 and had the missing key swipe bug.
---
Glad you liked our stuff! We wrapped up beginning of June. Info tweet here: https://twitter.com/SleepisforT/status/1268850630824779778?s=19
---
About what happened, a lot of us are still on Twitter and playing. A couple of our members had to stop tho because life/world/2020, so we decided to cease operations.
---
Some of us have just started a new channel The United Wastelanders Network doing Camps on Thursdays but different &amp; other shows &amp; sketches. No HOA tho, RIP. ‚ö∞Ô∏è
---
 http://www.twitch.tv/unitedwastelandersnetwork?sr=a
---
My mistake that's what I meant. Corrected, thanks.
---
Allowing a UI in main menu to setup NW cards prior to joining the server and being on the clock would fix this...good mention
---
Try logging out &amp; logging back in
---
nah bro, i get it, ITS NOT A PROBLEM IF YOU IDENTIFY YOUR HYPOCRISY AND ACKOWLEDGE BIAS. Its just an opinion but this guy is trying to impose his opinion onto others by telling us to change how we play
---
Ah, ok. Thanks!
---
I did and it worked thank you
---
It's *very* necessary for 76 imo. The game currently lacks good XP spots (even worse when low lvl players hang out in high lvl areas and "contaminate" mobs). This new feature is a decent fix for this problem.
---
SBQ with a event team I joined.  First time I ever tried to kill it. Had about am 1/8th of health left.  Probably wasted almost all my ammo.  Got some cool photos.  Then ended up at the home screen. Just turned my console off at that point lol
---
I don't like to talk about my flair.
---
Another bonus for public teams I've noticed regarding this problem.
---
When I'm in a public team and I choose to quit out I have two options. Menu and Desktop. When I choose Menu I get a prompt saying that I'll leave the team if I leave. However when I choose Desktop I don;t get this prompt and if I reopen the client I'm still part of the group. (I.E. Join Party instead of Join World) I can still get back onto that world I was just on. I get the same result if the game crashes, so far I've always been able to get back onto the same world provided I'm in a team. 
---
Although I have experimented with doing this repeatedly in a short time for possible item transfers but after a couple times it drops the party I've found.
---
Is the Purveyor sale live it‚Äôs not showing it‚Äôs 12:08 ET time
---
glad to hear i'm getting the full cinematic experience
---
I think it‚Äôs like a joke on their behalf. They are loud on purpose to mock you for having automated services.
---
Thank you -))
---
Yeah, they needed to open public test servers to everyone long ago, I think we might've ended up with completely different game right now.
---
I like arguing but if im wrong im wrong yk. I honestly just want perks to work lmao
---
Just a guess, but I'm willing to bet servers in general are more unstable than usual rn with everyone scrambling to take advantage of the new dupe glitch
---
Rank 32, played each day about 2 hours, getting all dailies except NW ones. I had to do 1 yesterday to get the weekly though.
---
I've hit about 100 repeatable XP scores to make up the difference according to my spreadsheet. Easily obtainable if you build for XP in a guide I wrote. Was received well
---
Na. Just at work with no power so I‚Äôm bored and I‚Äôll play along.
---
If you're on level 27 or higher..... You're NOT behind.
---
Good that the Ammo converter will be usable now. Call it whining, but that shows that they're willing to listen to the community if the roar is loud enough.
---
Having said that, I still don't know why we can't just enter the amount of ammo we want to convert and instead have preset values.
---
Incase you need some other locations, I always find her wandering by the water near Hunters Ridge. I use that route to collect mass plants and 9/10 times ill run into her.
---
I don‚Äôt know if I love it but I feel it‚Äôs a net positive to actually right the economy when it gets too extreme in one direction.. for a good while now the only way you get a good legacy or top tier weapon is by already having one to trade..
---
I I feel to some extent the people that hate it most are the people who are in the controlling section of the economy.. 
---
And if you don‚Äôt like what I‚Äôm saying and you hate dupes then go throw all your legacies in a fissure because over 99% of all of them have been part of this process...
---
The conclusion is, I want to one shot everything so it can end early and I can go to next stop, anyone complaint about this is hypocrite because they are not concern my feeling.  
---
I should take down the photo that literally everyone there thumbs down to the AGL spammer so u ppl can understand the reality. Thank you for your blessing, my life is easy enough for me, the only problem I face is there are too much PITA think that the community behaves lousy like them
---
Still no word on what's happening with the auto complete of the daily score challenges ü§î
---
Same, back when I still played. Trying to reboot and push through just compounded the frustration.
---
Damn you're crushing me! only rank 32 and I play all the spare time i can muster outside family and work.
---
I mean lots of cheaters are at that level so it's all good /s.
---
I logged out and back in and that fixed it
---
Which perks are you referring too?
---
^ This
---
Appreciate it, Thanks.
---
I have a zealots mini gun with faster fire rate that I made prime. With the accelerated barrel it shreds despite not being one of the "magic" broken weapons.
---
So incredibly frustrating and discouraging
---
all pc play together.
---
they'll never cross platform because PC players would shit on console in Nuclear Winter, 60 fps + mouse
---
I'll check when I get back thank you all for info love this community ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I have moments where I kill a legendary and just see the menu pop-up and... Blue screen. I could careless now at 345 but at level 25 that sh&amp;t hurt.
---
What ever rational you have to justify being a salt pile works for me
---
I got the Jukebox turned on too.
---
I ran my game off of the Xbox and then off of the external and it didn‚Äôt change. It still crashes on me 1-2 times a day! Last night was about 3-4 times
---
I've been playing since December of 18 and all the stuff is grindy.   I did max out reputation with box factions and bought all the plans I want/need.
---
They need to focus on new events and boss fights.
---
Tired of running Tea Time for the thousandth time......
---
Good post. Upvoted!!
---
I would love a new banjo riff.. üëçüèº
---
My game barely crashes
---
I thought strange in numbers *did* stack?
---
Why? Now it's still fun.  If they release it in Sept, I'll quit then.  My fo1st is up in November anyways.  So if they do follow through, I won't lose much.
---
They should have stuck with their original plan. When they first mentioned the legendary perk system it was every 50 levels you could ‚Äúobtain‚Äù a new legendary perk card.
---
Yup, prevents me from getting salty. If anything I have learned over the years, is that playing any game while your triggered, you will just do worst. Specially if its something like darksouls.
---
I admit I'm the type of player who enjoys being a little overpowered, so I do worry about how this will impact my personal gameplay.  But more importantly, I really enjoyed the feel of progression as I first played, stumbling into regions too tough for me, to later return to that region more powerful and more prepared.   That sense of satisfaction and progression was important to keeping my interest.  I don't know what to think now about playing events where I see a full range of leveled players, from 1 to 300, all playing the same, all having similar difficulty settings in the end.
---
I do want the BOS elder battlecoat returns
---
Perfect response, simply perfect üëå
---
Your response was totally justified.  Losing a pet sucks.  
---
RIP Humphrey!
---
Again, you are making up the narrative that the events are there for farming XP.  
---
* Me: "The goal of the event is to protect the ASAM"
---
* You: "Lol, that's not the goal of the event"
---
* Me: &lt;&lt;Posts the literally description of the event&gt;&gt;
---
* You: "Go ahead and rush"
---
* Me: ????
---
You are trying to say that now that we have this SCORE system, everything is different now.  So when people see the public quest for Line in the sand and think "hey I can earn a couple of extra treasury notes" those people are wrong for going there and trying to complete the event to get the notes.  
---
You STILL are trying to play off exploiting the event as Ok.  Look, if you want to do it, I can't stop you.  I guess you won't understand the impact that can have on the server and how it can screw up with people who aren't even at the event. But I guess you don't understand the difference between doing the right thing and doing things right
---
Is that how we play this game now?  
---
Oh, and having more friends in the game is suddenly going to change my opinion on the exploit.  Why don't we start abusing the dupe glitch too while we're at it? Or does that somehow now cross a line with you?  Or maybe it doesn't.
---
Speaking of last time someone did this, which was earlier today for me, i ended up crashing üòî
---
Yep, defensive laughter is my little black dress. I never play 76 without it! Still love it though! üíú
---
When they shut down the game for good.
---
You'd think that kind of thing would be a high priority just makes no sense
---
Spot on.
---
Theres a thread for all of them but rn off the top of my head Ik adrenaline, action boy/girl, serendipity, fireproof, sneak, dead man running and the increased duration weapon perks are either completely broken or not working the way theu should be
---
You're a god.
---
You said it sucked that you couldn't trade your weapon. I replied by saying that duping is still an issue so why would Bethesda allow the new weapons be sold?
---
Im actually starting to enjoy NW! I was doing the whole lockpick challenge partied with a group that was really good! Lockpicked 2 boxes, got marine armor and a gatling gun, insta melted 2 dudes, feeling good. We got some lucky zones and ended up fortifying a tower during the last zone, just us and three other players. Suddenly im getting punched to death by an invisible, unkillable hacker douche....rest of the team suffered the same fate...yay fun...but hey atleast i got my challenge done?
---
Completely agree. How dare they force me to chew bubblegum or harvest vegetables. I want to hide in bushes with my bow, hunting players.
---
PlayStation?
---
I havnt downvoted shit.  Yet dude has multiple downvotes but it was all me right?  Smh.   Another peasant probably with an eBay gun coming to his defense.
---
Yeah, this. 
---
As far as I know barring power armor it's the only thing that 100% negates falling damage.
---
Thanks üôè
---
The tweaked receiver appears to do the same amount of damage - I'm assuming this is not intentional, though if it is it seems like there's really no reason to use the Powerful.
---
Oh yea I don‚Äôt blame you actually if it fun it fun 
---
But give the game a try , I was against it in eso but I keep playing and now I‚Äôm totally for it it make the whole playing experience better. 
---
I can‚Äôt wait for it to be the same in fallout 76
---
Yeah, that's an improvement to the Ammo Converter, but it's still not really where it needs to be.
---
Let me spell it out:
---
* Player puts any kind of ammo and quantity they want into the spinny grinder bit.  It's a personal container UI, just like the Scrip Grinder.
---
* You use the Terminal to confirm scrapping that ammo.
---
* The Terminal processes the ammo and automatically converts it to the relevant number of Ammo Points based on quantity and type.
---
* The Terminal provides a list of ammo to buy with said points, and lets you do that.
---
The ability to read disparate items in a bin and spit out an amalgamated result is something the Scrip Grinder and the Mama Dolce ingredients hopper both have to do.  Why can't the same idea be applied to ammo?  Because even if you streamline this system, I'm not going to be going back-and-forth for 30 .38 here and 20 .44 there.
---
Is it because you desperately want to have a minimum amount you can turn in for AmmoPoints?  Well, get over it.  Change your AmmoPoint currency so that every bullet is worth at least 1 and adjust your prices accordingly.
---
(The irony of how this problem also reflects our lack of ammo bulking is not lost on me).
---
Rank 39 - have completed every daily/weekly challenge and obtained the rest just from XP gains from playing. High level player (645) and run a lot of content, so the xp gains are easy. Fully expect to complete the run in week 5 at this rate.
---
One of these days I am going to count how many "for fuck sakes" I mutter while playing (and being disconnected or having quest/event/daily being bugged)
---
That's such a weird coincidence, because I just worked out how to do this myself yesterday while messing around in a workshop. I also figured out how to do it without foundations. You blueprint 2 stacked posts. You can set the posts without a foundation if they're blueprinted. Then attach a set of stairs to the upper post and then blueprint the upper post and stairs. Now you can sink the post+stairs into the ground without a foundation, for a more "natural" look. Then stack the stairs as the video shows.
---
It has better stats - it just doesn't have the carry bonus / ore collecting one.
---
One is better for combat, the other is better for resource gathering.
---
You‚Äôre the only person feeding the troll so much, you‚Äôre easily manipulated. This is your down time and this is what you‚Äôre doing? When you argue with a fool no one can tell the difference.
---
F for respects
---
&gt;So here we are again, stuck with the legendary perk upgrade system‚Äã, that is not only tedious as hell, but **also punishes players who played a lot with their builds switching stats**...
---
This is my biggest issue, thank you for articulating this problem!
---
&gt; *but 250 levels per a fully upgraded perk is quite a lot to ask for*
---
Bethesda wants to make you feel like a f\*\*\*\*\*g clown for NOT using the godmode glitch smh...
---
What is your PC specs? You can check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byE4qyx8kwA) video to get the right settings.
---
spending in game caps on a buff is pay to win..?
---
‚ÄúVisitors again? Interesting‚Äù
---
I suggest doing scorched earth I seem to always get some flux from that I have 2 I could give you
---
Yesss!! 
---
My real sideburns are some thiccies too lmao
---
I‚Äôll have to try that for myself thank you
---
I‚Äôm using several of these perks. I‚Äôm pretty sure they are working for me. Which isn‚Äôt to say they aren‚Äôt for others. But yo say, if the bug isn‚Äôt effecting everyone then it‚Äôs going to be much harder for them to find what the issue is.
---
The guys who control the economy are dupers themselves of course. :)
---
The people who complain are the guys who dont want to take the risk of duping and then try to trade their be pistol for a b3325 fixer and complain about the people who wont give them anything.
---
We should get an option to shut them up like we side with the liberty prime
---
Thanks for your input.
---
I‚Äôm somewhat new to this game, scorched earth is an event right?
---
I play the game casually in the way I play but the length I play is hardcore lol
---
"I really, and I mean really, wanna be in a band someday."
---
Yeah like a big fun team doing Arktos and 3 friends doing fine...when I crash I really feel I let the group down too
---
Its still the weirdest thing that the soonest update is just 1 world boss lol.
---
Well calling XP, Score and Reputation a currency is rather grossly abusing the use of the term, as is doing the same for the Pleasant Valley Tokens (which were in the original game, as they're specifically linked to the Raider questline of the main game).
---
For THAT matter, the Mr. Fuzzy Tokens and Lode Baring tokens aren't currency either, since you can't exchange them beyond the one place. They're redeemable tokens, yes, but that's to allow players to customize the kind of reward they get (same with legendary scrip, which is so much better than having a legendary you can't use with your build and can't sell to a vendor because NPC resale prices in this game are crap)
---
It hasn't blown up enough. If it doesn't blow up, they aren't going to say shit and, for some reason, few people care or are supporting posts about this. It's even more fucked up when you consider that people can pay cash for ranks. "Oh your game bugged out? We're sorry.. you can still buy atoms to rank up though! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
---
I wasn't blaming anybody I was explaining why they got down votes.
---
That‚Äôs all this game is, a time sink. If you find yourself on for more than 3 hours a day you most likely have end game items and arnt struggling to clear content
---
You should buy it
---
No i am saying let people do whatever the fuck they want lmaooo, nowhere do i complain about people not caring about my opinion. But the PITA situation was created by none other than yourself? You lack the ability to take into account you put urself in this situation. In addition you fail to recognize that calling someone unintelligent without providing real agrument isnt an argument. Finally i would like to say that your articulation and comprehension skilld are subpar at best. Come back down to planet earth where you belong champ!
---
At this point double SCORE needs an extension &amp; it aint even here yet lmaooooooo
---
yeah. it only happens when someone nukes fissure site prime
---
They don't care. And apparently most of the posters here don't either, so it'll only get worse in the future. People love grabbing their ankles for Bethesda.
---
just randomly join a public team or create your own.
---
Not sure if Twitch is something you use but there are tons of great communities over there and they always welcome new people.
---
Suggest that she store them in displays as she collects them. They won‚Äôt be scrapped that way.
---
Yeah
---
I know some of them are suppsoedly intermittent, like action boy works most of the time for me but soem are completely not working like adrenaline and sneak
---
Yes. Other buffs require getting items or making items. This is just removing that step. And frankly isn‚Äôt needed. And while things dint have to make perfect sense on the game.
---
This is just an idea that has no real value or game lore or anything for it or to support it.
---
Ha my wife blew up plenty when it happened to her lol
---
I can just give you 5, I think I have enough lol. Message me
---
Wow! The ammo factory with full perks will be great for crafting 2mmEC!!!!!
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs the scorch beast queen event. Done by launching a nuke on fissure sight prime.
---
Tin Cans
---
If you are at a place where you can craft legendary armor, aim for Unyielding with a +1 Strength modifier. Can give you up to 5 extra strength. 6 if you also have that on your weapon. That will also give you guaranteed Strength that won't change if you accidentally lose your Rads or if on a re-spawn after death you have less rads/more health than you want (happens to me often).
---
My opinion, but I think it also depends on what you are going to be mostly doing. I had my two-handed ranging between 700-900 (depending on team size, time of day perks, etc), and was still able to one shot high level enemies (like ghouls in Radiation Rumble or West Tek Super Mutants). I just added Adrenal Reaction and it jumped to close to 1200, which is more than high enough for most things that I do.
---
I actually have a nuclear launch key I found on a cargo. Haven‚Äôt done my research yet so idk what to do with it
---
I‚Äôd say buying or trading for the ammo is the best way. But you could gather a lot of the materials needed and use ammosmith and super duper perk cards for the best results while crafting it
---
not just fix it, but compensate those affected with free SCORE/free atoms/SCORE opportunities. nobody should have to grind even harder on an already demanding grind because the game fucked them.
---
this is bullshit.
---
i looked at all the new perk cards. and they do not offer anything to me the solo player who is a normal ranged hunter. so the entire grind process is pointless and i don't plan on doing anything with it at all. i dont run sneak builds, i dont throw stuff at monsters, i'm not melee or a team player. so yall have fun with it.
---
Easiest is to buy it from other players. Best way is personal preference.  Some people prefer just buying it others prefer farming materials and crafting it.  If you are high enough level get the ammosmith and super duper perks and learn where to get ore and acid mainly.
---
You're welcome, and thanks for making the video showing people how to do something that frankly should be able to be done without jumping through hoops!
---
Radeon 5700 XT, Ryzen 5 3600x, 16gb 3200mhz ram. I just tried the low preset from the settings I'll check the video out in a bit though
---
Yup. Alot of wishful thinking going on in this sub...there really is so much potential for this game, i get it, but the fact is the devs are going to do their absolute best to make sure they GET THEIR NUT FIRST. Literally everything else will secondary to that. This game will NEVER get the polish it deserves and the quicker we all realize that the better... : (
---
Never
---
Take advantage of weekly dupes, hang around higher level players at their camps until they drop gear for you, etc
---
I think public teams are pretty safe, from what I have seen. A lot of the teams I‚Äôve been on are content for everyone to do their own thing, but enjoy the fast travel benefits. Others want to ride as a pack. I was kicked off a team once, maybe by accident or maybe to make room for somebody‚Äôs friend or maybe my overencumbered toon couldn‚Äôt keep up with what the group wanted to do. So I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into it or let the weird team experience you had put you off of public teams altogether. You may want to try creating a team yourself to have more control.
---
If it puts players at some kind of disadvantage, especially one where it could cost them Atoms in the long run, it is often the *last* thing to be fixed.
---
Craft it yourself and get lots of lead with excavator pa in the Lucky Hole Mine run.  Also make sure to use super duper perk cards and the more ammo when crafting.
---
Yea so u do quests some are good some are shitty but building is fun and all ,but its so buggy. But the battlepass is cool and the wastelanders quests are fun and gold is fun to gring for                                                           TL;DR its fun buggy but fun in different ways
---
Man I am so glad I stopped playing this game. I still come to this sub for a good laugh and Bethesda never seems to disapoint me in this regard. What a shitshow.
---
Find it. Make it. Buy it. All options work equally well.
---
Part of the game is going out and finding the stuff you need to survive. It's not all just blowing up the Queen, and other mobs.

when you do the enclave quest line you‚Äôll get access to the silos and the quest i am become death where you‚Äôll be able to launch a nuke with a keycard and a launch code
---
I've never had this issue on Xbox.
---
Whew there is a long line of deleted messages after this did they have a heated "gamer" moment.
---
Sorry - was off for a few days.   How does 8k sound?
---
You had me with, "*Making coins as a middle step to upgrade legendary perks is tedious and totally uncalled for.*" I fully agree with this observation.
---
The current iteration of Legendary Perks I find lackluster personally. I do like the Ammo one, I leveled it up to two star and equiped Ammosmith, 315 .50 cal rounds per click is a nice thing to see. But that was really it, nothing substantial for Power Armor or Heavy Weapons, unless I missed them. The Legendary Stat cards would be better, in my opinion, if they let us push past the Max of 15.
---
Craft it with ammosmith and super duper perks. You craft 180 .50 rounds a pop and it's pretty easy to keep a stockpile of lead, steel, and gunpowder.
---
Player vendors
---
No. When I do events I kill shit as fast as possible so i can get it done and head to the next event.
---
 I have no interest in whether or not you tag every mob, that would take centuries to finish the event.
---
 I'm not farming enemy XP nor do I care about the enemies XP. I'm farming events, faster kill times equal more events.
---
Yeah its a gate loader...you put cartridges into it.
---
A black powder revolver would take ball ammo or black powder cartridges which arent in the game, not .44
---
Just proof that Gamers are the most oppressed race. /s
---
I've tried that but people didn't seem interested to talk pluss the voice chat ting in the game is not really optimized
---
i haven't done my weeklies yet which ones are bugged?
---
last week camp workshop / gather resources / destroy robots bugged for me.
---
I've also found that the Cushioned leg armor mods don't stack with the legendary perk. I had two legs with Cushioned (should be 40% each) plus one legendary falling damage reduction, and I still got damage. I bought the Cushioned for my Secret Service hoping that it would save me trying to roll Unyielding with Fall Damage Reduction (already had unyeilding), but no such luck. Wasted bullion...
---
Just checked ingame, modules are still worth 50 scrip
---
I'll try that, Tnx
---
I don't generally laugh at that, I tend to mumble a few vulgarities and restart the game.
---
Never did the vault raid because I didn't have people to play with, yes please bring the raids back!!!

---
At the very least, they don't play it like their veteran player base does.  They seem fundamentally incapable of seeing the game as we see it.
---
Yikes the replies you got from your satire post LMAO! I'm convinced all the cool people are online playing and all the toxic ones are hanging out on reddit complaining.
---
My goal is to have a set of each type of PA and switch around when I need to.  I am not a fan of the look of the excavator so I put the liberty prime skin on it.
---
This is a render with a bmp img file, the bmp file is the flowers you can see on the canvas frame it was a painting a lil kid did in Microsoft paint, so it is possible to add thumbnails as pictures they don't weight too much. [render](http://imgur.com/gallery/0KDtoUr)
---
Getting mods for it is a pain, otherwise it's great armor. 
---
Putting calibrated shocks on it to increase carry weight is going to require finding another player to do it for you or getting extremely lucky and having the plan drop.  
---
I would suggest using either x01 or level 50 t51 eventually since you can just buy the plans for the mods and be done with it.  If you are good with the low carry weight for the time being though then go ahead and rock the ultracite armor.
---
A scorched running up and hiding behind something, even when you circle around and flank them is the illusion of tactics. Big difference 
---
Of course the various AI have various behaviors. That doesn't mean it is real, adjustable thought like real people have
---
I had a feeling they were going to make all the challenges harder after the two weeks are up but now I think they meant to have it auto complete to put the unsuspecting player at even more of a disadvantage
---
And yet here you are.  Take ur own advise buddy.
---
I buy them any time I see them tbh always need some
---
Dude it was satire, basically poking fun on all the "Don't make me do X" posts...like stop.
---
They don't need balancing, other prefixes need a buff so they are more useful.
---
The General's Steakhouse is small and easy to clear in a couple minutes.  It's usually populated with a couple minigun-wielding super mutants on the second floor, as well as a couple more miniguns on tables.  I usually come away with a few hundred rounds of 5mm.  That won't keep you going for long, but it's quick and easy.
---
Otherwise, it's probably easiest to just farm for lead weights (monorail elevator, workout room in the flatwoods hotel, workout room in the missile silos, makeshift batteries and various toys everywhere) and gunpowder. Cloth and acid aren't that hard to come by, and super mutants also often carry a few units of powder.  Also check the raider corpses in the various old raider strongholds.
---
so how do you get Legendary perks anyway?
---
That says more about the selection of content we have than anything.  Currently we have absolutely no end game progression content for groups.
---
I heard they added it to the daily challenges
---
Agreed I just like hearing people opinions
---
The point of a battle royale oddly enough is to live...it's not a death match.
---
Don't worry about doing it wrong.  Play just like a regular Fallout game and have fun.  I linked to a conversation with some great resources to check out after you get your feet wet*.  Welcome!
---
*Don't actually get your feet wet, the radiation will make your toenails fall off.
---
I hate NW because if fucks me out of SCORE by auto-completing my adventure mode challenges
---
get 25 vats criticals was buged along with claim workshops I belive there might have been another but I'm not sure
---
Also dont  forget to use the converter to convert those rounds you don't used into what you can, I go around and buy up, arrows and .44 and turn into 50 cal not the best but every bit helps!
---
Still exactly 1.5 more cats than I have ever expected to be possible to have around my camp :D
---
You are misinterpreting me, the original (and many of the current reproduction SAA revolvers) were chambered for .44-40 WCF, which was originally a black powder cartridge. All of the original metallic cartridges were black powder. It is not unreasonable to include something like the SAA with other originally black powder weapons. Black Powder does not always mean muzzle loading or cap and ball like a New Model Army or something.
---
Youre why people use /s
---
Take your excavator armor to Lucky Hole and mine all the lead and smelt it down with super duper. If you want more lead go to the top of the monorail elevator and pick up all the weights. You can also go to the gyms in Flatwoods and the Charleston fore station for more... And than also the gyms in the Silo's. Once you have a massive amount of lead you'll want to go farm West Tek/Generals Steak House/Cravass Dam for a bit and pickup all the Gunpowder, Assault Rifles and miniguns you can. You can server hop this part for awhile. With scrapper equipped those guns will net you a lot of steel. Than convert it all to bullets with ammosmith and super duper.
---
I agree, I‚Äôm hoping they learned and the new dlc will fix this and not feel like all I have to do is play for a week and everything is finished until next time
---
#JusticeForHumphrey
---
Something you need to understand. 
---
Content guys. The guys who design quests and artists who make skins and models. ect.
---
And the Bug fixing guys are usually different people, even different departments all together.
---
So basically what you're asking for is for Bethesda to tell the plumber to stop installing the new sink and make the plumber help fix the stairs instead. When you already have a carpenter team.
---
The plumber should just do the sink and the carpenters should fix the floors and shit.
---
Asking them to hire more carpenters would be the best idea, dont force them to use plumbers to fix flooring.
---
So you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre a fool?
---
Don't be a scumbag cheater/exploiter.
---
Bloodied is 5% chunks, so max is 95% because at 100% you're at 0% HP.
---
Junkies is 10% per addiction up to a max of 50%
---
F in chat for Humphrey
---
Salty salty salty
---
Yes yes u r right dude
---
Strange in Numbers is annoying because it destroys my Berserker.  I'm sure the 5 other people who play Berserker agree.
---
I wish you could just decline the effects of a shared card.   Tired of constantly having to leave teams.
---
My XB1X runs like a slide show in most areas. I'm gonna try running it at a lower resolution but I doubt it helps.
---
Thats just wrong. You should be able to find a legendary before nw even places you on the map.
---
I tend to sigh despondently.
---
10% per addiction , maximum of 5
---
Bloodied is a problem only because there is no "risk" versus huge rewards for using it. With the increase in stash size + Fallout 1st stash boxes, death has no meaning anymore.
---
I believe the original intent was to have the Bloodied build as a true "glass cannon" - and players would have to really think about what death would mean for them.
---
Nowadays, bloodied builds can die, respawn, die, respawn, die again, etc. without any real risk. That's part of the problem.
---
Personally, I don't have a problem with the build - I don't run it, but lots of people do - but again, the original intent just isn't valid anymore.
---
Thankyou
---
yah but you dont see it that way lmaooo
---
Dont have THE answer but I assume it's because they are the strongest damaging builds out there so people flock to them. Making other people complain. I dont think they need balancing.
---
Amen. 
---
I lost a clean mr. handy's fuel after farming for it forever. I just recently obtained replacements and I dread putting them in a display case again. It's amazing how much I've lost from display cases since wastelanders went live.
---
Wow! Can finally use gauss mini to shoot every single enemy in game
---
So now ur feeding the troll.  I can keep playing peasant.
---
It's the perk cards 
---
This isn't a balanced fight even taking skill out of the equation 
---
If you have the weapon that you have speced half your deck into, of course you are going to tear people apart 
---
That's just how this particular game is built. If you like it better the way other games have it, than those games are available. I personally appreciate that it isn't an exact carbon copy of other games 
---
What level are you by the way? I found a massive improvement when I was speced high enough to get all my cards i want slotted

Thats one of my biggest gripes with this game! Aside fron all the other bullshittery, id like to see all the chad weaps/bugs/exploits etc balanced/removed and make the game freakin harder. Right around lvl 30 i was struggling. I didnt really know how to make a proper build, no legendaries, just me and my base weaps doing the best i could and it was fun and CHALLENGING. After you figure out a proper build and get the weaps/armor to match the game just gets way to easy mode....i could always just gimp myself but...id just like a real legit challenge (not imposter) for a change. Maybe open all the vaults with mega hard unique enemies/bosses/challenges...i know itll never happen but a man can dream : /
---
Thanks man, appreciate you getting back to me
---
Lol :D
---
I had previously played 76 on the bethesda store, would my saves carry over?
---
Best tip I can give you right now si that you check the Camps of players set around the starting area: many have them geared precisely to help new players, so they will likely have facilities and items at low costs that help you find your footing.
---
You can also check the Wayward, a hotel-bar added with Wastelanders that also adds a few things for beginners.
---
Regarding special, while ideally it would be better to have an idea of what loadout you are aiming for, after level 50 you can move Special points from one category to another, so the system is definitely flexible if you change your mind later on.
---
One perk that I could recommend early on is the lead belly perk, which will make your life easier while you start getting Radaway at more consistent pace, which is specially important since right now FO76 needs you to constantly eat &amp; drink, both of which 99% of the time add rads. Bethesda did say that they will soon change these mechanics to make it supplemental instead of having negative effects when not tended to, but for the time being you will have to manage hunger &amp; thirst.
---
Sleep is not necessary, but not only is it a means to recover your health, if you sleep for 30 seconds you will get a rested or well rested bonus effects that grants bonus experience for a while. Similarly, if you find a musical instrument that you can play (normally next to a chair), do so for 30 seconds &amp; you will get a well tuned bonus effect, which increases your AP regeneration for a while.
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid of dying, all you lose is your junk, which you can pick from your death spot afterwards. If you just stashed your junk in your stash box, then dying doesn‚Äôt really have a negative consequence, unless you are in the middle of nowhere, since respawning needs to be done at a discovered location.
---
There are several other things, but I have to run now, will try to drop by later to post more.
---
They weren't played because the rewards were generally garbage.
---
Every run consumed so much ammunition and equipment durability, just to get a steamer trunk at the end and some Vault Steel. Zero XP. If there was something to make it worthwhile, they would be a lot more used. 
---
I really enjoyed the few I was able to do before they were taken offline. In fact, some of the most complex events the game has seen were in the raids, instead of the usual 'kill monsters' or 'collect' things.
---
So tokens are something you use to exchange for an item and it's not a form of currency? XP and levels I grouped because you use them to buy perk cards and score though you may not have a choice to customise its still earned in order to be exchanged for goods/cosmetics. And I never said scrip is bad or worse then selling for legendaries but by definition it's a form of currency as something you accumulate to be exchanged for something.
---
Because then each round of ammo would have to be worth at least 1 point and they would have to rescale all of the prices.
---
Yeah I kinda get what OP is saying but they've reached hard for things to call currency.
---
I'd suggest following the main quest for the first 10-20 levels (and any side quests associated with that), before you start just randomly following high level players while exploring or jumping into random events. A lot of what high level players do will lead you to a death loop as a new player (like &gt;!Scorchbeast Queen!&lt;). Plus if you are in it for the story, jumping ahead will make no sense, like &gt;!Yay! You just killed the Scorchbeast Queen, you're next quest is to uncover the mystery of what Scorched is because no one knows yet!&lt;.
---
Try avoiding fast travelling at first - you will discover so much more, even as you are going to places you've already been.
---
(Spoiler tags unnecessary for experienced players, but throwing them in for anyone who doesn't want the main quest spoiled.)
---
Scortchbeast Queen is the worst for it. I usually tell myself I didn't need an AA shovel anyways
---
Il take that railway rifle ammo off your hands if you cant be bothered.
---
Yeah the gameplay is so engaging, sitting afk doing nothing instead of doing any gameplay, its genious, wy do i even play games when i can do nothing and stare at my screen at a giant bush! lol
---
You want me to unlock 3 safes in NW, Bethesda? Yeah, fuck that shit.
---
Awesome.  That skin works for it? I didn't know. I will definitely look into that.
---
The same logic can be applied to any build use rank 2 cola nut and stand naked infront of anything pop a couple grapes or oranges or even quantums boom invulnerable
---
I‚Äôm on east coast and I play every evening. I play with a streamer named Maow... he‚Äôs very nice and chill, and his community is just as nice, he‚Äôs a relatively small streamer so it‚Äôs a very nice intimate stream... we run around and do whatever having fun.... my name is SentReznor in game feel free to add me homeboi
---
Lmfaoooooo wow you‚Äôre special I wasn‚Äôt expecting this turn of events.
---
Oh, ok. That makes sense
---
I got a way to fix it...remove it completely cause it sucks and toss the effort into fixing the main game instead of the welfare gamemode they have.
---
damn , course its the easier ones
---
&gt;  How could they have not known that late-game players would not have tons of ammo saved up and want to be able to exchange large quantities.
---
The devs don't play their own game. and looking at the PTS feedback on Legendary perks and A COLOSSAL PROBLEM shows that even more
---
Examples:
---
A COLOSSAL PROBLEM is now limited to 2 teams of 4 (8 PLAYERS PER INSTANCE) for a public event and the person who nukes it is not even guaranteed to get into the instance with a full team.
---
Legendary Perks require a new currency, Perk Coins, that is an even worse grind than Score, Rep, and Gold Bullion combined. The perks are hit or miss and requires a perk point to now remove a perk, WHICH WAS NOT A THING WHEN THEY FIRST INTRODUCED THE LEGENDARY PERKS IN THE PTS! And if they add more Legendary perks in the future (which I would assume they would), it is going to make the grind even more impossible. because as of right now, [it will take 1335 levels just to max 6 out of the 15 cards and that assumes that you have scrapped every card you have ever gotten and have not received any 1* duplicated cards and lost those points.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ho4lha/perk_coins_an_absolutely_insane_endeavor/) Most High levels that I see are around the 200-350 mark. Let's assume it took someone about 1.5 years (547.5 days) to reach level 250, it would require them to level 5.34 times over to reach level 1335, which would take about 8.01 YEARS (2923.65 days) just to max out 6 perk cards while having no perks cards.
---
Hell, there are interviews from the devs where they even talk about using first aid and ammo vending machines! I dont know any Fallout 76 player that as ever used one of those.
---
No I got it, you're just talking about reality while im talking about the game guns.
---
How about you make the ammo converter work like the ammo vending machines that are already in the game? 
---
Get rid of the terminal, let the player select the converter itself and bring up a screen just like the ammo vending machine. 
---
The player then clicks on the ammo they want to "sell" from the left side and get points for selling it. Then when the player is ready to buy, use the right side of the screen to buy the ammo they want. 
---
All while using the same slider used to adjust quantities that is already in player vending machines and at vendors!
---
Unless you don't want to Bethesda because you don't want to have an unfixable exploit that will more than likely come with that.
---
Certainly not common. Sorry I can‚Äôt be of any more help beyond that.
---
This could be an unpopular opinion at this point, but... I'm kinda thinking they should just scrap the entire system as planned and start over. Some of the perks offered are almost pointless, while others, like Legendary Ability, will be so significant as to reshaping your entire build. That one would be fantastic to have... but with how long it will take to actually get ranked up properly, how many people will be able to plan on it being any meaningful part of their build? Especially since you might be looking at the better part of 100 levels of playing before being able to get anything to show for it...
---
I wish they'd just looked at Diablo 3's Paragon system and tried to rip that off. Have a bunch of bonuses like health, rad resist, AP, carry weight, VATS hit chance, bonus ammo crafting, etc, and be able to rank one of those up *every* level, but with each individual rank being very small - health and rad resist could be just +1or +2 per rank, VATS hit chance just 0.2%, ammo crafting +1% - and have caps on most of them, but high enough that they'll add up. (Keeping with the VATS hit chance idea, with a cap at 100 ranks, +0.2% chance per rank, it'd be +20% once maxed out!)
---
*Plus*, they could have some bonuses have no cap on them, allowing you to continue leveling them up indefinitely - maybe things like health or action points? (Though this would need a condition added that these bonuses would be disabled in PvP, for the sake of balance). It'd give you *something* to do, and something to show for it, no matter how far you'd keep leveling up - whereas with the current cards system, if you *would* **somehow** hit that level 3600 to max out *everything*... that'd be it, you'd be "done". At which point, supposing you somehow hadn't burned out from the grind by then, what would be next? But with a system like this, and additional grinding would still count for *something*.
---
inb4 they say it will come out in the next patch, a month from now
---
It is the best time to buy everything will be deflated... Hey hey that BFRFR fixer for 3k caps sure why not, legacy TSERW90 Flamer 6k caps fuck yeah. BE gat plasma for 5k oh yeah.  
---
Edit: the methodology has been around since forever only a handful ever used it though and I honestly thought it got patched out back in March '19 but I was informed they had moved onto other methods and it was never patched.
---
A while back I tested various mods and found there to be less recoil with the default short barrel than the long barrel. I was surprised since you‚Äôd think it would be the opposite.
---
It‚Äôs still a TON of recoil but that might help you a little bit. 
---
Disclaimer: It‚Äôs possible this is no longer the case since I tested this months ago and haven‚Äôt retested since then.
---
I FINALLY got my last piece of 3* unyielding ss armor (fall damage leg thank fuck)...so much scrip holy shit....i guess its finally time to save up for that nifty jetpack...But seriously, give us a discount on the damn legendary modules and ill call gg, most of the time its just wasted scrip, better off with a good legendary farming route.
---
It does!
---
up to 5 addictions for a total of 50% extra damage.  10% damage per addiction.  
---
I don't have it handy, but there's a pretty good list someone on FB put together of all the drugs and the withdrawal effects so you can choose what best to get addicted to.
---
a minute of silence for all the lost things, comrade.
---
People don‚Äôt want to hear this they‚Äôd rather have every build do 0 damage so they can wear power armor and feel OP
---
Only the slots are account wide, the actual perk upgrades aren't. Edit: to clarify, the first level of all cards is unlocked by default for everyone, each character has to level up its own cards, upgrades are not shared.
---
And only the ones unlocked by your highest level character matter, meaning if you have a character lv 150 and three characters lv 50 you still only have the slots unlocked by the 150, and not all six slots.
---
The system still has a very long way to go.
---
I STAN WITH HUMPHREY
---
R.I.P
---
This all day long.  They originally said, every 50 levels you'd get a legendary perk point.  Nice and straightforward no need to touch perk cards at all.
---
can anyone show a picture of the current version?
---
Ugh filthy non ironic casuls
---
and it is even sadder that this is the first new Nuke Boss to be added since launch.
---
Adding new ones makes players seem to forget the issues with previous. Biggest complaints in the past were about scrip. Those all but disappeared when bullion was introduced. Now its all about SCORE. Next people will be so concerned with Legendary Perks that not having enough SCORE will no longer be an issue. Seems like a way of avoiding meeting player's wants.
---
Only exception seems to be the recent news about the ammo converter, with the cap for that increasing ALOT.
---
They couldn't patch it before or the same time as that kronky ammo converter ü§î
---
I'm not the one throwing mental illness around like an insult because someone didnt get a shitty joke.
---
‚ÄúOne less menu to press through‚Äù LOL why even bother Bethesda if your not gonna try.
---
We get it you don't have any good weapons to dupe.
---
Love it. Ur trying to call me out for feeding a troll and being ‚Äúsalty‚Äù and here U are still replying to me.
---
I love breach and clear but it always so laggy. I just feel like a potato farm
---
Don‚Äôt focus on builds. Just enjoy the game and explore. Micro transactions are not an issue at all, despite what you hear. You don‚Äôt need to spend any money on the game. 
---
Repair gear at workbenches. You don‚Äôt need repair kits.
---
The atomic shop is just clothes, skins, and camp items.... and the useless repair kits I already explained you do not need.
---
Where you online and playing at the reset time?  That has been the problem.  For now, it's important to be out of the game completely at reset time, staying off for a good 10 minutes.
---
At least until they fix this glitch.
---
Nice to assume I didn't... I did, but I hated the change in eso and it ruined any sense of progress and fun for me.   I hadn't started long before they changed it either so it wasn't some sense of nostalgia or anything.
---
I just didn't like it, and it felt like Evey level just made me weaker and weaker.  Gear never seemed to progress much either.  I quit before I hit level 30 (I was 10 or so when they changed it)
---
So I tried, strongly dislikes it, and quit playing.  I really really dislike that they're bringing that mess here and will ruin what was a fun game again üòï
---
Also, I still fail to see what they are fixing with this.  All it will do is erase any sense of character growth.
---
With a normal MMO, you can point to raid gear and gear tiers (grey/white/green/blue/purple or whatever).  None of that exists here.  Anyways, I appreciate the replies and I hope you enjoy it... Someone better
---
So, your level determines how many slots you have? Is there a limit? I think I remember that level 300 was the highest level that mattered for slots, right?
---
Is there any practical benefit to having multiple high level characters?
---
How long does it last?  Through noon Tuesday?  Trying to stretch out my 4 max scrip characters over the length of the sale and not blow it all in one day LOL
---
It worked wonders for ESO so I'm pretty open minded about it. Hope it works out for everyone.
---
Do fractions not exist in post-apocalyptic America? And I thought not using the metric system was bad.
---
Your character, items etc will carry over
---
Your atoms won't, but the atom shop items you own will, so you can either spend your atoms now and still have the items you bought
---
Or if there's nothing you want, you can just leave them there and spend them later, I'd probably recommend this if you're interested in the Legendary Run Season
---
Get your Season progress as high as possible then spend the atoms on the last bit you need before it ends
---
All the ranks cost 150 atoms, but the score amount required goes up with each one
---
So buying higher ranks is better value
---
Fallout 1st subscription will also not carry over if you have it, so I would recommend canceling the recurring billing, then finishing that subscription out on the Bethesda launcher before making the switch
---
jeez all you guys stalking this day old post and downvoting BOS comments need to get a life
---
it is Bethesda we are talking about. just guessing at the spaghetti code that they are working with, pushing out a hotfix might all of sudden make the daily challenges reward atoms again instead of Score
---
Feel pretty good about using roughly 100 levels to respec my build, which leaves me way behind in this system. 
---
Screw it, I‚Äôll just keep playing the way I want and skip this nonsense.
---
Yes there is. Anything you can sell to vendors.
---
I mean it‚Äôs an improvement, but THE TERMINAL INTERFACE WAS THE PROBLEM!! Why would you make a converter use a terminal? They always miss the mark
---
I just want the theramin
---
&gt; Bloodied is a problem only because there is no "risk"
---
Wtih 600DR i get one shotted by those giant supermutant boulder toss. There is a risk, full HP builds are easy mode and shouldnt have the same damage as bloodied. You literally cant die playing full hp builds.
---
Not against it, but those pads take up a LOT of space.
---
Power armor piece
---
9th - 13th
---
It might flip it back and they would still auto correct ü§£
---
Holy hell mate, why don't you go dump that salt back in the dead sea lmao. It was mostly a joke, jeez. You all need to lighten up.
---
Thats what I was thinking of
---
I go by The Wayward at least 3 times a day to RP smelling Duchess' feet so I'm not seeing your point SIR
---
But my DPS is significantly lower.
---
Tbh, am an on &amp; off day 1 player, havent finished anything past Belly of the Beast (barely got to it in June lmaooo) and am 1 mission into Settler and rescuing Ra-Ra for Raiders. 
---
I really only came back for seasonal content year 1, came back for Wastelanders &amp; I just wander around, scavenge and build my camp up. 
---
So no endgame items, no endgame period lol. Just a lvl 78 traveling scavver.
---
Derp. Mc derpy derp. I am dumb.
---
Mind blown, thanks for the info
---
Haha interesting. Didn‚Äôt notice that. What happened is he said he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it any more and had some generic insult. And then some other people chimed in about how immature a response it was and I guess they all got deleted. 
---
I thought the conversation was pretty civil up until that point, even if we disagreed.
---
It really wouldn't be a bad idea for them to tie the modes together better, such as earning a card pack in adventure grants it for nuclear winter and vice versa.
---
Am I being dumb, how do I unlocked legendary cards? My main was above level 50 when it got introduced, do I need to do something to activate them?
---
God if only we could actually smell her FEET
---
I wish you could set the terminal to convert the ammo like "x becomes y" then just hit the spin button and have it do like 100 at a time
---
Yeah... the increased points cap is nice, I guess, but besides that... *one* less screen to deal with, *yay...* /s.
---
I don't know why they're trying to stick with using a terminal for it, rather than just using a vendor screen. I was guessing *maybe* there could be some sort of behind the scenes technical issue, but... Looking at the scrip machine and the Purveyor, they already have all the systems to make it work - all they'd need to do would be figure out points value per round, rather than per bundle of rounds - so I do **not** get why they won't.
---
Slow your roll chief, an event is an option not an obligation. I don't know why you all take everything so seriously.
---
So I see, oh well. Time to roll a load of weapons instead.
---
It's been broken for me for a while. Other people can pick them up as i have finished the event a few times recently. Are the ingredients disappearing when you go near them?
---
I think the Vault Raids were supposed to be a solution to this. Rotating raids so you had different content each week (correct me if I'm wrong about that, I never actually played them), but they were buggy (hence why I never played them). Even something like a weekly repeatable quest that may be more difficult than regular daily repeatables, but have higher rewards and take more time. I've gotten to the point where I can usually run the bullion trail (Photo Op, Raider Daily, Foundation Daily) in like 10-15 minutes tops, depending on how fast fast travel loads. The only thing that keeps me in longer are daily challenges, and when events like SBQ or Radiation Rumble popup, that may not be difficult, but at least better than killing bugs so that tea can brew or stew can be canned.
---
I actually never knew this when you put it like that I feel kinda dumb.Thanks  for the info
---
nothing is better than a hairy dude with boobies and a bubble butt...
---
Agreed we could use a daily quest as the only reason I go to the wayward anymore is to see smiley for weekly gold.
---
Yep, its especially bad in VATS now, I used to be able to headshot crit legendary scorchbeasts and kill them outright, now I can't even do it to a normal scorchbeast. It will be showing damage numbers in the thousands but doesn't do anything but tickle the enemies. The tiniest sliver of the health bar will be removed and that is it.
---
Thats when I shutdown my PC and cry myself to sleep
---
&gt; It is much easier to finish a NW challenge than find a legendary. 
---
gitgud scrub
---
The button to pick them up is grayed out
---
Always
---
You didn‚Äôt even reach max lvl :( 
---
The update turn the focus on the game about adventuring and character builds  with both abilities and gearset  so it actually became more fun 
---
While yea fo76 isn‚Äôt an mmorpg and doesn‚Äôt have dungeons / raids or gear set but with the lvl sync update that something they could adds 
---
September update also introducing ‚Äúdaily ops‚Äù not much info out yet but god do I hope it turns some of the locations into dungeons
---
Edit: gear quality (Gray/blue/purple/gold) does exist but in nuclear winter mode so there is a chance they will introduce them in regular mode :)
---
I feel like the big problem with the build itself is that it is complete.
---
You get strong weapon effects, armor effects, perks, mutations, chems, food, and even the radiation system itself that all work together to support and improve your build. And all of these components are strong enough on their own to justify their use in a nonspecialized build. But when added together they just blow everything else out of the water.
---
Compare and contrast berserkers. There is a weapon effect, some minor perk and chem support and that's about it, there are no armor effects that support it, no mutations, it's just not a build.
---
Junkies is also not a build, it's just a strong generic effect that works on anything, there is no junkies armor, and the perks are trash. 
---
They really need to flesh out and support the other weapons and builds to make them more whole, as they are all missing critical components that leaves them in a state of unfinished that pales in comparison.
---
Is it me or do the bears look off?
---
We get it the only way you can get good weapons is if they‚Äôre duped
---
Man Bethesda is incompetent...I really have no hope in the game getting better they just don't know what they're doing
---
Bloodied is far and away in the lead, with perks that support it.
---
Junkies is second because it‚Äôs perkless:  run full health, take addictions that don‚Äôt impact your build, and go to town.
---
If other builds had better perk support (berzerker for instance) then we‚Äôd have more variety and people wouldn‚Äôt be annoyed they ‚Äúhad‚Äù to pick one or two optimal paths.  There are other fun paths to be sure, but the top 2 tend to get picked on a lot, such is the nature of online gaming.
---
The problem is even ‚Äúfixing‚Äù these doesn‚Äôt addresses the core problem:  there‚Äôs not a big enough death penalty and mobs aren‚Äôt that hard in the first place.
---
have had this issue three times myself. i'll be collecting the ingredients, and then they will start disappearing before my eyes.
---
Yeah, me too. I have 4 alts with levels between 70 and 140. I already stopped playing with them after Wastelanders release since the gold grind for every character is kinda stupid to begin with (gold plans should become available account-wide after learning imo). Now they want to completely disincentivize us playing our alts with yet another character-bound grind. Smh...
---
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me then. I don‚Äôt really care that I can‚Äôt kill the in one shot, but more the fact that only a sliver of health goes down lol
---
Hell to the fuck no. That shit was hard as hell.
---
We have plenty of events to make use of. Do so.
---
Try not to equate casual players with whiny, Iwanteverythingmywayrightnow kind of players.  There is a big, big, HUGE, bigly difference between the two.
---
I'm casual, and I just want my gauss rifle to work properly.  I don't need it to have 10k damage and award 5,000 SCORE points for ever hit.
---
So yeah - please don't lump casuals in with this other problematic group.
---
I have the same issue with the raiders that spawn at my camp randomly dying after a few minutes. They just fall over and die. I *believe* this started happening after the Wastelanders update.
---
It sucks it‚Äôs like they knew I was going to dodge my family today and renew my FO1 and collect my junk in a saddened stupper: Tragedy
---
Crashes is just a free dlc that we cannot remove at this point if you ask me
---
Yea, stuck on 9 creatures in the garbage that is NW. Whoever comes up with these should have been beat more as a child.
---
Slots are unoocked at set levels, six is the maximum and lv 300 is the level the last slot unlocks for characters created before the perk's launch, otherwise it's 250.
---
There is no benefit at having multiple characters, no. On the contrary it's a bit of a punishment having spent time rerolling. The current system also punishes people who spent points respecing, so it's really an all-around lose situation. You can't cumulate, say, lv 50 slots to unlock all six slots. The cost for upgrading perks is also very prohibitive.
---
It just makes me question why someone would be so stupid as to pay for fallout 1st
---
Cloth and acid will get you gunpower.
---
And maybe one day a world which only allows lore friendly items and skins.
---
I've given up on liking this game and now I'm just waiting for my wife to get sick of it, but it's not like I'm going to let her get wiped out by scorched in the meantime. Plus I'm better at camp building, or so she tells me when she goes off to take a nap.
---
Great feedback, hopefully this gets their attention!
---
I don‚Äôt like to get down on the working woman /man I mean it is still a job/career and things have been hectic here in the US so I don‚Äôt completely blame the devs. I mean we don‚Äôt know how covid 19 affected them personally and how it carried over to their work lives : Empathy
---
It's called a "sour grapes" defense mechanism.
---
Let's start with a game that isn't full of bugs and fuckery then start asking for fun stuff
---
I see your point. Makes sense. 
---
yeah maybe actually it‚Äôll be fun to have a challenge in the older regions again. There‚Äôs a lot of cool places in game that no one walks.
---
For ur information, literally nobody go to this event before the LR begin, 3 at most if someone participated, but these days every time this event pop up there must be above 6. Again, I m suggesting ppl stop one shot whole mob, event will not fail even if u dun one shot them, so what‚Äôs the problem with the objective? Single shot from a blank GL, and the others will do the rest, everyone gain XP everyone happy, objective done reward get, it‚Äôs simple. It‚Äôs my suggestion, u dun like it u go away, u r not doing this then nothing to do wif u, after all u juz try to rationalise the act that actually spoiled other players
---
&gt; Radeon 5700 XT
---
With that graphics card, you should be able to run this game at 100 fps on Ultra settings. Could be vsync in the game and in your driver.
---
It‚Äôs like we are stuck in a catch 22 right?
---
 Maybe more of a buy a buff, get a RNG  debuff....like mutations. Maybe add visual effects. The debuff last 3 hrs and buff last 2 hrs....can only do once every 6 hrs....
---
But cool debuffs...or maybe ill effects or bad omens, such as: nothing randomly drops for normal kills; walk more loudly (attraction); a group of black cats follow u while they make alot of noise; joystick gets reversed; buttons on control pad gets randomized; vendors more expensive(passive - charisma); get hunted by factions/monsters; rng teleportation; weapons jam; rng miss attacks; hazy/disorienting pov; and such
---
Must have bad with the good....nothing too bad, but to the point that u have to decide if it's worth it
---
I'm just a baby back at level 52ish and I can barely stand to log in because it takes me a whole session to get one level nowadays. I'm probably doing something wrong but the requirements for maxing even one card seem incredibly unrealistic for me.
---
Yup.  Getting a lot of crashes recently.  Really great at the end of instanced quests with your junk bag on the floor.
---
Wayward could be a great quest hub. There is one line of dialog where you can ask her if she has any leads on other treasure. There‚Äôs one thread begging to be tugged at. Then there are her hired guns. There could be a lot of unfinished business they need help with. And they could open up any number of quests with the others that hang out there. It‚Äôs all right there if they wanted to open the game up to more story.
---
Well, that sucks, but good to know. Maybe there will still be some positive changes.

It would be interesting if songs were like plans, you could find/purchase "sheet music" in game (not atom store), and if you are the first in an area to start playing an instrument, you get to choose which song you play. Anyone else who joins while you are still playing joins in on the song (regardless of if they know it). 
---
And while we are at it (because my brain is working today), add in a Battle of the Bands event. Make it a non combat PVP (team vs team) to play music while completing other tasks in a defined area (such as fight off waves of enemies). Someone on the team must always be playing music, and you get points for both completing the task and playing music (to avoid just having one person play while the rest do the task). It would add some strategy to the event, which might be a welcome change to some.

Gun fu was broken awhile back.  It got fixed the following patch.  Tenderizer has reportedly always been broken.  Endurance on gear hasn‚Äôt granted HP since FO4.  You need to lower expectations of Bethesda.  Here, have some duped presents and legacies.
---
Lmaaaaaoooooo Me Included friend I‚Äôm guilty I would drive down to Texas my damn self
---
Please turn off team fill before you queue. I get that people don't like NW and shouldn't be forced to play it. That said getting teammates that just leave, afk or hide during fights screws the people that do want to play it.
---
Ya, I know.  I actually have 3 or 4 characters all in their 20s and 30s as I tried different ones to find something fun still.
---
Ended up giving up.  I fear all that will change here is erasing growth.  Everything will be a bullet sponge now. 
---
Tea time? Be ready for max level everything taking multiple hits to kill, all while they destroy the pipes because those were not buffed to hand the higher dmg of NPCs.  I'm sure that will play out across every defend event.
---
Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but my prior experience leads me to that.  Anyways appreciate the chat.  Hope your right but I guess I'm glad cyberpunk 77 should be out soon after to give me something to do üòÇüòÇ
---
For me, this stepps worked, in this order:
---
Set the preset to MEDIUM. Set shadow distance to LOW. Do NOT touch the sliders. Set the other as you wish (like water, shadow, light, models, etc).
---
Also run at full mode, not in windowed.
---
Remember, it just works
---
I have a bar of soap and a sock. I'll be glad to donate these for a proper correction.
---
I really love the game but seeing more and more tone deaf responses like that brings more and more discouraging thoughts about its future.
---
If you want a weapon to dupe all you have to do is be nice üôÑ
---
I got that done after finding a spawn point at the scout camp. There's two safes to pick there.  But today?  Kill NINE creatures in NW????  FFS.
---
Not really no
---
One perk only requires 250 levels, but every consequent upgrade will require more and more xp since it's how levelling system works. And yes, it gets pretty damn insane afterwards, you'll need to be about lvl 1600 to fill all 6 slots with fully upgraded perks. Even 1/4 of that is barely reachable for majority of the playerbase. I dunno what were they thinking...
---
And yeah, after all that you'll end up stuck with one build without any possibility to try something new in forseeable future.
---
And make it more expensive....250, 500, 1000 caps...maybe based on level ... 5, 10, 20 caps per level
---
Genius Tinkerer - Can apply 1/2/3/4 additional mods to PA pieces; PA mods are 100%/200%/300%/400% more effective. Gain access to special PA mods.

---
Nope never. The game hasn't crashed in a long long while for me. I've had the server shutdown a few times from dupers I'm assuming but that hasn't happened for a good while either. I'm even frequently doing glitches like the PA glitch to clip through walls for the nuke silos and to farm vault 76 for the 3 star leg in there. I like to check out the out of bounds areas pretty frequently as well and the game handles it all as if it was designed that way on purpose.
---
I would rather they scrap working on this game and just make a new one
---
Just find a cliff to spawn near and take turns jumping and reviving one another. I managed to do it with two friends and then play out the match after.
---
The legendary perks should be a reward for grinding hundreds of levels.    In its current state, it's just an introduction to a new grind.  That is insult added to injury added to another insult. It is simply unacceptable.
---
As for the perks themselves, I think they are fine.  In my opinion, legendary effects should give you a little bit of a bonus and that is it.  I have always disliked the way legendary weapons work in this game.  In my opinion they should be a nice bonus to add fun to the game.  Instead  they are an absolute necessity that you can't function without. I don't want legendary perks to be that way.
---
Same. Finding three was difficult enough.
---
Well, I would have loved it in the Savage Divide when I was in the 20s and 30s. I got so many level 62 ghouls in the 30s. Fucking hell those things fucked me up.
---
And yes duhhh the only way to get good weapons is to dupe. What's the alternative, pay real money? Wait for a .01% chance? Or trade for an equally unobtainable weapon?
---
Yeah, damned cats flying in from everywhere. Fur and claws
---
This isn‚Äôt that same team as I have been informed recently, so we can‚Äôt blame this dev team for the fallout Creation Engine bugs
---
adrenaline is borked.. could that be the damage issue?
---
Just make a piece instead... much easier
---
Nope. I don‚Äôt use it.
---
Just watched zombieland 2 and that hit different.
---
Or maybe the debuffs happen after the buffs... that would be interesting....
---
I think they tried it and gave up because the NPC's couldn't figure them out
---
I know but I don‚Äôt want to lose hope you know?
---
Sure u can dupe everything u like, coz it doesn‚Äôt bothered me, but the traders will be upset, that‚Äôs different story
---
Thanks for the clarification friend. This sounds crazy, I‚Äôve played since beta casually and am about level 160. I‚Äôve only ever seen a handful over 1000. Surely it‚Äôll change soon
---
No
---
scorchbeasts are just a lot of noise and bluster.. they dont really hit that hard IMO.. all they are is spongey
---
Currency needs to be applicable to more than one exchange. If you can only exchange the currency at one place for one limited list of items, it's no more currency than those tickets they used to give at Arcades that you could trade for stupid prizes.
---
soon as it ended i found the whole treasure hunter wayward quest pointless , should have had opportunity to go back to those legendary vending machines in some form of endgame content.
---
I think a lot of progress would be made if they re-evaluated their priorities as far as what needs to be added and changed when.
---
Perk loadouts being pushed back to a few seasons from now, whereas legendary perks that still need some time to cook are coming out before then, is an example. I feel like there is a lot going on behind the scenes that is affecting all this, besides the obvious factor that they are still working from home (I believe?), so I'm willing to cut them some slack as long as we just get some forward momentum going.
---
So you enjoy dupes to get outfits which can fetch upwards of 30k caps, but not the weapons dupes.  Sounds like you‚Äôre a hypocrite.
---
You can craft it instead dude
---
I just figured it‚Äôs mislabeled as a Daily when it should be labeled as Repeatable.
---
I went to the one near AMS in Watoga. Had 3 on it first try.
---
This game is really easy.  That being said, i wonder if there's some sort of bug with the scorchbeast sonic attack.  A few times now I've been standing still in PA and let it hit me and i take 0 dmg.  Not even 1 point.  Something could be off.
---
Thank you. Autocorrect does not seem to like the idea that vats is a word. Even though it‚Äôs not even unique to Fallout.
---
I‚Äôll take your garbage, sir.
---
I would like a legacy thatd be nice lmao
---
It sure will since I posted it to the forums as well. Whether they'll listen or not for the hundredth post with the same issues pointed out, that I don't know...
---
God yes. Even just stopping it flashing would be a huge improvement.
---
I start laughing as soon as I launch the game, seeing how pathetic it all is.
---
9 is excessive. 3 you can usually find in one or two matches, 9 is a major time investment. Unless you‚Äôre playing NW anyway, I‚Äôd skip that one and just grind some XP.
---
Haven't laughed yet,. mostly just said wow &amp; thought about what made it crash lol.
---
It seems like my game crashes more,when almost the whole lobby is doing an event with me &amp; there's a lot of enemies involved or friendly NPCs.
---
It'll still crash randomly of course, just every other day.
---
gone but never forgotten
---
For me, it seems that once the last few circles come up the creatures are everywhere especially towards the edges of the circle.
---
&gt; *‚ÄùSpecially if it‚Äôs something like dark souls‚Äù*
---
Imagine not channeling your rage into a heightened state of focus and hyper-reactivity.
---
Lack of a team is exactly the reason I never did vault raids.  Having a raid like that with no easy way to find a team  is the height of stupidity.  So yes, I  think this is a great idea.
---
A bug like that wouldn't surpirse me. Thanks for answering.
---
[I made this.](https://i.imgur.com/3FEUnoD.jpg)
---
I have I m going over to the 76market sub right now to do my weekly post lol, yes I did dodge my family again idc I need more junk
---
Okay that explains it, thanks for answering
---
yes Mr Correct
---
Indeed, the memorial is being made
---
Here‚Äôs one other thing that‚Äôs screwed up - a challenge recently showed up (not a score one) that wants you to complete all dailies, including the non-repeatable mistaken identity, and if you did the quest with them all before this like I did, you can‚Äôt earn those 80 atoms.
---
...okay? Yes, they would need every round to be worth at least 1 point, and would need to adjust prices accordingly... which.. is easy. Were this FO4 or Skyrim, I could do it myself using xEdit, probably in no more than an hour or two (and half of that time would be just because I'm out of practice).
---
Which you can only do if you have a chassis.
---
Yikes I know right lol
---
Note to self: stock vending machines with more ammo types.
---
Couple leveling tips (while soloing, as I play). 
---
Always rest and get tuned before adventure, bump your intelligence up before battle, pop some XP boosting edibles, and just smash shit. I'm level 100 or so and I just run around killing things. Barely even do quests unless I'm near one. I seem to get a level a session and I only play for a couple/few hours.
---
Realistically?  They probably would have set it up like that anyway because every decision they make is based around extending the grind.
---
The fireproof perk neuters them completely, as their attacks are considered to be explosive damage. Even just the level 1 version of this perk makes them a non threat.
---
They are mostly annoying because while they only have moderately high resistances and health, they take ages to kill because while they are flying around you end up losing almost all of your damage to range weapon fall off, and they just hover there plinking away being more loud and annoying than any actual threat. When they land or get close enough they die super easily though.
---
np best of luck out there.
---
Last night I couldn't find a container to unlock at all, but I killed three creatures in one battle and said to myself, "I bet tomorrow the challenge is to kill some creatures..."
---
Timer with lagging  server makes an event like that impossible to even complete.
---
I get the impression that Bethesda has only one mode of problem solving:
---
- Gamedesigner A: "How do we implement XYZ?"
---
- Gamedesigner B: "I know, we'll make them GRIND for it!" 
---
- ...and then everyone pats each others backs...
---
Sounds promising, but I can‚Äôt get too excited about datamined ATX items anymore. Some of the ones that were datamined a year ago still haven‚Äôt appeared.
---
good idea but the result would most likely be :
---
"i rerolled one weekly and all my other challenges auto-completed by themselves and i did not got the score points. is that only me ? is beth can give me back my points ??"
---
i mean NW and the adventure mode are 2 different games, apples and bananas.
---
Once again, you are trying to sit in your ivory tower and justify exploiting in the game, and ignoring that it‚Äôs not the most effective farming method.
---
The downvotes you receive is proof enough most people think your suggestion is BS.  If
---
Can chimes are my favorite for sure. A touch of XP to disarm, and a fair amount of lead and steel.
---
I sell plans for ultracite power armor mods on PC for reasonable prices, like 25 caps apiece usually. 
---
Im on PC and my player name is the same as my reddit name.
---
3 points in inspiration usually.
---
Well I meant , look at eso there were and probably are still bugs but it works as intended and advertised. I just seen an advertisement for the wendigo colossus now imagine I bought the game just to fight a monster /do an event that‚Äôs currently broken AND not in game
---
Everyone participate in this event is cheaters then, ur argument is same as ur profile‚Äôs pronunciation
---
The simplest way to do it imo would he how it was originally said, every 50 ranks you get another legendary perk, this could be you either choosing a new one or ranking 1 up.  
---
Should be simple.  
---
It will in theory be easier to keep starting new characters to rank them up to level 50 instead of using the high level character you already have, but that would involve a lot of dedication to that character to the point where most people wouldnt want to delete it afterwards
---
Found pieces at Camden Park
---
Lol yea like a clown nose
---
Ok, so the post did get some traction once again, I guess it's time to call these people: u/Ladydevann  [u/Valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/Valseek/)  [u/LoneVaultWanderer](https://www.reddit.com/u/LoneVaultWanderer/)
---
 I have a Bloodied and Furious, both with FFR Gatling Plasma. I use one for each of my characters. I do like 50-70 a hit on average when she lands.
---
"It just works!"
---
So, if you already had them from the previous NW events this unexpected drop won't give anything new?
---
To me this is the worst NW challenge; plus 9 should be a weekly rather than daily in my opinion.
---
I haven't crashed in a few days but one thing that is back after patch 20 is that closing the game just crashes it in place and it never gracefully closes and leaves its window open until I kill it with Task Manager. I quit fo76 and then launched Beatsaber without realizing this had occurred and was livid cause my system was laggy and I didn't realize why until I was done with Beatsaber, but fo76 failed to gracefully exit and was stuck on "not responding" with the entire game window and executable using 20% of my memory doing literally nothing. 
---
When I saw the dead window after I closed beatsaber I chuckled cause I couldnt even be mad.
---
They are but I mean if the game were on schedule and we had mods those suggestions would be realities
---
not to mention how that would wreck the xb market
---
From what ive read, that is the intent down the road, but they are completely revamping them, so they are challenging and engaging, and the rewards arent.....garbage.
---
with all the latest updates, and if this is true, I have fairly high hopes for them
---
Making any benefit from number of levels is messy and will cause the player to have to do things they normally would not do otherwise.  It would make you not want to play your high level characters... make new characters and stop playing them once they hit a certain level.  This is not fun.
---
D3 is a great example, they already figured all this stuff out.  It should be EXP based, you should get 1 pool of legendary exp that is accumulated across all characters.  This way every legendary level can scale logically.... and lower level alts will not gain legendary levels at a faster rate than your 300+ main.
---
Yeah while they are in the air I try using my gatling gun and when they land I use my TS .50 LMG so I won't lose too many ammo because I mis while they are airborne
---
*Scotland intensifies*
---
I got the plan for 599 a couple of hours ago.
---
I‚Äôve been in since the beta days, and recently started a new character. When I took him through basic training at Camp McClintock, the game crashed after a few of the tests, leaving him naked and having to start over from the beginning... just like happened to my first two characters, back in the day.
---
Yeah, I laughed. Not as hard as I was laughing the other day during Line in the Sand when we had a naked, headless and unkillable scorched lurking on the raised walkway, and all of the scorched would spawn in as a group a few feet off the ground right in front of the sonic emitter. Gang of scorched materializes, falls to the ground, gets mowed down because we‚Äôre all right there waiting for them. For every frustrating bug, there‚Äôs a helpful or hilarious one, that‚Äôs the Bethesda way.
---
My sloth is called Ben and I have signposted on the side of my house ‚Äòplease leave Ben alone he‚Äôs sensitive‚Äô
---
Yes I do the same thing!Also I notice that that only happens to me when I have stable flux on my character it‚Äôs annoying af and I despise this particular bug
---
I'm in a community server and mine is not showing none of them are its happening on both private and community its really annoying im ganna put my camp next to it so I have the fast travel near
---
Just like the ammo press in The Pitt, except that one you could add steel (or items that contained steel anyway) as well.
---
Unless they say otherwise, Atom shop skins generally work for all power armor types.
---
I've been incredibly lucky and in my 150hrs in the game so far I've only had 2 crashes that where when I was wandering around and no bugs that I can remember. Except 1 time no players bodies would load in. Everyone was floating heads.
---
I think I‚Äôve only experienced 2-3 crashes/freezes after playing for about 50 hours. I‚Äôve had much less issues with this than I have FO4.
---
There's bits in Garrahan Mining HQ it the room with all PA workstations in. Or just craft some.
---
It doesn't. Level 1 immediately gives you +3 to both lockpicking and hacking. The higher ranks just raise the level of lock it will auto-open (i.e. no mini-game).
---
If you hide long enough and make it to the final combatants or top 20 i think. they usually spawn a dog or crab right near you to get you out of hiding. At least this has been my experience.
---
Hairy queen fights sounds like a porno name.
---
Yes, I was online and playing. Wow. It's absurd that doing so is a problem.
---
Love Ben with everything you have and never let anything happen to him. For me
---
I actually enjoy NW, and I despise the NW S.C.O.R.E. challenges. When I am playing it to complete those damn challenges, I am playing it in a way that it was never meant to be played.  For the "level up in NW challenge," I just start a new character. Going from level 0 to level one takes about 20 minutes of hiding in bushes.   It's easy, but not fun at all and not how I wish to play the mode.
---
I fight better when im relaxed.
---
time to buy up all those cap a piece bullets
---
Correct
---
I always stock gunpowder in my machines.  Doesn‚Äôt move that often though, but then someone comes by and buys it all.  
---
The ammo converter works decently with .44 and other non used ammo types = best way to convert for 5.56 ammo.  As others said, crafting for .50 with super and extra ammo perks is useful. 
---
If anything else just run around areas with super mutants or scorched to collect .38 and shotgun ammo
---
Another option is build a camp on a lead resource node üëç
---
Well tbh the sonic attacks never damages me...even out of PA...
---
hey dont back down you are superior to all of us arnt you? We are all low intelligence wastelanders? Why the change of tone?
---
Curious: why are people downvoting for pointing out a bug and giving evidence? You would think the community would support that.
---
I have my survival tent plopped in the spot to make the scorched all spawn in a group, basically on top of the sonic generator...if everyone has AoE weapons or tesla cannons, the scorched all day in a big pile and almost instantly.  
---
Just a big pile of guts, weapons, ammo, and the occasional pleasant valley claim ticket.
---
What's ignorant?  Saying I've never personally had an issue?
---
The worst isn‚Äôt that it just crashes out silently, no it has to be a whole annoying LOUD NOISES!
---
*ERRROIIRRERYOOOITREEREDFYIOOOIIIIIEEEEEEEE!!!*
---
What's broken about the quest?
---
I meant PVP should be limited to the NW versions of guns/armor for damage calculation because they got a complete rebalancing for PVP (although this will pose problems because it's no 1:1 relation and e.g. armors in NW are always a pack and not individual pieces etc.). That includes making them non-legendary - or are there legendary guns in NW?
---
But perks/mutations also will be a *great* problem, because frog legs and one-shotting bloodied builds...
---
I thought this was supposed to be a feature to scrap cards we didn't like or is the legendary rework happening only in terms of how we earn legendary perk cards? I would still like a feature to scrap cards I find useless instead of having to integrate another mechanic into my gameplay due to the in game meta being fundamentally changed again. I mean I guess I also thought the ammo converter was going to be function like the ammo work bench from FONV so I think I'm out of the loop with what the community wants.
---
Appreciate the offer.  I sell them too pretty much all for 15 caps, the armor piece plans I drop at train stations in suitcases for low level players to find. I have way too many plans from doing so many queen runs but still no calibrated shock plans.  If you happen to have that plan and for 25 caps then I'mma be right there lol.  Pretty sure its the only ultracite mod I don't know at this point.  My RNG on that one has not been good.
---
I think bloodied builds are fine.  Unyielding however needs to be toned down.  Any other armor is pretty useless in comparison
---
Go to Garranan mining hq and there's usually loads of t45 bits lay around the PA station room.
---
Absolutely
---
Craft it. I mean bam! Or do you not know a single plan for crafting any power armor?
---
I'm here to kick ass and chew bubblegum... and i got 40lbs of bubblegum so please *don't force me to kick ass!*
---
If you leave your team right away after completing the challenge, just turn squad fill off, that way you don't affect any teammates
---
I've made several posts about the issues with the gauss rifle
---
we'll have to mod them IRL too.
---
Thanks all - I am a generic bloodied build now so interested to try something new.
---
...I'm not sure if I've even learned the calibrated shocks plan!  I'll have to check tonight, but I know I don't have it for sale.
---
At least it's nowhere near as bad as it was at launch. It went from several disconnects in any given day to, maybe one every 2 to 3 days? I generally play 2 to 4 hours a day during the week, and as much as I can on  the weekends. Back at launch you were lucky to get through an hour of gaming without a game crash or disconnect. They have come a long way, but there is still pleanty to fix.
---
For low level teams generic dmg perks a fine like bloody mess or tenderizer. For high level teams utility perks like inspirational or through hiker. Magnetic personality also affects quest rewards.
---
Move speed caps at 20% so if your mates have speed demon it won't go any higher.
---
Yep because this game loves to crash none stop
---
Thank you very much for this kind offer. I will start nuking some places to harvest flux and get back to you.
---
So is your grammar
---
Getting the same error tried opening ports on router, white listing to no avail.
---
Man fallout 76 building so soooo weird. On one hand you can't build most common/simple things. But on the other hand people can build flying fortresses suspended by 1 stair. And on the 3rd hand if you know the right build order or cheeky technique you can build some pretty gnarly stuff.
---
Like i've tried so many different solution to stack those stairs, even tried the column trick- just never tried "two columns" lol.
---
Thanks for the share OP, and thanks for the quick vid and not drawing it out.
---
Thank you very much for this kind offer. I will start nuking some places to harvest flux and get back to you when I have enough.
---
Heh. "Balance." A full suit of regular armor can have up to 15 legendary effects vs. 6 mods (not counting headlamp) for a suit of power armor, a significant portion of which are useless. But at least they're not giving regular armor even MORE advantages. Well... Except for poison protection. -_-
---
I meant it for the easier to get like quest outfits not the .001% event ones, the ones I scraped like an idiot lol and to be fair outfit dupes don‚Äôt hurt the game and economy as much as weapon/ armor
---
English isn't everyones first language dude 
---
let the guy bang he mad.
---
No, survival was a separate server with a bunch of extra shit like scoreboards that promoted people abusing overpowered legendaries and spawn camping people.
---
Just add this shit to adventure mode. There is literally no reason to have a SEPARATE pvp server when you could just have opt-in pvp on the same server.
---
Thanks, everyone! This is all great information.
---
Yeah. That is where I went in the end.
---
Sucks this is a challenge newbies can't do, though.
---
Theyre Skins. You need to apply them to pre-existing weapons and armor
---
It gave me a chuckle, which is good enough for me.
---
And yea, vats has been crap everywhere, not just at that event
---
Sounds like the early days of fighting the queen where almost every fight crashed the server. You got a completion like 1 out of 6 or so tries. Lol
---
Lol no. That second bit dismissing bugs as something that only grinding players notice, and the assertion that everything is fine otherwise, is what's ignorant. As fuck.
---
I'm happy you've had a nice experience. That doesn't change the fact that there are fundamental, game breaking issues that need to be addressed, and your nonchalant attitude because of your anecdotal experience is only hurting the community trying to be heard and get them fixed.
---
Im not defending it im just speculating.
---
Only in NW.
---
hAvInG a GoOd OnE, i HoPe
---
Agreed it should function like in fallout 4
---
Wow. Never knew that about Bloody and just assumed it maxed at 20% health with nerd rage.  I should put down the sticks and actually look at a builds guide someday.
---
craft it. or go the tunnel entrance for the riding shotgun event, always one piece of armor on the ground there.
---
It's kind of insane how big of a performance increase there is just by turning off grass and the built in v-sync. Fallout 76 performed worse than any other game I've played in the last 5 years and after those small changes to the custom ini AngryTurtle outlined, it is now smooth as butter and performing how I'd expect (a.k.a. I have to manually limit the frame rate to 60 because I easily get in excess of 120 FPS).
---
The fact that you have to do this in a custom ini and it wasn't optimized out of the box is so frustrating.
---
I‚Äôve seen some crazy builds like  flying UFO‚Äôs. Takes a lot of patience as if you get one thing wrong you more than likely have to start Over. Glad it will help and thanks üëç
---
hunter/hunted is a specific minigame where you get given a target to kill
---
This would literally just be a permament pvp with everyone option you'd turn on in the menu. Warmode in WoW.
---
i'm a huge idiot, i thought it was next week and i had like 800 scrip, so i went there to spend it and now i realize it was today and i'm left with like 40 scrip...
---
Oooooooooh. Thank you
---
I don't normally have an issue specifically with Radiation Rumble. I use my AA 50% limb dam fancy shotgun and damn near one shot everything.  I have had the VATS not activating but it happens other places also.
---
seriously. that's a nw event? i'm that stupid? i fast traveled all over the map massacring every type of creature i could think of. and it's nw....
---
thanks.
---
I did all my effort with NW but you can't even get the bonus NW weekly challenge if it autocompletes upon login.
---
Everything - EVERYTHING - about perks in this game was terrible since launch. 
---
Why the hell did they put cards in anyway? Why random drops, why duplicates, why any of that dumb crap?
---
I stopped playing long ago and really want to start again... but I want real private servers (not renting theirs!!) so I can have mods that remove the entire shitty perk system. 
---
Fuck, I hate that they barely even put the B-team on FO76.
---
it would be a waiting game, you need to get in, find a weapon, then hide out till they start spawning more towards the middle of the match.  
---
For me, not with the effort.  I‚Äôm just going to farm Xp in adventure mode in the same time frame.
---
Exploding perks seen kinda dumb/useless, chance for enemies to explode when kill with explosives? Lol
---
Yes in reality I agree with you this post was honestly a grown man in his feels but my community has since lifted my spirits back up! I‚Äôm trading and collecting junk again like the good little collection
---
However my post are still in upvote, downvote in the comments meant nothing becoz I knew the same 2 or 3 ppl juz downvoting anything I wrote. Oh I know the best XP farming method by nuking somewhere but it is little boring. I m done here, good night n have a nice day
---
What were you doing before this happened?
---
It‚Äôs a shame, the tr@ding subreddit is going mad and rightfully so.
---
the Secret Service should also have a daily quest. talk about not using a faction
---
Back in the early days, when legendaries were far rarer and none of us really knew what we were doing, I was part of a SBQ fight that went completely bust.  
---
It went to time despite our best efforts, people were dying left and right, three of my guns broke and it got to the point I was just trying to punch her to death.  
---
It was great!
---
Fuck nuclear winter, worst pvp mode i ever played in a video game, i rather play original unreal DM.
---
Yes it's broke :(  Pls fix Bethesda
---
Inspirational
---
you only have 1 toon?
---
Why not remove all RNG elements from perks and give you all of the cards?
---
it's only on the test server its not actually out yet.
---
Is my best weapon and not broken, my Bloodied Handmade.
---
Please don't Bethesda shut the servers.
---
I actually really enjoy Nuclear Winter. Great way to kill some free time especially if you don‚Äôt feel like doing dailies or events at the moment. You‚Äôre not being forced to play for Score. Just wait for double score events, those will more than make up for the lack of points at the moment.
---
Well all the duping getting done today will give the problems to everyone. So there is that.
---
my others are overweight mules.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry yourself, the guy got triggered you can‚Äôt think when that happens.
---
Truer words never spoken
---
It's extremely disappointing that none of the bow skins work for the compound bow, considering it's the upgrade that does noticeably more damage. 
---
The fletcher skin is **especially** disappointing because it's *LITERALLY* a fuckin compound bow. How do you mess that up?!
---
Wow that‚Äôs an eye opener so why then or where rather is the hang up? Is it the devs or is it the suits?
---
I suspect they refused to listen to the plethora of suggestions from the community to ditch the terminal because Bethesda is hoping the terminal menu itself will help stop any dupe methods. 
---
Disappointing indeed.
---
I think we‚Äôre on to something.
---
It‚Äôs something I never payed attention to or really even knew about until public teams.  Now I always go for higher level teams as they are more likely to each have a perk shared. 
---
I think any perk that passively helps is useful.  Most people won‚Äôt have 6+ points in CH though.  
---
Obviously inspire for the XP %.   Adrenaline is a decent one.  Bloody mess Movement speed one is good.  Weight reduction perks in strength are a nice QoL perk to have in general and I believe they stack.
---
You can't go over 15, even with the legendary perks. So most characters will use them to shore up their secondary stats, since they'll likely have already maxed the primary ones for their build.
---
Or just don't do it since you don't need it to complete the 5/5?  NW can be a lot of fun if you aren't bad.
---
Yiikkkkkkees anything but my legacy weapons I m ok with the x-01 just not my babies
---
I can't login to the game right now. Do you mind writing what today's challenges are?
---
sounds annoying :(
---
i have like 40 points left with lvl 340 because of switching and testing stuff, and also because of switching to 15int for season.
---
I like stranger in numbers as it stacks, but I don't use marsupial so I see no down side.
---
üèÖ
---
Well, they do not if your SPECIAL is already at 15, though. Keep that in mind, because it's a very limiting factor.
---
cash in their perk cards too..
---
Yeah Secret Service and Wayward are sadly not that interesting... honestly for all the people in Crater and Foundation they could use more stuff to do too.
---
Lol yea someone just educated me on how I mistook one team for another sorry I‚Äôll edit
---
Project paradise do this to me 90% of the time.
---
Been playing since beta, can confirm this is my reaction every time. Last night I crashed to desktop three times just trying to load into a world. Was laughing the entire time.
---
The game doesn't need to crash for it to get laughed at. 
---
But we love it and somehow its strangely addictive.
---
Its not called English bruh, its called American.  Its they're responsibility to git it right.  It ain't my job to learn them.  Sorry if thats harsh but I had to go their.
---
Of course you‚Äôre done.  You hadn‚Äôt even started.  You had no real argument and never were able to counter any of the arguments anyone made like:
---
* the purpose of the event is to complete it, not farm XP
---
* there are better ways to farm XP (and no, it‚Äôs not nuking unless you exploit server hoping on the same server)
---
* The fact that you are trying to glitch an event and are getting mad that people aren‚Äôt glitching the way you want them too.
---
Maybe if you had actually had an argument and countered the points people made it would have gotten somewhere
---
I find spawning in an area on the border of the map that doesn't have buildings to be a bit helpful. There always seems to be a few more in those areas and it gives you a large area of the map to work into to find more. Like for Flatwoods, the stretch of map between the haunted cabins and Flatwoods usually has quite a few creatures to kill.
---
Thanks! -))
---
Why not? They can just check places like Aaronholt.
---
The bloodied build is balanced as I die a lot compared to my friends. It's reminiscent of survival mode in FO4. Easy to kill and get killed. There is no real down side in 76 if your good at stashing your junk.
---
Right like what will happen to fo76 in regards to the next gen consoles?
---
It‚Äôs 100% intentional. Only way they‚Äôll change it is if a big enough stink is made about it
---
are perk points shared across the whole account?
---
I decided to do a single 'line in the sand' and get 200 SCORE rather than sit through all that.
---
You can get a hell of a lot of caps for that one.  Low end estimate for number of Scorched Earth's I've done since picking the game up almost exactly a year ago is 300 at this point.  Still haven't gotten it to drop.
---
And then even if I get it, it will just be a completionist thing at this point.  Kind of digging my new t51/t65 combination.
---
Precisely
---
Last night I got disconnected during the event at Winding Path, the one with all the ghouls. The game keeps trying to load me back into the same disconnected server. After quitting to the desktop, it finally puts me into a working server and I got lucky that same event was at the same point on that new server so I got to complete it. I knew it was a different server because of the new group of people I saw at it. Instead of one guy melting all the ghouls with his machine gun, it was one guy shooting at the legs with his shotgun. I knew why he was shooting only at the legs but I didn't care. I was there for the xp as I can take out lvl 62 charred ghouls in three headshots. I leveled up and gained two ranks on the board at that event.
---
Complete 1 daily
---
Kill 10 super mutants
---
level up
---
craft scrap power armor
---
9 creature kills in NW
---
I am sure there is another one, but can't remember it.
---
It really seems so sometimes, yeah...
---
what do you mean you "picked the wrong faction?"
---
Isn't there always a PA in the prison yard?
---
*there
---
Ok Mr Correct
---
or buy cheap guns...
---
It happens to me in other places. This just happens to be the worst by my estimate.
---
So they want us to grind to level 3k+ with zero new content? All this does is make me want to insta quit instead.
---
You can always get a mining helmet and change the headlamp color. There are something like 6 options (red, blue, purple, normal white, extra bright white, plus one that projects a vault boy logo). I carry one of each type just to mix it up from time to time. Since they are cosmetics they don‚Äôt weigh anything, and when you put one on it will replace the pip boy light when you turn it on.
---
At least gives you some interesting options other than green.
---
so far, they seem to be welcoming the wave of B2525 fixers lol
---
Mine is when I see  3 star legendary and server crashes...
---
I mean you can already spawn them in by claiming workshops. What‚Äôs the harm of having one available at your camp ?
---
&gt; UPCOMING AMMO CONVERTER IMPROVEMENTS  
---
&gt;We‚Äôve been reading community feedback about the Ammo Converter after we released it as a rank-up reward in The Legendary Run. We‚Äôre pleased to let you know that we are planning to bring improvements to it in our next major patch.  
---
&gt;The Ammo Converter was originally intended to help you exchange the ammo you looted during a play session for your preferred ammo type. When the Ammo Converter launched with the start of Season 1, however, we saw that it wasn‚Äôt meeting the needs of our late-game players. Many of them had thousands of rounds of ammunition banked, and exchanging it for something else became a slow and tedious process. We are looking to make the following changes to help smooth out the experience of getting the ammo you need from the Converter:  
---
&gt;More Ammo Per Exchange:¬†We‚Äôre adding options to buy and sell 10x and 100x the normal amounts of ammo so that you can exchange larger stacks more quickly.  
---
&gt;Fewer Button Presses:¬†Buying and selling is being incorporated directly into the terminal page for each ammo type, which means there will be one less screen for you to click through when exchanging your ammo. Combined with the increased exchange amounts above, you will be able to convert more ammo with less flipping through terminal menus.  
---
&gt;Increased AmmoPoints Cap:¬†You will be able to save up many more AmmoPoints for a rainy day, because we‚Äôre increasing the maximum amount you can store from 2,000 to 100,000.  
---
&gt;We hope these adjustments will help those of you with lots of ammo in storage to swap it more effectively once our next update arrives.
---
I don't get why the terminal is necessary at all. Couldn't they give it the same UI as every other vendor and exchange machine in Appalachia?
---
they will never shut the servers down for something like this.
---
most likely, they will disable vending again. again.
---
so now it takes 500 clicks to convert 100,000 rounds of .38 at 1000 per convert instead of 6,000 clicks to convert 100,000 rounds of .38 at 100 per convert
---
If ya want lol I don‚Äôt just because I don‚Äôt like being top tier gear wise haha I prefer some challenge
---
What level is the Ghilli suit?
---
He probably meant to take pictures for the faction he wanted to get rep for, but chose the wrong one
---
You know what they says. If its broken dont fix it... Oh wait...
---
Unyielding could work more like the life saving or auto stim armor. If you drop below X% health you gain the stat boost for a certain amount of time with a cooldown to prevent it being up 100%. Would still make it useful but within a specific window of time.
---
Daily quests, it started when I went to Morgan town station to stash items
---
I did the same thing a while back, tried server hopping but he didn't have it again
---
T-65 should be able to use any model-swap skins. All power armor can, because they don't have to be tailored to the specific armor models like standard paintjobs.
---
I have no idea how many queen kills I've been to, but Ibhave a feeling I don't know that plan.
---
I was really confused when I was done at the Wayward and there was nothing left there anymore. We get to know and help out all these character and when it's at its peak it all just ends? At least give us a daily there!
---
You can choose whether to get intel on the crater or foundation, then turn in the photos to the opposite faction to gain rep with them. I was spamming x and picked crater but I don't need settler rep
---
Having those equipped is going to be meta 100%. I can easily see every "meta" build calling for Str, Agi, Per, and Lck. Then probably having the damage decrease one for the same armor type.
---
What do you mean by dismissing it?
---
You can complete the mission by handing the photos to Davenport or the opposing faction and then telling Davenport you sold them OR you can lie if you have 8+CHA, and no matter how did you do it, it will refresh the next day.
---
It runs silky smooth at 120 FPS for me on an ultrawide at MAX settings. Strange...
---
Train yard always seems to have a few creatures...
---
That sucks but thx for confirming
---
Thank God they listened to the endless duplicate posting on this sub about the ammo converter!  Who needs Perk cards that actually work, right?
---
&gt; Takes a lot of patience as if you get one thing wrong you more than likely have to start Over.
---
Yeah i've made the mistake of plopping down a stair and then not being able to remove it for whatever reason. Only solution i found was to just move and scrap the entire camp lol
---
I actually kind of miss the days of a genuinely fierce queen battle.
---
More often than not when the nuke goes off over her these days within minutes the whole area is covered in survival tents placed 50ft off the ground and super high level people in very cool power armour cutting her to shreds within minutes.
---
Hmm. I didn't think the cards were swinging it that far, but I suppose if he's very high level he can really stack the deck to a certain weapon.
---
Well I never have trouble playing to the sneaky method...had a pair of players run through the bush I was hiding in and never even noticed me. I don't think the game is all that great as I think it's poorly balanced for a FPS style game, but the joy is I don't have to play it except to try and reach certain rewards...it would just be nice if they could be available in other ways.
---
Probably why they added in the ammo convertor + the new legendary perk card ammo system.
---
I mean with the legendary perk you'll be able to craft what, 200-300% more ammo not counting super duper.
---
oh okay, so you're just saying that you picked the wrong place and you cant repick, not that the quest isn't completable?
---
Would there be baby oil and merkins?
---
Already quit. Bought the whole year in fo1st a month or two ago, but I‚Äôm not coming back unless they add pvp back to adventure
---
Only 50k more West Tek runs to go.
---
They really need to add more landmass/content if they want us to grind this.
---
One could hope that they cap the XP required for levels when they add "one wasteland", or increase the amount XP you earn from enemies when you level up.
---
I was going to reply to the negative on that one, but then realized that literally nobody I know cares about the purveyor discount because it doesn't apply to legendary modules or vault steel. Even though we all complained about how garbage the mystery pick was and that the discount would at least be worth something
---
I don't know if you can call what I do selling.  Its mostly just inventory management.
---
Plans = 0caps. No sense cluttering my inventory and vendors with plans no one needs or wants.  Since I list them all for free people regularly get any they don't know and the occasional plans merchant will clear me out.  I usually have no more than 20 plans at a time.
---
Junk = 1 or 0caps.  I don't bulk.  At the end of the day, I list all my extra junk (anything over 200per except lead and steel). All the sought after junk moves quick at 1c and things like bone, glass, leather, wood find a good home at 0.
---
Ammo = 1c/per I only sell .308, .45, 5.56.  These sell even if I have less than 100.  everything else that I don't use goes into the converter or gets dropped.
---
Clothing = 0caps.  Cant have a bunch of naked wastelanders, can we?
---
Magazines/Bobbleheads = 100caps. They sell well and it seems a decent price for anyone looking to fill their displays.  Anytime I see one for sell for under 100 I pick it up and put it in my shop just to keep a larger inventory for display hunters.
---
Super Stims = 25caps. They fly off the shelf at that price.
---
Serums = 300caps.  I might drop this down to 250.  People get what they want.  Price really doesn't seem to be an issue.  I mostly just sell my 2-3 a day to vendors for 430 caps apiece.
---
Legendarys for scrip = 0caps.  I don't care about the 1 and 2 stars once I hit my scrip limit for the day so I list these for free just to clear the stash.
---
Food = 0caps.  I run Butchers Bounty, Good with Salt, and Thru Hiker.  I am always flush with food.  I usually sell my extras to the vendors to finish up whatever caps they have, after that I just don't want anyone to go hungry.
---
The free shop really helps keep my weight down and its kind of satisfying to see a low level at my camp leave with a bonanza of goods.
---
Well now that today's new dupe is public, I would say never.
---
The crappy thing is this contributes to the weekly complete 3 nw challenges. I can only avoid so many before I'm out 1000 score.
---
They wonder why almost everyone duped now
---
If something is broken - fix a light bulb and wait
---
Half the time you don't even have to be in a bush. I've had people walk right past me out in the open. 
---
https://youtu.be/ynI_Du1l4ME
---
The global NW challenges count for that as well i believe so maybe take a look at those?
---
I'll just copy/paste my comment from the other thread because it fits even better here...
---
Agree.   Especially when people butch about it taking 10 min or the exact amount of ammo they wasted.
---
That is pretty inaccurate for PS4.
---
But does this fix the conversion rate? Sure I can do the process faster but if the conversion rate is still the same, it's still a garbage system. 10k of 5mm currently converts into 522 of .45. That is insulting an unacceptable. I know it'll never be a 1:1 conversion but even a 2:1 or 3:1 would be nice. But now seeing that the Legendary Perk Card of Ammo Factory is coming, that's where they're hoping for you to make up the difference in conjunction with the Raiders Ammo Machine. Maybe I can finally stop buying ammo from players.
---
It happens most right after i power up poseidon so i'm just like "Oh whale, guess I'll get another free 100 caps for 10 minutes of nothingness"
---
One less menu to click through to achieve what you want is an improved UX.
---
Ok ty All guys
---
Also, at level 58 you are basically at endgame. Your stats don‚Äôt increase anymore so it‚Äôs basically optimization and gearing up. I was building for a stealth commando from the beginning and I think I started taking them down around level 30.
---
Agreed, but as a programmer it's the sort of fix you try to see will sate the users before going to the full rework.  A.k.a. Stopgap solution.
---
Just wait for it:   "Ammo Converter v2.0; FREE for F1 members\~
---
?
---
You're one of the lucky few then. As someone who's played for 200 hours I've had atleast 50 crashes on a high end device.
---
Don't get me wrong i love tge game but i still grit my teath when i loose progress to it
---
&gt; add pvp back to adventure
---
NW is a bust, there are so many way better pvp games out there, they should have stuck with the second pvp server so we could use our character.
---
There's a shit-ton more than *there* in my post that is gramatically incorrect.  I guess people either didn't get the subtle sarcasm or just think I'm not very funny.  Oh well.
---
I understand what you are saying.  I am not one that dupes but if the weapon is offered I will take it.  I like rocking my AA 50% limb dam Fancy Shotgun from the Pleasant Valley Tickets.
---
Power armor has hidden damage reduction for each piece as well as reducing explosion damage which is what the scorchbeast screeching is.
---
Imagine playing the game in 2020
---
No need to argue for something that everyone participated in the event know how to do except one or two
---
Oh then u missed something, I thought u d understand more of this game mechanics
---
When u participate this event and see a tent placed at the spot, u know the drill, and when nobody take out AOE, pls dun be jerk
---
Easy and Simple ,not necessary to write long irrelevant BS over event objective
---
I've been wondering this too. thanks for asking.
---
Gah !
---
Yes
---
Care to elaborate what happened?  I see a bunch of posts for b2525 on PS4
---
They all ready started squeezing that in with SS. I'm ok with it, I just want a commando weapon for gold.
---
Add to that magnetic personality and inspirational since charisma boosts quest turn in xp.
---
I get 2.2k just for turning in Heart of the enemy daily with this perks and a building team.
---
Hey, pm me a list of what you need and if I got enough I'll make it.
---
 Maybe I wrote it wrong.  I wasn't dismissing any bugs.  Simply saying that you are more likely to run into said bugs if you are grinding through the legendary run. As you will be doing more daily missions etc where those bugs exist.   I wasn't meaning to sound ignorant at all.
---
That's basically how the Ammo Machine from the Raiders works. Set the type of ammo, wait, collect ammo and done. How can they make that so simple but not this?
---
last time it was player vending, this time npc's shops?
---
What do you mean
---
28, no glitches... just did almost every daily and played a decent amount every day...
---
...So all the sweaty tryhards that are level 700 now will instantly become massively overpowered?
---
I've seen the same and have heard other similar reports of this starting after wastelanders. 
---
I started playing that free weekend we had after the patch dropped so I don't have any prior personal experience before that.
---
But it is funny to see, as an unarmed build I like to think I just scare them to death sometimes ;)
---
Well done!
---
There was a massive dupe where ppl got a ton of b2525 fixers and the "economy" is suffering.
---
The next rework and the one we will likely be stuck with is the ability to enter the amount of ammo we are turning in instead of selecting amounts by group (which is stupid).
---
So my friend who has the game pass, will he be able to get it from Windows 10 store, and play with me who uses Bethesda launcher?
---
In theory "one violent night" is meant to be like that. Tell that to the fools I was doing the event with yesterday, none of them played any instruments and just stood around killing the ghouls, not even defending the poor idiot sat in the corner playing the mouth harp.
---
&gt; Perk Coins, that is an even worse grind than Score, Rep, and Gold Bullion combined.
---
Dude they want us to grind to level 3k+ to fully upgrade the perks LOL im good.
---
Literally at least once a week. Incredibly frustrating and yet you've got to laugh at how unstable the game is even so long after launch
---
If your on ps4 I can mod it for you.
---
On Xbox man
---
They‚Äôre not shutting down the servers because people are meta slaves.
---
Ouch. The ammo converter is just a faster batch of menuing. Where is the simple The Pitt solution from 2009, put unwanted ammo into a bin, click convert all and generate points.
---
Menu out what you want from the points fine but the dump all option should be there already jesus missing the point.
---
Just wait until they add BoS Dollars when they arrive so that you can buy all the new in-game assets that they brought like a black army cot instead of a green one. and the thing is, you can only earn 2 per day via a single convoluted fetch quest, with a cap of 20, and most items will cost 17 BoS Dollars. but don't worry, you will first have to grind 2 months just to be able to even get enough reputation with the BoS to unlock any of the content that players actually want, like the R91 assault rifle, which will cost 22 BoS Dollars due to a bug that will take a month to fix, and other items that should have just been added to the level list. but while you are grinding rep and BoS Dollars, you can spend them on items like a reskinned BoS flag (NOW IN VAULT TEC COLORS!), a BoS dog collar for the dog companion that they were going to add but got scrapped due to change in plans but they still left the item in the game. and by the time any normal person who has a 9-5 and other responsibilities gets to that point where they can get the guns, They will introduce Enclave Medals so that you can finally get some Enclave gear, but only after you grind their faction for Rep!
---
That would make sense, seeing as that is where the exploit is derived from.. though, idk, NPC vending seems to me like a pretty core mechanic of the game.
---
Oh snap, didn't think of that. I'll def check it out!
---
Post this to their forum, too, please... Also increase the suggestion by one coin in every tier along the way... ;-)
---
Ok was your server lagging at all cause normally that‚Äôs what causes it to happen to me. Sorry for the late reply I had something come up. If it‚Äôs still happening I would restart my game that normally fixes it for me when it keeps happening.
---
nice
---
Just don‚Äôt claim it until you finish wastelanders.
---
The downvoting is probably due to the fact that your post topic is happening all the time now.  It has been brought up daily many, many times.  The downvotes are occurring because they think you should have seen it already on the post history.  Don't let it get you down though - not knowing that is not that big of a deal.
---
I added you üòä
---
&gt;Ok so bug prediction,  the converter rework scraps ALL your
---
Legendary items and fucks you in the ass
---
Yep. You‚Äôre actually enjoying my game? Not anymore üòé
---
Scrapping your extra cards takes away a lot of the flexibility benefits of the card system :/
---
Not sure why they went with this vs a small benefit for super levelling...
---
Same issue here
---
I‚Äôve had one in my vendor for awhile.  I think I found it like most of the other mods I come across.  No idea where though, sorry
---
Be a good little vault dweller and buy atoms! 
---
Buy atoms&gt;Rank up&gt;Get scrip&gt;Roll a 3* Fixer from the Purveyor
---
Hurray, it's pay-to-win now!
---
They do! But what doesnt look good is they wanting us to get to level 3000 to complete the grind.
---
Do you still have it by any chance?
---
Please dont make them remove Master Infiltrator. I will uninstall fo76 if they release the Legendary perks without this perk card.
---
Great workaround for a bullshit problem that shouldn't exist in the first place.
---
What hope said be safe and don‚Äôt collect them until you do finish just to be on the safe side
---
My reaction is never a laugh. Ever.
---
Gunpowder? I'll take it
---
The game was rigged from the start üòè
---
True it‚Äôs different for everyone, I have 1 duped weapon a TSE 50 cal but I don‚Äôt like using it because it‚Äôs duped, I prefer my handmades/level action. If you want one good gun for combat if you‚Äôre struggling I understand but it‚Äôs kinda a open ended argument lol
---
More of a sniper build, but I haven't hit 50 yet, so I'm not fully set up. I learned the bow plan so I could keep making better bows; my current is lvl30. Bows work very similar to the ones in skyrim, just without fancy arrows. They've got crossbows too, but I haven't found a single one yet
---
lmfao imagine people still wanting to trade 30 weaps for 1 weap and still not be enough üòÇ
---
Nice!  Best of luck out there.  Get that SCORE!
---
Yes and the quest is gone since I dismissed it, thought I'd be able to pick it up again like in ESO
---
Except it can't make 2mm ammo, otherwise known as the ammo type of the Wastelanders expansion used for 2 (and a pistol) endgame weapons tied to their Bullion and rep grind.
---
Also the reload speed from speed demon only works half the servers i play.
---
What you just said not necessary to write long irrelevant bs outlines this entire post. You still think your right even after multiple people point out to you directly what your problem is yet you dont acknowledge them and go on a completely off topic tangent.
---
Very true mate.
---
But hey, one of the legendary perks allows you to auto-lock pick and hack level 0 locks and counts as + 3 lock pick and hack. it increases the level of Auto hack per level! talk about griding for a basic feature
---
No because anyone that actually understands what it is wont be disappointed.
---
It's only the idiots that think "RADROACHES WILL BE JUST AS HARD AS SCHORCHBEASTS" that aren't happy.
---
Very much looking forward to it.
---
Bobby pins will be the future.
---
&gt;Level scaling is a garbage feature in literally every game it has ever existed in.
---
What a garbage take lmao. It's improved almost every game it exists in. What the fuck is it with this subreddit and having the most braindead takes? It's like you guys don't play any games other than fallout 76.
---
I‚Äôve searched this one up before you can find the mods but I‚Äôve never found the plan for the mod. Try Phoenix in Watoga he may have it. I got mine by scrapping the Gatling plasma.
---
If your dailies are bugged, delete your LOCAL save file. I had it happen on 2 dailies &amp; Bethesda advised me to do that deletion. Worked like a charm. üëç
---
Look at how many currencies warframe has. It doesnt stop.
---
I have sent that by accident, it was supposed to look like it does right now.

Tbh I wish the guys in the lumber mill would be a faction or like a workshop, they have such a fleshed out and massive camp, they have so many buildings a freakin chair with fireworks etc.

Oh no i just think thats how the world of fallout 76 works, when i think of fo76 i dont think of fallout, i think of a wasteland to chill and rage beacuse of the bullshit that happens to me, the crashes, the freezing, horrible fps and horrible textures, but all in all when i see 76 i just think it just an alternate timeline of fallout where the world is a glitch and everything just makes sense even if it doesnt, tell me how when im the FUCKING AIR A DAMN MOTHERFUCKING GHOUL HITS ME, EXPLAIN THAT SHIT TO ME, but its still a game that lets me relax when its reality isnt breaking down faster than i waste my lmg ammo.
---
Wait... this is a problem? I know people have had issues with stuff in their Stash getting scrapped, since the game *apparently* prioritizes that over everything else, but I thought any items in a display case were safe? I've had my camp set up for probably close to two months now, and nothing's changed with my displays...?
---
Nope. You get them, you just can't spend them.
---
Source: I can go to bullion machines and see the 25 bullion currency I have.
---
I did the same
---
I'm still trying to figure out how we have all the fixings of a hillbilly string band except a fiddle. From there, there's a pile of old songs well out of copyright protections that could be added. Also, why do we not have a bluegrass radio station?
---
There is a dupe glitch going on and people are crazy monkeys
---
There‚Äôs supposedly a new weapon and armor dupe so all the good stuff is being duped at the moment.
---
Yah.
---
Find a gun. Point and shoot!
---
I felt similarly overpowered in those circumstances. I still get hammered by too many high-level ghouls, 1 mirelurk king, or 1 assaultron.
---
nobody on this sub has any idea what they're talking about honestly. Can't believe people here can't grasp what level scaling actually does
---
Just up the amount of coins you get from scrapping weithout increasing the cost to buy the legendary perks.
---
There is no endgame though... :(
---
Todd dammit
---
inb4 all xp spots becomes bad instead of getting more good ones.
---
You should still be able to complete it with the faction you picked.. Are you sure that it just isn't marked as inactive?
---
Them not being able to find you is that terrible target acquisition I mentioned 
---
I've had people hide right next to me and not see me somehow 
---
Easy kill every time
---
I have a photo for this, but yes... agreed!
---
&gt; n the end it means you don't really get more powerful as you level up,
---
Yep, RIP the RPG like character progression in this game.
---
I don't think you can do that on PC
---
Firstly, please check to see if you still have it unfinished as a daily (photo opportunity). Sorry, did have to say that. 
---
If you don‚Äôt, the way this corrected for me was to have a camera equipped (literally in my hand) and  camera film on my character
---
I then fast travelled to the overseers house. Bingo, the photo opportunity mission activated. Load in, walk up the track to the house. GL
---
The fact that there's like three unused friendly "factions" (Secret Service, Free Radicals, and Wayward) makes me think they might come up later in development
---
A head cannon would be quite useful, look, point, shoot! I'd buy that for my PA if it was a thing.
---
Joking aside, while I normally cook something briefly for characters, I actually haven't for 76. You've given me something to think about.
---
It varies on the event. SBQ moments before death and crash? SON OF A BI***
---
Prison break. Meh
---
I can't remember last time it happened.
---
I would gladly exchange the NW daily for say Kill a Behemoth. Launch a Nuke for a weekly.
---
Just hope it does not get patched
---
Scrap some gatling plasma. I got mine this way.
---
yeah, now I will drop everything on the ground instead of selling. but at least new players will be happy.
---
Chair with fireworks?
---
People farm the ghouls that come by because you can get a few legendaries from them. The way to get the most out of it is to only use the jukebox.
---
I haven't encountered an assaultron in a while but they were always tough when I was low level, Mirelurk king as well
---
Free radicals! Thank you I forgot their name lol, I would think use wayward for additional settlement daily‚Äôs and radicals for raider daily‚Äôs! I think you should be able to claim their base and use the radicals as a reinforcement, like the vertibot. Say you fire a flare and 3 or 4 radicals help tou
---
Fullscreen Windowed doesn‚Äôt work well with Freesync.
---
FO76 crashed 4-5 times last night for me in less than 2 hours
---
When is a colossal problem releasing?
---
And then I yell; ‚ÄúWHY AM I STILL PLAYING THIS GAME. THEY ARE UNWORTHY CLAIMING MY TIME‚Äù
---
i didn't notice that but, pro tip, if you have 8+ charisma, you can lie to Davenport and claim the full reward
---
I am pretty sure you have to scrap Gatling plasmas to get it. That‚Äôs how I got mine.
---
There are 20% chance to get it if you scrap. 
---
Just checked google.
---
Wife here - I've done that. What happens is I'll have a piece of stupid flooring that I can't replace or move (underwater, out of build area) and so I have to relocate my entire base to get rid of funky pieces. THEN I go to rebuild my base and the first thing that happens is it takes from storage instead of my scrap box - which is where all my scrap is! So the first things to go are my collectibles. That's happened twice. Or I want to move some flooring or anything... as soon as those bears hit my storage, they are as good as gone.
---
It boggles my mind that the game takes from the storage instead of from the scrap box first. BOGGLES MY MIND!!
---
Again...?
---
I hope it is not just a PC only thing... jk.
---
Extensive RR user here. It's auto and always VATS unless you hip fire one shot at very close range. The good thing is that low AP cost and low ammo capacity make it an efficient VATS weapon. AP regens as you reload.
---
They need to go back to the system that Fallout New Vegas uses.
---
I agree I miss being able to have a full out war with my pals in PvP. I wish they would have added a PvP public group which allows full teams to turn red.
---
Yup only like level 40 at this point.
---
Hope not
---
Yeah we need something along the lines of Vault Raids. Remember when survival was gonna have alternating rules that changed the game world? Yeah. 
---
Couldn't we have like weekly faction skirmishes? Raiders v Settlers? 
---
Something repeatable but w enough variables that even if its procedurally generated, itll be different enough.
---
I used the first aid one once early on. I had wandered too far at too low a level following the Overseer's path to Ethan and ran out of Stimpacks. Bankrupted myself buying 2 since I was finding I had to use them so much.
---
Then I realized my error and went to Grafton to level and since then I haven't had less than 20 Stimpacks at any given time just from loot.
---
These are truly the most worthless machines. I'd only sell to them, but can't even do that...
---
The real problem in this story of course is that FO76, as fun as it is, is like an early 2000's MMO. Everyone else has been moving towards content accessible at any level through invisible normalization for some years now.
---
They tell us to do that for everything, it doesn't help!
---
It didnt look good, but I fixed it and did 10 push-ups as a punishment, master!
---
More fun that some tryhard virgin one shotting the queen and you get nothing becaude "not enough damage"
---
Queen fights now are fucking boring.
---
I highly recommend putting in a support ticket. I got a reply really fast with good instructions on what to do (Xbox.) The guy did say I would lose all the pictures I'd taken  but I actually didn't. That simple deletion fixed a whole lot of issues, but specifically 3 dailies that were bugged.
---
It pays in bullion, not treasury notes like with Fasnacht. You‚Äôre safe to collect. You‚Äôll carry bullion like caps and be able to spend it once you finish the Vault 79 raid.
---
Yeh I server hopped but same issue. I just logged off for a bit ima check later.
---
Thank you sm for your help!
---
No offense, but prove it. I see this claim a LOT and then nothing to back it up.
---
For comparison, I have a 2080ti, dedicated nvme boot and game drives, 32gb RAM and an i7-9700k. 100mbs wired connection.
---
I can easily get 144 fps staring at the ground, but just moving around Whitespring station or other non-intensive areas drops me to 75-85. Head out to the edges of the golf course and it plummets to low 30s. And this is turning down max shadow distance well below normal.
---
That was a limited time item that you could only get by buying an e3 bundle, so I don't think that it's coming back anytime soon.
---
Np I wanted to help how I could cause I know the pain of that glitch.
---
Yeap. We've been telling them this over and over and over in the PTS forum, but the devs just don't listen. They seem so completely disconnected from the game, it's starting to feel like they for real, ACTUALLY don't play the game. 
---
[Here's a post I made when the system first came out](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/411775/legendary-perks-feedback-and-discussion/13?language%5B%5D=en) explaining in exhaustive detail why the perk coin system was crazy. [Here's another post](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/412134/feedback-there-bethesda-i-fixed-your-janky-legendary-perk-system-you-re-welcome?language%5B%5D=en) where I proposed an overhaul of the system.
---
And that's just me. There are tons of posters in that forum who have been making excellent suggestions about fixing the legendary perk system, but Bethesda is ignoring them all and stubbornly moving forward with their blindered "Bethesda knows best" attitude.
---
I've sent many support tickets through Bethesda.net and never get a reply.
---
Agreed. They look weird. I collect all things bear outside of the game, and even I think I'll pass.
---
I have to let out a little 'haaaa' every time it does this. I expect the crashes every so often these days. lol
---
There are still a few I have to deal with occasionally. I‚Äôm level 80 but haven‚Äôt finished the main quest, haven‚Äôt launched a nuke of my own. 
---
Other than the threats I mentioned, I mostly die when I‚Äôve run out of the healing item assigned to a quick key. Just happened last night during Encryptid. Got saved twice by other players, but I still died before I could get to the stimpacks I hadn‚Äôt set up on quick key.
---
travel agent, cuz i only got 1 point in charisma
---
I like the intelligence reward myself.
---
Yeah, that's the one that kills me.
---
They are not.
---
It helped me a lot. I had 3 dailies bugged, Queen of the Hunt, that one in Berkeley Springs with the Nanny, and the Foundation one. None of these could be progressed. I deleted my local save as instructed and BAM. I now have all 3 working. So, it does help.
---
I just skip the NW challenges. I‚Äôm doing 6 out of 7 daily ones and weekly ones. Once in a while I‚Äôll hope on NW if it‚Äôs something I could do super easy. 
---
The lock pick one the other day no way but 3 camps or surviving 30 minutes maybe. I enjoyed NW early on but I prefer the relaxing and cooperative stuff in adventure.
---
Yeah - first there was the problem with displays not working for a while, so she lost some that way. Then even once displays were working again, she has moved/rebuilt her camp a few times. I think the last time (or two) the problem was she didn't stick the bears in displays before doing anything else, so the bears ended up getting scrapped during reconstruction.
---
What's annoying (as many others have posted) is she has the Fallout 1st scrapbox. So why in Bethesda's name would the system scrap stash box items before using massive amount of materials she has stored in the scrapbox? 
---
She has given up the collecting until Bethesda offers a better way to keep items. Which means, most likely, she has given up collecting indefinitely.
---
honestly as someone with all the nuclear winter cards I save my packs to open when there is limited release items since duplicate cards are 50-100 NW xp, and give you an overseer ticket to buy perks you want
---
Question. I play using Beth launcher. If my friend gets it through game pass on Windows 10. Does this mean I can play with him?
---
What's that?
---
Yes actually!
---
Dope. Cheers fam
---
My reaction is ‚Äúit just works‚Äù
---
I managed to kill 1 in one match. Not fucking doing that nine times, fuck this.
---
I opt to be a conduit and tank damage so others can play, but I clearly was underprepared for how much I would be soaking up.
---
The circle jerk is real. ‚ÄúwHy DoN‚Äôt YoU jUsT pLaY vAnILlA‚Äù
---
I tried extending the time-to-turnoff but I'm starting to get burn-in on my new flat screen monitor so I'm afraid to completely shut it off.
---
Yea I‚Äôm playing on medium settings snd the past 3 nights my computer has crashed so hard ive needed to do a hard reset by flipping the power switch, has bot happened with any other game just fo76 :(
---
seems to happen under specific circumstances only. like for example if you can‚Äòt place your camp but decide to stay on the server, then you craft something and voila, shit gets scrapped because it‚Äòs currently not technically assigned to a display case. that is just a big, big oversight on bethesda‚Äòs side.
---
and it‚Äôs only $8!
---
Oh yea, everything count at that point, especially junk. There hits a point that you need FO1st to keep hording but not below 50.
---

---
Yeah they‚Äôve got me before with these things, too tempting for me
---
It's a Nuclear Winter limited time reward. At the moment there is no event, but due to a bug, all the previous rewards are unlockable again. Although IMO the SCORE armor ghillie paints are way better than that suit.
---
When i finished the story i used to just cruise around, lovely.
---
Oh ... can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt notice that, thanks friend!
---
Show me those vendors!
---
Oh good idea ty
---
Yeah true ty
---
Simple Google search 'how to delete local save files on steam' - I found it straight away but can't post the link here.
---
Whenever a Bethesda game crashes the nostalgia easily outweighs the anger lmao
---
People in that forum are clowns, who cares about Gold Perk cards. Must be ocd
---
cheers switching to fullscreen fixed it, i should have thought of that earlier
---
You're welcome\~
---
Do you have Amazon aws blocked at your firewall/DNS? I believe they host 76 on Amazon's cloud.  Other then that thought, no clue sorry.
---
Yeah I have no idea what the hell any of this is (newish player here) but uhhhhhhh I have no desire to engage in any of this because of how goddamn absurd it is.
---
Perk coins, perk cards, bullion I apparently need for something, Legendary Scrip but I should be saving it for the junk to make something else instead of getting legendary weapons I've seen, Overseer XP in a mode where people can just nuke you instantly no matter how well/smart you've played, atoms, Fallout 1st premium membership for basic QOL improvements, Settler/Raider influence, caps for normal supplies, SCORE that can disappear/autocomplete for the Legendary Run &amp; let's be honest, probably every season after this despite how many people hate it, etc.
---
I always wondered why this community was so overwhelmingly nice with little griefing compared to a lot of other online titles but now I get it -- it's because everyone is already fighting with all of the buggy in-game systems &amp; Bethesda's total disregard for basic improvements to any of the systems that no one wants to add griefing, pvp bullshittery to the list lol
---
They occasionally drop from scorchbeasts. I got mine from scrapping them. Just throw on super duper and scrapper. Craft a few of the lowest level version and scrap them.
---
Awkward timing, I got 2 bloodied fixers today legitimately. A 1* from Daguerres daily and a 10/25 from Purveyor
---
Done 10 spawns in the airport not a damn creatures there today normally 2 ghoils some radscorpions
---
My alt character was a cop before the war. She accidentally shot a kid prior to the great war, so she will not touch firearms. She‚Äôs handy with a bow and a baseball bat tho.
---
My main, no story for him
---
It‚Äôs NW Survival Challenge 8: 2500xp
---
But you have to do the others prior, so get ready to grind.
---
All the Halloween stuff/Christmas skins are back as well but hidden behind xp locks. It‚Äôs a good bug if you want the glow in the dark skeleton suit
---
Bruh I‚Äôve been hoping vendors like crazy hoping to catch one. Send it my way lol
---
Of course it need to be level based. If you actively try out builds (you know, play the game) you have hurt yourself without knowing it. The fact they think this is acceptable speaks volumes about the management of this game.
---
Maybe they should start paying us for testing this since they can‚Äôt be bothered to pay staff.
---
How about everytime that happens to someone they report it to them right away that way they will be spammed with reports and maybe that will get them to fix it
---
The bad thing is that I went for a couple of weeks getting no interactions from her and only when I got fed up and went to scrap her console did I get a notice about "Quest Failed."  That's when I found out about the extra quests after the "headache ender."  When I rebuilt the console, I was able to get into these quests and was close to finishing the last one . . . until yesterday.
---
A new dupe already???? Duping guns???
---
The Legendary perk changes are awesome!
---
Master infiltrator and Ammo factory are super nice.
---
What Rads = Children of Atom?!
---
I misunderstood and thought you had reached 100 but didn‚Äôt get the trophy! In that case do not worry as it was fine and I certainly haven‚Äôt read of any issues at least on this subreddit since beta.
---
Ahaha that would be a lot of fun!
---
I think having something- even if it's not complex adds another layer to the game.
---
Yeah on the right side it has a big chair fire works and like drums lol
---
You can‚Äôt craft it without a chassis...
---
You need a chassis to craft the pieces onto...
---
I was doing Power Up Poseidon... ugh. Second time doing a Power Up event (wanted the windmill) &amp; now I was doing it entirely on my own. About two thirds through, game crashes. But! I was in a public team so when I relaunched FO76, it gave me the option to play with my team &amp; I found that the event was where I left it albeit the Scorched had respawned lol. I'm surprised even *that* is a thing in this broken game lol
---
Yeah. 1000s of god rolls have been duped
---
Im the same i thought if its going to be noisy i may as well make it as bad as it can be haha
---
You know, that makes sense. But one thing they might have to change is that it drains the fusion core faster because I assume your boosting your walking power with it.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs one of my main spots to check along with the other chassis‚Äô within walking distance from there
---
Pics or it didnt happen
---
Every time I see someone say some stupid abbreviation of an overpowered tryhard legendary I just cringe honestly.
---
LOOKING TO BUY legacy B/25/25/MK3/A86/1716Y4
---
Need a chassis to craft PA pieces
---
No, you can only use them to roll the new plans from the factions and the armor from secret service.
---
You need a power armor chassis to craft PA
---
i have zero knowledge on the technicality‚Äôs of this. but it‚Äôs an always online game anyway just give every legendary weapon a unique ID or tag of some sort? doesn‚Äôt seem too difficult
---
So now that you‚Äôve explained that what you need is a chassis we can better understand.
---
Oh Bethesda you silly boy you oooohooo ohhoo ohoo ‚Äústarts crying‚Äù
---
What's wrong with that? Beats spelling it out
---
Yes. 100%
---
Only Wastelanders Weapons &amp; Armor can be crafted with legendary perks with modules. If you want a good fixer, you‚Äôll have to have learnt the fixer plan, and you‚Äôd either have to buy/trade one of another player or try your luck with the purveyor. I‚Äôd recommend rolling 2* Ranged if you do try your luck.
---
What do you mean roll the new plans? So I can roll a gauss rifle?
---
Proof?  Youtube or otherwise on a current weapon dupe?
---
You still can.
---
Get the codes, get a key card, and clear the silo that your codes match up with There are some really good videos on the Silos
---
There actually pretty easy. The place your camp 3 times one you can do in 1 match and takes like 5-10 minutes to do.
---
You can still launch a nuke, just have to go to the silos and launch one.
---
Ah ok thanks. Is there anyway to get a legendary lever action? Since I know the plan do I just need to pray to the rng gods and take my chances with the purveyor?
---
what if you dont run bloodied?
---
Go to fo76 market people buying them for 2000 caps pics attached
---
Holy crap, and I thought it'd help to upgrade to a 2080 Super from my 5yo 980Ti. Well, I guess all we can do here is to wait for FPS-Fixer mods like people did for FO4. And that would require full modding support, I presume.
---
I usually get about 20-24 fps nearby the golf club. In other places it constantly jumps between 45 and 60.
---
I have had too many disconnects since the last update and now I'm getting irritated.
---
Not that I am one but there are folks out there that play NW only and aren't interested in adventure mode. They make less score in a week than most adventure mode players get in a day. They get one, ONE score challenge a day and one a week. Maybe let them have it.
---
Not a cause rifle but the cause minigun, gauss shotgun and pistol, cattle prod and the new gauntlet as well as secret service armor, basically any plan you buy with gold bullion.
---
Iv found events dont spawn some hordes or the mining ones have no ore i can mine or collect from the containers üòí
---
Hit 19 before I logged last night.  So far, I haven't lost any score to bugs.
---
I think they could of came out with better stats!
---
If we're being honest here, the ENTIRE level up/card system needs to he scrapped and reworked. Along with having to spend level ups to change your s.p.e.c.i.a.l.
---
The entire system sucks.
---
Fixers aren't legacy and getting pretty common now.
---
Because it's funny how seriously some people take this scuffed game
---
It is for any weapon you want to dupe. Check today on YouTube
---
Have the same card, so you‚Äôre welcome.
---
They're required components to craft the gold bullion gear.
---
Thank you for clarifying, that‚Äôs actually pretty awesome
---
No one on market is buy or selling for 2k caps right now. Everyone is scurrying to get what they can in terms of other legacies to dupe.
---
Do what i did, put her station in open area, i got her on a balcony, and a spike trap where she spawns. Right after spawning just go there and yeet her out of camp. I have a robot launching station set up on the roof for this reason. I even got my jolly fasnacht collectron to say "kill, kill, kill" when he was flying. And then he sings, while crawling to the camp, cause of the broken legs from yeeting. 
---
Seriously, i find it almost therapeutic. You will have to try few times to find a good placement of the spike trap vs spawn point, but its SOOO worth it! Highly recommend.
---
Then Don‚Äôt go to any of The marketplaces lmao
---
I‚Äôve always wanted an explosive laser rifle lol
---
me to Bethesda: yeah this ain't it chief.
---
You can get them from the purveyor or random drop, if your on ps4 I have a few legendary lever rifles.
---
Yeah, the dupe...
---
But B2525 Fixer is not a legacy. Legacies are those items that never drop anymore, removed from the drop table.
---
&gt; i've just been doing the challenge as quick as possible, then leaving my team. 
---
don't be that person. queue as solo. some people are actually playing it for fun.
---
That is steam in general, there are no Fallout 76 local save files, only photos, and a google search will only turn up how to do so on xbox one. There is no mention of local saves in the PC counterpart to the Xbox One crashing article (that one does mention deleting save data) because there are none. https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42913/kw/fallout%2076%20crashing
---
And remember, this game wasn't originally on Steam even, it was on the Bethesda.net client.
---
Just started playing full time last week with new season and still need to finish wastelanders quests. I have 400 scrip from the past few days. So I should try luck with ranged from purveyor?
---
you don't have a chassis? you're just against pa then? also, was the daily to scrap a piece? don't need a chassis for that.... and i swear, there's always one piece on the ground by the tunnel.
---
My main man was an MP before the war, never engaging in real combat, only told to patrol areas that had been taken. Upon arriving in the wasteland he decided he would keep this going by guarding appalachia against any threat he come across attacking or harassing the civilians. My camp is a military checkpoint of sorts that I stand guard at when I'm bored.
---
If you‚Äôre a fan of the fallout franchise you will probably like it. Keep in mind you are asking the sub Reddit for the game so you‚Äôll get mostly positive responses
---
Wrong Sub =)
---
https://youtu.be/6k_iq2f2UQw
---
Check out CaptainNoob, he recently killed the Queen solo in 43sec without Chems or anything like that.
---
It's more like "I hate this fucking game!" \*respawn\*
---
That‚Äôs not a bad idea. I think pa just needs a complete rework I feel like all power armor should give +100 carry weight (+200 for excavator) naturally they should bring the upgrade system from 4 in and maybe instead of legendary pa pieces add an second mod slot for legendary mods
---
Xbox sadly
---
Yeesh that's some fire power! Thanks for the video
---
No worries mate üëçüèª
---
that near impossibly rare JE gat plasma has been duped into oblivion as well if you are a chem enthusiast
---
I‚Äôve only been purchasing the T-65 plans and didn‚Äôt know you needed them for the other plans
---
there‚Äôs no way they didn‚Äôt prepare for this. on xbox ive been getting on half empty servers ever since the legendary run update and it rarely happened before
---
People enjoy the game. Who cares???
---
I dont think myself as a pvper but a bounty hunter
---
Until i get that combat challenge
---
Did you create your alt for role-playing specifically?
---
Im going to love all the toxic kiddies from fortnite screaming into their mics because I won't give them one of my guns
---
I think your post was nonsensical rant with no merit, so a mod scrapped it on a technicality because you used the word trade.
---
I did this heading south between the ash heap and the savage divide. Neat!
---
If you want basically a sandbox game because of new dupe going on, yes.
---
If you want a game that you'll enjoy, no. Just no.
---
People make it worse and worse.
---
Dupe glitch here!
---
God mode there!
---
XP glitch over here!
---
Unless you enjoy that kind of stuff. No.
---
Or spend 15‚Ç¨ a month and buy Fallout first so you have your own server and can play it like a singleplayer/coop with your friends.
---
If you want a good looter shooter, buy Borderlands 2. This. Is horrendous.
---
I don't believe the .50 cal is commando build I think that is a heavy build.
---
I've always wondered when they will expand the map, I've taken a few excursions beyond the normal world border, many beautiful areas that would make amazing camp locations
---
Really depends on how strict you want to be with weight and if you plan on using vats. What platform are you on? I've got a few bloodied handmades.
---
I‚Äôm new not sure what‚Äôs going on
---
If that's the kind of build they're balancing the cryptids against, it's no wonder the damned things are bullet sponges for anything else. That's a broke-ass mechanic, right there.
---
Not true
---
I am happier with f076 uninstalled sadly
---
Its 100% not in my quest log. I tried ur tip a few times even fully re started the game and tried it, no luck. Thank u for trying!
---
Good kid, he'll fit right in. This game is good for kindness, a lot of players do this for others, glad for it since gaming communities can be quite toxic.
---
Not true and you did two identical posts
---
I'm hoping we will get to travel to other locations: Capital Wasteland, the Pitt, Point Lookout... New locations are totally warranted too!!
---
Did you see anything cool, or was it just more of the same stuff as what I saw?
---
No. I wanted to try out the new bow stuff after wastelanders, so I start playing one my alts/mules. I have her almost to level 50 now. Completing the old main quest before moving to the new one 
---
Came up with a backstory as I played.
---
Didn‚Äôt know that! do I need to find headlamp mods or special headlamps with the color? Or just mod the headlamp.
---
RNG is nutty in the game. I think that plan is like a 0.4 percent chance to drop so mathematically I should have gotten it by now but nope.  Then again, however many technical data I've turned in and I have never gotten even the first BOS t60 paint either lol.
---
Yeah, with Bloodied Commando, the important thing is to have a sneak build, you can get your damage right up there. Up to 3.75x more. It‚Äôs arguably the best build you can have.
---
This is the laziest changes they could make to the ammo converter, they're keeping the terminal UI...
---
Question, the picture of your location on the map? Why isn‚Äôt your yellow arrow showing?
---
Just from what I saw, especially since the area west of the forest is so vast, there is A LOT they could do with the area. It's free real estate. Lolz.
---
Thanks for thought, doesn't work, exited vault Reclamation Day Challenge completes, did not count.
---
Similar,  it was like riding an escalator under the map. Then I ‚Äúfell ‚Äú
---
Just out of curiosity, what system are you on? 
---
And this question is also for anyone that experiences frequent crashing. 
---
I play on PC and I don't have a high end rig, but I have had maybe 1 or 2 crashes since the days of beta. I have also noticed that when players report frequent craahing, its mostly on consoles. I'm not bashing anyone or saying it's not Bethesda's fault, but I've definitely noticed a pattern.
---
So for anyone that's interested, you have to visit the cemetery first for the mission to pop

And lots of high radiation lube, and hardened masses.

 I'm grinding for some gold bullion to finish my SS armor. Currently running full scout. I do try to use vats a good deal but depends on the situation. I'm in Xbox!
---
Been playing since launch, almost level 500, never seen legacies or bloodied fixers in vendors. Go ahead and downvote.
---
I was almost done with one last night and then my game lagged and then it froze. I was like welp onto the next one.
---
Im excited for the jetpack that looks like the one from the rocketeer and marine grass armor
---
Just what I'll be using until I get a bloodied commando weapon. Need some lucky rolls or good trades!
---
&gt; and fucks you in the ass
---
Well now we're talkin'!
---
Haha that's pretty cool! Any fun rescue stories?
---
I don't use 2mm and I feel for those that do. It's complete bullshit that you can't make it with the machine. Maybe they knew we would just toss it in our vendors to make caps. Or because it's the easiest to make.
---
wait can you explain further? do I need 100 lvl each 1 lvl of legendary perk?
---
Ammo crafting in New Vegas was even more unnecessarily complicated than this, though, making you collect different powders, primers, and cases for each ammo type. Not to mention less flexible; I can't scrap 5mm or .38 to get what I need to make Arrows or Fusion Cells, but with 76's simple AmmoPoints currency I can. 
---
The AmmoPoints converter just has a shitty interface, which they're fixing.
---
You've not even got one?
---
Feed the people. It is easy, simple and you get 3 to 6 canned meat stews. 
---
 I also like how he says Mama Dolce.
---
Top boxes are filled with legendary fixers and handmades!
---
Or just the same exact stuff as the other boxes.  Can't remember, haven't done the event in a while but it is definitely one of these 2 things.
---
The wayward, the radio DJ (as a pro-settler option for some variety in our settler rep) and Vault 79 all could use a repeatable daily if you ask me. Give us a reason to interact with these people!
---
I have already seen it. And thus the "Yet Another" part of the title. What I had *not* seen was the advice you gave me on how to avoid the problem in the future. Thank you for that. 
---
We know Bethesda watches this forum. People shouldn't be discouraged from making sure Bethesda realizes that their issue is continuing and affecting more and more people. Honestly, I don't think it would be amiss for every person who experiences a bug to make a separate post about it and flood them with complaints.
---
I found one but it took about 30 minutes
---
While I agree with things like the legendary perk system should be tied to xp or some other existing thing, I'm fine with a currency if it's like earning tickets in an arcade like a previous poster mentioned: here are some specific challenges and activities, but instead of us randomly telling you what you get from completion of these activities or having it be pure rng, here's something to help facilitate being able to make the choice yourself.
---
I.e., doing things specific to camden park in order to get rewards specific to camden park, and making that use a currency you can only use at camden park. If I could just use caps, it would circumvent the need to do the activities relevant to that location.
---
Caps aren't THAT hard to get, so it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility to empty a vendor out if they gave a caps equivalent method to buy in.
---
Currencies are meant to tie specific activities to specific rewards. It gets frustrating when there's dozens of them, and at that time it would be advantageous to reduce and condense. Think of it more that, instead of the rewards bekng random drops, they "weight" the rewards and let you work towards them.
---
Just my two cents, not saying you're wrong, just giving another perspective.
---
I just got the game about 3 weeks ago and have spent over 130hours playing it. So I would say it‚Äôs worth it as I‚Äôm addicted currently. The storyline along with the new wastlanders expansion are really good imo. Even the random holotapes you come across in the world are really good as well and give a touch of what happened in that area. The community and people are very friendly and willing to help however they can when i was in my lower levels random people would always drop health, food, water and bullets. Getting towards the end game can be grindy like a typical MMO. They just added seasons which gives you another thing to work towards as well. If I‚Äôm not mistaken it‚Äôs around $20-30 rang right now so we‚Äôll worth that for what you are getting.
---
You don't have to choose between raiders and settlers for anything other than the vault 79 raid, make sure you do all of the lead up quests for both factions until theyre both ready to do the raid. Choose a side and do the raid, its really inconsequential who you choose, After that you will lose a little rep depending on your actions but you can keep doing dailies from that point to max out rep with both factions.
---
Yeah, this is my reaction. A lot of people rage but I laugh at how ridiculous it is. Also it's something I expect to happen to random crashes/bugs in this game don't bother me like they would in other games. It's a Bethesda game so I expect jank every time I play.

yes i have this issue too

Despite all the jank it's still fun and a relatively unique game. I don't know of a ton of looter shooters out there with base building elements. Maybe Rust?
---
I have 2 different characters. One with power armor and the other without. I don‚Äôt really know where any PA pieces spawn without a chassis unfortunately.
---
You get 2 doing the main questline.
---
Oh man I feel dumb, it HAD to start happening after Wastelanders because we had no human npc's before that lol. I think it was the first update we had *after* Wastelanders, because I strictly remember the Raiders at my camp being just fine for a while before it started happening.
---
Doesn't matter which one you pick, you can end up being Ally with both. Just make sure to take the full 1000 gold at the end. Only a chump worries about an NPC's feeling.
---
You were able to go under the map? Weird, I didn't go under until I hit the part where it just dropped me off, the whole rest of the way was just normal ground.
---
Is explaining it in the post title not enough?
---
So the work around is just to stay out of Nuclear Winter?   Seems easy enough to do till a solution is developed.

Same as the other boxes, occasionally something different.

This was 100% true!  They fixed the old glitch that caused atom challenges to auto complete.
---
However they removed said challenges so we‚Äôll really never know if they were fixed, but I believe Bethesda!
---
The SCORE challenge issue is a totally new bug.  Since it took about a year to fix the atom challenges bug (which, again, is totally fixed), i‚Äôd guess on a similar timeline for the SCORE fix.  Maybe even 6 months, things are really looking better now!
---
The Mothman one or Uranium Fever because they can be done solo. I also like Heart of the Swamp and the Meditation one with all the ghouls. So much XP.

Betheds.net launcher and Steam players are on the same servers, so I believe the same will be true for Gamepass and the Widows 10 Store version, as they all use Bethesda.net servers. If he already has Game Pass it costs you nothing to try. Just remember to have him make a Bethesda.net account or his name will be a very long string of random letters and numbers.
---
Ok gotcha!  Just making sure I did not want you to do all the work and then be like "Why is the damage not great"  cause commando is Per and Agi and Heavy is Str.

Why would other people duping cause you to lose anything?  Short of you handing them your stuff I'm not sure what you expect them to do.

During the event last October, one person I used to play with constantly blue screened.  At one point he finished the event, won the pirate costume  he had been wanting to win, blue screened as the rewards were listed, the pirate costume being one of them.  Once he loaded back in, it didn't acknowledge his win.  There wasn't any laughter from his side.
---
That is completely empty. I tried it 12 times.
---
It is the one everybody seems to be making a beeline for.

It is. I literally just got done claiming my excellent ghoul slayers Plasma guns and two shot pipe pistols, topped off with some nice crossbows and assassins fat man for the low low price of 75 scrip each.

Each perk card can be traded for 1 perk coin. 100 then 150 then 200 perk coins are required to rank up legendary perks to level 4.
---
and to get the coin?
---
Does it still give go to every person on the server even if they don't do it?
---
Bro, I give a shit about this person's health. I'm not talking at all about the video game. 
---
If your takeaway from what I wrote was to write up another pointless breakdown of why the grind is not that bad, you're missing ***the point I was making entirely***. I didn't say one thing about the battle pass or any of that. 
---
You're just here to bitch and fight with someone on some "nuh-uh!" shit.
---
So? Im still never going to buy anything from another player. I dont care what they are selling. Ill earn my gear and everyone else can do as they please. Ill be on my private server never seeing them.
---
Log out and log in again. Worked for a dude earlier I saw. I‚Äôd close the game fully to make sure I guess.
---
You may be experiencing the bug where the reload speed gets inverted and you reload even slower than default. Swapping weapons or unequipping and re-equiping fixes it. That's been around forever.
---
yeah it really sucks.  Flooding the market with god rolls makes it so when you get that amazing drop it's not so special anymore because everyone else already has it or something better.
---
Nothing is special or unique if everyone has everything.
---
If they killed you that impossible
---
so "Candy Claws" isn't cuttin it for ya?

I logged on soon before the shutdown for the fix for the vending machines. I noticed two lowish level Japanese players in a silo (lvl 45 and 70). I kept tabs on them hoping they would launch. I knew the server was due to shutdown at midnight for the patch.
---
Time rolled on and I thought these guys were too late.The shutdown was imminient. Just before midnight they launched and I thought "Fuck it. I'm in".
---
Midnight passed and there was no shutdown. Beth was late. I rocked up to V9 and was joined by my Japanese bros and one other player. The nuke hit and Queenie awoke.
---
The first moments were normal, but then the server shutdown timer appeared. Things got desparate.
---
We waged war against her. The timer counted down to below 1 minute, at which point I could not see how much time we had left, because the seconds were off the screen.
---
I popped a psychotats and unleashed hell, and the queen fell. We looted her and I had just enough time to throw up a heart emote and a thumbs up when... 
---
....Server Disconnected.
---
Absolutely brilliant fight.
---
Edit: Hit post too soon.
---
I was doing the radiation rumble on the last day of triple Xp, but the game crashed and I was so tired I just got off
---

---
&gt;Ill be on my private server never seeing them.
---
Why do you even play an online game then lol
---
Encrypted. I died and respawned. But not fully. Lost all the loot. I also started the event
---
I don't disagree- I just think people are tired and frustrated with the glitch and don't want to think about it anymore.  I think Bethesda will probably fix this with next update.... (he says hopefully).
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm definitely using that next time
---
Crap worked first time for me
---
No. Think that was fixed a long time ago.
---
There's a lot of that going on in the game. How do you usually play with two other guys. I save the ammo that I know they're going to be using and then just give it to them. And likewise. I'll run into a lower-level flyer player and just drop random things help them.. the atmosphere is totally different from when it was released two years ago
---
u/ladydevann u/valseek the grind is insane and needs a rework
---
Ooooooh that's what those random player names were all about. I always thought it was a cracked verson player.
---
Get the Flamer barrel and the broken mod from Regs, you will not regret it.
---
I love NW. The challenges are absolutely brainless and easy. In fact, allow NW XP to count toward score which it does not. It's stupid to have a challenge for NW but those who play it primarily are missing out on score.
---
It's an amount of dailies. Next to it has a counter. (-/5)
---
So you have to do 5 dailies.
---
I was confused at first too.
---
It worked, much appreciated
---
Candy Claws? Where do I find that? Gimme gimme gimme! Although, Gold would be awesome.

---
you scrap perk cards
---
are you sure you aren't looking at the 'complete a daily quest' one? this means things like fetching 10 honey for sweetwater.
---
Lol. I think you got downvoted because you have friends. That‚Äôs hilarious.
---
It‚Äôs a bug. They‚Äôre also highly useless and can‚Äôt be sold so I just throw them randomly if I get any when doing my roomba moves on corpses.
---
I just laugh and relaunch just expect all patches or anything that changes will break the game in some way.
---
I dunno, at this point, while I'm not steamrolling everything, I sometimea dread going back to earlier areas if I need to farm cooking supplies and all the mobs give me piddly xp from defeating them.
---
Equalization would be good if it meant that the AI actually got harder in the currently harder areas. Like, in the cranberry bog, you'd run into enemies that flanked, dove for cover, threw throwables, etc. a lot more than usual, and then in the Forest you'd get enemies that would be a lot more of a one-track mind, running at you with a pipe wrench and no strategy whatsoever.
---
(Aka, make the game harder because the enemies are smarter, not because they ate a heartier breakfast.)
---
Fear is the mind killer
---
Nope, it's Steam players who don't have a linked Bethesda.net account. It's essentially showing an internal ID because they have no name set.
---
You shouldn't lose the Legendary Run Gold. It shows up on any character you claim it for. I claimed it on my level 15 new character and I received it on that character. You can't even start the quests to get to the faction choice until level 20. May want to check your character by going to the gold vendor and seeing what shows in your currency window.
---
The counter there is 1, not 5. The 5 is for the daily challenges. We have a challenge that needs 1 daily quest.
---
I believe MODUS sells the plan
---
Stick with 2* if you wanna get a decent roll at the very least. 3* has the worst RNG sometimes
---
Only need to do one for todays challenge.
---
I did the ‚Äúburied with honor‚Äù one - take remains from ft picket to Phillipi cemetery.  
---
It counted.
---
&gt;i dont even think banning is the right answer, because its easy to make a new account
---
I heard they can somehow ban your PC hardware so you'd need more than just a new account but there's prob ways around that as well
---
I did actually look at the list wrong
---
s√≥ that actually sucks and the perks there aren't good enough for the mindless grind to get them
---
What a salty sally
---
Okay, 19k karma well known person will there be bans for holding onto the grenades?
---
You are fear mongering and  playing stupid
---
Mines been more like finding things I still can‚Äôt delete in my camp, it‚Äôs almost like checking the mail. Once a week or so I‚Äôll dip in see if I can get rid of something find out I still can‚Äôt scrap this greenhouse dome get my free junk mail item and hope eventually my package shows up for the game I hope it would be shows up.

They have lasted a long time. They were supposedly fixed on the PTS, for patch 20, but when it went live magic effects still worked. Even on new drops.

Daily S.C.O.R.E. challenges not Daily pip boy..... Honestly fuck this season they keep fucking up the daily updates and I'm losing like 2000 worth of season points at a time...2 different days now.... That repeatable Xp challenge should really be 500 or 1000 S.C.O.R.E and not 100 as well....I defended them a lot at the beginning of this season against people complaining they didn't come out with any story missions along with the season pass but I can't defend then anymore......it seems like they are fucking up on purpose so people will have to buy atoms to boost progression speed, especially will all the refusals to fix the problems people are reporting in tickets because Bethesda "doesn't have the ability to adjust S.C.O.R.E"
---
I'm having the same problem.
---
What system you on? I literally just got a gauss rifle plan earlier from the blood eagle base in the cranberry bog from a safe. I already have it so you would be free to have it if PC
---
The 10x and 100x is one top of the amount of ammo you'd trade in before, so there is that.
---
Been playing since beta. The joke is the will add more stuff just to lock it behind another grind and currency
---
When I say fucking up daily updates too I mean only 2 of all the challenges are renewing... Happened 2 or 3 times now
---
Quick question, was this only during Faschnacht or is the beeswax always there?
---
I thought I just wasn't searching enough. But looking back I use to sell stacks of them I would get all the time.
---
It was in the Atomic Shop during the Holidays, I'd expect it to return again, but likely not until the Holidays...
---

---
Lol such is the reddit way.
---
You know what. Yeah, your right, I didn't get that. I assumed you were looking for the power armor chassis locations, to get pieces to scrap, not that you needed a chassis in the first place. 
---
So yeah, it's there. Wasn't that clear, but I get it now.
---
I picked one up in a silo ten mins ago and haven't noticed the lack of them lately. Ps4 if that makes a difference
---
Ive only found one since the patch. They seem much rarer at least.
---
i mean, it does suck.  some of those perks are pretty nice, as long as they're pretty nice at one or two stars, maybe it won't be a total disaster.  I dunno.  I'm not doing the PTS personally, so I dunno if they are or are not ok at lower levels or not.  I'm definitely not going to stress about maxing them out.
---
So basically they've decided the best method to keep people playing is to give us nearly impossible grinds.
---
It's like Blizzard with WoW, circa 2006.
---
&gt;Follow Through - Ranged sneak damage increases damage to target by 10%/20%/30%/40% for 10 seconds
---
If you cause ranged sneak attack damage, that target will receive 10%/20%/30%/40% more damage for 10 seconds. It's unclear by the wording whether or not this only affects your damage or damage from all sources.
---
You get Piper's outfit, hat and goggles from fallout 4, and a bunch of repair and scrap kits.
---
I like Uranium Fever because I just came back to the game a couple weeks ago and started a new character, so the couple legendaries that spawn are a chance for potentially good gear.  It's also great for the SCORE tasks requiring you to kill legendaries, if I'm not mistaken, 3 always spawn. Plus a ton of materials and stuff from all the Mole Miners.
---
I just want a TSE minigun, could care less if it was duped.
---
Country roads and the ring of fire would be nice
---
I don't think I've seen one anywhere outside a vendor for a couple months now.
---
I saw it while entering the game. It was on the Xbox store so I think it is like not in the Atom Shop.
---
Not a chance you‚Äôre perfectly safe. It‚Äôs not hacked in, it‚Äôs not a dupe, it‚Äôs not a mod, it‚Äôs just an unfortunate side effect of the latest patch opening up drops unintentionally.
---
They can‚Äôt ban people for using something they put in all over the place and it confers no real benefit because they‚Äôre actually awful and they‚Äôve cut down on my selling normal grenades to traders. 
---
Just leave em if you notice, they‚Äôve really not worth the space they take at all.
---
Do the vault prep for both sides but don‚Äôt choose either one until this is completed. You‚Äôll get a pop-up making it very clear that you‚Äôre about to pick a side. 
---
once you‚Äôve got the vault prep done for both (and have seen the pop up both times, there should be two quests; **Siding with Foundation** and **Siding with Crater**
---
The Raider version is slightly more complicated, but can have some additional rewards. The Settler side is mostly straightforward in my opinion. 
---
You will still be able to earn reputation from the daily repeatables for both sides. You don‚Äôt have to max out either side before doing the raid. 
---
Here is a [link](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations)  that breaks down the reputation levels and how much you get from each event/quest/action.
---
If you want to get the most rep on both sides, this will help. 
---
Example: sticking to the deal gets you 1000 rep for that side. 
---
Splitting the gold between the two sides doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre donating your half. It means that 500  gold you promised to one side is split up equally (250 each). You will gain only 300 rep (700 less rep than normal) with your active side but gain 900 rep with the inactive side, for a net gain of 200 rep. That means it will take about 3 extra days to regain the lost 700 rep with that faction.   Factor that into your decision. 
---
If you keep all the gold for yourself, you lose 500 rep with that faction and don‚Äôt gain the 1000 potential for honoring the original agreement I modified. So that‚Äôs a net loss of 1500 rep with that side, or about 5 days of missions for them. 
---
You can earn up to 200 gold per day, if you grind the three dailies (Raider/Foundation/Davenport) and do other public events. Taking all the gold for yourself only gets you 500 more. 
---
So essentially, I wouldn‚Äôt take all the gold for yourself. You gain 500 more gold (which is 2.5 days of mild grinding) but it will take about 5 days to regain the net loss of rep. 
---
If you only care about the max rep rewards for one side and want to get there are soon as possible, that‚Äôs the side to do the raid with and stick to the deal.  That‚Äôs about 2250-2500 extra rep with them. 
---
If you want both max reps, then split the gold. It nets you 200 more rep overall. I‚Äôd also do the raid with whichever side I have the *lower* reputation.  Your side will get about 1800 rep and the other side will get 900 rep. 
---
Hope that helps!
---
Honestly, I think these places (Wayward and Secret Service) would be good for dailies that reward small amounts of Gold Bullion (not treasury notes).
---
Secret Service could be a random quest that pays you in pure gold, and Wayward could have a treasure hunting quest where you find some gold.
---
That way, there's a little extra gold grind except for the 6000 caps a week and 20 notes a day.
---
I've been having exactly the same issue.
---
I pretty much asked the same question yesterday, as I was just short of the legendary run award to get bullion.
---
A couple of people said they got the 25 bullion even through theyhad not completed the raid. (obviously, cant use it yet)
---
Another poster said the grind for max rep takes so long you are losing out on lots of bullion opportunities.
---
I‚Äôm headed to the vault tonight :)
---
oh shit bro that‚Äôs awesome thanks! I‚Äôm on Pc my username is wureide
---
I always get them I got like 8 of them yesterday (ps4)
---
YES GOODBYE 2000 ROUNDS OF .38
---
What if you don't want a weapon that shouldn't even exist?
---
I still have to pay 45k for that J/E/15 Lever 
---
But you can get B2525 for literally the amount of caps you need to fast travel. 
---
Logic please?
---
Oh right lol.

But I have seen this happen to non-human npcs plenty. The biggest offender for me are the mutant doggos at West Tek. Even on fresh private world's I'll hear a bunch of em die at once as soon as I load into area, outside and inside. Not all the time of course but when it does its always multiples.
---
I'm yet fleshing out my build, and those legendary perks feels like i will need to scrap perks that I need like craft ones to get at least one star, not worth, I'm still at lvl 72
---
Big mood.
---
Lol guess I missed reading that.
---
They absolutely should (and have) to do something about the lost cards. Even if that's just giving people a bunch of coins based on their level to start.
---
I will say though that this clearly isn't supposed to be grinded. I know there are some players who will grind anything anyway, and are upset that they can't have anything immediately. And there are players who are bored of the game and want new stuff to do, even if it is grinding out gold or score or legendary perks. But if you play the game normally and unlock things as you go, things like the gold bullion system aren't awful. However, with the legendary perks there's way too much of a dry spell before you get a reward, which exacerbates the problems and the grind.
---
I believe you have to by atoms to get the free stuff.
---
thank God someone else has. I put in a ticket for it. Fingers crossed they can/will do something to fix it.
---
Path of Exile: *Am I a joke to you?!*
---
Yes, I had a Furious 25, 15 for the longest time and never pulled it out of stash due to the low damage of the rifle mods.  I had someone tell me to put a flamer barrel on it and I take down level 80 3 star scorch beasts in about 6-8 seconds.  (its funny to watch them take 0 damage as they ready their explosion ground attack, they actually get I frames during it)
---
The only real problem is you run through ammo like its nothing, and the ammo is heavy w/o reduction.  At least it holds around 300 ammo per mag.
---
The airport has a couple safes. One in the tents behind the main building. And another in those rounded air hangers in the opposite direction.
---
I did the same thing last night at the airport. A YouTuber pointed out that there is a locked safe in the airport at the north end. So I spawned right there, and 3 times in a row ran straight there and unlocked it.
---
Of course, all 3 times apparently other people had the same idea and got to the cockpit moments after I unlocked it, and killed me all 3 times.
---
I got my SCORE though so I didn't care!
---
I grab Technical Data nearly daily and turn them in at Camp venture.  I usually find them at Watoga High in the office to the left of the main entrance, in the file cabinets.  I stilll find them in a number of other places also, but I'm specifically in Watoga grabbing plastic after SBQ runs.  Turned in three in the last week.
---
Support request maybe?
---
I think only during the event as you needed beeswax to turn in. Haven't checked so it might be worth looking to see if it is still there
---
Ha first time anyone has actually been on the same system when I‚Äôve offered anything on here. Bonus! 
---
I‚Äôm not online at the min but I‚Äôll hop on and add you and drop in my private world soon if you‚Äôre about.

The only games I have ever blue screened on ps4 are fo76 and eso, but they say its my playstation and not there games...
---
I played for 3 hours and couldn't fix one that hadn't been picked, then reddit tipped to one in the train yard and I was fine in like 20 minutes lol. But I didn't think I was going to finish that one either
---
Np!
---
Here is the build that I use.  You just swap out Rifleman for Commando.  I just recently went with a bloodied build for the first time about 2 weeks ago.  I just happen to get a B3315 Handmade from the Rusty Pick and it has been a ton of fun and super stressful once you get detected.

---
That sounds cool, but you have to remember the purpose of the Wayward Questline is to be one of the first quests newbies do. That exact questline may lead to their first legendary (if they only do it).
---
I get adding more content to it... But adding endgame content to the early game content (the Robco Vault) seems weird to me.
---
And endgame treasure hunting quest would be cool though. Kinda bring it full circle.
---
"Each card requires 100 coins to level, or 400 for max rank.
---
That's 2,400 perk Coins to max six cards.
---
Assuming you scrap EVERY CARD, you're looking at 180 coins per 100 levels, factoring in card packs."
---
I have been testing and rank 2 of a card requires 150 coins to level up. Not sure if more rank requires more coins
---
Have you checked the enclave bunker?
---
$8 for 1100 atoms, both Piper's outfit &amp; cap plus 5 scrap &amp; repair kits each. 
---
Tbh it isn't all that bad of a deal.
---
They are in the desks in the military wing too.
---
My personal favourite and it happened all the time was power up poseidon, take the workshop, crash.
---
Only regular spawn for me is in the Whitesprings Bunker. I get one daily on my XP grind through Whitesprings golf clubhouse.
---
Okay, I‚Äôll check when I‚Äôm back on.
---
Found loads. Sugar bombs on the other hand...
---
Does it use rifleman perks?
---
Use the website Fed76. I usually sell about 500-1k under the lowest number and it works well.
---
But Bethesda was bad quite long before the virus.
---
That's what I was experiencing early on. I used to find several per hour. I was constantly making trips to drop it. Then suddenly... Nada.
---
Do you want the long way or the short way? The short way is to get a nuclear key card from a cargo bot accompanied by the vertibots, go to a silo, fight through it, do a few missions as well inside the silo. Then when you reach the end and have to enter the card and key code look up the weekly codes on Nukacrypt.
---
The long way is a lot more involved in what I consider a way to involved mission and honestly have never figured out the codes myself. You get slivers of the code from killing those scorched with the backpacks that's make the annoying beeping sound.
---
Broken mod?
---
I feel like excavator lucky hole is more than enough, you'll run out of steel farming for like a week before that lead runs dry
---
Gotcha, I found it on the PS store, thanks! And yeah, not bad of a deal at all!
---
I forget the name, but it‚Äôs a capacitor mod intended to be used on the Plasma Caster, but you can apply it to the rifle.
---
If it asks for a daily challenge. All of the other daily challenges count. If it asks for a daily quest, all of the daily quests count.
---
The way PA is marketed in F76 too. It, like other things, is essentially a collectible. We should be able to display them for sure. Why have so many skins if not? 
---
Also, we need regular outfit/armor displays.
---
About 50% of the time when I log in and I spawn by my camp, I drop through the world. I'm not even that high of a level and I've just gotten desensitized to it. I just relog and thank Todd for strengthening my ability to accept the things I cannot change.

Um... I don‚Äôt understand how duping would affect your gear?

I've tried everywhere. I've been experiencing this for awhile and i had a strong farming route prior. I was hoping update 20 might fix it. I put in a ticket this morning.

I have a trouble shooters 25/15 if thats any better for you.

This is my current built  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8f4459b&amp;d=sf2sg2s01pl2pr2pp2pd2pk2eu0eh2c62ce0ir2ic1a04an2ao0la2l71lt2lu2](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8f4459b&amp;d=sf2sg2s01pl2pr2pp2pd2pk2eu0eh2c62ce0ir2ic1a04an2ao0la2l71lt2lu2) 
---
I have adrenaline switched out for sneak and mister sandman for the time being.
---
I myself use a sniper build, and I'll give you a couple tips.  First of all, your maximum damage is going to be with Bloodied and +10% Damage while aiming.  Long Shot is really important because it can nearly double your damage at a distance.  For fighting things like the Queen, you can stay in effective range and keep attacking while others just sit around.  For solo, it's great, because you can stay away from all the adds and hit her easy.   It's a great build if you want to solo the queen very efficiently.   
---
Unyeilding armor will help you get rid of the strong back perk, also carnivore and either smoked mirelurk filets or radstag meat will make up your carry weight.  Backpacks are nice too.
---
Going the +10% damage while aiming though is important because then you don't have to waste 5 perk points into demolition expert and it actually does more damage.  If you do vats, lever action is great.  I still use a Lever action with explosive damage in vats when I'm lazy, or need to kill adds quickly.  Adamantium skeleton is useless.  There are better perks for survivability than lone wanderer.  Get Nerd Rage.   Alot of the perks you get will depend on your armor and weapons available, once you get some armor with good sneaking, you can ditch the sneak perks and move them to more useful things.  I would while there's the purveyor sale, try hard to get a bloodied rifle, handmade is better for manual aiming, fixer is good for vats.  Any rifle would work though, then try to get a full set of unyeilding.
---
is unyielding worth it on non-bloody builds?
---
Look in th Enclave Bunker in the military wing. Don't loot any desks that don't have the technical documents at all, when you find one that does, just take the one. Turn it in, rinse &amp; repeat. The other desks you didn't loot should have another one. Did 6 times yesterday. Just grabbed my 1st for today.
---
Muad‚Äôdib!
---
I don't own ESO but that only supports both our statements. Maybe they should stick to single player.
---
yeah, i think legendary perks are going to be most useful for characters at or above level 100 or so.   Most of my builds didn't get all the perks they needed (including QOL and crafting perks) until close to 100.  hard to scrap cards for legendary perks until you stop needing all the cards :)
---
Howd you make it rounded?
---
Bethesda Sortaworks‚Ñ¢
---
Before I knew it was a joke post I read the first sentence and said, ‚Äúthis is so ridiculous it can only be a joke.‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôm glad I was right.
---
Yeah especially when I really only use 1 suit regularly (excavator) and the rest are just kinda sitting in my box. The collector in me doesnt want to get rid of them lol.
---
I usually try and drop either food and water or stims. At least that way I know they will be used lol
---
yuup. I've spent over a month so far hoping the issue was my imagination but it is definitely a bug. I put in a support ticket today.
---
I have the military paint for the x-01. But I don‚Äôt know if there are no military paint plans for the other power armor. Or I just haven‚Äôt found them yet.
---
I‚Äôve sort of just become resigned to it. Teams help, since I can jump back into an event or not lose my progress completely (I like powering up the power plants), but some timed events really suck to crash out of and I crash routinely on. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had a single clean run on Project Paradise. My Xbox has a really hard time with large spawns of mobs, in general - the Meat Week events mostly worked fine, but I crashed in the Mire every time the Mirelurk Queen lived long enough to start dropping Mirelurk Spawn everywhere (one time I went down to 1 frame per minute and couldn‚Äôt force quit the game). Usually I can easily point my finger at the game alone, but sometimes it‚Äôs the combo of the game and my hardware.
---
Bestheda dev's be like "aw what was that? You need ANOTHER huge grind and waste of time? Haha ok sure no problem :)"
---
Y
---
Updated post with my video showing the boost going well over 50
---
When i was like lvl 25,  had explored the whole morgan town area so was overburdened with junk and doing the quest. I didnt know it that when i drank the nukeshine it would randomly teleport me It teleported me into a nuked zone, I die almost instantly. Attempt to respawn and blue screened. Still pains me to think about it.
---
Is it in that bad of a state?  Asking because it's currently on Xbox Game Pass for PC and I want to try it, and even though it's free I only want to download it if its worth the time I'm going to put into it and take away from the other games I'm playing.  So in short, am I going to be disappointed that I wasted time on trying the game out?
---
It‚Äôs sad because my pc can run it fine it‚Äôs just my connection that makes the game stutter like all hell
---
You suffer from some severe dyslexia? OP asked about getting calibrated shocks on power armor, not buying serums from vendors.
---
Yeah - tried that once, was right behind them and started shooting they took hardly any damage and were up and away while every shot that came back seemed to take a quarter of my health. I decided just to let them keep going from then on. 
---
I wish I could keep my marsupial going into it so I could find a nice try to hide in.
---
posted vid. Should debunk the myth
---
Big facts
---
It's around 20ish. Can't remember precisely as it's been a while since I tested it.
---
I am not sure you understand pay to win
---
I'm online now my dude if you're ready? Just logging into my alt that has it and sending you a request
---
I briefly played a D&amp;D game where it took 3 months to level up \*once\*. Sounds like something the DM of that game would come up with.
---
I mean i dont play it so yeah.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Sorry to hear about the hassle.  Other Quests definitely glitch, so maybe that's what's happening to you.  My Queen of the Hunt daily glitched and was un-solveable for a couple months, but at least it was common enough that I found a solution.  Good luck!
---
Yeah I do.  I‚Äôm on PC
---
I've obviously told to the wrong post in error. Thank you for your calm and polite response.
---
well the feature is coming eventually
---
I got a Christmas skin last night. So, unless the patching was sometime between midnight and now it's still active.
---
I forgot to add the /s for sarcasm it seems.
---
Yeah I do. I said it‚Äôs more like pay yo win. Not is. The English language is amazing in how it allows nuanced ideas.
---
Yes "perk coins" sounds like we are playing, some FTP mobile candycrap?
---
Thanks, I guess picking up the initial perk pack is not counted as a "level up" so lvl 2 is the starting level? In that case a friend with some molotovs would make tagging easy
---
I can‚Äôt play today :( you playing tomorrow ? let‚Äôs go to the messages and chat there
---
Pulse capacitor? You don‚Äôt need to buy the caster‚Äôs plan from Regs to equip it. It was added to the plasma rifle with Wastelanders as a mod anyone can craft. I was able to craft it on a plasma rifle before I even finished the vault raid.
---
yeah, I've tried that as well. multiple server jumps, not looting anything. At this point im convinced that it is a bug. IIRC before it started I had a stack of Data in my stash that I had stored while leveling prior to discovering that you could only start the quest with 1 fresh one in your inventory. I dropped those before i logged out. I'm wondering if that caused some kind of issue with the spawn trigger. I've put a ticket in, so we shall see what Bethesda has to say.
---
Oh, weird. Is it the one that makes the barrel all low res and choppy??
---
same here
---
o\_O
---
I got the last xmas reward around 6 hours ago so as of then it was still active.
---
The way it should work is the spawn level bounds of enemies remain the same, they just ignore other player's levels. If a level 20 goes into cranberry bog with a level 200, the level 200 should see all enemies at their max level, but the level 20 will see all enemies at their minimum level, which is still above 20 and will tear that poor player to pieces.
---
same here.  Looking at the rewards I‚Äôm aiming for level 71 or 72 as my finish by September.  If I don‚Äôt get that far do be it.
---
So like tenderiser but only for range sneak?
---
Actually freeze grenades help against queen and imposter believe it or not
---
To add insult to injury, they don't even listen to good suggestions.
---
We've been waiting on some kind of mailbox inter-character item trade system for about as long as the overencumbered fast travel and respawn bug fixes.
---
Meanwhile, I just sold a stack of 30 of them to a vendor last night to clean out my inventory.
---
Yo seriously calm the fuck down it's a game it's a fake economy let people have what they want
---
Didn't try that. Just chucked the rest and was underwhelmed at best :D
---
Just look up the stash tabs for all the various currencies, shards, cards, etc., it's ridiculous.
---
Thank you for debunking the myth
---
The perk cards were actually one of my favorite things about the game before launch. In practice it has a lot of problems, with near useless cards in addition to the randoms and duplicates which bloat the system.
---
Let it burn! üî•üî•üî•üî•
---
Ah no worries, I added you anyway so you can just accept and join or whatever when you get chance, or just PM me here etc.
---
Games been crashing more ive noticed. Makes me worry about taking workshops if I'm just gonna lose it to an error....
---
Data or suger bombs? If it's the latter you're a monster.
---
Feature!  U funny K
---
My character is young and was born in the vault. His father was killed by the scorched plague and now my character owns the Mothman Inn right by Top of the World. He found the cure of the plague and spreads it around to all who need it
---
I think you need to up your comprehension game, as I never said 'you think it is pay to win', but rather 'I don't think you understand pay to win', as you linked pay to win with an in-game currency that cannot be purchased for irl money. This would be no more pay to win then scrip at the purveyor or caps at vendors
---
I had the worst ever today, after putting 1800 Ultracite .45s into SBQ, getting her down, getting one hit booped in the noggin with an axe before I could grab my loot and losing all my flux then blue screen while respawning. I've never been so salty at a video game in my life
---
Dupers are back at it again?
---
Crashes? No. Bugs? Yes. (Waits for cascade of downvotes from the strugglebus hive)
---
You also now can keep and sell extra containers from feed the people
---
Yawn. Just repeating what I said. How boring. Seriously, go away.
---
This build isn‚Äôt about having high damage. I loathe bloodied. So I won‚Äôt be using it. Same with unyielding. I prefer to have a more unique build over sheepish build.
---
Well, I'll take them because I don't own the plans and I've been hoarding the sacs there pretty cool to use them in my opinion
---
Never even considered spending gold on the plans.  Now that I've found them and used a few I dont think I would waste gold on them if they were the only thing left for me to spend gold on.   They need some serious work, super anemic and can barely even be classified as an explosion.
---
Only thing they are good for is throwing at events to make people look around to make sure a floater isn't behind them.
---
That's how I like to play. Don't over think it but let the story come to you
---
It would solve many problems. And then just allow us to dump excess regular cards or something.
---
The most popular ammo is 5mm, 50cal .308, .45, and 10 mm
---
There ain‚Äôt shit on Xbox. I‚Äôm lucky if I find one item a week worth buying.
---
Line in the Sand. I love that event. Solo it all the time, even better with a great team.
---
Yeah new b2525 glitch
---
wah wah wah
---
cool! thanks bro! see you tomorrow then
---
Sugar Bombs... i didn't realize they were that rare. From now on I guess I'll hold on to them. If I get a big stash again, I'll let you know. lol.
---
Yes, even though its an automatic flamer barrel, rifleman effects it not commando.
---
All I do is *sigh* and say ‚Äúoh Bethesda‚Äù...
---
if there‚Äôs bitchin to do imma do it
---
I'll hop on my main and alt and see if i can find one.
---
Because not a single dev plays this game or has any ability to add anything right. If it doesn't make the top dogs money it wont happen. Even if it's the correct thing to do.
---
I hit back, so yes, it is possible.
---
Yes, or drops from enemies.
---
Please explain your fear?
---
Yeah I tried the flamer one first and I was like is that it? Was a super letdown and I didn‚Äôt even buy them. If I had, I‚Äôd be crestfallen with what they confer. 
---
I was slinging them everywhere during lode baring and people were so confused.
---
I‚Äôd like to see vaults be more along the lines of dungeons from eso. You and a team go in and do a repeatable quest that drops high tier loot on completion. Then eventually bring in new places that could be set up as raids for even better high tier loot
---
Did you count vault steel? Anyways I cannot for the life of me understand why they took something that could have been simple, like scrapping ammo for base components, and turned it into the asinine system we have now. Maybe they didn't want useless ammo to be turned into caps through gunpowder or nuclear material or what have you, but you've already got the artificially low daily and overall caps limits in place!
---
I just ran into a player at Sutton station that wanted to trade. Had about 25 legacies on him. Unreal. I‚Äôm just running around with my shitty furious handmade.
---
Mine would have been a toddler before the war! There aren't enough youthful types who can't remember the golden olden days! 
---
Although mine still thinks the best cured for a scorch victim is a bullet in the head. I'll get to the wastelanders questline soon lol

L4instigating bow. üòÇ

I'm sure they will.

Good Mothman some of these are nice.

I think I'm gonna go with What Rads, Master Infiltrator, Ammo Factory, and Legendary AGI/PER/END to stack a few more QoL perks.
---
Level 26, started on day 1 (lost out on like 3,000 score due to the being online when challenges reset bug tho)
---
Gee kid, I'm sorry your mom dresses you funny.
---
Just mod the headlamp at an armor workbench!  You specifically need a mining helmet for it, other similar ones like the miner hat or hardhat won‚Äôt work.
---
Only reason I knew about it was because it was available in FO4, learned about it there and tried in 76 and found the same options available.
---
What fix / change have they ever implemented for anything that hasnt been the most lazy effortless way lol?
---
Again, you now seriously need to up your comprehension and reasoning game if you cannot see the fallacy in your posts, and think I am repeating what you said. It is a quote. (Quote marks, ever seen them?) Nothing involving caps is pay to win until Bethesda starts selling caps. He is not asking to throw atoms into the sink. Can you recognise logic or reason yet?
---
Any of the areas with lots of buildings and along the roads. If you make it to the last few circles they usually spawn on you.
---
If you‚Äôre launching in Flatwoods I highly suggest going to the relay tower there, after a little while some mutant hounds will usually spawn (I‚Äôve gotten up to 6 there before).
---
I sell everything for 76 caps, regardless.
---
Same here.
---
i can, gt is AsazyCat
---
ok
---
The longer you survive more creatures gonna spawn
---
Can you mod t-51b instead?
---
Almost certainly yes. Steam and Bethesda accounts currently play together.
---
How it usually goes:
---
right when you capture a workshop and build a fusion generator and resources start collecting, you come back to get said resources after 30 minutes and the dreaded

I've had similar problems, maybe not as bad though. The connection is very fickle. You've probably seen Bethesda's official help [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44851/~/what-do-i-do-if-fallout-76-on-pc-is-having-connection-issues%3F). In addition, try running resource monitor and looking under the network usage tab while FO76 is running. See what other programs are competing for bandwidth, and try to disable or force them to shut down (right-click, end process) if they are not essential.  Two I got rid of that seemed to help were 'GameBarPresenceWriter.exe' (an Xbox app that can be disabled under settings &gt; gaming, but this .exe still runs even when disabled - I have to shut it down manually each time I boot up FO76) and two Nvidia overlay processes (can be disabled through GeForce Experience). Along with the port forwarding mentioned at the end of Bethesda's official help, my connection issues are not perfect but have improved.
---
It's just the ones with rads are used for brain bombs which boost intelligence by 7.5 with herbivore and strange in numbers. That's a lot of extra xp gain.
---
Im curious what happened to the secret service after 200 years, figure they be a big faction honestly lol.
---
Apparently stuff is getting lost due to dupers.. idk  I'm already getting shit off everyone for that post. I apologise.
---
sure, no prob
---
Damn 2 of y‚Äôall in a row, it‚Äôs just some satire.
---
Isn't that just Bethesda people complain they have to play NW and  the tasks take too long so they triple the amount you have to do for the same score.
---
Ohh nice Pristine versions of all of them. Where can I loot these for my displays?
---
That's never gonna happen. It was a limited time bundle only for an event.
---
Alright cool. I may just do a solo game and hide until the end
---
This sub doesn‚Äôt allow for bartering or setting of exchange deals. I recommend you find the subs that do allow for that.
---
New any gun glitch
---
You can indeed. I swapped Beckett for Sofia earlier and she gave me the weapon mission. 
---
I bought it back and it was a two star lead pipe. So I broke up with her, scrapped the marital bed and made her wear the witches outfit. 
---
Now she‚Äôs single, sad, can‚Äôt even leave AND out of season in her dress sense. 
---
That‚Äôll teach her good for sending me after everyday items I have to pay 60 caps to travel to.
---
Leave
---
Pretty sure its intended by them. They even changed it with Wastelanders so it's even more white. I do wish the fires gave off the fire glow though.
---
Maybe if you didn‚Äôt waste your life being a whiny bitch over something so trivial? Maybe if you grew up and realized a company that makes video games is only doing it for the money?
---
I just bought this as soon as I saw it in the shop. Thanks though as that may help other players
---
&gt;This sub doesn‚Äôt allow for bartering or setting of exchange deals. I recommend you find the subs that do allow for that.
---
 Is this an unfair deal?
---
THEY'RE DOING WHAT!??!!
---
Good to know. I have been running carnivore for awhile but with the recent buffs to XP gain with the new public group system I‚Äôve been thinking about switching. I have a herbivore serum sitting in my stash waiting. Getting the extra bonus with cranberry relish will be nice.
---
So OP made it in 81 hours to SCORE rank 100 and you take 10 hours to catch up on 6K exp? Weird. Must be you, i guess
---
you should be able to acquire a 1 star bloodied handmade for cheap or trade for combat rifle or assault rifle.  Most of your dmg will come from the bloodied prefix over the secondary ones. It‚Äôs been awhile but I bought a 1* hm for 3-5k caps
---
My main is bloodied and I use both a handmade and combat rifle, just to switch it up and also use the 45 I acquire. 
---
If you use the 50 cal you‚Äôll be missing out on the extra dmg from commando.
---
I know! I thought video games were a public service!

Oh I had sofias and she sent me to kill a robot rain, deleted her console then put it back then she sent me for a weaoon case. Got a black powder pistol, im about to break up with her now too üòí
---
The secret service "faction"  is such a poorly thought out element of the game. They did such a great job leading up to their story line but once you beat that vault, they do nothing with the faction. Just a group of boring NPCs sitting in an inconvenient interior cell. The pack of quests through them is baffling and the justification for gold bullion is painfully dumb writing.
---
I think I've sold like 5 or 6 BOS armor paints and a dozen or so under armor plans.  No elder paint yet.
---
No, get it the game itself is very fun and the community is awesome too you‚Äôll like it here.
---
Okay. Or get this. How about........... picking cards OUTSIDE OF A TIME LIMIT BEFORE THE GAME? 
---
what a concept. Huh?
---
Maybe this will help:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7tb75/chart\_vendor\_sell\_prices\_vs\_charisma\_and\_hard/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7tb75/chart_vendor_sell_prices_vs_charisma_and_hard/)
---
Obviously if there are enough people taking out AoE weapons that you felt the need to make a post, it's more than one or two.  
---
And you're still arguing that people are "exploiting wrong"
---
You can also sell off the extras to the vendors, but do that after you complete the event. Hope support helps you get the issue resolved. I've been trying to get the BOS paints for over a year...no luck at all.
---
It's that my counter is stuck at 3/5 I don't remember what the three where ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs too late
---
No, must be him, what he did is not Healthy or advisable... Its borderline insane and self destructive
---
The conclusion of these maths was "you're barely able to reach rank 100", which is only true, if you dont calculate natural XP / Score. So the conclusion is just plain dumb.
---
They should just get ride of everything, and when you log in, you go to a machine that allows you to buy what you want based in caps you‚Äôve earned.
---
What economy?
---
Everything is now traded for other items anyway
---
and we all know that the Gold is not going to do jack shit in the future like making a new currency as all caps are backed by water and Gold-backed currency doesn't show up in 3 or 4
---
The fireproof perk reduces damage by 75%, so it may be partly that?
---
OK thanks I'll go check, I'm misunderstanding this I know.
---
Three. Characters?  What the fuck.
---
It does seems like it. Its kinda odd they would change it from 3 creatures which is achievable to 9 which could easily take a few hours of gameplay.
---
It can just be applied, no need for the plan. But what makes it so good on a flamer barrel, since it reduces damage and it‚Äôs positive effect almost never comes into play?
---
I hope they're done with bullion. You get it from public events and some quests. That's good enough for the future.
---
Challenges and quests, it's the nomenclature that is making my head spin.
---
Yes duper arnt hackers
---
you just have a poor understanding of what is happening. the current duping method has zero to do with anyone else's inventory. the only items that can be lost with this method are the duper's own items.
---
Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.
---
Do events actually give score now?
---
reading all this i fear progress in this game will come to a GRINDING halt for a lot of casual players. we will see in september...
---
Idk about being more complicated, but definitely not suited to FO76s scrap system. Gunpowder is already in FO76 so that's something that doesnt need to be added, but instead of scrapping ammo for the same casing type and its components like in NV make it so you can scrap them into their current crafting components so you can reuse the scrap. Most if not all ballistic ammo uses lead, and shotgun shells take plastic and lead scrap which is 2 of the 3 components for fusion cells, 5mm takes steel which is another component of arrows (which I'm sorry but I use a bow and before I even took scrounger I was finding so many arrows, at least 5-9 per container ammo container, that i have been tossing them) and syringer ammo takes plastic as well and is very common and not very useful, scrapping them into their base scrap would still be enough to offset the effort of collecting other scrap and since you cant even sell ammo to vendors but only the ammo converter you could take that scrap and put it towards repairing or crafting other items. I agree the NV system is a terrible idea to try and implement into 76 but being able to scrap ammo into their base scrap components would be a lot more sensible then using an entire extra system like the ammo converter instead of the scrap system that's already in the game.
---
Thanks, I may be looking at the wrong thing, I swear this is so damn confusing.
---
I haven't had *tons* of freezes or crashes.  What I've had, is getting stuck on furniture; getting disconnected from server (sometimes leaving a lot of scrap behind); falling through the ground and teleporting back above ground to fall to my death unless I'm wearing PA; being unable to kill enemies;  or even clearly killing enemies/players on my screen only for me to find out a few seconds later NOPE they killed me instead; rubber-band-teleporting backwards several meters, most commonly shortly after entering an area; daily and weekly challenges auto-completing before they should and I have no idea if I lost SCORE; and...
---
Oh, I could probably go on forever, I should really stop.
---
I agree. I really liked the wayward but i have no reason to really go there now especially with the extra loading screen just to sell stuff.
---
Safe from dupers? I don't understand the question. How are dupers gonna get your stuff?
---
My main is melee so I don't use explosive weapons and don't typically use fireproof.  Never needed it
---
No option to buy on Bethesda.net?
---
Mule is a good option
---
The discount is almost good enough but she doesn't sell anything worthwhile
---
I haven't had a crash in months. But yes, that's about my reaction.
---
Correct.
---
Because otherwise anyone would just stockpile on the weak ammos and mass produce the big stuff right from level 1.
---
Also depending on the primer combo you could actually self convert some ammos if you had the cases. 5.56 and 5mm for example by default are practically interchangeable (really helps when stockpiling to fuel NV's kickass minigun) and the large pistols (10mm, .45 auto, .44) were also interchangable as long as you had the cases (which you got just by shooting or picking from vendors).
---
The conversion recipies for energy ammo were also very handy once you were able to source Fission Batteries (1 of those plus 5 drained SEC = 25 SEC which can be made into whatever) and ECP (stuff drops and is sold in droves).
---
I have that in the queue, thanks I'll go do that one and see what happens.
---
I just completed the 5 mutagenetic waste and box of paper targets, dross toss, these did not count to the daily challenges?
---
Yea true
---
what's the bug?
---
My favorite was encountering moth man or whoever for the first time randomly - and spending every bullet and weapon I had to take it down for like 20 minutes - only for its corpse to fall under the map so I couldn‚Äôt loot it.
---
Well... yes, but if you're going to the lengths to make use of unyielding you might as well use the other low-health advantages available to you tbh.
---
Me: gives machine 1000 buffout
---
Machine: enjoy your 1 bufftat
---
Demo Expert, grenadier, chems and head shots. You can hit a person with no armor in the body and almost one shot them without any of that. They do as much damage as a scoped lever. They are underrated. I've won several fights with it when I spawned near other players.
---
 First desk i checked in the military wing had one
---
Or when a camp turret gets destroyed and disappears when I "repair all" but it still counts towards my budget..   or when I can't exit my PA even when standing on the most level of surfaces.  I've had more issues since the Legendary Run update than ever before.
---
Its a tie for me, Free Range, Heart of the Swamp and Awol Armaments.  Free Range is great as I am guaranteed high level weapons, and sometimes 2-5 (ran into 3 legendary sting wings, 2 blotflies, 1 glowing Yao Guai, and 2 sheepsquatch at just 1 event on Tuesday).  Heart of the swamp normally gives me 1-3 max level legendaries, and Awol Armaments is guaranteed 1, normally with 2 or 3.  Plus each of these events can be completed fairly fast with no actual timer.
---
So why do we have to rely on an extra machine in our camp instead of being able to use the tinker's workbench which is already used to craft ammo, to scrap ammo into its base scrap components for reuse?
---
Often!
---
I can't get any further with the questline. I get stuck in the conversation and have to completely close the game to get out of it
---
they're "working on a fix" but haven't said anything beyond that or about what they are going to do to make it up to players affected.
---
&gt; And before the "not everyone deserves every reward crowd" sticks their brown nose in here, this is not normal.  
---
Take my upvote.  I'm still laughing at that.
---
Quick question can we actually get the drum barrel plan or is the plan not in the game at all?
---
Like they took the worst parts out of the floundered MMO industry and added them to an RPG game with few to none of the positive parts..
---
Like, after you press a dialogue option, it just hangs there and doesn't advance to the next dialogue or set of responses?
---
Just to clarify:
---
Gold Star: Complete a daily challenge.
---
Stuck at 3/5
---
Boiled scorchbeast brains has the same effect for carnivore.
---
Edit: tasty squirrel stew does the xp for carni too.
---
I‚Äôm the one that needs to grow up when you‚Äôre the one that can‚Äôt take a joke. üëå makes sense
---
Personally I don't mind NW. I think its a game mode with way better PVP options than adventure mode. The challenges are also one and done, with them being very easy to do provided you know where to drop. 
---
HOWEVER, the load time for that game mode is insane! I spend almost 8-10 full minutes in a lobby before the NW match begins. Bethesda needs to lower this time or lower the number of players per NW match, it's crazy to play 2 matches you have to wait almost 20 minutes total.
---
(Happened yesterday)
---
There was a group of sups with their behemoth wandering about. Not looking for a fight I kept my distance, though never let them leave my sight. Just as I'm about to turn and leave I notice someone who seems fairly inexperienced headed right for them (lvl38). As he grabbed their attention I decided the biggest one must go first. With a sneaky shot from my Lever gun the behemoth was on me, and after a hard fought battle expending many rounds from my AK, the brute and his friends were dead. The man thanked me as he came from behind his cover, and asked if I wanted to tag along. I declined, but warned him that he should stick near white springs until he has a better grasp on this desolate place
---
Yes. It's sat there for 10 minutes before closing it down.
---
sell them. I buy legendaries to scrap if they're cheap enough to. i got 4 alts to feed
---
It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs a formula they unintentionally put into place by now. Release something (no one asked for) with humongous bugs and poor reception, fix very small things about it, then put the next thing out without fixing the original problems. Then the new thing bugs with the last thing. Then a bug comes up that was fixed, but is worse than before. Repeats eternally. It just upsets me that their poor programing and content is putting people out of real money, constantly and continuously. Every day, every hour, someone is losing something because of some bug with this game. I love the game, and given more attention to quality control, this would be a huge hit game. The weirdness is just playing a game, and literally having to deal with the company behind it personally to make sure your game actually works even half proper.
---
I read that you log in... and most of your stuff on display ( not in stash ) has gone. I've recently been told that that's not true.  My apologies.
---
Dupe glitch going around again
---
*‚ÄúOh for fuck‚Äôs sake! How the fuck was that a back stab!? Roll! Roll! Roll! Take a sippy! Parry this +15 Zweihander, you backflippin‚Äô bitch!‚Äù*
---
Average Darkroot Garden encounters.
---
Or, you know, recognize that "Chems" are just processed chemicals that can undergo further chemical processes to become other processed chemicals. I'm not saying it'd be a straight up 1 for 1 trade. I fully expect there to be spoilage, just like in the Ammo Converter. But, none the less, it'd be nice if we had some method of converting unwanted Chems into desired Chems.
---
That sucks you are getting shit. I was not looking to give you shit. I was going to let you know your stuff is safe this is not an inventory steal glitch or any like that. Like the other response said you cant lose anything only people attempting the dupe.
---
It‚Äôs annoying because I‚Äôve been playing hard trying to get as far as I can and I feel like this is going to hold me back. I have to hit that repeatable so many times now just to make up what I‚Äôve lost.
---
Did you try pressing B to back out of the convo and restart it?
---
I have this problem with Boomer almost every time I get his daily and I have to engage and back out of the conversation a few times to get it to finally go through and give me additional options. Maybe that's what's happening here?
---
as im sure other posters will state, I am so over it. i dont know whats a glitch or a feature anymore. i swear, hand to the man i thought i just had a dope ass legendary minigun where all my carried ammo was loaded into the "mag". it was like that for THREE DAYS. turns out that was a glitch, a carryover from fo4 (the endless perk). do yourself a favor, just stop playing fo76 for a few days, play anything else. if you can come back to fo76 and still be \*excited\* to play, you got issues that need to be addressed before your spouse starts breaking dishes and blaming you for making them hit you in the face.
---
Right. It was a joke. Can you point out the part that was the funny part? I mean seriously, none of it comes across as funny.
---
Was it that part over there?
---
I put out a request on the FO76 marketplace. I definitely wanna get my hands on one soon.
---
My game really doesn't crash very often, but I have a high end pc too. In 600 hours playtime it's crashed maybe 5 times. That's not too bad.
---
They need to put a good chunk of grey matter into making PA viable again in every aspect of the game. But there are some simple things they could do that will probably occupy a single dev for a day (and testers for a week) to make PA at least bearable. I still have my PA on me, but I almost never use it because it feels like putting chains on myself, and it's just no fun using it.
---
And I still don't understand the stupid weight system for PA - having it on you is 10 pounds, equipping it the pieces for some stupid reason weigh a lot more. Couple this with a few lost weight reduction legendaries and I jump up from 385/405 to 570/430 or something. It's just fucking incomprehensible why you can basically carry less by stepping into something that's supposed to make you a walking tank. Or rather, an exoskeleton that should support your fragile, weak body...
---
That being said, a simple increase of carry weight like you suggested might be an alternate way to approach the problem. I'm not sure what value would be appropriate, but PA pieces should weigh 0 for a start. Then, maybe 100 up to even 200 for a vanilla PA and +100 for calibrated shocks and +100 for excavator may be appropriate to counteract the mods and stars you're losing on your armor/backpack.
---
The new dupe glitch is connected to the npc vendor bots somehow. You can not sell plans for them. That is from a different glitch.
---
I appreciate the insight! I'll definitely have to dive into this and rearrange my special.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Then I have a poor understanding. My sincere apologies.
---
Food build
---
Try no mans sky. It‚Äôs gotten good lately and just went free to play with game pass
---
Some of the planets are nuclear üôÇ
---
Lol, hopefully the conversion rate would be a bit better than that.
---
It‚Äôs not like chems are do hard to get in the game. Most of my caps is made off of you junkies.
---
Do both sides until you reach their respective "Siding With" quest.  Then make your choice.
---
This maximizes the reputation you get from the quests, and makes sure you get the Chinese Stealth Suit for free from the Settlers.
---
Instead of creating a fun multiplayer fallout sandbox that has a limited amount of good content, they've decided to squeeze out a few more bucks by creating artificially long content so they can boast about "player engagement" in their "MMO" (text chat not included)
---
They can fool people once but, the inability to turn this game around even with an engaged player base is remarkably pathetic. All they had to do was invest in this game a bit. Not selling us shit, the game!
---
Very true good point!
---
Lol you're leaving the day dupes go wild.  Guns and armor galore!
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
My lowest point I remember was trying to launch a nuke early on. The first attempt, the game crashed halfway through the silo. Annoyed but undeterred, I went in a second time and at the very last section the robots glitched out for launch prep and the bar froze. Instead of just closing the game and doing something else like I should've, I went in yet again and actually managed to launch the nuke. Then someone with some crazy modded weapon killed the SBQ about 3 seconds after spawn and all I got was a combat armor piece out of the whole ordeal.
---
Why shouldn't we buy anything? Cause it might be duped?
---
So what?
---
Thank you my friend. That reply meant a lot.
---
Exactly. It's really stupid writing. I generally don't care if things in these games are lore-breaking. It's the god-awful high school level writing that drives me up a wall.
---
Yeah i don‚Äôt feed trolls. Still no reason to be a cunt tho.
---
Referring to buying in game from players, like trading weapons or buying for caps, if someone offered you a B2525 fixer for 30 of your amazing weapons when their duped lol
---
Nobody plays NW on ps4 in my time zone so even if I wanted to play this mess, I can't! I hope you can still get rank 100 without NW challenges. At first I thought the dailies were ok but weekly NW challenges is really annoying.
---
The longer you survive, the more creatures will spawn. I was able to get all nine in one round and I never play NW lol. I just stuck to the foresty areas and spammed the vats button. I would hide in bushes in case there was someone nearby. Also if you see the a big red diamond on your radar, that's a creature
---
thank you very much for the link. Pretty handy
---
I feel your pain man. Happened to me day before yesterday. Out 4500 SCORE, 3000 of that being from weeklies. 
---
I've been on here bitching like a broken record but it's been no use. Can't even get a post about it to get over 100 upvotes. Submit a ticket with Bethesda if you haven't already.
---
They need to make this right. Not just by fixing the issue but compensating those affected. With a system that requires you to pretty much play every single day of the season to get everything, it's absolutely going to hold us back and force us to grind harder than others, or spend more money. It's fucked up.
---
I get the OCCASIONAL crash to desktop so I can't sympathize with all the complaints.
---
Then again, I have a stable system that is always up to date and has anti-virus so...
---
There's several in the Forest. Got mine to do that task from Lewis and Sons Farming Supply, near the Nuka Cola plant. Low levels can easily do it.
---
No need to apologize, man. Just trying to explain why everyone is lashing out. Not that their shit attitudes are warranted.
---
Rust's playerbase is more toxic than standing in a nuclear drop site.
---
Aha _and like that he walked off into the sunset, never to be seen again_
---
This is why I enjoy F76 so much lol
---
Here's a hint.
---
It ain't a 50 cal hunting rifle.
---
Yep, and nothing happened. I could look around the area, so the screen wasn't frozen. My character may end up being the mule for my fiance and I as I am camped near water and have a farm.
---
Agreed it‚Äôs weird how the separate pa pieces weigh more but once on a pa frame everything only weighs 10 pounds total but I‚Äôm not gonna complain about that cause it actually saves weight since it only counts the chassis weight lol
---
Frog legs is pretty easy to get 
---
I don't even use it much because there is no such thing as a small jump. And every massive leap to get over a tiny pebble gives away your position 
---
I guess it can totally be worth it in urban situations like downtown Morgantown or the various cliffs all over, but I just cant stand it. Even though I would be so severely annoyed without it in adventure
---
It could be the level, your like after you pass level 100 it takes forever to level up
---
You‚Äôre the troll here.
---
Damn. Well I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. Submit a ticket with Bethesda just in case.
---
Good luck
---
When I first claimed it did show up. I logged back in the next day to see if I would start earning treasury notes for completing public events and the gold bullion was gone. I have only been playing with my main character since the legendary run was released.
---
Todays nuclear winter challenge was kill 9 creatures. Dude, i have been playing for a month and i could swear i have seen 15 creatures max. Its infuriating how they got from kill 3 to kill 9 in a such a short amount of time.
---
Legendary perks were changed because they were God awful and useless.
---
It's a reward for doing the settlers' vault raid. Not sure why it pops up like a legendary though.
---
I don't see the reasoning with the ammo convertor not being considered for endgame users.  When most additions seem to be content locks on end game content.  
---
I'm happy they are changing it.  But I'm not sure why they thought the community would like this method of button bashing.  Or how just one test run in PA would see it bugs out.
---
At least dogfood your own product.  That being said I'm glad they are modifying the amounts.
---
It really only affects player trading since the in game economy is as barebones as it comes. 
---
Turning off vendor bots is silly.
---
I'm not sure! I know I was able to find it on Xbox and PS stores, and there was an option to buy a PC bundle through the Xbox store, but I have absolutely no idea if that works with [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net).
---
Thank you for your input, it's much appreciated. I am submitting a ticket now. Just waiting for the video to upload
---
Thanks!  I have completed the overseers quests to the point where I have to talk to each sides.  I though that is where I had to wait to pick a side. 
---
Thanks for the link to the walk through!
---
Yeah i agree but i'm just saying that i simply expect the worst when it comes to Fo76 and new mechanics implementation. Fingers crossed that i'm proved wrong.
---
You nailed it 100%.
---
Factor in things like the Legendary Run which will award perk cards outside of level ups, as well as the new teaming feature which has accelerated level up frequency (at least in my experience so far). I think the bar is set cautiously high so that they can add things like the "Legendary Run" without having to worry that it is going to invalidate a system that is largely being added to give playing incentive beyond level 50.
---
I do think that level ups should award a perk coin by themselves, and then turning in your perk cards would be a separated system from that; It would help you feel like you're always working towards your Legendary Perk card without making you feel like you can't experiment with new builds or add more utility to your perk loadouts.  
---
This Dev team feels slow to respond &amp; at times a little disconnected, but they \*did\* just pull the system to add more variety and address key things people wanted from the system. It's... kind of insane that it took them over a year to add something like "Master Infiltrator" into the game to address a really key "ease of use" issue, but I want to give them credit in that they do seem to be trying to listen to us (like, now, at least).
---
I am on PC. One thing I forgot was the Sandman perk that gives a bonus for suppressed weapons at night. I swap that in for sneak when applicable. Just remember to bring a tagging weapon to other events so you don't one shot legendary enemies. Bloodied stealth makes it pretty easy to do that.
---
people like you are why every gaming company has turned to shit. Boolickers that just drink the koolaid and buy all the microtransactions and don‚Äôt say anything about the cheap, poor-taste tactics that every developer has resorted to in order to fill that bottom line more. You‚Äôre doing god‚Äôs work üëç
---
Lmaoo you‚Äôre a salty little clown boy huh? Go get your squeaky red nose
---
Sheepish? lol Why don't you ditch the damage perks then and go with a 2 handed weilding sniper build if you want to be "unique",
---
I just finished this one. Entered solo with Fill Team off.  Got the Flatwoods map, spawned at Wade airport I think it is and snuck my way to Sutton. Picked up all 9 by the time I reached the Overseers house.
---
Happened to me too on PS4 last night, two guys dropped me over a hundred plans along with junk, alcohol, stims etc. I was a bit worried to take it but I did üò¨
---
I find a lot of lower trees that could be accessible...vast majority of players never look up. I've used the obstacle course in the hills a few times - go up and about 2/3 of the way through it and just duck and cover. I've had a whole team wandering around under me as it was in repeated safe zones and at no point did anyone think to just look up at me.
---
Same here, tried a couple of fixes found on the reddit and nothing seems to work.
---
You‚Äôve put the version of it they give you for your camp at rank 100 to shame. Well done!
---
There's a locked safe at that golf course on the morgantown map, in the south. It's behind the front desk. Not many people seem to spawn in there either so if you want to try to play after there's plenty of loot laying around.
---
I appreciate all your advice! I'm definitely going to be playing around with it quite a bit.
---
Once you return it. And next time ASK to borrow it.
---
I was using a different character back then that was shotgun only. I started my melee one about 3 months ago, so yes, I completely missed that üò•
---
Man, sure wish I hadn‚Äôt grinded so hard for them when they came out.
---
That glowing skeleton costume was a bitch the first time around.
---
This happened to me the other night.  So I am out of ammo/running low.  I have the lead so I just need the acid and the steal.  I go and get the two locations I need. One of which was unowned but fully deck out (sweet).  
---
I start hopping in events because I still have sub-optimal gear.
---
I finally get in an event with a legendary spawn.  Spawn dies and game crashes before looting.  So I miss out on the legendary and my good luck at the already decked out acid farm.
---
The bundle is meh imo. I don't even particularly like Piper's outfit.
---
God, I would have such an urge to drop a grenade and open fire 
---
I'm trying that in 103 games when Flatwoods miraculously gets voted in
---
60 caps for 15 scrip isn‚Äôt bad
---
Unfortunately having the same issue. No word from Beth yet?
---
A-hah! Thought you could fool us with this phake redit post, Dr Zarbo!
---
I'm on the fence myself. Right now encounters  give you like, a higher level mob than you, maybe crowned or legendary, but a bunch of lower level trash mobs with it. With OW, all those mobs will be at my level. Sounds like it will be a tougher fight.
---
I prefer 76 over FO4...
---
You already can trade them for random loot in certain encounters... you even can get gauss rifles for them, somehow.
---
OMG I have 2 more levels to go yet to max out my rep :(. Ok I‚Äôm going to move both quest lines forward and split the gold.  I can earn more gold faster. I also read that I can buy some as well from an npc at the wayward as well.   Seems like I‚Äôm close to max caps all the time.  Been buying power armor plans (only thing I have left to buy with caps).
---
If it‚Äôs not the scorched heart event, it‚Äôs all good but what rlly does pisses me off is if I disconnect while having a workshop active tryna get resources
---
Thanks bought it off some one for my collection lol
---
You would probably be better off upgrading your cpu rather than your GPU if you want a real performance increase in this game. I have a i7 9700k and it uses at least 65 percent cpu with this game. Sometimes more.
---
I want a water exchanger - 100 Purified for 1 Boiled, at least then I can do cooking at a random desert spot.
---
Its 15 et and still showing full price, wtf
---
29
---
I haven't seen one, but it is on Steam.
---
I get a little frustrated, particularly if I have a lot of stuff onboard and haven't gotten back to my camp to offload yet, because inevitably it'll be 'lost' (doubly so if I've been killed and haven't recovered my loot bag yet).
---
My crash experiences though are few and far between - not zero percent, but not a daily occurrence. I don't get BSODs and very few CTDs. What I'm experiencing is, I think, a memory leak of some sort - it almost seems like the game is actually overwriting memory reserved for other software. Sometimes the game will crash and bring down an unrelated piece of software that I have running (which complains of unexpected memory access/corruption). Other times the game will crash the entire video card driver set, at which point I need to reboot the PC in order to get back from "generic MS display driver".
---
Happens all the time.  You get used to it...
---
Glad u enjoyed it, it's not the best fallout, but I still enjoy playing it and my friends do to, that's all that matters
---
FYI you can vats them so that may help you find them
---
Yes it‚Äôs awful and doubt they‚Äôll fix it.
---
Gotcha, haven't been on yet today.
---
I believe it‚Äôs a very specific bug. I‚Äôve spoken to a couple of others that have the same issue. No sure what causes it to happen but it‚Äôs most definitely a bug. Just waiting for Bethesda to chime in.
---
Man (or woman) I been playing since BETA. Day one this game ate our game files and half the pc players had to re download the game which took all night as Beth capped the download speed and we were all like really bummed out until the next time the Beta was live and Beth gave us a bunch of extra beta hours to make up for it . The game has been like that the whole way through. 
---
The other day I had a damn BLAST playing though. I was solo, and saw 'Back on the BEat' or whatever pop up and I ran over to do it because of the SCORE rewards. Buncha randos showed up and we had a great time. 
---
Then a SBQ fight that went really well and lots of score points for that and it was great so.. things are looking up slightly
---
I‚Äôm going to the vault as well after my daily‚Äôs are done. The NW challenges kill me.  I‚Äôm awful at it and I don‚Äôt have any good perk cards to help out.  Took me 6 tries to find 3 things to unlock for yesterday‚Äôs challenge.
---

---
yeah for sure, it kinda fills two niches at once. i prefer solo games but my friends got me back into this one lol
---
To be honest, I'm used to it because every Bethesda games I played so far had this problem. Fallout since 3 to 76, The Elder Scrolls since Morrowind to Skyrim...
---
Hey I spent my 1k scrip and it‚Äôs purely visual. Good luck.
---
I‚Äôd been using the canned stew since I do Feed the People every time it comes up. I have a nice stack sitting in my stash. I‚Äôll look into the squirrel stew as well.
---
I'd like to see a non-yellow variant, definitely.  But the "Candy Claws" that was released over Christmas is the only one that I'm aware of.
---
Mouth harps make me laugh my ass off every time I hear them. Don‚Äôt quite know why I find them SO damned funny. When I found a playable mouth harp for the first time, here in 76, I swear I almost had a heart attack laughing so hard. I would LOVE to have one in my C.A.M.P.
---
Thanks for this mate, got a decent idea for a new camp now
---
Yeah same the whole thing is very meh imo and it was just like, we‚Äôre really gonna bring FO4 characters into these bundles now?
---
It's a bug. AFAIR if you have died in NW near the edge and then returned to normal mode, boundaries are removed
---
Are you able to place your camp or survival tent in this area beyond?
---
I found a bag full of about 200 superstimpaks,  grabbed them, then realised that they were probably duped, so swam to the bottom of the deepest lake in watoga and dumped them all, then logged off.
---
I am. God also told me to tell you to cram it, with walnuts, ugly.
---
The ammo machine (Tumbler) looks like they intended you to just throw ammo in it and get ammo out. Guessing they couldnt get it to work right so they threw on the Terminal and called it a day. The damn thing even spins when you interact with it.
---
any furious levers with vats vats?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that. My friends that are all over 200 as well say they still get them.
---
The grind is absolutely ridiculous. 
---
But being punished for swapping specials instead of choosing perks is somehow even dumber than that. So instead of an insane grind, you get insane grind AND cheated out of coins for any respec you‚Äôve done to your character. It‚Äôs the same levels being achieved. Just use the levels ffs.  The number of levels gets you X amount of coins. This isn‚Äôt even a hard one. 
---
Scrapping perk cards? Who‚Äôs dumbass idea was this?
---
i know how to spell, I just won't go on settings to disable, takes to long to find
---
Yeah im just hoarding legendary modules (they have no limit right?)  No point in adding more rng than i need too.
---
I don't play for 3 weeks, log on, doing stuff then nuke gets dropped. I go, fighting queen and near dead.. then game crashes. I go "welp there's that" and realize why I didn't log in for so long. The loading of game and every fast travel is so long. Half time playing is sitting staring at my screen.
---
Thank you! Grinding for that final jacket and then I am done.
---
;_; that one hurt
---
And so much for this all being a joke. LOL. Sure did get under your skin, you whiny little troll. Now I'm going to buy that just because it makes you sooooo mad! Woooo I can see you shaking your fists at the screen!
---
Yep, could have the "scrap cards for points" on top of the every 50 levels to gain additional legendary cards
---
Agreed. There's no way that anyone who has actually spent time with this game would think that the way this works is acceptable. Even more so for legendary perks. I'm on console, so I haven't checked out the PTS but from everything that I have read about how it works, it is an impossible grind and the way you turn in cards actually punishes players that like to change their build and swap perks around.
---
Thank you so much for the reply! I am at work so I was worried it was patched by the time I got home.
---
So you can buy with discount? Thx gonna try
---
And now with all the new XP buffing effects of lunchboxes and public groups, leveling is super quick. I‚Äôll get 3-5 levels per session. When I get to the last 1/4 of the XP bar a West Tek run will level me up.
---
LOL - yeah I didn't trust my luck against a group with so many bad encounters so I waited until they wandered off. But I know most players get target locked and always look where they're moving. I've hidden right beside players simply by ducking in a shadow, but the biggest mistake players make is not looking up (that's also the most common joke for table top RPG players, when you enter a room LOOK UP!), so it's easy to hide if you can just get up out of the immediate line of sight and not move. There are a ton of wrecked structures etc. that work, but that obstacle course is perfect, especially if you move along it a bit.
---
I can confirm it's only been the last two to three days though.
---
The satirical nature of the post was meant to be funny. The underlying theme of bitching about scummy cheap money grubbing tactics by this company was not a joke.
---
I do this event every time it comes on and I have never seen anybody cheat so your argument is full of holes.
---
Don't be a scumbag cheater.
---
I'd like more of a glow too, I've put them around my lake hoping for nice reflections in the water but they just look a bit cold.
---
Also, Bethesda needs to legitimize this glitch and make a "Christmas/Halloween in July" and let players catch up on the previous years events. Would be hilarious to make it official, and beneficial for those who couldn't grind during those holidays. Ha!
---
Ouch man. I only lost 750. If I lost that much I may walk away from the damn game. Did it only happen to you once so far? Should I be worried each day now?
---
Yah, I tried on my alt to be safe and it took 75. So it‚Äôs safe. This is PS4 btw. Not sure about the others.
---
Yeah I thought it was just a bug in this system, I took all the stuff in it but now I know its a dupe I won't take it if I see it again just to be safe
---
100% agree. That part was a good change its just that nothing came with it to offset the loss on an already insane system.
---
Might be. Believe it gives it a yellow glow?
---
For instance, if you buy a cosmetic for your camp, and then later that week they release a bundle of 3 items, one or two being something you already purchased, do you not think you should get a discount on said bundle? That‚Äôs the other one thats been eating at me
---
You forgot Overseer tickets (Nuclear Winter)
---
so... uhh... I wasn't supposed to wipe out that camp?
---
Dude it‚Äôs ridiculous and none of their solutions are working. What a shitshow.
---
But then my idea would allow them to reroll a weekly and daily that are from adventure mode for a chance at a NW challenge instead
---
" Other RPGs have NOWHERE near this amount of grind for basic character upgrades..." 
---
Legendary perk cards are basic character upgrades? Nothing in a game is legendary if they're easy to get and everyone has them. Legendary, to me, would imply unique, rare, sometimes one of a kind, so they should be incredibly difficult to get. JMHO
---
For some reason, they‚Äôre incredibly finicky about floors. I had to fiddle with mine by moving and removing floors around and under the bar pieces to get them properly snapped, it took ages.
---
Nope. At least not the tent, I didn't try with my C.A.M.P because I didn't want to lose my location.
---
Yeah, it failed to be funny. Because there's nothing in it that is satirical. It's just bitchy.
---
I mean the chair is still there haha
---
I like "one violent night" when assholes actually play the damn instruments and dont get pissy and all angry face when the time runs out as not enough  noise was made to summon the monster.
---
Thanks!!! I've been searching for this and never found help until now
---
Hahah Yeah, I hate when the game crashes in a crucial moment, I remember fighting a 3 star Legendary Wendigo, I almost spend all my ammo in that mother f*
---
And just a second before I kill him the game crashes... such waste of time, ammo and life üòñ
---
Wait, you‚Äôre telling me that winning....that winning isn‚Äôt the main objective? This is gonna make me look at every game differently now.
---
I find it really amusing to think that the computer interface being used since the 20th century in the Fallout universe might finally get some updated user interface after over a century because "Appalachia's Best and Brightest" needed to shoot people more efficiently.
---
dang okay thanks for letting me know
---
I've got Appalachia radio at my camp. There are at least two choices when building the radio, one for classical and one for Appalachia radio.
---
Definitely agree. And thank you for the words :) Happy Wastelanding
---
Dont waste scrip for 3 star weapons mate, only 2 prefixes are important, you will never get reduced weight anyway lol (armor worth 3 star tho)
---
Plus, it's basically a copy of Seen This Before from the Ordinator Perk overhaul for Skyrim. Of course it's a legendary perk, Enai Siaion already did it! üòÜ
---
You're welcome :)
---
That's a good one, it's a real battle
---
Thank you üòä
---
I find/get awarded lots of Super stims and sell them off to vendors. They aren't really so rare but they are heavy and offer little extra benefit.
---
Cheers!
---
You on gamepass? I bet it's because the game is looking for the Bethesda launcher permission.in the firewall, which of course doesn't exist for game pass... every solution mentions the launcher.
---
I've noticed it the last week, yeah. Lots of lag and bugs that I didn't used to get often.
---
Please don't apologize for playing this game. It's an online game were you can do and go wherever you please.
---
 If that person wanted a solo queen kill they have private servers for that.
---
Totally agree! I experience exactly same thing today. I joined Encrypted event and someone started it already with only 3 people. After that everyone ignore main objective and sheepsquatch was immune almost all the time. And of course we failed the event. Total waste of my stimpacks
---
For example?
---
My game crashes during events. So annoying when you have 27 seconds left them bam.
---
If you're using on older version of Inspector, uninstall it and install the latest version.
---
I finally managed to get the fake Sasquatch one done. Someone else had started it and I made sure to dump my junk and FT to it. This char is only 64 and nowhere near ready for high end solo play. Stealth Sniper and so-so gear.    
---
I died maybe 5 times but respawned close enough. I have more than enough Stimpacks and helped at least 3 people during it. I forgot what I got at the end but sadly not the Fixer plans.    
---
I only do the Events I know I can solo and if in a group follow them around doing them if that's the plan.
---
I got an i7 6700k, don't really think it's bottlenecking my videocard that much.
---
But my idea isn‚Äôt limited to just swapping out NW challenges, it‚Äôs a chance to reroll *whatever challenge you don‚Äôt like*. It‚Äôs simply a way to make the challenges more user friendly
---
But if they didn't add more grindable content, would you bother playing the game? Seems that all the goals would get accomplished and everyone would simply leave. It would be like PACMAN only having one level. What would be the point? You don't HAVE to do them all. I'm level 65 (I know, noob) and haven't even started my bullion dailies yet. Still too much other stuff to do. You can play the game however you want.
---
Yep. I asked my friend if I was still on our team and he said I was gone. A crash out is one thing, but eternal loading is extra annoying.
---
Well when your team mates complete quests you get rewards for it. So you don‚Äôt need to do anything and get rewarded for it.
---
I hear there's a scorchbeast near the end.
---
Yeah I thought about including time frames in the math but there's just too much variation 'time to level' between players.
---
You've got god mode glitch and then full unyielding all int mutations  int grinding machines, and then everything below that. So 'TTL' can be seconds, minutes, 20-30m all the way to people who level maybe a few times a week. Just such a wide spectrum.
---
Seems like this system is geared towards the god mode glitchers lol.
---
It‚Äôs not about missing score, it‚Äôs about making a more user friendly system that requires little to implement
---
One could make a cyber cafe with your idea and the new slocum joe set and vendor.
---
...... how do you not have a choice of whether or not you want to play the game?
---
How did u do it what grind method were u been doing iv been nuking whitesprings and I'm at 34
---
That sucks to hear.    
---
I've been taking pictures of every daily since this all started to make sure when the rollover hit I didn't have the problem. So far I have not.
---
Good luck, that 14k for the fur lined one was a slog!
---
This is kind of ridiculous. None of the challenges are that crazy. In fact I feel the challenges are to simple or boring. 
---
Which of the kinds of challenges are there that you don‚Äôt want to do?
---
I definitely see a lot of AFKers on my events teams.  As long as the team is fully bonded and full and I'm getting my x4 event XP I don't really care.
---
Yup and you can almost find them anywhere and yet gauss rifle is still in orange crates lol............
---
So I assume the answer is 'no way in hell' but...any way for me to load my PS4 toon into my Xbox Game Pass install by logging into Bethesda with the same credentials or something?
---
I am real fed up with the horrible performance of this game on PS4 (insert console slams here). I am not sure if it is the game itself or my HD that runs it may be failing. Constant crashes with the system saying the game file is corrupt, 5 minutes later it runs fine...weapon wheel taking too long to select weapons, SBQ fights coming in at 4fps with an 95% chance it won't give me loot or xp credit for helping kill it, textures loading in 5 minutes after I enter an area (make that textures and the structures themselves being ghosted)... I have Gamepass Ultimate so I am about ready to cut the 'newb-console' fight out of this thing and carry on with either Xbox or PC if they know how to run the game better...
---
Not upgrading my rig, I‚Äôm waiting until the mythical DDR 5 is out. Might be stuck for awhile, but hopefully it‚Äôll be worth it. And from all accounts it will be.
---
Yeah, it's been killing me but hopefully I can get it done by the end of day tomorrow.
---
Made a mule, it's full too.  It's also awkward to transfer stuff without an account bank so I'd rather just play less.
---
Yes, I was doing the sheepsquash one last night and got stuck in respawn... so did several other players in the area. The server was struggling super hard to keep up with what was going on in that area. I waited around for the thing to be killed and the caps being added animation to play before closing my game and giving up for the night.
---
iv somehow only managed to crash twice and iv been playing since closed beta
---
Completely agree, it drives me insane as well
---
I think this will not work, as all the containers in the game (including tents) will be on per person basis. Which means you and another person will see different contents in the same container.
---
Why can't we just pick ALL the ammo we want to get rid of like within a container menu. The put it in the machine where it just figures out how much ammo points to give us automatically and leaves the rest of the ammo. Then, we just pick an ammo type and with one menu, you can just choose the max amount of ammo possible to craft based on the points you have. Why is it so convoluted?
---
...and yet this sub still vilified them and blames all their personal problems on DuPeRs
---
1200 hours since launch... I‚Äôve had only a few really decent drops. BE Handmade, QE Harpoon, Van AP/WWR Scout armor, V/10/15r fixer... and a few other decent ones. RNG is just too minuscule a chance to get something really good. I say dupe away.
---
He's bugged out for me so i can't even go there for that now :(
---
You‚Äôre sad lol. Pathetic.
---
No cross play or cross progression (what you're asking about), unfortunately.
---
I just made a post without seeing this oops, but yes me. I've tried everything every thread or forum post I've come across. And nothing has worked.
---
At this point i just go "yeah, thats about right" and just play anything else.
---
Fo76 is fun, but its not fun enough to boot up again after a crash.
---
What is so wrong with wanting the chance to get a random reroll on a daily or weekly? It‚Äôs super common in games that have such quests/missions to have a limited reroll so why are you so defensive about it?
---
Haha that's exactly it. This sub can definitely be a cesspool of complaining and I hope I'm not adding to it too much with this post, it's meant to be constructive albeit frustrated criticism.
---
You hit the nail on the head as to why everyone in-game is so nice though. We're already fighting the game, we don't wanna fight each other. Plus, a lot of us Fallout fans just really love the universe and know what it could be and just want it to succeed, for all of our sakes.
---
I agree but there are a lot of other players getting farther ahead off the work of others. I got to where I was in the game by myself with the grinding and hard work I did, and never got any help from anyone. Idk man.
---
There should be no perk coins, just reaching level 300 should be enough.
---
I use building teams if I‚Äôm just screwing around.
---
Happened twice during encrypted but I didn‚Äôt wanna lose the loot so I waited ten minutes and then you can respawn but it fucking sucks
---
Yeah what he said.
---
man first time Im around for one of these and its the worst one yet
---
So allowing dupers to turn their ill-gotten gains directly into XP or Atoms? Yeah... That's never going to happen. Not until/unless Bethesda finally manages to fix their absolute dumpster fire of an item transaction system that is constantly allowing duping.
---
It happens if the event ends while you die
---
I honestly didn't think it was all that bad but I love the improvement
---
Oh. Oh no. So higher ranks require MORE coins?!
---
I know I just feel bad sometimes about stuff like that.  I always try to wait until the person who spawned the event (when I catch their name) arrives before I start killing legendary mobs etc. Now, having said that, I am gearing up and cleaning up my perk cards so I can not solo the Queen, but still.
---
Not true. I‚Äôve tested it. People have taken part or all. And the stuff remains after I log out.
---
You'll all be able to loot corpses of the same enemies and their loot will be instanced similar to containers, and if your teammates are in the same general area they can get instanced loot from things you kill even if they didn't get a hit in. Also if a team member completes quests or events, everyone in the team will get a few caps no matter how far away they are. But aside from that, to everything else you said- correct, unfortunately.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you answer the question?
---
Yeah on game pass. I put in a support ticket with Bethesda, so hopefully they will respond and try and help.
---
It released November 14, 2018...
---
I'm a PC player, and I avoid external drives like they have the plague. A USB cable is just not as fast as the SATA cable used for an internal drive. That said, this is a ridiculously large game, so I can see how that could be a problem...
---
I can't trigger the quest. All he says is, "Hush. Not right now." He doesn't give the quest anymore. I deleted his chair just after the Update-- right after finishing and turning in his quest. It said "Ally Quest Whatever the Title Is Failed" and hasn't worked since.
---
There will always be people in life like that. Don't let them bother you. You know you put in the work and time and that's all that should matter.
---
Interesting, good to know, it seems tents work differently then other containers. Thanks for the info!
---
There is nothing to spend caps on, I'm usually trying to not hit the cap limit.  Even if I find something, it weighs something which defeats the entire purpose. Once you've bought all the plans caps are nearly worthless.
---
No problem I hope you get your rewards before they turn them back off!
---
Exactly this. As long as the x4 is there what on earth does it matter. Everyone is leeching on this for their own gains and everyone benfits. 
---
If you wanna team up to do stuff together, do it with friends in a team, but of course random people are gonna join and do their own thing. You can't all farm west tek together reasonably etc. 
---
Baffles me so much I've started just creating my own team and not joining others because I'm sick of being x4 bonded in a building team for like an hour to get randomly kicked for no reason so they can then drop the bond and have people join/leave all over?
---
I did it about an hour ago and there were maybe 5 other people. No problems getting the ingredients and the Event went fine.
---
we don't have a choice on whether we play it online or offline. like I said, a lot of us play Fo76 in spite of it being online, not because of it.
---
Bethesda, in their infinite wisdom, denied us local servers.
---
This. This gets my upvote. It‚Äôs a goddamn lottery most of the time, and I so badly want that frickin bear arm plan from PP. I even took to exploiting the moist radkelp when no one joins, which is just a write-off when solo, so that when PP starts and others join, I can dump 60 radkelp and get a head start on things...
---
Still no bear arm plan, even with my hoarded radkelp :(
---
Dang...Thank you for instant updates on that. Guess I am stuck cursing my PS4...
---
For all I know it is my system/HD that sucks. I didn't start out playing this game with the absolute garbage performance I have been running into these past couple months. Something has happened recently that has turned it into a hot mess. I also had to re-install the entire game file about a month ago due to a corrupt game file, I may just have an external HD that is crapping the bed on me at this point.
---
I prefer the building team for the int boost. Mainly on the public team to get the xp boost from inspirational while leveling another alt.
---
they are talking about the Jukebox, not the radios. There is currently only 1 option for the jukebox.
---
I'd rather they just have an option for a hard mode version of adventure mode, and I am worried about the implementation of "One Wasteland" if they do it poorly. 
---
They need to do SOMETHING though - 80% of the map is out-leveled and totally pointless content. Players are going to spend 10% or less of their total playtime in the sub level 50 level range, so it seems smart to be able to make the whole map relevant for level 50+ players.
---
I got banned from Xbox live cuz I picked one up
---
Waiting for a reply on my ticket
---
Yea I instantly killed the queen a few time I feel bad for it if you have a bloodied lmg with limb dmg and fire rate with ultracite it takes like 6 clips to kill her
---
Really not sure what's causing it ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I think most containers work this way. I‚Äôve done it with many other containers and other people have found the stuff.
---
The stuff that the game generates for players is always different.
---
And these tents sometimes have things in them already. So they are t really different than other containers.
---
Dude, I'm also really disappointed about Bethesda's lack of response to the SCORE bugs, but people are *all over* this sub talking about the auto-complete issues. It's definitely not something "few people care about or support". 
---
I do have to wonder if part of the problem is that they just have no fucking idea what causes the bug up there in the cobbled-together MMO system they've made and aren't sure how to address it, because if what other people are saying is correct, it seems to be related to an already-existing bug with the old challenges that's been around for a *long* time.
---
Aye. im sitting on 30k right now on my main. hiding on private while i try to buy flux and/or 2mm ec
---
This system is insane, they are taking stuff that is needed to fix what is wrong with the game and requiring gaining an insane amount of levels to fix issues that should not even exist.
---
PA- there is no advantage to wearing power armor over regular armor with all of the benefits of wearing regular armor instead. The only reason for wearing PA is role playing and due to the lack of benefits and REDUCED carry capacity  and DR for wearing it role-players are put at a huge disadvantage. These 2 useless perks they are adding does not address any of the issues of this. Worse some of these perks give even further advantages to NOT wearing power armor.
---
The most expensive things in the Atom shop are centered around Power armor, you would think they would want people to have a reason to wear power armor instead of putting those people at a disadvantage to get people to spend money to buy atoms to get flashy things for their power armor.
---
Next is the QOL stuff
---
Yes Fallout is fundamentally a survival game
---
Yes you should need to eat and drink during game play,  but you should not have to every five freaking minutes. How many times a day do you eat? I only eat twice a day now since I work from home and the gyms are closed again. Before our little wuhanflu epidemic I ate about 4 times a day and maybe had a snack during the day, I certainly didn't eat every hour of the day.
---
The game requiring us to use perks to not have to eat every hour and drink every five minutes even with using mutations is just silly. it is taking us out of RP and into fantasy PVE mechanics.
---
These cards should be an incentive for those that have been playing and not feel like a burden to get to correct things that are wrong with the game.
---
I usually avoid online games, but I hear duping is generally a problem...? I just don't like sharing my game map with so many other people.
---
I forgot about No Man's Sky! I haven't played in SUCH a long time. Is it still all crashy? I actually liked it before. Now it's so different!
---
Go.to Sutton and visit the house in front of the overseers house, I found tech data in the container behind one of the doors there multiple times. I didn't go there today, but I just found two separate pieces in different places and turned them in two separate times.
---
He probably crashed, or died and couldn't respawn and didnt make it back to the server. In any case, I think you're in the clear.
---
Fuck the bullshit duped ebay economy.
---
Scorched Earth is a public event, everyone is welcome to join it on a public server.
---
The public teams can help, as most don't use microphones. Learn the emotes as they are a major form of communication because most don't talk. Everything can be done alone, stick the forest for a while. If a high level is following you odds are he wants to drop a bunch of stuff for you. They can't PVP unless you want to. Watch out for trap camps, just store your junk. Most people want to help more than anything. Good luck.
---
When we reach 76 different currencies.
---
I kinda feel like the gold bullion system hit a good pace for me personally, in that, yes, it would take a long time to get everything, but literally about half of the items for sale were plans for mods and stuff that I just didn't care for for the build I was going for, and to get a particular thing I wanted really didn't take all that long. I don't need any of the night vision plans, but getting the dirt farm tiles from the settlers was about 3 or 4 days of play.
---
It's been discovered that, when people would eat food set out for them, when there was the option of a bowl of chips versus an actual meal item, a lot of people who opted for the snacks ended up eating more in the end than those who went for something more substantial and then decided to quit after just one or two. Same concept could apply here: give us a lot of things we can easily "nibble" on instead of a couple giant things that'll take several months before we see anything come of it.
---
...maybe that seems random, but I hope you get the point I'm trying to make.
---
Fuck I was gonna do the same. Let‚Äôs hope they fix this
---
You're all good man no one can kill you or steal your stuff, most people will do is wave at you and maybe drop you some items, have fun!
---
Same! Gotta rush!!
---
Presidential seals will arrive (sooner or later).
---
&gt; The perks are hit or miss and requires a perk point to now remove a perk, WHICH WAS NOT A THING WHEN THEY FIRST INTRODUCED THE LEGENDARY PERKS IN THE PTS!
---
Believe me, it was *way* worse when introduced to the PTS. Once you picked your perks there was no way to change them at all until you unlocked a new slot. Furthermore, you had to fill all your slots - you couldn't leave any empty. So anyone above level 300 when the system launched would have been absolutely fucked - they would have had one shot to pick their six perks, and that would have been it forever.
---
Yep. If the gauss rifle came with a scope on it they would be pretty good but it usually just drop them as soon as I can find a 10mm smg or better.
---
I'm guessing you have some weight perks or Unyelding armor. It doesn't always register on death and if you spawn over encumbered you can spawn at your camp or 76.
---
Players always think they know better than developers. Sometimes they're right, but they often overestimate their own understanding of design.
---
The people repeatedly criticizing level scaling don't look at other games where it's been successfully implemented, because it undermines their arguments.
---
24/7 with events like scorched earth and then i think about all the ammo and arsenal durability that was unfortunately wasted
---
I meant the event
---
All I know is that it isn't on my end at all. My internet connection is great, and other games don't have the issue. I also have some games on my PC that run perfectly smoothly.
---
I figure it'll get fixed up eventually.
---
They never show the Gauntlet love. It's my favourite weapon in the game. I took down 2 lvl 80 scorchbeasts with around 10 hits each, I was lvl 72. Was dishing out just under 600dmg per hit. It's just a 2* Legendary Bloodied with an extra blade. Lvl 50ish Assaultrons take about 4 hits, unless they kill me first ü§£ But overall, the weapon is incredible. It needs love.
---
and so it begins
---
I get a handful of caps... If they never completed a quest I wouldn't even notice
---
Don't pick up duped stuff if you aren't willing to risk it.
---
been selling them for 4-5k consistently in my vendor
---
here are the other prices
---
White dirty/Withered - worthless
---
White Clean - up to 500 caps
---
Brown - up to 1k
---
Blue - up to 4k
---
Green - up to 5k
---
Pink - up to 12k
---
Yellow - up to 15k
---
Forest - up to 25k
---
Red - caps cannot buy. Like 150k+
---
You'll be fine, I'm about 3,000 hours in and it's all solo time, have teamed with randoms at events before, but solo is my preferred playing. If other players come up to you, sometimes with a mic, I usually give them a thumbs up and continue with my playing. As long as you turn on passive mode after level 5, other players can not hurt you (minus some events and workshops).
---
I don‚Äôt think they are banning for that, it could literally be done by accident to people in some cases.
---
I'm on PC. I'm not all that great in grouping and my main is only 64. Stealth Sniper. PM me.
---
As anyone who has ever done any modding that involves changing the UI in any way will tell you, it's very difficult to do new UI stuff in Fallout 4 (and presumably that rolled over to Fallout 76). Their approach is hacky but doesn't surprise me - the handful of UI folks they do have are probably buys with Starfield at the moment.
---
It's not very rare. At least on PC, you can find it in player vendors between 500 and 2k caps. Green and brown are the less rare asylum outfits
---
One of the most common criticisms about Fallout 76 is the early game feels very limiting. There aren't enough quests to level you up, so you're confined to lower-level zones farming events and mobs to level up. I saw almost every review of Wastelanders mention this.
---
Other games that have implemented level scaling have proven that it doesn't have to remove scaling challenge. A 50+ enemy in the Mire can still be much tougher than a 45 Scorched in the Forest.
---
Project paradise, encryptid.  Because they fun to play.
---
Yeah there is a fix, called VATS üòÅ
---
Oil lamps and the fire pit have a fire orange glow. Don't see why the barrel shouldn't.
---
Suckered into a traceable dupe hey :-)
---
Timer and lag bad
---
Preston is a good guy. He means well; he's just a bit dim. He's less obnoxious that some other NPCs that BGS likes to throw at us. "Let me guess; someone stole your sweetroll."
---
Ah, ok. I've not used the jukebox.
---
When I logged in last all my dailies except the NW daily showed as completed, so I lost out on 1750 score. Submitted a ticket. First time it has happened to me during the LR. Since I can play everyday, I'm not worried about it preventing me from getting to 100, but it was annoying.
---
Mistress of Mystery is also unused now, I went there yesterday hoping a new NPC decided to take up the mantle but nothing.
---
I've been trying to to the daily raider quest of finding the hunters for weeks now. I usually spend my time west of the Savage Divide so most times I cant go past there due to fast travel costs. Then one day they spawned right across Charleston, my camp is in front of the train station there. I rush over and talk to the deserter or whatever, the game lags. Okay it might take a moment to load the conversation. Then it stays frozen. I exit the game for a moment, that could help. Still frozen. I close the game and dont play for 3 days after that.
---
I got a bats paint about an hour ago. The challenges also count towards the Weekly NW SCORE challenge.
---
Awesome!! Thank you for the update!
---
So true! So many currencies that I stopped caring about anything but caps for my FT!
---
I think there should be jukebox carts that allow you to select the music the jukebox plays.  You can even scatter them around the map like the pip-boy game tapes.  To install the tapes you can have an install option to pull up the jukebox's inventory.  When you press play a menu will pop up to let you select which cart to play.
---
I would be cool. I‚Äôd rather see us get a 1-2 point boost to INT or CHR. Music makes your smarter sort of thing.
---
Hugged by a mierlurk king my new favorite saying.
---
It just works...
---
I‚Äôd be good with more choices for legendary turn-ins. When devs conjure a RNG formula this randomly cruel and scrip limits set so deliberately low it would make Mr. Burns tent his fingers and purr ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù, it does make me wonder why I chase after things with a star in the name.
---
I am not a fan of NW, but not gonna to bash or for those that are.
---
My concern is I'm joining just to do the daily SCORE challenge, am I screwing over my team by not playing the PVP? Is there a way to enter NW solo?
---
As you can see in my post, many ppl have this problem. Guess Bethesda fkd it up again...
---
Is my character banned
---
Ok thanks. I also have a blue asylum dress but would it be worth around 2k-3k
---
I‚Äôm going for the repeatable to make up what I lost. I know I can since it wasn‚Äôt a huge amount. It‚Äôs more frustrating that this is the replacement to the prior atom awards. And like always it‚Äôs bugged and seems untested.
---
Uh no it's not. Green is one of the more common ones. 
---
White dirty/Withered, White Clean, Brown, Blue/Green, Pink/Yellow/ Forest, Red.
---
That's the general order. Blue and green interchangeably, and pink yellow and forest interchangeably.
---
PTS, is that still available thru the bethesda launcher if I switched to Steam?
---
It's hard to believe that NPCs would loop annoying dialog in a Bethesda game.
---
When it crashes i just go ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bethesda for ya i guess.‚Äù
---
Dang. I think I walked up to the door with camera in hand and the quest started up when I got to the porch area. Did you go to the door? Definitely with a working camera and camera film on your toon?
---
Well your main point of "its only 250 points" is void because of the fact you need every single challenge completed to reach lvl 100, so its not just something you can choose to not do.
---
PA will giver you better overall percentage reduction with the right perks. I'd use T51 over Ultracite since it is cheaper to repair. I ran a full bolstering set on my character for a while and there wasn't much of a noticeable difference versus unyielding. I usually run PA at the SBQ and poison is usually my only concern.
---
Not 5 minutes ago, I'm playing with newbie on a public team. I ask about his power armor. And it's his only one so I set out for a frame to build a new one. After searching 8 know locations I finally find one only to get a blue screen as I hit enter. :(
---
Thank you! I played games with my older brother as a kid so am used to not being helped at all, but really, that‚Äôs comforting to know! I like the idea of emotes, as I don‚Äôt own a mic!!
---
I have no F'ing idea why we need some kind of exploit to do this. Why this isn't possible by default?
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm going to do my best to have fun with it! Maybe I‚Äôll get brave enough to wave back!
---
&gt; More options, not more steps to get to a few options.
---
Oh my god, this! I wish I could upvote you more than once!
---
Just wanted to pop in here and let you know we are reading all of this feedback and relaying this back to the team. Thank you for taking the time to write this all out.
---
Makes me wonder if Perk Coins won't be available in the Atom store in the future.
---
I‚Äôm not a huge online multiplayer person myself so was really anxious about playing this, BUT the community is actually pretty decent. I know people do deal with griefers but it‚Äôs easy to block/report and switch servers to avoid them.
---
I‚Äôve done every mission solo and even launched a nuke solo, so it can be played alone but it‚Äôs just a bit harder to do (which is never a bad thing) so if you wanna play the main game on your own go nuts.
---
Events you‚Äôll get anyone who wants to join in, join in. But you‚Äôre all an event team so no one can kill you (except the enemies) but you‚Äôre all working together for a singular goal.
---
The team system is great for bonuses and each team type does a different thing, once in a team your teammates can‚Äôt steal from your camp and people mostly go about their game enjoying the bonuses and not really interacting, or so I‚Äôve found anyway.
---
Sorry this is so long I hope it helps and makes sense! I got the game at beta and stopped playing until lockdown but I‚Äôm really into it and the new Legendary SCORE challenges.

You missed the stage of the meme where one person has a legit good idea and gets chucked out.
---
Thank you!! I didn‚Äôt know there was a passive mode! Oh that‚Äôs so helpful, thank you!! I‚Äôm really glad to hear that they can‚Äôt hurt you, and they‚Äôre okay with you walking away. Emotes might just save my ass on this one
---
post on here when you want to do one. Usually people know what they're doing. Also. Do the pylons yourself.
---
Thank you that helped out quite a bit. Done.
---
Ty is there a timer that i have to wait to launch one?
---
My whole camp inside and out is lit only with oil lamps.  Every other light seems to have the warmth of a hospital surgical room.
---
Ty. How often can i launch nukes.
---
Found 2 by luck in my first game, did 3 more and none. Fuck this daily.
---
People are generally friendly in this game, it's pretty common for players to just give you free stuff if you're a newbie. Some people might pick fights, but fights won't start unless you shoot back. If you're not a fan of that, then there is a Pacifist mode you can flip on in the settings to make it so you never initiate/reciprocate combat.
---
They are somewhat expensive, so I highly doubt it. That's kind of the problem. You'll have to burn/earn so many levels, it's notreally feasible.
---
Also having this issue, tried all the fixes I can.
---
Awesome! Thanks again for your time too!
---
gotcha gotcha, that's mighty unfortunate. thanks for the speedy answer ^^
---
yes, many times my friend.
---
I think that's the point they don't want anyone getting overpowered easily.
---
lol
---
also someone already hit 100 on score. And they did it in 4 days. Not condoning what they did because they basically had like 12 hours sleep and that's not healthy but yeah... so. LOL
---
have you heard yourself, man.
---
I know yeah. It‚Äôs daft. I want them to bring in spiral stairs that only take up one foundation
---
Harder to detect while sneaking.
---
The battle royale is so broken they should jusy remove frog legs I get regular solo wins when I abuse it
---
I dont care about canon or not, i just want my damn laser musket from fo4! Since we are talking about minutemans
---
What system are you on, if it's PS4 I would be happy to give you beginner gear.
---
There's times I'll die \~7-9 times. I grab the pylons, as many as needed because no one else wants to touch them. Sometimes I lose track of my health forget to stim myself and die other times I get obliterated by the SS. Once I get my couple of hits in, I go and hide holding all the pylons, letting everyone else finish the SS off.
---
Unyielding armor with a mix of chameleon. I am a stealth commando and with unyielding I can run through Westek and kill all the super mutants without being seen.
---
Here are the ways I save save caps fast traveling
---
1) Set my tent at either Foundation or the Crater
---
2) Use the travel agent perc
---
3) Join a public team
---
4) Jump into public events
---
5) Fast travel to the 76 vault (its free)
---
No you didn't.
---
Lmao exactly this my man. I built a camp just outside nuka factory by that boat (before the story mission there though btw i was stoked when it was just opposite my camp lol) and man somehow i placed shit underwater haha.
---
They made "new" UI for gold bullion vendors and before that scrip by recycling the UI used for vendors. It's more difficult, but they have done it twice before, and there were so many people suggesting it you'd think they'd take it to heart and have plenty of time to do it by update 21. What I suspect is they are worried about creating more opportunities for a duping exploit, as they've already had to patch exploits for vendors, scrip machines, and displays.
---
What platform and can you tank any pylons?
---
The last daily like this was 3 creatures, no idea why this one is 9. Guessing whoever makes the challenges doesn't actually play the game though and probably just thought "oh, creatures, they are easy to kill!"
---
Thank you, it explains really what I needed to hear! I enjoy hard games, if it‚Äôs not a challenge then I get a little bored. I‚Äôm kind of excited/nervous to see what the community is like, and you‚Äôve definitely helped put my mind at ease ah . I‚Äôm really really happy to hear that you can do most of it solo, and it sounds like the teamwork is an option. I think I‚Äôll build up to that! Thank you thank you!!üíõ
---
I hope the don‚Äôt have a limit
---
Is that the only way???!!! You dont get like 100 for every 50 levels or something??
---
Oh gosh that‚Äôs so lovely! I‚Äôm on Xbox unfortunately, but the offer has made my night. Thank you üíõüíõ
---
I said this under another topic, but the gold bullion hit a good note for me: a lot of options, some I'll want and others I won't. Collecting everything will take a while, but if I want to zero in on something, maybe a week tops.
---
I'm at 24.    
---
I don't plan on going insane to get 100. I'm not a PA user and am still trying to learn it.    
---
I really like the Guille suit options as my main is a Cloaked Stealth sniper with a Combat Rifle and a3 start Black Powder Rifle for backups.    
---
I haven't used the Lunchboxes b/c I think they do best in groups that stick together for awhile, am I right?    
---
Extra perk card packs are always a plus. Extra caps and Atoms? Great. I haven't finished Wastelanders so I haven't an idea on how Bullion works or how to effectively use it.
---
It feels like we should get a perk coin per level, plus be able to scrap cards with each upgrade set at around 50 perk coins.
---
Still makes it reasonably tough to level the cards - without scrapping cards, you‚Äôd get one legendary perk or upgrade every fifty levels, with scrapping you‚Äôre probably looking at 25/30 at higher levels.
---
Still means you need substantial amounts of levels to get a full set of legendary perks, but doesn‚Äôt make them unobtainable for average users.
---
Either that or make the legendary perks WAY better to justify the grind.
---
I always wished that when all instruments are played the tune would change and unlock a secret song. But, alas my Easter egg will never be. Stairway to heaven? Or Mort in the Wayward jumps in and sings a song with the band on stage. Easter egg musical.
---
It‚Äôs fucking Destiny 2 FOMO all over again. Keep logging in every day for crumbs if you want to play legit. Seasons were a terrible idea and don‚Äôt belong in the fallout setting.
---
but ZoMg!! what about collectors..?
---
 of a thing that nobody in no way could ever see???
---
Well yeah the grind to get there is expensive. Doesn't mean they're not going to be meta. Chances are there are going to be websites or guides that list "recommended" legendary perks to grind for first and this will be at the top for sure. If not the best. They seem to be the best I've seen so far.
---
5 pieces unyielding, Chinese stealth for nuke zones and water, 5 pieces Trouble shooters for silo runs and Encryptid.
---
Handmade medium scope, trouble shooters handmade reflex sight.
---
Yep same here, tried the solutions but nothing worked
---
Thanks for letting me know! I lost my veil so can't get back in. I mean it's around somewhere on a mule but couldn't be assed to go find it
---
The framerate and lag issues are what irratate me the most. Crash during sbq fight a lot. Framerare gets choppy consistently. Ive spent a lot of time trying to become op but when i do a bunch of damage especially with my bloodied combat shotty it rubber bands their health back up when the bar goes empty. Big lame.
---
I am at 293, I should be over 300 by the time legendary perks come out. And I don‚Äôt think I even need them for anything but bragging rights and karma whoring.
---
Passive mode seem like my kind of game! Thank you!! I do love the fighting, but not when it‚Äôs another real life person. Hopefully I don‚Äôt sound like a toddler, I‚Äôm an adult, I swear. Just makes me nervous. So I‚Äôm super glad there‚Äôs a passive mode!! Thank you thank you!üíõ
---
in 100+ hours of looking for the red i still haven't found a yellow or forest.
---
Its sad cause the gauss shotgun is way better then the rifle atm, it would be neat if they added mods in nw so you could tweak the weapons, make something shit decent.
---
Dogs, scorpions and ghouls all spawn fairly often around the larger building areas. Morgantown Airport usually has a few around it. I always see them around the edges of the last few circles.
---
No limit on carrying them, but they weigh .25 each and aren't affected by any weight reduction perks
---
There's a bigger problem with the system involving perk card packs.
---
If you open a pack that has cards you've already maxxed, the duplicates are discarded.  So high level players have had many cards deleted even without respeccing.
---
It's clear this new system needs modifications, hopefully they are working on it.
---
People are intentionally lagging the servers to dupe stuff. The video I watched said all they really need is 2 nuke zones to lag it sufficiently.
---
Xbox Live has nothing to do with getting banned. OP probably let their Xbox Gold expire.
---
Hey now, I still wonder about all the heroic feats that the one guard would have done if he had not taken an arrow to the knee. I bet he could have united all of Tamriel and saved everyone from the forces of evil. I guess it was just not meant to be...
---
SS Armor with a Chameleon bonus
---
Hey, can a ps4 be operated with an SSD? That might get rid of some of the problems for you.
---
Hmm. Didn‚Äôt know that. Are they under misc?
---
papa!
---
I used to melt scorchbeasts with my BE Tesla before 20, now I barely do any damage. But just with SB's and SBQ. Everything else it still melts.
---
I skip those bitches, just team up events team, reach 3 x boost and level up twice or so with a lap of West Tek then White spring  instead, plus legendaries as a bonus :-)
---
When you're on here I'd suggest using the flair and making sure what you play on so others who are on the same can help. I'm on PC and a solo player myself.    
---
There is no 'catch up'. There is a LOT of lore in playing alone, listening to people/robots, reading notes and listening to holotapes just like the other Fallout games.    
---
If you don't have good gear and your perks/build is all over the place then that char will be screwed as far as survivability. My first char was so jacked up I had to delete it.    
---
Use the Nukes and Dragons site as well as searching for solo builds.    
---
If you have any other questions feel free to PM me so we don't clog this up.
---
Make sure that after you hit level 5, you turn pacifist on in the settings if you do not want to PVP. This will keep you from accidentally engaging in PVP with folks. (You are auto pacifist before level 5)
---
Returning photos to Davenport like normal with 8+ int gives option to convince him to give you more caps as incentive to take more photos for him in the future.
---
i edited my comment. blue is slightly less common than green (i find like 2-3 green for every blue) but in my opinion it sells better. 4k is doable.
---
If on Xbox, post on the LFG (looking for group). You'll have no shortage of help.
---
same here dude
---
I will make sure to remember that! That‚Äôd be my worst nightmare!!! I‚Äôm so happy they have given the option for thatüíõ
---
same problem and troubleshooting did not help
---
Squad manouvers does not stack with speed demon mutation, so I do not recommend sharing this one  If you don't have this mutation, get it now. Everyone should have speed demon.
---
I get around 24 superstims a day legitimately. If I don‚Äôt clean my inventory for a week, I‚Äôd have 200 and just dump it where someone could use it. A diluted stim tops me off, so I never use super stims
---
Rare weapons was the economy. Now they're all duped
---
mixed types and effects.. I only use CSA in nuke zones
---
currently.. 1 auto stim, 1 chameleon, one trouble shooters and one mutant slayer on my limbs..
---
my chest is the named one you get from a quest that has harder to detect on it..
---
I agree.
---
Sniper: was an army chaplain pre war. Worked on a small scale matter manipulator. That got him into Vault 76.  
---
Big Iron: A US Marshall. After a number of bloody shootouts he was put on a number of chems to save his life. Made a shock collar that zaps the wearer when they lie. 
---
Heavy: big comic nerd. Read a lot of grognak and wanted be a wizard. Invented a flaming throwing hand cannon for PA. Not sure why she was selected to vault 76
---
Archer: Her dad invented an arrow tip that locks on to flesh like a magnet. Government stole his research. In order to get revenge he taught is little girl to use the bow and be a woodsmen. Once the vault opened and spending too many nights in the wastes she kinda got a little feral and gained a taste for flesh. 
---
Monk: just a gas station clerk. He was also training to be a boxer. After losing a fight he worked on a glove that could steal the victims life force. Was caught with the prototype. Was spent to vault 76 as blackmail.
---
Im gonna say proof or it didn't happen
---
That's the economy...
---
THIS\^ 
---
That sounds like the most logical explanation for the grind they're setting up.
---
Lament over our misfortune together.
---
Well we already know were getting a new one for the BOS. And honestly adding new currencies is basicaly SOP for persistent world ‚Äúmmos‚Äú because they don‚Äôt want you to just run over to the new faction shop,  drop a pile of the old currency you have been building up on the new vendors and then log out because you already bought everything up front. New currency at least forces you to actually work for it When the dpansion drops.
---
Exactly what they want ;) theres a way around this if you do a quick google and top of that the supplies needed are going to be really cheap.
---
#bethesdafixyourfkengame
---
Just try not to worry about grinding for anything and play the game in a more relaxed manner, never buy Atoms with real money and only login if you feel like it, real life should take precedent on everything gaming.
---
Regardless of build, you can and should farm pump action shotguns and Hunting rifles. You'll eventually get the plan for the latter one but a good modded Sniper Rifle with Supressor can net you taking out enemies without them finding you if you play right.    
---
Things get up close? Shotgun to THE FACE.    
---
At level 30 Starched Genes can be obtained and I would take it and it's next rank immediately. Mutations don't stick unless you have that card equipped and maxed out. Most enemies weak spot is their head. If you're good at aiming, taking out a leg or whatever it has will slow it considerably.    
---
If you post your build by using Nukes and Dragons I'm sure others could help you a lot more.
---
300 hours in and only 3 crashes. I'm one of the lucky ones
---
Don't tempt me Gavin! ... Understand Gavin, I collect fusion cores from a desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
---
Always good to see you, friend.
---
New player coming in is going to have a hell of a time with the learning curve.
---
Well, I use a vampiric ffr flamer, so I can take all 3 pylons, and others help finish the imposter bot.
---
But I am not want to spend caps on cards, so I only help out others if the event pops up on the server where I log
---
You still want to do it now? I'll run nukes with you GT is Damudkipbros
---
Check the server first, if a bunch are over 100 they will usually tip up if they notice it, I do.
---
I also lean toward recommending PA. If nothing else, it affords good DR while you tinker with your build and chase after your ideal non-PA armor. I got a lot of mileage out of X-01, but ultracite is pretty good too. I‚Äôve finally gotten to T-65, and I feel like I can take my time going after my ideal SS armor. If I do at all.
---
nope sorry
---
Do it after scorched earth on a server, announce what you are doing, good chance many will join.
---
Also did this challenge today was the First time i played NW and i need to say its awesome def will play it more often now
---
Spent all day gathering items to build the Excavator PA and then once I registered it, I immediately fast traveled to my Camp and then got out.....and then there was nothing anywhere.  
---
I didn‚Äôt have a PA power station frame built yet, could that be a reason?
---
Is this a bug for all types of PA or just excavator?  
---
Really bummed....felt good accomplishing my first set (I‚Äôm level 28).
---
I mean if yall are so sad about it you could glitch into godmode
---
toss up really.. could be everyone.. could be nobody..
---
Me..? Ive been disappointed so often by players who do not know how to do it or refuse to help.. I dont even go to them anymore unless Ive already done a couple events on server and the population has proven they arent turds..
---
No blue screen on xbox. Just screen freeze and loud AF stuttering.
---
I don't understand their aversion to rewarding high level players.
---
I've played this game long enough to get to level 300, surely I should be pretty damn strong. Surely I should be rewarded for sticking around.
---
Not everything has to be a difficult nay IMPOSSIBLE grind.
---
The legendary perk system should be as simple as, a new slot is unlocked every 50 levels and you can pay in caps to unlock the higher ranks. Just reward the people that play your damn game for fucks sake.
---
And none of this talk about, if it's too easy the higher level characters will be too OP. Good! They should be!
---
It's more of an aesthetic choice for me to not want PA, I hate stomping around like optimus prime all the time and like seeing character and my outfits
---
2 matches - 5 in one, 4 in another
---
&gt;Ammo crafting in New Vegas was even more unnecessarily complicated than this, though, making you collect different powders, primers, and cases for each ammo type.
---
That's really no different than collecting different types of junk, ores and gunpowder.
---
Besides, I don't think anyone's suggesting that they implement primers and cases.  Just a system where you can break bullets down to their components and use those components to craft more desirable ammo.
---
A lot more popular lately with the public teams and the challenges daily. 
---
However it's a double edged sword. It fails more than any other event by far, either through wiful ignorance or, more commonly now, Xp farming the bots and ignoring the objective. 
---
Still worth doing though. I've been sinking all my spare caps into buying keycards so I have a stock, but just be aware it fails a lot and can be frustrating and costly in regards to caps and meds.
---
You have a long timer before you have to activate it, so my advice would be to start the countdown, then sit on the terminal yourself and let the timer count down a bit to allow more people to join- this blocks some git joining your event and instantly recalling the robot themselves and fucking everything up with not enough people. 
---
Fine line between waiting and people getting bored, but most wil lstick around as the drops can be good. Good luck!
---
Ss armor?
---
Very welcome. And it is definitely unfortunate, considering going anywhere as a team means whoever isn't hitting as many enemies just misses out on exp. You're better off going solo if you need exp and can handle yourself, not much sense in staying together as a team unless it's to provide backup when someone can't kill things.
---
 Someone on here once told me their personal motto for 76 is "playing alone, together." I think this is incredibly on point.
---
Are you able to comment if something is sticking out as interesting?
---
Honest question what do you do after level 100 ?
---
Plus I have full bolstering bos heavy combat, and that combined with serendipity makes me very tanky, but I was just wondering if PA could be massively better or if the difference was negligible
---
I just bought it last week. So far I can say that I like it.  The scrapbox alone is a relieve. It cut my stash from 780 to 400. Infinite building materials are worth it to be because I enjoy camp building. same with the free atom points each month
---
The tent is nice to have as well.  I play with a friend that doesn't have FO1st and he's a packrat.  I drop the tent for him to unload and we go on our merry way.
---
By no means do you need it, but overall I say it's nice to have. I'm happy I did it at almost 2 weeks in.
---
I've tried seeing the positives in some of the stuff they do, but if they do that, I'll for the first time, contemplate uninstall.
---
I dont think alot of people understand intelligence gives more experience. It's hard to get a full building team but i think it's the best way to grind XP.
---
Me too so I was pretty glad a lot of the game is quite hard.
---
The community is pretty friendly, I usually google any questions I have but I‚Äôm always directed to reddit where someone‚Äôs answered it for someone else.
---
Teams are handy for xp boosts and you can fast travel to teammates camps for free so they are a benefit but there‚Äôs no need to be in a team if you don‚Äôt want to.
---
You‚Äôre very welcome! Glad to be of help :)
---
Teams are great.  Who cares what the others are doing, you're getting a bonus either way.  My friends list has really grown since the start of this.
---
&gt; Do it after scorched earth on a server
---
This.
---
SBQ fights happen fairly frequently, so next time one of those happens, observe the players and levels who show up. After they're done with the SBQ, give it a minute and start Encryptid. You'll find many of those same players will show up there as well.
---
Secret Services Armor
---
Chinese Stealth armor is fine, but I prefer wear many pieces with legendary bonuses
---
A bunch of old bullshit.  The only legendary piece I have is a weightless heavy metal chest piece, which is glitched or something cuz no way 4.5 lbs is 90% lighter.
---
I have found other stuff but it's mostly junkies and I use chems sparingly and have never even had to use an addictol.  Or else it's some weak-ass wood armor with little protective value.  I usually don't even repair armor anymore, I just keep a few extra bits in Stash and use something new rather than trying to find ballistic material to repair.
---
I am rocking a lot of heavy pieces right now...not sure if that hurts your sneak ability but I seem to sneak adequately.
---
I know. Just couldn‚Äôt help myself

---
Hey man cut me some slack, my essays aren‚Äôt that bad
---
I mean, people are forgetting legendary cards are account bound, but it's still ridiculous.
---
Yes even went inside he just had some generic line. I just writ it off for today but thx again for trying to help
---
I thought about that. The last time I played there were like 4 scorched earth and I got so much legendary scrip from all of my loot.
---
Awesome story.  I love last second victories.  I‚Äôve gotten to where I‚Äôll message low levels in silos.  Many times they‚Äôre shitting bricks and want help.
---
Welcome to locker room
---
It's still better than PvP in Adventure mode ever was even if it is a shitshow.
---
Perk cards are a bad system to begin with.  This is just amplifying it.
---
The thing is, the playlist keeps getting smaller because their royalty fees keep expiring. And so some tracks get disabled with patches. That's another reason why the station seems to get more and more repetitive as time goes on.
---
Danke
---
Since the patch mine are somehow only doing 20-30 DMG on average. Definitely not just you; confirmed issue
---
Honestly, its necessary for the Xbox if you do any kind of competitive gaming IMO. I bought it only because I was really into PUBG for a time and it was the only way to avoid instances of buildings not loading in. PUBG and 76 are the only two games I ever have problems with crashing.
---
What kind of perks make power armor better? And wouldnt x01 be better than t51? I was just thinking ultracite because it's better for ballistic, which most enemies do
---
Calamities dull the pain of calamities past. Americans today can hearken back to a simpler month when an all out war with Iran seemed to be the worst possible thing that could happen. It makes sense that a Trump is on the Zenimax board of directors.
---
3x Vanguard, 4x Sentinel, 1x Chameleon, 1x Life Saving, 3x AP Regen. Rest is a mix of unwanted stars.
---
I been long pass the "economy" I just enjoy the game with my buddies  and occasionally  joined their private  servers. Vendor hopped here and there to try new weapons and farm the rest. Just taking a break now at the moment and haven't played for about a month or 2. At this point I probably just won't re install the game because for the period I have been playing, its been never ending.  A lot of things that affect my character and builds directly that take so long to fix, im over it. Game is very fun but the cons outweigh  the positives for me.
---
There is a viable dupe method that is active across all platforms.
---
I kinda feel exactly the same way you do but I‚Äôve been feeling like that for a while. The other week I finally rolled a bloodied 25/250 Fixer from the purv and I was ecstatic! Then I traded it for some awesome weapons but then a couple days later I noticed I‚Äôve lost the desire to play until new content comes out. The daily grind has been completed and it‚Äôs kind of just repetitive anymore. So I will be playing BoTW on my switch til the new BoS content comes out.
---
5 more stash boxes I can pack crap into! Yay.
---
I hate nuclear winter score challenges SO goddamn much... I loathe this game mode. I‚Äôve played for 2 hours now and have only managed to find 2 creatures out of 9. Why force us to play this soul crushing game mode that we hate so much? My internet has 700 pings, I absolutely have no chance in this game mode and it‚Äôs bullshit I‚Äôm forced to play it every day for these goddamn challenges.
---
I honestly just wanna fucking cry. This shit is not fun in the least. Being forced to play a battle royale game mode every damn day makes me want to abandoned this game for another six months.
---
I actually have only done that quest once. And I did it about a month ago. I remember being legitimately unnerved by the screaming, so much so, that I took my headset off to make sure that 1: It was actually in game and not somebody screaming outside my house and 2: it seriously made me uncomfortable to hear. Lol
---
I suggest posting on the LFG (looking for group). You will get plenty of help from posting. I look at and post on the LFG for "Encryptid".
---
I find them aesthetically pleasing, but the same classical tunes drives me batty.
---
Okay gonna try it out thank you
---
I was in one like that last night on XBox, hardest fight in a long while. Damn scorched were out of control and the Queen didn't seem hurt but we pulled out the kill in a final minutes.
---
They're not shooting at all for me. Just standing in the way.
---
No, you don't. Over the past week I've gotten over 5K points just from the XP repeatable. You don't need every challenge to reach 100 (I lost 3 weeklies last week to auto completes) and you could still push for more points available in adventure without further neglecting NW. I deemed 4/7 of last week's dailies more time inneficient than just knocking out 30k exp worth of the repeatable challenge.
---
I just stare at my screen in disbelief üò∂ and I'm never sure if I'm thrown out of the game because of the game, or if it's my crappy internet from spectrum. üòÜ
---
&gt; it seriously made me uncomfortable to hear
---
And it goes on and on for such a long time, too. I swear that even most horror movies cannot get screams like that out of their actors.
---
That's not a bug, it's a feature!
---
I‚Äôd say hop servers. It‚Äôs the only real fix.
---
Guilty!  Lol
---
I did it in two also.
---
Walked the fire ring on the bottom of Morgantown. Seem like enough scorpions, bloatflies, ghouls, and dogs around.
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I think they go on top to avoid attack by the scorched mobs she spawns and not because of AoE damage.  Though there is absolutely no consequences to dying in a event anymore so I don‚Äôt know why they worry about it.
---
The survival chem can't be sold through vendors or to NPCs, so I'm assuming they can't be traded. I forgot I had unequipped those perks last night, so I didn't get to test the super chem. I'm assuming it's the same for both chems and the fission grenade. You keep them when switching perks.
---
Good point, I didn't consider the royalty fees and their expiration dates....but they should be able to load a bunch of new (old) songs
---
Between that and the PA challenge I'm just amazed nobody has complained about the photo one yet.
---
Regardless of type of armor?
---
 Maybe your trash at the game, if your build only lets you attack from up close its not up to everyone else to accommodate you, just because your having a hard time does not mean people need to adjust there play style.
---
Have you been to the Alpine River Cabins yet? Oh my sweet summer child you haven‚Äôt seen terror...
---
But yes, the first time I heard it I nearly shit a brick.
---
Ah, didn‚Äôt catch you were all set with the BOS armor. My bad.
---
You can possibly get them from hacking a terminal or killing an Alpha AI.
---
That's been disproven so many times. I don't understand why people still say that line when there are repeatable quest that grant you 100 points. If the NW challenge is 250 points then playing for like 20 minutes gets you that much via the XP repeatable quest.
---
New in Fallout First: Currency Exchange
---
Convert any currency into any other currency. For a small fee.
---
I think the fence and tents thing has been proven to be a myth?
---
personally I do it to avoid getting detected.
---
It‚Äôs Marine chest, marine left arm, sturdy combat right arm, sturdy combat left leg, sturdy combat right leg
---
Edit: 350 DR, 300 ER. Decent numbers Incase I get caught. And 4x sentinel reduces my received damage by 60%
---
Run junkies hunting rifle with 5 addictions
---
Edit2: I‚Äôd like a harder to detect while sneaking piece, but with 3 sneak, 1 chameleon and 15 agi I‚Äôm barely ever spotted. Only if an enemy creeps up on me unaware
---
it's typically to avoid all the trash mobs, it has nothing to do with skill and all to do with tactical placement. The only time it will cause issues with the SBQ is if they are pulling agro. If they are pulling agro maybe you should try having better dps.
---
Just imaging the camper being torn apart by the Wendigo....frightening.
---
Really Nuclear winter???
---
that does make sense lol. well, I suppose it's not the end of the world, we can still make it work. just maybe gotta split up a little more and go our own ways and such, but I think it can still be a good time :3
---
BTW where is survival? oh those servers went to battle royale
---
No, I don't agree with this at all. You don't have to do it at all and you can easily make up the score by doing the repeatable SCORE challenge.
---
Put the ugly metal stairs in an out of the way room, leave one ceiling tile open
---
Then you can use the small coffee table or suitcases, stuff like that to build a spiral staircase by using rugs to stack them
---
This gives a basic explanation but there should be videos and stuff, google Fallout 76 rug stacking
---

Full set of random unyielding and my excavator pa set lol

If you're on XBox - you can lookout for me: GT:  LAWRENCEANDHENR
---
I do 5 - 10 Encryptid per day, usually solo.
---
Ah well. Thank you for checking :)
---
A slight consequence is the never ending death loop of spawning in the nuke zone. Never understood why you can‚Äôt fast travel into it, but they sure will spawn you there!
---
It takes longer to kill her if she doesn't land.
---
Also you deal less damage when she's ey up in the air. And it's super annoying when she does her flyover thingy. Super annoying
---
Lol so?
---
Really?
---
that worked! thanks a bunch!
---
Yeah I see your point but like I said at least your good drops are profitable. The two bloodied FFR RW plasma caster I have or the 3 unyielding WWR AP buff chest I have are worthless as I don't need more than one for 1 character.
---
Dang, going to have to scrap my camp and start again.  That looks drastically better for a multi floor layout then normal stairs
---
Try going to another cell block
---
Haha! Join the club! I don't even try to figure some of this out. Gold bullion? I don't even know what it's for. \*shrugs\*
---
This game has some damn fine voice acting in it. DAMN FINE! 
---
And it saddens me that so many people wouldn't even give it a chance.
---
It's every event. People just running around trying to do everything. Sh!t like "Feed the people". Two people at the event. One will be watching the two lower machines and the other will be running around like a lunatic trying to watch all 3 instead of just planting their arse up at the top and watching the ingredient hopper.
---
Cannot just stand still and guard a specific point. Has to try shoot every level 5/9 mole rat/ghoul in case they miss out on something. All they do is screw everything up and get in the way.
---
All I want is the meat stew.
---
It's definitely still fun. I mean, it *is* still Fallout with friends, and many of us have been wanting that for years.
---
I'm not even phased anymore
---
I don't agree with that all. Destiny does it really well as have a bunch of other games.
---
&gt; There‚Äôs basically no benefit to doing that.
---
Wrong. Up there you don't get hit with her clouds w/o need for acrobatics and breaking aim. And yes when she dives you can land excellent headshots. You should try it sometimes, being the acrobatics hero you claim to be, you wont miss.
---
And even with people standing up there she'll land. 
---
I've been standing there since beta, and in all but a few fights the SBQ landed. Those where she didn't land she was ripped apart before she even had the chance to descend.
---
So I am trash in your eye, I couldn't care less.
---
When you find the broken one the markers disappear. The broken one is all you need, once repaired you can turn the quest in without needing the other 2. Works everytime
---
I'm almost afraid of seeing a way to buy perk coins with atoms down the line. I'd hate to see the results of that.
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about how the ammo can isn‚Äôt a camp plan.
---
Yup, same for me, I kept running into this issue and it did it about 5 times in a row then went weird and all I could see was the in game map, and now the game won't launch from Game Pass at all, xbox app closes and that's it. Won't even run as admin and when I do it says its offline?
---
So confused.
---
The only events that work right in the game are the crashes and the dupes
---
So you get more mobs to kill and get so from, I've seen no difference in the damage I deal when she's in the air or the ground, she going to do the fly over even if no one is on the tent or fence.
---
What was yesterday? The end of the season is what I'm referring to literally. You know when the items you haven't earned have to be bought or you miss out presumably forever.)Although knowing BEthesda they will repeat the same items every other season in a different color.)
---
I don't believe they have published any detail on this, unless someone can show me a dev post. I'm not sure why people are getting their pitch forks for something that isn't out or even been detailed.
---
Perk coins were the last thing I needed to see to understand that the future of this game just isn't for me. I'm not really sure who it's for to be honest, but currency after currency for small updates just doesn't cut it for me. The lack of new content doesn't help either, and the season pass is not what I'd call content.
---
Yes, everyone should change their play style to accommodate you.
---
It‚Äôs not super popular, but it‚Äôs much more doable now thanks to public teams. I finally beat it for the first time ever since the public team update and now have four completions in total. 
---
As others have said check to see what it‚Äôs looking like on the server. Ask yourself these questions before initiating it:
---
- Are there a lot of high levels on the server? 
---
- Are there a decent amount of public events teams formed?
---
- If there are a lot of teams formed, are they actually running events? 
---
Plus with those in mind, also make sure to do it while no other events are happening as well and maybe try to start it up when one ends if a lot of people are participating in it that way you got momentum.
---
Exactly!
---
Hmm.. no INT really has no bearing on how much XP you get. Look into it.
---
Well until they get all the hacks and bugs under control on PC I would rather not have weapon modding. All the hacked, jigsaw weapons in Adventure are bad enough.
---
I read the title and thought this was the POE sub. Then I saw it was fo76, ROFLMFAO.
---
he could have just got disconnected from server error ye know
---
Im having the same issue on gamepass, patiently waiting for a fix...
---
Once you get all perks it becomes a "How many can you get?" situation, making them completely pointless to have. At least let us trade them for something.
---
I broke through the map from the south west corner of the Ash Heap. I was just goofing around exploring and after walking south west for way longer than I expected I opened the map to find myself waaaay on the other side of the river. Walked all the way north to the top of the forest, took a few great loading screen pictures too. My favorite was from across the river looking at Point Pleasant. Unfortunately they were wiped from 76 after I had an SSD issue and had to reinstall. Might still have them saved on my console though.
---
It usually pops up in Wotoga about every hour.
---
I know. But in case it was something else...
---
Dude, legit nearly all the voice acting was beautifully done. All the holotapes you find in Flatwoods are so rich and character and personality.
---
It doesn‚Äôt happen all the time, but more recently, every time I do ‚ÄúBreach and Clear‚Äù the containers are totally empty.
---
Do you guys really think INT factors you XP? Cause if you do you may want to learn the fundamentals of this game...
---
Other Fallout game yes it does, FO76 no it doesn't.
---
So many requests are simply nice to have. A game that just works is essential. VATS is what makes Fallout unique in my view and currently it feels more broken than ever. Struggling to find any enthusiasm to pursue the season pass with the game as it is.
---
He knows about the spice
---
Ah okay thanks, better keep trying. Gotta catch em allüòÇ
---
The only scream I've ever heard worse was Lambert death in Alien.  This one caused flashbacks to it because it sounded so horrible.
---
I feel as if I'm back in time.
---
Those platforms were supported right from the start. What's so new about this?
---
Level 28 half way through so I'm on track that's a relief
---
The cards are nice but as a reward for that much work they're still underwhelming. If maxing a card unlocked a special weapon skin or outfit or backpack skin or something... maybe.
---
Look at the COD WWII prestige system. For each prestige rank you get a special buff, player emblem, token to unlock a locked weapon (or skin was it?)... and this was only for completing 55 levels each time which was about the same work as 55 levels in FO76.
---
Yeah they need to at least give 3 or 4 perk coins per card instead of one and maybe make it so you unlock some special atom shop items (untradeable) for fully ranking a legendary card.
---
Ive been saying the same thing for a while now. It seems like there‚Äôs a lot less music in this game as far as variety on the radio goes. A few new songs, a few from fallout 4, and nothing else. Classical music, same thing.
---
That‚Äôs where I was at when I posted this like I really love playing this game but man what a shit show at times
---
The same shit you do before 100. Hunt legendaries, get boned at the purveyor, and have extra shit legendaries left over you can‚Äôt scrip because limits. (And yes my four other characters are 50+ so good luck with the level up! daily chore)
---
There are no skills to train so you have nothing to show for your time. Perks are a joke and consoles still don‚Äôt have mods like perk presets. 
---
Waste time and caps going to camps with clothing instead of armor or plans that literally everyone has. 
---
Nuke the queen for a shitty one star legendary. Nuke the colossus for a shitty one star legendary. 
---
Watch as people loose their shit over new atom shop content while bugs and glitches since launch have gone largely ignored. 
---
Maybe take a few month break from the game, as I have done many times before, and come back to the same pile of garbage you left. 
---
Do horde events that not a single one of is level 50+. Do events that only a single one rewards endgame level gear. 
---
Spend months earning reputation for settlers or raiders that think we, as players who have spent two years in Appalachia, are the newcomers. Ward is a fucking asshole and has no alternate dialogue. 
---
Miss a day on the legendary run and suddenly your a week behind. 
---
That‚Äôs most of it.
---
Thats the exact location my base is at. Wild, i havent logged on in months
---
This morning I jumped off a ledge to get to a 3* legendary, then I died from fall damage and couldn't respawn. The ole' *you are overencumbered and can't fast travel* when you haven't even respawned bug.
---
Thankfully public teams let me rejoin the same server and I got the kill before the Whitespring Sentries had totally killed the legendary; still super frustrating and kills the enjoyability tho.
---
What I meant by people not caring is the fact that there have been a few posts that can barely break 100 karma. There's comments here and there, but nowhere near the kind of support or traction other major issues have gotten, namely the recent subreddit-wide outrage over the ammo machine. There were multiple posts with thousands of upvotes covering the entire front page. There hasn't been a single post on this issue thats broken out in that way and unfortunately Bethesda seems like they are only willing to respond to great amounts of pushback. 
---
I get that they can't snap their fingers and magically fix things but it's fucked up that something this big goes without an official statement on the situation and reassurance that players affected aren't going to have to grind harder or spend more than people who weren't.
---
And you don't need to win the event for the achievement like the description says, it unlocks just by participating.
---
I was wondering if this happened because it seems like there‚Äôs only like 5 songs now.
---
"The code compile fine fuck it who cares" can you just hear that?
---
If they can figure out how to make them not terrible like the old ones.
---
I just wish there were more instanced places to grind like the burrows personally. Even better if we could solo instance and reset them.

PLEASE for the love of god, listen to your player base... I *LOATHE* being forced to play Nuclear Winter every single day for these score challenges. This game mode is soul crushing. I‚Äôve tried for two hours now and only managed to kill 2 creatures for the daily. This is just horrible. My internet is no where near good enough to play this PVP game mode and having to play it once a day makes me honestly want to cry. 
---
PLEASE replace Nuclear Winter score challenges.
---
Yep I had 2 weight reduction perks, but no unyielding armor. So the only way to prevent it is to not have weight reduction perks?
---
Says the sheep who doesn‚Äôt know a failure of a game even if it slapped you in the face.
---
I'd give 5000 atoms for MIRV nukes that dumps 6 nukes randomly on the map instead of just 1.
---
With unyielding you don't need cham or sneak, the special points are so high that no mob will see you when you crouch.
---
I must say , I love your name!
---
On to what you actually SAID: I totally agree with you. After reading some of the comments (read: complaints) of people on the PTS, I am losing interest very quickly. Scrap it and start over. Maybe with someone on the dev team who either (a) plays the game, or (b) who listens to the people who actually DO play. Then we might not end up with something I am not interested in before it even comes out.
---
Now, this could be pessimism based on other peoples' opinions, and I might love it when I can get my hands on it. But... what if it sucks? It kind of sounds like it might...
---
Oh nice. Thanks!
---
Automatically picking all locks and hacking all terminals should be a basic feature?
---
Haha! I referred to this meme (not yours, specifically) further up the chain! It seems so appropriate right now.
---
They should add that mechanic to the game
---
5* unyielding SS, crouching is enough so no mob will see me. No perk cards needed for that.
---
Wow lol
---
I scrapped all my cards to try to see how much each level cost, but I couldn't find out more than that because my highest character is level 148
---
I thought you got the legendary perk cards every 5 levels?
---
Oh yeah especially since it just auto spawns you in there even if your in a group and could try to get outside of it.  Not a consequence but definitely a pain in the ass though it would really effect bloodied the most.

Didn't you hear? Bethesda dev's don't play video games. Fucking millennial programmers..

Are you reading my mail? You just described my build! Good to know...

So I'm gonna make an edit because I learned some new info.   
---
PC and Windows 10 PC are the same but different. The later "released" today. The Windows 10 has Xbox Achievements but does NOT support cross play with the Xbox One game... making it 3.5 platforms? The Windows 10 version doesn't run the same way as the Steam version but does offer the same group of modders and hackers in the game. Although, i bet its harder to mod or hack the Win 10 applet.
---
Rose is without a doubt my favorite as far as voice acting goes (and character wise too honestly). Her whole story arc was wonderful.

Beth doesn't ban toons, only accounts.

XBLive also doesn't ban accounts from a non-MS game.

You most likely have not renewed your gold-sub.

Yeah its annoying when noobs stand on top of the bunker, on the fence or on a tent. People can more easily take her  down when she lands since its easy to headshot her.
---
Hell even on my sneak commando build I don't bother standing on anything and am never in danger of dying so I don't see why other people do it.
---
In any case this is why you nuke the bunker now. People will still stand on their tents but itll be less and therefore the queen will land more.
---
The last time this challenge popped up it was 3 kills in NW. I just wonder why they pushed it three times as high this time?
---
Fallout 1.5^st Now just 19.99 a month to have the bagpipes removed

If this doesn't prove that BGS doesn't listen to the community, nor

do they even play the same game at this point, nothing will.
---
I found some hacker's camp this morning totally decked out in the end-game Legendary Run rewards, he had the fireplace and everything. It feels like they're practically catering to them at this point; especially with that damn ultra-capsink that was the Mole Miner event.
---
I just died a little on the inside. There is no way I am going to be finishing seasons every time (or  even getting close), so now my soul hurts.
---
No my game has only crashed twice in 70 hours. Check your system stability.
---
Is there a good place to get some to scrap?
---
It's not that hard to kill 9 mobs.  This community sure does whine a lot.
---
The issue with this is that people who have obtained hacked weapons on pc would then bring those hacked weapons to xbox and I dont think anybody wants that.

Jail is a good spot to start, usually some ghouls and it doesn't have much loot so people don't start there.
---
They spawn as the match goes on, so going back over an area you already went will sometimes get you mobs.
---
There is a bonus damage against NPCs CHR perk that helps when you get tougher ones later on like the grafton monster or assaultrons.
---
I just got 10 in 1 match, which I think is my highest.  You should generally be able to average 3 if you don't get ganked right at the start.  Try to start away from other people.
---
There's supposed to be a reason to play past level 50? Don't get me wrong, I AM past level 50, but it got a lot less exciting to level up and feels more grindy than it used to.
---
Like the "legendary" rng crap we get? I think they have taught us to have a low expectation of the word.
---
was more talking about the +3 lock pick and hack being in 1 perk and not taking up a special slot. auto pick/hack should be alike Fallout 3's where you can force it at the chance of breaking your bobby pin
---
Cause 3 was too easy
---
did you log in for mods on fo4 or skyrim?
---
What platform you on?
---
3rd floor right outside elevator. 3 potential spots. 
---
-on beds in each of the rooms with cots in them
---
-on bench in bathroom outside showers.
---
I'm not 100% sure but you may need to progress fully through the Brotherhood questline?  If you already have then that very much sucks, the RNG on it is veryyy all over the place.  Some people get all the skins quickly, other people have been playing since beta and haven't earned it yet.
---
I did actually. Alot. Here my guide I posted and at the bottom you'll see a nice video evidence for your viewing pleasure. Stay informed and stay healthy

On one server if you have all 3 sets of codes you can lunch three nukes, One from each silo
---
There is a player in the server cool down I don‚Äôt know the exact however 
---
This thread Will help explain the cool downs
---
Edit: unless someone has already launched one from the silo

---
Yeah my Gauss rifle started healing enemies today...smh.
---
I can understand a daily here and there to entice new players to try but I agree it shouldn't be a 1000 score weekly
---
They are all "easy" I don't think any of em are designed that way. It was plenty, and well in line with other dailies.
---
So I'm on ps4 but I'm sure its similar and I dont know you $$ situation but for all games upgrading you harddrive to a ssd for around 80-120 dollars is the smartest move ever.
---
I was stuck at a computer terminal at Mama Dolce's for nearly 5 mins because of the stupid issue with the game needing you to be PERFECTLY ALIGNED in order for it to go through the tedious animations before you get to the actual terminal screen.  I had to have a friend come over and try to nudge me until the "game" bothered to let me go. 
---
Can't even count how many times I've crashed either during or while running over to get loot from SBQ.  There's so many stupid little bugs in this game that if you don't learn to become numb to it, you'll go legit insane. Don't even get me started on CAMPS and greens but NOOOOO item is floating....  For the love of Todd, FIX YOUR SHIT BETHESDA!
---
I was actually considering an SSD! I run and load all of my games from an external so I assume as long as it is USB 3.0 it should work out fine. If it wasn't so late into the console gen I would even consider replacing the internal with an SSD just for kicks!
---
Agreed but you are talking about Bethesda.
---
either you logged off, or there's a reason you don't want to answer the question. Which makes me think your reasons are probably a personal preference in how you want to play the game over anything serious.
---
I agree. Run a true RPG party. Tank, healer, dps, support
---
My TV stereo is all sorts of funky sometimes, occasionally voices get VERY loud. Was pretty sure I freaked out my neighbors with this event.
---
when I tested it on the PTS when it first came out, I was able to add and remove my legendary perks freely without an issue and only being at level 250 (was most likely a bug but thought it was a feature).  the perks should be able to be removed and added at no charge like normal perks. it is supposed to be a high tier reward not a grinding punishment that it is  in the PTS
---
You can‚Äôt trigger it AFAIK. I‚Äôve played it 3 times in the past week though.
---
Some, but not everyone.  And I feel overall, more people would get exp VS people who are trying but ppl with Godroll items just 1 shot everything in 1/2 a second.
---
I know you were posting this to slam Bethesda's marketing tactics, but thanks for posting this. I didn't know this was a thing. Just bought it.
---
Some of us actually don't have issue with spending real money on something we consider a hobby. 
---
You are completely entitled to your own opinion. But I've already got my initial investment monies worth of playtime, and I'm more than happy to support the company to keep the game running. Bugs and all.
---
That's ok, your comment got me searching and I found someone who said it's 100,150,200 for max rank, making each card 450 coins or 30 levels per card extra. 180 extra levels overall vs my posts numbers for six cards. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Who it was intended for really shouldn't have mattered (except maybe on the points cap). The terminal interface is exceedingly unfriendly, particularly once you get past 2 layers deep. It's all great and thematic for unlocking stuff and seeing bits of lore and story, but it should never be used as a primary interface that players are going to be using regularly.
---
"I said alms, you backbiter!"
---
That guard is obviously able to still walk and run and use a weapon. I know this because they have (tried to) use them in the past. He could still save Tamriel if he wasn't so darn lazy. I mean, if I can do it, he can! I'm just some random Wood Elf who showed up under shady circumstances!
---
You're completely right, I have always been in all the various sagas of Fallout, my characters have always been power armor only and i love power armor.  I totally agree with you
---
Low key this is my favorite one so far ü§£
---
Alright thanks. And where‚Äôs the elevator again? I forgot lol
---
Few games have really done cross save correctly.
---
Look at the state of this game and tell me with a straight face that Bethesda wouldn't fuck it up.
---
Asking them to develop a cross save solution would be the fastest way to get everyone's save files deleted, corrupted or just misplaced.
---
Nothing is more annoying when people are just idle, and don't help kill other enemies. Then they complain about not getting a hit on the legendary. I will melt every legendary as soon as I deem no one is helping. No cares.
---
I just consider it a nuke ending my shit at this point.. for rp purposes.
---
Improving that UX wasn't a high bar to hurdle.
---
they need to at least give us the atoms to buy up the ranks we lost.
---
I agree.  It's kind of charming and it's sooo freakin easy.  a few minutes a day for free stuff.
---
Also I want the other neon colors.
---
Do you feel useful
---
Yea for sure a year and a half wasn't enough for them to fix stuff lets give them another 3 years before they add content
---
Really? I don't have an Xbox. Husband and I are PC people, with the PS on the side, but it's mainly a blu-ray player. Is the storage so small that you have to have an external? *totally baffled at the idea*
---
I don't know, these past 7 months have been shit, so everything's kind of blending together, and as a result of this, i've become numb to this type of thing.
---
Personally, I really like that idea because I am lazy and I don't want to start over when I play on different systems. But, I feel like - if this was easy, they would have done it already. There's more variables to consider.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt know what your talking about. My CAMP is beautiful and you can‚Äôt say otherwise, well you can, but I think you‚Äôre wrong.
---
Bethesda should then take action to ban people with hacked weapons
---
Ohh yeah, true true. I don't get crazy (I've seen some insane places) But I could see how that could be an issue.
---
Tr#de for it
---
Any weapon with an atomic shop skin is unsellable
---
Healing hands to troll bloodied builds.
---
I share aquaboy because its the only one i can.
---
XP gives score thanks to the repeatable weekly.
---
Line in the Sand can be finessed with a 1st tent to have all the mobs spawn right on top of the klaxon.   You then shoot them all with AE damage of some sort to get XP from all of them.
---
Last time I did it I got 3 levels and 3k steel scrap in the 10 or whatever minutes it took.  Took longer looting the bodies and scrapping the weapons than killing the mobs.
---
but what would keep you ingame for  15000 hours to get 1/5 armor pieces then?
---
Exact same issue here.
---
Why would they do that? That's so stupid.
---
They could but I think they also have to tackle the ability to actually produce these weapons because they do the bans in waves and not just if someone so happens to have one.
---
Surely Bethesda will destroy it if you touch it even with a finger, I fully agree with you
---
I get the gist of what you are saying, but I don't understand the reason you single out the most useless perk for this.
---
Poison resistance... I've been playing since beta and died my fair share, yet poison was not even once the cause.
---
It kind of is tbh.  Considering it crashes more on console than it does on PC.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie lol
---
It's absolutely hilarious reading some of the comments who either don't realize you're messing around AND/OR prove your point exactly lol
---
There isn't a NW photo challenge for score.
---
Yeah, I'm not running chameleon, but I do run sneak mostly because I had it before I got my unyielding gear. I'll have to try it out without sneak but I've got free agility points right now with adrenaline broken.
---
Yeah the HUD shows up and I can see the map, sometimes. Can still launch the game though, that's odd.
---
Is crashing a common issue for people?
---
3 times, one for each silo, then a cooldown.
---
&gt;All because those people won‚Äôt get off the fence and let her land.
---
This argument is wrong, for two reasons
---
1. This is a problem with the game, not the players sitting on the fence.  It's a broken game mechanic.  Sitting on the fence should not effect her landing. The fact that it does effect her landing is a problem with the game, and not the players.   This game won't improve if  people   blame players  for problems caused by developers.  You are basically blaming players for not using a work around, which should not be necessary
---
2. Crippling perks don't work on the queen anymore.  Bethesda said this is not intentional and that they are aware of it, and they have not bothered to fix it. The queen stopped landing as much because it's impossible to cripple her. Once again, the problem is a broken game mechanic, not a problem with players.
---
I don't stand on fences or suvival tent, but that isn't the point here. The queen not landing is really a problem with the game itself.  Staying off the fence to make sure she lands  is a work around for a broken game mechanic. And work arounds should never be necessary. The game should really just be working correctly, and it is not working correctly. That is the real problem.
---
*was
---
nice to hear i hope it will work for me again someday :)
---
Had a very similar event last night. I was doing 'Feed the people' (one of my favorite events because it's pretty easy &amp; gives a pretty decent consumable) &amp; the game locked up when I had to use the terminal. Luckily, some people showed up &amp; while I fixed the problem by fast traveling, they took care of the console...Then we had to use the terminal again...&amp; guess what...It locked up again, this time for one of the randoms helping me...The only time I've ever failed that event. We just had to run out the clock, because no one could use the terminal. Yeah...I just moved on &amp; scoffed a bit. But you know what, I love this game for some reason...At least this game is making an effort to improve, unlike other luke warm mmos. *cough* Destiny 2 *cough* Sorry about that. I think my fingers have a cold.
---
Does it still count if you use the drug youre addicted to?
---
I also don't want to waste much time in video games but I think maybe they haven't considered adding it
---
I started last Thursday and I'm already level 21 or 22. The one before ghillie armor. Its not hard, and you barely have to go out if the way to complete the challenges.
---
Black goes with everything
---
$$$$$
---
Ah those things , ruined my everyday
---
Manhunt event or just go to Grafton Damn.  I got the supermutants and power armor done in under 5 minutes.  If there isn't anything there just server hop.  Doable by level 10s, although it will take longer dealing with supermutants at that level.
---
I had the same level up bug happen. What was the other one that bugged. I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs a bug that affects everyone‚Äôs same goals.
---
Because the skin is an atom shop purchase and they're not transferable.
---
I ran into some guy selling the fixer plan for 5k on a vendor and bought it so I don't have to buy stuff for the damn cards all the time, I figured I was saving caps. I do want that sheepsquatch outfit though...
---
No I did not. Never played those
---
So it‚Äôs really just a local
---
Loading time issue?  I assumed that it was all server-side.  Doesn‚Äôt feel like that much it needs to load up locally just to render view.
---
I ask about this the other day answer I got was playing NW will break the map boundaries.
---
Ugh who cares? Just give us the perk system PTS is such a small niche of the community.
---
Same thing goes with power armor.
---
Because it has a skin someone paid atoms for.   Bes ain‚Äôt letting someone who hasn‚Äôt spent the atoms to have atoms items.
---
i would post a picture but i cant, translatet to english its kinda:
---
"NW: use photomode to shot a picture"
---
There should be a lot more repeatable quests in the game period. Duchess and The Wayward are just a starts.
---
The faction daily quests, both factions should have more people to give quests, in Foundation's case this is even hinted at in Ward's dialogue "Ask around to see who needs help". Off the top of my head I can think of Penny, any one of the US Army guys recruited for the vault raid, Paige and Jen has been established through dialogue to be a scavver who goes around hunting for various things and scouting the area. Why not make it so that we can encounter her in the world and assist her in her endeavors?
---
Crater? Well there's Meg, Weasel, Gail and/or RaRa, the one guard you can sell photos of Foundation to, I've forgotten her name, Johnny or the Ghoul whose name I've forgotten, in addition to Rocksy and Wren.
---
With The Overseer and Davenport's Photo quests, why do they obsess about the two factions? Are there not other things around Appalachia that need regular monitoring? Dams for instance, There are two of them that I'm aware of Grafton and Crevasse, neither of which has received any maintenance for the two and a half decades since the bombs fell and indeed have been taken over by bands of Super Mutants. Shouldn't they be monitored? (Lower levels get sent to Grafton higher levels to Crevasse). How about sending us out to keep an eye on The Blood Eagles? of the Raiders in the game, the Raiders at Crater are much tamer than The Blood Eagles.
---
Ally quests. In general they're OK but I think that the Rescue a Settler type quests should come from Foundation and not our Ally/Companion.
---
Sorry this has turned into a rant of sorts, but it's just irritating that they've established these characters with some interesting back stories and after their initial quests are finished, they're basically never heard from again in any meaningful way.
---
I dont want to make a whole post about this because there are so many but I have about 10 hours in this wasteland and I am loving it so far! My first fallout game and boy am I glad I finally pulled the trigger. Id love to hear any tips or tricks that may help me along, currently level 11 on pc. Thanks for not being a shitty community as well :D
---
they should try to ban those who have many hacked weapons and to eliminate hacked weapons to those who have only one
---
The gold "Scabber" skin looks pretty cool, but I did end up preferring matte black
---
Today‚Äôs the day üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ
---
Yeah I got the fixer plan twice before I got the impostor outfit. 
---
I've had trouble getting anything but fedoras and assaultron head plans lately but I shall persevere. There are worse ways for clearing out caps before limit.
---
That or hope old Bethesda fixes it. It doesn't happen all the time. I run a complete Unyelding set and only hit the bug on laggy queen fights or imposter events.
---
That there is some next-level penny pinching
---
I'm not sure if there are "always" spots for power armor, although there are a huge number of spots where there usually is power armor.  It's an incredibly easy "challenge."
---
No offense but fuck that event. The second I load in I insta die, doesn't matter what armor or perk cards.
---
There‚Äôs a lot you‚Äôre saying that I don‚Äôt understand but are you on PC and running any mods?
---
Sir, have you taken your chill pill today? Just calm down. If you don‚Äôt enjoy the game, that is perfectly fine. You aren‚Äôt bound here, you‚Äôre free to leave. But remember that when you go there are people that still enjoy the game, so don‚Äôt leave raining on our parades.
---
Legendary perks will be for poison and upgrade power armor
---
&gt; Unyielding armor with a mix of chameleon. 
---
Then I must have understood you wrong. :)
---
Enter building. Go through doors on left. Immediate right. And through laser grid.
---
If that's your only weapon then its not too much.
---
My heavy is currently carrying 14 weapons, and I'm carrying 20,000 5mm (gatling/minigun), 25,000 .50 (50 cal), 10,000 .308 (LMG), 5000 ultracite .308 (primed LMG), 5000 ultracite .50 (primed last word), 2000 primed plasma (primed plasma caster), 3000 fuel (flamer), 40 fusion cores  for gatling laser (40,000 rnd with power user), 25 ulracite cores (25,000 for primed gatling laser), 35 ultracite plasma cores, 7000 2mm (guass mini) and 3000 ultracite 2mm (primed gauss)
---
Got to love bear arms + bandolier + batteries included.
---
It's enjoyable when you aren't getting fucked by the auto-completion bug. Then it's just discouraging and depressing
---
It's not supposed to be, take your picture in adventure mode, sounds like it says NW when it shouldn't
---
Hope it works :)
---
It also bothers me that Cheshire *exists.* You know, that woman in the suspenders next to Mort? She‚Äôs supposed to help you if your rep gets low. 
---
*How the fuck do you lower rep that much? It‚Äôs physically impossible.*
---
Idrc about atoms, thanks for the info tho really helps
---
Pretty sure you can play GTA in Foundation/Crater
---
lol thanks, it worked in adventure mode !
---
I apologize for not making it clear. First to answer your question I am on Xbox one X. I have no mods of any sort. Essentially in its simplest form I am unable to access or even see a large number of perk cards but I know should be there. And I don‚Äôt know the cause or the solution
---
It's definitely not a NW challenge today. It's a normal game mode challenge today, the NW challenge is kill 9 creatures.
---
Happy to hear it :)
---
I would love to go on another quest with the two hired guns (I've forgotten their names because after the initial quests I haven't interacted with them at all) especially the robot, as in my main's game I gifted her with a Protectron body, and she was not happy with it.
---
Uh... What?
---
I must be oblivious to the consequences of standing on the fence but the sole reason I‚Äôve done and continue to do it is because of the mobs of scorched enemies in the tall grass chewing on me while my eyes are on the Queen. Especially those Mirelurk spawn, one no big deal, but 100 of them will strip the flesh off your bones in seconds. Plus I‚Äôve never experienced any issues with me being on the fence: she flies she lands she dies event over
---
Sending a friend request
---
The safes are in the same spots as Adventure mode.  Spawn at, say, the mothman cult house, 2nd floor safe, challenge complete, then convenient cliff right there to jump off of.
---
I'm not that smart but this thing kicks some serious ass.  No more doing a crossword or taxes while camp hopping.
---
That‚Äôs really a personal preference isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôm looking forward to blood eagle skin.
---
Ah I see üôèüèº
---
The one at the prison you have to go into a different building to find the other vacuum tube. One is in the solitary building and the other two are in the main building
---
Every time I quit the game for a few weeks, it's because of this reason.
---
Are you telling me you don‚Äôt have a single set of power armor? I have six.
---
Yeah, realistically this will take most people over an hour.  Even NW vets can get unlucky and take that long.
---
Especially when it‚Äôs to KILL 9 CREATURES
---
Had my last moment like that today. Uninstalled the game.. too fed up with all this bs.
---
Doubt it around 80% of public teams are all afk or doing nothing over all.
---
I've always ignored the story in GTA and tried to get five stars as fast as possible to see how long I could survive, I thought everyone played that way
---
this aged well
---
Haha not bad mate! Bashing damage could be better but not a bad gat!
---
No, I did recommend a mix, but I personally run full unyielding. I was just agreeing that you were correct that full unyielding is all you really need.
---
Check server for high lvl players.    Still doesn‚Äôt mean it will get done but ur chances are better.  
---
Start the event but don‚Äôt recall the card right away.   Let people get a chance to finish or setup for that event.
---
So you play NW, and on that same day, you can go beyond the border? That's weird.
---
Are you in NW? Your cards won't show up there. Different card system. If you're not in NW, dunno.
---
Post a screen shot
---
I used an ammo one once in the early days, before I realized that ammo for my shotty basically grows on trees and hardly anyone seems to pick it up. The ONE plus to the shotgun nerf.
---
I don't even know what half of that stuff is and I'm not sure I want to find out
---
Well this really only effects Bloodied builds like myself since poison and an Assaultron's Laser Beam are the only things that really kills me.
---
Honestly I don't mind dieing because in events you keep your junk so it just one of the cons of being at such low health.
---
They aren‚Äôt helping man.  Us players that play clean get screwed by everyone.
---
You can‚Äôt ‚Äúfill up‚Äù available cards that I‚Äôm aware of (my main is level 420 and they keep coming), and there are no ‚Äúauto awarded‚Äù cards unless you mean perk packs. Do you see some cards up top and a row on the bottom? Are you saying the row on the bottom is missing some cards?
---
This is contrasted by the jovial tone of Ronnie's version... and then compounded by the fact that Ronnie was probably also eaten alive by Nia shortly after singing his song about bugs.
---
Mine is Dream_McFury lol
---
The reason why people complain is because they do not want to play NW at all. I personally don't want to touch it because it feels like a prototype of a BR. If i want to play  a BR i will play cod, not a fallout mmo lol. I only complete the super easy challenges in NW, and i make up for the lost SCORE by farming experience.
---
But yeah, i get what you mean
---
&gt;no way 4.5 lbs is 90% lighter
---
Yeah, got a damn 6.5 pound gun that is 90% lighter.  And I have 20% reduced weapon weight armor on.  Yeah... no.  Bloody Bethesda.
---
Well, the bashing damage is a legendary stat.  I have not modified the weapon yet
---
That‚Äôs what I heard. I‚Äôll try this this evening and report back.
---
The NW ones can be annoying, but yeah,  I like it. Its a solid notion.
---
What level are you? Have you been picking perks at every level-up?
---
You are exempt from my scorn!
---
I honestly don‚Äôt remember since I haven‚Äôt played in a while
---
I had a similar thing with my friend but at cranberry bog, he could cross the fence and ran into the woods that you can see, but he was a lower level than me so I just thought it was a glitch, but I mean they might add more stuff onto the map but who knows.
---
I sent a request. Killer-Soldier1.
---
I‚Äôm in it for the wallpapers and the monkey stein. I gotta get that monkey stein.
---
Any face covering will do
---
It's fun when you have the mindset that you probably won't get 100% of the rewards and that is entirely okay
---
Welcome to the respawn glitch
---
I run around 95% of the time by myself, its totally doable.
---
Legendary modules only cost 50 so "god roll" gauss shotguns are pretty easy to come by.
---
this bug has been around forever, ruined my first Scorched earth event.
---
You don‚Äôt have to do it. It‚Äôs just another way for those who do to get extra SCORE. You don‚Äôt have to do any daily challenges if you don‚Äôt want to, just grind XP all the way.
---
Not a fan of commies, but that olive drab skin is sweet.
---
I was thinking about the internal one. I don't know how that would work with the consoles operating system if its seperate from that, since im on pc. SSDs are dirt cheap at the moment and will prob. drop in price even more due to their nature of not having mechanic parts and relatively easily produced. I picked up 500gb for 30 ‚Ç¨ recently. So if you want to keep your ps4 for longer and dont wanna upgrade to the new one right away, it might still be worth a thought imho.
---
There are some awesome builds on r/fallout76settlements :)
---
The biggest thing I can recommend is don't try to make your building unreasonably large, the more wall decorations, furniture and stuff you have budget for the better it will look, you don't want a tonne of empty space
---
It's my favorite melee weapon as well, because it's so ridiculously large and dangerous looking.  The Deathclaw Gauntlet hits harder, but the MMG is a lot more badass.
---
Maybe, maybe not. I'm not a game developer but when I am developing websites, sometimes shit just doesn't work.
---
I haven't played NW after the first month or so after it launched, but honestly the NW daily quests are nothing, just a bit of waiting. Especially the place CAMP 3 times type quests. Spawn into NW as far from other players as possible (I always choose the most remote area of the map away from any kind of point of interest) and then just run and deploy my CAMP 3 times in a row, boom quest done, Leave the world or stay in for XP. It's done and over with in about 20 minutes
---
The fairness of the deal is irrelevant.
---
The rules of this sub don‚Äôt allow this kind of post. 
---
You could post ‚ÄòI like kangaroos‚Äô and the same thing would apply. That post would violate the rules of the sub (not related to Fallout 76). 
---
Another rule is ‚ÄòNo Trading Posts‚Äô. 
---
It‚Äôs not a matter of if the deal is good or not. It‚Äôs a matter of such posts **not being allowed at all here.**
---
And based on your post history, you know the subs to go to. And you‚Äôve read **their** rules because you‚Äôre using their required format. 
---
Show some respect and read the rules of this sub as well.
---
&gt; or, more commonly now, Xp farming the bots and ignoring the objective.
---
Seen that a few times now.
---
My first experience with that was when a bunch of level 100+ players were all sitting on the roof of the cabin and staying there. I thought I'd play my part and tank all 3 pylons, but I quickly realized these other guys weren't even shooting at the Assaultron. They were just shooting at all the Gutsies and Eyebots, and I was wasting stims over nothing.
---
Pretty frustrating. I buggered off and left them to it.
---
I know it‚Äôs killing me
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad weapon. Very very good for the scrip I must say! Just imagine it had FFR instead though! 
---
I do wish I could get a good weapon from that place. I‚Äôve tried a load of times but the Purveyor does not want to be my friend...
---
I'll probably test that myself as well. Let me know what you find out.
---
Also try to pick a theme, I based mine on a Private Detective Agency
---
Do you post that comment on everyone who complains about this? Since it seems to be every third person or so? I mean, yes, but OP isn't the only person who's salty about it.
---
What this guy said , I always tend to keep to a small to mid size build and just chuck alot of Wall Decorations at it, works out alot better
---
That's what I'm thinking with all that area to the West, same with the bog. I'd be awesome to see what they do with it!
---
It‚Äôs a bug Beth claimed they fixed but never actually fixed.
---
Before Bethesda adds any more mechanics into, or tied to Nuclear Winter, they should really do something about the abundance of all kinds of hackers. Especially now that we are semi-forced into doing Nuclear Winter at all, to get those 250 S.C.O.R.E. points each day.
---
Then, once they've figured out how to stop hacks from working (I can see the names of several different hacking tools just by running a Google search), they should really go ahead and add that proper solo mode, where there are no groups at all, as an option.
---
PA with emergency protocol, healing factor &amp; speed demon mutations, max life giver perk.  
---
Keep on moving and u can tank basically anything
---
yup had similar suspicions that they intended something else but couldn't get it to work. The two devices aren't even connected in any way except the invisible force keeping them next to each other, if you look at them they even have different names.
---
Meh it's pretty standard
---
it's just 30 years, fo76 takes place 30 years after the nukes.
---
Same. I‚Äôm in it for the monkey stein.
---
Never typed that before!
---
yeah, like adrenaline
---
Well, I guess at least 96% of the people who read this kinda do care :D
---
And no, we don't need legendary perks in their current implementation. It's so badly designed system I can't believe they still refuse to acknowledge its flaws.
---
Just try it on pts and you'll see it's a total flop as it is.
---
Oh sure add a whole new dynamic I can‚Äôt figure out. Lol. I‚Äôll figure it out.
---
Yes, I forgot about Smiley, but you can get 300 gold weekly for 6k caps. That‚Äôs helps out nicely as well.
---
I spent the last hour running all over the damn map looking for creatures and only found four. People have been camping by monsters waiting for people looking for them. I'm level 75 in NW and it sucks.
---
Any time I stay in a whitesprings nuked zone for too long it happens and I keep reporting the crashes to sony....I just hope someone on the other end is reading them and getting a kick out of it because I keep trying to joke about it especially because it happens atleast 1-2 times a week lol examples being "oh no worries here I expected it when I launched a nuke here" or "me again just taking my usual crash, hope all is well"
---
Whats funny about putting a little twanger in your mouth and plucking it?
---
Sounds like Campfire Tales.
---
32, here is a good resource for measuring your progress.

I think a type of ammunition counts as a currency now 5.56 rounds or something
---
There's the perk that heals allies whenever you use a stimpack in the meantime 
---
You can get tons of stimpacks if you run around collecting from those green scorched corpses
---
LOL!  Yes, you are.  :)
---
True I dint think of that lmao
---
Dupers are everywhere in pc , I can't see you being banned for picking up a duped item because how are you supposed to know where it's come from?
---
After 1,172 hours it‚Äôs part of your life
---
Duping happens on PC more often than console because it‚Äôs easier. On Console you have to use an unintended glitch. On PC, not so much. 
---
As far as acquiring a duped item?  It‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll get in trouble for picking something up. Granted, if you have 100k Stable Flux you might get noticed. 
---
But picking up a random drop from a loot bag or vendor?  Highly doubtful.
---
Nah mate. 3* is the way to go. At least for me, I‚Äôm level 350 I don‚Äôt really want 2* garbageüòï
---
Were you duping?
---
It's called "Tempering"
---
Oh it‚Äôs really sad to hear that
---
This was announced in todays ITV - interface for buying/selling is streamlined, you can store 100,000pts instead of 2000, and will be able to buy/sell in 10x and 100x stacks
---
I have a super fast swing speed with mine, that was one of the legendary plus points, 40% swing speed. Then pair that with the lovely spped boosting perk, plus Talons mutation. Oof. My combat knife is amazeballs too with enemies under lvl 50. It does 108dmg + bleed with the serated mod. It could do more but I'd need to equip my one-handed perks to boost it. It's instigating too so the 1st hit is double dmg. They've done cosmetics for that, so IDK why they won't give MMG that extra special attention.
---
The negative coverage is good. Hopefully it leads to major improvements for next season. Its great that you enjoy it. Hopefully if they make the many needed changes you'll be able to enjoy it more casually.
---
I'm in it for the space wallpapers, so I am not stressed like everyone else. There's enough shit going on in the world to be stressed about.
---
SS Armor with Weightless or Chameleon.  Also get a Instigating rifle - helps with that first sneak shot.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm waiting for a practical one like ‚ÄúCrouch motionless in a bush for minutes [0/15]‚Äù.
---
Because that‚Äôs the way I roll.
---
Did you seriously "do the math" on maxing out EVERY single available card?  Who the fuck would EVER do something like that in the first place and why should Bethesda build the system around the idea that people should ever be able to?
---
No, I should clarify, I heard there was a big dupe wave and I was wondering if it messed my stuff up.
---
Your attitude on this makes me so happy! Keep being awesome, and have an upvote.
---
25, about half way to the next one. 
---
I think slightly behind, but I'm not doing the NW challenges. If I get to 100, great, if not at least I get some cool stuff along the way...
---
Honestly, it's way better than forcing us to kill other players in a mode filled with hackers and in which death means more than 5 minutes lost in the freaking Vault each time you want to join a match.
---
A lot of things about Nuclear Winter have to change before me and many other Adventure players start considering getting more involved with the mode than stricly necessary.
---
Right now I have two small 2-story buildings, one housing my NPC, crafting stations and vending machines and the other going to be my home once I furnish it but then I see all these actual buildings and I want something like those but no idea how to build it
---
34
---
Totally agree with you here , I was getting pretty bored before the update and it makes me want to log on every day and grind away to get the rewards
---
The issue is that not everyone likes the grind. Its great that you do. Hopefully next season they make it even slightly less of a grind.
---
I wouldnt find it that bad if they simply made events give score. Or make levels after 50+ give score. Or just make it in any way a little easier to get score.
---
Yes. In fact the row in Perception only has 1 card and 6 empty slots
---
These people wouldn't exist if the rewards weren't classed as atomic shop items. While, yes, I do occasionally play that mode, it is a massive grind to get the skin I want. If that means I have to hid to gain the XP needed then so be it.
---
My question is why did Bethesda add a battle royale in the first place?
---
Oh, I see.  thanks for clarifying
---
But they always seem to choose the worst, most grindy option, so OF COURSE all cards would get decreased instead of increased.
---
 I played GTA SA for years after beating 100%. Just wondering around was fun.
---
I was enjoying it too, but was a little peaved last night when I logged in and saw that all of my dailies except the NW lockpick one were already registered as having been completed. First time since the season was rolled out that I got hit with this bug.
---
4 Bolstering/1 optical secret service armor pieces, but I play mixed rifleman\unarmed build.
---
My PSN is Unknown87654
---
I think you‚Äôre in a good spot for just ten days into the run.
---
Thank you very much! It really helps
---
She doesn't want to be LOTS of peoples friend.
---
Level 81 but that didnt make me any smarter;) 
---
Yes I have been previously. Now I am trying to move some points to customize my build.
---
Most (not all) people who complain about the grind have been mindlessly grinding XP for the repeatable challenge (by the admission of more than one on this very subreddit), and in a week or two when they are 100% done with the Run they'll complain there's nothing left to do in the game.
---
It happens every single time.
---
Nice! Thank You for this. I do enjoy this but it‚Äôs definitely a grind for me because I practically work all day and I actually have to schedule myself time to do the legendary run at night now these days.
---
Damn, wish I was on
---
 drumforlife88, what instrument do you play? :)
---
I‚Äôve missed 2 NW so far but yea I‚Äôm there with you
---
I doubt it. The dupe doesn‚Äôt involve other people or vending machines. 
---
Submit a ticket. Bethesda is extremely unlikely to read this post or take any action for you here.
---
Meat week, prime meat that expires by time, an i need to farm a few to get a nice combo going, yup crashes an blue screened alot
---
Counterpoint on the invisible Imposter: shooting her even when cloaked can fill my health bar if I'm running a Vamp weapon. Useful if I'm holding pylons, but agreed that otherwise its a waste of ammo.
---
Ha Ha.   If there were legendary Fixers, I would not be the only at the event.  :)
---
Hmm, I see. Thank you
---
19 over here
---
I wasn't a fan at first but I'm enjoying it. I was getting kind of bored just doing the usual daily and weekly quest. I have met several awesome people by joining up on a team. And I was adamantly a solo player before. Plus, some of the legendary run stuff is cool.
---
Very sus
---
Yup, my work hasn't opened up yet so i assume my progress will slow down once i start working.
---
The Screaming Eagle is perfect. Makes it look like the OG Service Rifle from FNV
---
This is honestly the worst game ever released. It is broken in so many ways and it doesn‚Äôt reward time well spent. At all. If you can‚Äôt see that then yeah have fun. But Bethesda treats its playerbase like shit and if you can‚Äôt see that then you‚Äôre blind as shit. They don‚Äôt communicate whatsoever. And they don‚Äôt fix obviously glaring issues. They patched duping so hard that they forced duper‚Äôs into the RWT market. Bethesda has t changed the game engine in ten years and they expect it to be good enough for multiplayer. It‚Äôs a sick fucking joke.
---
Thanks, I'll give it a try.   
---
It sounds like I get to relive my EQ2 housing days.
---
The RNG from crafting is the same for drops, except the type/slot of gear.  There would still be grinding. 
---
The time-gating could go away and people would still spend as much time playing, possibly more. 
---
This is a situation in which the time-gating makes no sense.
---
Her screams don't bug me.   The screams/screeches you hear during Monster Mash.....   ugh.  Something straight out of a horror movie.
---
Anthem. Lol. Not saying much but level 1 guns did more than max level legendaries
---
Me too, given how casual I play it's dead easy. The easy team building is a breeze, I'm also enjoying being in a team and basically still playing solo but randomly getting cap drops. It's great.
---
 Its hard to survive the other players long enough to do it
---
I've got 175 hours of game play in so far (noob, I know), and I don't recall the game ever actually crashing for me.   I've gotten booted from servers a bunch of times, but usually right after I log on.   I don't think I've ever had an event or anything like that interrupted part way through.
---
Now that I write this, of course it's going to happen.
---
I honestly hate every aspect of nw. So I just decided I wouldnt be getting at of the rewards from it. And if that also means I don't get to the end of the score board then so be it. Not going to play something I hate for mostly. Cosmetic items. And they way it seems if I really won't something it will eventually be in the atom store.
---
You‚Äôre kidding right lol. PC duping has been happening for months
---
Because that's why I spec into Explosives. Grenade Launcher and Bows are my best friends
---
I love having new goals every day and I was only playing event weeks and double xp weekend for a while, even let my ps plus expire for a few months. So I'm really enjoying it.
---
Got the saucer jungle gym thing and it's so big, I'm going to have to rebuild my camp to use it, which will give me something to do eventually.
---
As far code goes, technically correct is not just best correct, it is only correct. If it's not assigned, then it's just another stash item to the code. They really need to not drop item assignment when moving the camp. They save all of the other relational data; why not that?
---
They seemed to work for me, I'm on PC.
---
Just remove the skin, same thing you can't drop anything with a ATOMIC shop skin, has been like this since day 1
---
Yeah lvl 260 something, and i've completed it along time ago sadly :(
---
27 here
---
Thanks for posting this. I found it elsewhere, but this has been one of my essential building hacks. It saves so much space, and makes builds look way better.
---
If that's what you want it really is easiest to pick a theme
---
I'm working on a general store kind of build on an alt right now, so I've got weapon displays on the walls and heavy weapon displays forming aisles in the middle, with a couple of the glass case displays (empty so far) and vending machines at the back
---
I got the Slocum's Joe doughnut vendor so I'm going to stock it full of Fasnacht donuts and coffee and set it up to look like a kiosk you'd see in a variety store or gas station
---
If you think of a theme and want some ideas let me know :) I'll see what I can come up with
---
I went inside last night after Line in the Sand to scrap the Scorched weapons. Figured I‚Äôd check for ammo bags while I was there, but since there were about 8-10 other players that had been in the area, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much.
---
I got the ammo bags. Also picked up a Green Outfit in the shower area on the bench, IIRC. 
---
You never know what will be there.
---
24 I think, or whatever level the flying saucer is. Seems you are on a decent pace. I've gotten all dailies and weeklies so far with the exception of today and also missed out on 1750 from yesterday when I got smacked by the dailies being pre-completed bug when I logged in. I also haven't been grinding the xp repeatable, but gotten about 1500 from it so far while leveling a new character.
---
I mean... It's not like just six cards isn't insane by itself. 
---
Many Fallout fans are completionists. There's no reason I shouldn't include it just for perspective. It's not like it changes the cost of just the six.
---
Also, to really get down in dirty, that was based on the 16 original and 400 coins. According to the PTS  forums there is now going to be 27 cards. And a cost of 450 coins per max card.
---
So that's **250 levels** per max card, **1500 BASE levels** for six cards, and **6750 levels** for all the cards now.
---
There‚Äôs a sale on?
---
Yup there are only half a dozen builds right now the way it is
---
I like it too.  If I'm going to grind, even casually, I'd like it to be for something specific.
---
That said, I have the clean sink and my work here is pretty much done.  ;-)
---
I haven't had the game crash on PC in awhile. However I do the breach and clear event solo a lot, was doing it last night and every container was loading as being empty. Have obv had that happen on dead creatures but not on every single container on this event. I got mad, disconnected from the server and joined a new one. It loaded the new server with the event starting again even though it didnt show on the map lol. I completed it a 2nd time and got all the loot.
---
What the fuck is a zoomer
---
I‚Äôve had enough fat boys and revolvers from her I could cry! Yet I seem to keep going back for more... it must be her eyes lol
---
I just earned the stars wall paper, so you're ahead of me! :)
---
I suppose it's some sort of compromise.
---
The majority is not into playing NW for extended amounts of time, so putting up challenges that require more NW-y things might backfire - even more.
---
I always go and play the drum.  I tend to be the lowest level player there, so I let everyone else fight the ghouls, and I just keep drumming...  Unless the ghouls come up on the stage with me!  I'm not about to die for this.
---
its not filled with hackers, have only been suspicious of like 1 or 2 people recently. I have been playing a lot as well to get the rewards.
---
‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù
---
-Lord Todd
---
Generally when that happens I picture it's a troop of Super Mutants destroying Bethesda's generators. 
---
(Doesn't last long. So I am assuming they just hit space bar to repair them.)
---
Is the flying saucer cool? I kind of want it
---
Yes.   And if that does turn out to be the case, I don't see myself playing as much.   I use the game to relax quite often.   Not relaxing if every event uses 100 rounds of whatever.   Then again, maybe that will make me turn more into melee weapons.
---
So if the economy is weapons then wouldn‚Äôt adding good weapons to the economy boost the economy ?
---
I bet we're going to see threads complaining about NW dailies every day until the end of the season...
---
Absolutely!!
---
That's the crappy part about being a "service" versus being a product. They (generally) only have to license once for something like Fallout 4. Then they just pay the royalties on each sale.
---
I've never crashed
---
Remembers when I got killed by a guy with.. A Hatchet.  
---
I dragged him into the storm as defence mechanism, but he kept Speed Demoning following me.   
---
Wanted to heal up, but he was there and slaugthered me with his tree cutting device.  
---
Gave a good laugh and a great dissapointment getting killed by the lowest tier of weapon in NW while having my favored noobtube grenade launcher.
---
And we can grind for the exact piece we need, not get some random drop we need to give to some mole lady in the hopes she gives us something a little better. Kind of like, what's that game called, oh yea, every modern MMO
---
Yeah there are a few tricks like that lol, you can also merge a lot of items together by destroying the one you placed first
---
One example is if you destroy a wall and build a wire going through the space, you can repair the wall and the wire will stay and work fine
---
I also got the chimney pipes on the cooking stove outside my wall that way
---
no.. they dont ban people nearly enough in this game..
---
indeed. 
---
People even kill the queen by herself
---
For now just run away. once you have your build sorted and better gear you'll be murdering them with ease
---
Yeah I can kill one in like 2-3 shots.
---
Yeah, but it doesn't
---
You lose score???  How?
---
That's BANANAS
---
yep.  Legendary weapons are 25% off at the Rusty Pick.
---
I had to look up what everyone is talking. In all the times I've done Campfire Tales, I've never once heard the scream or seen Nia. It plays the first three parts of Layla's recordings and then Ronnie's and then the radscorpion attacks.
---
Ooo cool. Maybe I‚Äôll get a b2525 fixer
---
All containers work the same way. Some things spawn per player, but anything placed in them by a player is visible to anyone who looks in it.
---
Full unyielding ultra light trapper armour. My sneak is so high thanks to armour weight, agility 30+ and perks that I don‚Äôt feel the need for the Stealth Armour outside of nuke areas.
---
I‚Äôm so frustrated... I have no words...
---
We all know that. Lol
---
If you can nullify its primary attack I don‚Äôt see why not.  Killed many myself after I got the right skills for that.
---
Yup. And I seriously wish I could place them at my camp...
---
Yeah. Almost like real life...  shit happens.  Lol
---
I don't have an issue with it.i realise it is an online multiplayer game.this happens to ALL online multiplayer games.some more than others.i play another war robot game that this happens all the f'ing time.that one i DO get pissed.because it is highly competitive and you lose cups which knock you down the ladder and possibly out of champion league.
---
I'm about done doing public RR events. Be 10 plus people there and only 2 of use are gathering ore. People don't seem to realize that it spawns separate for everyone so if more people would be collecting ore the faster it gets done. Shits's annoying.
---
Honestly, the dude trapped in the fridge in flatwoods weirded me out the most. My subsequent characters  never even attempted that lock pick after the first time
---
The little girl drowning another in the Grafton river is super spooky and dark.
---
Shit, i can't even log in, just keeps saying servers are down
---
18 rofl
---
I‚Äôm with you on the repeatable. I‚Äôve been logging out as soon as I finish my dailies
---
Eventually you'll reach a point where you can deal with many at a time.
---
Sounds like they duped a bunch of holiday gifts, opened them, then dumped the extras.
---
Unfortunately it‚Äôs just not that feasible. You would need an endless amount to caps to buy out their vendors, which just helps them in the first place, or an inordinate amount of time spent hunting them down and trying to stop them from duping. Bethesda just needs to be more proactive in banning accounts with absurd levels of items, especially those that are from events no longer available.
---
No, there is a short cut from the start of the silo in the storage area it‚Äôs directly behind you after you‚Äôve repaired the cores, you need to open it from that area. Then if you die you have a short cut back to that area
---
could be a visual bug only. have you tried logging out and in again?
---
Best  tip I can give you OP, or anyone looking in is this -
---
Don't go hell for leather in a couple of matches. Look at the map, before you go in...realise where the fire starts and where in either map you'll find a good spot to hide safely enough...a good bush growth for example, up behind the Morgantown Frat houses is good and will give you some time, or across from the road that leads to Grafton Dam.
---
Now once crouched, hidden in the bushes(third person will allow you to circle yourself and see how hidden you are) you can enter the Pipboy and move your cards around...maybe for a good five/ten minutes.
---
Also...take notes of what you have for cards and look for advise online. Now you'll know what you need...maybe have a few good combinations and a quick two minutes in your favorite hidey-hole will see you ready to go and set you up in future.
---
Word to big bird.
---
Does it apply to modules?
---
The Legendary Run is fucking dope. I turn on my PC and boot up the game, log in, and start on my dailies while my boss rambles on during our 9AM conference call.
---
I knock those out in about an hour, conference call ends and I get to actual work for the next 7 hours. Clock out, run 5 miles, shower up, then log in and work on the weekly.
---
It's actually felt good for my mental health because of the quarantine and feeling so aimless and cabin fevered being home all the time, this gives me something to look forward to each day and to get some cool little freebies to boot.
---
the only way you havent got all of the cards available by the time youre leveled into the 80s.. is if you have been holding on to levels since you were under lvl 50..
---
all of the cards are unlocked at level 50...
---
Whenever i do that and im using speakers not headphones i wonder if someone is gonna call the cops
---
If each card gives only 1 coin--even the gold ones--this will take forever to max out even one legendary perk.   Not sure I even care about them now.
---
Explosives in NW are just op compared to adventure mode.
---
No, because now god rolls are worthless aka for caps instead of trades.
---
They haven‚Äôt even bothered to delete all the blatantly hacked weapons, and ban the people using them, let alone go after the dupers with any real effort.
---
I think that your junk in display cases can sometimes be used for crafting.
---
is that true though? I haven't heard that the rare asylum outfits have lost any value..
---
&gt;How's the thorn set coming along? Same rng as SS I guess...
---
In some ways its better, but in other rays it's worse.
---
Pro: it's a guaranteed 3 star, so if it's trash at least you get 24 scrip back.
---
Con: it takes a module and 11 vault steel to craft a piece, which is 160 scrip. This means you have to deplete the scrip machine *and* do enough dailies to earn 10 extra scrip just to roll a single piece.
---
30, been decently grinding and trying to keep up in full groups for building or event groups depending on what‚Äôs available.
---
Well the storage isn't small per se. The external is an SSD to make the games run and load better, I probably should've specified that.
---
Really depends on how you maximize your build. My most recent build is level 56 stealth-based archer. All bow-related perks maxed out, bloody mess maxed, concentrated fire maxed, covert operative maxed, and better criticals maxed. In addition, I have the Eagle Eyes mutation and my main bow has +10% damage if mutated and +50% V.A.T.S. critical damage.
---
A level 50 scorchbeast takes 2 or 3 hits for me. A legendary is maybe 6 or 7 hits. They're very easy to solo, it's just a matter of putting points into the weapons you want to use.
---
Same here
---
Agreed, if you cheat/exploit you should be punished
---
This was driving me crazy, too.  It's in the basement, in the steamer trunk, across the room from the fusion generator.
---
The quest marker would point me inside the building, then once I was inside, point me outside.  All the other google search results told me it's in the ATLAS observatory, but the ATLAS observatory has been all boarded up and you can't get in anymore, I assume since the Wastelanders patch hit, probably in preparation for the Fortifying Atlas event in the future patch.
---
Can't find solutions on those rare outfits, but they need to increase weapon levels to 55 and 60
---
Huzzah!
---
Pick three locks isnt too bad espescally if you have the NW lockpick card.
---
The revive player is the worst.
---
Your point is valid, but at least I am not hiding in a bush for 20 mins .. but being said, I hate NW myself and hate that I am being forced in NW to do a challenge. Bethesda said the scoring would be part of normal gameplay, but here we are being forced to play a game mode I don't want to play, how is that even normal to begin with, I agree, it is BS
---
The matte black paint is delicious
---
If you are on PC add me: bludybowlingpin I like making camps. We can build one based on your toon(s)' lore if you like.
---
Good advice. Newbie question....The special points are the same as adventure? Any way to change this without cocking up my finely tuned adventure mode perks?  Basically i want the aquaboy perk but I'm 1 point short.
---
I don't have a specialised build (Bloodied, Junkies, etc) at all, just a level 45 Excavator suit, a Furious Gatling Gun, and a 50cal machine gun, and I've managed two Scorchbeasts together, solo.
---
Queens, however, not so much.
---
I've never seen Graham on the roof of West-Tek.
---
Go onto fo76 if you don‚Äôt believe me there‚Äôs been a massive dupe wave and sadly I know due to one of my friends duping the stuff as well as everyone else
---
Check settings and press alt + enter to try and see if that works. Change resolution down to 1080P.
---
I don't think what you're doing was ever intended. So there's gonna be a bit of issues with how it works. PC/xbox versions are different. They're not supposed to sync. but again this feels like a very specific issue to xbox pass people playing on pc.
---
The grind is still the same now as it was when they were originally released except we cant keep track of how much exp we need. 
---
Im still trying to get the last Xmas reward now as i got all the Halloween ones last week, and no idea how far i am from the 14k required.
---
It would be good if they didn't make a complete ball up of it.
---
They do I agree with you on that one
---
Ssd reduces load times by 70%. I load into nw and can instantly move around before the timer even appears. I see other invisible players just standing still cause they're loading still.
---
I understand that now, which is why this is so frustrating. To be clear I have not been holding on to levels.
---
I am trying to post a screenshot but that option is greyed for me. (Maybe not enough posts?)
---
My advice is to get used to it, I don't think it's going anywhere soon and there are many more important problems with the game at this time.
---
ghouls? i coulda sworn it was mutants when i did it.
---
No because the value of a weapon is based off of the current meta, time needed to aquire the item, how likely you are to get those specific legendary rolls, etc.

This is a decent tank build for PA. Left 6 points to play with depending on what weapons you use and how much you want to carry. You can do the same build with no PA and just swap out the PA related perks like Stabilized. You can make up for the loss of penetration by using stealth perks but it takes some getting used to.
---
Hmmm...mine connects...just doesn't do full screen or sync character...
---
&gt;I sell plans for ultracite power armor mods on PC for reasonable prices, like 25 caps apiece usually. 
---
The ones you're selling are probably the ones every end game player has. The ones people are after are the targeting HUD and calibrated shocks, both of which have a &gt;1% chance of dropping from scorched earth.
---
Even having "just" a full set of six maxed out cards should be a long term goal, not something high level people could log in on the day of the update and reach.
---
Wow I am so fucked .. I thought I was doing ok, I guess not
---
Thanks for the offer but I‚Äôm on xbox
---
Nope. No PTS for me. I‚Äôm on PS4. I want the Bethesda experience here as well. Rushed events and funny bugs.
---
I picked one up in a vendor today along with a ton of other legacies.
---
But why would the game use bobbleheads?
---
Until all these guns magically appear you should be good
---
I finished her quest line and now she is mai waifu.
---
I think the weight reduction is only on the base weapon so increased weight for component changes are at their regular level.
---
Everybody knows that the bird is the word!!
---
Her bubble heads might have popped
---
Exactly what I‚Äôm talking about.  Reworking teams as well as adding a reason to group for events, made the game feel fresh. 
---
I‚Äôve done events that I‚Äôve never bothered jumping into because I‚Äôm a solo player as well.
---
That, I don't know.
---
Yeah, did ALT-ENTER, WINDOWS-ENTER, SHIFT -ENTER...nothing...
---
And I guess I did expect character not to sync but with it being XBOX GamePass, was hoping it would...I am Level 100 on XBOX, so don't want to start again. It did sync my BethesdaNet however.
---
What‚Äôs the T word?
---
30
---
I don't think so. You only have seven cards anyway.
---
Oh they already have look at the trading sub I found 20 be15 laser rifles in a bag at my camp
---
It's been a long time since I had to run from a scorchbeast. I kind of miss the challenge, but yeah once you get some good gear and some prime mods learned, you should be able to kill them in less than 30 seconds.
---
Trading
---
What I would love to see is a written message from the team about why decisions are made and what the goals are for some decisions. I'd feel better knowing why they made some choices that we don't agree with. At least I could get some perspective even if I continue to disagree.
---
The mods don‚Äôt like it
---
Or u could just delete everyone‚Äôs weapons inventory. That doesn‚Äôt solve it. That removes every item that anyone‚Äôs spent time grinding from the game.
---
What I meant was perks like Travel Agent.
---
To answer your question some slots have no cards at all.
---
Perception has 3 card equipped equaling 5 (the rank) one card in the row below and 6 empty slots where cards should show
---
I would spend so much money if I could buy the stuff I missed, i just started 2 months ago so i missed alot of awsome stuff
---
How do you get settlers to join you?
---
I like it too. I like that the challenges are easy enough that you can complete most of them without even checking what they are.  Doesn‚Äôt feel that grindy to me. 
---
And the public teams system is really cool, no longer swap out charisma perks all the time.
---
I haven‚Äôt fallen victim to this bug, yet.  Not looking forward to it.  But such is the way of our Beloved Bethesda.
---
There's no possible way they can prove who has duped gear.
---
Ah, cheers
---
Yes.  It's possible to kill the Scorchbeast Queen alone too, even though neither seems possible to a new player at Lv. 50, I'm sure.
---
you cant embed images on this sub.. upload it somewhere and post a link is all you can do...
---
Yup! Once you level up some more and get better gear you can kill them in seconds.
---
Same here. I went only to kill a few mobs but ended up killing 4 players and looting a lot of shit and yet only 2 mobs. Nah, fuck nw challenges, don't even care about reaching lvl 100 anyway
---
Don‚Äôt use it in your title I got a ban for 3 days last week due to that
---
I always join on Xbox
---
Yep, same it's not perfect by any stretch but they made some good moves.
---
I sympathize with your logic there.
---
As long bethesda fix this dupe very soon, the market wont take a big hit.
---
Problem is they usually takes a week to fix it.
---
Every 24hrs with a dupe active hundreds of thousands items are being duped and losing value for a long time.
---
Its sad but it wasnt the first time and wont be the last. Certain ppl play just to cheat and its not a minority. They are digital thieves and step on anything or anyone to get leverage. Thats human beings for you.
---
how about hallowen candy from monster mash does it count  as currency
---
I must return to my peeooooppuuuuulll...splat.
---
I know the pain. I'm 2000 scrip deep trying to roll that Unyielding SS chest.
---
I dont care for the other parts as much, as I already have a Unyielding set. But I can't go back to life without a jetpack.
---
You can find YouTube videos that show the locations of guaranteed spots for every bear. Should take 15 minutes tops if you would like to still attempt a whole collection
---
People seem to like buying them so I don't mind.
---
Why would that be a good idea
---
Pretty much I‚Äôm just pissed that I grinded for something that‚Äôs now worth rotten meat
---
The lobby is too quick and you should be able to load into it, then choose Morgantown or Flatwoods, not vote...but I just sacrificed matches to keep out the way and sort my cards.
---
Just take notes though. Makes all the difference. I actually ended up with really high places the few times I crouched in the dark and sorted out my wee build...üòÑ
---
Yeah.  Every time I am in there I think, why can't I just murder all of them in 37 seconds and take all the plans and take over this place?  What's stopping me?
---
What the hell was your friend thinking?
---
Did you recently play on a server where your camp couldn't be placed, and craft? That's what I did. Lost all my bears and steins. Lesson learned.
---
As for bobbleheads, your friend either went over max budget and someone was able to enter their stash or their story's a bit fishy.
---
Well if there‚Äôs a dupe might as well try it ? Idk
---
I just got it downloaded I'm getting a noregionping error
---
Like someone else said, I'm most dissapointed that they failed to mention anything about the ludicrous amount of bugs in the game.
---
Especially score completing itself. Let alone the fast travel bug which they did shit to in the last patch and adrenaline currently being completely useless. That's kinda a big deal no? I'd take that to suggest we won't get that potentially "fixed" until next month now? Oh boy.
---
Because if u move the level of weapons up it makes your entire weapons inventory useless. Nothing max level. So may as well delete it all. Same as your suggestion of raising the levels.
---
It's so casually friendly and I love it. Just boot up 76 for three hours at most and do something else afterwards. Most fun I've had in months. Helps my mental health too. Plus the community itself is just great.
---
Same here! I did a few events I avoided because my team jumped over to them. I like that it's a mix of different levels and skills.
---
He‚Äôs a moron.
---
Sorry, but thank him for destroying what little was left of the economy.
---
Just wait, BGS is going to account lock all future weapons and armor now.
---
It isn't,  he/she is making a joke.
---
Yea it sucks not being able to keep them if you unstalled, I had some cool pictures
---
Wouldn‚Äôt call em a moron just a strange person who wants to watch the world burn
---
I don't know about all this but for sure there are too many currencies in this game already.
---
The game never crashes until AFTER you spent an hour and however many resources building and defending a workshop. Never before!
---
I‚Äôve been doing the same thing recently. Might as well pop in and see what‚Äôs there. I‚Äôve gotten a few brown ones. I only run male characters and now have no real reason to wear it with the simplified challenges but they are a lot nicer than the white outfits!
---
Welcome to FO76! The short answer is no.  When you log off so does your camp
---
I reinstalled for Wastelanders. Played a bit for 3 or 4 days, and quit again. So, bursting out laughing at how pathetic it all is is my standard reaction to 99% of the posts in this sub. 
---
I appreciate those that like the game, but lol at requests for quality of life changes to a game that can't pull its head out of its ass.
---
Lacking in empathy and common sense too.
---
View public teams only as a passive buf, because there is no way you will ever find a public team that will be synchronized on any objective. These are just strangers which care about their own business and do whatever they want, not counting the frequent server hops.
---
no my dude, you have to choose.
---
bear in mind if youve read the plan it has a chance to drop... thus youre guarantee of a 3 star may outweigh the module when its only 25 scrip more...
---
Yes. And lets say bethesda drops the servers for a period or even disable vendors(that happened with display cases and vending machines), a lot of legit ppl are being punished cause those dupers.
---
So yeah dupe is a bad thing and they are directly harming ppl who play fair.
---
I'm at 26 today.. I think I'm doing ok, but I'm not doing the repeatable one that much.  I'm hoping the double SCORE week will get me close enough and I finish up with ATOMS I've earned from the rest of the event.
---
Wish they would. Sick of hearing about dupers in this game. Guess this is why servers have been so unstable again. Fuck cheaters.
---
Sure I've done this many times.  The best suggestion I have is to check out this comprehensive guide!   Should answer all of your questions.
---
The Comprehensive Creature/Animal Taming Guide
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5tamj/the_comprehensive_creatureanimal_taming_guide/
---
Thank you! I can't wait to start building :D
---
Yeah, imma just keep grinding our modules. My armour isn‚Äôt perfect yet üòÇ
---
Isn‚Äôt the game already easy enough with what we got.
---
I wish they‚Äôd police it somehow, but my only guess as to why they don‚Äôt is that if too many players get banned, it will affect whatever success metrics the execs use to show this game is doing great and everyone managing 76 should get pay bonuses and raises. But I‚Äôve always been a romantic when it comes to my cynicism.
---
Well I would be burning their hair off but a legacy is a legacy and I lost hope for the economy ages ago
---
No, Preston will alert someone should that happen.
---
Full set of solar armor I made in the last couple weeks.
---
I have seen a tameable rad toad just up the road from Sunnytop Ski Lodge. You may have to server hop a lot.
---
There are screams during the Monster Mash? Shit, I need to pay more attention next time.
---
That is true I like my display cases a lot and it‚Äôs stupid that they are turned off
---
Thank you, if someone builds in the same spot I do what's the situation there? Will I be put into a server where that area is clear of other people settlements?
---
Also, make sure you have "Animal Friend" perk at level 3.
---
Same problem. Also tried several fixes. Nothing worked.
---
I will say this, with public teams at least people are doing events now...
---
It makes Bethesda look really bad because it‚Äôs this leniency that‚Äôs ruining the game
---
Except you can use your existing weapons to find the better ones.
---
No cuz theres a giant dupe bug going around and bethesdas tryomg to fix it
---
I tried leaving the server and joining back, that didn‚Äôt help
---
Same exact issue. Pretty annoying.
---
Sad but probably true
---
and ill take yours!
---
Scrapper card?
---
Ya I feel like I've been playing for a lot of time. I'm at about 400 hours and I'm only at like 140 bc I'm not using everything in the game to up my xp counter so I don't get that kind of level required. I've only ever seen one player at 1500. I think every like 50 levels after level 50 you should get something pretty awesome considering the weapons themselves dont level past that.
---
Usually, but sometimes you will be put into a server where your spot is taken, and be given a prompt to switch servers
---
Lol yes absolutely. Actually all the other person has to do is stand and guard the front hopper, I can cover the other two from the stairs. But nope. Somehow it‚Äôs chaos.
---
When you load in you get a message saying "Your camp cannot be built here - try another world or move camp for free", then you choose.
---
Because I love my spot, I always reload.
---
It will tell you and give you thr option of looking for a bee server or playing in that server without your cablemp
---
It will give you a message saying you C.A.M.P could not be placed and the option to stay in which you will not have access to you place or to try and find another server.
---
No... Sounds like you forgot Scrapper. Still get 20 for missile launchers.
---
So, just at least let us enjoy ourselves.
---
Glad to hear of your positive experience. May your legendaries ~~always~~ never be rolling pins.
---
You can easily gather all those materials as you play though. In New Vegas, you can't really gather the ammo materials outside of vendors. I think there's a perk that lets enemies drop them too, but with only 25 perks available *with* DLC, you have to choose very carefully and I never considered the perk with it.
---
Next play session ill get the playground space ship but after that there isn't really much I'm interested in. Some of the rewards are ok but until you get to like 90 there a bit hohum.
---
So ill just be playing as usual grinding everything else  but no panic if i dont get to 100
---
Yes. If you're bloodied, you can even kill it with a boxing glove.
---
Oh that's no problem then! thank you
---
I eat SBs for breakfast.
---
I hate that shit so much then again those are most likely the same Derps complaining about the legendary run being to long to complete...
---
Next week you will be given the exciting option to skip SCORE levels with Atom.  
---
They will feign total ignorance of knowing about this bug beforehand and lying on the patch notes how they fixed it.  When it remains quite happily denying users of SCORE and of course Atom beforehand. 
---
Now they will fix it, but only if we all give them absolute hell.
---
u/juicehead You could do with looking at this.
---
Devs will now import samples to each new enemy added to the game...
---
I've got somewhere in mind, I've been waiting to play for a long time! Thank you
---
Always end up going back to the oil lamps and lanterns no matter what I start with. It‚Äôs probably my imagination but I swear they take up less budget too.
---
Are they live now?  How do I access them?
---
Account lock? Hahaha. Secret service armor and secret service power armor is tradable using a glitch. People will always find a a way to bypass anything in this game. Look at the complex player camps and the unconventional ways people have found out to make such ridiculous camps like floating ufo's. Unless they get rid of trading all together and just keep vendor bots purely to sell non legendary stuff and no  buff aid items and the scrip Machine is modified so no one can buy items from it, duping will keep rearing its head.
---
Same I haven't seen a hacker at all since the season started.
---
I have a 2* ultracite Gatling Lazer it's 2 shot and I love it for the SBQ. But using one all the time will require a lot of repairs. Seems like it degrades slot faster than my fixer that isn't a two shot.
---
I‚Äôve heard the only cure is to buy more skyrim
---
And it makes your entire stash worthless. Nah. Not the way forward I‚Äôm afraid. Only someone with limited or poor stash would want this.
---
The SS trade glitch has about a 40% fail rate...not great odds.
---
By joining the PTS, the legendary perks might be coming with P22, but atm no one is really certain.
---
aw sweet, thank you! this is awesome!
---
You're just right, I am at lv 25 and only did enough of the repeatable XP to complete the necessary level up challenges. Did everything except a couple of NW dailies.
---
As a newish player, it is necessary.  One of the most off-putting aspects of this game, especially for new players, is running into enemies wayyyyyyy higher level than you during your quests.  
---
If it was a case of ‚Äúthis public event or free roam area without any quests markers, that‚Äôs for high-level players, go there at your own risk‚Äù that would be different.  But if I‚Äôm level 10 and I have a story quest that makes me go somewhere, and I get merc‚Äôd by mobs of charred diseased lvl 46 ghouls because a high-level player stomped through 2 mins before me, it seems just unfair, it‚Äôs shitty design for a multiplayer game. 
---
Don‚Äôt like level scaling?  Want to have zones where you are indeed godlike at high levels and other zones where you are still challenged at level 300?  Then we need server lists that are scaled by character level, or make it a single player game.
---
Ah so they‚Äôre not active yet in the game
---
To get around that they could make a repeatable Wayward quest that doesn't trigger until after the Vault 79 heist is completed? (hopefully slightly more in depth than a daily) 
---
"We saw what you pulled off in that vault. We could use them kinda smarts. There might be a way we can get back into that treasure room" etc etc...
---
I feel you. I've been waiting for that fucking dome greenhouse thing. And rocket ride. Bring on Tuesday!!
---
I had this bug the first time a few days ago, 5/7 dailies were autocompleted on reset. 
---
It was also the first time I was actually logged during reset not sure it plays a role in this bug.
---
Bounce servers at the cranberry glade until you get one. Have seen them show up for me when I got my mirelurk king in that spot.
---
I stole his perfectly preserved pie.
---
I just wear my ranger outfit, no armor. If i know they are going to put up a fight, ultracite armor ready to go heavy. I use a 50 cal hunting rifle silenced.
---
Wohoo, I get the new lowscore of 13. Not too fussed.
---
Locks are not luck, they‚Äôre static, you just have to know the locations.
---
If they're really deadset on keeping the whole "scrap perk cards for perk coins" thing they could expand on it. Give other ways (that don't involve atoms) to get perk coins too. Just thinking from the standpoint of it being nice to get rid of some perk cards I don't care about ever using.
---
Yeah but op is wondering what happened to them come the events of the rest of the franchise that takes place 200 years later. The Secret Service are no where in 1-4. We wanna know why lol.
---
I tried to reply with a link generated by google photos and it was auto rejected because apparently google uses an "auto shortener" 
---
I appreciate the 76 community but sometimes the rules set by the mods can be frustrating
---
Also plenty of these duped at even 50 will still absolutely wreck and be nowhere near useless.
---
 Wish they would have a special full Atomic Shop catalog weekend or something.  Seeing that camo bundle return 3 times in one month is maddening!
---
Aid item. Perhaps you had a nice cool glass of energy weapon boy juice instead of nuka.
---
Dude, thinking of redesigning the camp. You possibly saved me alot of  budget.
---
I'm ally with Foundation so I always take photos of the foundation and sell them to the raiders for rep.Davenport tells me off unless i get a chance to lie but I still get the notes and scrip so all good.
---
Yeah, one less click and slightly higher payout. Why even bother. That's not a fix, that's barely an improvement.
---
Bloodied guass rifle?

Yeah I uninstalled. Going to give it like a week or two
---
Everyone keeps saying this is happening. I've been playing all day and I haven't come across a the fixer or handmades that everyone wants so badly. I'm not bloody or junky so I really don't need one...but to have one to try out would be pretty fun though

---
Yes!! This happened to me. But the other way round. Which is much better. Now beckett has a buddy when pouring the pints.
---
I'm at level 25 and am in the same boat as you. Real work and fallout work are a tough balance lol
---
I don‚Äôt actually understand what bloodied means
---
It was a real problem last March on PS4 when I begun the game.  But i am lucky it has not done for 1-2 months now...
---
Oh I got 10 BE15 lasers from a present on my doormat
---
This is actually a very valid point that I hope doesn't get lost in this thread.  I personally don't have the stomach for normal PVP (I also suck at it) but I don't begrudge those who enjoy it.  I might enjoy it more in FO76 if it weren't prone to so much hackery.
---
For me, although it is disheartening that 1000 S.C.O.R.E. points are tied to the weekly with dailies like "Kill 9 creatures" (in all 40ish games I've ever played I found exactly A creature, never mind 9), I'll still try (but not too hard) so I can ease up on the 100 point farming.  
---
But the fact that it technically is "extra" S.C.O.R.E. makes it more palatable if I come up short.  Thanks for this reminder.
---
I don't think anyone is saying login on the day of the update and have it, that's disengenous. 
---
There's a pretty damn big rift between "earn it the day of" and "you need an additional 1500+ levels". I'm sure there exists a happy medium somewhere in there.
---
Hahaha! I want to try that just because it sounds way over the top! Love it
---
This is why I don‚Äôt use companions at camp after I complete their quests.
---
It's a legendary prefix on weapons, where you can increase the damage done by the weapon by having low health.
---
The biggest problem is the strict schedule in wich most players have to deal with. 
---
The first few days or weeks it's bearable, but the moment You're one month in it becomes a chore and a tedious one. 
---
I think it would have been fine if you could complete the season in 7/11 weeks, this gives some time for a breather and players would still have to put in effort to get the last rewards.
---
Also, when this season ends IIRC there will be a New one shortly after, making the loop more and more tedious and will make a lot of players burnt out. 
---
I personally have experienced that in a game where schedule was semi strict but because of the small breaks in between seasons it made it really hard to keep up with it after the second seasons and people were begging the devs to slow down to a point where player numbers were going down 10% per season untill they discontinued support. 
---
If players want to catch up during the weekends (because they can't play much during the week) there should be a way for those players to still catch up. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
That depends on how much armor an weapons that person has made an out of those that are good to hold in to and how many of those are duplicates. There's plenty of people who dupped 1000s of legendary modules and just crafted to oblivion to get their God roll armor pieces.
---
Wouldnt that bug be good? I dont know what it is but wouldnt you want free score?
---
they would lose 75% of their playerbase in that ban wave lol
---
Just because the game is badly balanced or lacking fixes to your problems doesn't give you the right to dupe and cause server as well economic instability ruining the fun for others that play fair. Everyone faces those problems yet the majority doesn't decide to waste their time cheating at the expense of the others' experience. 
---
You are part of the problem whether you like it or not, what the best thing to do instead when the devs treat you unfair this many times in a row, is to stop playing altogether and find another game better worth your time.
---
Nothing speaks better to their lack of competence than the player base itself critically tanking. Just my two cents being around since launch.
---
Didn't see that before on the Reddit and this and the blog where get most the news I don't follow individual developers tweets. Thanks for the link
---
Fixer
---
It auto completed them and rewards no score. You basically just lose them.
---
I'm not making a statement, i'm asking. I saw a bunch of posts from console players regarding dupes and i thought that maybe there was some new found glitch on the console version.
---
Can we get a F in chat for this man who just said what everyone is secretly thinking and got destroyed with downvotes
---
Yes after i get my second space wallpaper i am finished i am not worry or care about the other stuff
---
Assume the position
---
Land at pioneer camp in morgantown, there are three safes.
---
Land at lighthouse in flatwoods, there is a safe, then go to homestead, there's another one.
---
What I actually like about the challenges is they act as a magnet for players. I got ganked opening one yesterday. It actually makes NW more dynamic
---
I farm them and then just pass them out to people, same with stims lol
---
Can't have all the melee str perks on my high armor melee build
---
That guide someone linked should help a lot. I recommend the three spawns north of Abbie's Bunker in the mire. Easy to run through and server hop to recheck, I've seen a bunch of tameable toads at the crashed vertibird in the pond, as well as deathclaws, sloths, yao guai, and mirelurks of all kinds.
---
This has honestly been the most jarring - and oftentimes frustrating - thing I've noticed since I started playing with Wastelanders.
---
Everyone at an event should be able to loot *all* the corpses involved in the event.  
---
If people afk, so what? Loot is instanced, so it's not like they're robbing other players of their loot.  
---
And if you actually participate and shoot at enemies, you get XP which the afk-ers miss out on. So there's still an incentive there (especially now with the current SCORE system).
---
The loot system needs changing ASAP. I'm amazed it's been like this for so long.
---
That's pretty impressive. My gauss has a 2.4k damage output when sneaking. How the fuck does a fixer do it so well?
---
Facts
---
Thank you. Please make sure to relay the correct feedback.
---
People in overwhelming numbers has an issue with grindiness of perk coin system but instead you listen to some obscure request about people not liking to scrap gold cards &amp; make the system even more grindy!
---
Same too with the perk cards. People really disliked the explosive attack cards &amp; were mixed about the armour ones but you removed the armoured ones and kept the less popular explosive attack ones!
---
I do like 3k per shot with my fixer
---
Yes on console theres a huge dupe. But it‚Äôs been ongoing on pc for ever. Easier to do.
---
I thought it was my quarantine drinking habits getting the better of me, so your post is such a relief mate! Also learned one plan and then only able to build the other. Another day another bug I suppose...
---
That's mental. Hooooow
---
I just survived longer hoping to run into more creatures. It worked out. Makes me chuckle I hid in the river. When I saw some ghouls spawn. I shot them when I crawled out just enough to use weapons. I guess you can't use weapons underwater.
---
A good build + chems
---
Switch off the jukebox and stick a radio nearby, best solution I've found anyway. The jukebox stays lit up so still looks the part
---
The junkies prefix by itself makes it a magic shotgun too
---
Ah. Yes. Chems.
---
I dont do drugs... In game.

They probably can, but the plans have been dropping from all sorts of different events, lately.
---
there's always been loads of jetpack plans
---
I sell mine for like 50 caps. Actually i lied. I have them in my vendor for 50 caps.
---
I've been playing for a while now and I'm at a level where I can tank some shots while I wave come here while in an event. I'm not going to gain or lose anything from doing that. But everyone in the event is going to gain from getting that legendary. Which means there's more legendary stuff in the world that I can buy later. My logic anyway.
---
They are extremely common because a lot of people run queens. Now,  ultracite calibrated shocks and emergency protocols,  THOSE are plans worth duping
---
So they shut down all the servers to fix a bug? That's bad timing right when they released it on gamepass, but this is bethesda I guess. Have they said when they'll be back up?
---
It hurts it really does one piece down 4 to go for me üòÇ
---
I just use overdrive. 15% damage + 15% crit damage.
---
i'm under the mindset that i will get 100% of the rewards, and i still find it fun. gets me doing different things.  well, the same things...  maybe in some different ways.
---
also got me into NW, which i hated when it was first released. it's pretty decent now.
---
Ah, well I do have a bunch of improved repair kits from SBQ fights, so that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem for a bit
---
If you think that is fun, strip off all armor, drop all weapons, drink nukashine. Get back to your camp without opening your map. Its called walk of shame.
---
Sbq only drops ultracite jet pack. Every other plan for jet pack came from Xmas gifts which were duped endlessly and probably some more now. Oh an also the mole miner pails.
---
All ultracite armor plans drop only from sbq.
---
Jet pack plans can be found in treasure map loot and bought from various vendors based on what type of armor.  Excavator (no jet pack, but other mods) from responder, t45, 51, 60 from BOS, x01 from MODUS, T65 from Regs, SS (non pa) also from regs.
---
Thats so cool! I ended up using mine as a diner, but i really love the layout you used. It all looks well put together! I hope to stumble on it!
---
My main is 56 tho I just started a new on lvl 18 or so.
---
Seams like I can't start a chat with you somethings bugy
---
Can you stop with being a contrarian troll? It is pretty obvious you disagree contextually with whatever the prevailing idea is and you do it everywhere I have seen you post in this forum + your post history based on whatever crappy reasoning you can summon in the moment. Even in this thread you've got posts complaining about the new system as well and your post here against OP who is doing you a fucking solid by investigating this fully and posting on the PTS with real evidence and the best argument you can summon is that its unreasonable expectation for people to want to be able to complete a task oriented video game in its entirety without having to spend another 1000 hours after many of us have already put that much time in. Its like really, that is what you are going with?
---
Oh I see I haven‚Äôt come across any of those yet I it wasn‚Äôt until I got the chinese armour I started to build around stealth and get the perk cards accordingly I didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing at the beginning I don‚Äôt know if can swap out some of the bad choices with cards I chose
---
If you all are crashing, then we need to look into your build of Windows, GPU drivers, a lil sfc  . . . all that jazz.   I mean be on Windows Build 2004, June 2020 GPU drivers, if you're on old Ryzen - bios updates to the newest Agesa version.  It matters a lot more than most realize.
---
I'm getting the same problem. Anyone know if there is some server issues or something? I can't find anything online.
---
Word
---
I‚Äôll be on in about 4 hours if you‚Äôre still giving away stuff: TheNotSoEpic
---
Given the trail of decisions of the last year I'm not sure if this person is still around - they might have chucked them way before launch.
---
It's a fun addition.  I'd rather fortnite style weeklies.  So 10 weeks would be week 1,2,3 etc.  Not time limit to complete other than until the season ends.
---
That way if you have taken a break or not had time.  You can then bash out a few weeks in a weekend.
---
You just don't do it.
---
That's cool. I was just pointing out that the 2 most sought after are incredibly rare. If you do find either of those don't sell yourself short. 
---
Also, I'm glad you're selling them for reasonable prices. I can't count how many camps I've been to where people are selling the common ultracite plans for 500 caps or more. You learn the base limb plans when you complete the BOS quest, and you get at least one mod plan every time you run Scorched Earth, so I have no idea why people think those things are worth much at all.
---
Well the problem is NW itself, it's very poorly balanced and optimized.
---
The majority of fallout players play the franchise for its single player aspect and co-op was a tolerable and requested thing by the community.
---
Player versus player was not liked much either and regardless they decided to dedicate a whole mode for it to keep up with the trend. 
---
Some enjoy it, but as you can see the amount of bushwookies shows how many people don't care for pvp or a battle royal.
---
Oh of course if people have the time and want to put the effort in to earn everything that's brilliant too, there are just some players who seem like they feel entitled to all of the rewards no matter what
---
Oh yeah NW is quite fun, be cool to have more maps on it too
---
I dont think the servers are offline try again
---
Multiple characters.
---
Thorn armor (for the set sneak bonus only, save that on my gear) and a set that almost has all the right rolls (still need a lifesaving prefix on one and 3 have shit 2nd stars).  I keep the stealth suite on me though for high-rad areas.
---
I figured I didn't need USSS armor for the defense.. I don't get hit much at all.
---
Mine is Max level and I get like 10 damage per bullet on the SBQ to the body. I think 16 to the head so it doesn't take long to get your damage in to get the loot at the end so then I switch back to my main and kill the mobs. I can usually do 2 or 3 sbq fights without repairs. So it's not terrible bad but I'm not using it the whole time I play either so yeah
---
I usually keep the number of each junk item below 100.
---
Scrap unnecessary junk.
---
Don‚Äôt store as much weapons, armor, or aid. 
---
Plans can stack up weight if you have tons of 0.25 weight plans.
---
You've got until lvl 50 to add points to your SPECIAL stats, after that when you lvl up you get to choose new perk cards or to move those points around. So you can change your build around as time goes on.
---
Distant Thunder drops them pretty regularly.
---
SB aren't a major issue, but as you've found out, can be bullet sponges if you can't deal a lot of damage quickly. Don't give up, yo probably haven't managed to fine tune your character's damage output yet. 
---
I run a power armor, knife build, but also rely on occasional long distance weapons to keep SB's interested in fighting. You mention melee weapons on your post, I would highly recommend trying to get your hands on a Vampire Combat knife, or Vampire Switchblade, and if either of these has 40% swing speed that's all the better. It will help keep your health up, but obviously you need the SB on the ground to do this. It can be a hard slog getting the SB positioned, but extremely satisfying once it's done. Good luck wasteland wanderer!
---
I know a spot that often has a rad road. Problem is every time he spawns first me it‚Äôs. A level 5. I go there and get my miurlurk king instead. Top right of the map. By the giant compass. Under the ‚ÄúW‚Äù
---
You‚Äôll see a bunch of rocks on the map. If you travel around that area you‚Äôll stumble upon a lake area with a crashed vertibird. It‚Äôs a random spawn point. Just server hop.
---
Can we get a clean bath and toilet to go with it though? I'm guessing they're saving those for future seasons since they don't appear to be coming up any time soon üò©
---
The going on for so long is what made it feel fake to me, but the actual quality of the scream was really good
---
glitch unlimited is another youtuber..
---
That happened to me also... I think it fixed itself. I server hoped 3 or 4 times and everytime quest marker was on different body. I still checked the bodies but nothing happened. After that I just give up... day later I checked my quests and that investigate quest was gone.
---
Also I scraped my camera when I was trying to make this quest work. Maybe this has something to do with it.
---
Seems like you're on the right track...
---
I‚Äôve been trying to figure this out for weeks
---
Tr3b is another youtuber..
---
Just another data point that shows the devs don't play their own game &amp; have no idea about what their community wants, even when we spell it out to them.
---
One of the biggest issues people had was the UI &amp; exchange rates. Nothing on those but one less click on a clunky system &amp; more ammo per click.
---
At least they raised the max ammo points to something not ridiculous. That's something.
---
It's been a while since I did that quest, so I can't remember the exact details. But is it one of those where you have to select the holotape to give, (like the quests that require you to upload something at a relay tower, for example,) rather than it just happening automatically when you interact with the protectron?
---
So when you level up did you ever actually select those perk cards that you can‚Äôt see right now?
---
Still the same issue. I've been trying for hours now.
---
MONKEY STEIN??? I've scrolled through the rewards like 10 times and haven't spotted that
---
Yeah that was really shitty of them.  Can't even defend that choice.  Sure some people know exact spawns and grind it out in x matches.  But even so you're meant to enjoy these challenges, not find ways around it.
---
Yup, lvl 240 and I still just laugh
---
Muhahaha! Yet Killin me. We need to hang
---
thats not the level up screen.. 
---
press LS from there your mind will be blown and your life changed forever
---
You don't need damage at all unless it's scorchbeast queen
---
Just hitting an enemy with anything will tag it to give you xp and loot
---
Just carry a crappy smg and run around tagging everything, heck or craft and toss Molotovs everywhere
---
There might be a reason why the gold currency fails over the decades
---
Its on the tracks above the Charleston station. If you see it please be sure to visit!
---
Also thank you! Building is probably my favorite part of the game. I love to see what I can do with the pieces they give us. I also enjoy looking at other peoples bases. You can tell who puts time into it and those who throw down a 2x2 and call it a day lol. It took me about 2 or 3 days to build and I still feel like it needs more. Im at about 75% currently but things are always changing. I tried for hours to build a half step to get on top of the train. The train is 1.5 tiles tall. I wanted to put my crops on top but you cant build on top of the train, so I made a green house lol.
---
Also fun fact, I glitched a sink into slocom joes counter to make a small kitchen area. merging things really helps to create a unique look when building.
---
I can't say for certain which ones I picked. However I do know that I picked rifleman, not sure which ones exactly. And for example I know I have travel agent but I can‚Äôt see it either. Those are just an example. Sounds funny to say but I don‚Äôt know which cards I can‚Äôt see. I hope that makes sense
---
Hadn't noticed them alongside the mounted heads etc from the Xmas gifts, have seen a lot of them again recently tbf. Is the Xmas dupe not fixed by now?
---
Also what about the Mr. Fuzzy tokens?
---
Lol well I am a disabled insomniac so I have more playing time than 99% of the world and I won't be able to play most of August so I am trying to finish it this month.
---
Bethesda could be told to orchestrate an orgy, all they have to do is one solitary job, find people wanting to enjoy said orgy.
---
They'd turn up with two monks, a nun, and a giraffe.
---
Well, fashion is light so at least I can collect that. I struggle with my collection of melee weapons. Guns take up space while I wait for them to sell but it's manageable if you know what you want and what your build needs.
---
Keep your aid out of your stash. Keep a small amount of the chems you use on you and sell the excess. Don't worry, you'll find more. 
---
Healing factor mutation saves stims and the sunkissed perk saves rad aways.
---
I use the refrigerator backpack and it saves on space because I don't need much food at one time.
---
If you are on Xbox we can join up and record the walk for youtube. I have only done it once, it was a bit painful.
---
Eh. I've never gotten the idea of "no progression" with the One Tamriel update for ESO, so I'm not really worried here (at least about the *concept*; Bethesda could totally faff up the execution). A fresh character in ESO still feels a *ton* weaker than my kitted out level 50s (particularly if I don't spend the account-level Champion Points that the new character inherits).
---
Scaling based on level never takes into account things like gear, additional abilities, and build synergies. They even say "shots to kill" is one of their metrics for scaling, which makes a huge difference. My VATS-crit rifleman can fire off a lot more shots and a lot more crits in the same time than he could in the beginning, which means he'll still be dropping more enemies and faster. 
---
And there are going to be enemies that are specifically over-tuned to be difficult regardless of scaling (deathclaws are mentioned explicitly), so areas w/a high density of "hard" enemies are still going to suck for a newbie on their own. The primary goal (beyond a rebalance across the board) is to make it so fresh characters can team w/experienced characters w/o them feeling like a total leech (a very squishy leech, no less).
---
It's really all in Bethesda's execution. It doesn't have to suck if they don't make it suck.
---
Dear god, that was beautiful. Its a little unsettling how on point this is.
---
Holotapes too.  I'm a big story fan and I don't even have time to listen to them.
---
It's a constant frustration to me too. Seems like I spend the same amount of time doing weight management as I do actually playing the game. Then I get "lucky" and get a few 1* nocturnal heavy weapons and I can't bring myself to just not pick up the script lol and I don't have the patience now to start new toons, get them to lvl 50, then somehow get someone to hold my stuff to trade between then without wanting something huge in return.
---
Part of the reason you probably dont know what half of that stuff is, is because its incredibly minor. 
---
The pleasant valley claims ticket for example is there is a cloak room attendant robot in one of the pleasant valley buildings. Some of the scorched in the surrounding area have their ticket stubs from items they've stored.
---
If you go to the robot, and have one of the ticket stubs on you, the robot gives you a few items, which is usually a set of clothes and a spoon.
---
Similarly the mr fuzzy tokens - its an amusement park, you earn tokens from playing on the games, which can be traded in for some toys. You dont earn them anywhere apart from one specific area, and they're only redeemed in the same area.
---
Idk i duped super stimpaks and now i have over a 100,000 in my stash
---
I wish I could give away the Plan: Assorted Lights with every purchase of anything else.
---

As Yoda told Luke, you must unlearn what you have learned. Fallout 4 taught us hoarding is good, and 76 is a different mindset. Unless you have specific crafting needs, you can get by with 50 or less of most junk. I routinely bulk up excess and sell to NPCs. The stuff is so common, and easily gathered if I sell too much. Smelting ore can help a lot. Beyond that, it‚Äôs a lot of prioritizing as to what I really want or need clogging the stash.
---
Not when you have respecced your main in adventure and now have to work out what cards will be the best for NW.  In 2 mins mind you.
---
but they revert the (planned) change for the converter with the One Wasteland patch!
---
Thats nuts.
---
Im on xbox and have been helping all the new players recently as i can. Add my GT and ill help with weapons and armor to make sure you have some respectable gear. GT narmyknight.

---
50x better than the default radio. I tried to power past the new dj chick they added and I just cant. Shes actually super annoying.
---
I know! I have so many good plans but I can‚Äôt sell them for any cheaper than I already has. No buyers
---
I dunno. I only joined post-Wastelanders update and it's alright. Everything is introduced gradually so it makes sense. I just wish some of it was easier to track (namely scrip and bullion)
---
Idk what you're talking about. Haven't been playing long, and I've seen glitches, but nothing game-breaking. Mainly just silly animation stuff. The worst of it was just not being able to place certain blueprints because it needed a foundation for the walls, despite already having a foundation in the blueprint.
---
My biggest problem with the game was hardly that though. It was just that all of the fun interesting new factions and characters are dead. I swear, there are times in the game where it becomes clear that even the writers are frustrated with the limitations pressed upon them. That every representative of an old faction either has to be an echo of the past in the form of a holotape, or a soulless robot. I care more about improving on this, than bugfixes right now.
---
The one you like?
---
Same I‚Äôm only on 22 and I‚Äôve done the every daily and weekly. I don‚Äôt get how people are ahead?
---
Use the ricochet perk when in PA, it has an 18% chance to reflect damage, including poison. But you‚Äôre not after the damage reflection, that doesn‚Äôt matter, when it procs you don‚Äôt take any damage.  Think of it as a substitution for serendipity that works in power armor.
---
I only has a small backpack but this does help, thank you
---
PC :(
---
Not a big surprise. Its demon Asylum and its new. 
---
edit: removed link just in case it breaks the rules. Go to youtube search demon asylum and you can be in the know.
---
Honest question, what challenges are hard to do?
---
I wish there were pantsuit or orderly versions available.  I respect that some players using male characters may want to have them wear the dress; perhaps the pantsuit/orderly option for those using female characters that don‚Äôt like dresses?
---
You don't have to reinstall the whole game after CE-34878-0, I've never had to delete my game and I've been playing since launch.
---
Go to library &gt; highlight Fallout 76 &gt; click options &gt; upload/download saved data &gt; do both upload and download for all. Play.
---
If you still get CE-3487-0 wait 24 hrs for the servers to reset, do the above and play. 
---
If you have to wait for the server to reset the problem is on their end, if you don't then the problem was on your end. 
---
The problem is usually mbs of data- takes 2 seconds to fix.
---
It's for when you buy 800 atoms iirc.   not like you buy it for 800.  Gotta bust out the real wallet.  Kinda like the elders battlecoat last year (?)
---
In that one time situation sure.
---
If it‚Äôs like ‚Äúmounted ... ‚Äú or something, I‚Äôd drop them in a train station because I hate seeing (Known) Plan: mounted ... (59) and I‚Äôm sure everyone hates seeing plans that everyone has.
---
Personally, I think that it the scale was less steep, people would have less of a problem with the system. The intent is not to give players something that everyone will max out, even right away, but something that can be reasonably worked towards as a stretch goal. If you release content that a large chunk of the player base has already completed, then it would just end up as free power creep without actually encouraging more play over time.
---
Ahh you would think so. However what doesn't seem to show in the photo is LS is greyed out. That is part of my dilemma and what is making it so very frustrating
---
I thought just Valve did that...lol
---
Well crud, that's what I was planning to spend on
---
Yes, pretty much. There's only a few points damage difference between the 35 and 45 base version of the weapon and with the furious effect it will stack damage at +5% per hit upto +50% damage.
---
No contest really.
---
It probably is unfortunately. But since you have the plan to craft it, it can be dropped from the purveyor. I kept my lvl 35 until I got a better one later on. I have a mutants Max level and I haven't used it since getting a decent fixer.
---
No, raider thugs come and strip it off you as a random occurrence. 
---
J/k you keep it
---
Jesus Christ. I guess we can't have good stuff because people will always find a way to ruin it.
---
i was walking around back when i started and heard that. walked all the way to the ash region with an eye over my shoulder
---
They don't. Fire is countered by fire proof, poison by poison resistance gear and rads? just take some rad away. But bloodied is just one example. There are broken shotguns and miniguns, tons of stacking effects and junkie's. And ofc commando build which work for the most part even without legendary effect. But that's the problem with balancing. You actually want to reward the player for a good build, yet there are all the balance nightmares in online play.
---
Oh man, knock those tadpole quests out. They suck but it's a must
---
The only two things i have found so far at the train stations are a 3* Nocturnal dathclaw gauntlet and a 1* bloodied combat rifle üòÖ
---
It's like a hackerthon weekend project.  After many months of trying to fix the creation engine. The devs probably sick of working on adventure, got drunk one Friday night and set a challenge to make a fallout battle Royale.
---
Ah okay. I have an idea where I get the subscription for a month, and I put all my junk into the scrapbox for the whole month, that way I have tons of extra stash space for other things
---
You can still use the junk so might as well grind it out for a month so you don‚Äôt need to use your stash
---
This is absolutely a false report. 
---
OP seems to have posted this as a weak threat to deter duping. 
---
Now duping is bad and wanting people to not dupe is also a great attitude. 
---
However posting a false report like this causes more harm. 
---
For every new player and even experienced player that reads this may become scared to pick up anything within the game due to being worried about a ban. 
---
This type of post even though set with the right intentions causes more damage than good and should just be deleted.
---
Absolutely, that was another really intense tape to listen to.
---
Keep your vending machines outside and obvious please :)
---
The new dupe allows anything that can sold to a vendor so if the presents can be sold to them then they can be duped. Mr fuzzy tokens were duped previously but now this new dupe just makes the tokens pointless as they were a middle man and the Mr fuzzy outfit already dramatically dropped in price from the Mr fuzzy token dupe. Now the costume could be a few 1000 caps, same goes for the faschnaut rare masks.
---
Depends on who you ask. If you're asking a new player I imagine all the dailys are tough. 
---
For everyone else the Nuclear winter challenges are frustrating and at times difficult and especially time consuming.
---
Looks awesome man
---
 This is ridiculous. The legendary perks should be a reward for grinding hundreds of levels. Instead,   it's just an introduction to a new grind. That is insult added to injury added to another insult. It is simply unacceptable.
---
As for the perks themselves, I think they are fine. In my opinion, legendary effects should give you a little bit of a bonus and that is it. I have always disliked the way legendary weapons work in this game. In my opinion they should be a nice bonus to add fun to the game. Instead they are an absolute necessity that you can't function without. I don't want legendary perks to be that way.
---
I haven‚Äôt been on in awhile too but supposedly there has been a new very popular super glitch so if you do start playing again the economy is going to be very messed up
---
The hell? I found a yellow one while looking for ballistic fiber awhile ago but just left it cause I didn't know they were worth anything
---
Try and select them on your next level up. This just seems odd
---
A mixed set of unyielding armor with shadowed/stabilized/ultralight mods, and working on an unyielding thorn suit.
---
Which is most of the time for me as a level 140 on PC.
---
Ditto. Tried their fix on their website but no luck so now I‚Äôm reinstalling hoping that does something...
---
The bugs will likely persist until long into the season.  If you want any chance of finishing it or if you want things from the seasons back end, you'll want to get on asap as it takes time unless your using xp exploits to grind up xp in possibly the tens of millions.
---
That said, I have had no major issues, so take it all with a grain of salt.
---
You can save pictures onto a flash drive for safe keeping. 
---
Plug in a flash drive &gt; system storage &gt; capture gallery &gt; Fallout 76 &gt; pretty sure it's options &gt; save to external drive. Then so far as I know you pull the flash drive, haven't found a way to safely remove it yet. 
---
So far as I know there is no way to put an image back into your gallery ingame once it's removed.
---
people are blowing it out of proportion. the vast majority of players with anything worth duping won't be selling them for caps or giving them away for free.
---
so at the end of the day, yes. more guns will enter the market and dilute it a bit. but a B2525 fixer is still a B2525 fixer regardless. the ones with the means to will just hoard them.
---
Discovered one thing as a new player. Very few things you have are wanted by other players. I have around 40 mutefruit bushes and several water purifiers. I leave my known plans for new players and simply sell my purified water and mutefruit to traders. I have the green finger perk and maxed on dealing. Every visit makes me over 200 caps. Easy money.
---
Throwing the glitched guns out of the conversation, I think the best guns are bloodied faster fire 50 cal and gauss minigun.  LMG also shreds but needs frequent reloads.
---
I still put the bffr 50 cal first for queen fights because it doesn‚Äôt have a spin up, reloads quickly, is miles ahead of the gauss minigun or LMG when crafting ammo, and lasts a long time between repairs.
---
The 50 cal can clear the mob and solo the queen, it‚Äôs relentless.
---
Same problem here. Tried everything others have suggested in various threads/forums to no luck.
---
FYI it is possible to level up a special and not select a card in that special so having less cards available isn‚Äôt unheard of
---
Make bulks of the junk you have, this does save some space
---
best is relative..
---
there is not a single heavily duped weapon I would ever use because I dont run those meta builds.. 
---
to me its all useless garbage that I would likely scrip before even attempting to use/sell it...
---
and of course the wide release is timed for the new free players.. 
---
at least anyone whos trying the game for the first time now is gonna be hip to exactly how broken from top to bottom this game can get at times..
---
this too shall pass...
---
If you want score, you're going to be losing far more by not playing than you will from bugs. For context my figures: about 31,000 score earned so far, 750 score lost to auto-completing dailies. I've been luckier than some on here in terms of bugs, but as you can see you're losing a LOT by not playing.
---
I thought her scream was hands down the single worst piece of VA in the entire game. It ruins the whole event
---
You on PC ?
---
So it's scrapping items that aren't currently displayed in display cases?
---
Most likely related to the new influx of players would be my guess if your internet is working well. Nothing you can do but ride it out. Maybe send a ticket but it'll be fixed by the time you get a reply.
---
A perk that lets you favourite your chassis.
---
Nah PS4 and I keep checking the stations and not finding anything.
---
Well they are being forced to play a game mode they don't like, to get rewards in the one they play.
---
What was the tape called
---
they are hiding and giving noncommittal answers for the next roughly month or so...
---
-ETA: well not the devs but the employees who check forums
---
I did five earlier as well. Stopped trying with the logic that if I were to spend the same amount of time in Adventure mode I would have gotten the 250 score through the repeatable xp one.
---
Ah ok
---
Ill be outta caps from travelling before I find something to buy
---
That's such a joke, what is even the point of looking for rare stuff if this is the case. I've literally never once seen a rare faschnacht mask for sale tho. How recent is this dupe?
---
I suggest not picking up any notes you find in those woods. Who knows what might pop out
---
Yup. If you use the drug you‚Äôre addicted to it will negate the negative for the time the drug is active and you‚Äôll still get the damage bonus
---
Dude the most terrifying for me is Calvin van Lowe‚Äôs, ‚ÄúBehavior reprogramming‚Äù just wait till the end and you‚Äôll get a surprise
---
At this point, how about the "team" start paying attention to their audience instead of being told through an elaborate game of telephone? But hey, just maybe, Bethesda could insert a currency into that so that we could grind as a means to be heard?
---
Wish that were a feature.
---
same problem here
---
They‚Äôre dropped the ball on obvious shit in wastelanders. This being one. SS is also completely pointless and may as well not even exist
---
Seen several posts, most likely a back end issue that will just need to be waited out. Typically when they release any new system (like two factor) it struggles for the first few days as everyone uses it.
---
Thousands of Masks?
---
You lose more by not playing. I don‚Äôt understand why you would not play if you want season rewards.
---
Not really screams but more like kids laughing only it sounds like ghost children laughing
---
Depends on the difficulty of them, yes the public teams are great but I haven't been to a project paradise yet where any of the other creatures that I wasnt defending survived
---
Throw everything you learned about standards playing other MORPGs out the door when you enter here.  Its a totally different structure over there at 76 HQ
---
I spawned at morgantown high school, the front doorway usually has a crate for a weapon and 1-3 dogs spawn outside. If there isn't anything you can crouch in a bush with your gun facing towards the floor to make a smaller profile and wait for mobs or the grafton monster to spawn.
---
You don‚Äôt need the plan for it to drop from the purveyor.
---
If your still working on this, I had one more thought; what are you using for DNS?  (if you don't know its probably your ISP and that's likely OK; If you do know and are using one you set, try using a different one and see if the issue goes away.  Cloudflare is 1.1.1.1 and google is 8.8.8.8 if you need one to try)
---
Exactly but OP never thought of that and it's called "Sunsetting" something Bungie is doing on destiny and it fucking sucks, I quit destiny when they announced that bullshit.
---
you dont "need" it per se.. but it is the bees knees of armors currently...
---
I only want a chest myself.. 
---
I run a Non-Addicted Full Health Sneaky Vats-Crit Rifleman
---
my armor is all mixed.. I care more about the legendary effects than the type...
---
It‚Äôs the norm! üòâ
---
I'm on pc. Can I buy one off of you good sir? Please.
---
yup, I FallOver 76 times a day and can't get up. I wish someone in charge of 76 had pride in this game.
---
It‚Äôs not a competition. Set your own goals for what you decide is success in the game. 
---
While I agree that duping (and therefore violating ToS) is a bad idea and shouldn‚Äôt be done, I‚Äôve never let it affect my gameplay.
---
Its on the store, its the next to or last offer
---
Full unyielding bos heavy combat work towards ss set now
---
OH DEAR!
---
That's a good spot man. I am at 29 right now and I do feel behind bc I missed a day of score sadly. The repeatable score is amazing if you stack exp food with unyeilding. I will sit in radiation rumble to farm the mobs and gain two to three levels per event.
---
PM me.
---
Not everyone is amazing, but enough are to drown out the negatives.
---
You ain't kidding, I am stunned at the lack of maintenance on this game by the devs.
---
They still don‚Äôt get it. Just make ammo sellable or scrapable what‚Äôs so hard about it lol no one wants to use a shitty terminal.
---
That‚Äôs what a lot of people do. Just be sure to set your renewal to off.  Then take a screenshot of it to be safe. Then check it again the next day.
---
Ok
---
so straight to his "treasure?"
---
Yea Fo76 is unlike any other mmorpg
---
Exactly, I pulled a weapon the other day just to burn some scrip off since I was near the cap.  And it immediately went back into the grinder.  
---
Between there being no real point to a marginal upgrade on a weapon vs. the difficulty of the content...the crafted SS weapons (if you're into those, I'm not since I'm commando build)...and the crafted SS armor.  There's very little point to the purveyor other than to supply modules and vault steel.
---
And I don't really need more modules since I have 'good enough' SS armor in all 5 slots.  Sure I can try and roll off one piece that has a Hunter prefix to something else...but it's not like you notice the difference in game.
---
The id is y the door iirc
---
That ceiling lamp with the antlers is badass! Where did you get the plan?
---
This. Bethesda may or may not fix the lost score points. But better to get some than none. 
---
And if you aren‚Äôt playing at all, then there‚Äôs no justification to ask for a points fix.
---
I for over was not ever gathering wood a 100 times
---
Try LB Or RB.   This screen filters based on category.   You are currently on perception.  You may just have one perception card.  You should have others under the different categories
---
Literally, just happened.
---
also having this issue but it works fine on xb1.
---
Today. It became public this morning before noon. Lots of legacy, God roll fixers, handmades, be plasma gatling and the like are being duped. The RWT scene is also taking a hit as people are bundling 10 of the same gun for a single price and the trading markets on reddit, discord, and Facebook are mad about it.
---
I start swearing like a sailor and hating Bethesda a little more every time this happens. Specifically in NW matches :/
---
I found that turning the FOV all the way down on console actually fixes some of that obnoxious blur and lag
---
Well, they added more grind and I stopped playing it because the grind is completely pointless and was obviously added to be a grind instead of trying to be engaging.
---
I like cosmetics, but there's only so many outfits you can wear at once and only so much you can do with your camp.
---
And grinding for more in-game equipment doesn't really make a difference once you get what I'll call 'good enough' for each slot.
---
Dude, people have been duping BiS gear all day and they havent said or done a thing about it LOL.  Think about that for a second
---
I've been playing since beta.
---
I've never had this problem before. I deleted game save data. Restarted the internet. Cleared the cache. Rebuilt the database. None of that worked.
---
I've got 3 hours left on a reinstall.
---
I had to reinstall once before, because an image got stuck in my gallery, and it wouldn't let me delete it.
---
If I wait 24 hours I'll miss all the daily score challenges, that's probably worse than having to reinstall. üòÇ
---
I thought I was the only one! It drives me nuts when I spend so much time working on my camp only to tear it down and start over because it doesn't look right. But at least it's fun.
---
Fo76 is the fast food of mmorpgs. They dont care about anyone but your money, its actually sad how they would rather do a pump and dump game and ruin their name then do a game that imo could be the last fallout that ever needs to be made
---
When is our next double exp weekend?
---
That happens and I'm done 
---
I'll have to scroll down in the currency systeam for like an hour in order to even see what's at the bottom lol
---
That was my plan too, originally. Now I don‚Äôt know if I can leave the magic box so easily... I‚Äôm a hoarder in games naturally, so I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm completely dependent on it at this point lol.
---
Sorry PS4 here. Good luck
---
Because Bethesda doesn‚Äôt understand that you can‚Äôt just keep using the same game engine from 15+ years ago for new games
---
You only get the collector badge if you find them in the world yourself
---
Thanks good luck to you too
---
More than you.
---
Yep. Thats exacly how I feel about this game... It's fun to play but it's the most broken piece of shit I have ever played in my life and devs simple don't give a fuck about thier product.
---
Really? Damn
---
Fiddle/Violins are hard to emulate by just chaining notes, they need smooth translations to sound natural.
---
521 total cards.  So can I ask why you want to know?
---
hey man if you want people to be nice to you, you have to extend the same courtesy
---
I always thought it was 5 minutes, but either way sounds like your server crashed early or something (I had a friend on mine last week and they got kicked when I switched characters)
---
As long as you fast travel away from the blast zone you don't need to wait three minutes, just give it like 30 seconds
---
Man, this is awesome. I tried countless times just to do this and failed. Kinda like the people who have to watch cooking shows like "how to boil water"
---
Thanks for the info OP
---
More like Uranium fever. Nothing like being the only one killing a repairing extractorsthen getting angry faced when I kill the legendaries.
---
Thanks! My mistake.
---
I go do Uranium Fever and idiots don‚Äôt tell me where the legendary is and kill it without me getting a hit!
---
Hey they fixed the lever action rifle reload here in fallout 76. It still hasn't been fixed yet in fallout 4. Only reason they fixed it is cause 76 is multi-player game.
---
Good question. It doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense, really. Some are more of a pain than others to get to by having to go to a nearby location first, too.
---
I‚Äôm only about to hit lvl 50, and now I find out there are legendary perk cards? Magnificent!
---
It's how it works for getting the atoms for completing collections, and I think it's how it works for the possum badge
---
It's becoming a joke. Hat's off to those loyal players who stuck around since launch, you are the ones that deserve better quality control than this shit show. I like this game, but damn does it need some fixes.
---
So you don't know.for sure?
---
"Until bugs are done", I guess your never comming back lolll
---
I managed to find a similar gatling laser with the same weight at someones vendor shop for just 500 caps. Fucking snatched that shit up quick.
---
Kk, I've had this exact problem multiple times since Seasons dropped. Literally takes seconds to fix unless you gotta wait on the server.
---
But priorities! If missing dailies is worse than losing pictures for your fast travels then do what u gotta do.
---
When you tell people from other MORPGs how we transfer stuff between characters they probably laugh their asses off
---
I had managed to get on an awesome public team and we seemed to spend much of the session at the same events with a couple other teams that also seemed great. They were the type that played the objective and co operated and all the events were going like clock work. Project Paradise started and they all showed up for it. I thought I might get a decent chance at seeing all 3 alive again and therefore a shot at the plan I want.  I gave them all a hello emote and promptly hit that shitty bug that locks you in the emote animation where you cant move or do anything and absolutely nothing fixes it short of quitting out and starting again. I called it a night after that :/
---
Brilliant!
---
Anthem did timers in their big event and it sucked if you ran out of time but they implemented various ways to get more time that incentivized doing more than just the bare minimum it had a bunch of puzzles was actually pretty fun even while being repetitive.
---
Yup.  And while you are tweaking make it so we only roll 3* with modules.  We done already did the grind to get to the point of rolling with modules so at least throw us a bone with only 3*.  As examples I allow myself two SS Armor piece rolls per day and today I got a 1* Exterminator and a 2* Exterminator.  Woo fucking hoo.
---
The train door?
---
It really made me change my play style and build which makes the game feel new and interesting. Went from a food build to a 4 UNY 1 BOL armor set and going with the bloodied/junkie meta. Having a blast. Dying a lot more but trying to get to 30-40 INT every time for the xp gainz. 10/10 would die again
---
Dang, i was just starting to enjoy it.
---
Most of duper‚Äôs use their private world, if you see someone from your friend list in their private make a visit if you think they are sketchy
---
Hell im just trying to do the wire glitch like in Fo4.
---
Recompense for the failure that is the ammo converter if you ask me
---
Already tried both of them :( but thanks for trying to help, bethesda is on this
---
&gt; Just hitting an enemy with anything will tag it to give you xp and loot
---
Not true. I often got hits on the sloth at the end of fasnacht before it got 1-shotted, and I even got hit markers and damage values pop up, but the corpse was still empty a lot of the time.
---
There's still a damage threshold requirement on normal mobs, it's just a lot lower than it is on the SBQ, and therefore I assume most players just don't notice.
---
Have you never fought a scratch beast or the queen?
---
f76 makes weird things when your desktop hz is not 144hz
---
For me timers make you rush through the area without getting to stop and look around and explore things. Why not just make a solid one color tunnel you run through since you won't be able to stop and look at anything anyway?
---
 I love to explore areas.
---
t51
---
For all intents and purposes, the cap for levels is 1000. After that point, levels begin to take TEN TIMES AS LONG EACH.
---
Level 100-999 is 15880 EXP each. Level 1000+ is 159880 each.
---
Free range with all that sweet weapon plans
---
Pretty good use of it! I am impressed!
---
I am struggling a lot with the train car, I have been waiting for it for a long time but the cement platform really throws me off. I wanna camp out in the ruins of the old world so prefabs is my bread and butter most the time, but the cement makes it stick out really badly! I was hoping I could just dump it on a railway track somewhere, preferably a bridge.
---
Check your weapons tab.
---
If you‚Äôve claimed them from the board they should be with your weapons, they‚Äôre used like a mine
---
I never doubt that. Still it is about the total amount of time played for that 81 hours. You don't necessarily need to do that within 4 days of course. But over the course of ten weeks it's totally doable. Especially when you additionally get to do the daily and weekly quests. that's all I said
---
The sad thing is, no one should be having this problem multiple times, no mater how easy it is to fix. üòï
---
 I dont even know what the update was about anyway. I've only been playing for 2 months and in level 38.
---
The rain door only goes on the train
---
It's in weapons, technically it's a mine. You roleplay 'walking up to it to light it'
---
Tell me about it. Heaps of people here 2 days ago were saying it was tomorrow and turns out it wasn't it's a day later. Way to rip off the new player!
---
You keep using that word you like anyone who puts out hypocrisy of this sub is automatically a DuPeRs.
---
*You* are actually part of the problem on this sub
---
FFS, haven't been on the trade reddit today so haven't seen it. I take it vending will be disabled soon then. Thanks for letting me know, between the shitty RNG in finding vendor bots and legacy bugs coming back each patch I'm just about done
---
I have been having the same problem, where are you located? I am in Canada
---
Made sure i found some good music for it lol
---
Another option could be a balance change and or new effects that compete for best if bloody stopped being #1 then the market would readjust. Like when they nerfed tse. But nomater what they do dupes need to stop, which it wont so why are we even talking about this
---
PSA: They weight 0.1 each. Don't claim em until you want to use those
---
You do realize that this is standard in just about ANY long running online game right?  Every few expansions or updates or whatever you get a new currency themed to said addition with the primary point of making sure people can't just stockpile a single currency and buy out every new thing as it releases.  
---
If everything that came with Wastelanders rep shops had just cost caps you'd have had people buying the shops out immediately and there would have been an immediate advantage to the people who had maxed out caps over the people who don't.
---
Why do people always seem to think that Bethesda just invented some sort of system to fuck with us?
---
And seriously with like half of your list?  complaining about Mr Fuzzy tokens, literal trash tokens and fucking experience as a "currency"?
---
It doesn't reward score. Would be fixed by now if it did...
---
All day!
---
Okay well there are def game breaking glitches if you die right as a sbq or imposter dies you cannot respawn at all you have to dash board
---
Steam didn‚Äôt link me to the package when I clicked it. I had to search it out in the steam store.
---
What? Modules are not on sale? I haven't checked yet. Crud I was saving up for nothing then.
---
Is legendary ability one perk that increases all special by 1-5, or is it 7 different perks?
---
Disclaimer: I don't play on PC, but I've seen fps issues mentioned before, do you think it could be something to do with this?

"I had exactly the same problem - fixed by setting IPresentInterval=0 and running in exclusive fullscreen. I still have freesync on!"
---
I do a Non-Addicted, Full Health, Sneaky, Vats-Crit Rifleman [LIKE THIS](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b445be&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2pp0pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1l71ao0an0ar0p00sv0sb0lk2lb0&amp;w=p80p90c52ij2i42iq2pa0lm0at0ed3i30ia0i50if2ik0&amp;m=5c8&amp;am=-13-1f-1321-1d&amp;wp=w5w5w5w5&amp;wm=1a2936-1124-17-1d)
---
I use an Instigating Hunter/Sniper Rifle for longer range sniping and I have a Furious Lever and a Furious Handmade for closer in work.. (Edit To Add my Commando version has a Fixer also)
---
my armor is a mix of types.. I care more about the Legendary Effect than the type.. 
---
Im always trying to upgrade my gear.. I start with 1* versions of the weapons/armor I want and just roll with it until I find something with better stats and or more Stars...
---
at this point all of my gear is Max Level but its not all 3* stuff...
---
Ive rolled a couple of 1* Gauss miniguns.
---
Main ones I roll are suppresors or mutants 3* with either 50% limb damage or gun bashing.
---
This game is held together with jam, twine and dissatisfaction
---
Theres one card for each special.
---
How about bethesda fix ur fken game? But nah ur right locking everything is easier so they will take that root
---
Yup but like a lot of things with the game mgmt keeps head up ass.
---
It won‚Äôt, I‚Äôve tried the help article, reinstalling, the help article again. Nothing. I‚Äôm sitting here frustrated out of my mind. Feel like I should‚Äôve just bought on steam for $20, that way if it still didn‚Äôt work, I could‚Äôve returned it. No other game on my PC has this problem, not even ESO.

Gen Z. After Millennials, it's the name they gave themselves I guess. It's the slang term like Boomer and Millennial.

You ever put your heart, soul, life into a workshop only to crash before you can even get your first harvest? 
---
My bet is yes. My bet is we all have.
---
I don‚Äôt cry. I don‚Äôt laugh. I just continue the grind, cuz that‚Äôs just the way life is. Or at least the way Bethesda has shaped my newly cynical outlook on the world. Cest les Fallout76.
---
Everytime I've drained tons of ammo and the Queen is about to die...
---
Happened during the time I first nuked the Queen too, man was I pissed off!
---
Bolton greens had mutant hounds and ghouls. Was able to get the daily in two runs.
---
How do you deal with getting spotted though?
---
Like, in situations where you're forced into toe-to-toe fighting?
---
Morgantown high was my usual spot but no luck today.  Ive had great luck at Bolton greens, good spawn rates since numerous areas around it can spawn stuff in.  The boyscout camp had one or two things when I visited.
---
If your desperate,  I've seen radscorpions around morgantown airport near the river dividing it from morgantown, and a few ghouls up the hill behind the airport on occasion.
---
Is it a rain door? I thought it was a diner door :(
---
So it‚Äôs not a normal door then...?
---
Yeah. you can't buy them. I have every single mag except 2 and my challenges are nowhere near done
---
Kinda figured but never heard tbat before. 
---
Lol zoomer

A 10 year old before the war with a not so great eyesight but a mind that believed in America. Fast forward 25 years, he‚Äôs this Buff guy who felt he should help cleanse the wastes and help reestablish the American government. The faction who had this common goal was the Enclave, so he sided with them. He holds equal reputation for the Raiders and Foundation because he‚Äôs both using them behind their back. When the time is right, he will turn his back on one or both of them.
---
I mean... I can see use for the giraffe for sure
---
While the door is just listed as "door"; I'm certain it's just meant for the train car.
---
I meant like someone drops it in a bag not buying it
---
also on pc, whats good? hah
---
The whole compound has a bunch of "Mad Max" nods in it. Several cars with spikes and stuff on it and a tanker truck covered in spikes too as well as a "throne" with pyrotechnics. I never paid attention to a lot of it too until a friend pointed it out.
---
I already have 60 or so weapons on me, a full set of decent weapon weight reduction thorn armor, and a bunch of legendaries in my stash ill probably never use. I rolled an instigating hitman's gauss shotgun, junkie's gauss minigun, and quad gauss pistol. I have no need for any of it anymore lol, I have more than I'll ever use. My only fun here at this point is trying out weird new combos
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
If you want any of those rewards you need to play and complete challenges over the next 9 weeks
---
Crap man, I was also debating on buying the game while it was on sale but kept holding off cause it was coming to game pass and now we‚Äôre here. Like you I‚Äôve never had another game do this, so frustrating. I really hope they address this other than saying to refer to their website.
---
Yes i like it too I just dislike the feeling to have to login everyday or else I miss shit. Also fuck NW dailies.
---
Tho it gave me a reason to farm exp and I love having a reason to grind.
---
You only need Super Duper and Ammo Smith equipped when crafting.
---
So lets get this straight... you saw one of the other top page threads on this exact subject... briefly skimmed it and caught a fraction of it (it's something around 1500 levels to max out SIX perks not one according to those threads)... and decided that it was necessary to start a whole new thread just to share your agreeing with the exact point those original threads had made?
---
I just went there and it was a cool location but not very scary. You could tell the sound was piped in lol.
---
I meant train, oops. Nope. It‚Äôs only for the train car prefab that came with the bundle. I was hoping it would work on all doorframes too.
---
Train car...?
---
It's all fun and games until you have to kill 9(!) creatures in NW!
---
Furious Lever + Crits.. hopefully Ive got some gun-fu or adrenaline(when its not broken) bonus stacking too..
---
concentrated fire is a must for targeting weak points in Vats..
---
sometimes you can back off a bit when possible and try to get back into caution but when stealth breaks I usually just lever/crit them in the face to death
---
Only for lead and aluminium
---
I don't know man, the charred feral ghouls randomly spawning are really annoying.
---
This would work so much better if the leveling was like previous call of duty games. Where once you reach "master prestige" (level 50 for fallout) it takes the same amount of XP to level each time after that. It's still a huge grind to reach level 1000 but it still feels like you're making progress.
---
Also, I wouldn't mind the ridiculous grind if the legendary perks were actually legendary. I'm talking overpowered. For example, reach level 250, ability to re-roll a legendary effect, reach level 500, raise the SPECIAL cap from 15 to 20, reach level 1000 learn the Aeternus (Fallout 4) mod for heavy weapons.
---
Not sure how that would affect balance but I'm already invincible and can kill pretty much anything in the game with what's already available in seconds so why not add something rewarding.
---
Yeah. I dont know what effects to go for really. Just need something to sink the gold in:P
---
Cool thanks for the info! How badly is the scoring system broken right now?
---
Hmmmm no, the most disturbing one IMO is listening to the tape with the reprogrammed robot &amp; its adventure in... mating.  Lolol
---
24 here.  Not doing any NW shit.
---
So they are wasting resources in a feature they don't want players using. Hmm
---
No more people selling them on eBay for absurd prices ha
---
I don't know why they couldn't add a new area with hard (lvl100 ish) mobs a place to be afraid of and work in teams. Something new to do. 
---
Instead we get the same 10 events over and over.
---
I mean like keeping them in the gallery for loading screens
---
What ? But isn't T-51 inferior to both ?
---
I an super glad it hasnt happened to me cuz I would FLIP
---
I too hate how every day Bethesda sends their secret police into my house and hold a gun to my head while I play NW.
---
This is literally what I went through my mind
---
I was playing about two hours before reset, completely forgot about the reset, suddenly checked, nothing extra completed over what I had done already. I got lucky I think.
---
I feel like they must have the tiniest dev team
---
They can stop this one similar to the way they stopped the last one, but even small stuff takes forever
---
I've been playing since launch, 1,615 hours in game, and this is the first time I've thought about quitting
---
Because it seems like this time everybody is saying screw it and duping to their heart's content, I can't believe the number of legacy and high end weapon trades right now
---
Because of that there will be people who've been playing for a matter of weeks who will have items worth more than my entire stockpile purely because they're willing to cheat
---
It's all very discouraging
---
also.. you should try to figure out a way to get a Maxed Blocker in use.. ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game...
---
a troubleshooters armor piece for ASSaultrons is good too..
---
the only mobs I even think twice about anymore are ASSaultrons, leveled gutsys and leveled floaters..
---
it threw me off a bit as well. Thats why I lined up a foundation as close as I could. All those stacked boxes next to the green house? Those are to hide ugly gaps. The preset foundation is wonky, really wish it wasnt there. Maybe you could find a spot to sink it into the ground?
---
Eastern US
---
They usually respond to dupes within 24hrs. So by tomorrow they will disable the vendors. Man remember when they went on holiday starting at Thanksgiving and didn't return to the office until January to fix the 3 month long dupe wave they let go rampant?
---
True! It'd be nice if we had more freedom in that area.
---
5x Unyielding?
---
Yeah been trying for the better part of a collective of like eight hours. No dice on sinking it in.
---
Same here. All I really wanted was the ammo converter (I know, it's tedious as hell, but it's still helpful) and some wallpapers, so I'm feeling pretty chill about it. And yeah, like you said, it's free and mostly for things we do anyway.
---
Based on my WoW experience, there can be a worse system - total RNG drops. Instead of the activity dropping the currency, it could drop the items directly with an extremely low change and with no player impact on which item to target... I don't defend the grind behind those currencies, but currecies are the better MMO system for rewards.
---
I also like it. Specially since I was running out of stuff to do. Plus, I loved the sheepsquatch plushy and am very excited to get there.
---
That is from nuclear winter! right now their is a bug in nw where you can get all the old holiday/event plans that were only out for a limited time. It look about 2 days to get everything except the winter jacket but if you hide in a bush and let everyone kill each other it isnt that bad. It averaged out to about 20 minutes for 500 points. You can afk it.
---
I've been bombarding Bethesda and Xbox and their support accounts on Twitter about getting an answer. And there are others who cannot get a response from anybody, either. Except for Bethesda's troubleshoot and, as you've said, nothing works. If anybody learns an actual method to making this game work on Game Pass PC then please do share it.
---
As a side note to show just how far afield Fallout 76 is compared to the world it is supposed to represent... the ammo and medical vendors would have been looted a long, long time before the game started. As a game Fallout 76 is questionable. As a Fallout game Fallout 76 is deplorable.
---
Totally agree. They should really try and get my money while i'm still interested in the game and love camp building. Once i get bored, that'll be it, i'll move on. Then they'll have missed out on all the money i would have spent on camp items.
---
for full health.. vanguards, a chameleon piece, a trouble shooters piece, an auto stim piece.. something with harder to detect is good also..
---
lots of ways you could go
---
Can you build multiple train cars or just one per camp
---
Yeah for $80 üíÄ
---
I wasn't complaining about Mr fuzzy tokens, I just listed them. My argument is not with the new currencies it's with the existing ones being forgotten entirely rather than expanded upon. Take the new AR skin for the handmade in the atomic shop which could have easily been created as a new weapon for one of the existing currencies

We could've waited them out too. They would've starved to death soon.
---
I had an event earlier today that wouldn't let me respawn at it, the respawn option would pop up but it wouldn't let me do it and instead come up with a fast travel prompt, instead I had to fast travel to a close marker and walk back over to it.
---
NW needs it own challenges with NW specific/locked content. Trying to force/encourage/bribe people to play a mode they obviously don't want to play is bad. Plain bad.
---
PM me
---
I like it that it gives more more "structure" in what I do when I log on. At least for now. I cannot guarantee I will participate in every following season if they don't expand the methods of SCORE aquisition or lower the SCORE requirements.
---
Is it the 500 (+200 free) or is it an actual 800 + 300 free package? Not showing for me :(
---
The challenges are for the most part designed to be things that you could otherwise accomplish while just playing the game no matter what style of player you are, whether you're good at killing other players or good at avoiding other players anyone can kill some creatures, survive for a set period or open up a safe.
---
What would you want them to do to encourage your version of "participation"?  Challenges that require killing x number of other players?  Well then that would alienate everyone that doesn't play by your style and then all the bush wookies would be here rightfully complaining  that they have little to no chance of finishing the days challenge.
---
poor guy, wish we could at least give him a proper burial
---
I‚Äôve seen some for ¬£200,so like $270 or whatever the exchange rate is. Crazy ,shocking prices.  they can at least be obtained now without having to pull down your pants first lol
---
I haven‚Äôt had any issues. Some people apparently have had challenges auto complete when they roll over. I don‚Äôt play in the middle of the day so haven‚Äôt had any problems.
---
Dense armor mods makes their ranged attacks like a small smack
---
It happens! Someday perk loadouts will fix it. Someday...
---
Mary Tinleys recording
---
Why the fuck are they over thinking this so much? The ESO system is great, works, is easy to understand, would work with this game easily, and it's fun. FFS they're even doing a One Appalachia, which is a straight rip from One Tamriel, so they're obviously not afraid of copying that game.
---
A champion or "legendary" leveling system would also help people make strong viable classes rather than every other person being a bloodied build. There's so many fun things they could do, it pisses me off...
---
All my gear is junkies so will have to be something like that :P Can you sneak well without csa or unyielding?
---
The set of cultist torches from the atom shop barely have any light coming off of them at all, even the candles are multiple times brighter.  If they didn't look nice enough on their own I would have gone for a refund.
---
Yes please
---
I‚Äôve been trying for ages to find explosive energy weapons, so I‚Äôve been scouring player vendors in hope... maybe one day.
---
No, they shouldn't take 1500 levels. Nothing should.
---
It's insane how people think it's okay for a game to demand that much of a commitment for something that's supposed to reward long time players instead...
---
i sneak just fine.. I only use CSA for nuke zones
---
I picked a red dress in fort defiant today also,hasn‚Äôt at all bothered me if the price is up or down. I will just sit on it ,weighs nothing so no problem. Maybe one day someone might want to trade for it
---
I get a crash every day. I love the I just spent a whole heap of time building  at a work shop crash. It‚Äôs def my fave
---
it has been yes.
---
It's broken. i was able to fast travel a few times after the update then it changed
---
You make a amazing point
---
You monster someone kept stealing my plasma ammo
---
I got a BE Pump shotgun with +1 agility on my first roll, not the best but its not a ghoul slayers gamma gun either so I'm happy
---
Not really. Absolute load of crap on 2 characters worth of pulls. Only thing of any note at all was a bloodied bash damage Gatling laser and even that is meh. Rest were literal trash. 
---
Freaking ghoul slayer Fatman (twice!) and suppressors sub machine gun etc.
---
Most duper‚Äôs will give you some legacies if you help them dupe
---
Sorry about these answers haha. Ultracite PA Is better against ballistic damage while x01 is better against energy damage and radiation resistance. The difference is minor but it‚Äôs there. I use x01 personally since radiation resistance is important to me. Don‚Äôt use Ultracite, x01 looks so nice haha.
---
interesting. That COULD count.
---
I had couple good pulls from the vendors today
---
its that there arent daily atom challenge rewards anymore. the 50 per week plus the 150 or so per week an average player earns...(now in the leg run)approximately half of one pipboy skin per week seems better than this block style.
---
Yes sirüëçüèª
---
There's one of these in a mutant camp south west on the map that glows a nice bright orange. Looks so much better than this horrible white light.
---
same issue :(
---
Probably a good 85% of PS4 players ha
---
My advice is to find a legendary rifle, don't bother crafting a level 50.  Check player vendors or just google a good route to farm legends.  And definitely definitely definitely prioritize damage/combat based perks over everything else.
---
No, im very happy about it.
---
There‚Äôs something more to it then just the reset. I wasn‚Äôt home and the game wasn‚Äôt running at all. So that couldn‚Äôt have been the issue to trigger it.
---
My level 462 friend called my XO1 a piece of scrap metal
---
It's the dupers dubbing massive amounts of items it strains the server
---
Fucked up if true
---
so, you go outside of the ring and find many creatures?
---
X-01 I think!
---
This really sums up the game play loop we've had since day 1
---
Just thinking about the bloodied builds sneaking because of their high specials. But good to know we others can do it too!
---
Both are about the same not much of a difference really unless your looking for specific resistance boosts t-65 beats them both out but it takes a month straight of go farming to get just the armor pieces
---
Okay.. Thank you. It's just kind of annoying trying to do the weekly Claim a Workshop score, since I don't remember all of the workshops.
---
Yeah, this is a weird problem right now. I want to say it happened to me after claiming a workshop that had been abandoned by another player, but I haven't done enough testing. It seems to offer you a new fast travel point that instead of looking like a workshop is a regular FT icon, but not only do you have to pay to use it, it doesn't even take you to your designated welcome mat.
---
fuckall
---
If you're playing on a public team, you an actually join back directly to the server you were on if you're fast enough
---
It sucks but it happens. Give them some grace. Fallout 76 is a behemoth of a game, they're using software templates that are notorious for their glitches, and people are constantly trying to glitch it on purpose for various reasons.
---
On top of that they need to keep bringing us new content to keep us playing- and everytime something new drops the servers buckles.
---
He‚Äôs an idiot sorry to say. T65 is superior to both armors which is what I‚Äôm saving up for. X01 is better though all around apart from the ballistic damage.
---
People need to realize grind doesnt make a game good. Just tedious and annoying
---
This might sound wild, but I got in touch with a bethesda support person for constant disconnects on PS4.  He gave me two ports to forward on my router and my issues have vanished.  I dont remember what they were, but I can dig into the settings if anyone wants.
---
The big lesson, lock your ammo machines.
---
What do you think will be the main focus of fixing first,Duplication or an out right annoying and devastating issue that literally stops game play?
---
You understood incorrectly.  Private servers are not reserved for 1st members.  You get whatever world is uninhabited when you log in.  That's why you'll find empty containers, dead creatures, unharvestable plants.  And when you log off, that world goes back into rotation with the rest of the worlds on the server.  Private servers are not dedicated.  And not always private, as other can, albeit rarely, load into your world (unless they fix this).
---
It‚Äôs apart of the final reward bundle.
---
MMO launch days on any expansions has desensitized me to constant crashes.
---
I locked picked it
---
Wish I could find a generous one, never have any luck. üòÜ
---
Being from the UK I always see it with the u, but I‚Äôm not averse to the lack of it. 
---
Aluminium however.... I will fight you. I will fight you with pistols or swords or French baguettes. Just not at dawn, because who‚Äôs together by then. Midday maybe 2pm so I can‚Äôt still taste the toothpaste at least.
---
same here no luck. :(
---
Have you got any rare masks (duplicates) you would be willing to sell?
---
ahahahahah you must be new
---
why do you wish harm upon others? not very christian of you.
---
No rare ones sorry, just a bunch of extras of the common ones.
---
Apparently bans just started. Seems to be you had to do high volume though.
---
No worries :) Thanks.
---
Not even just the crashes, haven't had one in awhile, but finishing a SBQ event only to walk up and see her inventory empty makes me wonder why I still play.
---
...... I have no words. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÜ
---
basically lol played after launch for 2 months and just came back
---
it will be painful brother but it is for the greater good
---
I vehemently hate NW now.
---
On ps4 they‚Äôre in your saved screenshots area Regardless if the game has them.
---
With 76's luck they will buff bloodied and add a new variant of assassins.
---
Because I was playing the game, not waiting around to engage you in debate.
---
I don‚Äôt get why you are being so overly aggressive about it but if you must know for me personally the only challenges I don‚Äôt want to do are the NW ones. I‚Äôm fine with everything else.
---
I don't see how.
---
Forgive me
---
Even the Watoga High School principal
---
I built my camp there and I loved it hahahah
---
Pretty sure everyone would prefer ‚Äúkill one player‚Äù to killing 9 creatures.
---
Don't hold your breath, sport.
---
because this is dupe #21 and it just doesnt matter anymore
---
Do you have 3 or 4?
---
Not even close dude. Dumb comment
---
whatever gets legacies out of pvp, i‚Äôm down for
---
also i didn‚Äôt downvote you but thx for downvoting me
---
For me it was, but I have played a lot. Over 2400 hours now. So the convenience is worth the cash. If you only play a little, or are still getting into the game I'd recommend buying one month and seeing how you like it. Investing for a whole year is a large commitment.
---
You can still use the level 50 weapons. Literally isn't an issue.
---
Have you checked their webpage? It's updated weekly.  And patch notes are posted after they are released.
---
Source?
---
hope for the best, expect nothing. the only mantra i go by
---
Who cares? The weapons are useless since they're duped now.
---
No, my idea is logical
---
I think it's to help stop people from just fast travelling to every workshop on the map and claiming them to help make if fairer for other players, not that you can't just fast travel to a nearby location and run there anyways.
---
In my best Ron Perlman: Duping. Duping never changes
---
Better yet, provide two paths to gain SCORE.  eg:
---
* Level up 1 time, OR gain 1 Overseer level.
---
* Kill 15 super mutants in adventure mode, OR kill 8 creatures in NW.
---
etc...
---
you'd be making a lot of people mad just to appease a minuscule subset of the playerbase.
---
not to mention there are better ways to fix pvp other than Fing a ton of people over.
---
Why does it demotivate you if someone else has a rare weapon? In reality it doesn't effect you. I am 100% against duping but being demotivated because some people choose to buy rare weapons instead of earning it is dumb. This would happen whether items were duped or not, trading is a part of the game.
---
How are they useless lol. They‚Äôre the best weapons in the game.
---
Dulping
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a few months now, I‚Äôm level 75 and my friend is telling me to get fallout 1st I might get it for a month and maybe save up a little bit and get it for a year
---
The only time it happened to me i was actively looking at the quests while they populated. Others have said going into NW or atom shop or legendary run can also trigger it.
---
I feel the same way! It‚Äôs great for people who aren‚Äôt constantly playing or have other things to help distract from the monotony of it all
---
hahahaha no
---
Fingers crossed they drop the price substantially as it was way more popular than they expected.
---
They're duped. Time to move levels up to add real value back to weapons.
---
Not sure if this will work. 
---
[ban pics ](https://imgur.com/gallery/2hF94SI)
---
Ankama and EA are worse Devs.  Also everything Nexon publishes winds up as a massive cash grab, worse than the Atom Shop here.
---
That said, they really do seem to be more focused on adding more stuff, than fixing existing bugs.  And some how each patch manages to reintroduce old bugs that were previously fixed.  They also don't seem to give a damn about dupers or hackers, as long as they don't crash the server in the process of duping/hacking.
---
I dont think three consoles would work anyways.. as soon as you turned on the second the account from the first would be logged out. Right?
---
Lora Cain is the voice behind the screams 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lora_Cain
---
Agree.  Props to the voice actress for the screams being similar to a horror movie.
---
Give me one good reason why not
---
Yep I don't give a fuck about this sale only about the modules
---
270+ hours in, I still get a small rage burst but im mostly desensitized
---
I just started a month ago and have had a few disconnects. Annoying, but not nearly as bad as the bugs in 15-year old *World of Warcraft*
---
Glad to off helped
---
Doing events is probably the easiest way. Have them join and stay on the sidelines while you complete the events. That might work.
---
I don‚Äôt know any, and have no idea how it even works.
---
I‚Äôm glad it helps
---
I'm guessing Exploding Bullets just does Area-of-Effect while Ignore Armor is...  well, anti-armor.
---
One can only hope, I swear if I buy it and a day later it drops 50% I would be pretty disappointed
---
Also be aware when you get a card pack it can give duplicates. So if you have master heavy Gunners at level 3 it can still give you a pointless master heavy gunners card
---
I feel the AMMO CRAPPER is an inside joke and insult to the loyalty of the player base and here is why:
---
I did a spreadsheet on junk items used to craft .308 ammo in relation to the junk items that were used to produce the ammo you scraped for conversion.
---
I used the base numbers, so no ammo smith or super duper.
---
Junk items used to produce 2028 rounds of .308 = 4225 junk items [lead, steel, gunpowder, etc}
---
You scrapped 10128 rounds of ammo to get 2028 in return. By cartridge count you lost just under 80%. That's bullshit.. LOL .. but hey .308 is expensive to craft right?
---
Not so much, using the junk items to craft the 10128 rounds of assorted ammo you converted consumed 11,125 junk items. The loss suffered was lower but still at just over 62%. Really Bethesda? We should only experience a 5 percent loss .. MAX.. Ammo is very recyclable.
---
When you redesign this ammo crapper, make it good. We looted this ammo don't steal it, it cost you nothing. Maybe steal a little more if we can just scrap the 15,000 rounds I got of 5mm in 4 steps but in one day, at a cost of 10% of the cost of crafting it.
---
Crikey Bethesda, don't be so evil.
---
So?
---
I‚Äôve had the same error code before (not like I was duping) and I retried and got right in.
---
Checked their web page and official forums and no further information is given on hacked weapons, bugs, or glitches that are currently in game or any plan other than tweeking the Ammo converter. Please reference any mention of hacked weapons, i'd appreciate it.
---
Lol. You‚Äôre talking nonsense. Everyone who‚Äôs worked hard for weapons over the past 15 months would have all their value wiped out. Every single legacy would be less than max level. Right now the dupe has just brought legacy and b2525 fixers down in price instead of 15+ god tier weapons. Nothing else has dropped. As far as I‚Äôm aware. I don‚Äôt see god tier heavys or sent/ap armour or even a huge amount of red asylum or fireman‚Äôs out there. To wipe the value of every single weapon in the game would be ludicrous
---
A ton of dogs spawn by Morgantown high school. I got the challenge in a few games just by spawning there, killing them, and leaving.
---
Yur father wood be prud.
---
Literally 2 shots shouldnt be possible then outside of him using a hack.  However, sustained fire on the head will drop someone in less than a second with an automatic if you have the perks and the rounds all land.  Even body shots can be almost just as fast if you're using a good weapons like a handmade or submachinegun and you land all the shots on center mass.
---
They also need to alter the price for bundles if you already own some items that are included.
---
Have passed on bundles because of this O_o
---
The items on the shop do tend to rotate or be seasonal - they remove them from the shop sometimes to incentivize buying them and put them up later.
---
I have them on my display but no copies unfortunately
---
I gave up trying to get a volunteer and started doing heart of the swamp and encryptid events when I see other people doing them. Revived someone at the swamp the second time I went through it and finally crossed that off the list.
---
I don‚Äôt really have a theme in mind
---
Oh it's worth it if you grind a lot.  The Survival Tent is quite useful when trying to scrap &amp; go when a workbench is far from your vicinity.  And well, Scrapbox is a godsend.
---
Lol!!!!
---
The only player kills I've gotten in months were afk people standing where they spawned.  I'll take nine creatures any day of the week.
---
I got a mutants missle launcher. ü§£
---
Have you tried to contact Bethesda directly to get your answers and voice your concerns?
---
lol no. they learned their lesson from the old dupe banwave and TSE nerf. tons of people leave and you ban half the playerbase your game fails lol.
---
they had to do an UNbanwave, fuckin clowshoes lmao.
---
Armor or Armour, it don't matter.  It protects you.
---
That's bullshit
---
If this is in regards to NW I will play devils advocate and say that nobody bought this game because they thought it was going to be a BR so its understandable people dont want to play a game mode traditionally un-fallout. lol
---
I checked the atom shop before loading into the world.  Who knows. Maybe I‚Äôll load in now and then check the atom shop. Dumb that I even have to do it in a special order.
---
Resident Evil 76
---
I love the tent so much.  Have 3 free teleport points is amazing.  (Vault 76, your camp, your tent).
---
Getting tired of the NW quests like kill a bunch of creatures, and getting killed.. I am like Stop killing me I
---
 just want the Challenge!
---
Must have been a different error code. Check the Bethesda response here https://devtrackers.gg/fallout/p/958601ed-login-failed-this-account-is-not-authorized-error-4-8-2000-please-help
---
Edit: not saying it‚Äôs legit news just a few people I know are saying it is taking place.
---
Then you shouldn‚Äôt be playing NW.
---
I never really understood why a jukebox plays classical in the first place. Who associates Jukeboxes with classical music? Theyre almost always full of popular tunes of some sort since theyre a device to liven up mood in establishments
---
i'm pretty sure they have to be world spawns for it to count
---
It is more than fixers. No legacy or god rolls have value
---
I play nuclear winter a decent amount. Usually a few matches a day. I don't pick up guns. I sneak around as I watch Fresh Prince of Bel-Air until the top 10 then I try to creep up and take a picture with as many enemy combatants as possible before they notice and kill me. 
---
I know I am weird. I am not however the only regular player I have seen who plays this way. I would much prefer to kill 9 creatures than 1 player. I can punch a creature to death as part of my normal play style. I can't kill a player.
---
Mu/FFR/15VCF is as good as it got for me lol.
---
Evidently
---
Scared to grind for slightly better gear? Gear is already fine as is?
---
Oof, lucky. Each time I have done that most people just release before I can revive them.
---
With bethesda that's the best attitude to have.
---
I have one. Can't remember if I got it or bought it.
---
Can I ask why people are supposed to be mad?
---
it would do fuckall. people would just use the gear they had already. 
---
make everyone grind for new gear because of a minority of dupers? no fuck that. great way to make people quit the game.
---
I‚Äôve suggested in the past, let everyone have their BE Bullshit for PVE, just make the weapons do zero damage in pvp. Idk what the right answer is but leaving the state of player vs player interactions the way they are right now is not it.
---
Honestly, I'd consider it worth it for the atoms alone, but you also get a free second fast travel point (in addition to your CAMP) that you can place anywhere you can put a CAMP, and infinite junk storage. So definitely.
---
Also, you can farm rarer/more important materials like lead, screws, ballistic fiber, etc infinitely on private servers. Every 180 or so items you pick up refreshes the spawn of what you had just picked up, so if you go in a cycle and pick up all the junk along the way (and then store it all in your scrapbox, which has infinite room) you can build up quite the hoard.
---
I haven't seen or hear (in the game) of duping but I have seen a couple videos on You Tube of people doing it.
---
I'm doing the same as you, legendary &amp; SCORE runs so I don't go to player vendors often?
---
It doesn't phase me people are duping items.
---
It's taken me 400 levels to get the bloodied DCG, that I've always wanted but I don't even use it because I have had a bloodied PF since level 80.
---
I have a feeling reviving someone in the rain works for this. When it popped for me my friend wasnt in water but I think it may have been raining. I remember being surprised it popped though.
---
Have an upvote. Made me laugh.
---
the dupe literally has nothing to do with making servers unstable. bethesdas servers are garbage everyday, dupe or not.
---
Will do. üôÑ
---
I can die in water for you
---
So obviously the only reason you‚Äôre there is for rewards and you wouldn‚Äôt even step foot in NW if you couldn‚Äôt bush camp. The whole point of this thread is that there is too much incentive to play like this currently and it‚Äôs making NW boring.
---
Watch this.
---
https://youtu.be/byE4qyx8kwA
---
To those that say those that dupe aren't selling them are wrong.  I already see people selling them.  The dupe of the weapons do affect players that don't dupe. More people get broken weapons,  which will result in more people killing sbq in secs... and those that didn't dupe or have these weapons don't have a chance of getting drops.
---
Thank you for this trick. I was frustrated when I could not get it to work a few days ago.
---
My bad. Theres a total of 3 backpacks in legendary run but the lvl 100 one is a lazy reskin of a lower level reward.
---
got a B/E/50 handmade from the WS vendor so I'll count that as a win in my books
---
I use excavator armor cuz I like to hold stuff
---
It's weird. For some reason, you can't snap the vendors together on foundation, even if you blueprint it, yet it lets you snap them together on ground.
---
Is this still going on?
---
The game is about grinding. Your gear is worthless because of dupes.
---
I'd argue a simple hackjob fix would be easy enough, but Austin's record so far proves that even simple fixes are herculean tasks for them.
---
bottom line is that, that's a big investment for a mechanic that's essentially dead and that the majority of the playerbase despises, to the point they'd be glad to see it gone altogether.
---
AA is always a good prefix.  I have kept three Gauss shotguns.  Quad, ffr which I use for Riding Shotgun and general purpose, a one star Ghoul Slayers (for running WS nuke zone) and Instigating, 50 limb,15fast reload which I use on silo runs, one shots all Assaultrons
---
I agree 100%. I've redone this event many times to collect Treasury Notes &amp; I could never get comfortable with her screams. I would leave my music on to try to drown out the screams or not be too close to the speakers. Poor Layla.
---
I have found Missile Launchers to be a good weapon to use from the tower at Ft Defiance.
---
Played a ton of WoW also, and remember some of the rep grinds.  I dare say most MMOs also obsolete your gear when the new faction/currency/widget comes in.
---
The problem for FO76 is that, other than for completion's sake, you're not really missing a whole lot if you're running around in scout armor vs. SS armor (for example).  There's not a real point to upgrading the gear.
---
AA and 2Shot are primary Legendary Effects... Explosive is a secondary, so you can have 2Shot Explosive Weapons.
---
I like knowing someone can‚Äôt just fast travel to a workshop. Gives me a chance to see them coming. Of course they can fast travel to defend events or stay crouched, but it‚Äôs something...
---
Well I‚Äôll be damned. Thank you
---
It‚Äôs always been free
---
How is your internet? Are you hardwired?
---
Oh? I always thought explosive weapons were bad. But I guess it would be useful on scorchbeasts. :)
---
a huge dupe is going around where you can dup anything as many Times as you want... so may b 25 25 fixers and legacies going around. Even JE plasmas are everywhere now
---
No I started playing for the survivor rewards but I genuinely enjoy my little hide and seek game and it earns me adventure xp while paying less attention than adventure requires. I have earned all the rewards I care about and I still play daily.
---
I like to build different camp designs and just having 500/800 of my stash just junk is not the best, I also like to collect legendary weapons so having 20 weapons and 300 space doesn‚Äôt fit well
---
I guess you can either be lucky or unlucky when it comes the crashing. I've played around 160hrs on PC and I have only experiences a handful of crashes mainly occuring in nuked zones for some reason.
---
Aye. It's included. It's an update not expansion.
---
Oh I see. It‚Äôs just a shortcut if you die. Now that you mention it, I know exactly which door you‚Äôre talking about. I always wondered how to get in there.
---
I have a feeling it'll be digital only on the store. Probably wont even have any upgrades apart from resolution and frame rate.
---
Looks nice though. Wonder if they'd use that new Wastelanders graphics instead though?
---
I might just download it now then, thanks!
---
Where do you see a backpack at level 100?
---
[I only see the Jetpack. ](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons)
---
I finished an event yesterday, got all the rewards for completing it, server lost connection, reconnected me at the same place and started the exact same event again. Double the rewards, double the XP, double the fun(?).
---
Stop while you have your sanity.
---
You can't miss any
---
And i like to wander the wasteland in my asylum outfit and responders backpack helping out low levels.
---
I am of the construction type, in fact today I met someone who asked me for help to make his house, I told him that in exchange for nothing, but he rewarded me with several Legendary weapons
---
Same.
---
It feels a bit like this is like trying to organize something with a drug dealer, lol.
---
Well, that's already been addressed. So now you are just being obnoxious or whatever. I'm not being overly aggressive.
---
Like I said. The system was designed to be able to complete without having to do NW. So to me, it seems like you are just upset because the people who like NW might finish before you. You are being selfish if that's the case. 
---
There's no real issue here other than your attitude and Bethesda can't fix that bug.
---
I spend my time doing dailys and gathering crafting materials
---
Don't download it it doesn't work. Everyone getting a no region ping error and they can't fix it.
---
That‚Äôs odd. No idea. I‚Äôm going to be playing soon. I rarely get disconnected. Influx of players shouldn‚Äôt affect it.
---
Yeah exactly! I had them snapped together on floor tiles (not foundations) originally but when i did the shuffling i can‚Äôt snap them at all. I took them outside and they‚Äôll snap just fine on the uneven terrain. I deleted EVERYTHING (ceiling, walls, conduits, all of it) within a tile of where i had them and still no luck.
---
I say to myself sometimes it's like the game doesn't want me to play it. The crashing, the bugs, sometimes just the bad luck. 
---
I keep coming back though so really which one of us is more broken?
---
AA50RW and the TS25P are your best bet.
---
Huge investment in a game with a proven track record of things randomly breaking then not getting fixed. I dont think they thought their cunning plan through.
---
Oh wow. So is there just 1 backpack and 2 jet packs in the whole thing?
---
You'll be my huckleberry? Aww sweet, XB same as this for name. Add me whenever.
---
I started late and am still grinding rep from neighbourly to ally with both factions. It's such an annoying grind because i can only get such a tiny amount of rep per day. Just seems far too restrictive.
---
I sell 1 star legendaries for 10 caps, 2 star 25 caps 3 star for 50, if I don't want them.
---
I do legendary runs, when I play, so if there's a certain legendary you want I'm certain I can get it..... eventually lol.
---
PC.
---
I think the screaming goes on for a bit long, it almost feels goofy.  And it‚Äôs just the screaming, no other sound effects.  Don‚Äôt like it but it‚Äôs just my opinion tho
---
I'd spend more money if I could wear clothes over my Chinese Stealth Armor.  So many awesome outfits in the shop and I'm not buying a single one if I can't use them.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre exactly the person I made this thread for. We need less people like you not more. You‚Äôre just there because NW rewards being afk.
---
It is unnerving to consider how long it actually takes for people to die or even lose ability to scream during wild animal attacks. I‚Äôve had to review footage of a couple bear attacks (one black, one grizzly), an alligator, and a bull shark attack and compare to domestic dogs. First, the numbers of recordings from security systems, phone calls, and bystanders are mind numbing. Second, as much as I prefer the idea of my body going to nature or whathaveyou, I really hope to never get mauled. Had some real close encounters with bears and mountain lions - even the little skittish guys like coyotes and bobcats deserve some caution - but am glad I‚Äôve always managed to be the one scaring them off.
---
Bingo.
---
You've got nothing to lose by downloading. Just give it a good chance. Don't give it like 30 mins and be all 'SUCKS LOL' As many people did when the game came out. BOOO!
---
You just need 1 piece of 15% block reduction armor and all your shotguns will do magic damage in vats without perks.
---
I don‚Äôt understand what you mean by the airport changed. Are you stuck on a mission objective or what?
---
Two secs. just swapping stuff to an alt
---
GT is also same as this
---
No. There are two backpacks. The ghillie backpack and the jangles backpack.
---
Thx for the input I swapped over to stealth rifleman and I am not feeling it so I am going back to my strength build. Ultimately want a bloodied version but want to make sure not to scrap anything good along the way.
---
Oh? That's just great.
---
Fk you. I got 2 legacies legit. By that I mean I owned them before they became legacy. An explosive dragon and an explosive harpoon gun. I don't need to lose them because some cry baby is offended that someone has a bloodied explosive gatling laser and he doesn't.
---
I wish we still got atoms for doing the challenges though....
---
Same,  plenty of other problems but crashing has never been one of them.
---
There was a story?
---
Thx it‚Äôs what I thought but wanted to be sure, wanted the best option for SBQ runs for max damage.
---
Unyielding or PA helps a lot, maximize my storage.
---
Oh and, deathclaw steak +6 STR.
---
The only legendaries I keep are unyielding &amp; bloodied.
---
Everything else, I sell for cheap because I just don't have the space.
---
I just got myself a ffr and fr 50 cal tonight, think its called the final word
---
No it‚Äôs 7 15 year olds in the parties losing their shit because they have 12 be Gatling plasmas
---
Nah it's just the playset you see around
---
Maybe, I dunno, the holotape even says that it needs to be used on the certain protectron, so I'm not sure
---
Auto laser pistols are pretty hype tho
---
These cards are to give high level players something to work toward. If people are able to unlock everything on day 1, they didn‚Äôt meet the primary goal of legendary perks.  They are something to work toward over time, a long term goal.
---
They aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúreward‚Äù for long time players.
---
 "The game is about grinding"
---
no the game is about having fun lmao.
---
Heh, feeding kids so won't be able to be on in a bit, take your time. If I happen to see you on then will contact.
---
Im not saying otherwise, im just letting you know what I heard. Half of working with software is knowing what bugs there are and how to avoid them. If you go through everything and follow all the weird steps that others say occurred, but never lose another challenge, its worthwhile that you can continue on. I dont think skipping the atom shop or legendary run, not looking at quests until 5 minutes after load and making sure to go into adventure or private before NW is a lot considering what it really means. Load into adventure/private, give the game time to load (2 -5 minutes) then carry on as normal. If it works, then boom yay. Still have an issue, need to figure out what is missing.
---
Nope still working.
---
Can confirm. I‚Äôm at like 300 hours and I don‚Äôt even flinch anymore
---
We need to speak to Grafton‚Äôs maor about that.
---
I've seen some streamers mention they enjoyed playing the game with wastelanders content, and that's how the game should've been at launch. As long as it's decent, not aggressive with mtx's pay2win stuff, I should enjoy it.
---
A few of the communities I'm in getting reports of bans as well. Guess it was bound to happen eventually.
---
Newbie here. What is B2525? Bloodied..?
---
I hate the NW challenges so much. I‚Äôd probably be better off just grinding 30k XP in adventure mode since the challenges like kill 9 creatures take forever, but at the same time I want all the score I can get lol.
---
They got Jason Mewes to voice Mort and I don't get to talk to him daily for anything. I am upset.
---
I wanted to romance him. :&lt;
---
Damn
---
I don‚Äôt know why you are getting downvoted. You aren‚Äôt wrong.
---
always rumors, almost never true. and if there are bans, its from a previous dupe, not this one.
---
most likely erectus bans
---
maybe screen caps of GTs in discords
---
I think it's ridiculous, over exaggerated, not realistic at all, and funny. I laugh, or jokingly imitate it. üòù
---
At least you guys get some sort of screen. On Xbox, FO76 either freezes and plays the same sound over and over until I close it OR just kicks to my dashboard
---
My game crashes at LEAST 2 a day. I have yet to not lose my shit every time it happens.
---
But at least you earned it. I have never duped, not accepted duped items, and have even removed ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on this game if I knew they duped. 
---
Everything I have I earned myself and I am proud of that. People who duped or accept duped items are pathetic. Why? Just so you can say you have one? Woohoo. But the real question is...did you earn it? No? Then you are nothing special and a sad player who thinks that some item makes you better then any other. Sorry to burst your bubble, it doesn‚Äôt. LoL
---
Ps: I have a few 3* guns I would be happy to give you a pick from for free if you would like. And no, there are no fixers/handmades lol. They are all legit, and I would be happy to give y one. Send me your psn name and I will add you.
---
I can‚Äôt finish the quest ‚ÄúFinal Departure‚Äù because the ID card scanner that would open the security door to the top floor isn‚Äôt there
---
Every battle royale rewards being afk. The point is to survive until the end. The only difference between this one and any other I play is with this one after hiding my way to top 10 I try to take a funny picture rather than finally start trying to kill people.
---
Ok well its been known since launch xp is no longer based off int. Its is based off multipliers and charisma cards
---
Yeah. I was thinking the same thing but then I get to the same result as you. I can just fast travel to a place close or when there is a ‚Äúdefend‚Äù event, anyone can fast travel to it anyway. So why make it inconvenient?
---
its a legacy explosive flamer
---
I would have ended it for the day. That‚Äôs rough.
---
Dat ass on duchess keeps me coming back
---
Wait so can we get banned for discussing ways to break into camps with glitches?
---
Some legacies are more offensive than others. I wish you could look me in the face and tell me that a game with pvp involved has a place for guns like BE GP‚Äôs and shit. Because i‚Äôd know it‚Äôs a lie. I‚Äôd LOVE an explosive harpoon, it‚Äôs my fav gun and mine is just a 1* junkies. But people aren‚Äôt going out in stealth boys with harpoon guns and dragons, they‚Äôre going out with stealth boys and BE or TSE frickin lazer beams and that shit needs to stop

Welcome to Fo76, the crazy train that is going nowhere.
---
Try the Message option when you highlight my name and see if that's the PM and not live chat.
---
Yes I know but they only show on loading screens if they are in the gallery.
---
So the door is locked and you can‚Äôt get through? You sure it‚Äôs the right door?
---
That would be a Legacy explosive flamer. They don't drop in the game anymore.
---
Yes.
---
45 as of last night.
---
I've been grinding the **** out of the 10,000 EXP = 125 score points.
---
And I'm still working 8 hours, Monday to friday.
---
PA perfectly fits the slot between regular armors and Legendary armors..
---
its got good DR.. you can prance around in nuke zones.. you can fall off the highest places in the world and live and if your STR is under 11 it will raise your carry weight..
---
PA is pretty great...
---
bloodied is a 1\* legendary effect. tied with junkie's for the best. 25/FFR means "25% faster fire rate", a 2\* legendary effect. also one of the best in the game. the second 25 is short for "25% less VATS cost", a 3\* legendary effect, which makes some weapons like automatic rifles essentially free to shoot when using VATS. they cost almost no AP with this effect.
---
More than some dumb season pass with trivial rewards, I would have liked to see all new Dailies and Events scattered throughout the world instead of THE ONES PLAYERS HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE THE START OF THE GAME.
---
But there are 2 things I have learned about Fallout 76. 
---
1. Don't expect much from Bethesda. You will be disappointed.
---
2. Don't expect the players to demand more pr consider quitting.
---
It really is pathetic. What is Fallout 76 anyways? 
---
It's not a survival game.
---
It's not an MMO. 
---
It's barely an RPG...
---
It seems to share a pool of 3 with the shack. So that can limit you if you have the shack built on your camp.
---
I'm kinda neutral about it. Was let down by the lameness of the converter, but the starry wall paper is nice. That said, I'm not really interested in most of it, as it's mainly ghille components and generic filler. I don't mind getting some of the things, but it doesn't really inspire me to play. Just feels like more busy work with so so rewards.
---
The mtx are so damn overblown by youtubers it‚Äôs absurd. You don‚Äôt need to spend any money.  
---
Repair gear at workbenches using scrap. That‚Äôs my #1 advice.  #2 is explore a lot and don‚Äôt rush the story. Allow yourself to get distracted.
---
Yes. It's a bug. Even quitting to menu or closing app doesn't consistently fix it. I couldn't get the proper icons back No matter what I did yesterday but this morning it was ok. 
---
I'm not saying it is patched, I take you at your word that it is messed up in your session, I'm just saying whether it is ok or bugged has been inconsistent for me.
---
The catch is that there are a good chunk of SCORE  to be gained from NW
---
Honestly... BOS combat armor, and BOS officer under armor.  I guess I role play?  Honestly through with sneak at 3 and head shotting everything I come across with an instigating handmade, being found is rarely an issue.  Clearly I don't play PVP, cause that shit would go south for me quick.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to him lol
---
Hope so but c'mon this would be too good to be true
---
You absolutely are better off grinding xp than doing that one. I can get 30k xp in like 15 minutes.
---
Would be nice on one hand, but all the legacy users would be wanting B2525 fixers like crazy
---
Yeah that‚Äôs probably a good description. Does 30 count as two 15s? I‚Äôm not even a bloodied build...
---
Worst memory ever then. Highest tier weapon sticks when you get it....
---
Count me in on xbox as well. I always love when people want to follow objectives and can hold their own. Gt narmyknight
---
What pvp.  Get your keester to NW for pvp.  Pvp anywhere else is non existant and looks to be preffered that way by most of us
---
Also crashed yesterday during SBQ. Glad I'm not the only one, for different reasons as it may be!
---
Not sure
---
What level are you in the season?
---
Exact quote from pcgamer magazine:
---
One of the biggest changes to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system in Fallout 76 is that buffing your Intelligence doesn't increase your XP gain. If you want to earn more XP for completing actions and slaying monsters you'll need to find and equip one of the Fallout 76 Charisma Perk Cards, Inspirational.Dec 11, 2018
---
Fallout 76 leveling guide: how to farm XP and level up fast ...
---
Hey dunno if you figured it out but I had the same issues, enabling mods in Game Pass on Fallout 76 next to where you launch the game fixed all those issues and the game runs great for me now.
---
Went ahead and got Fallout 1st for the month for I can play in private server with minimal lag and its decently close to a traditional fallout experience for me now. Was p laggy in public servers with ghouls glitching out not reacting to my presence at all. Dunno if that had to do with Gamepass launch.
---
Yeah, so can I a lot of times. It‚Äôs nice when the NW challenge is to place camps though, takes literally 3 seconds once you spawn in
---
Legacy flamer as others have stated. I think his is a suppressors.
---
It‚Äôs the same for me with graphics lag. It‚Äôs so pathetic compared to literally every other game on the market currently.
---
Who cares about pvp? Lol
---
Leave my AAE Gatling Laser alone!
---
I‚Äôll be on in about an hour...going to try to do 6 tonight.
---
Stimpack diffuser, Team Medic, Quack Surgeon, Inspirational
---
I wonder if they pay any attention to the in game player reports. Just caught two people (3 toons) duping at top of the world. Managed to get to the vendor before they did, bought the weapon (TSE Cryo) and threw it in the drink.
---
Reported all 3 accounts. Knowing my luck I'll be the one to get banned.
---
Surely it will be obvious server side who has been duping.
---
It doesn‚Äôt seem well thought out. What‚Äôs wrong with just awarding a point per level. That way, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you spent your perk point on. It‚Äôs an even playing field for everyone.
---
Why should the first explosive weapon I ever received off an enemy be deleted from my inventory? I‚Äôve had it for over a year and a half. Why do you think people should have legitimate drops taken from them?
---
No shotgun perks for me.just a single armor piece w block reduction and  everything melts in vats w my shotty
---
Im about two hours from getting online. Ill add you and join your server when I get on.
---
You are very welcome, friend!
---
Cool. Stay away from the pylons. I tank them all.
---
You mean aluminum?
---
He doesnt even know what world hes in
---
Damn, you could always hide it with boxes, floor decor or foundations. Maybe put it in a train yard if your up for moving campsites. You can probably find something to make it blend in a little better. Hopefully you're able to get something to work. Ots a pretty cool set piece.
---
Another quote for you this time directly from the game description of INT: "Intelligence is a measure of your overall mental acuity, and affects your ability to hack terminals, the condition and durability of items that you craft, and the return you get from scrapping"
---
It SHOULD have been like that at launch but also it shouldn't have been. 
---
Having barely anyone around added to the feel of the wasteland back then. I would play for an hour or two and not actually see another player. And then when you did see someone it felt great. 
---
And as for the lack of NPC's it didn't matter as some of the storytelling done through tapes and terminals is PHENOMENAL! Like there's a questline for The Order of Mysteries and it's one of my favourite side quests ever. The voice acting in this game is top notch. 
---
There's some really depressing stuff
---
Also. Spend your first 500 atoms on a collectron. It gathers junk and scrap at your camp or wokshop and junk and scrap make the fallout world go round.
---
Me too! All of thee above
---
It's true, fortunately I managed to spread the love before I was thankfully banned from this utter shit show of a game, grind on brothers...
---
Nope, better by a lot
---
You‚Äôre welcome! It definitely boggled my mind when I first saw the update. Hopefully they get it right in the next patch... or two
---
&gt;l 800 + 300
---
 800 + 300
---
they can ban anyone for anything.
---
It's more middle school level writing, the shallow plots, paper thin charecters, and the facade that any thing we do matters. 
---
And then there's the quests, especially the daily's; step 1-talk to person get quest, step 2- go to place, step 3-kill/loot person/thing inorder to pick up an item, step 4-return requested items.
---
Its fetch quests and always has been fetch quests.
---
But they‚Äôre keeping the terminal. Sometimes I just can‚Äôt with these morons.
---
50% are going to say its shit. 50% are going to say good.
---
Play it and find out.  Ive enjoyed it since launch
---
Anyone who just hides until the end instead of engaging in combat is obviously only doing it for a reward. You have no interest in actually playing the mode. No one enjoys hiding from everyone the entire time don‚Äôt give me that BS. The popular BRs incentivize combat over hiding.
---
Yeah. They will do that. Still, there is Enclave Gear.
---
What does this mean?
---
How much do you think they're worth¬ø
---
I've got one just collecting dust, and I don't use it.
---
Sorry for the confusion, I walk the border of the ring on the non fire side.
---
Yeah. . .People want to bitch. But, they don't want to do anything about it.
---
Last night I heard some random on my server who forgot they had their mic on full blown rage quit after yelling at the game for about 10 mins,  it was the most fun I have had in a long time
---
