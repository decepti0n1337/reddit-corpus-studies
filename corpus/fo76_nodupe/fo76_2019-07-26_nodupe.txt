I guess its time to get rid of that mutation.
---
Yes, SBs and AirDrops containers.. Just the same
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
Sad that the Thunder are some of the best characters in terms of writing and acting, and they're all dead.
---
My screen goes to the wrong resolution and the colours become a lot more intense after I tab out in a loading screen, requires a restart of the game to fix
---
I feel like this gif about sums it up:

I've only clocked-in about ten hours or so into the game so far, but is the "buggy" servers you mentioned the reason why the input delay is the way it is? Or is that simply how the game is supposed to be on consoles? What I mean is, picking up an item and shooting/killing an enemy seems to have a 1/4 or 1/3 second delay before it actually happens.
---
That I agree with totally. Three star enemies should be super rare, that would make getting the loot that much more rewarding. Legendary enemies do seem fairly common, but they should keep that to the one stars. Good for the low levels to grind on.
---
Yeah i'm have the same issue, along with CPU spike.
---
It's purely because I usually only have undiluted versions on me as I use the diluted ones on myself if I've just got a wee bit of radiation poisoning or something.
---

---
Oh god, same! I've got roughly 20 my stash, weighing me down. Will I ever use them? No. Will I ever get rid of them? Hell no!
---
Simply Googling HERBIVORE MUTATION would have told you:
---
HERBIVORE
---
Vegetables gives x2 benefits and no disease
---
Eat your greens! When you eat vegetables it gives you double benefits. With the consumables in Fallout 76 there is a small chance that eating them will give you a disease but with this mutation you can eat veggies in peace with no chance of getting a disease. There‚Äôs a catch though, if you have this Mutation you won‚Äôt be able to restore your Hunger by eating meat
---
I've also seen something about this not being a bug. Fairly sure it was Reddit, but I don't remember where or who said it. I'd love some confirmation from Bethesda themselves as to it being a bug or not, but I will say it's helped me get loot I wouldn't have otherwise gotten.
---
It's not supposed to.
---
I feel you. I have two in my inventory i would be devastated if i lost. A 3* Legacy Hand Crank Gatling that was gifted to me by a kind,random stranger back when i was still lvl 15. It was a proud day when i hit lvl 50 to use it,and is still my heavy hitter for Queen fights.
---
Other, is like you. A 2* pump action Suppressor's Shottie with 25% faster fire. Combined with Enforcer Perk, I've affectionately named it "The Crippler" since I've had scorched ghouls and Grafton Monsters down and crawling after a few shots.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC I‚Äôd be happy to make you one.
---
You may also just want to check out the quest Miner Miracles, which should show up if you head into the Ash Heap at level 25 or higher.
---
Thank you.  As a newer player whose best Legendaries are shotties, you are doing Atoms work.
---
Eyup! This happens once in a while, and it never ceases to be funny. I had a particular one of those I seriously wish I had recorded....
---
Long while back I had taken over Gorge Junkyard to do one of those SCORE "Claim a Workshop" things, but since I was a bit low on Black Titanium I thought I should try and extract some.
---
Then, as I was just poking around the boxes and containers around, I see someone claiming my workshop. Didn't care much, so I just went out to pick the last batch from the extractor, if it was still there.
---
So, as I show myself, I see this one dude next to the workbench, lvl 30-short, who pulls his pump-action and aims at me (a then-lvl111):
---
Noob: "You! Gimme all your ammo and stimpacks!"
---
Me: *\*Brain slowly parsing this Miniature Pinscher barking at an Ovcharka\**
---
Noob: "Can't you hear me you g\_y n\_\_\_\_r!? I said gimme all your stuff, or we're gonna f\_\_k your shit up!"
---
*\*Four of his friends come out of the shack behind the workbench, all of them below lvl 20, with barely a piece or two of leather/wood armor and armed with every bad melee (board, switchblade, pool cue, rolling pin, the works...) and pipe you could think off\**
---
Me, thinking: "Ohhh! So now I get to play [that one scene from SAO S1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUc8yVdmRqo). Very nice!"
---
Me (now quite amused): LOL, dude. Y'all couldn't kill me even if I let you- and you know; I'm gonna *let you* and see what happens. *\*I unequip all armor and clothes but headgear/mask and start doing the Funky Mothman Emote\**
---
Noob Leader: "Kill him! Now we can get his armor too!" (because that's how it's in Fo76, right? you drop your ARMOR when you die, yes?)
---
*\*They start attacking me en-masse, shooting me until they ran outta ammo and started going melee at me\**
---
&lt;5-10 mins later&gt;
---
Noob Leader: "The f\_ck you don't die, you g\_y n\_\_\_\_r!?"
---
Noob Mook 1: "We ain't doing him any damage; he makes the pain sound, but HP stays the same!"
---
Noob Mook 2: "F\_\_\_\_r tanked like two crits!"
---
Me: "So, you done? Now, my turn." 
---
*\*I pull out my Quad Double-Barrel Limb Damage Fast Reload Shotgun, headshots for everyone, 3 of them die.\** (I have Gun Fu)
---
Noob Leader: "F\_\_ks going on!?"
---
Noob Mook 3: "He's a hacker! Must have a godmode hack!"
---
*\*I shoot the remaining ones, including the Leader, and for max Meme points, I teabag his corpse while the idiot keeps shouting racist threats and momma jokes\**
---
**The End**
---
No idea if I ever actually got reported or not, but since that was over a month ago, I'd say no, but it was sooo hilarious; I've never been good at PvP, so it felt real great to cockblock all those griefer wannabes :P
---
Well, you could have posted a screenshot! üòÑ
---
I gots a stupid question does my luck stat affect  the chance of leg.drop. Will my 3* baddy drop fewer 3* items if my luck is low
---
Read again the last sentence of my comment. 
---
"They could simply add the choice" is not how things works, sadly. This topic was posted billion times and always ends the same.
---
that's why we give them to...military robots? Now I want to see a sentry bot swat a ghoul with a lead pipe
---
If on PS4 I can make you one
---
Also allow us to use combat rifle paints with the fixer because they are the same gun
---
Over 4000 and counting. I have issues.
---
I play on PC and I have a lot of QoL mods. I've never had a problem, nor heard/seen of anyone else having one. It should be perfectly safe.
---
It's one thing when the game has a finely tuned economy that real money can affect. World of Warcraft lets you use in game gold to pay for play time and you can use money to buy a quick chunk of gold. This game has no real economy, and most legendary weapons aren't worth the scrip they sell for. When only about 1/4 of the primary effects are actually viable for weapons, and a good chunk of weapons are either bad or have no business being legendary weapons (cough pipe weapons), there's honestly not much compelling argument to not find ways around the bullshit. If Bethesda cleaned up the legendary system so that you didn't so many duds, duping gear wouldn't be an issue. Saying "don't cheat" is ignorant of why the cheating is happening to begin with; the legendary economy is fundamentally flawed to an unusable degree.
---
Xbox sadly
---
And if you're on xbone i can make you one =0
---
This reminds me when I was in NW with my nephew. I'm still on very low Overseer Rank and tried my best in it But I didn't wanna be burden to him and his teammates. So I told him if I died, just leave and run, don't bother to revive me. That 9 years old told me NO MAN SHALL LEAVE BEHIND.
---
He's awesome in NW btw üòÅ
---
Definitely underwhelming. But what a great sound! It actually goes BONK! when you hit something.
---
Gonna ask some obvious questions
---
Did you use them and have you checked your stash?
---
Or just save some. I did it without having to move.
---
You can get atoms quite decently through challenges and the legendary run
---
That might be a modded weapon I never seen a weapon do that much dps before
---
Ughh that sucks. But that's an interesting roleplay!
---
Yes and oh thank you Fasnacht collector for all those prewar treats!
---
BE 50 is a disintegrator.
---
Awwh thank you, I was just hoping to find a fix to the glitch but I got downvoted into oblivion and I was bewildered as to why
---
Lmao you‚Äôre not getting on my team
---
I'm on an Xbox One X and getting a fair amount of crashes.
---
I'll try it out, thanks!
---
:(
---
My go-to strategy for Encryptid is to hop into a medi-pump power armor, fine the telltale legendary haze/cloaking shimmer of the Imposter, smack it a few times for credit, then go grab all the pylons and let the rest of the players take it down while I keep it vulnerable,  fun way to burn through stimpacks when they pile up.
---
How did you get your links like that I haven't done this shit in a long time.
---
&gt; so you admit youre adept at finding bobbleheads? Im not seeing the problem here...
---
.
---
&gt; OP: When I am not purposely out looking for them. When I am just out exploring.
---
&gt; maybe there is something to that method..
---
Honestly I think that with most of the original content. Like the responders are a wasted opportunity. Just by virtue of these factions being the original survivors trying to keep things going.
---
Forgive me for having a personality?
---
I fully support duping while Bethesda let's this stupid shit happen
---
It all happened in the usual Reddit style:
---
Before the ban - "why is there no ban? We üò° Beth" 
---
When announced - "we ‚ù§Ô∏è Beth" 
---
After a few hours as people vented, a million posts - "randomly flipping ‚ù§Ô∏è/üò° Beth"
---
Everyone who was suspended was innocent, we know that because the players said so. Anyone perm banned claimed it was an alt account, doesn't affect them, they will continue regardless. The world continues to turn daily, reddit continues to u-turn hourly.
---
Looks like a party!
---
I'm going to do my best not to buy any of those spaces. But, I work 12 hours shifts 6 days a week. I dont have a lot of spare time to grind every day for Score. 
---
I have already missed a few days of the dailies and I am behind. If I "work hard", as you suggest, then I could probably catch up. But that's not feasible for me to spend every waking moment i have on the game. My life has other priorities besides playing a game.
---
Please see the option to buy ranks in Score as another way for people to obtain the same rewards that people with more free time get to enjoy. I understand you feel that its an easy way out and feel people who buy ranks are just lazy, but its not like that for everyone who spends real money to advance on the score board.
---
I see people's camps and they have so much stuff that I haven't seen, nor heard of that i have missed out on due to work and other obligations. Having the ability to gain some of these items through my "hard work" outside of the game makes it that much more enjoyable for me.
---
You are supposed to be level 52 by today, so you are doing well.
---
If you find unique dialogue, definitely share it with the class!  Can you imagine Dylan Rhodes facing the hard truth he might actually need other people, getting to Foundation and realizing who Penny is. I'm sure he'd have some real kind words, haha.   
---
Her kid's father was probably a Garrahan. She's no angel, but the really dark stuff was definitely her old man. Would still be a very cool and interaction rich option to be able to call her out on all that evil elitist scum shit though.

Hits at about 2500-3000 per hit. Kills anything in 1-2 hits short of a sheepsquatch or SBQ. Then swap to range for limb crippling on scorchbeasts to force land them
---
For the love of god, i'd love to see your camp in game so I can flatten it
---
This honestly should not be a challenge. There's a fine line between a reasonable challenge and sitting in a bush for 15 mins 10x in a row. The XP gain, even if you win and have good kills, is incredibly low and makes this less of a challenge and more of a hassle. Honestly NW shouldn't be part of the SCORE. No I don't want to play NW, I don't want to revive people or kill X players, I don't wanna hunt 3 creatures. I want to play fallout, not spend my time creeping around and avoiding players in order to complete some less than exciting task.
---
It's much easier and fun to grind out 10k XP 5 times than it is to do some of these challenges because in adventure I can just run the same path and events back to back and be done by the end of the day, probably more than 5 times if I don't half-ass it and I can keep whatever loot I find.
---
It‚Äôs a First only emote. Sign up for first and you get it.
---
It's a fallout 1st exclusive
---
I got a 3200 atom refund before because I bought the Halloween bundle and mothman bundles only for the fog machines. They refunded both when they changed it so a camp could only have one fog machine at a time. I was actually pretty happy with their customer service
---
Thank you
---
They don't even answer tickets in the first place lol They just leave it to the automated bot. Which in itself is useless and doesn't even understand the problem described in the ticket.
---
They looked so tasty, why did you have to tell us this :(
---
Damn so basically Bethesda‚Äôs a dick and I‚Äôm fucked
---
Too many paying customers and too much work to investigate all, lol
---
Sure what's your gamer tag
---
but the actual true solution remains the same even if you keep phrasing around it. "The game" as in your local installed client doesn't have to load shit for the server to simply check beforehand if your space is taken. They just simply went with it and coded it to check when you load in but could very well change that and just let your client make the first connection, trigger the camp-check script that's currently run already anyway and just report the result (like already) to the player who's still waiting in the mainmenu (that's the part that actually changed). The error Bethesda made here was that initial requests from 2018 asked for a "check upon joining world" and...well literally put it in to only check when your local client fully loaded in but could've also just let it check beforehand.
---
I tier it. I have the 5 caps and under stuff. Then the 300 caps and up stuff. Even some 3 star gatling guns for thousands. Yeah.
---
Definitely not used them and I've checked my stash... now the crossbow has disappeared too.
---
I sell everything for 1 cap mind you its all low level crap :D
---
Wait, are you referring to the new cod fallout 76 dlc?
---
Lol there‚Äôs a treehouse with a computer in it up the hill a little it‚Äôs said to control all that to scare the tourists
---
Vendors like at watoga and Sutton are good places to start. Posting on r/fo76market is another theme I am seeing for these.
---
If only these were actual challenges and not tedious, boring collect-a-thons and busy work...
---
Are you in a public or private team? If in a private team already then chances are they messed that up when releasing public teams.
---
I doubt many people here would know that movie - it's going back awhile.
---
üëå üëç  It is set in Appalachia after all.
---
I‚Äôm running bloodied stealth commando now.  I like it better than my old shotgun/heavy gun bloodied I used for 100 levels.
---
that is if your power armor appears after you select it from your pip boy, takes 5 seconds for it to appear in front of me so i can put it down in some areas
---
I am getting flashbacks.
---
+1
---
U on xbox? If u are I'm gonna hook you up bro
---
Ohhh ok. Maybe I'll look into getting First. I play a lot so it could be worth it.
---
Definitely. That happens to me too all of the time.
---
The only ones that don't auto complete from just playing 2 hours are the camp ones, and I enjoy making weird displays at workshops to make the score. Never feels like busty work to me. But to each their own.
---
Why?
---
Level 56, and I require 2400 to make it to level 57. 
---
It does seem like an extra 25 xp got slipped in somewhere.
---
Guy continues triggered rant....
---
Guy is conflicted with own trash behavior in game.
---
Can confirm this guy is a trash gamer.
---
What if the preserved pie was infested aswell :o
---
They won't use red asylum outfits, those are too easy to get now that they unbanned all the dupers. You will need to be wearing the wood mask and a full set of thorn armor with a shielded raider underarmor
---
I spent two hours always getting in the top 15 on my lv35 overseer rank, no rank up, this one is far too grindy! Perhaps tomorrow I should try it with a fresh character, would that be faster?
---
Therefore it‚Äôs better to play the game if you want the most xp per match.
---
Whatever you say, loser. Can confirm this dude is a total failure.ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
If you're in a decently populated server odds are pretty good that a bevvy of players will swarm the place to assist you, everyone wants that fixer plan.
---
Wait I‚Äôm putting 10mm at zero, does that work also or did I go overboard
---
Damn snob wanted to blow off her leather face
---
And fix the scrip math where you don't have a couple left on the table because nothing adds up to 150.
---
If it‚Äôs not letting you unsubscribe through your Xbox account on your computer you need to contact Xbox support, not Bethesda
---
The cursed weapons from the upcoming event are a good start, but...way too little too late. I mean, a harpoon gun and pickaxe? What about a cursed 10mm pistol with a higher capacity and fire rate? And before they changed it, the harpoon gun had faster fire rate...which is literally useless on it. Now I think it's bash damage, which is microscopically less useless
---
I've never really paid attention to the voice lines in that event but those sound like things Bethesda would say
---
Lol isn‚Äôt that always the way.
---
Really NOT acceptable...
---
Someone three-shotted the Queen today in the middle of her white-squirt flight. Haven't seen it the entire time dupers were banned. Then today it happened. Everyone was pissed.
---
Report them. It's gotten out of hand. I've seen camps with upwards of ten of them going. When you're exploiting on a literally industrial scale like that, you deserve the ban hammer.
---
[removed]
---
What platform are you on?
---
Why not both?
---
I was wondering why there was a sudden dropoff in camp owners theatrically appearing from a giant cloud of fog while I perused their wares.
---
Are you on pc
---
Private. Should we try public?
---
Be prepared to pay 12.99$ for it
---
Nice try but I move around to much.
---
Exploit.
---
I've done this event many times and have yet to get the max 100 ore reward. Since I'm a bloodied build I can't collect the ore so I use a shotgun and cripple the ghouls. And yet, people still just run around killing them and not collecting ore.  
---
I've been trying to get the radioactive barrel plan so I could irradiate myself quickly when first starting 76 but no luck.
---
Nothing in NW has been more amusing to me than the times I had a firefight raging around my little bush and no one noticed me, or when a guy ran right through my bush and still didn't notice me.
---
It's a hacked weapon, keep it forever and delete this post or you could face a ban.
---
Sounds interesting, do you always expect members to have their mic on? as I can't always do voice chat

I don't think it is allowed to talk about exploits here, nor do i recommend you use one.

If you see somebody with one, use the report function. People openly exploiting bugs need to be dealt with, and they deserve whatever they get.

I usually don‚Äôt see which events they are interested in. Sometimes they aren‚Äôt near an event for me to reference. Next time I‚Äôll just join and see what happens lol thanks!

Sorry. was in the shower. GT:
---
Rammadeus. Camp is near top of the world. Just a raider leg yeah?
---
Yeah I just logged in to find myself with this same issue on Xbox One. I cycled power and the game and it didn‚Äôt help. Thought it was a UI glitch so I tried completing the ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù ones but it didn‚Äôt do anything. Only had a bubblegum daily and NW to do :(
---
Look I‚Äôm still not sure you see my point. YES it is relatively easy to get this challenge complete, however you should get more of a reward for doing more work right? I‚Äôm not speaking to the difficulty of the challenge alone I‚Äôm referring to how more work isn‚Äôt translating to more of a reward in this game and to me that seems like something bethesda should think about tweaking. Sure keep both of these challenges in the game, but don‚Äôt make me spend three times the resources to get the same reward, because that‚Äôs just short changing the player and feels like a shitty move.
---
Just the right leg

Sorry new to reddit not sure how to yet

People need to stop comparing this to other games . If you don't like the way things are . Don't play . Go play your other games you like so much
---
Didn‚Äôt realize it was an exploit. Just noticed it happened sometimes
---
That's why items should get a lock feature where you can just prevent your item from being traded, or stored unless you unlock it.
---
This is why TES3 Morrowind will always be one of my fave Bethesda games. You'd find items in hidden in places you'd never think of. Really encouraged and rewarded you for exploring
---
The challenge given, wether directly or indirectly comparative is fruitless. A guy at level 10 doing the level up challenge abd the guy at level 500 both get the same score, but one is obviiously much more worm than the other. Some people have tons of gum on them(me), so how many pieces is arbitrary, others have none and have to get creative. The difficulty doesnt matter, just completing the challenge, no matter what it is.
---
Hello . Wastelanders was the free update that added npc‚Äôs into the 76 world. I myself quit and came back and enjoyed my time. I still find the endgame staying power lacking, but in my opinion the new story in a fresh play through or old play through is worth the time invested. 
---
Long story short their is more content to try for free but don‚Äôt expect a 100% bug free game.

Yeah, I like the benefits they offer! Legendary and treasury stuff sounds pretty good to me lol

Unpopular opinion: I prefer the strangler heart power armor

You could give it a try though I wouldn#t get my hopes up. Seems like they messed that up then when trying to hide quests from public teams.

as a (displaced) native, I'm very glad to hear you enjoyed your visit to the wild, wonderful state. I see you tried the unforgettable tudor's and also got yourself a pepperoni roll  - a must for all visitors. your video touched on some of the terrific discoveries to be made in WV. I think bethesda did almost heaven right proud in re-imagining a post-apocalyptic appalachian state. part of the reason I love this game so much is because running through the hills and hollows reminds me of my days spent in my youth, doing the same. thanks for such a great post about your trip!

Fortunately I've never had a weapon or outfit/armor disappear due to a glitch, but just the other day I had two of my displayed junk items vanish. I've got a tall display case in my living room with a lighthouse souvenir, undamaged trifold flag, fancy framed lighthouse photo and one of the undamaged willowed vases you can find at the Whitespring. I saw someone else's camp where they had a poster with lighting clipped into the closed tall display case to provide lighting, so I wanted to swap to that case to try it myself. I manually pulled all 4 items out, swapped the case, and decided to put them back before placing the poster and messing with the rug trickery; except, wait a minute, where the hell did my trifold flag and framed photo go? They're not in my inventory, not in my stash, not on the ground in a paper bag, they're just fucking gone. Maybe they were somehow auto scrapped into my scrapbox, but I had the lighthouse souvenir and vase in my inventory, and I'd think if that happened it would've happened to all 4. It only took a quick trip to AMS to replace them, but now I'm paranoid that any item I remove from a display case could just up and disappear on me, which is especially worrying when I've got a Fasnacht Raven and Deathclaw mask on display right next to the aforementioned junk items.
---
Yeah, my main thing would be having to deal with higher level monsters. I just want to be useful haha
---
Usually on login, and when I finally got in I found my challenges auto completed!
---
I had a girl do this to me yesterday. Extremely rude and I'd never think of doing such a thing. As for a card, just look for 3 vertibirds and a cargo bot will be close by. Itll have a keycard if you can take it out. You can also do a mission to get one about once every hour or so at the red console in the whitespring bunker Hope this helps. If your on ps4, add me.

Oh it‚Äôs fine just saying that it‚Äôs Xbox I didn‚Äôt think hacked weapons can get on anything but pc? How would they do that

This is why I love this event so much. There's so many enemy spawns. I typically dislike having to protect/escort some NPCs, but this one gets a pass for being so good. I love being attacked by an overwhelming number of enemies.
---
Is it one of the items you keep after canceling 1st?
---

---
same here, I'm suffering to get to 23k to buy one serum plan lol, I just don't go to trader hubs couse on ps4 you need to add people as friends in psn to be able to find them in game, is just hell stupid to be like that.
---
Oh nice. Didn‚Äôt know. Guess I learn something new everyday. That‚Äôs some serious damage tho
---
Yup that's still happening, and the official response from Bethesda is that "we can't provide missing score" so won't do anything at all to help us!
---
As soon as you get 10K XP it repeats, you should be repeating about 16 times a week
---
If thats the challenge. Honestly, would be simple too. Make a new character, run my ass off to the nearest big time events and keep from dying. Done in an hour. 
---
You forget, higher numbers dont necessarily mean higher difficulties. We all have ways to get shit done quick. 
---
My current character is 103, without pushing my XP like some do i level up at least once a day, sometimes twice. This isnt difficult and im doing it anyway for the most part. Why not make ut part of the challenge?
---
They also told us 1000 other things that have been cancelled, removed or lied about. Don't expect something to happen if they told us so weeks or months ago.
---
Yeah. I solo the queen so now I don‚Äôt have any use for the cryo. I do have a tse cryo I got a while back tho
---
I'm on PC using a Xbox controller
---
This is definitively not the case for many people.
---
My impression is that the separation from the frame was an odd but deliberate aesthetic choice. It makes the armor look bulkier. You can even see the beam holding the plate to the Chasis, so it's not like it's just floating.
---
I'm already going bald... This just makes my hair grey.
---
Im so glad you enjoyed it! Once I get home and get internet I‚Äôll post more. It‚Äôs been AMAZING. Hard to leave honestly. And Tudors? O.m.g. Left us SPEECHLESS. I‚Äôve already emailed their HQ about getting some in our state!!
---
Yeah I figured you were on pc but wasn‚Äôt 100% sure
---
You can play on PC with an xbox controller and it will change the glyphs to match, so this could also be PC
---
Bro, everything in this game is fucked, bethesda doesn't care so why should you
---
Every time I submit a ticket over this they just auto lock the ticket with not even an automated response anymore!
---
Shit I have had a bunch of them  but never thought they where good I‚Äôve scripped most. I have a 2 star bloodied one a quad one and maybe some other ones. Haven‚Äôt tried the bloodied one out. But I just found out it does some amazing things to the queen
---
Like ?
---
do you guys could finish the buring gold? I already did that event like 20 times and yet did not get the archievement and I get I think 24 magazines so far and read all of them too and didn't get the archievement.
---
Yeah shit sorry didn‚Äôt think about how Xbox controllers and ps4 can be used on pc.
---
Encryptid is hard enough, but major props to you for also making it a nuke zone.
---
You say you use Apollo but you link Imgur?
---
It happens to me quite regularly on PS4, I've lost 3 days worth of dailies and more than half a set of weeklies!
---
It does more damage then it says it does
---
If you're Angry Turtle you repeat it 16x daily
---
I keep seeing that Scorched Earth pop up! I guess my main thing is that I just want to be useful and contribute lol This is probably just be over analyzing per usual. I know some people don‚Äôt really care.
---
This dude posted a picture of prewar West Virginia like we wouldn‚Äôt notice
---
So , my advice is to keep ATOMS as possible as you can this theme should be fun with BoS stuff
---
I love ‚Äúthe grind‚Äù
---
It's in the weeklies simply because there's nowhere to place repeatables. It's on a continuous loop and if you click past 10k any excess automatically goes on the next cycle.
---
No, not always, you should be fine.
---
Explosive legacies and 1 pound bobby pins I guess.
---
Two shot medics??
---
I was wondering if there is any setting tweaks that could sort it as it's annoying sitting next to an oven playing a game that shouldn't be as demanding as it is.
---
The worst thing about this, not only does Bethesda not care enough to do anything to help us, support are actively suppressing our cries for help, my tickets get auto locked before I even get the automated response anymore!
---
"Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to edit/grant S.C.O.R.E."
---
You push this whole mini game for cosmetic items, only available here skins... But when the system breaks... It's an "oh well." 
---
I grind this when i can due to work, kids, wife and other life aspects also needing time, so not like I can do like some people and spend 5 to 6 hours on a grind.  Then you don't get rewards you work for due to some system problem and you get the "whelp we can't adjust that, good luck " canned response.
---
It‚Äôs been pretty bad bug since wastelanders where I‚Äôve vats and saw a enemy and it sometimes would be legendary but once I got closer they would drop dead in front of me. I‚Äôve never bothered with dropping nukes really but two so I‚Äôve not encountered this but I know the enemy dropping dead has happened a ton to me
---
I'm lvl 430. I do events for scrip, xp, and gold. Plus the occasional chance at rare loot. Sometimes I like to create my own Building team. When the event is near the end, I'll switch it to an Events team for extra xp then switch it back.
---
Currently. Epoch and normal game modes with multiple intensive mods without my pc turning into a furnace üòÇ.
---
Cool, just saw your invite. I will be on most the evening probably
---
I get three legendary spawns in one run through whitespring easy-peasy
---
Yeah but it starts over before i get to 10k
---
Yeah it is
---
Dont be surprised if that glitch comes back around. I have a feeling its a thing now.
---
I was really really worried for a second when I read that as "the *white power* armour skin", rather than "the white *power armour* skin". Carry on.
---
Juicy fruit, it‚Äôs gonna move ya
---
When on fo76 was released, i was scared mostly by the paintings frickin rotating when i dont look at them and ground started shaking and screams. I just discovered the location and ran away and never came back there.
---
I think it comes down to them testing things. They want to see completion rates for different amounts of the same activity. Why we get kill 1 and 3 legendary enemies in the same week for dailies. If the completion rate is too low (looking at kill 9 creatures in NW) they will lower/scrap it. If completion rate is the same (1/3 bubblegum, 1/3 MW camp deploys) they know they can just pick one, or go with the slightly lower completion rate
---
I honestly don‚Äôt remember not the orange one I think
---
Seasons model is pretty garbo and I just want 76 to stop trying to make money off me.

---
So when I wrote
---
&gt;[This article](https://slate.com/culture/2019/12/redneck-origin-definition-union-uprising-south.html)
---
I wrote it as
---
    [This article](https://slate.com/culture/2019/12/redneck-origin-definition-union-uprising-south.html)
---
If you ever link Wikipedia or something that has parenthesis right at the end you need to watch out because you might end up with a broken link like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Savage_(football_fan)) randomly chosen article. Notice how that link is broken because Reddit thinks that the first closing parenthesis is ending the link, but you can make Reddit "ignore" a character using the backslash \\. Or write it as
---
    [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Savage_(football_fan\))
---
so that it ignores that closing parenthesis and includes it as part of the url instead of closing the hyperlink.
---
That really sucks and havent had that issue before. I have a glowsighted crossbow and some bolts you can have if you want.
---
You can only place it on the ground, not foundations.  The good news is that it places most anywhere, but like you said if the ground isn't relatively flat one side or the other floats.
---
A side note: if half of it is on the ground, the other half can be on a foundation.
---
Put the accelerated barrel on it and see if it melts a sheepsquatch or some large tanky creature. If it does and you have no damage cards on than its probably magic.
---
If you are on a busy server start it they will come for it make sure there are a couple higher levels there I never pass one up
---
Magic weapons are bugged when certain combinations of standard mods result in massive increases to damage (and/or occasionally range). They aren't glitched as its standard game mechanics gone wrong and so using them technically isn't breaking any rules. Some have already been patched out and I suspect more will follow so what might be magic one day could be magic for ever, or for minutes.
---
I just now switched my name like a few hours ago and I didn't realize it automatically put numbers at the end ebacause it was taken,so my real gamertag is datoneboi9769,sorry for the messup
---
I use a mixture of vampire heavy guns/vanguard armor.   As long as you‚Äôre putting rounds on target, you‚Äôre basically invincible, great for a team-focused support role.
---
I logged into the game 20 HOURS after the daily reset, and I was still missing 5 dailies and 6 weeklies!
---
Yeah, the placement there doesn't work anymore.  I've played around with moving it but I can't find that sweet spot.  Must be pretty small.  Or maybe it is harder to do on a private server.
---
I'll try on the Behemoth that spawns in the lake
---
I saw someone set off fireworks. They look so bad on the xbox.
---
76 isn‚Äôt cross play
---
Plans for Raider armor is uncommon to rare which is dumb considering it's little more than strapping scrap metal to you.
---
If it‚Äôs a vampire explosive weapon do you know if the area dmg of the explosive ability will also trigger the vampire ability?
---
Not only are Bethesda refusing to help anyone affected by this crippling bug, support are actively suppressing our cries for help, locking after an automated reply before you reach a person, now its auto locking immediately after posting it with no response at all!
---
Is this really happening cause that‚Äôs a huge problem...
---
Sweet thanks.    Also I set you up for Google it comment I'm disappointed in you lol. Again thanks I haven't been on reddit in ten years or so.
---
Hi, please, buy some atoms, support the game!
---
Xbox is only xbox. Pc is only PC. Sadly we can't play with each other.
---
If you get a big kill or complete a quest it can jump forward hundreds or even thousands. It doesn't need to be exact and any excess will roll over.
---
I haven‚Äôt invited anybody lol ‚Äúsaid the lone wanderer‚Äù
---
Quality contribution
---
From launch, this is definitely enough of an improvement to play again. Thank you for the detailed responses boys! I am re downloading as we speak. See you in the wasteland.
---
Xbox players play with Xbox players, PC players play with PC players (regardless of launcher)
---
So if you are on PC you can play with your steam friends. If you are on Xbox you cannot.
---
It is a glitch they are aware of it but don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre doing anything about it it‚Äôs Bethesda after all same thing with me I can‚Äôt get the dark matter jet pack skin only the light one
---
I don‚Äôt have one, my .50 is vampire, my auto grenade launcher is two shot
---
Yes.
---
thank you! i wasn‚Äôt sure if it depended on the launcher or not!
---
Was it in your inventory or your stash? Bethesda never fixed the stash steal bug because people assumed it only effected people who exploited the budget, when it actually affects everyone!
---
Definitely getting worse.  I can‚Äôt seem to fast travel anywhere anymore and it‚Äôs honestly sucking any fun out of the game for me.
---
Automatic rifles (handmade, combat rifle, assult rifle) if you have less AP used it can shoot for quite a while.
---
What you have to understand about vats is it stops AP regen and AP will regen when out of vats while not jumping or running.
---
Ok
---
You serious, Clark?
---
The extra perks from the packs will be useful when we need to level up our Legendary Perks. That we‚Äôll probably get in Patch 37.
---
That's reasonable.
---
I like this idea BUT
---
Since having more camp items adds to its load time, please please please please don‚Äôt spawn our character in until the camp finishes loading. So so so so so tired of falling and dying or getting stuck in someone‚Äôs floorboards.
---
If you play a lot it is absolutely worth it. Bought a year for both my wife and myself and have no regrets. The travel tent and the scrap box are both godsends. The private server is great if you need to do mass gathering and are tired of finding places empty of all the good stuff. The skins and emotes aren't bad and you can't beat $16.50 in atoms for $8 a month is a hell of a deal.
---
Hah, true.
---
It was crazy on day one, it's unimaginable now. 
---
Everytime I hear this "cant be done" excuse I'm taken back to 2003 and the mmo (from EA no less) Earth and Beyond. I did a quest and didn't get the item. 
---
Do I file a bug report? Wait for days and days? No! 
---
I use the in game chat to contact a Game Master and in in less than 2 mins they say "sorry about that, I put the reward in your inventory. Have a nice day"
---
Get stuck in terrain? There's a command for that. 
---
As much as I love fallout, some parts of this game are fucking ridiculous.
---
Well I mean they did say the atomic shop was going to be cosmetics only and they couldn't increase stash limit any due to performance or something of the like, only for them to turn around and sell the scrap box which allows unlimited junk. If they couldn't increase the stash limit the least they could do was give everyone the scrap box, but they'd rather create artificial problems and sell the solutions to us
---
Containers being linked to the stash is one of the primary causes for server lag!
---
Magic Combat Shotguns or a Fixer.  A reduced VATS Handmade would be choice 2. The Railway or Lever are also solid choices for VATS.
---
Xbox website under subscriptions. Disable auto renual (dont cancel as it will disable fo1st)
---
Zoning, enemies will be of a certain level based on where they are
---
Likely will need to run it a few times for that.
---
Why would you ever exit your power armour? I carry 2 (one on me always and forever) and second excavator for loot hauling when I'm overweight.
---
I don't even remember how my character face looks anymore or what number on his vault suit is.
---
I'm pure PA build, animation was never issue for me because I rarely leave my safe-tin-can
---
In certain areas enemies have a wide range of levels depending on who walks through. So in this case a high level guy walked through which caused a spawn of high level enemies but he didn't kill them so they stay there rill someone kills them. 
---
Try and server hop when you see enemies way above your level.
---
You have to adjust your perks to match your weapons as you get higher in levels your enemies do to
---
Literally no one who I know duped got banned. I'd guess they only caught a handful of duped weapons and then just banned people with those weapons.
---
Tried logging out and back in earlier, it didn't fix anything alas...
---
Dont surprise me..a lot of nukashine and toxix soot flower since those days.
---
Grafton monsters craw?
---
thank you for your reply
---
You missed out the broken lunchboxes.
---
Pistols work very well with VATS and Gun Fu, especially with a little Stealth. People write them off mainly because of their early game experience devoid of perks, mutations and legendaries. I've gotten 2k out of my pipe pistol, and Line in the Sand is easy to solo with a Revolver. SBs, Behemoths, Mirelurk Queens...all fall to my 'useless' guns. 
---
Most people are seduced by rifles and heavies claiming more damage, but of course late game these also would be rubbish if you took the original base weapons to battle.
---
Better than me, I'm at 43, the auto complete bug has been vicious....
---
The problem withis that you and everyone are looking online.
---
Go private and forget about it.
---
Go do a quest or two and you'll find one.
---
*Trying* is the problem sometimes.
---
Also this might be too soon to start recommending this advice....but unlike other fallouts you can‚Äôt be a jack of all trades kind of character in the end game so to help a little you could try to focus on a specific build and drop a lot of the quality of life perks but if you don‚Äôt wanna do that I‚Äôd suggest just doing other side objectives in the regions that don‚Äôt scale up to high in level. The forest region around vault 76 won‚Äôt spike to high levels
---
You can build one in the smaller, more ball-like dishes though. At least the outline is green...I always like my places too much to try and find out myself.
---
Bit if you were to remove any one of them people would be up in arms.
---
All DLC is free, including Wastelanders. 
---
The BR mode is... it‚Äôs still pretty rough. Lots of untouched hacking going on, not too greatly balanced, overall very trying. A good match is very, very good. But doesn‚Äôt happen too frequently. 
---
 It is more stable, and far better, but still an absolute wreck in a few... many... uh, most aspects, honestly. It can be a try on patience. When it works as intended, it is a great time.
---
I‚Äôm happy to lend a hand if you need, always available to assist a fellow waster.
---
Tbh most people do it just for the XP and legendaries. I've done the event about a dozen or so times and only once completed it cuz most people just want kills.
---
I've seen people do that, but it's not much space to build in.
---
Game like 76 GAAS I don‚Äôt see any problem with ATX even if it‚Äôs Utility item ..
---
I agree with the regarding the Stash limits &amp; Scarp box
---
That's why you buy things you need
---
Hey I was able to get the vault 76 holo tape from the mr handy just outside vault 76. He‚Äôll just give it to you if you miss it inside the vault.
---
This plus if you're in a team other people doing quests. Those seem to give a lot of xp.
---
Exp as i need all the perk cards I can get my hands on for future content and loot as I may have a few hundread thousand steel but its never enough.
---
I have only ever hidden in bushes in NW. 
---
I have never fired a weapon, killed a player or creature. I can usually get to top 10. Best finish was 2nd. I don‚Äôt mind if I never finish 1st. If I have to do NW for score points, I‚Äôll just keep hiding in bushes.
---
ill help you if you return the favor I know a good spot
---
It‚Äôs a repeatable... it says it right on it
---
I was showing the screenshot from the apollo app which is allows you to view and post to reddit.  The app has a direct image upload icon which is missing from the website viewing of this sub.
---
Imgur =/= apollo.
---
Your build probably isn't optimized. Look up builds on www.falloutbuilds.com and create an account/rework your current one so that it is dedicated to one weapon type with perks that synergize well.
---
Okay
---
lol kiddy baby whiner
---
That really screwed over my first character who legitimately farmed loads of stuff!
---
whats your ign?
---
Most of the time i have to move it between waves and sometimes it takes 2 or 3 attempts. Every now and then i cannot get it to work at all
---

---
Np, dawg. Now go kill that poser squatch!
---
I have the same bug. Set everything. Press start. It gives a sound effect and sergeant Radcliff makes a comment that it isn't right but nothing can be change short of swapping the brains out. Super irritating
---
Everytime I received a refund for something I bought off the atom store, I went through Microsoft support, not bethesda's support. Not sure if bethesda will give back money but microsoft definitely does and you keep what you bought.
---
You can go higher with unyielding armor and a backpack.
---
It's simply an XP/Legendary event now. Few people can be bothered to run for ore as they don't care about the other rewards, and those that do miss out in the seasons xp race. I've pretty much given up with it.
---
Because they want you to open your perk packs instead of saving them for ranking up legendary perks.
---
They are sold by one of the White Spring vendors that sells all the fancy furniture plans.
---
Yo brother I definently understand the frustration I've been feeling the same way myself. So many bugs and stuff auto completing it's very demotivating. I dont have much that I can offer buy I do know the fixer plans and can make you a level 50 version and mod it for you ad well. Add me my ign is duins. I'll hop here in about 10 mins. I think I have all the junk I need but I'll need to look as I've been playing less and less.
---
Or restore strong back to its former glory, people might actually use it then!
---
Dude it like. 200-300 bullion it's not that bad
---
The couple thousand caps tho...
---
wonderful, will i be able to find it as titled?
---
its Milk\_Mommy
---
You could also look into one of the factions. They do some pretty awesome questing. Just today we did a ‚Äúrestore power to Appalachia‚Äù one that was pretty fun and way more team based than anything I‚Äôve done in FO76 before. It was with [The Enclave](https://discord.gg/vKQ7bZ), if you wanna check out the discord.
---
Yes.  I remember seeing spinning wheel. :)
---
I've had that happen before with other enemies, but not the SBQ or Scorchbeasts.
---
Today, I went into the Enclave bunker and all the protectrons kept falling dead in front of me for some odd reason.
---
The reason why you don't do good damage is probably you have a bad/terrible build. At your level I was 1 shotting level 60+ ghouls.
---
This morning a level 4 was getting owned at fertile soil, which is right next to my camp where I was messing around decorating.
---
I just down, ran over and invited them to party up. I was too lazy to put my mic on, so I emoted my way walking them through the event, showing them where a cap stash was, a safe which I unlocked for them, and a few other things. 
---
Then had them follow me to my camp where I made them fully modded level 5 armor and a 10mm submachine gun. Then lead them to my adhesive farm to get corn, the river to get water, logs to get wood and then my stove so they could cook. 
---
After that I had to meet up with my gf so I friended them, waved good by and left, but kept them in the party. Hopefully they hit me up if they need anything.
---
It's not a demanding game though.  If you have mods installed then maybe get rid of those and see if you are still having issues.  I would honestly expect one of those before the game.  
---
I used to occasionally play it on an 8 year old computer as well as my current one which I solely use now.  Neither computer ever made any more fan noise than when playing any other game.
---
Even if when you join a team and fast travel if it shared the other players pictures if you fast travel on them would be a coool feature
---
Got an Executioners SS -90%RW shovel I keep on me just for that quest.
---
Personally I think 3* should drop 3or2* but not 1*. 2stars 1or2   and 1* as 1* that slight tweak would be a vast improvement without making it too much easier. Also think instead with the SBQ or wendgo colloss they  should make lvl 55 or 60 weapons/armor drop that way the old legacy weapons are just that legacy. Also have 100+ lvl servers we can join ie current max lvl critters spawn in low lvl zones
---
You got me intrigued.   I have this bad habit of characters being made specific to a build. I have a one for unarmed one sneak rifle and one power armor heavy guns. 
---
I know I‚Äôll never make it to lvl 400 with so many different characters but I like mine themed without having to swap around stats after 50.
---
Any automatic gun, the best ap cost per bullet I've found is the handmade rifle!
---
Have to show the bright side of the game, just so that if they meet those few toxic, they know the good out weighs it by a lot.
---
I'm with the person that said build it up and after a while burn it all down and start over. 
---
That's one of my favorite bits of the building mechanics in this over other survival/building games. You can move almost anywhere on the map and take your base with you. Since I came back to the game with wastelanders I've lived on a handful of foundations with no walls next to a junk pile (all function no form). I've had a nice McMansion on the water with a nice riverboat bar for Beckett. I had a basic strip mall set up for a while there and currently occupy both sides of the road overlooking the dam with a couple of tiny 2x2 houses, a tiny 2x2 50's style cafe and my vendors in a small nook that looks like something out of a tiny, midwest truck stop. 
---
Best way to go about it is to just start slapping things down and see what works. I'll "finish" a build after a couple of hours then slowly fine tune things over time when I see a spot that could use an extra item or two. If you have the budget for it razorgrain is great for decorating and adding a bit of color to some of the more greyed out areas. 
---
Good luck and have fun with it.
---
Not always, just in the last year I'd say
---
You get XP for each event your public teammates complete, but no other rewards. That's why you always join a group when you login.
---
That and you really need to look at trading up on your armor and weapons once you start venturing out into areas with those higher level enemies. A level 5 wep just isn‚Äôt going to cut it.
---
It's not a bug. It's a feature. Sometimes after Line In the Sand, if the damn thing dies on the roof of the Asylum, go to Watago and things will be okay.
---
I've noticed the pile up DURING THE EVENT too, of bodies at the elevator door in Arktos Pharmaceuticals. Really awesome instead of poking around with a stick and a camera for a half hour trying to find that dead triple-star cricket you killed in the heat of the moment.
---
Thank you very much!
---
You've made a game sound like a job.
---
No in all cases of this game 1 &lt; 3. Given the normal challenge of level up once it‚Äôs strictly harder to do the level up 3 times. Now given your level obviously the net xp you have to earn is dependent. However once again you‚Äôre ignoring my entire point and going back to relative difficulties of things. In this example wether you are level 1 or level 300 you would still be doing 300% of your normal work for the same base 100% of the original reward. Here if you were a contractor and you say had to in one day repair one roof for say $1000. And then the next day you hade to instead repair three roofs that were identical to the first for only $1000. You would be a bit upset that given your increased work you were not given proportional pay right?  While the situation I proposed is clearly more work than leveling or eating gum the same concept can be applied; you should get rewards proportionate to the work put into the task. Another absolute bullshit example of Bethesda pulling this is the ‚Äúplay for 7600 hours‚Äù challenge only rewarding 40 atoms which is not much of an increase when compared to numerous other challenges in the game. If you spent 7600 hours playing this game only to recieve the same amount of atoms that you can get from killing 76 creatures or some other challenge you are clearly being screwed over. 
---
I understand that your point is than relatively speaking none of these challenges are by any means difficult, but as I‚Äôve pointed out numerous times one day setting the standard to one piece of gum or one level up and then LITERALLY THE FOLLOWING DAY asking you do consume 3 times as much of your resources to get the same reward is just a feels bad.
---
You are still having your mother buy things for you?
---
The game's spaghetti code but also Bethesda's game mechanics themselves. If there would be no market for duped weapons there would be far less dupers. They should've allowed legendary crafting (and maybe in the future specific effect crafting) way earlier and with far less grind. To 'stop' duping at this point they would probably need to overhaul the whole netcode and huge chunks of the base game to introduce industry standards of coding.
---
That's very similar to an old bug in Skyrim. Same engine so not surprised.
---
You should hear about my job then, haha. Its not a job, just doing what what is needed to complete the challenge. I havent had an issue completing any challenges and most of the time im dont in an hour.
---
The bicycle shack in the Mire
---
Best thing to do is run 3 tunnels at the very beginning and then just camp on top of the scavenger on the raised middle bit. 
---
Should still be 1 or 2 alive after 3 tunnels worth of ore.
---
Are you healing the NPCs as well?
---
The problem with builds as I found is you need a good weapon to build around no point in building around miniguns for example then you get a god roll fixer as you gonna have to level a ton to get anywhere. Also its difficult to change builds without the cards because of how the games designed you can swap them out and in sure but unless you have the cards its a LOT of grinding for a potential decent weapon.
---
It‚Äôs very hit and miss for me.  I‚Äôve seen teams of 7-8 absolutely annihilate it, getting 100 ore in 5 minutes with not a scratch on the survivors, then I‚Äôve also seen no one show up, or teams of level 20-40 players join and get stomped.  I agree with others, many look at it as a pure xp farm now, much like line in the sand.
---
Well mine don‚Äôt :/
---
As someone who runs a stealth suit and works support on events, I would think you wouldn't see anything at all...
---
Personally, the first 0-50 levels is the best *without* any intentions or goals, you just roam and explore doing the missions, with an open mind learning new things.
---
Not having NPC's killed the interest for me but I got back into it just before wastelanders and haven't looked back.
---
Bloodied heavy with Dodgy, Ricochet, Emergency protocols and Cola Nut with Nuka Oranges. It's like playing full health with bloodied levels of damage. Only issue is finding someone who has thousands of .50 cal for sale.
---
So basically, why even make another Fallout game if Bethesda just half asses it? Just drop it entirely. They‚Äôve lost their touch. 
---
That‚Äôs my point. The only thing to do in this is dailies and grinding. That‚Äôs legit it. I never said it was a bug. There‚Äôs no fun to it. Barely any adventures. They need to put more effort into the story of the game and keep running off of it, and they just aren‚Äôt. They added colossal wendigo, and that seems pretty pointless and endless too. It‚Äôs just another event grind. Where‚Äôs the creativity? You can for sure find something for the common population of Fallout to do in the games without forcing them to grind for something. 
---
No, not all games do this. Bethesda is known to do this a lot with Fallout especially since Obsidian left. If they really intended for this design to work, then it was a shit design. It really is. This game had so much potential to be creative and fantastic. 
---
That wasn‚Äôt the case, as soon as they launched this game, it was bad right from the start. That killed their morale and changed the crews around and focused on different games. They gave up on this game. 
---
Those dailies you talk about is exactly what sends people away from this game. There are plenty of things I could think of that would revitalize the life in this game. SO MANY THINGS. Not just dailies and grinding the same damn quests every single day. It doesn‚Äôt feel like gaming anymore. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I enjoy the hell out of Fallout and so on. I actually do these dailies as well, but it pains me that I do. No I know I‚Äôm not required to do them, but what else is there to do for me if I didn‚Äôt wanna do dailies? They just didn‚Äôt try. At all.
---
If you are a bloodied one handed build, all you need is a 1 star bloodied deathclaw gauntlet to do serious damage. Faster Swing Speed and Strength is just an add on.
---
Brought me back
---
I believe that was the original model for the scorch beast before it was changed into a bat
---
Yeah, that's just Pam. She was just trying to be friendly. She's also the organ player at her church.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't really much Bethesda could do otherwise they would've done it by now given that there's money on the table....though that also feeds into my theory that they could even be involved in such schemes trying to sell stuff directly to the player without the controversy if they put it into the Atomicshop.
---
And getting a good amount of Nuka Orange takes Buddhist monk level of patience if you'rejust resetting the soda fountain in Whitesprings
---
yeah, the fixer. which is neither a combat rifle nor lever action rifle üòÇ which is why i asked if you were joking lmao
---
did it today !  as usual he charged straight at me and grabbed hold of my elastic waistband, ready to give me an atomic wedgie.  but yesterday i got a three star em gun with double shot, etc.  sensing where he was i wasted away half his life in seconds ... and *then* he killed me.  the whole thing lasted only a few minutes, where usually it is an all-out fluster cluck of people running in circles for many minutes with carnage and scores of robots.  when i respawned and returned to the area it was basically done
---
Sounds like youre just using a very bad build. My heavy arms build chews through everything, even when I was screwing around with a 35 basic laser mini gun.
---
Clean out your computer with compressed air, especially if you have pets in your house, or if someone smokes indoors.  Dust, hair and smoke tar can plug your heatsinks up bad.  If that's all good you probably have hardware issues.
---
As some of the other commenters have said, stick to a style in a camp. My add is that you can look to some real world buildings for inspiration\
---
\
---
For instance, I built along a railroad track and took a look at some railroad siding and track maintenance buildings/outbuildings to get a general feel for the way they looked. In the end it turned out looking organic with the terrain. You can check it out [here at imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/4he6crf).
---
The fixer uses .45 rounds and is basically a combat rifle
---
While that may entirely be wha they‚Äôre doing they should‚Äôve done the testing for things pre launching the season. Right now at this point of time these challenges give the biggest bang for your buck when playing the game and trying to do the season. With that being said if they are comparing completion rates of challenges then the variance that they will see will mostly be summed up to the increase of difficulty and people having limited amount of time to play the game. At this point everyone or atleast most everyone is doing every challenge to try and get through the season as quick as they can and if they view the differential of the 2 as a means to go with the harder one then do the cycle a few times and we have to eat 50 pieces of gum for 500 score.
---
You're doing fine.
---
I understand the point, but im 100% free market based. If it is too much for the return, dont do it. The obvious end is you dont get the points and you can keep your gum, stay your level, or play only x hours. 
---
Think of it as they are offering a contract, some are relatively out paced with others, 1gum or 3 gum. You can choose to perform the contract or not. This is your choice. They arent forcing you to, they are making the offer. 
---
If you think as you are arguing for everything to scale, I promise the least of your worries will be the point scale and would instead be turned to all the bugs that will rampantly run through the game due to the changes made. 
---
Also, just an aside, I work as a salary worker. So whether i work 20 or 60 hours a week, I get the same paycheck.
---
Thank you so much! I didn't know this
---
It takes up as much budget as the Items normally would, its simply allow you to make prefabs to put down.
---
It's pretty much necessity to go to a LFG discord to call people to your aid. I mean, with two people and the right gear you can easily hard defend, but you still need 3 additional people to run for ores if you want to easily hit that 100 ore mark.
---
So let‚Äôs say right now I don‚Äôt have anything stored. My house takes 50% budget. If i blueprint, that‚Äôs another 50% budget stored. And now I can‚Äôt build build anymore.  ?
---
Ever since the B.E.T.A!
---
Every Battle Pass has useless things in it.
---
Iv only gotten 100 ores once.
---
but normally if you have more then 5 people its pretty easy to just run the tunnels.
---
The biggest issue with the game type honestly is it‚Äôs not worth waiting for 5 minutes between lobby and loading screens to risk getting killed early. If it were a quicker process to start new games it would increase participation I feel. The delay between matches is the biggest killer of the game type and that‚Äôs unfortunate as it does have potential and it‚Äôs the most skill demanding part of the game 
---
With that being said I was a wookie for a while but started up again much more aggressive and it‚Äôs much more fun to me. I also had the luck of being part of the bug where adventure xp counted towards nw perk cards so on the level up challenges I just cash in 20 of the 150 cards I have and call it a day
---
I just did it with a friend and only 1 person showed up midway through. We didn't do too bad but here are some suggestions:
---
1. A team of 4(at least), 2 defending each side, 1 grabbing ore, and 1 healing/guarding the scavengers.(rotating jobs will be needed as it takes time for the ore to respawn for each player)
---
2. Low leveled explosive shotguns and enforcer - As long as you cripple the ghouls' legs, they can't attack anything. The npc's will continue to attack but if you cripple them on spawn, it should slow things down. As long as you don't outright slaughter the ghouls, it should essentially stop any new enemies from spawning for the most part. (If deathclaws spawn, crippling temporarily works but just remember that they WILL get back up).
---
3. I'm not entirely sure if it works but I believe running excavator PA should help with the ore since it is a bit limited.
---
If you're on PC, you could [grab this](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/655) while we wait!
---
Fix farming for legendaries then you can easily deal with dupers. If the only way to get legacy and actual viable weapons is to buy them with real cash or dupe it then guess what a large portion of the community will do? I‚Äôve played this game since the start and still can‚Äôt find bloodied 10mm pistol let alone with explosive on it.
---
That way they can go, "What? We've got so many challenges! Look at this high number!"
---
I forgive you.
---
the gold rewards were in such low amounts I'm going to permenantly have an odd number on one of my characters.
---
Just thought I'd make the suggestion but if you ever make a new character and need to do the quest again, go to a SBQ event. Plenty of people get downed there so that usually works
---
I‚Äôm on XB1. But thanks!!
---
This looks great! Thanks for the advice and sharing the pictures, I‚Äôll definitely try and find some things that inspire me like you have.
---
I was disappointed that she couldn't come to my camp and be romanced.
---
I was the same way man. I just hit level 50 also and I launched my first nuke yesterday.
---
I think they are also balancing the list of challenges as well. Today's challenges weren't that hard, so changing the number on one or two of them can make the overall list up to a level to want it to be.
---
My point stands
---
Agreed it was bad today. Laggy and the frame rates were super low.
---
Now I'm not saying you're a gold digger..
---
The sickle man looks for you!
---
But is a free market view the best view for a game that‚Äôs been struggling on the surface since it launched? Viewing it from a free market view kills the joy and feeling of satisfaction that you‚Äôre supposed to get from getting score and ultimately leveling and finishing the season. Having the score challenges rewards work as a free market can have far more harmful effects than rewarding effects. I like to think that Bethesda‚Äôs intention with the game is to not have it as such and instead give increased rewards for harder work obviously it won‚Äôt be entirely proportional increases and instead give proportionally less and less the more they add, but they‚Äôre still giving you more for doing more. 
---
As for your salary comment I clearly am aware that the amount of work you do doesn‚Äôt reflect your pay you receive which is why I explicitly said you were contracted. I think that the free market approach to things has its place in the game, but score challenges are not one of those places. Sure add it to daily‚Äôs for some side faction or something, but don‚Äôt add it to the primary means of progression of the newest content we‚Äôve seen in months.
---
*cries in Ad Victoriam*
---
I still haven't had the joy of launching a nuke yet. I think every time I log in I tell myself that is what I'm going to do but then get side tracked because I just find something interesting that pulls my attention away like clockwork.
---
Thanks for posting that.
---
I had never seen that video.
---
Exactly like what i saw [happen.It](https://happen.It) was astonishing.
---
damn thats so good to knowXD i made a whole new person ha
---
Fastest way is to just make a new character.  Level 0 to level 1 is extremely easy.  Rinse repeat.
---
I do the same for adventure mode if I'm not feeling like grinding out a level on my main.
---
I think it safe to say that whatever Bethesda thinks the community will be like, we‚Äôre always the opposite. I‚Äôm pretty sure they expected us to go into 76 in an all out free for all murdering each other with no remorse
---
ON YOUR FEET SOLDIER
---
Add me and come on over.  I‚Äôll take you out hunting. Gamertag is Crunchtastic.
---
They time out, looks like 24 hours hard from what I can tell. So either pick a commodity and get all those nodes or go ham and then skip a day.
---
Perk packs or the whitespring
---
It used to really annoy me that people said the game was terrible 
---
I used to ask people ‚Äúhad they played the game‚Äù they said ‚ÄúNo BuT I WAtchD YoUTuBe videO oN iT‚Äù 
---
It annoyed me that the bad rep the game stopped people from actually playing a fun enjoyable game, and I‚Äôm glad you enjoy it now too
---
correct
---
I'm not sure how many hours I've been playing today and finally have a stable server
---
That's not true and you know it. If you have spare atoms you won't purchase more. I play another game with a premium currency and the dev team does everything in their power to make you spend it, because they know when you run dry that's when you open the wallet.
---
The entire map would also need like twice the amount of assets, nuked versions and regular versions. This would take a lot more resources.
---
Automatic weapon, reflex sight, aligned barrel, forceful or aligned stock, and a magazine that has faster reload. This gets the vats cost per shot down to about 26-30% of the original.  Adding Vats crit damage helps as you'll be hitting a lot and building up the crit bar. Fixer&gt;handmade&gt;combat rifle&gt;assault rifle&gt;10mm&gt;pipe pifle.
---
A lever-action rifle works as well, trading heavier damage for fewer shots in Vats. Same mods as above, but no automatic, so you're at 76-80% of the original Vats cost. Grim Reaper's sprint can help the AP reset to keep it going.
---
For both guns, consider a sneak build and silencer to max your damage.
---
I believe some areas will spawn enemies according to the level of players that load in. One example would the Whitesprings golfclub. When I started a new character and would grind there, the ghouls were typically around my level. Occassionally there would be some at level 62 though. Then even when I was using a character over 62, there would be a few times I had ghouls spawning in at level 8\~30
---
I loathe their setup for questing in a group. 
---
There is no group credit when we do a story quest. Talk to X. Nope, we both have to do it. Go kill that leader. Nope, it‚Äôs an ‚Äúinstance‚Äù where I can only help you finish that quest and then we have to do it all over again for me while you help me.
---
Leveling solo is much easier than grouping. We just group up now for public events.
---
Check your stats to see if you mutated. Chameleon mutation will make you invisible if you stand still (no power armor)
---
The Giant teapot house usually has some in the scale near Sweetwater.
---
I have 10k screws total on all my characters. Google assaultron screw farming and you will never run out.
---
I don't know why anyone cares what other players spend their money on. If it's the only way to get the resource or whatever it, then yeah that sucks, but it's only a like 300 through the whole season, you can get it as well without paying, and you can get bullion much easier through normal gameplay anyway. And the game is 99% PVE, why care that people with extra money to waste is wasting it on something you can get by actually playing a game.
---
Honestly, it would be best if it was between Whitesprings &amp; Foundation. The most traffic happens there, the Wayward is generally a low level place, where not many high level players come by.
---
You can. Go to the season and hit R to rank up on PC. There should be a thing at the bottom that says the key.
---
Was 3 nukes back to back I showed up for the second but couldn't do the 3rd. Afterwards the people at the queen went and did encrypted and killed the imposter without activating the pylons. The imposter popped up and I saw its health bar go down a little before regenerating to full. Then it's health drained and died. Still trying to figure out what all was going on.
---
I have Tank Killer permanently enabled as well.I never knew this.
---
I have often wondered why damage done to her airborne is significantly different to when she is on the ground.
---
I use a Zealots explosive 50 Cal with 30% damage to Scorched on her in the Sky.
---
When she lands i use a blooded shredding Mingun which seriously shreds and obliterates her..
---
I have to pick my moments to use that thing with it being so ammo intensive.
---
You would have thought the Explosive 50 Cal with 30% extra damage would be better,yet the difference in DPS is seriously visible.I think she is immune to explosive weapons.
---
I would use a high level as it really helps in the early game
---
Build/Mutations are more important than gear.  The first new quest from wastelanders (From the Wayward) can get you a decent weapon that will last you for a while based on the build you want.  You don't even need to swap them that often unless you went out of your way leveling up to 50 to take the absolute worst picks along the way. 
---
One of my characters is a 15 CHA build that focuses on shotguns.  He only really has issues with some of the nastier robots and if he gets swarmed with ghouls.  
---
this person made a video specifically playing with non legendary gear:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSG1D9jkQsM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSG1D9jkQsM) 
---
So don't think you need to have the best, you can do fine with mediocre.  Stacking Food, Drinks, and Chems also gives you a great boost.  Pop those psycho drugs to do +25% damage, eat that glowing meat steak for +10% damage, drink that tea that gives you +1 STR.
---
shielded raider armor... that hit me right in the soul.
---
year and a half and still no plan drop :(
---
Possible, yes. You need the best armor, weapon, perk cards, food, and chems and you have to know what you're doing.
---
Happens to everyone. I'm level 160 ish and people leave and come all the time.
---
Are you playing in NW first? If so, avoid that. First complete your daily challenges in adventure, and leave the NW one until the end. Once you get out or NW, go back to adventure in that moment, you will get a NW message, finally close the game and continue playing normally tomorrow. But never go into NW before adventure if you have pending daily challenges.
---
Why would you ever want to drop one of your valuable weapons to being with?
---
I‚Äôm 65 now I think. Seems about the norm, but I‚Äôm saving up atoms so I only need to get to 90 or so and then buying the rest
---
It was definitely eye-opening that's for sure. After the time with Fallout 76 that I've had thus far, I feel like an idiot moving with the hate crowd so easily like that. I was definitely wrong on this one, and I am really glad I finally take the plunge.
---
That must be nice to be able to play with your girlfriend. I once asked my wife if she'd play with me and with the look she gave me, you'd think I asked her if I could shit on the floor.
---
not got a bloodied weapon yet apart from on a minigun so it chews through ammo like no tomorrow. I have modded it with prime mod so it uses ultracite 5mm now too and it does melt scorched at least but its out of ammo in less than an hour lol.
---
Yup that's how I do it, adventure, NW, then adventure!
---
the point OP is trying to make is that its NOT hard to do but pointlessly extended artificial "difficulty" by making it 3 instead of 1 when 1 gave the exact same amount as 3.
---
It doesn't use the budget until you place it in the world.
---
True. And every high level is going to be dry after Smily.
---
Theoretically, you can. In practice, it's probably just going to be another 1 star bloodied board, or it is if you have my luck anyway.
---
Ad victoriam!
---
Even if you stay it still remembers your location and of you join a server where it can be placed down it will place it again fully intact
---
Exactly.
---
it's hilarious, so I say leave it
---
I am just shy of 200 and yea I know the regular fast travel to camps and switching , but no joke it is as SOON as he joins a team he is booted and they leave- the team never last more than a couple minutes . Way more than I have experienced being on teams
---
Oh I did not know that. I was putting random outfits and stuff on vendor for zero caps thinking people can just 'buy' it for challenge. Thank you for informing me. I will start setting them at 1 cap.
---
My game isn't saving screenshots from picture mode. Anyone know why?
---
Weird then. This auto completion bug has never ocurred to me. Then again, I don't play very much in nw mode.
---
Thanks for the 52,865th post on this
---
Battle royale feels old for a battle royale I feel as if it‚Äôs just there for the sake of being there 
---
The main game is good though especially since the wastelanders update came out
---
i just switch my protectron in my camp to collect fasnacht treats every now and then until I get some gum.
---
I was just tryna reply to your actual thought process in the actual post, not over the entitlement thing.
---
If your vendors look good from the map menu people will come to your camp no matter where it is, if you pick wayward, flatwoods, white springs, etc you will spend lots of time loading the game looking for worlds that have your spot open.
---
Thank you!
---
I've lost 3 days worth of dailies, and a little more than half a set of weeklies, Bethesda Customer support doesn't care to the point they actively auto lock my tickets before I get a response now!
---
They can spawn at the Pumpkin House in the cauldron on the front porch. You can also sometimes find them at the Tyler County Fairgrounds (inside the building with all of the Halloween stuff is your best bet). They also sometimes spawn inside of Morgantown High School.
---
Whahahah, I will buy your 3000 rounds of 10mm and then convert it into 20 2mm by using the ammo converter...... 20 rounds at a time!
---
Only takes me 45min! Now, that's a steal!
---
Thanks for the information.
---
Then that's a problem. Never had it that, people tend to stick around for 30 minutes and leave. I'm guessing people kn Discord servers must have had an organized attack on him or they just generally discriminate low level players, which is sad :(
---
That‚Äôs how it should be, especially 17 years past that.
---
Well I sell mostly Plans marked down to get people to actually buy. So jet pack plans for like 1k. Maybe I‚Äôll make it the Ash Heap, never made a camp there before, is there any pools of water there?
---
I recommend if you can to get a gatling gun, it uses the same ammo, does more damage, but goes slower.
---
This actually happens to me all the time. I join a team as a level 23, and they‚Äôll leave immediately and create a brand new team. Usually, the same exact type of team they were just on. Sometimes I‚Äôll make my own team, and people will never join that one. Alternatively, they may join and then leave immediately after. Super weird. I‚Äôm just trying to get the inspirational bonus.
---
Most games have a three strike rule before they flat out ban people, bethesda gave all the returning dupers one warning before a full ban and even likely banned the most egregious offenders outright and people are STILL complaining that they're too soft.
---
It's fine. They made it so you get stuff you can actually use in the game + some cosmetics and atoms versus just getting atoms which only gets you cosmetics and a couple kits you don't need.
---
I prefer getting a variety of things and not just cosmetics for doing challenges. I get that you get less atoms now than before, but I'm not "gotta get all the skins" kind of guy, so it doesn't seem that bad to me.
---
But what if you really really want to get high on 'life'?
---
I'll show myself out..
---
Shotguns have potential to do tons of damage with VATS but it can be a bit inconsistent. I believe it typically needs to have 33% VATS, bash damage, or I forget the last legendary mod. Then there are some cases where you need an armor piece with "reduce damage while blocking" for the "magic" to work. 
---
High damage rifles are nice like hunting rifles or lever actions(you'll probably want to run grim reaper sprint with it of course).
---
Last would be most rifles with "reduced VATS cost by 25%". This can be incredibly useful as long as you add on an automatic receiver(-50%), swift/quick mag(-5%), aligned barrel(-5%), aligned/forceful stock(-5%), and a reflex sight(-10%). Each of these mods will reduce your AP VATS cost to essentially nothing. At this point, you can just lock on once, hold the trigger, and not worry about running out of AP.
---
Any return on this?
---
But now we are moving a whole new section. The legendary run overall increases in difficulty for every level, so would it follow that the challenges per day should also increase or decrese in difficulty day to day? Should the reward be aligned with your level on the run? Should the players that staryed the game late be given some help to "catch up"?
---
What you are being offered is based on their general atom challenges being converted straight over to score. The challenges for the most part all appear in a rotation or randomly chosen (not sure as I never concerned myself with it). Progression isnt guaranteed, and as it stands, ill finish the run with two or three weeks to spare. If you want to skip those you deem as "underpaid", then do so. It is highly likely you will still complete the run and be able to hold your head high from your soap box stating you stood up to it on your principles. 
---
To simply put it, choose what challenges you want to do, and play the game as you see fit. Calling out a disparity between score points and effort between 1 and 3 gum when ignoring the disparity between leveling up once for a 300 level character and eating 1 piece of gum is just foolish at best.
---
I like it although I do have gripes about the leveling system
---
Happy to help!
---
 I‚Äôd like to visit the plan mule! IGN: AltairIV
---
Must be a lot harder to find bloodied on pc.   Try the marketplace. Someone will sell you one.
---
Even tough I said Whitesprings &amp; Settlers, I usually take the technique that u/throwittobill described. So I guess in the end, find a location that generally suits you. For me, it's about having access to water &amp; junk, so it's always kind of a challenge.
---
I have about 5000 halloween candy and never knew I could use it for that. Thanks a bunch!
---
This. It's 10 people shooting for legendaries and 1 hero going for the ores.
---
Skipped some of the grind by doing the gleetch with the dailies
---
Create new character, play a single match of NW, go up three levels, complete the challenge.
---
Would take almost less effort then it took to post this shit.
---
There‚Äôs riverfront property on the western side near the transition to the forest area.  There‚Äôs definitely more but nothing notable springs to mind.  Take a walk around and see what you like.
---
Look at a level map. Stay in the forest until you are strong enough to leave.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ some people will complain about anything.
---
Oof good luck tho
---
Yeah. They can't use their back legs at all to push forward,so they just drag themselves slowly with their arms.
---
hey man. the caps are useful to new people like me. Can finally buy some recipes in whitespring
---
Yup, during vats, looting and walking around.  Before this month I didn‚Äôt have one crash and been playing since beta
---
Amazing
---
Welcome fella
---
I for one am grateful.
---
Also ,after killing the Queen dont ever run in immediately to loot [her](https://her.You).This is the time you are most likely to end up dead,blind sided  by a King Mirelurk Sonic attack,or other nasty surprise .
---
Soon as she dies i find a high point to jump up and wait until it is safe to go back down and loot her.
---
I hate these chew gum ones.  I'm stockpiling gum from my scavenger bot and it's kinda not okay
---
Thanks for the offer but someone else already helped me out! All this niceness really reaffirms the good in the community for me
---
Bethesda does not care
---
Love wearing that freaky toothy mask! I saw someone else wearing it with the pink suit and felt inspired. Wore it with the Roadtripper outfit for awhile.
---
And if you'd gotten a three star nocturnal +bashing reduced weight switchblade you'd have been happy with the drop and all of that spent effort, time and ammo would have been worth it?
---
Interested!
---
I server hopped four times going to three different locations today just for three packs of bubble gum this is what my life has come to
---
We need a couple things that low levels don't usually have. I need players with mutations so mine are amplified from a perk Strange in Numbers. This is even better with Herd Mentality Mutation. Along with that, some low levels get annoying and constantly in your way, sending messages, and just being a pain.
---
It's an exploit.
---
Yeah I like the less crowded areas, I really like the outer border areas of the map.  I‚Äôm also lazy and don‚Äôt like to move my camp, my spots only been occupied once!
---
Its an exploit involving blueprinting the machine
---
Just random, I had a three star unyielding chest first time, not so good on left arm, I'm still trying.
---
Let us join hands and ask that his holiness, Mothman, forgive this vault dweller.

Depends on how you want to play.
---
I have a full set of SS armour and I play a stealth rifleman build. I like to use the Ghillie suit, but it makes my character look too skinny, plus my backpack never matches.
---
Once I hit level 83, I can use the ghillie SS armour, along with the ghillie backpack to blend in
---
Lmao I have a pic of me in a red dress leaning over (stair step animation)  and a naked guy with an owl mask playing drums at one violent night we were the best band.

Server hopped for about 5 hours earlier trying to find 1 good gun and nobody was selling one apart from 1 I found who logged out just as I was about to buy. Theres been a couple more but they selling for silly prices like 25k a weapon etc..
---
I just finished up kicking ass and chewing bubblegum, now I'm all out of bubblegum!!!!
---
Ok, i added you
---
This.
---
Very informative thanks so much
---
Somebody did the exact same thing in my game except I was the only one who ran in the fire (naked) and everybody died except me!
---
I try not to one shot legendaries, but sometimes it is difficult as a stealth bloodied. It‚Äôs why I bash them. Oh and hey stackdaddy. üòä
---
With 80 legendary modules i was able to craft the whole secret service unyielding armos (some 2 stars and one 3 stars) plus 3stars bloodied gauntlet with strenght and 40%faster swing speed, i think i got lucky lol.  
---
Edit: i forgot a 2 star bloodied gaus minigun
---
They did not say they couldn‚Äôt increase stash limit due to performance. They said any future increases would need to be weighed against server performance. 
---
Those are two very different statements.
---
I don‚Äôt think the stash box should exist at all personally, but I‚Äôm probably in the minority. I agree it shouldn‚Äôt be paywalled.  Best to stick to facts though. Not a lie.
---
Level 104 here, just finally launched a nuke yesterday. Damn squirrels run rampant in the appalachia pulling your attention every time. Glad you are having fun now though.
---
Na  me and a couple of friends killed a 3 Star wendigo colossus and it dropped a 1 Star zealot leather right arm
---
I wouldn't know, really, at this point i'm in full Unyielding heavy BOS with sneak perks, and i can *literally* go up and give enemies a quick smooch on their lips while still being in caution.
---
If there is gonna be a next season they gotta make the progression faster, I'm already burnt out and only on the 2nd phase of the board. I honestly wish the S.C.O.R.E would just be 1000 and doesn't go further when ever you rank up.
---
Indeed Bethesda should ask WHY ppl dupe not just remove the dupers and move on. Banning your player base actually LOSES them money as they are potential FO1st members if not already.
---
Im just saying you were completely denying the fact that you can have a full collection without ever picking one up
---
does super duper work like that..?
---
Wow. Cheaters man
---
Thank you for this.
---
There's always a post like this once every few days that raises the point of artificial difficulty existing "just because" and a lot of people here just get real defensive and say "but it's so easy just do this event or go here! stop whining and play the game!"
---
These people always degrade the original point to nothingness and it becomes a real degenerate discussion. Bethesda won't change anything if people just blindly accept that they're making things fake difficult for no reason.
---
Stop bouncing between doing 1 to 3 legendaries or chewing gum as a daily. My personal favorite was having to kill 3 legendaries a few weeks ago, as a **weekly,** and then having it as a **daily** in the same week when it was a daily to kill **1** the day prior... Just why?
---
If they're going to make up this fake difficulty then reward more points or stick to the lowest amount possible to complete. If we're going to keep getting 250 (not on doubles weekend) for chewing 1 and 3 gum or killing 1 and 3 legendaries, what's the point?
---
I'm enjoying it. Yes, the fireworks are useless and yes, the armor skins are useless to me too because I wear outfits, but everything else I enjoy. 
---
I'm not going to complain about extra scrips, caps, or gold. I take a lot of silly pictures, so I like the costumes, poses, and frames. I change my camp around a lot, so I like the camp stuff. I didn't expect anything amazing out of the season anyway--it's not like it's extra money to have it--so I'll just have fun working towards getting the hidden fireplace door.
---
It took me about 175 legendary modules to get my unyielding armor full set.
---
I have 2 pieces that are 1 star.
---
And you get all 5 and more with 80 lol what the heck
---
Sure beats finding 9 monsters to kill in NW though (and I love NW).
---
I'm not sure. I've been running around Appalachia in my stealth suit with a scoped Fixer. I'd rather not be spotted by a Sheepsquatch...
---
It's weighted towards the shit prefixes. I've managed to get a 3 star torso, left arm, and left leg so far. 140 modules.
---
1. If such a bug exists this is not betehsda's official forum nor their customer support which is where you should be reporting it
---
2. If this bug exists there is likely nothing anyone could do to prevent it from happening to them outside avoiding any and all contact with any other player anywhere on the map so all you'd be doing here is tipping off more assholes to look into how to pull it off.
---
3. If this bug doesn't exist and you somehow dropped the gun yourself and they were returning it then all you're doing is starting a panic over nothing.
---
4. If someone figured out how to steal from peoples inventories you wouldn't have lost a single weapon and then had it happily returned to you, they would have stripped you bare and then run.
---
I feel like the cards are all sorts of fucked up right now. 
---
I always run lone wanderer and iron clad to reduce damage but all of the sudden this week I'm taking a shit ton of damage, even from low level enemies.
---
I thought it was... but sometimes, I see no gain between kills...
---
Yes they all were.
---
On the second Nuke launch i was just about to launch myself after completing the countdown.I aborted at the point of just about to enter the Key Card, and went and did the Nuke.Then went straight back and launched after we killed the Queen.
---
Good bunch of players having fun,was a nice Vibe.
---
Players Stim packing each other in the heat of battle.
---
üèÖthis is all I have to give,  but you deserve more for that reference.
---
Nope. They won't fix major game issues like perks cards until the next patch, unlike normal gaming companies that develop hotfixes for significant gameplay altering bugs as soon as possible.
---
I think it‚Äôs designed to give you the exact opposite of what you want.
---
I mean I get that- players that follow you around and are wandering could be a bit much. But I know for a fact he doesn‚Äôt do that obviously , as it‚Äôs his second character and not a noob.
---
I got a 3* bloodied Gauss shotty on my 3rd roll but I don't play bloodied, so for me, that was a fail. Someone else might have been stoked as hell, but I'm just adding it to the waiting list for the scrip machine. Randonmess plus the very specific thing you're looking for won't produce good results, generally. But yeah, 110 tries is certainly deflating and that sucks, etc.
---
Welcome Moon-And-Star.
---
Unbeknownst to you, he‚Äôs always following a short distance behind, also sneaking around with a Fixer.
---
Nope, not until the next patch. You're wasting 5 perk points if you're using it maxed out currently
---
Don't rush into using the skin so fast.
---
[SS Ghillie skin](https://youtu.be/Dt_5l9U4uhc)
---
Omg u got unlucky xd rng sucks ngl, think i used all the luck i had there haha.
---
Just inside the door at clarksburg hardware store is a guaranteed spawn for bubblegum
---
I swapped it out cuz it was too inconsistent.
---
They're not dying. They're swooning from romantic shock.
---
Sandman.  The pvp killer.  The General of the Enclave.
---
Yea it really does seem like it‚Äôs a stigma for lower level players.
---
The power armor skins are nice and i definitely like the atoms as rewards but everything else was meh.
---
Any one of them - not all of them Silly Goose! LUL
---
Sandman isn‚Äôt about info.   I enjoyed his earlier vids.  I‚Äôm gonna check out the new stuff.
---
I got so many mutant's armor in the process.
---
Out of the 110 rolls, I got one impressive bolstering piece left leg. Reduced weapon weight and action points.
---
Should we tell him guys
---
Unfortunately, I know...
---
Maybe it depends on the level of player you're trying to attract. Newer players will be around the wayward while higher level will be going to foundation and crater everyday. It just depends on what you have to offer. That being said, if you have a good amount of stuff in your vendor, most people will go there regardless of location.
---
you've all heard of the stalking mothman - now get ready for the stalking sheepsquatch. he's baaaa-d to the bone.
---
Fml.
---
You wonder how any of this shit gets past them.
---
I mean the back looks terrible but hopefully it will be eradicated with the backpack skin on.
---
Also, the first person thing is probably just from heavy weapons. Some PA does it too but rifles normally okay.
---
Regardless that is ridiculous lmao
---
I enjoy it. I may not use everything but others do. I do wish they‚Äôd done a dark matter armor skin instead of the ugly grass one, but at least we can earn the rewards. No one is going to like everything, but what you may dislike, others may enjoy.
---
By googling the codes ü§î
---
And don‚Äôt get me started on the legendary purveyor.
---
I payed $60 to save myself hours of grinding score.  I‚Äôm level 94 on the board now.  Haven‚Äôt even looked at the challenges for days.
---
I agree I thought it would physically change things. Land shape trees gone etc. I'm not disappointed with the actual result but I really thought there's be more terrain forming from it
---
I solo'd it today to. then went back to camp and realized my cards were all set for crafting not for dps. feels bad.
---
Honestly, I don't know how I feel about the gauss weapons.
---
They sound weird to me and I keep missing at 95% vats chance often.
---
Oh. And I blow myself up to smitherines.
---
I love it when we complain about things we got for free.
---
Bro I didn‚Äôt even get told I got SHOWN lmao
---
It made it about 100x worse...
---
At popular vendors I've seen lines form. It's beautiful when it works right. People shouldn't be AFK in front of a vendor anyway. (But I've seen it happen too). 
---
I watch for a sec and see what other people are doing. Like if someone is on the first vendor I'll go to the 4th one. I try not to mess up other people's flow and try not to mess up mine. If someone is standing at the same vendor for awhile, I'll usually wait my turn. It just feels like the right thing to do idk. 
---
It's like standing in line at the grocery store for 20 minutes then another register opens up and people who *just* got in your line go to that register.
---
Well, they aren‚Äôt *all* dead
---
That's realistic
---
I am quitting the legendary modules and going back to the purrrrrrveyor.
---
Playing without marsupial.. i don't remember what that is like. I even keep expecting it and getting disappointed at the lack of it in other games.
---
Apparently a bunch of people rolled bloodied explosive handmades.
---
Nukacrypt.com
---
Sure will.
---
There are usually a LOT of CAMPS by the Wayward, so you might have to hop a lot of servers. If you plan to sell cheap/beginner stuff, you could always move your camp down the river a bit closer to Flatwood. I had mine there for a time. The downside/upside is that you'll set off the Fertile Soil event all the time.
---
Yes, SCORE achievements are account wide, although rewards can go to a specific character if you get them.
---
Edit: Stuff like scrip, fireworks, repair kits...
---
I couldn't help myself!
---
They intentionally gave underwhelming rewards overall to push us to buy atoms and use the Atomic Shop.
---
https://discord.gg/mXwYa4
---
I don't know about you but I enjoy being a ghost in game. Things just die faster that way. IMO, there's no such thing as too much stealth üòÅ
---
More seriously, here's what works for me:
---
a very highy Agility, thanks to Unyielding armor, modded to be ultra-light. Perks: Sneak, Escape Artist, Light Footed. Suppressed weapons. Several mutations boost stealth. Chems and foods also. I don't use Chameleon armor at all. It is not needed in PvE. The Chinese Stealth Armor works extremely well too, especially for PvP scenarios.
---
Pretty sure Luck, and Luck related perks, don‚Äôt effect the legendary module creation method. You‚Äôll only ever get a double from the Super card, not improved results.
---
Luck isn‚Äôt a measure of how good the stuff you pick up will be, but other factors of the game. The only things you can effect in the creation process is the durability &amp; the materials used to construct it, minus the modules themselves.
---
Would love for someone to prove me wrong though, as I‚Äôve always wanted the luck to be an actual representation of looting rarity chance in game. Alas.
---
If only...*gasp* they were optional.
---
This sucks more than anything else I have seen. At least server disconnect, especially with a team, you join right back with everything still built.
---
Does it take into account that level 100 is quite a lot harder to get than level 2?  Or is it 1 level per X amount of time?
---
They're 2 quite different rates.
---
That's funny, I haven't bought any atoms, ever.
---
I heard if you chant the mantra Todd give me unyielding 3 times you will get it.
---
Not being serious lol
---
What a stupid take.
---
Thanks, I can sleep easier now.
---
Thank!
---
Imagine this event but in complete darkness how cool and chaotic would that be. Just tons of glowing green ghouls and flashlights and muzzle flashes as the only light sources.
---
Yes
---
No, not really.
---
I put all my plans at 20 caps or less. Even if they are worth 3000. Like to help the new players get plans by making them affordable.
---
*sigh* Oh God, now you really to deserve to bump into one!
---
They are one rung above NW ones, I'll give you that.  Challenges could really use work.  I think most of them are indicative of how little there is to do between the extremes of mundane crafting/gathering and endgame.  I wish they were things people actually wanted to do instead of things that are easy, but ask you to go out of your way.
---
If people are looking for plans, they'll come find you if you have lots of plans.
---
If you're selling low level and inexpensive things, go where they'll be able to get to you cheap (close to lower level zones, or even near vault 76).  If not, it's not terribly important where you go, as long as it's not the farthest corners.
---
I sell mostly expensive items, so people that are penny pinching travel costs are not my main customer.
---
FYI - 1K for jet packs is way hight.
---
Thanks for the info. I just confirmed it with two people I was playing with tonight. A rank 54 needing 2350 to get to 55, and a rank 57 needing 2425 to get to rank 58. Both confirm that an extra 25 snuck in somehow. My record-keeping suggests that it's on rank 52; it requires 2300 to get to 53 instead of 2275.
---
This also means that it requires 221,475 SCORE to finish instead of 220,275; an additional 1200 total. Unless they sneak in some more SCORE.
---
How has this moved to anything new? The leveling process gets more and more difficult, but I‚Äôm not sitting here saying that I should get more XP for killing something solely because I‚Äôm a higher level. What I‚Äôm trying to show and argue is that their taking a very boring approach to extend the playtime of their users instead of adding genuinely good and fun content to the game. If this wasn‚Äôt the first new piece of content that we had seen since WL then maybe i would just ignore this issue all together, but that‚Äôs not the case. Bethesda needs to come up with better ways of keeping the attention of its players. The same thing can be said about their grind for reputation and their grind for gold. I‚Äôm all three systems they set it up so their is some means of extending the players time playing by making them do stupid pointless tasks.
---
And while yes you can complete the season and still
---
Skip several dailies I know my life at this point of time has things pop up out of the blue which require my attention and that means maybe I can‚Äôt play for a few days so me intentionally skipping out on a challenge because I don‚Äôt agree on how bethesda has a consistency issue seems rash. 
---
Lastly when did I ‚Äúignore the disparity between leveling up once for a 300 level character and eating 1 piece of gum‚Äù? I made a point of acknowledging that one is clearly much harder than the other, however I made the point that we have not seen consistently issues with the leveling up challenge. It‚Äôs been 1 level up for 250 or 500 rn, but the gum one has been 1 piece for 250 and it‚Äôs been 3 pieces for 250. Do I think that the level up one should reward more score than the gum one? Absolutely, but since at the bare minimum they have consistency issues with it I have ground to complain about it. If they were to make a challenge tomorrow saying 2 level ups for 500 score by all means I‚Äôd complain about that too because they already set the standard of 1:250 and now it‚Äôs 2:250. You can keep arguing with me about how It‚Äôs not hard so I shouldn‚Äôt complain, but if you look through the comments clearly I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way about the topic and clearly I‚Äôm not the only one who wants bethesda to change the inconsistency and give more rewards for more work.
---
In truth, I have no idea.
---
This is the fallout superstition that luck and super super actually do something.
---
But spending 5500 scrip for 1 unyielding piece is pretty brutal.
---
My alt had played NW before (level 20 something), I use my main to get a easy NW level up achievement (currently level 3). Sleep well.
---
Also Encryptid has the highest death ratio among all the quests.
---
Okay?
---
I'm on a similar boat here, only time I leave my tin suit is when I need to craft ammo etc.
---
I really haven't even been trying to do the run and just playing the game and quests..... I'm one position away from clearing the first 3rd of the board. Doesn't seem that bad when you ignore it's there, but I get the frustration for those trying to do the run on purpose.
---
Hmm. Nothing feels broken or over kill?
---
Hunting rifles are your best friend.
---
Quite frankly, I have plenty of guns I like much better than the Gauss and I don't plan on using any more scrip on them for now. I've never blown myself up with it though, so I've got that going for me üòÇ I have seen a lot of posts about VATS missing shots (not sure if specific to Gauss or just in general), so maybe this is a broader issue that the devs are or will address?
---
Just my way of disagreeing with your opinion. I welcome any new content, new goals, especially if they are free.
---
Must be nice. Best things I‚Äôve ever gotten were a mutants‚Äô explosive fixer and an executioners swing speed bear arm.
---
ha ha I've done that with the Queen too many times to count lol
---
I'm at level 92 and it takes 3300 score to gain the next level.
---
Thanks
---
Dude... that‚Äôs 1 and 1/4 days work. It‚Äôs literally enough to get a single weapon MOD plan. Stop complaining about nothing
---
Perfect, and ty. Here is a cute pic of my cat as payment. Night

Ok thanks

I'm sure he'll find me eventually if I [keep donning the head](https://ibb.co/mqYPLkG) of one of his slain brethren.
---
Depends on what you mean by good and what you would pay. 
---
Some people do price their stuff way too high.
---
I think your process stand as a testament that that rumour is all porkies and whispers. I remember being a kid and being told that in the Lara Croft game on the PS1, that if you backflipped into the pool in her mansion, her top would come of. Of course, as a blossoming lad I made it my mission to make that happen. Days later, I accepted that my pursuit for triangular nudity was probably a lie, after a few thousand attempts.
---
The fact that i use 2 buttons to take down every enemy in barely seconds, yes, but i've played like this for well over a year now and i've recently changed my build to a full health heavy gunner. I have fun in the game again.
---
Wait how are you getting an additional 1200 score? Shouldn‚Äôt it only be 25 more than originally calculated?
---
Haha!  I win.  Took 185 left legs to get an unyielding one.  As many as the rest of the set combined.
---
I think it‚Äôs fine. No more of the bs where the people at the top hoard all the good shit and people at the bottom can‚Äôt even trade their way up with decent weapons. It actually makes you work for the guns/armor, not just trade off something you‚Äôll never use
---
Uh... That sounds like a visual bug
---
Maybe try taking it off and on, relog, etc
---
Yea, isn't it great that instead of all the free atoms we were getting we now get a bunch of junk!
---
Luck and super duper don‚Äôt affect it at all
---
It's called magic weapons, even you can get them. There is some table on google that if you have the specific legendary bonus on the weapon it will melt the sbq.  
---
(There are some OP hacked weapons too, but only handful of them, most of the hacked weapons is shite).
---
Yeah imagine having your base in that cave with the acid extractor and you fast travel back home to have a dead sbq in that cave! Defo me
---
No it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs completely random
---
‚ÄòNeighbourhood Squatch needs your help finding this vicious skin stealer.‚Äô
---
Leveling system needs a rework. Increasing by 25 every time is crazy
---
There's always exploit mate. Just gonna stay true and enjoy the game
---
Yes with bullion. Not sure the cost. 350 maybe.
---
I will do quest for Caps. Kill protestors. Desecration to a great number of corpses. Feed small animals grenades. Smash scavengers in the face for exp. Dance on the skeletons.  Throw grenades into the broom closet and shut the door on my wife. I don't think I do this stuff for Caps but, murder hobo reasons. My shack is so basic, I think it's technically a wood shed with a bed. It'd be nice if you could go further into corruption than some mild harassing of members that turn coat.
---
*Finishes tank 91*
---
awwwww yeah! What my reward?
---
*Bethesda* 100 bullion! The same amount as doing all your dailies!
---
Do they not know how fucking demoralising that will be?
---
The wolf pack event in the forest has three legendary enemies. If you want higher level enemies go through west tek then the satalite place north up the road. Then fast travel to the generals steak house. I almost always find the three legendaries in one run.
---
I have blown myself up 5 times with the gauss shotgun and I frankly don't even like the weapon.
---
I feel 2000 gold is far too much 
---
Maybe 1000 at most
---
Or whatever the special currency is next season it might be different
---
I do get some good stuff from time to time although rarely
---
I prefer to team up with level 50+ as my build slightly relies on strange in numbers and a level 14 wouldn‚Äôt have a mutation on. It is nothing personal but it is something which i actively avoid. I enjoy helping new players just depends what i am planning on doing on the day
---
I'll do you one better. Why do people make another team when there is already the same kind that's not full, so there are 2 teams with 2 people?
---
If I played on xbox, I'd be all over that. I'm on PC though. I might play on xbox eventually though, I still have a character from the beta test but ended up buying it for PC during a ridiculous sale
---
Ouf 185. Brutal
---
ewe'll never catch me alive: I'll just keep pulling the wool over your eyes with my escape artist shenanigans.
---
You have ruined the behemoth orgy!
---
This is the only time I have seen this. Is it true? I'm just curious because if that's the case I need to go find some Grape Mentats for my wife before the quest starts.
---
Thats amazingly hilarious. What a find soo many of em too..
---
If I join an events team (level 189 here), I tend to focus on any event but it also depends on what levels the rest of my team are. If I'm with lower levels (under 50) then I'm far less likely to go to an event like Scorched Earth so that they can join in too. Or if they want to join, I'll help them out and revive them when need be since thats kinda my job as a medic.
---
I second this location. I set up my first permanent camp on the cliffs between these two. My first time vending anything and i sold out of everything worth buying within like 3 days. Ive never really recovered and now my stock is pretty lackluster.

Players: WATTT SO MANY POINTS
---
Why does your daily exp repeatable challenge come up Everytime you get exp for a kill? 
---
Mine only comes up when it hits 10k
---
&gt; I wasn't able to find anything in game.
---
It's explained via terminal entries and notes. It's pretty complicated though, so as others have said, just look up the codes online.
---
I don't feel it's an actual exploit, because you can just come to the machine and blueprint it. Instead, it is purely Bethesda DEVS **negligence**. Sorry not sorry
---
Stay blessed
---
I play mainly in 3rd Person so it matters a lot.
---
Around how much exp does it give?
---
I had just started playing FO76 this past Fasnacht so I don't know if this an old issue that has been fixed or if it's related. I was setting up prices in my vending machine. In the middle of setting up an item cost for 2000 caps, this guy comes up behind me. I saw the numbers for the item quickly roll back all the way back to zero while I was in the pricing menu! I was able to fix the price and then I server hopped. Now I don't touch my machines unless no one is at my camp. :(
---
When throwing a mollie in the center, around 3-8k XP (it can vary a lot)
---
Whatever your command is to enter build mode from anywhere in your CAMP/workshop.
---
I think you can find a BOS initiate on top of the library, even before the BOS comes
---
Man I've used them several times but never saw the effect because I failed to look up in time because I was watching where they dropped.
---
It's times like this I wish I could trade bullion plan items with people who know the same plans: my very first gauss shotgun roll was a bloodied but I'm not specced for it. All I want is a medic's, darnit (my anti-armor / vats one does just fine though)
---
I have the challenge tracked. So everytime i gain a point of xp, it updates and shows my progress. You can do this by going to challenges, weekly, and then hit "Track" on it. It should show what button it is do so at the bottom of the screen.
---
Agree should have a chance to spawn muties again , and they need more random reinforcements / once an mutie area is cleared nothing beats  a 3star boss and wrecking crew ambushing you
---
Its not too much in my opinion since we can make 1700 in a week.
---
2k its basically an extra week for 2 months of SCORE grind , i think its pretty ok
---
Its easy to decode. You just need the full pass code from Whitesprings, all 8 Silo Pieces, and a simple Cypher. Too long to explain.
---
Super Duper does not work with SS armor.
---
whatever it takes to get you through the day..
---
Awesome thanks
---
I have a 'magic' ultracite gatling laser that does this. Just for a laugh I primed it too.
---
And yeah, it melts her in just a few seconds, (provided she lands). And I'm not even spec'd into heavy guns.
---
Crazy bug that kills everything around you. Been happening to me a lot recently.
---
Same to you
---
Its not complicated, pretty easy, only hard part is unscrambling the world but when you do that then its really easy.
---
Dang thats alot
---
It works on pretty much everything but i found it doesnt work for me with nukashine or any endgame items (Gauss minigun, secret service armor .etc)
---
Yeah i was just farming legendaries. I think 3 of them were legendary.
---
I'm torn on whether we should be afforded the chance to just buy them with atoms in the future or if they should be exclusive to those who put in the work. Or if they should be made exceedingly rare drops from end game encounters.
---
Shielded plan is 200 bullion, and the underarmor itself is 250. Also, you don't need to buy the lower tier linings first.
---
bye
---
Incorrect. Super Duper does not work with SS armor. Also, the game treats all armor affixes as equal and therefore cannot tell which one is "better".
---
It is broken, i am level 182 and i can level up a few times from the event
---
Thats amazing!
---
A bloodied mini gauss primed with ultracite ammo works pretty well too. Add on psychotats and big guns bobbleheads and you can do some pretty good damage.  Very expensive ammo wise tho, tough to use frequently.
---
As the saying goes, you can please some of the people some of the time,but not all of the people all of the time.
---
I have had my moneys worth out of this game ten fold.
---
And i am still enjoying it.
---
I am looking forward to the next Fallout Game.
---
I got 3 stars on all my limbs and strength on 3/5 of them. I guess I got lucky. Just not lucky enough to get acrobatics legs.
---
O.o
---
Fuck, I got like 8.  Only 1 weightless though and I am hoping for a better roll after about 50.
---
Maybe level has something to do with it? I dunno. I kinda remember going to "help" killing her around level 10 (I was doing maybe 5 damage in total per shot with a shotgun lol) and didn't get anything really worth a damn. I remember thinking "oh, this must be like killing legendaries in fo4 where sometimes they only drop trash" and decided it wasn't worth it to go to a high level area, load up on a ton of level 50 crap until I can't hardly move, then die a bunch as I try to find a place to scrap it all.  
---
  
---
Though I do appreciate having done that *now* since I'm finding at 49 I'm getting weapons I've never seen in lower levels that I have the ability to craft a lot of mods for, so it must've been from the SBQ at level 10 and defending fort defiance at 12.
---
I‚Äôm pretty darn sure it has for me in the past. Though I only made the armour very early on in the process. It seems as though it still plays the animation and shows the symbol sometimes when it activates for the SS Armor, but a duplicate isn‚Äôt made. Maybe they changed it around and forgot to sweep up the mess?
---
Fast travel away for like 10-30 mins, leave and rejoin should fix it but don‚Äôt leave too long as it would close the server and when you rejoin it would reset everything
---
just buy one month to see if you like it. if you dont use the private world or scrap box much, and can live without the monthly atoms, then cancel it. you'll keep all cosmetics unlocked, including the emotes.
---
Robot is pretty similar to combat I think but don‚Äôt quote me on that
---
This is pretty much within the range of what you'd expect, given how shitty the RNG system is in this game. It's also why I duped as many legendary modules as my stash could hold when the vendor dupe glitch was in. Screw dropping thousands of scrip on this nonsense. This is associate level game designer trash, and I won't stand for it.
---
I highly recommend checking player camps for plans. I've found so many expenses plans for 100 or so caps from players.
---
Of course.. perk + high rate of fire.. math speaks for itself
---
Yep, happened to me yesterday. It's a very common bug here on the subreddit, Bethesda is still working on a fix
---
Where is that under?
---
Ran into a no-star Legendary Wendigo a week or two ago, so it's not just you.
---
Wow
---
They're giving perk card packs to beef us up with extra cards to prep for the new legendary perk system.
---
yes, fairly common bug. and at the risk of sounding rude, you should have looked around the sub a bit as there are many posts about this.
---
&gt;Maybe they changed it around and forgot to sweep up the mess?
---
Wouldn't surprise me at all.
---
Nice!
---
Being free doesn't invalidate criticism.
---
You have to apply it in the atomic shop, restart the game, then move your camp to a new location (or just spend the 40 caps and replace your camp in the same spot, blueprinting the camp and replacing it
---
You can‚Äôt anymore, unless the glitch comes back. The way it worked, when you put items in a display and then deleted the display, you would get double the amount of whatever you put in your display. The very old dupe that is probably the one used for the junk involved the flare storage box on the camp artillery gun. It worked the same way. Put stuff in it and then delete the artillery gun. Even though you can‚Äôt put more than 800 pounds in your stash box when you move things from your inventory, the mechanic that moves items to your stash when you scrap camp items circumvents that.
---
Actually I chose near Atlas place since that‚Äôs coming up soon!
---
Not much you can do solo, but if you have a friend on the private server you can get them to respawn. One of you needs to leave the server from the nuke zone (best if the person who‚Äôs running the private server leaves). When you come back in, all of those wonderful glowing ghouls wake up. Can repeat again and again.
---
I am up to 50 modules for a bloody Gauss.
---
Most likely it will come in a random drop.
---
Where is this location? For research purposes
---
Cheers. I don't own that Collectron, so I've been getting mine from the Pumpkin House, Morgantown High School, and the Halloween-themed shed close to the Tyler County fairgrounds!
---
Certain weapons can do more damage than they ‚Äòshould‚Äô. I only use it when the event is about to fail.
---
It's not really an exploit... You don't do anything glitchy or lag related. You just blueprint it... Knowing the fusion core generators can't be done this way, blueprinting and placing those may be considered an exploit, because some janky stuff is likely involved.
---
It's a exploit with shotguns in vats, each pellet will do the full damage number on the card.
---
Im pretty sure it's the general's stakehouse at cranberry bog.
---
Basically get all codes. Use keyword
---
Cypher from bunker to remove letters from the alphabet and or the keyword at the beginning. Assign number 1-26 for your new alphabet. Use nuclear key codes to identify letters in your new alphabet. Unscramble the word. Convert back to numbers and boom! Done. 
---
Or cheat and look it up as others have suggested.
---
I don't have any spare plans, but I'd happily craft and modify one for you!
---
Luck
---
A level 14- probably not- but a level 30 or even 25 very well could- they are cheap.
---
Power patcher is not needed. Pa breaks super slow anyway. Switch it to stabilzed. Serendipity dose not work in pa

---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running this build for 200 or so levels now
---
Arrow accross, and there's a floorless copy you can put over the farmable foundation. Enjoy!
---
I've seen plenty of good weapons... But this doesn't kill the SBQ under a second as soon as she lands though...
---
It‚Äôs a free buff so why leave? Not the same type they were after? I don‚Äôt get it either but people keep joining and leaving as if they can get xp for doing it.
---
Honestly never look on the sub at all, just knew theres a big fo76 following on here and figured to ask
---
I sell all my plans for 5 caps, no matter what they are.
---
But rather unusual and not fun.
---
I think I actually cursed myself. After I posted that comment, it started happening. I killed SBQ and got 2 legendaries, both 1 star. Then I solo'd a 2 star gutsy between watoga and abandoned bog doing mayor for a day and got an anti-armor gauss rifle. Can't wait to find some more gauss rifles to scrap for mods though since I'm rearranging my stupid high luck character into a rifleman build since I already have high perception and decent agility. I really should've read some guides on fo76 before playing, because I tried to apply too much fo4 logic to my build, prioritizing luck for crit and RNG, perception for VATS accuracy then agility for AP with endurance and agility being dump stats for carry weight and lower AP cost for sprint. Had I known that 76 doesn't *really* work that way and that stats play a much smaller role to perks than they do in fo4, I'd have built much differently. But at least it's still salvageable and I'm about to hit 50 in a few quests/events so I can "fix" my S.P.E.C.I.A.L. going forward, moving some of my luck to agility and strength then pick up more crafting perk cards and heavy gun perk cards to give myself some versatility if I decide to use more power armor.
---
Will the Purveyor give out SS Armour when the plans are known ?
---
Also would this apply to a Gauss Shotgun if plans are known ?
---
If "yes" on both counts i might join you..
---
Might as well just take my chances with 100 scrip a go,instead of keep grinding for resources plus 100 Scrip on modules.
---
Cheers.
---
Level 167 here - never launched a nuke, haven't progressed far enough to be able to üòÖ too busy picking up every piece of garbage I come across and I love it. Congrats on level 50, glad you gave the game a chance
---
I would like to know the location of this cave.
---
If you get a chance, try an auto Railway Rifle. It pretty much ONLY works in VATS, lol. I use a BE Railway Rifle and she destroy enemies.
---
Interesting... That's likely what's going on... good info... thanks!
---
 I'm happy with it, compared to getting tons of atoms alone that I spent very infrequently.   I walked into the season with 10-11K atoms.   
---
The scrap and repair kits are useful, as are the lunchboxes, gb and caps.  The perk card packages will be useful when the legendary perk cards come out.   The ammo machine, cage tree and chicken coup are fantastic.    
---
Before this, the atoms were only useful in terms of scrap and repair kits.   The challenges now are giving me much better stuff.  However, I do agree with some other posters that the progression needs to be faster.   I'm feeling burned out also.
---
Can confirm
---
Plus a daily on a weekend is different than a daily during the week, at least for me. Most times during the week I don't have time to do all the dailies, especially the NW ones. Weekends I have more time and can usually do them all. It's not like they are hard, just time consuming, and I have more time to be consumed on weekends.
---
Oh, well never mind my suggestion, then! I actually will buy the pack, thanks!
---
That isn't how math works. 
---
A=B doesn't mean B=A
---
I have no idea.
---
The RNG is ridiculous.
---
Yeah true true, it is more rarer to see players in that level range but most people save mutations until they get the starched genes perk
---
Dude yes
---
Do you have hard bargain? Rank 3 of that can knock serum prices down to roughly 18k. Makes it more affordable.
---
I know right? I hate her 95% of the time tbh. I cringe when she says ‚Äúfriends‚Äù like every other sentence. But I like the music so it‚Äôs whatever. But also, I hate her.
---
I do it with or without others, focus on killing ghouls until there‚Äôs three minutes left, i go grab ores to make it to level 1 reward. No ores = fail, no reason for that when you can get a win.
---
Thanks, I appreciate the offer but I have the means to make more. I'd just wanted to know if it's a regular thing and how to correct it.
---
[here is a video about it](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Us9QrQUXfoA)
---
Hmm... Good to know... I have surveyed the crowd many times when this happens and didn't see any gun outta the ordinary... This explains it...
---
The worst hacked weapon I've seen yet is a 50 cal that shoots as fast as a minigun with the beam splitter mod from laser weapons. It's... just... broken...
---
Did you lost it in West Tek by any chance &gt;.&lt;
---
You want berry mentats, they give the INT boost. Grape is a CHA boost for better sale prices. Throughout the quest there are INT based options, mentats will help a lot
---
This VV
---
All my best weapons have come from random Ghoul drops at Whitespring back in the day.
---
3 star bosses drop junk.
---
The RNG isn't off, it's the odds that are killing you. 
---
There are 18 armor prefixes, 11 major modifers, and 13 minor modifers. That equals 2574 different possible rolls. Out of that, there is  only 143 possible "Unyielding" rolls.
---
I would like it. I supply the ressource.
---
Add XelaTheBronyGamer
---
way better than just atoms. perk cards will be quite usefull in september I guess. The best part for me is the possibility to reclaim ur rewards whenever u need them (caps, scrips, gold etc). I dont care about skins but a lot of players use them and they look happy. 
---
\- We all know about the atom situation. 
---
whats up with atom situation?
---
Kinda thirsty now.
---
they‚Äôre free
---
you get one every perk pack you open =0
---
Unsettling isn't how I'd describe it.
---
I'll be online tomorrow! :)
---
For a long time I had a Bloodied 10 MM SMG in my inventory that I never used, until about 3 weeks ago, it's become my weapon of choice. It does pretty good in VATS, but I've also got all of the commando perks filled out. 
---
Some of the weapons with VATS hit chances might be something you should look for, as well as filling out the perks of whatever your chosen weapon might be.
---
This is true, but it's just a function of what a battle pass is. There need to be a lot of "empty" levels if there are going to be 100 of them in total.
---
Additionally, some of the things you write off do have value to players other than you. Some people really like setting off fireworks with friends around, some people like the Ghillie skins (which do have a tiny mechanical benefit - when applied, they prevent you from selling or scripping your armor). 
---
For new players (or new characters) the caps come in very high amounts, facilitating fast travel or a boost to help acquire that expensive plan. Also for new players the perk card packs are helpful. Even ignoring the upcoming legendary perks, it can be real nice to open a perk you were thinking of spending a point on.
---
I feel pretty meh about the power armor paints and the fireworks, not to mention the tiny chunks of gold, but I accept those are targeted at players who just play differently from me.
---
Tyler county fairgrounds has a spawn for them in the trick or treat house. They are in a pumpkin on the table. Also, one of the vendors sells bubblegum at the whitesprings resort.
---
At the expense of atoms...
---
Kk
---
Try the pumpkin house, in the plastic pumpkin inside the house.
---
Yeah iwas struggling then I realized I had like 50 levels banked
---
This shit is all free and I'm still not getting my money's worth.
---
People who wear this aren't gonna be prepared for your succ
---
Thanks, I'll check that out.
---
We get far fewer atoms to get items we actually want.
---
So simple, other games have this. I find myself saying ‚Äúother games have/do this‚Äù so much when playing fo76 idk why i even still play it when they don‚Äôt listen to their players until it‚Äôs a giant unanimous uproar like the ammo converter.
---
No they are bad
---
Interesting.
---
What are the chances then of getting an unyielding piece?
---
... Even better.
---
Believe it or not, this is a Skyrim bug. If you were engaging a dragon and go into the city, the dragon will follow you into the instanced city.
---
It is irritating.
---
I ended up with 3 x 12 lb Heavy Armour Chest Pieces from Queen Fights.
---
I was tempted to just dump them all at a Station.
---
I had one of those that was not explosive before and I just felt like it had the worst recoil of anything, even in VATS.
---
Scrap kits are essentially useless with a tent. My point on scrip, gb, and caps remain. Plus you're already able to get them in the game, they're not new items. I have over 200 improved repair kits from the SBQ
---
How is any of this for free? The whole season model is clearly to incentivize you to spend money. Just because you don't strictly have to doesn't mean the whole system isn't garbo. Players have been supporting this game with atom purchases and 1st memberships for a good long while now. None of this is *for free.* It's the least amount of effort they could have expended to get some people to spend more money.
---
Well the nuke kills everything so you have to wait for their respawn and whitesprings had been nerfed so many times
---
The ammo machine was one of the biggest let downs out of this whole season. You'd have to stretch very far to call it 'fantastic.'
---
fallout 3, 4, and new vegas, did the same
---
The run hasn't been horrible so far, and the xp/double challenge events have helped,  but--yeah, I'm about at the point of burnout. If they start the next season immediately after this one is finished, I'll have to seriously reconsider whether it's worth it. I'm thinking that, for me, it won't be. I just don't want to feel forced to play every day.  (I know no one is *forced* to play--but the system is such that if you want all/most of the items you do pretty much have to play daily.)
---
It's one of the cards that you only need one rank of! :)
---
It's fantastic to me that I can convert all those .38, .44 and stupid arrows even if I have to push A too many times.  Before, they were just thrown on the ground.
---
Are you sure that's the only way to progress and get the armor? And you are totally correct, it's Berry Mentats I would need.
---
Ive duped materials in the past, just so I didnt have to worry about rebuilding my camp everytime someone nuked whitesprings while I was farming events. As far as weapons though, never duped them, only ever traded or bought from player vendors.
---
Yea, I never used to keep them. Now, at lvl 257 they don't come that often. J/S
---
That doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
You actually need to get your char to level 3 to complete the challenge.
---
Oh. Oh no.
---
The future tech paint does it.
---
I mostly sell chems since I'm rping as a doctor. Formula P is something of a best seller for me. Cheap for me to make (chemist + super duper + green thumb can yield about 40 for me just from a single trip to Lewisburg and Arktos) but as it's a rare plan drop from Project Paradise, I can afford to sell it at roughly 100 caps each. 
---
Otherwise, ammo: 5.56, .308, fusion cores, plasma cores, .45. Occasionally if I get a fixer roll (I don't use them but I got the plan drop a while back) that's decentish that gets snapped up. I sold a ghoul slayer's one that and the only reason it didn't get scripped was because it was explosive. 
---
"Above all, do no harm" kinda went out the window there....
---
The only thing that I thought was really neat is the lightning bug lamp. 
---
However that‚Äôs pushing a nostalgia/memories of a loved one who passed on thing. (I buy way too many frog and lightning bug things.)
---
If you want it for free, yes. All the other dialogue options lead to the suit being destroyed and needing to buy plans from Smiley.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten to that jet pack but I posted the other day that I bought moth man bundle from item shop and that jet pack is greyed out for me. Idk what to do I have everything also
---
Super Duper gave me worse luck, I remember getting a 3* then next I would get a 1* with the same primary effect like 3 times in a row. Each time that was after Super Duper seemed to trigger. So that might be the source of your bad luck, I didnt test it a ton since I didnt want to waste Legendary Modules lol
---
I sort of love Seasons. I used to mostly just scav, collect and sell things on my own. Now I have a handful of friends; I am not scared of going to help kill the queen anymore; I actively seek out scorchbeasts to kill; West tec is so simple I don't know why I wasn't always doing it; I am drowning in legendaries and have lots to just give away to new friends; and I can potentially see myself spending time in NW since I've had to try it. This has shown me a whole new side to the game, whereas before, after a year and a half, I thought the game was coming to an end for me. I don't love having to play every single day, but playing every day has reduced my all day weekend habits and I am enjoying that time doing other things.
---
Be careful if building too close to the observatory, you might be required to move your camp when the BoS update drops. (Like what happened to people who built close to the crashed space station before Wastelanders.)
---
More like miner, 69'er, amirite?
---
&gt; that's the packtray difference [tm]
---
Right up there with Cistipig and saltuna. 
---
Goofing aside, thank you!
---
There would be 1:18 chance which works out to 5.26% probability.
---
Do they care about me? Nah, probably not, fair enough. But as with many other things, don‚Äôt get anything if you don‚Äôt ask, and if it effects enough people and gets enough bad press, they will care, because they do care about keeping enough of their customers happy enough to keep playing. And the only way we‚Äôll get to that point is if people speak up.
---
That's cool, but my post is about the rewards
---
I just took over the workshop next to my camp as a score challenge, and the defend event was against 3 lvl 80 scorchbeasts and the mobs to follow.. it's usually mole rats
---
Good point about the tent, but I don't necessarily want to move mine all over the map.   I like it near Watoga so that I can FT to the other end of the map free from the forest.  
---
Items don't have to be new to appreciated, by me anyway.  You have 200 improved repair kits!   (impressed)   I had about 100, but I'm whittling them down because they actually have weight.   Howver, I still appreciate getting them compared to being offered one more "meh" outfit or unappealing camp item.
---
I'd like to play a season you put together, tho, if you think these are horrible.   :)   Not being sarcastic either.
---
I had 1st that's why the storage space devastated my playthrough
---
Do you have a link to this?
---
I‚Äôm sorry to hear it, friend. 
---
I can help you with ammo or stimpacks if you want to go it alone or run interference for you if you want some help from a tank. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
I guess I don‚Äôt understand where 1 lower level player on an already established higher level team would hurt - u‚Äôd already presumably be getting your effect from strange in numbers from the other 2, you only need 1 player with 1 mutation for it to proc. I get a team full of lower level players,  the likelihood they would have mutations would be lower- but I don‚Äôt see why 1 lower level player would cause a team to immediately be dispersed or that player to be kicked.
---
lol
---
Usually invite everyone to a party (ps4)  always fun to get new perspectives.
---
Killed it fast travel back to my camp... i might never go outside again.
---
Since you‚Äôre a native, is there a pepperoni roll recipe that‚Äôs the real thing?
---
I‚Äôve got no clue the other day I got bored and I bought the mod from the bunker for the t-65 jet pack and I‚Äôm able to craft the cosmos jet with out being that rank and for some reson I can add a jet pack to every peace. But all that dose it add a camouflage paint to it.
---
&gt; You do not lose your card
---
I'm not sure why this is the most upvoted comment, because it's wrong.
---
Read the OP again, they said:
---
&gt; Right when I swiped my card, he jumped on the console and launched it.
---
When you swipe the card, it consumes the card. It does not matter who does the rest of the process; but the card machine eats the card as soon as it's swiped.  
---
...which is the main point the OP was making.
---
They're probably doing unban waves per week instead of per day. Bethesda has alot on their plate especially with the bugs they have to fix and upcoming new content which will also have more bugs.
---
Yesss the winnebago!
---
Just go for the ores and keep them in your inventory until about 30-40 secs left, should have enough by that time :)
---
I was stuck on 2 missions once that both had Wendigo around. Took me months and full squad to work up the balls to finish them. They scare the hell out of me.
---
having the season actually mean something thematically would be nice (esp tied into seasonal events, challenges, creatures, drops, etc).  if the theme is X, then have that reflected in the game experience.  otherwise, it'd be a generous stretch to even call this 'content' beyond those unique atom items interspersed w/ trash (oh boy, another perk card pack bubblegum!...also another 2 copies of lead belly.)
---
Side question - what's the refund process like? I submitted a ticket for refund of the bungalow package on Tuesday 7/21. I have a ticket number but never got an email (most companies would send a confirmation email with the details) and can't find anything on my Bethesda account regarding ticket status. How long does it usually take? Is there any communication, or will I just suddenly have the atoms back?
---
Probably, I do not remember that particular one. There were some stuff and people to meet of course, but it was suprinsingly empty, especially if one is trained by other RPGs that "hard to reach place = good loot"
---
They do have uses espeically for unarmed builds
---
Well. I am sure MANY people are gonna start keeping a few packs of gum from now on
---
[r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/)

Perk cards must have when(if) legendary perks come live. Literally on level 200 I've used almost all unused perks to level up a single legandary card (PTS)
---
The only thing, I'd like to replace xp challenge with something else, since it leads to tons of abusers
---
That reminds me of a funny quote I heard the other day.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the journey not the destination.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNo, this sucked and you failed.‚Äù
---
(Or in this case the legendary drop system sucks and Bethesda failed... Again.)
---
Played from 10 to 80 on a stealth commando build, with a set of lvl 10 unyielding.
---
Oh for sure. I know that I am.
---
Their official statement on this was: "The current limit is there for technical reasons, to cap the number of  items the game is tracking in the world, including every container and  stash."  
---
When I said they couldn't, I didn't mean it's not possible, of course it's possible. I meant it in the sense they couldn't without taking a performance hit, which is basically what you said.
---
I would just throw in more cosmetics, especially camp items. I guess I'm so seasoned that the utility items just haven't done anything for me.
---
m√ñth
---
The more is great, super spooky. Also enjoy thee savage divide
---
after the double xp weekend i finished it and didnt buy ranks, i would log in and do dailies for atoms but now i log in to do 4 rep missions and spend treasury notes that iv massed over all the weeks playing. it feels like theyve shot themselves in the foot a little, i kinda hoped id be put back onto daily atom challenges but its still just useless score... i loved the hype and the systems and rewards it did feel rewarding atleast but now iv finished it i can either go kill robots or play for half hour and play something else instead =/
---
I sell all plans for 50 caps. You might buy the tomahawk, the radaway, the picnic table and the jetpacks. And 100 more.
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap. You can get the cryo, the plasma cartridges, the 5.56 or the .38. 
---
Now, are you going to buy something or what? Get the f*ck out of here.
---
Perk card packs = legendary perks
---
Atom rewards= 1350 so far abd I'm im rank 44. 
---
Caps = always good
---
Gillie paints = some people are into that kind of thing
---
These are good things in general.
---
Were you requesting a cash refund for the purchase of atoms or just a refund of atoms? Not sure how Microsoft would have anything to do with in-game currency but I'm looking for a refund and haven't gotten any help from Bethesda. How do I ask Microsoft for a refund?
---
I get that you're trying to be helpful, but comments like this were actually *not* helpful when I was bobble hunting yesterday.
---
Everyone would read these comments, go immediately to the location(s) mentioned, and by the time I got there the bobblehead was already long gone.
---
I really wish bobbleheads were instanced per player, especially if they're gonna be framing a daily challenge around them.
---
Nope stupid
---
I use an ultra site helmet on my t65 cuz I don't want to pay the price for a helmet that doesn't do crap. But it works just fine.
---
Or use the atoms it gave you 2 levels prior! I'm using my 10 atom rewards for the last ten levels
---
Oh if i am with a lobby with a bunch of high levels and there is a low level in the team, that would be toxic to kick a play due to their level! It just makes new players get put off the game :/
---
T-65 is bugged with a bunch of PA skins and the lights will project out to the right like you are seeing.

Submit a bug report and hope that Bethesda eventually gets to fixing it.
---
And It only takes 12.5 perk packs to get the first level of the new perks. 25 to get the second level, and so on.
---
As a new player who has bought cheap plans from a variety of vendors, thanks üôè
---
No... it wouldn‚Äôt make any sense. Plus, cool skins is one of the only reasons to use power armor. If there were cool skins for normal armor it would give it even less reason to be used
---
Yep. Best value buy too in terms of gold bullion as it is BIS
---
Well it is not stupid as i found a use case of them
---
Well , i really dont think a couple card packs will help a lot with it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i really think gold or exclusive new rewards are infinitely more interesting than a couple exp for legendary cards.
---
I think an event selling us packs for caps or scrips would be a way more interesting.
---
Ash Heap. If I could find a remote hillside overlooking the smoking valley I'd be so happy... Even if I lived in a gas mask. Alas.... I couldn't find anywhere that could sustain my dream camp.
---
They are double bad
---
And what is the point of having a theme for the season if theirs only gonna be like 5 items that have anything to do with the theme? And most of them are at the end which the majority of people probably wont reach
---
Nope triple stupid
---
What I want to know is; are enemy corpses instanced per player? Like, does everyone else see my massive pile of dead SB bodies when they arrive at Watoga station? Or is it just me who sees them?
---
If you are in a group loan wanderer does not work. Ironclad does not work if you are in power armor.
---
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Oh okay you keep buying stealth boys and using them like a dumbass while I use my Chinese stealth suit
---
Thanks for the info, happy hunting
---
Dude, it's SATURDAY... They are not working during the weekend, chill.
---
Ooh, reminds me of my camp overlooking the toxic valley! just east of the crosshair raider camp, in the cliffs.
---
But ironically a good reflection on Bethesda because I honestly expected them to screw up far worse than they have done so far.
---
When you put a card in it is for you, someone else could put a card in after you and it is for  them.   So if you put a card in and are entering your launch code I can come behind you drop a card in and since I launched from that silo before just go to the targeting computer and launch.  Sorry but your information is incorrect.
---
Wait until you have to go into Wendigo Cave.
---
No problem, I think I made that too subtle....."I am fine with just a few good actual rewards because I am getting so many unanticipated rewards. "
---
I know, I only have lone wanderer when I'm not in a group and I never wear power armor but even so it seems they havent been working for me
---
Just checking back in. And it still works. For now. I posted this yesterday, and played earlier today, and my b2525 handmade still reloads insanely fast. I wish there was some way to clock the speed of reload. But I don‚Äôt know. On my handmade, its just fast. I mean lighting fast. I used this method today during Radiation Rumble, and I cleared the back section by myself.... easily. Of course I had all my commando perks on, with tank killer, bloody mess, AND the ‚Äòglowing ones‚Äô perk, and I just shredded it. A lot can be accomplished when your reload speed is half a millisecond.
---
Oh, OKAY. I was just asking, chill.
---
As a low level starter for this season it was helpful at first. But yeah, I've been underwhelmed most of the way through so far, and finally gave up cause it wasn't worth the hour or more a day \*shrugs\*. It did get me playing for a few weeks straight, so good job on that I guess?
---
I now sell that shit for 100 caps each. Aaaaaand they move. Quickly. I don't have the same stock in a day and peeps realise it's becoming more common as a challenge so they buy me out.
---
I'm only working towards the t65 skin and firefly jar
---
Quad triple
---
I some how lost a Unyielding AP refresh Scout chest and it just was missing one day. I noticed my carry weight was off, went to look and it and couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere and never figured out what happened. Nothing I‚Äôve gotten since is anywhere near as useful.
---
Top of the world, is probably the most common area for cargo bots to be. But you can also just ask around, I litterally am sitting about 30 cards as I just dont like running silos
---
Well i choose unyielding armor over stealth suit lol! There are more powerful armours than the stealth suit! With a jetpack on my back and with my build lets me do more damage
---
Yep, I have been kicking myself for missing a handful of those level up challenges the first week or two instead of starting an alt sooner.
---
I noticed there are days but sometimes several in a row when I take a beating  even with both perk cards on it's just maybe they're not registering that they're in play.
---
Yeah, that's literally the only reason I'm running around in t60, just to show of my paladin paint! Ad Victoriam!
---
I do it by hand most of the time, it's pretty fun. I've even written an own algorith dedicated to solving the codes. Still have to google for the stupid english word made out of all the letters tho...why Beth?
---
Ooh I‚Äôve always wanted matte black skins for armor, specifically the scout armor since I have a full set of UNY urban scout. 
---
But back when I used a full set of Vanguards Heavy Combat Armor I liked the shadowed skin because it was black and cool looking, but the BOS skin made my armor way better but I hated the blue skin with the BOS symbol. Having dark matter skins for all armors would be awesome.
---
Had to sell my X to handle bills and jumped on my base Xbox one and this whole game looks Uber ugly on it by comparison lol
---
Panda quad bad
---
You are clapped mate!
---
I mean you're welcome but I get triggered
---
I have perfect amounts of ammo (example 4000 5mm, 2000 fusion etc not actually true numbers just example) as mostly people just buy them all outright but to buy 1 3 times..I have to add 3 more back on lol
---
You should have had an E-mail reply almost immediately, and should be able to see the ticket in you 'My support' page if it's still active. Might need to resubmit.
---
No my cheeks dont pop
---
Just please don't have it equipped during a sbq fight (or if you do don't shoot her in the air)
---
When you stop being able to see your own character. 
---
Jokes aside, I can be invisible with 15 agility and shadowed ultralight combat armor before they fixed it (shadow combat armor was broken) so it is fair to say 15 agility and all sneak perks (sneak + the one with a single star) are enough. 
---
Some pieces of "hard to detect" armor can also make a dramatic difference.
---
Many, it‚Äôs one of the most common bugs right now.
---
What did you say to them? I'm so sad I can only use one :(
---
I assume it does something bad to her AI?
---
I'll bet anything they're full of shit and lying through their teeth to try and make this thread look bad, because god forbid someone has an opinion they dislike. Maybe they did sell dozens... for a meaninglessly small amount. Someone else said they made 6k caps today alone selling ultracite plans, lol. Uh huh, nice story. You wont make 6k caps in a week with that junk unless you're selling the actual rare ultracite plans like calibrated shocks, targeting hud, etc.
---
With that logic, what's the point of having anything in this game? Literally everyone has the same opportunity to have all the same things. 
---
Your level 100 rewards are not more "special" because you decided to grind out your daily chores to gain enough points to unlock them. Its simple completion tasks, not daunting tasks that require a great deal of skill to finish. 
---
The only difference between you and a person who already paid for their ranks is they're now free to enjoy the rewards while you have to play every day for the next x amount of weeks to get them.
---
Agreed!
---
I'm going to go get some pictures of it.   Thanks.   Wish it were alive.  (So I could ya know, kill it...)
---
You're welcome.  I am so happy you found one.  :)
---
I ask because I don‚Äôt know if I should specialize in just non-explosive heavy weapons or do heavy/rifles or what.
---
Todd Howard makes it 3 then immediately starts stroking his 12 inch dick while staring directly into Pete Hinnes eyes.
---
If she staggers while in air she won't land
---
I legit do not understand the point in looting Bones.. what are they useful for? I just to collect them just because I had Fo1st now I just ignore them
---
The stars wallpaper is pretty sweet though.
---
Ah yeah that‚Äôs bad.
---
Crap, meaning I gonna missed out today S.C.O.R.E thanks btw
---
A bit late, but... Use them to learn radium rifle mods and lever mods.
---
I never worry about gum now that I have one.
---
I do believe those are radioactive particles, to 'infuse' the donuts with more flavor.
---
Other than that it's a great perk
---
Boooooo
---
It's a "sence of accomplishment" thing, it's part of what makes the game fun for some people, including myself.  I'm definitely chill with ability to buy ranks and content in general,  but bullion was initially set up outside of that, which made it kind of special.
---
250 isn't the end of the world, but if it's the start of a pattern it will be pretty lame.
---
Funniest drop I had was like 20 frag mines when I fat traveled to I think Sutton Station.
---
I played Saturday morning and had pretty good luck. May just be the time of day you played.
---
Oh it gives you ultracite and bone shard, if you make mutation serums both are quite useful.
---
That would be the best way of doing things, just a flat amount of SCORE XP required for every tier
---
I really like that, I used mine on my t60 until I was around level 100. Eventually I wanted to try the targeting hud so I made the change, I wish the father winter helmet was level 50 and had mods
---
Yeah, my build is a meta heavy gunner, that I can switch to a 2H Melee, didn't know much about the perks either but there are amazing videos on YouTube explaining them in 2 specials each video so it doesn't get overwhelming
---
...I never thought about doing that. I already have teddy bears and mr fuzzys on display, I might start collecting nuka cola too.
---
No they did not.  Some on my friends list are perma banned.  If you have BGS reports against you for behavior it seems you might not be able to come back which IMO is entirely fair.
---
I've got shit tons lol good to know actually but iirc I've got over 600 bone shards maybe more 
---
The only serums i know is Adrenal Reaction and Marsupial
---
Ya no they‚Äôre not bad at all if you use them correctly then there useful. There better than stealth suites and they can make heavy gunner builds op as all hell. And in pvp ow there just the best. So ya I think it would be cool to be able to craft them.
---
And how's your SCORE track?
---
Find a bed. You'll heal while you sleep.
---
I found vendor bot in Ash heap sells them for 10 caps.
---
It sucks, but I‚Äôve had it happen several times and a weekly one too, I‚Äôm up to 17.5k score lost now.
---
I remember when i was in lucky hole mine and i was in the bathroom area near the entrance and one of them dropped from the ceiling and those fuckers are spooky! Imagine if there is mods which made them 10x scarier! They are the only things which spook me in 76
---
You only get perk card packs within nuclear winter and they‚Äôre not every level, I‚Äôm only level 15 in NW and I‚Äôve gotten around 8 I would guess
---
If you have a small backpack (the free plan you get at the Morgantown airport overseer‚Äôs stash box) that one can only carry up to +30 carry capacity when you craft a level 50 version. 
---
If you want a regular backpack, you NEED to do the Tadpole quest line and I believe earn a few Badges in order to acquire the plan. When you craft a level 50 it will give you a +60 carry capacity. And no , just because you have that plan in one character, it doesn‚Äôt mean the other characters you have will unlock it as well. I‚Äôm case you were curious. 
---
If you want to modify your backpack, you need to buy each mod plan with Possum badges. Which means having to do the challenges to each corresponding one. 
---
There‚Äôs one called the high capacity mod. Which gives you a +120 carry capacity. However it also takes away 60 points from your energy and rad resistance. 
---
There are also different mods, feel free to google it.
---
Customer: "Theres puke in my expensive steak!" 
---
Waiter: "If YoU dOn'T lIkE iT, dOn'T eAt It!"
---
Right, but you said "You don't lose your card", when you actually meant "You don't **need** your card."
---
Those are two very different things, and will likely cause confusion. That was the point I was picking at.
---
Great tips!
---
Also, downvoted? That‚Äôs weird.
---
The reason it carries over is because the scorchbeasts actually use a lot of the code from Skyrim‚Äôs dragons
---
Good news old sport, commander dag can strut around completely nude if you do up down left right right triangle square circle strafe off a cliff real quick!
---
I like the forest just because I grew up in an area that looks similar, also the mire is super cool looking in a spooky way
---
Nah, no gold. They need to up the amount you can redeem at one time. The problem with having gold in the pass is that the people who buy ranks are buying the gold, which unlocks endgame gear, essentially making it "pay to win".
---
I believe they're talking about serum recipes.
---
Vats steady boys and quantums are what ruin PvP cause they invalidate everything that isnt a tesla . they definitely arnt better than stealth suits and what crack are you smoking useing them with heavy gunner guilds
---
Just a piece of advice. I stopped running out of lead when I started collecting every single can I see. Really light, really common, really effective.
---
I'm a bloodied build and I collect ore. Pop a diluted radaway and diluted rad-x,  throw on stealth armor, and collect. Your health stays low and you'll regain your rads. You're one of the people you just complained about not collecting tbh. Anyone can collect ore and the event would be awesome if people shared that responsibility rather than just making some other person spend the entire event collecting.
---
Nice. One time the queen died mid air and threw herself way beyond the border, everyone was standing there doing thumbs-down lol, I just fast travelled to train station and there she was. I bet everyone else got theirs too when they FT. Actually when I went back to the border, the queen‚Äôs body reappeared there and sat right across the edge, so it became lootable there too.
---
It‚Äôs more like
---
Waiter: ‚Äúhere‚Äôs free Salisbury steak‚Äù
---
Customer: ‚ÄúI wanted free wagyu‚Äù
---
Thanks cool. I may look into them
---
Holy shit. There was something on the My Support page. I couldn't find that until I actually googled Bethesda My Support. They're asking for all the information I already submitted with the original ticket lol name of item, purchase date, and amount of atoms. Maybe this will push it through. Thanks!
---
They‚Äôre creepy and fast as hell, but just wait until you have a run in with the wendigo colossus
---
Okay so CAMP building is insanely fun and there's a chunk of new pre fab buildings to work with.
---
However if you've launched a nuke and killed a queen.... Well.... There's not a lot more to do other than dig for gold and play the RNG game.
---
But focussing on positives, I build a new CAMP every five minutes and fuck it's satisfying!
---
I really wanna get that skin for the gatling gun for my heavy gunner build, but man the progression is making it really hard.
---
To be honest, I really couldn't care less about the upcoming events or endgame raid content or any of that. So I don't really care about having the best of the best of the best of everything.
---
I searched for an hour at least and finally gave up, ended up opening 3 perk card packs I had
---
Yea some require bone shards, I forgot which ones, maybe Carnivore or Herbivore? It takes like five shards per serum, so if you craft a whole bunch, it‚Äôs good to have some stored.
---
I don't say to get rid of gold/atoms/whatever. Couple of perk cards always will be useful for legendary perks. On high level it's pretty hard to get enough cards to mas at least one legendary.
---
1-&gt;2 requires 100 perk coins
---
2-&gt;3 requires 150 perk coins
---
Next levels I don't know, since I had no perk card to scrap, lol
---
1 regular 1lvl perk card = 1 perk coin (each level +1 coin)
---
And you will have 6 or 7 of legendaries (don't remember exactly)
---
Yeah, those packs won't significantly help you, but still better then nothing
---
I'm not going to complain about the perk packs. Atom knows we'll need them for legendary perks. But I agree with everything else... Like everything else in this game, it's a slow grind with somewhat disappointing rewards.
---
I do the same, have the fastnacht collectron, get gum all the time, so i sell it to keep caps flowing
---
Well said.
---
What do you play on?
---
Yeah, overlooked legendary perks
---
PC
---
Ah, didn't know that good to know if I ever decide to buy more lol
---
I use them all the time to solo queen, if I run sneak and a flamer and or a gauss mini I can do it in a couple of minutes. And in pvp i use them because i use pa and a be gat plaz. Personally for me quantum‚Äôs are not as big of a problem with me being on console and quantum spamming being hard to do. So ya I use them all the time and it‚Äôs great I think I‚Äôve got a couple hundred of them saved up for there use some day.
---
Right, forgot that we are living in an all happy place and the customer and company are best friends. Oh, and the company is always right, don't forget that! You guys do realize that you're being played? Oh my, what am I saying? The truth that hurts or the lie that fuels? I don't know myself anymore. Why speak up and voice your opinon? That's old news! JUst accept what you're being fed! Don't be critical! Be supportive, 'cause that makes your life better!...or does it?
---
I am a god, you cannot kill a god! What a grand and intoxicating innocence...
---
Was it Penelope or was it her parents?
---
Penelope gave up her own life in order to get her family into a Vault so to me she‚Äôs an amazing human and I would choose her side no matter what she/her parents did in the past.
---
She doesn‚Äôt deserve more than what‚Äôs already happened to her.
---
Tru. Especially in Nuclear winter
---
You must be on ps4 then if there hard to use most people I fight on xbox have the elite controller and have them how keyed to paddles
---
The way I go about it, is I go to a text chat support with microsoft. I usually tell them something I bought is not working the way it should and the few times I have had to do this, they refund my atoms purchase with the money I spent on it.
---
well is the only content left to high lvls to do and is easy.
---
Frog legs perk card
---
Yep I think some other serums use it too, something like melee related.
---
Sweet didn‚Äôt know that thanks
---
This right here
---
This isn't a bug. It was a feature added long ago to help people loot them when they die out of bounds and such. Repurposed dragon code from Skyrim.
---
Back in the start of the same SBQ would die out of bounds or meat piles in 20 seconds and couldn't loot. Now she follows you if you don't loot.
---
Do you know the stats it boosts? I don‚Äôt really care about dr/er since they‚Äôre all pretty close, I just want more strength
---
How could you be so naive? There is no escape. No recall or intervention can work in this place. Come, lay down your weapons. It is not too late for my mercy.
---
Oh gotcha. I will have to try that if Beth doesn't process my refund soon. Thank you for the info!
---
I don‚Äôt understand what ghillie suits have to do with the space theme? If they wanted to do ghillie suits, why didn‚Äôt they just make season 2 like a safari jungle theme. You could have blow-pipe skins for the bow with different animations. Man, it would be cool.
---
I hate thinking about the next two seasons using the same exact challenges
---
Isn't there a similar thing you can craft after doing the mistress of mystery quest?
---
Omg getting the lap pillow from that sexy ghoul, luckyyyy
---
Well thats true i didnt considered it when i post it.
---
200 per day ita ridiculous ! It should be at least 350 and 500 with smiley.
---
Making a daily grind so low for sure wont make people play for more time.
---
Cuz the ones that grind treasure notes everyday are the same guys that play this game since 2018  even when there was nothing to grind in the game.
---
The point is what was suposed to keep people playing this game for more time isnt working exactly for it , the "casual" Players just give up after some days of grinding , and the hardcore players need to wait weeks and weeks for a SS power armor set just because bethesda thinks that gold bullion its working in keep casuals playing the game.
---
You need 9 agility though, to use it
---
Just made a buttload of SS arms with super duper on.  I would get the sound like I got a duplicate but after the first 30 its hard to keep track of things
---
Once i get that beloved sheepsquatch plushie, I'm done.
---
I‚Äôm critical of Bethesda my last post was literally ranting about a bug, the entire last half of that comment is very ‚Äúwe live in a society‚Äù it‚Äôs a video game I‚Äôve already bought it so if they want to throw some free cosmetics my way even tho they‚Äôre behind a grind im cool with that.
---
Yes please!
---
Maybe a slight overreaction? I mean, you could've always done another silo run.
---
Things have changed. Things are the same. Things have got better. Things have got worse.
---
There, now you're caught up.
---
Super mutants spawning on my head as I tried to walk around the forest region fresh out of the vault.
---
Nope Xbox for me bud. I guess it‚Äôs because I can kill someone really fast and I use stims because in pa there insta use. And in Xbox pvp stealth boys are a requirement at least people that get deep into it. If your using a stealth suite in pvp then most people can insta kill ya. Or your one of those annoying people that sit in a corner in a work shop after someone kills ya.
---
I don‚Äôt know, but I can overstate how good the Stabilized perk is
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll have to look for a build guide to see what others are doing.
---
Agree to disagree.
---
That‚Äôs valid, if all you like is one thing just go get that one thing for free and carry on!
---
Yeah. Stabilized is a huge difference.
---
Getting murdered by 2 shot explosive pumps
---
I figured it was this, thank you for confirming it
---
Sure, but I don't have to agree with your, or anyone else's, criticism.
---
Do keep in mind that apparently only .png files will show up in game as loading screens.  I have one that's a jpg (which I need to convert) which has never shown up, which leads me to believe that this is the case (also that the game saves screenshots as .pngs to begin with).
---
Anyone remember around 10 years ago when game developers were getting super excited about fully destructible environments? I think the only game to really go all-in on it was like, Red Faction Guerrilla...
---
(Aside from world-building games like Minecraft obviously)
---
I found it much easier to move along without a hyperspecialized build with upgrading the level of my weaponry and armor as I went. \
---
The only legendary I use is for melee, zealots.
---
Any other challenge, place a camp, NW is fun
---
Kill X creatures, level up Overseer rank and suddenly I'm getting fucked over left right and Center 
---
I WON A NW MATCH TODAY SINCE IT WAS A CAMP PLACEMENT!!!
---
Nope. I‚Äôm used to Bethesda‚Äôs laziness
---
Na I'm suprised you haven't heard of me or my bud on xbox my gt is mister myzptix I'm known for pvping in only a stealth suit . if you ever wanna fight hit me up
---
You must be a Destiny player, lol.
---
Its frog legs, you might as well create a new character to try and get it after a while since its so essential
---
Lovely. Honestly the early game age of people trying to bait each other into pvp was hilarious.
---
Well in my personal opinion still worthless ,really dont think people still spending cards after level 150 , and its common AF find level 250+ players now a days.
---
Iam level 650 and have like 400 points to distribute and still think that tge cards are useless for me and for level 80 players in same way lol.
---
But thank you for the explanation !! Can help people that doesnt know how legendary cards will work üòÅüëçüèª
---
First day of BETA and seeing how beautiful the landscape was.
---
It's after the apocalypse, why would anyone who sat in a vault for 25 years care?
---
I'm just glad the dopey looking PA skins and jetpacks are at the back along with the relatively lame fireplace as my end target is the chicken coop.

I don't need a secret door.... I need chickens.... Chickens *behind* a secret door... That could be *something*...

I just stopped playing all together. 1000+ hours in that game and I‚Äôm bored. What am I grinding for? I‚Äôm done grinding skins I won‚Äôt use and more camp items I won‚Äôt use while waiting for the next grind to be released. I‚Äôll come back when they add some actual substance to the game.
---
Fighting with customer support when I didn't get the duffle bag I was promised.
---
Oh favorite?

Uh.. hmm

Especially melee
---
Currently level 45, but I only get to play 2 to 3 times a week. Usually too busy during the week with kids and work.
---
I usually like her but that one sentence makes me dislike her for a bit.
---
She's very generic and feels more like a 2020 person from our universe than a Fallout character.
---
Yeah the whole merch fiasco for everything they offered was a real bummer.
---
Only zealots? So you like doing 15% more damage to some of the enemies you meet? Why not a bloodied, junkies or instagating?
---
Most games don‚Äôt have over 1000 hours of content that‚Äôs not really a valid criticism lmao.
---
The thing is, you could‚Äôve done ALL the missions for the raiders and the settlers. Until you got a mission called ‚ÄúSiding with..‚Äù that‚Äôs the last mission, once you pick a side to do that mission with, then you‚Äôll be locked out of switching sides. 
---
So you could‚Äôve done all the missions for the settlers. Got the Chinese stealth armor for free with the mission they ask you to do. And you still could‚Äôve sided and finished the quest line with the raiders. 
---
But don‚Äôt worry. You can still get the suit. You just have to pay in gold. And it‚Äôs a lot. I think you have to reach a certain reputation with the settlers though.
---
I've been playing the game since the beta
---
I got booted from an events team because I was in my camp while an event was happening, which it wouldn‚Äôt affect their boost if I participate or not. Funny thing was that the event was long over before someone new joining the team would have bonded. Their xp loss. I guess some people don‚Äôt really think about the mechanics of it all.
---
btw the first challenge I coulnt complete. I run over 10 places where it can be found and i restart 12 times the private server at the same location. I found a whole bunch of magazines though but never a bubblehead. So i think they actually want to f\*\*k up some players with autocomplete challenges or impossible challegenges. 200% sure

Happened to a full set of T-60 I spent the better half of a month collecting. This was also when I was decently newer to the game when I had issues finding aluminum.
---
I must be  high on jet, I thought the screaming eagle skin was ok.
---
Because if you are rebuilding a society you probably do not want someone who clearly had no respect for people below her helping you.
---
I never really charge above 1,000
---
Holy crap... This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard of this issue.
---
One friend I had on PS4 said he had a gauntlet I gave him stolen from his inventory. He said 4 or 5 players surrounded him and all started clicking the trade button on him and canceling it over and over. He fast traveled away from them and noticed some of his weapons were missing. This was way before meat cook.
---
Second time I heard of this, another friend said someone at Project Paradise stole 20k 5mm rounds from him somehow by initiating the trade menu with him. This happened right before the vault raid was removed. 
---
This might be a long time issue people been keeping secret that‚Äôs finally coming to light. Bethesda needs to investigate this, whatever it is, it has something to do with the trade menu. ( u/Ladydevann If you‚Äôd be so kind as to investigate this that would be great.)
---
I‚Äôm staying in my private server till further notice... Not risking my gear that‚Äôs taken me 1500 hours to get.

here's an old blog post that is the closest to the kind my family has made. they're soft rectangular rolls, with a bit of sugar in the dough and in the "glaze," which is really just a melted butter topping. the pepperoni is cut from stick pepperoni (as shown in the pictures), but you can use large round sliced pepperoni (layered about 5-6 pieces) laid out on the flat dough and rolled up with it, or the smaller kind you use on pizza (this tends to be the most oily). traditional miner's pepperoni rolls don't have cheese, vegetables or other meat in them - just the pepperoni - but you can get a kind made hot on fresh bread with melted provolone at some pizza places. they keep really well and don't need to be refrigerated, which made them perfect lunches for coal miners.

I always made my kids quick little "pepperoni buns" for their lunches when they were little using refrigerated biscuit dough wrapped around pizza pepperoni into balls, buttered and baked. good picnic finger food and they loved them. hope you enjoy!
---
I like the skin for the Gatling but man if you look at the product image page, the handle is still attached to the back of user‚Äôs fingers. When can Beth ever fix those funny details lol
---
Welcome! Fun and frustrating times for all!
---
You and your friend need to be in a regular team, not a public team. 
---
Your friend has to be the leader of the team. 
---
As long as they have their mission selected, you should be able to see what mission they are doing in the top right of your screen. 
---
I think the only exceptions are certain miscellaneous missions, and some dailys. They won‚Äôt show up at all for you. I don‚Äôt know why. 
---
Other than that, main missions and the rest will pop up for you.
---
But she does.
---
Speaking of the fixer anyone have the fixer plan on pc by chance? :P
---
Well yes, you don't have to do the legendary run. But, they advertised the summer season as ‚Äùa new way to experience WV‚Äù, it's not, it's the same dailies/weeklies with a new accounting system. They advertised three new capabilities, they delivered one. And both the new gameplay and rewards have bugs. Finally, if you don't have an optimal build or play hours each day the grind is horrendous. Finally2, it's not free for FO 1st members.
---
I don‚Äôt really fight any more with all the changes and how team fights work, I would say me last big pvp fight was with The Beach Boys on Xbox and me and my buds won that day and started there quick demise as a group. And that‚Äôs cool if you can make it work in a stealth suite but i mean at the end of the day I would still say that stealth boys are key for pvp and even pve for me in cases, that might be the old school part of me that still uses old things and doesn‚Äôt like to change there stile. I mean I‚Äôve had what I use for pvp for over a year at this point and it still hasn‚Äôt changed and will never change. They can make explosive Gatling plasmas do trash dmg or what ever I‚Äôll still use them for that fact that I‚Äôve use it from day one.
---
This is why you should never be logged on at reset.
---
Go to the asylum, and do it solo.  
---
It's great walking around the halls, hearing the heavy breathing, not knowing where it's coming from.
---
I mean, we all saw the evils Senator Blackwell committed, soooo....
---
I just passed it by 3. I admit I paid once the atoms to rank up because stupid me thought i could get the star lamp by paying lol
---
Phew,  this caught my eye with the left leg roll.  I got my first piece of SS and legendary mod yesterday, and rolled a two * unyielding for the... Left leg,  haha :/ I shouted for joy and my gf just stared at me: I said, you don't know how precious this is! On the first roll, SMH.
---
Valid point. I just really love that game and wish there was more to do for end game like decent repeatable dungeons or something like that.
---
Are you inside the launch tube?
---
If youre part of the tr@de sub, click the menue tab, than there's an official abbreviations list there
---
I still remember the first time I picked up a ranged weapon, a pipe gun outside a barn, pew pew and I wondered where I can find some ammo lol
---
I mean the atomic onslaught skins are pretty sexy.
---
And hey they can learn from this with season 2.
---
According to rumors or speculation season 2 will be BOS themed which pretty epic.
---
Do the event monster mash and loot the building
---
Got it to work, thanks for the suggestions.  Wife was going to be pissed at me if I made her run a silo for nothing
---
Math is neat
---
Never heard of it but thanks anyway
---
Thats understandable but at the same time its so essential to the game mode. I find a lot of end game situations come down to frog legs and grenade launchers
---
That‚Äôs fair, there is more on the way soon though I‚Äôm hopeful, we‚Äôve got meat week coming sometime later next month or so, the wendigo colossus event soon , that new precursor BOS quest and then the big expansion coming in the winter. I really wish they would bring back vault raids and have them as a constant or a rotating feature.
---
What system are you on ü•∫
---
Ah I used to fight them to but back when it was just whisk, scandolus, savvy, and stituated early days of PvP for me I used shotties and rocked a set of sentinel assassins , I had to change do to a nerf since ive been a bloodied commado build never really found a need for stealth boys but I did use quantums for a while for free heals
---
Huh? I've seen a few people with it at their camps and looks fine to me
---
The math just aint mathin‚Äô
---
when I first saw a pepperoni roll. as much as I've enjoyed the atmosphere, sounds and references in the game to my home state, I almost choked up with nostalgia when I first ran across one on my character. since then, I've seen so many other authentic references and representations of west virginia in FO76 I'm glad I get to go back there every day, at least in a game.
---
Good thing these arn't exactly rare or valuable lol. You can probably get another one?!
---
That‚Äôs ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù that requires going to level 3.  OP is talking about the Nuclear Winter challenge to increase your overseer level.
---
50 is secondary for 50 crit vats. 90 is weapon weight. 33 is secondary +33% vats. 15 is reload speed and crit fill. The 25 is less vats and faster fire rate. All can think of top of my head. Should be able to google fallout 76 legendary effects.
---
Bless you and thank you,
---
- bush wookie.
---
Agreed but the plushie Sheep Squatch has my heart
---
Ok, well let you do that. It will cost 1000 faction coins. You can earn up to 100 faction stickers a day. You can cash in 10 of those stickers for 50 faction ticket, up to 500 tickets a day. Then you can cash in those tickets at a rate of 90 tickets for 10 faction coins. You can get up to 150 faction coins a day. However, this only unlocks after you complete the faction adventure quest and they weigh 1 lb each.
---
I‚Äôve always got the spirit of a PA/Heavy but always lack the supplies due to my level, however PA/Heavy/Melee always seemed safest (and more badass) to me. Nothing like charging into battle with a heavy and then bonking the remaining enemies to death.
---
Yeah, the camp items are fire.
---
Probably so they can control it and boot people.
---
Yup ever since the last hot fix that patched the duping mine been crashing like it did during launch month. Before that hot fix I was crashing once a day at most over a ~12 hour play period

True. That‚Äôs why I was thinking shotgun if they get in my face just start blasting.
---
Yes, that's true.  Especially since it seems pretty clear you weren't ever really interested in discussion.
---
There's supposed to be a 3 or 4 week gap between seasons
---
You‚Äôre happy with a 1 star? i got one and immediately dropped it because i need ap :(
---
Love the double barrels, having a full set of fresh power armor and that feels like I‚Äôm doomslayer and I had too many cheeseburgers
---
I agree completely! That's why I have logged on 3+ hours after reset every single day so far.
---
Today I actually logged on 7 hours after reset. I have NEVER been on +/- 3 hours of reset.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt break the disk just throw the whole ps4 out the window
---
I knew OP was but I think the guy I replied to thought he meant the regular level up. Considering the overseer rank does not increase from leaving the vault
---
How so?
---
yes, it is. even better than stealth boy
---
The chickens do not have feathers. They are featherless

Ya I‚Äôm guessing you had the sent ass marine set or the Marine set with one combat part. Ya the good old days where the community was great and everyone was just there to have fun and kill things. Ya I mean me and you run completely different builds, you run the sneak around and almost never get hit while I run the I‚Äôm gonna just stand here and shoot everything. So ya I mean you know how much of a difference sneaking makes to commando builds so with me having that with a gauss mini it makes queens so much cheaper and easier. And the easiest way for me to do that is to pop sneekie boi and do my max dmg.
---
Hahahaha. Yeah but I don‚Äôt know if I should buff heavy guns (taking more heavy gunner perks) or boost shotguns (take more shotgunner perks) since they are all STR. Or try to take equal of both but not boost any of them by a lot.
---
I really really enjoy all the camp pieces. Those alone are worth it to me. 
---
The atoms are honestly pretty toasty. I almost never touched my dailies before. Now I love them
---
Someone earlier today or yesterday posted that the Appalachian Thunderpipe ammo drum blocks the front sights...hopefully they fix this soon.
---
When they fix the Screaming Eagle skin.
---
And add combat rifle skins to the fixer.
---
I really appreciate that
---
I could say the same of you. Opinions are personal things, you'd be more likely to win the lottery than to convince someone to abandon thier completely reasonable opinion on something, especially something so trivial.
---
u can craft the " mistress of mystery " version
---
His Brother's Keeper is a gnarly name for a shotgun. My condolences.  Rest In Power, little shotty. 
---
Sidenote: I like to skin and favorite wheel my best guns to help prevent accidents.
---
This is the sort of mentality that ruined world Of Warcraft for me.
---
I go well out of my way to help lower level players, dont even care if it's an alt.
---
Could care less if I miss finishing my dailies even so long as they had fun. Will usually straight up give people serums if I see there missing some key ones I can make.
---
It will play the animation and make the noise, however you won't get an extra armor piece. It's been tested many times. Very lame.
---
I just want some double barrel shotgun skins and fixer skins. Does anyone actually use the guns that the skin rewards are given to?
---
I personally can't stand her especially when she says Appalachia radio isn't hers and she goes on to say she's "not gonna act like she owns it or anything" well you already set up shop there you might as well say you own it now
---
That is very true, my gauss still takes a couple minutes and way longer if she keeps flying away
---
And they will do exactly that. Have you seen them change much since january up until the season start? Devs just slap together a list of the easiest tasks and be done with it for a year or so. They change it only in case of major patches that add some new mechanics (like it happened with brewing stations release or prosnap camera implementation. God damn I hated to drink and craft tons of alcohol each day and take photos while intoxicated for months...)
---
I usually like to boost heavies because shotguns are pretty good on their own with the right mods or not
---
Yep but there really broken and don‚Äôt work half the time. And the max time that you can use them in 30 seconds with perks not applying to it. And it takes a stealth boy to make it.
---
What made the gatling a legacy? Don't they all have a crank?
---
Ah ok so maybe 3/3 on all heavy gunners and like 1/3 or 2/3 on the basic shotgunner? Maybe take the shotguns have better spread and accuracy perk too?
---

---
Yeah, I've no idea why this guy is claiming you don't lose your card in this situation. You absolutely do. Unless I misunderstood OP, he inserted his nuclear key card, went to put in the code, and when he turned around the other guy was on the console to select the nuke location.
---
If that's the case, the card is gone, and OP needs to acquire another one.
---
My latest character is a support medic responder, focused on hoarding insane amounts of food, chems, meds, etc. Weight reduction perks, armor, etc.
---
She always has what the team needs. It's like a mom who thinks ahead.
---
Random with no forgiveness system is not a fun system for almost everyone involved. 
---
Often, even when someone gets the roll, it still feels bad for what it took to get there and the fact that you had almost no influence over getting it or not.
---
Kids these days.
---
You really do live up to your name. I was comparing the economy to explain why in the grand scheme of things the in game economy is completely arbitrary. Nothing in game has real worth, so saying duping hurts Bethesda monetarily or the completely arbitrary economy is a waste of breath. Also, telling people to not play when they give legitimate criticism of something is a fantastic way to diminish the player base.
---
I was intimidated by that thing when I started out, made sure to never even open the pen.
---
In the early launch days when my buddies and I were still leveling our first character,  we stumbled across a super mutants behemoth. I then loudly proclaimed that I would slay the beast and told my fellow vault dwellers to stand back. I then armed myself with a black powder pistol, shouted "tally ho lads" loudly into my mic, and charged the abomination. I managed to reach his leg and fire my weapon, his health bar did not budge and he then proceeded to turn around and bop me on the head with his fire hydrant. It made the "clank" sound and I died immediately.  We all burst into a fit of laughter, and to this day I have yet to have such a memorable moment in the game.
---
Thanks, I'm interested then but I'm on UK time, hopefully I wouldn't be the only one...
---
Not all of us like running in PA so it would make sense for us stealth builds who run normal armor not power armor.
---
You are the type of player that makes the fallout community and game experience what it is. When I was a low level I used to love when I‚Äôd come back to my camp and have a little goody bag full of surprises, even if it wasn‚Äôt much it was still great.
---
This is incorrect. When you insert the card, someone can slide in behind you while you input the code and take control of the console. It happens all the time. There are literally dozens of posts in this sub about it. 
---
You do not get to keep the card when this happens. OP will need to replace the card.
---
I've been hoarding my gum since the first gum challenge.
---
One of my closest friends in the chapter is in the UK, and we have at least half a doezen others I can think of that are as well.
---
I'd say the super sledge, gatlin gun, and handmade would be about it
---
I throw some up for 0 ocassionaly as well.
---
.........
---
................
---
........ Well. I'm sure if we call the vet we can get on top of it early. There's probably a cream or ointment for it.
---
Rank 52 and above all require 25 more SCORE than we all projected. 25 extra SCORE * 48 remaining ranks = 1200.
---
The game doesn't know you want Unyielding. To be honest, I scripped dozens of bloodied weapons and Unyielding gear before I started getting into it.
---
Yeah I'm on paternity leave and once it's over I probably will fall way back.
---
Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin
---
It's just the name of the skin, there is no effect.
---
I got burnt out after day 3. I actually haven't visited this sub since then. It's been great catching up on other games like Days Gone and Ghost of Tsushima. I played religiously for like 4 months but now I'm just waiting for Season 2 or BoS drop.
---
I‚Äôm with you! It is definitely a little annoying that we can‚Äôt do that. Tried to build a spooky cabin with the moth man red wall paper and it just looked so out of place. Sad faces all around.
---
My whole problem is that it leads up to a 5 minute long rant. 
---
Like just get to the music. I need to hear oh zazu.
---
Great stuff! Though as you can see I can keep odd hours lol, I'll take an invite
---
Everyone needs to remember, Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care about your gaming experience, they only care about getting your money.  Most micro transaction money comes from a small group of players (whales), these are the people who are actually *BUYING* atoms.  It is in Bethesda‚Äôs best interest to have a small amount of really great stuff, put it waaaaay at the end, and then make the grind very very difficult (big surprise, that‚Äôs exactly what they did), so that people are *required* AND *desire* to spend a bunch of atoms to actually get there.   The only reason they have made it easier this far is it being functionally impossible scares off the whales.  They still fully expect people to only get part of the way then pay to finish.  
---
With this in mind, it should surprise no one that the vast majority of the items are just garbage filler, until you get to the last ten-ish levels.
---
Whiny, nasally voice actor.  I can't stand listening to her one bit.
---
Also, swapped all my camp radios to classical music and make it a point to find and shut off any world radio playing her station within earshot.
---
I'd rather listen to the Ft. Defiance scorch thing than her.
---
Would love if we could prepackage useful loot items into starter kits to more swiftly drop them for peeps.
---
For the now I drop excess useful items on a safe in my vendor room for peeps to pick through in case any of it would be of use to rhem.
---
They look pretty damn ugly on a high end pc as well. I mean, how hard was it to even make an animation for them to go off in a classic spherical pattern of particles that shimmer in the dark for a lil' while? Nope, it's just a plain cross. I get it, I've seen it couple times *as a small part of larger fireworks compositions* irl, but only this one cross? It looks pretty damn dissapointing to be called fireworks in the first place. I won't even call it a reward, really. It feels pretty damn unrewarding to even try to launch them.
---
Damn, couple flares from a flare gun look more spectacular in the nightsky than these so-called "fireworks"...

This is the game I play. Sure, I stopped for a couple of weeks when Streets of Rage came out, but then, I returned.
---
I will probably stop playing when the next Skyrim or Fallout arrives. Or if a New Vegas remake is released.
---
The saddest part is all the experiences like this you could have had if you played it back then too. Been playing since release and still get these experiences
---
it's already implemented even before wastelander. already got 2-3* legendaries from a 1* mob. of course it depends on the rng. what i want is to reduce the price of legendary modules. you spend 100 scripts just to get a 1-2* items with dissapointing stats.
---
The legendary glowing mirelurk king in there is infinitely worse than the wendigo for me.
---
I actually heard an NPC there talking to Bessie telling her multiple combat commands followed by "Bessie initiate combat protocols" to which Bessie did nothing implying that she no longer had any combat functions and was pretty much programmed to mimic a Brahmin and only a Brahmin.
---
IDK trying to assign patterns to randomness is tricky business. I'd say maybe keep a bunch of what you want to roll on you and in your stash and equipped also. I was getting a bunch of unyielding early on and never got rid of em. Just kept some in my stash and some on my character. Along with the ones I had equipped too. And I feel like that might have tricked the game into thinking I don't need it :)
---
4 atr 4 endurance 2 perception if memory serves
---
Considering that the drum on the unskinned gat damn near blocks the sight it is not surprising.  I just run the standard mag anyway, 250 rounds on that hard-hitting slow fire heavy is very much adequate.
---
Tea pot gift shop in the scale.  In the bus outside Camden park.
---
One building in FO4 had a chest with special legendary Institute armor that reduced/negated fall damage.
---
If someone new to the game values yet another 2500c, it's most likely they struggle getting even this amount of caps and never had more than few thou on hand at any given moment, not to say almost 20k for a serum recipe at ws bunker. I guess they were talking about the most expensive camp or PA plans you can buy from vendor bots in the main WS building.

Edit: typo
---
The worst kept trade secret is that Kronik‚Äôs Cabin‚Äôs fusion cores accelerate entropy and therefore bring forward the heat death of the universe by several millennia.
---
Come to Mad Vlad‚Äôs wonder emporium, where we‚Äôve stabilised dark matter to ensure safe consumption for the entire family.
---
This is fucking gold
---
Shes literally the only one there and the vault dwellers claimed appalachia as their own so might as well say its her own.
---
I probably won't make it, but I'll get as far as I can.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea. I agree by the time I  scroll through my stuff  to drop it, people are already high-tailing it outta there.
---
Why do I see many builds on YouTube and in daily play that had the bungelow on a second floor? I got the bundle for this reason, and now cannot place it anywhere but the ground. Is there a glitch possible?
---
I'd rather play with honest people than cheaters and scammers . I've had a few things scammed from media to me believing everyone is honest and are going to do the right thing.People are selling things on eBay for real money. Things that supposedly have dont have real worth according to you
---
It‚Äôs a decommissioned military sentry bot and therefor didn‚Äôt have any weapons when they got her. That one dude out front, his name is Jeb or something, he‚Äôll attack you if you kill the Brahmin
---
Aye, it's true. It's in our terms of service tho so we aint legally liable.
---
Oh yeah, he's a straight bastard! I can't count how many times he's busted a piece of my armor.
---
I got the raider cage today. To be honest, the fun way of doing  the run was to create a whole new character and start from level 1, doing a bit of Wastelanders and a bit of the main and sidequests. 
---
You do a lot more when you haven't done a lot yet. You visit more places, fight more enemies and have more fun.
---
I made the point that I only bought the bundles for the smoke machines, and that I wouldn't use much else from the bundles, and that they were purchased before that change to the machines
---
Lol the whole game is easy mode as it is, amusing people have to do this.
---
Happens to me and I'm 457. I don't take it personal. I think of my own play style. Sometimes a friend comes on and there's not enough room so I make my own. Maybe I server hop. Maybe I quit. Log in with an alt. There's a lot of character movement. Don't take it personal just enjoy the perks when it's good.
---
Remove your camp module skin, surprise surprise the future tec skin doesn‚Äôt work correctly
---
On ps4 is square on the board screen
---
I love fallout 76 and the universe that is fallout. But I would've waited one more year after BETA for them to polish the game properly and add what is needed or wanted by the community. It just feels so rushed. Wastelanders was a good way forward but little things like this, or lack thereof, take away from the experience of the Fallout franchise I love so much.
---
That would work
---
It‚Äôs got the stats of a T-45 helmet so you should be able to put T-45 mods on it, not sure though
---
That sounds amazing! Thank you!
---
Could be that they had a hidden machine with the rest of them in it
---
Do you happen to know where or when they confirmed this?
---
Yes, fellow Prime. This is the way.
---
No. It‚Äôs honestly a waste of a perk. When you‚Äôre a heavy gunner, you‚Äôre usually killing everything in less than a few seconds and most enemies with one burst, so it doesn‚Äôt make a difference in almost any situation
---
firefly jar is barely noticeable it hangs with little to no illumination.
---
Oh yeah after getting speed demon and having high agility I been running into places before they load. I quite like it haha
---
Sometimes discussions and arguments aren't for the individuals, but for the observers.  You're right though, some people have already made up their minds and are steadfast in what they believe going into an argument or a discussion, just as you made it clear from the start this sort of discussion is below you with how you feel it's 'trivial'. 
---
However, others might be more keen to listening to the arguments made from others and the reasoning for those positions.  But, more importantly, the real purpose here is feedback and conveying an issue with content so that developers might see and respond.  It's what we're encouraged to do.
---
So yeah, it's basically an almost useless set of rewards, considering there's not that many perk packs on the board.
---
I really hope they will hear us testers and lots of people here who supported the notion to decouple legendary perk upgrades from scrapping perk cards since it was an absolutely stupid idea from the start on so many levels.
---
Well... Running away from my first scorchbeast. I hid inside someone's camp. He was a lvl42 and was wielding an All Rise, which meant he was a hardcore high level in power armor.
---
Ah, that was it. But I've had the chameleon mutation forever, was it broken until recently?
---
Fruit Stripe is the absolute bomb for the first seven seconds or so.
---
Agreed. I also see a lot of posts saying it's underwhelming. I've loved everything in this game board. You need filler stuff like atoms and gold. But I love the chicken coop. I love the plushie. I'm also having fun getting through the board. Started an alt doing the main story again for steam achievements.
---
I think a lot of those who are most vocal find this subreddit. Like those who hate 1st subs. But play the game and every single camp has a 1st box.
---
I enjoy it all.
---
I think majority of ammo should be sold at 1 cap/ammo except for the energy ammo.
---
Just don‚Äôt use the future tec skin from the legendary run if you‚Äôve unlocked it. It will make your camp icon disappear from the map, making it to where you can‚Äôt even fast travel to your own camp
---
Still better than the season pass for "For Honor".
---
You do need to know the t-65 jetpack plan before you can use it.  That's how most atom shop ones are.  There is a bug with the freestates one that lets your appy it without knowing the plan.
---
As someone who paid for fallout 1st...
---
No
---
Fucking
---
Shit.
---
We are the stupid ones for expecting more from bethesda.
---
I can two shot the wendigo from stealth but that mirelurk king haunts me. I have to sneak around him, I literally cannot kill it. Any time I go to that cave I just stealth around a different way into the wendigo's chamber.
---
Well it‚Äôs at least honest, Dark (Black) Matter and everything is technically matter.
---
All I want is the chickens
---
Yes it is. Just keep doing that line of quests (which is the old main quest line before Wastelanders).
---
I think it‚Äôs less about it being hard and more about wanting it not to take forever. I don‚Äôt think people have to do it. But I do agree if people are wanting to do it maybe Bethesda needs to re-evaluate the event and change some things.
---
Do you know the jetpack plan for the t-65?

In the grand scheme, this is the definition of first world problems, absolutely qualifying as trivial. That being said, just because I don't agree with someones opinion, doesn't mean thier feelings on a matter are less relevant than mine, I simply don't share in thier opinion. There is no right or wrong when it comes to opinions, they simply differ, and should the Devs see this, at least they know some of us appreciate thier efforts to make the game enjoyable.

I'm still trying to figure out where the spot is. So if I have one there and it's wrong it's not intentional it's me not knowing. I've seen videos and others do it but when I do it... Just doesn't work.
---
I run nothing but bloodied weapons and unyielding armor. Seems I get everything BUT those :)
---
I‚Äôm like tier 34 and it let me apply it even though I‚Äôm nowhere near unlocking it. It‚Äôs also letting me apply a camo jetpack to every piece which will make it look sick but overwrite every other mod, so I‚Äôm saving up cobalt flux and crafting a new set so I still have my default one. It‚Äôs gonna be the most expensive PA paint I‚Äôve ever done

---
That‚Äôs roughly what it would be.
---
Being bat shit scared as a level 2 around people who were sooo high at level 30. This was beta days and no one understood PvP yet. I would see a real person and head for the damn hills.
---
Once in particular I was crawling through flatwoods with a pipe pistol hugging the buildings. Every person was in this town as everyone started around the same time. I was so fearful of them.
---
I realized at 5 PvP kicks in and learned about slap damage. But boy my heart was going üòÇ
---
I also remember being in the vault and hearing others talking in the area chat. Someone was talking on a live stream about the bad press of the game but played anyway. 
---
I have tons of memories. Seems like a completely different game now from what I left the vault into.
---
I run a junkies heavy gunner and it‚Äôs super fun but also really good. I almost never die and have no problem killing any enemy and can solo the queen/imposter. If you can get a good JE heavy gun, probably a JE .50 cal or lmg and can keep up with ammo it‚Äôs OP
---
Well, wastelanders is going to give you some fun new quests to do. And there's a lot of NPCs roaming around. I highly suggest you fast travel as little as possible and run between locations because a lot of interesting things will happen to you or you will see new cool additions to the game world.
---
Other than that there's a dialogue tree, and a few new weapons and armor. But it still 76 so it's a buggy mess that has its moments. I think you'll have fun with the new quests, but if you beat the first campaign and quit I predict the same thing will happen with this one.
---
The only reason I play still is because I'm invested in my main character, and I made a secondary character to try out a new build. but doing wastelanders is definitely worth it, because it overhauled a lot in the game and made it a lot better
---
That‚Äôs interesting. This is the first time playing today but I definitely feel like I got it to work yesterday but if you‚Äôre right that‚Äôs sad news. It was nice gaining so much easy experience. If only they put more effort into this game.
---
No.  I play casually and I'm already rank 70 and will be done well before the season ends.
---
You clearly don't even fucking play the game you're whining about.
---
I'm selling for 10% of the price suggested by game. Meanwhile some ppl are selling for the full... I wonder how often they get the ka-ching sound, if ever.
---
I take it as I am getting FREE stuff. However, I agree it could be nice if we were able to do some "flexible" grind. Dailies are boring af.
---
I'm close to level 200 and I level daily with very little issue. Just doing my daily grind that takes like an hour or two at most. Hell finding the legendary creatures to kill is a harder daily.
---
I've been playing continuously since beta. Level 457. I'm still learning new thing. There's a lot to this game. Best advice is ride high level coat tails until level 75 so the quest line and other missions are more enjoyable and you're not getting hammered. Simply pop into world events and tag high level enemy and let others kill them. You'll rank up super quick.
---
I saw it in action this afternoon (on 7/25/20 CST time). Walked away in search of a different event...
---
I have an instigating hunting rifle that takes a good chunk out of it. Then I can usually drop it before it finds me, but that's now. When I first started going in there he got me every damn time.
---
It is free stuff yes and I would agree with you but this system is now the only way to get free atoms other than the challenges. So to get the cosmetics we actually want we're kinda forced into doing it. On top of that the atom gain was cut significantly, so I do feel the rewards should make up for that.
---
I feel like we should be able to find and kill her or tell her to stop making comments and just play music. If we kill her it will be a super tough boss fight or something
---
Disk? Not fair PC folk never got a disc! Imma smash my entire PC now!
---
Tbf the guy that made that video said he maxed his muscle sliders for his character so that may be why
---
Why can't we convert the lmg to fire 5.56
---
Oh that's probably it. I'll check with my other PAs to see if i can craft them
---
I've only once not completed it. It must be the people in your area/server. Sometimes it's only me collecting ore but with the exception of the one time, everyone seems up to the task of stopping the ghouls.
---
From what I can gather, once you swipe your card, the silo 'remembers' it for next time, provided you didn't complete the launch yourself (someone else launched it instead).
---
But even if this is the case, the OP would have to wait through the entire cooldown of that silo before they can try again. Or perhaps server hop, but then it'd probably 'forget' the card swipe and they'd need a new one anyway.  
---
Or else they could go to a different silo, but that would - again - require a new card.
---
So yeah, whichever way you spin it, it's unhelpful info.
---
Lol percentage-wise nearly 50% of gamers are women. You‚Äôve seen tonnes of girls on online games but since everyone uses things like RANDOMFARTLORD as their IGNs you just haven‚Äôt recognised them.
---
If you don't reach the end you are legitimately logging in so infrequently you may as well be classified as not playing the game, so who cares.
---
Yo someone really hurt their rep at Foundation by killing the mans.
---
Yeah if it still works it can be a little tricky like I swear even if it‚Äôs the right spot but rotated wrong it can not work. I tried to tell a teammate where to do it and it didn‚Äôt work for them but the next time the event came up it worked for me. I‚Äôm more talking about tents that are way off but still blocking the spot for other tents. I guess they could be like you though or unaware. I mostly thought I‚Äôd post this in case people weren‚Äôt aware or to here if people were actually blocking on purpose. But the other guy says it might be hotfixed.
---
I hadn't heard about this. What is broken about them?
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about that, now I gotta see if that works.
---
Dude I have had like that exact same experience lol
---
Fast travel bug, drops glitching out, empty legendaries - not to mention an odd lag I‚Äôve been experiencing the last few days... I‚Äôve got graphics turned down to potato and still it‚Äôs hard to play. My patience is running out with this game, man.
---
One shot those guys now but took me forever my first time around.
---
Only between the hours of 6pm and 6am though.
---
i had farmed 6k+ just doing dailies/weeklies before this marathon started so I actually dont know what r u talking about. i have 1st memb as well and it gives u 1650 atoms every month. i spent some atoms but i dont use all this cosmetics for camp. the only thing i like is a collectron.
---
He looks like he is about to cannibalize that corpse...
---
I haven't changed off this setting since that collectron was released. The royal jelly it gets is just fantastic to have.
---
I just don't even bother anymore, all he does is kill me over and over until my armor breaks. Not worth wasting all the materials to fix it for me anyway.
---
I started an alt recently so obviously I started from level 1 and people would boot me from the team constantly, I would also like to understand the logic behind this ridiculous act.
---
I was like that for awhile, but now that I can take him down I feel obligated to. He hurt me so many times!
---
This exactly. I spent $60 for a game I‚Äôve put 600 hours into, with more to come. The way I see it that is a crazy return on investment as far as entertainment. Compared to a movie ticket or amusement park pass, it blows the value out of the water.
---
I doubt I'll ever kill him, I'm too casual
---
Idk what they'll have in the next season but they should do outfits/backpacks instead of armor skins IMO
---
I'm pretty sure when they nerfed Super Duper to not work on it they also lowered the likelyhood of 3 stars and the likelyhood of the better effects.  My first crafts of gauss and SS when I had just gotten them were FAR better than my recent ones.  It's pretty scummy.  I've gone through 50 modules and gotten nothing worth using vs. 20 originally and getting 3 unyielding and several other good 3 stars.
---
I remember when they said you're gonna get gold bullion and scrip from it everyone on this subreddit was crying pAy tO wIn
---
You are incorrect. You don't "swipe" the card. You insert it. It is a one-time-use item. If someone launches the nuke instead of you, you've lost the nuke and the card. Even if you wait for the cooldown and are the first one to run through it again, you'll still need a new card.
---
I'm not sure where this notion that the silo will "remember" you comes from.
---
This game made me realize how nice some people can be, you guys are great thanks
---
It‚Äôs mostly from the redditors who are on the PTS. It‚Äôs called cursed and is meant to provide increased dmg for lower durability.
---
Im glad you are able to enjoy the game, I always wondered how people make friends in this game or meets nice persons, literally every time i log in the only thing that i come across is people in the voice chat being toxic and forcing pvp. Im lvl 98 and my friend list is empty
---
I don't know what you're trying to convey
---
All the vendors have a total of 1400 caps each day which resets every 20 hours from your first purchase.
---
So if I sell something at 12p, the next day, the caps reset at 8a.
---
1400 caps a day is the limit - and that 1400 caps is shared between all vendors - clean out one and you clean out them all.  If they run out of caps, you have to wait until next day for them to refill.
---
It‚Äôs tough out there in the wasteland for lower level new players and alts!!!
---
Agreed
---
That's really disappointing.
---
It does. You can test it. I put in a keycard. Put in my launch code. Went to launch a nuke and realized I was on a personal timer for that silo. Luckily my girlfriend was right beside me. She tried to launch and it required her to enter her own keycard. The next DAY I go back to that same silo (remember I never got to launch my nuke from my card) and when trying to enter a keycard it buzzed me and said I already had. Went to console and launched without using another key. It absolutely works like he said, try it yourself. All this happened last night/today it‚Äôs still fresh. Multiple times the machine has accepted multiple cards from us, only allowing one person to launch. The next time we go someone always gets a free launch. OP actually confirms this above.
---
so u actually dint know that wendigo is the easiest to kill mob? ghouls just run and attack dealing u radiation and melee damage. wendigo firstly stops to say something stupid and then dies there bcz his hp are not great and DR never existed.
---
Am I effing myself by opening the packs?
---
Nope you can only have a max of four as far as i am aware. Unless the new slocum joe vendor bots increased that limit. The player had all four vendors out in the open.
---
Honestly I hate to say it, I was there too and had the same feeling of turning over a new leaf. 
---
But with this new season debacle, bugs getting more prominent (a lot of CAMP bugs happened to me I'm salty about) and I haven't actually had good interactions with most players. I'm usually the one giving away stuff or helping genuinely new players. It's so frustrating because I used to play the Fallout franchise to get away from the grindy games but I guess it's hard not to find many that aren't anymore.
---
The moth man glide for our sins.
---
I honestly hate this challenge. It's such a pain in the ass to go scouring vendors for gum.
---
I haven‚Äôt been blessed by RNGesus.
---
Most of us haven't, that's why player vending and trading is such a big part of this game that most miss
---
I got a uny chest piece 2nd try today, ig I'm just lucky

Well yaknow, maybe he has a point, unending human suffering and disgrace of human rights is the same as making video game items rewarding /s

Who's to say what is 'right' and what is 'wrong' when it comes to a man and his chickens...

Man, until you surpass 1000 you can't join the screw hoarding club! :) 
---
I have a problem...
---
what legendary affects are on your gatling plasma?
---
I don't want to be the one to break this to you, but you don't play casually if you're already level 70.
---
That explains why Bessie doesn't mind, but I guess Jide is an even worse guard. He's never attacked me yet, must be too busy sleeping in his room nearby. :P
---
A long time ago, before they fixed the hopper in Mama Dolce's, I lost a couple pieces of T-60 power armor to it straight from the chassis I was wearing. I was SO pissed...  
---
The selection light kept jumping around, and it went to my PA instead of the container of stock I had my cursor over. And CHOMP. It ate them before I could stop myself.
---
The ‚Äúkill three legendaries‚Äù always pisses me off, it‚Äôs fairly easy to find a legendary if you know where to look but three? Really? I just want to do my challenges quickly and get off, I don‚Äôt have time to go on a wild goose chase for a 90% reduced weight axe.
---
Damnation Alley.  The book - not the movie.

Isn't dark matter anything but honest. Naturally. Or unnaturally. The mind boggles. Aliens are real.
---
I don't know why anyone would downvote this, that's real interesting and explains everything.
---
Junkie's, bullets explode for area damage, and +1 perception Gatling plasma.
---
Its a pack of joy followed quickly by disappointment.
---
They need real content the season should be background extra like a dessert or appetizer to a meal. The game itself should be the meat and potatoes -&gt; the community the ways you interact with people they just need to focus on that more. 
---
-Save states for workshops to build up places into townships where large groups can gather
---
- consequences for doing world missions. Example: you put up targets for a daily. Once that daily is completed on that server maybe have a target practice mini game happen? 
---
They will add the inclusion of bos but it‚Äôs just gonna be another static npc... add fallout to our actions based on our choices.
---
Just got it today, 100% worth it
---
Maybe, I'm not saying this is the reason for your unlucky friend with groups, but maaaaybee he has a stupidly offensive nametag. Maybe in another language...  
---
Or maybe not, it happens to me all the time with my 2nd too.
---
We've been seeing flying saucers since the 60's
---
Lol I'm not sure either but I also recall after this NPC told Bessie to initiate combat protocols after she did nothing the npc said something along the lines of "man I'm sure glad those don't work" or something similar to that
---
I got full unyielding suit by doing what I think is a system you can believe or not like many others. But I would always try to roll ss pieces when I got an unyielding prefix armor from any drop. It worked everytime but that can be my own perception.
---
‚ÄúTaly ho lads‚Äù
---
*pulls out comically large hydrant*
---
I think the season over all is hot garbage in execution. The rewards are disappointing but that is only amplified by how badly the S.C.O.R.E system is. In theory it could easily be one of the best things about 76 but the way they went about it is so poor.
---
There are more things they need to improve on besides the quality of the rewards.   
---
Fix auto complete daily bug. Its pretty odd that its been out for 3 weeks, they didn't test the score system and it has existed still during double score weekend. 
---
Remove Nuclear winter daily's. They listened after they got so many complaints against killing 9 AI. only to move it to 3 which was meh still time consuming then back to kill 5 AI. Listen to your community and don't make it a task to go out of your way to play a game mode you don't usually play and then hunt something you don't usually hunt. 
---
If they're going to make it harder to rank up in the higher levels (Which they should) they should keep weeklys instead of resetting them every week. Also give us a way to progress score without simply farming exp. Make events give score. Make daily quests give score.
---
Make the repeatable weekly increase how much score it gives as the weeks go on, call it 25 per week so its not OP.
---
You can gain max reputation with both no matter which side you choose. 
---
But also, make sure e you do all quests for each side up until you have to Mke a choice.
---
To answer your question shortly, no.
---
I have been playing since launch. I avoided Survival completely. Now Bethesda is forcing me to play NW and the worst possible outcome is emerging.
---
I am starting to like Nuclear Winter.
---
Dammit Bethesda how could you do this to me? The injustice of it all!
---
Todd is using jedi mind tricks on you
---
They don't.  I just leveled 2 mules and this is not a thing.
---
Also teams are pure ridiculous for leveling.  Got to 21 in a couple hours last night with enough scrip to get a 3 star from purveyor, all the major parts of the map explored, and over 3k caps.  Overseer was like, WTH dude, you aren't vaccinated yet?
---
Now to get 50 hiding in bushes doing the NW challenges and auto-completing Vital Equipment every day.
---
I completely agree, everytime I move my camp to a different spot, I get and because it's not I'm original spot I played with for 800 hours lol. I refined it, made it my home, and I love that
---
&gt;Ghillie armor skins and generic PA paint are meh.
---
Let alone not being able to use the ghillie skins in NW, it was the only place those could be legitimately useful. **Nowhere** else.
---
I agree with you, but I'm just addressing the lackluster 1st season.
---
You are a monster.
---
That‚Äôs wack.
---
... or you have a job/life outside of this game?
---
Well you can try but its always better to bitch so everybody gets unyielding ss armor on first try. Todd just told me we all deserve it.
---
This. I've done every daily and weekly thus far, plus grinded out the repeatable several times early on to get a head start, and I just hit 65.
---
It is fun for me.
---
The ammunition industry's one massive sham to run you out of hillsides and forests to dump ammo into out of boredom
---
Come to Clyde's Plan Shack, where non PA plans never go over 50 caps.
---
It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs saying, ‚Äúpay attention to me, can‚Äôt you see me playing dead here?‚Äù
---
Honestly, I get that.  Same experience on my end.
---
Unfortunately not , but you can do the questline for the settlers all the way up to raiding the vault to get the stealth suit ( but don't raid the vault ) then go do the questline with the raiders before choosing who to raid the vault with.
---
That worth is again completely arbitrary. They inherently have no worth, people just arbitrary make up prices for it. And again, RMT is a symptom of an unhealthy economy. Legendaries worth a damn are stupidly hard to get due to how many potential weapons and modifiers there are, so there will always be people cheating the system to get it easier. Yelling to fix dupe exploits without addressing the reasons why people constantly look for them is as ignorant as yelling for less crime without looking at the socioeconomic reasons for why someone would attempt crime.
---
I think he moves at a steady pace while players require more XP as they go so will slow down.
---
I'm not going to calculate at what point you should pass him, but I think you're right and being behind him right now is still fine although not for much longer.
---
Even the carry weight is awesome. Now when I‚Äôm encumbered I join a public group so strange in numbers increases my carry weight even further!
---
I‚Äôm no good at pvp play so I‚Äôm not a huge fan of it. If others like it thats great but it‚Äôs not my cup of tea
---
Fed 76 has good suggested prices for legendaries. The rest is kinda guess work, but price checking here works... sometimes.
---
If you are so stealthy that you faze out of the material world and become a 'shadow person' trapped in a parallel dimension - you might be 'too' stealthy.
---
I dont really care if youre high lvl or low lvl doesnt really seem to matter, i just want a full team for the %xp boost...
---
Build not included? Power fist or Grognaks Axe.
---
But you can't go wrong with a Bloodied unarmed character + Unstoppable Monster + food and Chems. 
---
My unarmed guy is so powerful I nerf him by using executioner's knuckles.
---
I was too late sadly, is it hard to get reputation now that I can't do their vault quests?
---
My best builds focus on one type  of gun. 
---
A heavy can use one weapon for far away,  and a different for close up. You don't need a shotgun or anything else. 
---
Trying to secondary specialize just hurts your perks for little no reason.
---
At least since you are stealthed and they could not see you properly, they cannot claim 'sexual harassment'
---
People's challenges auto-completing, people not getting atoms from regular challenges, broken perks, and more crashing is about as bad as it can get.  I mean, if the servers caught on fire and no one could play, it would probably be better really.
---
what is wrong with atom situation? and who are "we" ?  a group of players who complain about just everything?
---
I would prefer preset nuke locations that get destroyed than nuke everywhere but nothing really changes.
---
As someone suggested at least they could use the burning effect buildings get in nuclear winter to add some kind of destruction effect. 
---
Right now nukes are kinda underwhelming
---
True. I guess it for variety. This is my PA/Heavy build. Anything you‚Äôd change or add?
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f644e58&amp;d=s01sq2s22s80sr2s32pe2e00eh2c72s12ip2id2a72s71l71lt2lu2p52ic4&amp;w=ij0
---
They're overwhelmingly bland and terrible. No, I don't want a ghillie set for each and every armor type... ESPECIALLY since (a) they're broken for some and (2) OUTFITS EXIST!
---
And for all of the bootlickers, er, fans who say "well it's great stuff and I don't even miss those challenge atoms"... great. I truly enjoy how the goalposts keep moving. First it was "stop complaining about prices, you can get all of the atoms you'll ever need from playing". Now this.
---
As someone else said elsewhere in this... "it's as if the right hand and left hand have no idea what each other is doing". All of this reeks of desperation to drag out a complete lack of content and make dreadful chores instead of gameplay.
---
I too noticed the lag disappeared when crafting on a new character, I think the more recipes you have (therefore the more combinations of ingredients you can make) the server craps itself  trying to load all those combinations each time you try to craft one thing.
---
In which case there is no real workaround, even on 1st and a private server it won‚Äôt help.
---
But as for what you said about grinding man, I would look at what you‚Äôve got and be happy with that, sure you won‚Äôt have the fancy guys those guys have but hey? If you get one at least YOU know you worked hard to grind it out. I would just say hang in there, don‚Äôt let duper‚Äôs and cheaters put you off YOUR gameplay experience :-)
---
FOMO for the gold and script cap and wanting to zilk as much as you can each day from it? I mean that's gated I think for balance,  so players can prioritize doing other things,  whatever they may be. But since the emphasis is getting legendary SS quickly, that's a lot of farming scripts and gold to do more than 200/150 gold/script each day respectively. Not saying that is wrong to acquire more.  Some days I have more legendaries to trade and hit script cap. Sometimes I forget to trade for the gold and have more notes than the 200 cap. But I wasn't on top of it everyday,  and there is slack for the casual approach. Oh well I may not farm as much treasury notes and use the leftovers tomorrow kinda attitude. Maybe the cap should increase with level progression. Say at level 50 it is 200 gold and 150 script respectively. Every twenty levels it bumps up 15 capacity.  Level 70, 215 gold cap 165 script. Level 90, 230 gold cap 180 script
---
I just log in every day to clear my dailies then pop off to play something else. Takes me about 30 minutes.
---
We get fewer atoms with the score system.
---
Builds. They didn't think to test all possible builds and make sure they were all equal? Isn't game tester an actual job title? I'm not even close to someone computer savvy and I can see they tested very little. Or why even put nocturnal as a legendary effect knowing it would only be useful for half the time all the while also knowing it's nowhere near as useful as literally anything else? Why does the hunter prefix affect the Queen as she is scorched? Lol lots of things are confusing!
---
Atoms, Chicken Coop and Fireplace are the things I want and I have to get a ton of things I don't care about before I obtain them.
---
Originally I could just do the dailies I felt like doing and if a chicken coop popped up in atom store I could buy it with daily atoms. But more and more games are removing our ability to buy what we want directly and jerk us around with a monetized gimmick to get it instead. Everyone is experimenting with stuff like these battle passes to replace loot boxes, which were games' first major way of not selling us what we want directly but got banned.
---
Also I wish it was +1 perk point instead of card packs, card packs are useless other than having gum on hand for daily, not that it's hard to obtain. Many dupe cards are deleted too from packs which makes their future legendary coin idea confusing to me so I'm not even opening them anymore.
---
I don't think it makes any difference in how much rep each quest for the settlers will give you ,but it will be a long grind and the suit is very expensive. I cant remember the cost off the top of my head but I'm sure a quick search will tell you.
---
Same here. As a major fallout fan who has played all the games probably over 2k+ hours, when fo76 launched I heard it was buggy, horrible, and barely had any content. Judging from the launch reviews, I was disappointed and told myself this is the 1st ever fallout game that i will not purchase. I was even going to drop 200 dollars  for the special edition...  Fast forward 2 years, I bought the game a month ago and already have over 200 hours in it... while its not fallout 5 and it does have its problems, I love this game and will keep on playing it.
---
wait they *confirmed* this? I know it gets a lot of attention on here (rightly so) but i missed that news
---
Yeah now that you mention it it only really happens on reddit. I just assumed my phone was acting up.
---
Back when they were first discussing it I swear they said it‚Äôd be 2 hrs active play per rank. That‚Äôs currently impossible, I believe
---
They should have had the wendigo boss event ready and bundled that with the season.
---
Atoms, but we could have both. Simply give players the choice between the two. I bet Bethesda knows what most players will choose.
---
Bullshit. I‚Äôve been playing daily active pursuit and am at like 54. No fucking way.
---
Do Wards daily and also the photo one from the overseers house and take photos of crater and sell them to Ward for a little extra rep.
---
This game has been a huge help for my sobriety. 6 months and three days what whaaaat
---
I just want the chicken coop.
---
Make a camp and build a stash in there. Some stashes are located around the world, but the one in your camp would be the one to go. (Or your tent if you have Fallout 1st).
---
I've probably sold more ultracite armor plans than any other plan.  Seriously.  I put them up for 20 caps and they fly.  People don't want to run though the Brotherhood quest line and do Belly of the Beast (even though it's much easier now) or are running mules that they never plan on doing quests with.
---
Look in the looking for groups on Xbox. Alot of people call out that their doing the queen which means there's an active nuke zone. Unfortunately there aren't very many enemies where everyone drops it so the other mats are pretty scarce there but plenty of flux itself.
---
Lvl 130, 200+ hours in and I dont even know how to launch a nuke....
---
I dont love 6 points of perc. Refractory always seems lackluster to me. 30 ER is nothing late game. 
---
Glow sight is very situational. 
---
You have bandolier and batteries included. Are you actually planning on carrying both types of weapons.  I personally dont see bandolier as worth it bc those Ammo are so light. 
---
Now 2mm ec can get heavy so I can understand batteries included if going gauss. Both just seems overkill. 
---
Alot of people use one gun army in luck to max out damage. You could easily take away from perception to help. 
---
Aqua boy seems very situational. It's a card I sub in at times. 
---
Lone wanderer seems worthless in public teams era. I'm always in a team. 
---
Class freak is a card that is really nice, but if you can limit your mutations to needs that 3 extra points to play with.
---
Anything for that sweet, sweet fiber optic and ballistic fiber
---
How is this an exploit? The ammo factory is freely available to anyone and blueprints arent exactly anti-game mechanics
---
And sucking my thumb
---
"Tony Stark built this in a cave, with a box of scraps!!" Totally agree with you on that, more knowledge and better tools equals more efficient methods. I know I could get more out of a gun if I didn't literally smash it into bits on the edge of the workbench
---
I personally think there needs to be a "Chef" perk that is the food equivalent of Chemist
---
Not from your new character
---
That would be the reason to carry the non-legendary junk we get. I am in the phase I just throw it away since it is only a bother when I know I get only a bunch of steel.
---
In the entire history of the game has anyone actually bothered to craft some Formula P?
---
No items are accessible from character to character. A friend can help you transfer, there are also world containers but there is always a risk that way.
---
At the very least, a setting that one can choose in the options menus. It‚Äôs so painfully slow
---
Can you not learn it by scrapping?
---
And... seriously, who cares?  It's like a painting of a stripe.  It's not really worth 3 million dollars.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm trying to get enough Perc to get all the lock picks so I can switch them in. 
---
I main an Ultracite Gatling Laser and .50 cal/Minigun. 
---
I have a TON of .50 and 5mm and fusion cores (I live in my PA) and will eventually use the Gauss Minigun
---
How does One gun army increase damage? By increasing limb damage? I thought that just made their limbs more vulnerable. 
---
I hardly ever do public teams (personal pref and I server hop so much)
---
Class freak is because I have Marsupial and Scaly Skin (I have Speed Demon but I know it doesn‚Äôt work with it). 
---
And yeah towards the end I had like 8 points left over so I put 5 in gunsmith so I can repair my guns to 200% and they‚Äôll break 50% slower. I didn‚Äôt know what to do with the extra 3.
---
Seriously, how can I fucking get them? The most I had was 10K and I bought a set of unyielding combat armor
---
With the amount of grind they have planned for us in the future they mine as well make double exp permanent. and the events will be double that.
---
I found that book (  canticle for leibowitz  ) in a second hand book shop years ago. It looked interesting - never heard of it before and did read it. I still think of some parts of it nowadays. I thought it was just an obscure book no one else knew about.
---
If you're asking about moving items between your characters there are ways. 1) have a buddy help you. 2) look around the map for other people and view their profile, if they don't have their privacy settings to offline you have the ability to join their game. So you can drop stuff on the ground like in the paper bag or whatever or go somewhere that has a non stash container without a weight limit and drop the stuff in there. Quit out of the game and change your character. Go to social menu and find the previously mentioned person and join back into that same world and retrieve your items on the new character. You know a crap ton of steps to do something borderlands 2 did years ago lol.
---
Well that's certainly an interesting take.  I'd assumed the complaint would be because bullion is completely useless since at 1700 per week people are already running out of things to buy, let alone in 30 more weeks.
---
I would in future fallout games love to see a millarty vault. Manufacturing,vehicles,weapons,armor and other military equipment
---
The strength perks allow you to easily swap between heavy guns, melee and shotgun. If you run bloodied, you can easily put a bloodied rifle on your guy and put on a few essential perks like gun fu, covert operative and concentrated fire and still do enough sneak damage to have fun with a rifle. I used to focus on one gun for my build but since the secret service armor and such, I focus on one character to play on
---
One gum army doesnt. I had something else written and erased it but didnt erSe enough. 
---
Gunsmith is nice but weapon artisan is what let's you repair to 200 but only swap that in. 
---
You only need 3 perc for all lock pick. 
---
50 cal or minigun. I'd keep what ammo yiu need on you and stash rest. Get rid of bando. Fill in bullet shield. Or do blocker instead. 
---
Batteries included is nice for cores and gauss.
---
True. I just have a lot of fusion cores so I want to use PA and I‚Äôm more of a Leeroy Jenkins type of player, Hahahaha so I don‚Äôt think a bloodied build would work that well.
---
Shared bank is a common feature in MMOs but of course FO76 doesn't have it because Bethesda.
---
If you want to pass stuff and you don't have F1st privet server either hand it to a friend to pass along or dump it in a container on a server a friend is on and then log back into that server and hope someone hasn't come by and looted it.
---
I've had the exact opposite experience, I'll jump into a random team as a level 300ish sharing tier 3 inspiration with some level 20-30s, and they immediately kick me like 70% of the time.
---
Also, thru hiker is sometimes seen as a very blah qol.... 
---
I quickly learned exactly what aids I needed and stopped carrying extra. Gained 3 perk points. So many agility or end perks that are nicer.
---
Scrap kits are useless in general. Even if I didn't have Fallout 1st I'd say that!
---
And perk card packs? Ugh, even on an alt or new character it's just utter garbage! Also 'skins' should just be bundled together imo, like all the ghillie armor unlocked at once instead of individually
---
if like me you messed up and diddnt obtain the suite, you can buy it from the settler gold vendor for the price of 4k gold for the suit and 1650 for the head.
---
You wouldnt love it, if you bought it for 60 euro just to see it was given out for 15 euro the week after, and you lost all your shotgun bullets because the game crashed right before the event was completed, making you have to grind bullets with killing mobs with melee weapon, then repeat with the event with the shotgun build you always wanted, just to crash again.
---
Ok thank you!
---
To be honest, even if you get the plan, it requires several pieces of stable flux in order to build it. These are high level items that need to crafted by collect parts in the blasted zone. You can buy them from other players but they can cost around 150-250 caps each. 
---
So, even if you get the plan you might not be able to make it right away until later in the game.
---
Level 170 here and I'm in the same boat.
---
I never tried a junkies rifle on a non rifle character but it may be similar. Definitely run blocker and ricochet. They are phenomenal for pve
---
so they force us to get skins and other stuff instead of only atoms we could spend on things we actually want. if that is ur point I got it.
---
Join some public teams. I was a loner and now I have a guy that I play with everyday and sometimes a few other people I met on the game will come join us. I met them all on public teams by just playing the game and talking in the team chat
---
I mean, its just different food. Corn soup instead of rib meat.
---
That's the way they want it to be though. They want the grind to be boring, that way you spend all the atoms they give you on ranks, and then buy some more, just to get to 100.
---
People grinding for internet karma on social media shitholes makes me sad.
---
God forbid you should have to eat 2 more bubblegum. Complain about shit that matters, not some fucking gum. I don't blame bethesda for not engaging with the community more than they do when this is the type of complaining they have to deal with.
---
theres not even any Raider armour skins, even wood, WOOD!, gets ghillie yet nothing for raider...
---
I'm just explaining the monetization method being used here. There's nothing to disagree with.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd swap in weapon artisan then repair to 200% then equip gunsmith to basically ‚Äúforget‚Äù about needing to repair my weapons.
---
Is bullet shield that good? I ask because I‚Äôve heard high DR/ER gets diminishing returns (I have 506 DR/516 ER) 
---
And right now I have ~800 fusion cores. And true I could keep like 10k of each 5mm and 50 cal and resupply as needed.
---
She kinda hot doe
---
I've been going ham crafting underarmour, low level armour, weapons, and chems for new players.
---
What did he say
---
Then your pump has a magic effect like bash on it and your gauss doesn't.
---
This was my biggest disappointment with Wastelanders.
---
Just that reddit titles have been messing up with auto correct but not deleting what it‚Äôs correcting.
---
We need a common paint that matches all armors like light black especially combat armor and scout armor.
---
Lmao
---
It is.  I was hoping for the mirror ball effect where fire flies light up the surrounding area
---
He's not a 'bad guy'. He is just misunderstood...
---
It‚Äôs not the fact that it‚Äôs bubblegum that we have to eat it‚Äôs the fact that they are continuously changing the challenges and there isn‚Äôt much consistency. Things like this become more tedious and just make the game more boring and kill any excitement you are supposed to get when doing the season. I‚Äôve already made several post about simple changes bethesda could make to this game so that it would be more enjoyable and feel more fresh.
---
It's a metaphor for the whole game.
---
During BETA i was around the trainyard north of whitespring, heard gunshots...saw two players running towards me, they didnt shoot and i kept hearing gunshots...Super Mutants were going after a sentry bot. At this point all i really had was a bolt action hunting rifle with no mods except a sight and a auto pipe pistol
---
I got my hits in but once the Sentry Bot died they came for me...killed them all by running away and shooting, VATS was missing 95% shots, running low on ammo, armor breaking but i managed to kill them all (i ran so far i didnt get to loot) its a pretty fun video i still have saved.
---
Other than that, it was last day of BETA i first teamed up with people. I led them to an SBQ fight (was lvl 20 by the end) at Mt Blair.
---
I still play with those then random people nearly 2 years later
---
Everything they do feels reactionary.
---
Atomic shop income down? Reduce the number of "free" atoms drastically!
---
"Player engagement" not hitting the required numbers? Make a bunch of chores tied to mediocre rewards with a strong sense of FOMO due to the handful of good ones being far in.
---
Patch bringing back or introducing enough bugs to get the pendulum to swing back against BGS? Double SCORE! Double XP! 25% off at Princess!
---
This feels like the bad mobile games I've played where only significant player outrage changes anything for the better. And it's a shame.
---
The best build in the game is the build that let's you play the game without trouble difficulty and maximizes your fun....
---
It's hard getting away from picking up everything you can get your hands on. But once you get to the point where finding legendary enemies isn't that hard, don't pick up those one star heavy weapons or if you do drop them off around the wayward or even the rusty pick itself. Can't tell you how many times when I was a newer player I needed just 3 or 5 more script.
---
how has player level got anything to do with what they sell. they could've mule toons at LVL 2 selling the best shit or LVL 1000 selling LVL 1 pipe guns
---
It's not hard to convert the stuff by just spamming space bar on PC, though I welcome the changes they said they would do for it.
---
That‚Äôs fair. Given how little we know of his backstory I was making an unnecessary value judgment on Zorbo. He might be totally cool.
---
Joining a pub team that's doing radiation rumble will net you enough loot to hit the 1400 caps from the vendor. Check your legendaries before turning them in with fed76 or something similar. Besides guns and armor, you can make quite a few caps selling ammo, stable flux, and basic aid for cheap to other players.
---
While agree I with you with basically all of that, my theory on the double score is different. 
---
They can't seem to fix the auto challenge complete bug, so they're hoping that by doubling the score, that it will make up for lost score for those the bug occurs on.
---
Yeah Season 1 of Apex was shit, imagine hitting level 80+ and getting a stat tracker...
---
Headlamps don't work, I tried to add a blue one. That's the only mod I tried.
---
There are 2 ways I do it.
---
Join a team,  put a few items in a suitcase at R&amp;R ( few people there) leave, switch characters rejoin team using the join team option that should show up.  If everything Is good I‚Äôll then do the proper move.
---
If you have FO1st do the same thing but in your private server.  I‚Äôve never had this fail, even after I got a blue screen I still joined the same server.
---
I did the same but I like it with my T-51 Nuka Cola PA a bit more.
---
Yeah, but it's been a while since I've seen it back in the atomic shop
---
I know this may be time consuming but would you consider using that site to suggest a build? 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
It only works with no armor or weightless armor.
---
Come play with us, Danny
---
I dont hate bullet sheild buy bando seems meh. To each their own.
---
Same here. I went by a CAMP the other day where a guy was selling some kind of ballistic ammo for 25 caps apiece.
---
I can whip my opinion together. Please remember that we all play differently though. I dont want you to thibk anything you have is stupid. Im just giving suggestions.
---
Your camp prioritizes whole junk over scrap and storage scrap over scrapbox scrap when crafting and building. 
---
If you want to keep junk safe in storage, you need to either list it for 30,000 caps in a store or put them in a display case
---
I feel crafting legendary gear should yield 3* like purveyor purchases, rng is more than enough of a grind
---
With this game, if it‚Äôs horrible it‚Äôs probably accurate.
---
I know but if I see what you think I can tweak it for my play style but still visually see your suggestions.
---
I routinely use roughly 50% of what the game says the item is worth (so something that says it's 100 caps, I make it 50, or more often than not, 49). I'm not in it to make money, and even if I spend out a bunch of caps on something myself, I make it back up in a few days.
---
I love when you try your best throughout the match, fight for your life, kill a bunch of enemies, appear in the top 10
---
and then some player, who was just lucky to find briefcase launches a Nuke and you don't even have a chance to escape...
---
Not a bug unfortunately. When your crafting it will take the individual items before the bulk even if they aren't broken down to their base components and there is currently no way to flag it as "do not utilize for crafting." Why they put those in game as anything but collectables is anyone's guess.
---
But why not just eat 2 more bubblegum if its "not hard" and make a post about something a bit more substantial? Drive the point of big changes that need to happen rather than constantly making posts that they have to trawl through about things that are barely a problem.
---
I haven't done any grinding whatsoever for the seasons, so to me it's just been a cool little bonus without much work. If I was actually actively grinding for this, however, I think I'd go insane.
---
I had 37 bubblegum for sell today.....
---
I sold out.
---
(Don't know if I should have charged 10 or 30 Caps for them.)
---
(Went 20)
---
I disagree with your analysis, so yes, there is. Youre voicing an opinion, which is, you believe they are trying to prod people into spending money. From my position, I have not been prodded, nor have I even had a single thought about purchasing atoms, I cannot say I share your opinion, and in fact disagree with it.
---
 
---
2% extra XP per point in intelligence.
---
I feel like I was getting way more atoms before the season passed I‚Äôve completed ever single daily and week there‚Äôs been to date.
---
On Xbox. Same story.
---
You can buy shadowed scout armor mods from modus. I don't know how black they get but that might be a solution for you!
---
Might just be a visual bug. If your looking at it in your pip boy it's probably there just doesn't show in your pip boy.
---
a mule is quite unlikly idling im adventure mode or even have a real camp. at least, thats my understanding of a mule.  
---
in general, i like the idea. with so many new players joining the world via game pass, the area around wayward is always crowded with camp, would be nice to see if a higher level player has his camp there.
---
The limb damage on melee weapons which can't target limbs on vats is mesmerizing.
---
Ah sadly the scout armor doesn‚Äôt have any cosmetic change depending on the mods you equip on them.
---
Lockpicking a government aid box not knowing it was considered stealing and immediately getting destroyed by some dude's mini nuke.
---
I‚Äôve logged almost everyday for minimum 1-2 hours and I‚Äôm 56.  His concept of casual is whack.
---
[NON BLOODIED](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f334e58&amp;d=sg2sq2s22s32sr2pe2c72ic4s12ip2id2l71lt2lu2eh2a04)
---
4 extra points to spend. Pick any qol like thru hiker or whatever really. 
---
Il be back with a bloodied version.
---
THIS! Although some people might stop doing damage after hitting the 1000 cap...
---
i dont know what you are talking about, that high quality skin has NO problems. NONE. you should thank todd that you even have a change to gaze upon its glory.
---
I made posts about the big changes and guess what no one gives a shit. I think it has max 8 upvotes and like 2 comments. Even after sharing it around and around still nothing. I made this account solely to write about how this game only needs a few things and it will be much better. 
---
And about this post. I never said I wouldn‚Äôt do it I am just saying that they need to be more consistent and award more for more work. They do the same shit in other parts of the game and if you call them out on it and get them to fix it the. You can point out the other areas and those can get fixed too. It‚Äôs not the fact that is 2 more pieces of gum. That‚Äôs whatever I have well over 10 perk packs so I‚Äôll be fine, instead it‚Äôs the fact that bethesda took the already crappy challenge system and made it the primary way to get through the newest content and didn‚Äôt bother to fix its issues at all. It‚Äôs about how bethesda time and time again neglects this game and if they took a little bit of time to fix some aspects and stopped focusing on filling their pockets with ATX money then maybe we would have something to do in this game besides chew fucking gum.
---
Are you looking at your pipboy to see how much you have? If so there is a common visual bug for currency tab that shows wrong values, usually 0s for bullion, possum, and such. Go to one of those treasurey note converters to see if they are still there.
---
Hey I have a question: neither in widowsapp nor modifiablewidowsapp does Project76.ini exist :(
---
1. I carry that gun everywhere.
---
2. Not trying to start panic.
---
3. Was asking if this was a thing.
---
4. Find it funny my friend lost that much ammo the very next day.
---
Known issue. 
---
That is the risk you take when dropping stuff on the ground or in containers. 
---
Use legitimate couriers. 
---
Use periods.
---
I've seen many mules with stacked vendors. it's not uncommon for ppl to set up the mule and go do something else for a few hours while their mule sleeps or rides a Mr fuzzy ride so they don't get dropped from server.
---
Just sell everything you find (you don't generally need more than 20 stims and radaway for example, so just sell excess ones), also sell all food and water, it's literally everywhere and you literally can't die from starvation or dehydration.
---
Sell all the chems (maybe except psychobuff if you use it to buff your damage all the time), you don't need them generally.
---
Try to farm densely populated locations,such as west-tek, national isolated radio array, huntersville and harpers ferry. Selling all weapons you'll get there alone will get you close to the 1400 daily vendor cap limit. Do that everyday and you'll get to 18k for your first serum recipe rather fast. The best ones to buy first are marsupial, adrenal reaction, healing factor, bird bones, herbivore/carnivore, herd mentality. (In that order)
---
Hell, I can even sell you one for half that price so you could start churning out popular serums to sell for about 350c (my usual price, believe me, it's good) at your vending machine. They go very fast and you'll get that on top of your daily limit. You'll be able to afford the next recipe in no time.
---
I like how we are now using 'Ward' as form of measurement for how annoying NPCs are.
---
Reactionary sadly. And yes, frequently they can't fix long standing issues or worse, the fix is a complete disaster like the DR250 debacle.
---
[BLOODIED](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f344f4b&amp;d=sg2sq2s22s32sr2pe2c72ic4s12ip2id0l71lt2lu2eh2a03eu0ir2la2)
---
Just a quick throw together.
---
Character inventory not stash inventory.
---
Can always buy something you know you will need eventually. Bulk adhesive or something. That will put some caps back into the vendors so you can sell. I know your not gaining caps but you are gaining something you will actually use.
---
Exactly
---
That‚Äôs what I told myself... I lied to myself and now want the fire fly thing. Someone help.
---
Personally, I think this shows the Devs lack of imagination...  You have a Space Themed Board Game, so lets ignore all the space themed content in the game and have you grind for levels...  
---
Where is the "Find a Jangles" challenge?  Or a "Find an Alien Toy" Challenge?  Take a photo in a Space Suit...  Find a Rocket Toy...  Take a photo of the Space Station...  Take a picture of the moon...  You know, Space things...
---
I am rather annoyed at all the "Level Up" and "Kill X Legendary Creatures" challenges...  And the whole; "Two hours of play to complete"...  On a Public Server, Events with Legendaries are both rare, think smaller toons, and have the misfortune of being camped by large toons looking to do the challenges.  And on Private Servers...  They take hours to launch at all...  The Bobble Head challenge alone took me almost 4 hours to complete.
---
Makes me worried about the Fall Game...
---
There's 1 rad on it, wither or not you got it from the Port-A-Diner, so...
---
ah yes the [quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt_5l9U4uhc) rewards in this fine season.
---
yes. Why? Well, the -redacted- are coming to appalacia
---
Lol right! Now you can do your damage then skyrocket to space while pot shotting the big lady and her mobs.
---
Looks good and I appreciate you doing this and for putting some perks that maybe meh in there. 
---
Just a quick question I thought adrenaline was still bugged/broken?
---
 the captain cosmos dark matter jet pack is the wrong color.
---
sell the crap legendary stuff for caps, if your vendors are out buy bulk lead,steel etc and sell on. still cap limits and scrip limits are pointless.
---
Yes. It is scrap to learn. Very low chance.
---
I lost 8 rolls of toilet paper and a shitload of screws to him
---
Yes adrenaline is currently bugged but I have to assume it'll get fixed.
---
Okay the free reward is bugged and they‚Äôll have to fix it later, end of the world.
---
I was wandering why everyone was joining and shortly leaving my building team. Did not pay attention to their levels though, at 309 at this time myself.
---
If I notice a lowbie (1-30) level in my team I try travel to him and see if I can boost their gear. Been dropping lots of fixers lately üòé
---
Based on my experience joining Events based groups lately, all but 0.001% of the scrap everywhere in the game will disappear, and what's left will all be useless shit like burnt books and .38 ammo.
---
Thanks!
---
Ah ok. I would‚Äôve put it there if it was working but once it‚Äôs fixed (and tested by players and reported fixed) I‚Äôll use it.
---
weird flex, but ok
---
Please stop flashing the public, sir, or I will have to call the police protectrons.
---
Careful what you wish for, don't forget how they ["fixed"](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/644013838706016296/708134356350402570/COAT_MEME.png) the ranger coat. If you think it looks okay in that picture put it on a [female character](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/653436693285699666/656661887659802624/unknown.png?width=314&amp;height=669).
---
The Mire, love walking there at night during rain storms. So dark and creepy.
---
If fun when things go your way, 2/5 games i got 2nd place (1. Because of the Scorchbeast 2. Because I didn't have ammo to kill the last guy.)
---
1/5 I won Because I had a good team
---
2/5 I lost Because I got ganged up on by a team, manage to only take one of them with me.
---
So its hit or miss. I'm level 85 now so its getting annoying to level up.
---
WaKe uP ShEEpLe!
---
I mean after 1000 hours who wouldn't get bored a little bit?
---
Because Bethesda doesn't want to work that hard. Snap tail Reeds, Blight, and Cranberries would be all i have basically.
---
I like challenges where i have to kill a certain amount like a couple days ago i got kill 10 ghouls. Maybe just make more of those...
---
Oddly enough... I tried to put the code in for my friend earlier in our struggle for flux. Wouldn‚Äôt let me, but he could since he put in the nuclear keycard.
---
I second "Earth Abides". It's a surprisingly realistic post-viral-apocalypse book but it has a very different feel/approach than FO. I also highly recommend Richard Mattheson's "I am Legend" - post-viral-apocalypse-with-vampires. If you saw the Will Smith movie version, all I can say is that the book is way better and much more profound, especially the ending (the movie ending was awful).
---
Octavia Butler's Sower series is also good. The first book is called "Parable of the Sower",
---
I stopped caring after level 5 and haven't touched the game since. Even then the ammo converter is trash.
---
was this on the ps4?
---
I got a 1* furious broadsider from SBQ today, and I was lowkey disappointed in my shiny new prime receiver.
---
Thats because you expect wendigoes to be wendigone when you go into their rooms.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Some may stop, sure, but ultimately it still needs to be killed before anyone collects, so it‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interest to keep going.
---
i posted on this last week, if more players post as they too find the jet pack is the wrong colors a fix might happen.
---
Pure speculation, but it would make sense if they introduced more stuff into the bullion system alongside the Brotherhood of Steel updates.
---
Maybe my math is wrong 
---
Explosive is 20% of the base damage of the weapon, so 50% of 20% is 10% so basically you get 30% extra damage from the Explosive effect.
---
20 seems like a fair price to me. 37 is a lot of gum!
---
I had an extremely similar experience. I pre-ordered and quit the game after my first hour on week 1. Now I've been playing like crazy for the past month and I don't have a clue why I was so hasty in the beginning.
---
please explain to me, how something like this can make it into a game that people pay for, from a company which has been making games for decades is in any way shape or form ok.
---
its not "free" you can literally pay to progress the season, meaning you can pay money to receive these items. you can "earn" them but the system is designed as a monetization method, and only very dedicated players will unlock them.
---
even the season itself is broken, weeks of auto completing challenges. in the end you are left with broken skins, a garbage ammo converter, a handful of random camp items, and rehashed creation club content stretched out with garbage filler content put to an absurd grind. the season is garbage though and though, and its shoved in your face constantly.
---
you can make as many excuses as you want, doesn't change the fact that people can see the season is shit.
---
Your camp will spawn at the same location when you join a new server, as long as another player has settled the same area. So experiment with camp locations that are not as popular :)
---
Just a reminder for anyone getting complacent
---
I‚Äôm just vibing with my sheepsquatch looking forward to the secret door, no ones making you use this stuff.
---
Cranberry bog can look so pretty when at the right time of day
---
As above, just don't make the mistake of building In a workshop and expect it to be there when you come back.
---
Only your C. A. M. P will be a permanent feature.
---
Not sure how many I‚Äôm at for modules but I‚Äôm 3 for 5 prices unyieldingly now.  I rock 1 life saving as well
---
they never fucking fix the broken garbage they put in the game. its not fucking free, people are literally paying hundreds to skip the grind, its monetized.
---
if its monetized, its not free.
---
Fun but still needs loads of performance and bug fixes
---
You mean like mine raft lol üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨
---
You had the same experience i did but in a completely different biome. I experienced my first wendigo in the Toxic Valley just outside Grafton Station, it was fucking terrifying, so much so i turned my happy ass right back into The Forest. Dont think i ventured out further until i was like...level 80? Yeah, i was traumatised
---
Best explosive are still shotguns because each pellet gets an explosion. Especially with Enforcer. The damage was reduced but its still good. I have a level 40 bloodied explosive Combat. Its if we're higher level than it would be extremely rare. Got it in Radiation Rumble.
---

---
I get more Unyielding, Vanguards, and Bolstering than anything. I have two full sets of Unyielding, one set is all 3*s, the other is 2*s. I just started experimenting with Bloodied build just after Wastelanders release. I also have a near full (4 pcs) set of 3* chameleon, full set of 3* Mutants which is highly underrated, and a near full set of Poisoners. I've been pretty lucky. I hold on to it in case we can one day trade or sell these pieces I'm not using.
---
Alright thanks
---
I picked up my own copy of 76 about... two months ago. Lol. I remember being really low level and seeing level 100+ players flying around with jetpack power armor on and freaking the fuck out thinking they were going to murder me. And lo and behold, nobody did and I've had several of those high-level people give me a TON of gifts- this one guy gave my bf and I these gift boxes full of plans for things and it set me up for a sweet sweet C.A.M.P. And thousands of caps it was really cool. It was really sweet of them and maybe they were just trying to lighten their load of stuff in their stash but I really needed that stuff and I'll never forget thinking that random person with the scary-looking level and gear was in fact very nice. Haha.
---
Ok thx.
---
noone is making anyone even play the game, its a non argument.
---
The lvl 100 bundle stuff is pretty good, although you can't actually see what you get in the bundle...
---
Also yeah scrap kits are kinda lame but my freind who just started playing loves them. Need to remember this game isn't just for the hardcore players. It's there to entice new players in and get them hooked, which I think it's doing well. 
---
They need to fix the frame rate on the board. And they also need to put some skins for weapons that haven't had much love. (lmg, unarmed, most heavy weps)
---
Todd shows up, pees on wooby. doesn't smile, doesn't frown. But, he leaves your camp alone
---
I know. I‚Äôm sorry to trail off. It‚Äôs all apart of each other I feel, cosmetics as the end goal and non tradeable items in an online multiplayer game stifle the game. It‚Äôs like there is no bridge to anything they Create cus nothing is connecting or sticking. no weight to anything. Just a bunch of timers and online shop that never glitches
---
Lmao I just saw your comment calling this ‚Äúfree dlc‚Äù and how the grind is more rewarding. Why are you changing your stance? Just to argue on the Internet? Just to hahaha Bethesda bad all the time what is it?
---
They are probably still trying to work out the daily auto complete kinks. 3 gum isnt hard. It is just them adjusting what does and doesnt work. There is plenty of tutorials on gum hidey holes.
---
then get your sheepsqautch plushie and hop along then, noone *made* you make this post.
---
Lucky for me, I have the proletariat-tron
---
Smiles creepily. Have you ever tried nocturnal? Maybe just use the ones you don't want for a bit. A small sacrifice maybe. Unless you run leader of the pack and get bloodied level 10 weapons. Guilty haha
---
16x the detail
---
Weasel also
---
Your system is a helpful thing to mention
---
Sorry -Xbox 1. Level 37 for NW. 220 for reg play.
---
And carrying that gun everywhere makes it immune from being dropped?  I've lost track of how many times I've been going through my inventory and a single wrong move left a weapon or armor sitting on the ground for me to pick up in a panic.
---
For all you know you did accidentally drop it and this mysterious hacker/thief that supposedly looted your inventory and then decided to give your shit right back to you was just a really good samaritan letting you know you'd dropped something.
---
Your story about the "same thing" supposedly happening to your friend makes this even sketchier.  What are the odds that of all the PS4 players, assuming this is even a bug exclusive  to your platform, it just happened to hit two people that know each other in a short period of time with no other people reporting a thing?  And again someone gets access to your friends inventory and the ONLY thing they take is one type of ammo instead of just robbing him blind?  And they didn't even take ALL of the ammo but just some of it?
---
It wasn't an analysis, there's actually a monetization model this game uses and that's how it works.
---
who does that
---
Flarwoods has three around the various houses:
---
One is in the funeral home, another in on the wooden crate between two chairs on the same porch where you find Miguel Caldera's holotape in a chest, and the third in inside the local Red Rocket station.
---
 If you don't find them someone else took them, just server hop and they should be there.
---
I recommend leveling and getting new gear before running it again. It should take20 minutes tops to run a silo with no glitches, and if you made it through the Queen‚Äôs mobs would have annoyed you even more.
---
Guys like that are jerks, though. I‚Äôm down for some friendly toxicity like nuking high level vendors who are way too overpriced, but this was just genuinely annoying.
---
Ngl, I only got this game because of the Captain Cosmos PA. I *loved* that thing in 4 and it's a shame they didn't pull in the gun for a skin. It was kinda the only reason to use CC.
---
Still disappointed the Slocum Joe's stuff doesn't have a doughnut mixer, tho.
---
Grow some balls...
---
The only thing I wanted from this season was the sink. :)
---
Wait until you meet the stalking/vengeful mothman, ran into that fucker at the cranberry bog I seen his glowing yellow eyes, I tried to stop to get a picture but the fucker immediately teleported right in front of me and I am not afraid to say I screamed like a girl.
---
I make it all the time. It stacks I believe the improved aim part.
---
Yeah I heard that explosion on shotguns were awesome though two shot isn‚Äôt that great since I heard it only doubles one pellet not the whole shot.
---
Unfortunately I think the problem is Bethesda does not and has never made legendary games. They make great games that are riddled with problems, but they make them highly moddable and modders make them legendary. That's where Fallout 76 broke down. They made a great game that was riddled with problems, but they prevented modders from fixing the problems
---
Thank you for your sacrifice lol. Very informative.
---
Thats my daddy.

---
Never server drop legit items, only scrip, chems, ammo.. shit you won't lose sleep over if you get a server crash
---
Why on Earth would you set your expectations to advertising hype? Do people actually believe promotional marketing speak and hype like that these days? Every product or service in history is propped up with flowery marketing bullshit all the time. You have to take everything with a grain a salt.
---
Now thats a rumble!
---
Just to add if you join a regular or NW server the private will reset instantly. Otherwise I think its 10 minutes or so before it resets.
---
Pssst...On top of Seneca Rocks, right above the vulture proto-scorchbeast, there is a stuffed panda bear next to a bush. If you're willing to move your camp there and place an item to delete the bush, there is a message written behind it.
---
I like Legendary Run yeah i don't care much for the caps and the other small junk. But i do like that we can earn cool camp items and PA also the backpack with the space monkey is really cool! I like competing against my friends everyday to see how many space we moved, it makes the game fun!
---
Lol
---
We could hope but even on their website it says they can't give you score or advance you on the board, I got hit with this as well but their response is just to report it to the devs and nothing else. Judging by the other post regarding this they are well aware of this issue and plenty have spoken up but the response from Bethesda is still, we don't care.
---
It looks like it, yeah.
---
Yeah that‚Äôd be cool
---
aaahaha looking though post histories because you can come up with a reason why its ok to put out broken garbage. GG ü§°
---
Well... we could say, we have nude peep-show in our camp...
---
I like the positivity!! I don‚Äôt love all the filler content but I feel like if they got rid of caps, and upped the amount of bullion in the board it would be a bit nicer.
---
And requires 
---
*drumroll*
---
A stealthboy.
---
dude says "  I‚Äôm no Bethesda shill" lmao what a crock of shit.
---
Should have offered a sacrifice to RnGesus
---
I‚Äôm just saying his point about it being ‚Äúnot free‚Äù is funny when he‚Äôs literally in the comments of another post arguing against what he‚Äôs trying to say now lmao. Also the GG and clown emoji really isn‚Äôt the trump card you think it is my guy.
---
I did that one time, and when I made the blueprint I forgot to include the letters. LOL... it was late at night... after a bowl or two. I never made another sign.
---
there is but we really need t65 hadlamps
---
Flatwood monster against SBQ, he take the whole control that was fun (and quick lmao he got nuked by everyone)
---
In fact, the lunchboxes are useful to level up wich, in the case you're a high level, is useful to get extra SCORE so they are more and aid than a reward
---
It sure is frustrating, I dream of this title having the same 3rd party mod support as Fallout 4 did, can you imagine?
---
Are you on pc?
---
It's 60% of the explosive at max rank so an explosive rifle gains 12% more damage at max rank.
---
Im here for the chicken coop
---
I've got two more blueprints pointing left and right that say "feel free to take some" for my resource extractors, since I generally find people are much less likely to take workshops I actually want to keep (like Hemlock) if I share my resources. It's definitely a pain in the ass making sure each individual letter is tagged, but at least you only have to do it once.
---
I came here to complete challenges and chew bubblegum... and I'm all out of gum.
---
Stumbling across this now, but to be fair, I did state in the video that portion that you are referring to are items that are not classified as ATX items but are recent data mines that I'm displaying. I made it clear that they aren't necessarily ATX items but data-mined items non the less. I'm curious to know if you feel the same about my more recent videos regarding the subject, I wouldn't mind taking suggestions from someone I know is a big part of the data-mining community like yourself.
---
&gt;regular junk stash (not my big 1st stash box)
---
Be aware that all CAMP objects labeled as stash boxes contain the same inventory.  If you put something in a "junk stash box" it can still be scrapped or removed from the basic blue box.
---
If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
---
Actually it‚Äôs not that difficult if you start with the sign, you can expand the blueprint I think it‚Äôs RB for Xbox. I‚Äôm not in build mode so I‚Äôm not for sure but I know there‚Äôs a way to expand it without selecting each letter
---
no, you look dumb dude, you cant come up with a SINGLE reason why its ok to release broken content in the season, then start looking in post histories for any possible way out of it. its obvious clown hours bull.
---
Just forgot to do it that night. LOL
---
Roswell was in '47
---
That's what I don't get. The legendary run didn't exist less than two months ago. They could literally just be doing what they were already doing before this even existed. All it is is another way to get some stuff that either never existed or you can already get. The only drawbacks to it are that if you want to get everything you have to play everyday pretty much and it replaced a way to get atoms. You don't need to get everything and  why do people put so much importance on atoms? You can get cosmetics and a couple kits you don't really need with them. Are cosmetics really the thing keeping you playing this game? The challenges are easier and it's all free and keeps me playing, that's all it needs to be.
---
HOW, I need to now how you did radiation rumble.
---
I definitely wish we got better gear for our troubles rather than getting heavy armor that weighs me down even more. I‚Äôve fought this thing so many times looking for the scorchbeast queen head and it still eludes me. I wish I could at least get something useful
---
1857 to be precise.
---
Im 4 or 5 spaces behind trying to at least be one behind or ahead before the end of this week!

I used to have all the Teddy Bears üòçüêªüêªüêªüêªüêªüêªüêªüêª

But they all got consumed after the displays were turned off because of that duplication bug.
---
I'm still in therapy üò¢
---
I never even defended the broken skins I just said they‚Äôll fix it, like they did with the screaming eagle skin,and yea I checked the dudes posts to see if he was a super anti Bethesda player that can‚Äôt be reasoned with. My post is saying that if you don‚Äôt like the rewards, which I usually see is the main complaint that you don‚Äôt have to do them.
---
Ahhhhhh.  I accidentally clicked it and now I regret it.  I was really hoping to solve that riddle myself.
---
Remember when they thought it would be a good idea to access the atom store from train stations
---
the absurdity of it is actually not far off from what happens in NW sometimes

people wearing T51b and hiding in bushes

he uses rifles; it might be ok!?
---
How dare you
---
I myself, have two accounts - and I just log in with both at the same time.
---
Servers only return certain effects.  Server "a" might have effects 1-5 while server "b" might have 6-10.  If you want 8 and are on server a, you aren't getting it.
---
Nope. 
---
In this game it is.
---
[Ward is Weird](https://imgur.com/a/ICXwIMH)
---
No, but you have to leave the vault for that character to be saved, so you can play NW.
---
Agreed! It would make it faster to get the secret service armor i want!
---
YES that would be such a great idea! It would make it sooo much easier for everyone. I wish they could do this :(
---
i asked you to explain why it was ok to release content in this state. you still haven't. and your rational for digging though post histories is irrelevant, youre just looking to confirm a bias and its bull. 
---
screaming eagle is another great example of monetized garbage being shoved out with no testing or quality control, only to get fixed if enough people make noise about it. dont you think things should be quality from the start? again and again its the same story, they shove garbage out, get called on it, and then someone come and makes excuses for them.
---
Returning soon. Whats fed76
---
I'm just in it for the camp items...that's it. All the rest can go in the trash because I don't give a fuck about them (excluding the TINY amount of atoms they give us...I'll take any I can still wring out of Bethesda...jeez.).
---
I just came back to the game a few days ago so needless to say, there is no way I'll catch him! ;p
---
Is this going to be a continual thing, reseting every month or was it a one off event?
---
[Pricing tool for weapons and armor](http://fed76.info)

Thanks! This should be handy. I have some old legendaries that I have to price check.
---
[https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/)
---
What's the matter with the screaming eagle skin
---
I sell for 10% as well unless it is a piece I would actually find useful. Then I sell for a little more, but even then it's not as much as I see some other camps. I don't even know what some people are thinking with the prices they charge. It's insane.
---
Lol. I want the chicken coop too üòÇ. I need it for my tiny farm in the cranberry bog
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs okay to release it broken but, stuff like the screaming eagle was released early on the PTS and by the time it ever got the masses it was fixed. I don‚Äôt know why were debating over the one broken skin when what I‚Äôm saying is that it‚Äôs ridiculous to complain about a bunch of free cosmetics not being what you wanted, I think it is shitty that the stuff some people payed/exploited to is broken but that was NEVER my point, it‚Äôs shitty that one of the 100 rewards is broken and I think one other weapon skin has a minor finger glitch but from what I‚Äôm hearing they‚Äôre 98.5/100. Also I‚Äôll reiterate I have from the start been talking about the content of the battle pass I didn‚Äôt know it was broken I watched the video, damn that‚Äôs tough they‚Äôll probably fix that next patch. Also what confirmation bias do I have?
---
It's more than just if you don't want to do it or not, the entire behavior of the player base has totally changed. For better or worse it has changed the game. Not doing it is totally an option, but that doesn't mean that you'll be continuing to play in the same way you did before it existed.
---
I've just started reaching the point where I can afford serum recipes, but I just can't bring myself to spend that much. The cost is almost prohibitive at this point. Not to mention I don't know what it will cost in mats to make them once I have them. Plus selling them for 300-350 a pop will take forever to recoup the cost.
---
Am I the only one that likes her? All the comments here are overwhelmingly negative
---
Uh, I was referring to the UFO incident in Roswell in 1947. What are you referring to?
---
Probably wasn't me, but I dump my stuff there all the time. Sometimes bulked material that I can't sell due to hitting the daily cap. Sometimes serums because why not?
---
My first encounter was pretty similar: found a mothman randomly walking around in the woods, I was 20 levels ahead so decided to try sneak a kill with my sniper rifle. Motherfucker also teleported behind me and when I turned around it‚Äôs face is literally all over my screen and I noped out of the game
---
You said u turned level 50 I have some free level 50 power armor if your interested
---
Nobody makes you. It's a choice
---
Any LMG with the Stabilized and Heavy Gunner perks.
---
Cuts through him like a knife through hot cheese.
---
Low key I just got the ammo converter yesterday, do you think I have any chance of getting to the chicken coup or firefly jar?
---
No, a two-shot doubles the amount of pellets.  You might not get the expected amount of doulbe-damage because only the base damage is used for the extra pellets, not the modified damage from upgrades, and the accuracy drops off quickly.  
---
Shotguns are close up weapons.  You'll have to play with it a bit, but even with long barrels, the damage falls off quickly once you are about two concrete floor tiles away.
---
Use Shotgunner (regular, expert, master), Scattershot, Enforcer, Adamantium Skeleton, Demolition Expert, Gunsmith, Grenadier, and Skeet Shooter for explosive shotguns.  
---
If you don't have the perk points for Adamantium Skeleton then use power armour.  Otherwise you are going to cripple yourself with any shot close to you.  Another option would be to have multiple less-limb-damage armour pieces, but it's a bit of a waste of legendary armour attributes since it will only be needed when you are using shotguns.
---
Gunsmith is needed because explosive shotguns break quickly, even when using Gunsmith.  The best advice is to have multiple explosive shotguns so that you can switch when one breaks.  That or have a lot of repair kits on you.
---
The best shotguns are the Quad Double Barrel with faster-fire rate or faster-reload and the combat shotgun (due to it's higher ammo capacity and rate of fire).  The rest tend to be too slow and need to be reloaded way to often.  
---
The combat shotgun is my go-to weapon for crippling glowing ghouls at a Nuked Whitesprings, etc.  It also works great on Sheepsquatch (not the robot one), Deathclaws, etc.
---
Finally, buy shotgun shells at 1c a piece from player vendors.  It's cheaper than making them as you'll waste a lot of time trying to farm enough plastic.  I was always able to find them at this price.
---
Fair
---
Tell you what I have not found or seen a single medic or vamp shotty in weeks of searching. Feel bad for your loss!
---
FFS can I get a damn Combat Shotgun skin already???
---
I‚Äôm sorry am I a bad person for sitting here laughing just imagining this all going down?
---
Personally, I do like some of the C.A.M.P. objects, and would hate to lose out on those in the next season, but all in all, I'm afraid I won't be able to push myself to work for as many hours a day (2-3 hours if I'd rather play 20-30 minutes and go do something else that particular day) as I am doing right now to get through 100 levels of the next season, if the rewards are similar. Maybe if the PA/armor/weapon skins were enticing as well (for me, they're not at all this season), then losing out on them would feel bad enough to force me to play.
---
However, if it comes to that, and I'm going to feel like I'm forced to play every single day next season, then that'll definitely make me sour on this game quite a bit. I know I can buy the later levels with atoms, but that's a really shitty solution and would make me feel even worse about it.
---
I've hated daily quests and daily crap from the very early days of them being implemented in WoW, so for years now. I think whoever came up with the concept of daily stuff had the best intentions, but having years of experience with it, I can't help but feel that it's just a dumb, dumb way of creating content behind gating.
---
I for one wish that whoever is responsible for quest design and such at Bethesda nixes the whole concept of daily content completely, and buries it under a mountain of concrete. No daily quests. No daily challenges. No daily currency limits. No daily *anything*. You can still restrict stuff in other ways. If it has to be time-restricted, then make it like a month. If someone wants to grind 30 days of stuff in one sitting then let them.
---
If the system absolutely *has* to stay the way it is right now, then I for one recommend that the daily level up gets replaced by something much much faster. I can finish the daily challenges and still have 4/5 of my level to do right now, and I don't think we should have to switch to an alt to level up just do a challenge. Also, replace the overseer rank challenge as well. I think it took me like 7-8 hours last time to get it done, between getting grouped with people who deploy in the dumbest places and get killed within the first 15 seconds, and being killed 4v1 or 3v1 when trying to do solo games, whether I'm hiding in a bush or not (don't ask me how people can train straight to me and kill me from a bush when I'm inside of it in a ghilly, must be some hack mod everyone's using.)
---
As it is right now, yeah, I don't think the rewards are worth all this work.
---
magic effect medics... drool
---
If you're on PS4 I can mod your armor. It's one of the only combat armor mods I know.
---
If they let them back, they should have done full account wipes on them.
---
They really removed those shitty cardboard bastards.
---
I understand now. Thanks all. I was attempting this quest with 1 other player. I see now that this is clearly a team event. Baaaaaaaaa!
---
Yeah they seem to go quite post 5pm Friday
---
I scripped an AA E Gatling Plasma because the name is so long I thought it was something else...
---
Or meet the colossus
---
But they did not.
---
Pumpkin house candy bucket and perk packs. Easy. Plus I have the faschaut collectron going and that find bubblegum too.
---
I agree 100%
---
For me there was no bubblegum only gumdrops which didn't advance the challenge
---
That's almost depressing. My unyielding all rolled with combat armor so I never switched to scout before secret service.
---
Will literally be impossible unless you bend time.
---
Ya pretty weak. I‚Äôm about halfway thru it and think ima throw in the towel. It‚Äôs unfortunate because fallout is at its best when you are exploring the world and absorbing the interesting stories, not  scavenging flatwoods for some bubblegum or running the same event for the 100th time that has 0 effect on the game world.
---
Ah cool when does the season end?
---
I would say she's hit or miss with people, but looking at the comments I can say people just hate her. I think shes fine. She's no Mr new vegas.
---
Firefly for sure but the coop may be iffy. Depending on your grind and build. Pump the INT as much as you can
---
I hit lv 50 about two days ago! Currently lv 53! I too hated the game when it came out. I was a sucker and bought it on launch for full price and all the bugs and server issues turned me away immediately. About a month ago, I saw someone post fo76 on sale for PS4 and comments mentioned that the game was a lot better since Wastelanders so I picked it back up on pc and I fell in love. I knew my friends would enjoy it together and would be easily convinced by paying for their fo76 copies on ps4. Was able to get both copies for $10 and we‚Äôve been having a blast. They are current lv 40 and 36. We‚Äôve had some amazing times out in Appalachia! Hahaha!
---
Just another oversight that we‚Äôll get blamed for because we found it. All people are doing is blueprinting the ammo factory. Don‚Äôt do it at your camp, use a workshop, they‚Äôre apparently impossible to delete if placed in a camp.
---
Why intelligence? Sorry I really haven't bothered with this score thing I hate doing boring daily grinds but I also want those fireflies I'll put them next to prince
---
You can but the interface is odd and misleading
---
The wendigo rug is absolutely horrifying. I‚Äôve not yet found a camp built by someone mad enough to use it. Just the thought of someone dragging that thing home and turning it into furniture is bloodcurling
---
Whitesprings. Hands down
---
I‚Äôm not my last post was literally saying I‚Äôm canceling first because this game is too Buggy lmao.
---
i was able to fix it once by opening dialogue with Duchess, only worked the once though mind.
---
&gt;stuff like the screaming eagle was released early on the PTS and by the time it ever got the masses it was fixed
---
this is false, its "fixed" on the pst right now, but thats not live. you have this backwards. also atom shop items are not tested on the pts before release. the screaming eagle skin was NEVER tested before it was put on the atom shop. i dont know where you get your information from.
---
you said you were looking to see if u/TheToddPoster was "anti bethesda" thats looking to confirm a bias lmao.
---
youre acting like its all just tiny little blemishes and bug when in reality, shit is constant being released completely broken, again and again. if its not okay to release busted content, when why on earth are you surprised when people arent happy with it? the entire premise of your post is flawed dude, people should call bethesda out and give feedback not just except bullshit can call it a day. people arent just "complaining" that its not stuff they dont like. they are pissed because they cant even fucking complete the challenges to get the items, and then when when they do, or pay to, they are broken. its bullshit, full stop.
---
Yeah, it is an alcohol.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with the screaming eagle skin? I have a 2shot instigating I use with my commando build and haven‚Äôt noticed anything.
---
That's fair. I've been flirting with the threshold too. One trophy left from üíØ percent
---
Bruhhhhhhh this worked! You‚Äôre my hero!
---
The SS Jetpack gets nitrous when there's plenty of people around. I've died more often from falls during Scorched Land than from beatings of the Queen herself
---
If I had played it before Wastelanders I probably wouldn‚Äôt have liked it. Luckily Bethesda remembered characters matter.
---
I‚Äôm glad gamepass got me on board at the right time, good move
---
I actually didn't hate the game on launch, i was waiting until the waters were calmer before buying, because if it really was bad back then i would've regreted spending 60$ on it. I bought it 2 days ago on sale and guess what. I don't regret it. I love it. Already put 18 hours within like 3 days, Only wish my PC was better so i could play it on normal at native res. but otherwise, the game is perfectly fine
---
I swear I have never seen so many hastily slapped together skins in any game in my life. And not even for the season pass, there are plenty of regular atom shop skins with issues. It seems their motto is quantity over quality.
---
Yeah any time you grab an Ultracite vein anywhere it triggers the scorched. They come right to you. üòÉ
---
Or plans, I used to do that a lot when I was low level and didn't know much.
---
My thoughts exactly when I first saw they were rewards on the board...boy was I wrong but tbh I wasn't surprised when they weren't NW compatible..just yet another Bethesda trick for the lols
---
Yep not wrong! Bethesda should allows us to have a ‚Äúvault‚Äù that allows us to transfer between characters on one account that would be a great addition!
---
I also like her its just that one sentence i dont get. Bethesda could have picked any unpopular somg but they chose one of the good ones.
---
Is this an inside joke or something?
---
That‚Äôs twice now someone has said ‚ÄúHow dare you‚Äù when I made the same statement.
---
Bethesda removed those legendary perk from then cuz it wouldnt gane them any money from the atomic shop u know what I mean
---
I've never had a problem with private servers.   
---
A few things though:
---
1. If you are using containers, use containers in the main world, not in interiors.  I used a cigarette machine in the Wayward, then came in with my alt and the interior instanced because of the new team option when entering quest areas.  Fortunately I didn't lose much of value.
---
2. Cigarette machines have no weight limit and I have never had a problem with them, other than above.  I haven't had much experience with the other containers but it is possible that other containers are less reliable.
---
3. Never just drop items.  Always put them in a container or pass on to a friend.  If no one is in the world or close to the paper-bag, the paper-bag will de-spawn along with everything in it.  
---
4. Sometimes items will not show up immediately as the world loads, especially if you check right after loading in with your alt.  Also, sometimes adding an item will refresh the contents or cause them to load.  In other words, if your container is empty, wait a few minutes and then try adding an item to it before giving up.
---
5. Any time you transfer items without an intermediary, there is always a chance of losing the items.  An intermediary can be a friend or a second account running on a second system.
---
September. You could maybe make it half way?
---
I guess I had the details on that skin wrong, I saw a video on it a bit ago but everyone I know who has it it‚Äôs working fine, anyways.
---
One of the top posts rn is a dude saying he doesn‚Äôt like the content of the legendary run
---
‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt just complaining that it‚Äôs not stuff they don‚Äôt like‚Äù
---
I was talking to those people a battle pass fundamentally won‚Äôt have just stuff you like it‚Äôll be a lot of filler or stuff you just don‚Äôt use, personally I don‚Äôt use a single weapon or armour that is in the run. Whether or not you think battle passes are a good system of rewards in general is a whole different debate but we got one so... But back to the main point there are people upset that the free content isn‚Äôt what they wanted. I NEVER said anything about bugs the entire post I simply said if you don‚Äôt like the content of the battle pass just don‚Äôt do it.
---
Hope you're milking them first, I know I do. Perfect for running unyeild / bloody build.
---
Haha I might steal this idea if you don't mind!
---
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
&gt;after a bowl or two
---
What kind of ice cream?
---
Accidentally discovering Deathclaw Island in the beta with the discovery message coming up at the same time the Deathclaw started uprooting the ground. I was across the water faster than a jack rabbit in a time machine. Rest of the squad showed up and we took it down but being the first Deathclaw any of us saw in 76 up until then it was a experience.
---
And I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a specific mineral or if it‚Äôs any but if you nuke veins they‚Äôll turn into ultracite veins but they won‚Äôt dry up like a normal ultracite vein would, super farm
---
You can't just go around accusing people of playing Destiny all willy-nilly
---
&gt;this one guy gave my bf and I these gift boxes full of plans for things and it set me up for a sweet sweet C.A.M.P. And thousands of caps it was really cool. It was really sweet of them and maybe they were just trying to lighten their load of stuff in their stash
---
Who's gonna break the news?
---
Hot
---
Or start an influx of high damage melee toons that can 2 shot her
---
Cookies and cream
---
First: it won't take forever. Just about a week or so. People buy serums all the time if the price is right (and 350's more than fair). I once set the price to 299 and someone came within an hour and bought the entire stock. Made 17k in an instant this day.
---
Second: you can sell serums to robots for 500 with good charisma (unyielding armor helps immensely) and hard bargain perk. 3 serums get you to the daily cap limit. And then you just make extra profit the rest of the day selling at your vendor.
---
Believe me, you'll get to the point of buying the next recipe in no time and that will only widen the caps flow making you buy the next one faster. With 3-5 recipes you'll aready be swimming in caps all the time.
---
Too bad I don't have that collectron
---
I used default prices for most items to save time but nobody be buyin... 
---
I should have known to reduce prices because I'm a bargain hunter and I think most fo76'ers are too
---
worked for me and it was in Users\\Documents as well
---
I prefer explosive shotgun + Enforcer 3. Its just school yard bullying at that point.
---
I commented on a similar post the other week. It could be any number of reasons; some players may have different expectations, some might be looking for instant gratification and perhaps don't realise that they need to bond with team members before they see an increase in XP, luck or charisma. Others may very well be elitist asshats with a "squad" complex, who knows? I personally have not detected a noticeable difference in behaviours between high level and low level players in this regard.
---
I hated it at first too. Felt very grindy and pay to win-ish but as I got into it, I saw that real money was almost only for cosmetics. It did feel hard at first,  barely finding any reasonable guns early on but that's what made it really a SURVIVAL game. You get into game like these and forget that it's a post apocalyptic RPG. You're a survivor trying to get by on scraps and the game really makes you feel it at first. But once you get that first generator and clean water pump going, you realize, "This is how survival is MEANT to feel". I stuck out with the game, joined up in teams where I could. Random people gave me weapons, food, showed me little easter eggs here and there, filled me in on some Fallout lore and we split our ways. What people don't realize is that you can't one man army this Fallout straight away, like you can in the others. You need allies and I think Bethesda just failed to push that hard enough at first.
---
Now I've passed lvl 130 ish today and I still grind for legendary items, but mostly, I drop food to those who need it, my industrial water pumps stay unlocked for passerbys, and I have a vending machine full of ammo that usually go for about 1 cap each. I try to pay the help I was given back where I can.
---
For the most part, you need help in this game, and that's OK.
---
I'm at 20 tries with no luck getting the primary legendary prefix I want. At 2 legendary mods per try I'm a little annoyed lol.
---
&gt; The only interesting things from this season are the camp objects, lunch boxes and the Captain Cosmos PA (and I don't use PA).
---
So the whole post is just that your opinion matters more than anybody else's. Nice
---
I think the one think that makes me still like her is bc there are some sentences that never see the light of day. But then I get annoyed when she says the same dialogue every 5 minutes
---
You just gotta roll with it, buffout and psychobuff are pretty much fatal when they run out
---
Gonna disagree considering this stuff is free what were you expecting free camp stuff every level of course they were gonna fluff some of the levels, my only gripe with the fluff stuff is there should of been more scrip as rewards as gold or bullion is meh. With the actual good rewards how can you complain?! Ammo converter ( I know it's not working well at min but they said they are changing it) some cool looking campstuff and wallpapers, nice pa skins (not a fan of ghillie but each to their own) and that sweet looking backpack skin I'm looking forward to getting that one.
---
When mobs of robots would spawn inside the Whitespring Resort. I have a pic somewhere of me patiently standing at the check-in counter surrounded by like a dozen Mr Handys.
---
Other than that, can't top the first day of beta. All of us racing toward Flatwoods together in our party hats and vault suits, having no idea what we might find (spoiler: it was angry robots). I love knowing that I experienced something that can never happen again, that was the only time an entire server would be full of level 2s and nothing more.
---
I didn't know that my first marriage was for sale.
---
Same thing with the NW challenge, instead of bitching about it just don't do it. It's 250 score per day
---
Now... you aren‚Äôt planning on fucking those chickens are you?
---
The only way to get score is by doing daily‚Äôs and weeklys but you can do the repeatable weekly which gives you score per 10,000 XP you get
---
Thanksgiving dispay is an Atom shop item that circulates the atom shop from time to time.
---
There's that meter on the bottom tracking how soon he will move. I didn't count it, but it seems like he moves an equal amount each time. Maybe they made it so that it will take longer for him to move at later levels though
---
Eh nah schools about to start anyways and when it does I'll only be able to get on on the weekends and plus I don't wanna spend my weekends doing daily grinds
---
It will happen every few months and last just as long. The way they made it seem, they will be almost back to back with maybe a week in between
---
Given the game the best they could've done would be unique skins. Raider Gas Mask has the right idea, only too bad it's level 90 something. Ain't gonna grind
---
I used that forever. But my Junkie Explosive 50 Cal just eats things alive.
---
I used ALL shotgun based perks with an Explosive Executioner Pump, but in the end, the DPS on my 50 Cal. outweighed the DPH on the shootgoon. 
---
I can shred the Alpha Sheepsquatch in Project Paradise in seconds now and I've never looked back.
---
Crippling anything that moved was nice though. I do miss that.
---
*OH Matty!*
---
That's not good but also some people have had worse luck D:
---
Marine tactical helmet, make a few then sell them if you have a fair bit of rubber or glass. West tek or anywhere theres a lot of gun using enemies Sell the guns, line in the sand event is great for this as the blue caravan traders event place is just south of it. My personal fave is just stick a few water purifiers in your camp or a workshop, they fill pretty quickly and sell nicely at 5 cap
---
When I wrote my comment that one was playing XD
---
I sell ultracite pieces for 50 each and common jet packs at 200 each. I tossed all my mounted heads because I don't want to be associated with the dupers. They sell fairly often
---
Yeah especially with her whole "everyone goes through tough times" shit. She sounds like the Coronavirus commercials we've been inundated with non-stop since March.
---
That was after the gorilla glue
---
Naw, just like the old days! Wendigos runnin' wild again :D
---
It's just a poorly done skin, I doesnt look like they intended it for the handmade at all
---
the mag well doesn't line up on reload properly, due to handmades have a curved well, like AKs.
---
Sighting doesn't use the actual rail on the gun. Uses an early AK rail Adapter.
---
Caliber on receiver is incorrect.
---
It just looks like it was meant for the combat rifle and not the handmade.
---
Lol, it looks like some IG influencer's bad photoshop trying to look more curvy.
---
It becomes a race on who notices *Wolf Horde: The Forest* first
---
Beta had finished and I was in flatwoods at night so it was spooooky. I see a purple thing so I go to pick it for food to cook up when I see this peculiar plant has a health bar and is significantly higher leveled than me (lvl 30 oh my) and isn't a plant at all and is actually the flatwoods monster. So I damn nearly pissed myself and I booked it for the hills. Good times
---
Just wow... Grinded and spent atoms for this reward alone, and there's no helmet.. Cannot even begin to describe how disappointed I am right now..
---
High Intelligence and the inspirational perk will get you more xp which will get you more score
---

---
That machine that converts ammo into points is useless
---
It's picking the ultracite (even though you don't actually pick up additional ultracite ore) that spawns the Scortch and sometimes a Scortch Beast as well.
---
The trick is that all of the Scortch that spawn each time have to be killed before the next spawn will happen.  You can ignore the Scortch Beast.  Sometimes a Scortch will spawn outside of the tree at the base preventing the next spawn.  Kill that one wayward Scortch and you are back in business again.
---
The main issue I see with this system is the SCORE/legendary system should compliment existing content. 
---
This is honestly a big issue with their release plans right now. They do everything in tiers. If SCORE, wastelanders, and weindigo all released at the same time? There'd be so much to do you wouldn't even notice the grind. But for experienced players, the SCORE system IS the endgame, which it doesn't feel like it was designed to be. 
---
I hope as they put in more reliable things to do (as in new content, not just a new reward structure), then SCORE will "go by faster".
---
Personally, I got to level 40 and then dropped off. Got tired of the grind, especially since its the same exact activities I've been doing for the past 6 months. Now I'm forced to do it all over again, why? 99% of the items are "replacable" by atom shop items. Sure,  would be nice to get them. But chances are there's going to be a new atom shop bundle/skin/item that I will end up wanting to lose, which means I'm no longer using the items from the SCORE system that I spent 3 months straight working towards.
---
Ohhhhh gotcha. And yeah you right.
---
Nearly 3 weeks after your comment and I encountered this bug tonight. Ridiculous.
---
Thank you :)
---
Ever played Fallout: Tactics?
---
Sorry for your loss, but sorry to burst your bubble... The lightning bug lamp is pretty.... Meh. Doesn't produce much light, if any. Looks cool though, just don't expect them to light brightly
---
This game has one of the best online communities that I've ever seen, ppl have been very friendly to me since day one  and now I do the same
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ujEbejephNM
---
I gave up like a week ago. I wanted the captain cosmos power armor but now I realise there's no way I'll be able to reach it.
---
Ah! Thank you very much. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Penelope was a big asshole who didn‚Äôt care about the working class. Her parents were screwed up, and if she had it her way, she would probably run Foundation like a feudal lord. I‚Äôm pro-House and even I would actually kill Penelope if given the option.
---
The whole season thing is optional. If you don't like the rewards, don't brother in doing everything.
---
Really, most challenges complete playing normally, so you can get atoms, caps, gold or scrip just by leveling up, killing legendaries or eating three bubblegums (really, Todd?). And also some skins people might use because it makes their armor invisible on most item screens.
---
I'm not trying hard, and I'm even skipping some days. Yesterday I got ahead of that ship, Zorbo I think.
---
Right, but my point is that the ultracite remained even after I mined it, and I could trigger endless waves of scorched by touching the same bit every time
---
Thank you so much! I'll keep that in mind. What's your IGN?
---
Servers have always 24 players. Less players = less servers, but you won't notice
---
Yes definitely!
---
Aaaaahhh ....
---
Some of the plans are exclusive (most studio 51 for example). But yeah I sell every single plan 11caps. Even PA ones. Too many ultracite stuff and prime receivers.
---
Does collecting the ore actually make any difference, I seem to be the only one collecting half the time.
---
Oh wow! Thank you!
---
Just recently learned that myself
---
LOL!
---
This...   I've been trying to do the same thing, gather some junk items (i.e. restored fan, for example) and was careful not to scrap them.  Look in my Stash after repairing guns, making bullets, etc. and they are gone.  At first I thought that I was just being forgetful.
---
So, yes, whole junk in your Stash is used first.  They need to be in a display or your vendor to be safe.  I wish that you could just mark items that you don't want scrapped.
---
....You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
---
What. Really? I feel so dumb right now...
---
The correct answer is 30,000 caps. It‚Äôs impossible for anyone to amass any more caps than 30,000 in one place at one time. I‚Äôve tried. I don‚Äôt know where the other caps go. There‚Äôs obviously some kind of wormhole that opens up when one collects even one cap over 30,000.
---
All it does is move one space a day and reaches 100 on the last day. His ship started far ahead of you because the season doesnt last 100 days. You wont notice too big of difference level to level but over time it adds up since it goes up 25 points a level. So luckily its not like its expontential growth between levels or a steeler curve. Pretty much means that every 10 levels you have to do a extra challenge to go up a level.
---
No you will need perk cards to scrap anyway.
---
Get em a gift card for whatever service they are playing 76 on so Xbox gift card or PSN or steam idk completely if it would be steam or you'd have to go through Bethesdas website
---
Holy shit I play spanish and it's the same kind of voice.
---
What a great voice acting. Because I'd fucking kill her.
---
36 rounds is with ammosmith on, it's 20 without It. So you should got waht you crafted with these perks.
---
So for your math, it's 20 * 10 * 1.8 = 360 this is for ammosmith.
---
And 442 - 360 = 82 this is for super duper procs.
---
Ah nice.
---
One extra intelligence point is 2% which means if your is boosted to 30 you will gain 58% more xp then someone with only one intelligence. Its possible to get it up to 40 but its harder to maintain.
---
You can create up to 5 characters.   
---
Create a new character to hold all of the spare legendaries that you want to keep (a mule).  
---
Since you have Fallout 1st, you can use your private server to transfer items using a cigarette box that's in the main world (never use one inside an interior).  However, there is a always risk that you might lose the items doing this so do a few at a time.  A way around this is to have a second account and a second system and have your alt join you in your private world.
---
Having an alternate character also means that you can script twice as much.  But make sure that it is at level 50 before filling it up with stuff as you'll also want to use it get legendaries from the legendary vendor.  If it's at level 50 you'll be getting max level legendaries.
---
I thought the fireplace door, fireflies lamp and secret service skin was good!
---
Yeah that's how warframe does their nightwave seasons and it's great. 10k (easy to get) points per level for 30 lvls and you're done. They also have a feature where if you complete enough weekly challenges, old unfinished weeklies reappear.
---
Take a pic of an alien while wearing a tin foil hat.... I think that took me 6 hours of server hopping xD
---
I'm almost level 500 and often in a full squad, in which case we're dropping nukes.
---
If it's just me, I'm down for all sorts of random events and prior to public teams would often just bounce around the map doing whatever's up. You get the team bonus from ANY event you do, not just the ones you do together. So if you wanna come do Feed the People cool, if not that's cool too. I have yet to be in a public team where we're actually doing stuff together.
---
If you jumped on my team, I'd have no problem with you tagging along on whatever I'm doing, just don't expect to get rezzed 12 times and don't get mad if I one-shot stuff. Even better, get on mic so we can coordinate and make sure you get your hits in.
---
I'm too lazy to set prices so I go with the MSRP. I thought for sure I was being pranked today when a notification came up that someone bought one of my many copies of the ultracite left arm. They then went on to buy all the other pieces, full retail.
---
I only play it to unlock reward stuff, otherwise it‚Äôs a waste of time. Not because of hackers, it‚Äôs nothing but my luck vs your luck, everything else doesn‚Äôt matter which makes it too predictable and boring.
---
Yeah so it's 36x10 for 360 rounds and also when super duper procs it's only  for the original amount of 20 not what ammosmith gives so every time it goes off it adds the base 20
---
Managed all of them bar the NW one in 50 mins yesterday. Switched to an alt character to get the level up to save some time.
---
My unyielding armor was a mix of different pieces of combat, leather, forest scout, and metal, all mismatched and some under leveled. Then one day I decided to get together a matching set of unyielding cause I was sick of looking at my horrid set. I decided to get a full set of unyielding urban scout armor since the FO1st scout skin came out, plus I already had one of those rare urban scout masks to go with it. So I bought enough UNY Urban pieces from the market for like 5k each, mostly 1* pieces but it‚Äôs better to finally have a full matching set than what I had before.
---
(Haven‚Äôt done the Wastelanders storyline yet so I haven‚Äôt even touched the SS stuff yet, But I think I‚Äôll stick with my scout set. Secret Service armor kinda looks a little ugly for my tastes and I heard they don‚Äôt have deep pocketed or shielded for the Underarmor.)
---
I‚Äôm just fed up with the daily 3 legendaries for the third time in a row - was glad it wasn‚Äôt thee tiday
---
Bloodied is best for pve, but junkies is better pvp wise. My opinion atleast
---
You'll find &gt;!Jack!&lt; in the maze....
---
The underarmor has mods now, but only the chest piece has deep pockets
---
It's honestly weird. Today i wanted to try and see if it really "worked", i just put my tent near a tree, not even following a tutorial or trying to make it work and it worked for some reason.
---
Another day older and deeper in debt...
---
Sell now that they are still worth something.
---
After A Colossal Problem hits they won't be as valuable.
---
I have 2 main characters and others are mules.
---
A post was made similar to this a couple days ago Complaining. And I think Bethesda replied ‚ÄúDodge the bullet next time‚Äù
---
Battle royale games are tough tough. Go try other ones and see if u win on first try. Or maybe try to figure out how the other guy killed you.
---
I always build mine off the side of a cliff so I could potentially make a seven story building if I felt so inclined. I just built a really cool camp for my alt that has 4 small buildings running down the side of a cliff, one for a bar, a tv room, and a few small guest bedrooms and up top I have my greenhouse with a huge Astro turf lawn and my backwoods bungalow room.  I usually build a new one every couple weeks and have become addicted to camp building and this one is my favorite
---
Ever get the scared farts...yeah...happens when you fire a loud gun in the underbelly of Whitesprings for the first time and get ghoul-banged. Not even Deadpool got big enough brown pants to hold that shit-storm...üòßüí©üòµ
---
How does removing a Legendary perk from a mask stop Bethesda making money from the atomic shop? Are there legendary masks in the atomic shop now?
---
I was about to say the same thing, the sound effects make it so much fun to use
---
I had a teammate go down in Whitesprings a few days ago, ambushed by a legendary Wendigo. I was able to cripple it, some ghouls who mobbed him, and stim him back up.
---
Every time I try to move on from Enforcer, I think of stuff like that and just hesitate.
---
Sounds about right to me. I log on every day and basically only do the rep dailies/challenge dailies. I get about 2 levels per day.
---
You can transfer a fuaion core like a pa part without anination, but probably you don't have the time to navigate during a battle
---
Math literally fucks us all in this game. 
---
At this point I feel like I'm being trolled by the Count from Seseme Street. 1...2...3... Unlucky rolls from the Purveyor for you! Ha ha ha!
---
i'm keep the fireworks for the new year that i gonna have to pass in the computer again
---
junkies is easier to set up as you literally just take a load of drugs. Bloodied needs unyielding gear and bloodied weapons are usually the most expensive. Junkies can be expensive though. 
---
Bloodied is the most powerful but on the downside you can get murdered by a level 10 ant. I personally don't want to ever run bloodied as i feel it would ruin my enjoyment of the game.
---
There are still cheaters around. Yesterday I decided to go in there and actually work towards that ghillie suit, and I immediately gave up after getting killed by flying aimbotters with infinite automatic shotgun bullets pieces of crap three times in a row.
---
My next build is definitely a farmhold. God I'm pumped!!
---
Until fixed you can use the replace option to change to a wall then wallpaper it then change it back.
---
The Mire: Lovely visuals, spooky because you can encounter anything while you appreciate the view, and not to mention THEM COLOURS.
---
Savage Divide: great combination of all, good aesthetic too, the Palace of Winding Path is my favorite place so far in here.
---
The Forest: I love the building aesthetic in here, combined with trees it's kind of soothing.
---
Ash Heap: It's all black, can't see shit.
---
Well what's the point of selling face apparel if everyone is running around with a legendary mask you know that's probably the reason they removed them I think cuz everyone is running around with them like I'd understand if they were too add that and put a skin for the mask soo people would buy it
---
I see that's what peeps are doing with their Astronauts...
---
You're doing the lord's work.
---
If the game made people happy and efforts were rewarded there wouldnt be so much duping. RNG does not give out BE25 Handmades or Fixers but it does dish out Nocturnal shit with monotnous regularity. The lucky few with so called rare top tier weapons have a natural advantage and so the majority are pissed off with grinding for nothing thats why they find ways to dupe. Even ebay prices are coming down always a silver lining lol.
---
yeah, I started another alt just for the quicker levelling.  I'd probably be averaging 60-75 minutes this week if it wasn't for that bobblehead hunt yesterday.  I only do deploy CAMP challenges in NW tho
---
Not everyone min maxes. Some people hated the mask and didn't wear it even with the perks. Doubt Bethesda lost tonnes of money for it. It wasn't supposed to be legendary so they changed it back to match all other masks.
---
Hm Interesting... Might consider trying to get an uny set eventually if it gets full deep pocketed mods but I think I‚Äôll stick with my scout set for now.
---
(Out of all the armors I‚Äôve had, this scout set might be the most expensive one I‚Äôve owned... Cost me 5k per piece, then 11k caps to get the full set kitted out with Polymer and Deep Pocketed, the mask that goes with the set is one of those super rare drop items with a less than 1% chance to drop and it cost me 20k to get, then to top it all off I slapped on that Atomic skin from Fallout 1st which Is basically a 100$ skin. This was probably the most resources and effort I‚Äôve put into an armor set. I‚Äôm fairly proud of getting it all together.)
---
Yeah,that one and some others that were photo related weren't well thought out and weren't even worth the grind considering the rm value of the atoms awarded. But still Beth knows how to make their players jump through all sorts of hoops.
---
What exactly are you looking to min-max?
---
Overall it looks pretty solid. But perks are all about preference. Assuming you are running bloodied. With a full set of unyielding, there‚Äôs not a whole lot you really need. 
---
I play a 15 charisma shot gun character and still preform how I‚Äôd like. Most perks are preference, but what exactly are you looking for?
---
Bashing damage is one of the perks which, when on a weapon with around 200 fire rate, does much more damage than it should
---
Yeah I understand like what they should've done is kept it and had skins for it soo they would make sum
---
Is adrenaline still broken? I thought it was/will be patched on patch 20?
---
Yes, especially if they are hanging out from the windows, but it will never happen, its too complex for Bethesds to make it. Dirt tiles were a Fallout 4 asset. They just port old Fallout 4 assets into F76.
---
I feel the burn already at 70...  I can't wait for the grind to end. I honestly can't see myself surviving another season, even if they make the rewards actually good.
---
Getting my ass handed to me at wendigo cave, repeatedly. I still find it unnerving
---
I'd encourage it if anything! I never feel comfortable taking someone else's workshop, even when I'm 99% certain they only claimed it for score/plans. I'd feel a lot more confident if it was clear they didn't actually want to keep it.
---
Shits so redundant theyll probably add it to Season 2.
---
Thanks man, I played like 200 levels without knowing about Tenderizer so there's that. Anything to bump the damage really. And yah bloodied it is.
---
Well lets see, I can test it right now
---
‚ÄúHello, is that the fashion police‚Äù ... üòÄ
---
nope, its an issue thats effected PA too with other skins, and PA doesnt have any variation with the bodyslider. i tested it with skinny and fat bodies too, same issue.
---
Yuip still broken
---
I run 1 charisma (strange in numbers) and 5 intelligence (nerd rage+scrapper) the rest in luck. everything else is exactly the same. Looks like a great build overall!
---
Savage Divide.  Lot of sunlight, open spaces, etc.
---
Thought cheaters were only on pc :o
---
As both a 76 player and a Stardew Valley player, I am concerned.
---
If you can find flat enough ground it's got the baseless version in the build menu. However, the optimal ground is rarer than unicorns....
---
First one I encountered was in Berkley. I'd only just gotten to the point I could survive a bunch of mole miners so it went less than well...
---
Also managed to get killed by one on my first trip to Whitespring.
---
Wow. Patch notes stated it would be fixed. Oh well, that 5 perk cards to use on something else üëç
---
Hackers aside, I feel that a mode with rounds where you respawn after dying and in the end the one with the most kills wins (think deathwatch)..would have been less frustrating and more fun than this shit.
---
You cannot gift Fallout 1st unfortunately. But you can indeed either send them money or if it's someone close (like a family member) you can log in to their account and buy it while you pay yourself I guess. They should really make an option to gift sub tho.
---
I talk to people's Brahmin when they're away from their CAMP.
---
Sometimes though.... They're home when I'm in their yard.... 
---
O_O
---
The only way to complete the event is to collect at least 25 ore.
---
The collector is at a disadvantage for losing out on a ton of exp and loot, including several potential legendaries.
---
Bobblehead wasn't too tough but had to do it on private world, since the last bubblegum challenge I've saved all mine so wouldn't have to find any. Using my alt in NW gets me the level up challenge there too from just one game but honestly I'd rather not do them.
---
I've got to the point now where if I'm about to level up I'll stop playing and then log back in just after the refresh (5pm for me)
---
I've done that after I got annoyed because I was booted from another team. I did the whole Bender thing:
---
"I'll make my own team, with blackjack and hookers!"
---
Spoiler: No hookers actually joined the team I created.... a man can dream though...
---
Are you running a 0 ap cost auto rifle?
---
Other than that it might be good to run an extra point in charisma to get strange in numbers. Buffing Adrenal reaction, and eagle eye can be a huge help. Seeing how you don‚Äôt have gunsmith 5 equipped, you can prob get one at 2, move the int over and then you get the extra 25% buff to mutations. If you run in a team, there‚Äôs probably already sharing it so it‚Äôs not too bad. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have a 0 cost ap weapon it might be better to run grim reapers sprint over serendipity. Just to get a chance of getting your ap back and continue to rack up the gunfu.  But it‚Äôs all personal preference.
---
Well cosmetics are optional and you are forcing yourself to get cosmetics I am playing this game from day one and I only bought 5-6 atom shop item and there is no diffrence between me and the person who buys everything he saw at shop
---
What is Silt Bean good for?
---
But yes would be really nice! They could even make them Bullion items, special planters.
---
Yup.
---

Would you like some help? Xbox
---
Yah a 25 Fixer here, I hear that mods have been changed so you can't really get 0 ap costs with the right mods but it's still ridiculously low
---
I have my base in the Ash Heap for the Blight, not many visitors but I have my soups, me brahmin and me collectron to keep me company.
---
Beta day 1, when I first loaded into the vault with my wife sitting next to me. When my character woke up (who I still play as btw, level 239) we could hear the mics of people from all over the world, I heard German, English, American, and knew we were in for a completely different experience to previous titles.
---
This game deserved a lot of the hate it got when it first came out and I‚Äôm saying this as someone who loved the concept and liked the game. 
---
Even now there are some annoying bugs that really irk the shit out of me (like have to open the pip boy first before being able to trade with vendors). 
---
But the game has definitely changed a lot, for the better. I like more now than ever. 
---
But it was a mess when it launched.
---
You are just unlucky I got uny/poison/weapon weight reduction on my SS piece ad 5th try and you know what I got high hp build and I am just holding it untill I get something better
---
That's pretty much how my first NW matches ended. I see the guy... I shot him... he shot me... I'm dead.
---
Just play it again. Learn the map, learn where containers with loot placed.
---
I'm not a big PVP player myself nowdays... I use to play a lot CS 1.5 back in the day but now I'm kinda old, my eyesight is bad and my aim is shit.
---
Still I was able to win a NW match when I was doing "place a camp" daily. I was only rank 4... I read on this sub people just leave the match after they done with daily but I though "Nah, fuck it... I'm not gonna give up that easy."
---
I found the gun, killed the guy, took his chems, found PA, killed another guy who was trying to hide in bushes, hid in the bushes myself, killed the guy who was running nearby and didn't see me, 5 alive left in the match, waited for them to kill each other, killed last guy, win.
---
Nukes and dragons. Its a web site to character build. You can respec later, but why not figure it out before you get to level 50?
---
Slap some ultra light shadowed unyielding and your set mate!
---
Whoops
---
I like to take the workshop, drop a fusion generator and a few turrets for defense and just let the thing run, coming back every now and then to grab a few but leaving it unlocked for whoever. Plus, works for the take a workshop daily, lol.
---
No excuse im a bloodied build, I just get rid of my rads jump in a PA and collect. Once your done just tip over the threshold for the radiation, you'll soon be bloodied again in no time. You need at least 3 people collecting the ore. I'm desperate for the barrel plan so I just throw my build out the window just for a shot at getting it xD
---
Yea, I‚Äôd just try running with someone who has strange in numbers, and take some chems to really up your dps. Maybe even a magazine or two if you plan on extreme min maxing.
---
If you‚Äôve ever seen an IKEA store opening you won‚Äôt question their ability to instigate war.
---
Dont worry about builds rn just play normally and try too get someone too craft you a fixer once u get 2 level 50 decide wat u want too do heavy commando rifleman unarmed etc. Goodluck
---
Yet we all grind on lol
---
Explore the entire wastelande!
---
Come to think of it, my high school also has Vault-Tec‚Äôs colors, and I live in the same area the first game took place...and the school has a bomb shelter too...

The magazines &amp; bobbleheads are waiting for the solo Queen. Par 60 seconds? Bhah, let's push it to 30 seconds
---
Sadly this is true, its also why the PVP scene doesnt like Nuclear Winter, no aim bot, no duped/legacy weapons and armor. I still keep all my PVP gear and weapons I think might be good for PVP in hopes for a surprise PVP rebalance in adventure mode, and if they axe it completely like I think they are, I'll have a ton of script. But until than I get my PVP fix in DayZ, VATS is just so terrible for a PVP game, like seriously, an aim bot?
---
TIL it‚Äôs a thing with vein minerals. Nuke them and they turn to ultracite, you can mine them once but they don‚Äôt disappear...
---
Coincidence? I think not.
---
forever and ever...
---
Even on Steam, you can‚Äôt gift it. Which really sucks. Knowing myself, Bethesda would have a bit more money if you could gift it.
---
I didn‚Äôt. Your statement is a famous Bungie quote for Destiny players.
---
Does it go over fixers?
---
On me. I would love to display a Giddy-up Buttercup. I can make do losing 8 pounds in my stash. I even use the Giddy-up Buttercup icon.
---
They're worth 0 caps. You can't sell zero-value items to bot vendors.
---
If you see any for sale at a bot vendor, it's because somebody has sold raw flux to the vendor recently, and it's expired while sitting in the bot's inventory.
---
What's cavalier? I don't recall ever seeing it. Not even once.
---
Okay but that‚Äôd still be misleading. That means it takes a full day, since it can only be done once a day
---
I would rather have them a paid season but with actually good stuff in it.
---
They didn‚Äôt specify daily though. The current repeatable makes this nigh impossible
---
Literally came across a mule vendor yesterday, level 5 with fully stocked legendary armor/weapons, aids and ammo üôå
---
For pvp I would suggest junkies, though with junkies negatives I don't run it 
---
Bloodied, will help you die quickly from radiation damage.
---
"It just works"
---
There's a random spawn point near my camp that occasionally spawn a trio of wendigos. Not nice to come across unexpectedly in the outdoors.
---
When the game first came out and people didn‚Äôt destroy all the fun with broken builds and duped items. Back when finding a good shovel made you god
---
St. Peter don't ya call me cuz I can't go...
---
I was pysched to het the dark matter asking for combat rifle... attached it....it sucks üò≠
---
No problem. I think it's in the lights row that has table lamps. It's a cute light up globe.
---
On the other hand I got 2 unyieldings from 5 rolls,3 star and a 2 star. Luck can really be brutal and blessful.
---
Next time I run into a SBQ event I gotta grab my camera and load up on film. All my pics are scenic than anything
---
Neither rely on bugged damaged while you can.
---
psst try melee
---
Bos paint looks good on combat
---
It's nice but it's small and you can only build one.
---
I don‚Äôt even bother throwing my known plans (almost all) in the vendor. Takes up too much stash weight. I either drop them in bulk in front of Vault 76 or drop them to new players if I get the chance.
---
I did the math a while ago and got around 1 millions caps or 1 billion. It was a while ago
---
I only truly want the Combat Armour ghillie skins and the Giant Sheepsquatch, not much else on the board entices me at all
---
Pro tip: Use gun fu
---
Yes I also have a Bloodied gauss mini and it just sucks. You can‚Äôt use it against queen because it has explosive damage, and it takes too expensive ammo to use it against some mutants.
---
That makes sense. I've learned to display them ASAP. I'll just need to put them in the vendor ASAP as well.
---
Thanks.
---
Go to the camps of the highest level players on your server, you‚Äôll usually find expensive stuff for barely any caps, I know I don‚Äôt sell any plans over 50 caps
---
Hi there. I tried this a few weeks ago - launch platform and spring trap - and it worked really well. However today I tried it and every single launch, the game would rubber band me back to the launch pad. Has this been happening to anyone else today?
---
I bet your camp looks trash af
---
Maybe you can turn it in tomorrow without having to retrieve a new one
---
My level 6 mule had 4 machines full of average+ bloodied guns and pretty good Bolstering armor right outside of the wayward. I used to just leave him afk to generate caps for me. I also got my IE90 Lever Action from a mule for like 2000 caps
---
Always check those stocked up low level vendors, you never know what they're hiding
---
Or the next time that that is what he‚Äôs looking for
---
The problem is that BGS thinks those few cosmetics and other stuff are \*content\*. Thing is, it's not.
---
Guess I gotta wait and see
---
Definitely use [Nukes&amp;Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks). I personally like running 15 strength so I can alternate melee/heavy guns. It's harder to respec at higher levels so be smart with the perk points
---
\+1 karma for you
---
It quickly goes from perfectly reasonable to a complete slog, which is probably intentional since they're selling the way around that slog.
---
They get you into the mindset that this is something you're going to complete, then slowly make that goal less realistic for many players, unless they spend money.
---
They did add a greenhouse dome with no floor. So just put it where dirt is.
---
I thought it was because it was supposed to curb addiction and they messed it up
---
This happened to me.... I no longer have to do the quest at all.
---
All I have to do is go upto him and he responds as if I've already got what he's looking for. Very convenient bug for me. He's the only daily I do now because all it takes is me fast travelling to him.
---
The low health with bloodied isn't as bad as most would think. With the right damage reduction perks and some good armor, i'm a heavy build so i'm always putting my self out in the open and find my self rarely dying, with my health at 20% 24/7.
---
Wait until the last few days before spending the atoms (unless you absolutely can't wait to get the rewards) as you may end up earning them without atoms then you get the atoms too!
---
Maybe TANK KILLER is what you're looking for? Couple that with a perforating or stinging mag and you'll be ignoring a good amount of defence.
---
I think that in fed76 you have an accurate legend
---
Nothing unexpected. Cut out the free atoms you could get before to buy stuff you wanted in the atoms shop and replace them with 90% useless junk or ugly skins, with the other 10% having bugs and glitches or being average at best. This is the Bethesda way.
---
Its probably going to be a new theme but it changes resets sometime in September.
---
OP sounds like you want to convince youself. You now at bargaining stage.
---
There‚Äôs supposed to be a skill called Penetrator that gives No V.A.T.S. accuracy penalty vs. enemy body parts blocked by cover.
---
This..... I share gun fu in public teams so more people see how good it is.
---
I only use rank 1 as that's all you need.
---
Well fuck. 
---
I made a couple of the real life things with leds and they turned out pretty cool. I was really hoping for the same sort of thing in game. Thanks for letting me know so I wasn‚Äôt disappointed and for your condolences.
---
That would be nice, was looking for the insurgent and western outfits for so long and i think i wasted a couple thousand caps just on low level players, youre right it would help alot
---
Sounds like you had fun.  I love my Min/max builds but occasionally getting a situation like this is a nice refresher from the standard one shot. Gg
---
Ohh...... That's not on this game unfortunately.
---
Probably is on fallout 4 IIRC
---
Outside of using certain glitches. You can only have one effect at a time. Its been that way since release.
---
If you have been about to stack food and drink buffs without activity performing glitches then I dunno how you managed it but you shouldn't of been able to.
---
Hmmm very useful indeed I hoped it‚Äôs the case for me
---
I just unlocked the Ghile suit but can't craft it. Just doesn't show up under outfits with the rest of my ATOM purchases.
---
Are you banking level ups?  You cant really do that.
---
If you are level 51 and gave 6 unused points for example you will only have access to cards level 45 and below.
---
Andmy ultracite pa plans that are body pieces or mods for 600 caps or less can be dropped
---
Nope I‚Äôve used all of my level ups.
---
Giving us this day our daily eggs
---
That's on Fallout 4. Not Fallout 76
---
Mirelurk Kings the real Deathclaws of 76.
---
Oh okay that explains it. Unfortunately I was following a fallout 76 build that included that perk.
---
It's probably something they had sitting around mostly finished in the pipeline that they didn't think would sell well if placed directly in the atom shop.
---
I've been able to mine most but ultracite never and coper few and a few other like aluminum.. the ones I need lol
---
I mean, if you want something in it you do.
---
Luckily all I want is the Gatling gun skin aaaaaaaaaaall the way at the end.
---
So I just said fuck it.
---
Maybe next time Bethesda.
---
Battle passes aren't supposed to feel this grindy but this whole entire game is nothing but unrewarding grind with speckles of kinda rewarding grind thrown in.
---
So it actually fits in perfectly.
---
Ah I have 11 intelligence but I'm using the marsupial thing so however that affects it
---
Users ... putting 2 types of currency in the same vendor with this engine is a great bad idea.
---
Putting something temporarily unlockable on the game map permanently is a bad idea.
---
The ammunition converter interface is a bad design, but they have already warned of its redesign.
---
All the damage design of the game and weapon balancing itself is a bad idea ... let's hope the balance update if they do something, because it is sad that a tube gun does more damage than a mini nuke.
---
The reality is that designers probably don't have enough time to regularly play the game and see the interface and accessibility issues of regular players. Because reported, they are.
---
The truth is that I think that the usual testers (if they exist) of this game must have an alarming level of frustration ... or be authentic professionals who accept the decision of their superiors, of course XD.
---
FWIW - They're fixing the Fixer to use Combat Rifle skins for next season.
---
Fireworks are useless but the lunchboxes are alright - wouldn't buy them but they're a nice party favour. 
---
I'd also argue scrap kits are useless in general, not just for 1st - as more often than not if you're not paying for 1st you're going to up against the stash limit at most times anyway - I don't think I've seen less than 700 in my stash this year. 
---
I haven't bought anything from the Atomic Shop since the change to challenges either - it's all pushing too hard toward buying it now.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but it's really easy to "complete" Radiation Rumble solo, the hard part is actually fulfilling the objectives while you're at it.  
---
You need to turn in at least 75 ore to qualify for the actual unique rewards and depending on who you ask you also need all of the npcs alive.
---
Earlier on the bonus xp from the weekly was getting me up a few levels a day from doing SBQ but since double xp ended I've found it doesn't really help as much... Level 73 currently and return to work tomorrow so will only have an hour or so a day to play now anyway.
---
I just responded the question. I remeber that it has better stats but I have never used one. With 37 AGI there is no need for stealthboy.
---
That's nonsense
---
I also have my camp near the back of Point Pleasant, may mothman bless your camp brother.
---
That's what I heard i also heard it was a mistake
---
I usually just check to see how much ammo or plans their selling. If it‚Äôs a bunch Im sure it ain‚Äôt no low level. If they‚Äôre barely selling anything then yeah.
---
You have to find a server first in wich you SEE unyielding spawn on an armor piece. If you then start crafting your chances of getting an unyielding piece are way higher. I used this method and got a full Vanguard's set and some unyielding pieces for only 30 modules.
---
You as well brother, may Mothman watch over you!
---
As I sit here with both legs uny but still can‚Äôt get a chest piece
---
They haven‚Äôt for a long while
---
Not every rank can be something awesome, they need to stretch a season like this out over several months and that limits their options.  
---
The alternative everyone would like is that every single rank would have a new atx asset... but that's not a realistic or efficient use of assets on bethesda's part.  That leaves the alternative of padding out what rewards they do have by filling the in between with consumables and other currencies.  If they got rid of all the caps and bullion and scrip and kits they wouldn't be replacing it with more atom shop stuff, they'd just have to have fewer ranks and have completing each of them take longer to compensate.  
---
The point of having all of these little rewards scattered in between is that it ticks that "i got something" itch every day that makes you feel like you've progressed.
---
A friend of mine had a psychosis and won't get out of his house. Each day i log in and send him a fb message. We get in a team and chat and do dailies. 'Safe place' great to hear him exited time to time. I'm on holiday in greece and miss my dailies ;)
---
Nah that's cool, always learning something new. I didn't realise that, can you get enough ore with the excavator armour? Or can you double dip?
---
I've never managed to do this before so I'm still happy with my result. Got 3 legendaries out of it too because I managed to deposit enough ore to get to the next level
---
Let them be happy
---
I couldn't agree more I saw a camp with 20+ weapons, no offense to my man he was selling pipe pistols
---
How are  you "burnt out" by any of this?  Unless you're one of the people who grinded (and possibly exploited) the shit out of the system to already reach rank 100 you're not "burned out" by having to do a handful of minor tasks every day... that's called boredom if anything.
---
The xp bonus resets to zero if more than 4 get opened. As you can imagine with most being spammed at big events they've mostly been wasted. I imagine they'll be in the atomic shop soon.
---
My psn is ejstud if you see me around I‚Äôm by the back end near a wood pile near the nuclear dump site.
---
Too taxing on servers. But if i make a private and press e on a petrified corpse he disintegrates instantly. Also steady 144fps on ultra. In adventure mode it cantl take up to 3 seconds and fps drops in the 60's
---
You can't drop favorites anymore. Or sell them.
---
Good  imo they did somethings really good for example vats was a welcome change from the joke that vats was and is now effective enough I actually trust it
---
Just favorite them. Can't sell even a single stimpack. I have to unfav them first
---

 "Everyone else seems to have absurdly high level characters"
---
Hundreds and thousands of hours played. I have1130 hours in the game! Why the hurry though? You got somewhere to be? If it's a first character just enjoy yourself. Explore. Do the quests. If/when you level alts the yeah. Go absolutely HAM with the cranberry relish and bobbleheads and drugs. 
---
 "It's infuriating wasting 12 shotgun shells on ONE level 63 ghoul just to get a meager amount of xp for my efforts "
---
Wouldn't need 12 shotgun shells if you were a higher level. And yes. I see the irony there. But at a Higher level you have better gear and perks. Even level 40 makes a big difference. And 45.
---
 "but if I were to attempt to get to level 100 even at the rate I'm at it would take literal YEARS "
---
see above
---
the giant sheepsquatch plushie is also pretty cool
---
Oh it has more downsides than that.
---
I never jumped on the hate bandwagon, I was more curious about why people hated it so much, so when I got my Xbox One X I got a bundle with Fallout 76 and it has stayed installed and played since I got it. Recently got it on PC as well.
---
In the case of alcoholic beverages though, drinking a second one seems to completely obliterate all the effects from the first one.
---
So if I drink cranberry moonshine, which provides a bunch of buffs in addition to adding strength and then drink bourbon, which has different buffs but some overlap - cranberry moonshine disappears from the stars effects list altogether.
---
Whereas eating a bunch of different foods, say, gives you a list of effects. 
---
Definitely haven‚Äôt been actively performing glitches, I‚Äôve just been... eating and drinking stuff up to this point?
---
Jesus. Condescending much?
---
Are you fucking serious?
---
First off you're asking that they force us to go out and find specific space themed junk... people can't even get the fucking "chew bubblegum" challenge done without whining about how hard it is to find a stick.
---
Second if you're having ANY trouble with either the "level up" or legendary challenges then that's your own fault, because people have been providing tips ever since the season started to essentially trivialize both of them.  You can start a new character and have the level up challenge done in under ten minutes and there are easily spawnable events that have guaranteed legendary spawns, some  that even have all three in one go.
---
No one takes "two hours" to complete the challenges unless they're entirely half assing things and taking it slow on purpose, you can finish all of them in under half an hour if even that.
---
The bobblehead challenge was fucking easy as well.  Not only do you have guides all over the place leading you directly to the fucking spawns all across the map but there's literally a perk that makes them beep at you so you absolutely can't miss them in the process.
---
Thanks mate, i pass on getting it, doesnt seem worth it for me.
---
I tend to just look at how much stock they have overall. It's a good indicator
---
hey that's awesome man, great job!
---
It's just a guide. The "market" is pretty broken after the last dupe wave. Even settling things for 1000 caps can help a lot though even if it's allegedly worth more
---
Could that be due to Wastelanders?
---
Cheers. There's just so much to the game. When I did it I kinda wondered why others couldn't. Still wouldn't worry me if all but one npc died if I managed to get enough ore
---
üëçüèª
---
And yet somehow when scrap kits released this sub was once again all doom and gloom about how Bethesda was a bunch of dirty liars and the game was going p2w.  Now we're at the point where they're giving them away free and people would rather drop  them in a ditch than waste t he space.
---
Maybe a little bit...
---
&gt;n1NICKELBACKFAN 
---
Sweet man, i add you later if thats okay, GT is XIILOWEYIIX, made it 10 years ago i was a teen who thought the x's make me better at games haha, no shame in liking nickleback use to listen to them in my teens, still find some tunes catchy.
---
Amen to that!
---
I‚Äôm sure they are delighted üòÇ
---
To be fair the combat rifle skin is a Rare item.. As in you'll rarely get to use it
---
Yep. Just went in there for the first time yesterday. When the Wendigo popped up I was just like WTF and ran like crazy and ended up cornering myself and blowing through most of my ammo right then and there. I barely escaped but survived...then that bastard mirelurk king came out of NOWHERE and I was all out of ammo for my best weapons (of course). I have no idea how but I did survive, barely, and fast traveled the hell out of there!
---
Nope.  Ore is always one per point and although it respawns its not fast enough for a single person to collect enough within the time limit.  Actually reaching the threshold always requires at least two people.
---
Should you sell the crap legendary stuff? I was always using the legendary exchange.
---
The problem with the Legendary Run is that there is nothing else to do. In games with seasonal passes, normally the gameplay is good enough and varied enough that you will play the game anyway, and content is constantly updated so you keep playing.
---
In Fallout 76, the season pass is the content. Wastelanders added in a nice storyline but didn't really add anything in terms of endgame, repeatable content aside from three simple daily quests to do and one new event. The inflow of new endgame content is a trickle, so when new stuff like the Legendary Run comes out, people are going to be focussing on it.
---
Problems like how long it is, how grindy it feels, and how it's the only way to get a sense of progression in the game now is are solely down to the fact that there's basically nothing else to do. Had this update come out with the Wendigo Colossus quest, or with the BoS content that's set to release, people would be far more receptive.
---
As an aside, a lot of the rewards are kind of non-rewards. The atom amounts are basically just there to skip the level. Caps are a pointless reward. Even the power armour rewards aren't that great - they make up six or seven of the rewards, but most people aren't going to use more than one or two, and they're also the one or two that are furthest along and closest to the end. Like, you can pick up the T-45 one early on but basically nobody uses that. It's the same with the armour skins and weapon skins - they're very niche and it feels really bad if your chosen weapon or armour has their reward way down the end of the run.
---
her and rose are two big thumbs downs from me dawg. rose being my least favorite in the game for sure.

I have 2600+ hours in this game and my main is level 340ish. If leveling up is that important to you, run Bloodied with Unyielding armor. 
---
And shotguns are for immobilizing enemies, not killing them. Save ammo, beat them to death.
---
Coming out of the vault the first time and thinking...
---
What the fuck is this..
---
What the fuck is that 
---
And what the fuck does this thing do..

If you or anyone you know has experienced workplace injury due to Marion Copeland call 1-800-ROBCOLAW to join our class action suit
---
It switches targets too slowly to me. And you can get a almost guaranteed hit if you shoot just after activating vats,so gun fu gets in the way to me.
---
I'm sure it will let you hand it in next time. And the time after that. And that. And that.....

Yeah, i went into this season all gung ho, and the first few days were great.  It's only a couple of weeks in and I don't even really feel like playing anymore.  I have other games I'd rather be playing, but I've already gotten up to rank 62, so figure I'll finish this one out. 
---
If the next season starts up without a significant delay, I'm probably going to handle it very differently.  As they say, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.
---
It was always like this in fo4, you could only get the buff once or twice, I just assumed it was the same way in 76
---
I'm level 96 and I play casually. I also have the same character since launch, so that probs makes sense
---
Fog crawler hordes are also fun. Went to on in the bog thinking it'll be some easy fibre optic farming. Silly me.
---
Get a proper magic shotgun, instigating/50 limb/bashing damage/vats accuracy (one of these is enough) or modify a piece of armor with braced.
---
That will fix the 12 shots per mob issue.
---
Dam it Todd you had one job!!!
---
I know it's not uncommon for new/low level players, it was something that helped me feel better playing online games for the first time in a while.
---
Chur chur, just gonna grind for xp on private then.
---
Here have some calmex.
---
Coolcool! My ign is Toaru. What's yours?
---
Thanks. Had to leave the Vault before the option became available :)
---
Pointless,and by their standards,the leaves would cover the whole screen because who need to see?.
---
Its just me or most of those *toxic* stories coming from console players?
---
I‚Äôve got the power pack , have had it for ages. I just visit foundation each day, see him, quest done.
---
When it first launched and nobody had stupid shit like frogs legs it had a very old school CS feel to it. It could be a lot of fun if it wasn't for the perks system throwing everything out of balance and all the bouncing.
---
Was there glitch before you could keep turning it in?
---
anyone knows her location yet?
---
You can place the contemporary floors first then place the railings. Put at least two floors down. Once railings are in place you can delete the floor piece and replace it with a different floor IE Concrete or whichever you like. Boom, railings on concrete foundation. There is a gap but still nice. Only issue would be a second floor.
---
Lmfao
---
I don't know. I mean, the Ash Heap was once a beautiful forest but the Garahans and the Horwrights did that. All the riots over job losses was their a part of their doing. I'm not saying she deserves to die or be tortured, but she has a lot of blood on her hands that will take more than one nice deed to wash off.
---
This is a well known bug now, if you server hop you can even get the the free reputation but I wouldn't suggest you do this
---
he moves one space per day. He started ahead of us because there are not 100 days in the season.
---
I had to go get the item he wanted each day, but one day I just found a power pack while playing normally after I‚Äôd already done the quest for the day. Since then I can visit him and complete the quest every day without going and finding an item.
---
But don‚Äôt remove that power pack from your inventory ever or it‚Äôll stop working.
---
Yeah just think for a second how MORPG games have had safe and reliable ways to  transfer items between characters without the help of a third party for decades but for some reason we cannt have that in 76.    Not sure why in the hell you got down-voted.
---
I owe my soul to the Atomic Store...
---
It is so cute!! Was one of my favorite rewards.
---
Does braced mod also trigger the magic damage? üòÆ
---
Im about half way through the board currently and I kinda wish that the exp required per tile wouldve been a flat 2000. 
---
I dunno. I understand that there needs to be some kind of grind but its a bit much.
---
üòîüòîüòî
---
Oh I have Gun Fu rank 3. As I said, Gulper hordes are hard core. Quite tanky and perceptive.
---
Are you mixing up the Enclave? Blackwell founded the Free States, he was fighting for the people of Appalachia.
---
Not always but it's a possibility.
---
Definitely :) I ended up flipping the walls of my camp so it looks like its covered in stars. I wish it covered the ceilings too but either way, Im happy :)

in the main menu, after pressing play, it gives you the option to join either public, private, or NW, select private
---
Tbh I found much more exciting items in NW ... the only thing I really want from the legendary run is that fireplace secret door at the end ... which who knows if I‚Äôll even get üòÇ all the atoms I‚Äôm collecting would be great if there was decent outfits to spend it on ...I have a female character so apart from the nuka girl outfit ..there‚Äôs bugger all I wana by üòí oh how I would love irmas feather dress from FAllout 4 ... perhaps it‚Äôs a big ask üôÑ
---
I either one shot them or it takes 3 shots. It's wack!
---
Agreed, shhhhhhh
---
Coughtanagratowncough..
---
Yes, there is one about midway in the underground tunnels, under Wavy Willards.  It is in the open room where the generator is located, sitting on one of the tables in that open area.  (I know this challenge was yesterday, but I added this for next time, or even just for general Bobble Head hunting).
---
wtf we can ride the rides? my main character is lvl 110 and I have a second account i have to play with a friend who just started and recently started playing it on pc....and i never knew you could ride the rides.
---
Level up challenges are harder to do but easier to do
---
Those are the best! Got like 500 optical bundles from a single event - I'm set for life üòÇ
---
My issue is I have the worse luck of traveling to someones camp only for them to log off while im loading and I just waisted the caps.
---
It is 110% because of convenience and xp farming, and has absolutely nothing to do with difficulty
---
I got a few but also got poisoned a lot and thought better of it so just killed the boss.
---
I'm down to blast some SBQs
---
Foods or drinks *that give the same exact effect* will cancel the previous one. You cannot stack the same effect. You can, however, stack different effects that do the same thing such as extra carry weight and added strength.
---
Just like they fixed the Gatling gun drum covering up your crosshair in first person since beta? Just like the new Gatling gun skin actually makes this worse?
---
Should I make a guide then? ü§î too bad I'm no good at making videos worth watching.
---
I have 257 hours and I'm level 503.
---
I wouldn't worry about leveling up if I was you, just enjoy the game how you want to :)
---
If we ever get skins for ceilings I'll be thrilled.
---
&gt;Previous Fallouts had unlimited stash and weightless ammo but we're forced to either stop playing for the day or play without being able to fast-travel, run, or VATS much.
---
That's what people always seem to forget when they complain about camp budget or stash limits. It's not a SP game. It's run on servers which might not be able to handle the load. As for why not. No idea. Not a developer.
---
Dark matter skin on gun is a massive disappointment.
---
I was on my bloodied sneaking character, so I could literally hug them and they wouldn't detect me. If I'm on my PA character, I just kill the boss (or leave if I see others sneaking - no point to ruin their farm for a single legendary).
---
I played at launch and had quite a bit of fun, even though none of my friends really wanted to play...
---
I even bought the game for my brother, but he didn‚Äôt get into it.
---
After a while i quit out of loneliness/boredom... 
---
I think i got to lvl 60 or so...
---
My question now is... if i where to pick up the game again now, should i start a new character, or just continue my dude... I feel like with the addition of npc‚Äôs to the game, it has changed so much it‚Äôs better to restart maybe?
---
Interesting, I didn‚Äôt know that skin was working for a select few
---
Welcome in one of the best community ‚ò∫Ô∏è Sharing, supporting, and often so generous.
---
I thought so too until you get there and there's 10 level 5 10mm pistols and 4 pipe pistols
---
Hey dude I‚Äôve moved on to music production now however... Shoot me a message on Xbox stating you‚Äôre from reddit to kill queens. Well do that carnage tomorrow!
---
Did you not take advantage of the double XP weekend? I was level 199 and now 220 from it.
---
You can use buffout/bufftats and the like to get a STR boost, and then use radstag or ribeye steaks or similar for the carry weight buff...but yeah, the food carry weight effects never stacked as far I know.
---
You can stack multiple foods if they have different effects (e.g. Cranberry Relish and Brain Bombs can stack for a bonus to +XP and +INT).
---
Alcohol and Chems you can only have one of each however.
---
AWESOME idea!  :)
---
What would you recommend instead?
---
Its Paarthurnax's revenge for killing him. Another franchise and 7 years of difference? Won't stop him.
---
I actually have a non-legendary lvl 20 combat shotgun to cripple all the legs on the ghouls with as little damage done as possible and run around just gathering the √∏re. Unfortunately, there's not enough time for a single person to spawn minimum 75 ore to get to the unique plans üòï But it's fun to solo - you really feel the crowd control power üòé
---
Same. My camp would look so sick with a coop haha.
---
Forgive my ignorance, but why does one need the plans? The game hands you a full suit... maybe to make it at low level?
---
Edit: just realized that you could be talking about regular armor, I am referring to the PA. If you are talking about regular armor, then I am stupid.
---
this would break the weight management minigame which is like 80% of my daily struggle. what to keep and what to throw away? you can only do wrong...  
---
--&gt; no thanks, dont make the game even more easier
---
Smells like elitist cunts.
---
Yeah and with too much scripts running settlers stopped farming and you couldn't assign them anymore. If you saved after that you were screwed.
---
What do the lunchboxes do? I have a bunch and have no idea what to do with them.
---
Basically, this should work only on max leg. perk lvl, which, believe me pretty hard to achiveve.
---
"I see you have our missing property"
---
Don‚Äôt ruin the game for yourself by asking for free stuff
---
Too easy don‚Äôt need that kinda easy mode
---
Geez, I forgot to ask.  (sorry)   What is BGS?
---
Do the fireflies move around inside the jar at least?
---
Two shot adds one more bullet. It actually adds one more pellet only on shotguns. A quad double barrel is good, sure. An Instigating or junkie's combat shotgun destroys everything in vats :)
---
I only wanted the ammo converter so that's all I tried to get.. Everything since then has just been through normal play on double xp weekends. Bow skin is next.. Wooooo /s
---
People keep suggesting this as if it means anything. 
---
I've seen both high level camps with nothing but crap, way over priced or start level items, as well as very low level camps that must obviously be mule accounts with great items and deals. 
---
The feature you're requesting isn't as good as you think it is.
---
Fast travel less, and learn how to farm ammo/mats. If you're having trouble with caps for those reasons, they aren't going to go away with more time in game.
---
I used to be so scared of him ... until I levelled up my shotgun ... boom üí• 1 shot ... lanky mangled heap üòÇ ain‚Äôt so badass anymore are ya Wendy!?
---
iM nOt MaD aT yOu BuT...
---
&gt;a mule is quite unlikly idling im adventure mode or even have a real camp. at least, thats my understanding of a mule. 
---
That just doesn't reflect reality in my experience. I see it enough times that, while not common, it isn't uncommon either.
---
It will disappear out of your inventory when you log out, I‚Äôve found a couple of the items outside of the quest but they always disappeared when I logged back in. Apparently there‚Äôs a way to do the quest multiple times in a row if you find it before the daily
---
Edit: it‚Äôs weird that people were able to turn it in for the quest, I tried to turn it in to him but it was always gone when I would go see him after logging out
---
Never, ever use charging barrels on gatling lasers. Ever. DPS drops like a rock and they can't one shot anything. 
---
My main is a PA heavy using gatling lasers. I have both legacy and droppable versions of most variants. Long barrels are great. They kill things efficiently. 
---
Never use charging barrels.
---
I will jump in and defend a workshop if owner doesnt turn up then I can borrow it for the daily
---
Did he use explosive bait?
---
The logic in this game is.... well.... what logic, NPC with hatchet gives you a lead pipe when killed üôÉ
---
Oh no doubt. Just puzzled by that guy, as we‚Äôve had a fuck ton of raider stuff.
---
Ah thanks, didn't realise 36 was the increased amount. 
---
Shouldn't the 82 be a number divisible by 20 though?
---
I haven't been on recently but when I played it just cost x amount for a wallpaper pack. Once you had the pack you could use it as much as you like. But it was only a one time purchase sort of thing
---
afaik, word is that it comes with p21
---
It‚Äôs frustrating because they‚Äôre piloting this ship like it‚Äôs the first online multiplayer game to ever be released. As though there aren‚Äôt other, better run examples they could be drawing inspiration from. Even outright copying some systems from other games could be a big improvement. 
---
What‚Äôs most maddening to me is that there seems to be no-one on staff with experience of the creation engine. Not even one or two old hands guiding the bug fixes and QOL issues, and able to step in directly when a problem is too thorny. The number of times I‚Äôve seen modders on here, familiar with the engine, say they could resolve a problem in a matter of minutes is crazy. As a result, we get glacial ‚Äòcareful, careful‚Äô monthly patches, and no hotfixes for glaring errors, as the devs familiarise themselves with how it all works on our time. How, after almost two years, can we not have a ‚Äòcraft all‚Äô button. How?!?
---
Makes me wonder what they could do if they removed petrified corpses from the game lol. Been searching them since the game came out and never found anything but radiation. Wonder how it would affect the server if they made them static and they didnt explode with radiation when you got close or searched them.
---
deserves a ward.
---
 Someone to hear your growls
---
All right. Seems like on average you will be ranking up a little slower than once per day near the last few ranks, so it seems like the safest option is to get a few spaces ahead of him by then
---
I don't know what your problem is with gay couples. it really sounds like you need to relax though.
---
Just an observation, if you're at the no scrap and no bullets level you're probably just going to get your camp trashed again.
---
True, but often times you will see they have a variety of stock in many different categories. That‚Äôs always what I look for but you can still get bamboozled.
---
This may come as a shock, but there are people who play other mp games and do (and care about) pvp in F76.
---
Yeah, dumpster fire. Lol
---
Yeah it sucks
---
It's justinspired
---
I'm in the UK
---
YES!! Do it!
---
Why would you rely on VATS in pvp, though? If you find a worthy opponent, he'll just pop SB mk3; if he's a foodie, you can pretty much beat him with a lead pipe.
---
I have only become addicted to something twice in the game.  Once was when I was intentionally guzzling alcohol to knock out one of the challenges.  The other time was when I suddenly got that unexpected pop-up saying that I was addicted to Sweetwater's Special Blend.  That is some pretty powerful stuff that he produces!  That is why so many bugs and mongrels come running, when he fires up the boilers.  They are all addicted to it, too!  LOL  :D
---
Doesn't take that long for a skilled modder or dev team. But it would cause bugs with the incompetent B team at Bethesda Houston HQ. 
---
Fixing this game is not at their highest priority. Its mostly a cash cow and they usually fix bugs or exploits that would interfere with the atom shop sales and microtransactions.
---
I remember being in game when the nuke announcement went off. I‚Äôve never heard or saw one drop before. I thought dropping a nuke was insanely hard to do, since of course I was a low level and didn‚Äôt want any spoilers for the game. 
---
When the announcement started I was freaking out. I had to see it. And when it was falling, the music/sound that comes with it. I got cold chills. I was terrified of it. I was thinking about how this is what it was like for the fallout world. On that day the bombs dropped. Very emotional.. 
---
Had no clue what the SBQ was though.... not yet at least..
---
...but I‚Äôm mad
---
OP is talking about the normal stash box vs. the Fallout 1st scrapbox. The scrapbox from Fallout 1st is separate from the other stash boxes but only holds junk that's broken down.
---
The most competent brotherhood members in fallout history
---
Was just an example but ah well i find 1 cap in one of 50 ;) they could remove all junk too and add it to the atom shop ;) i like how it is. If i had 1500 stash space i still would fill it in a day (and i have f1st) if they made the vendors have 3000 caps and the scripscrap limit 300 i would make it.
---
They give a random buff plus 25% xp. The xp buff stacks up to 100% but if it exceeds that it breaks and resets to 0, even though it still lists it in your pipboy as 100%.
---
You literally said ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm not mad at you‚Äù....
---
Edit - spelling
---
This is why Allegheny existed
---
YUP!  With numerous successful transfers between alts, I have had one or two times where I suddenly lost the server, I could not get back into the game for a while, then it was gone.  I always try to only transfer low value items, or at least transfer only a few items at a time, if the aggregate of what I am transferring would suck if I lost it, but I would be OK with just losing one or two of them.
---
I don't get this complaint to be honest. Previously we got nothing to reward us for playing every day. Just atoms with some questionable quests. Now they give us free stuff basically, and yet there is people complaining. Why? I mean, it's a nice addiction and gives more  motivation to play. The system isn't perfect and we can all know acknowledge that, but it's still free stuff.
---
(I'm asking seriously)
---
more I think about it more angrier I getüòÇ I was really mad while typing that tried cover it little bit I guess
---
You can drop.concentrated fire to 1 and up critical savvy.
---
I mean yeah but we couldn't join the enclave if blackwell didn't go into hiding
---
Ah no wonder thanks for letting me know
---
The lower damage one is legendary at all?  Certain legendary effects are bugged and every pellet does full damage instead of all the pellets adding up to the damage like it's supposed to.
---
Yeah, the vendors it is what it is on the cap limit. With the stash, I have some legendaries I never use but like to have to hang on the wall of my camp. I think it would be interesting if there was a way to make items we hang up in our camp apply to the camp budget rather then stash limit but then if you remove it then it goes back to stash weight.
---
Does the non-explosive one have increased limb damage, bashing damage, or less vats cost as one of its legendary effects? If so it's one of the bugged "magic" weapons which does broken massive damage in VATS.
---
Does the shotgun have any legendary effects like 33%vats chance, bashing damage or blocking? If so this will cause the weapon to bug out abit and be alot stronger than it should be in VATS.
---
Junkies prefix as well.
---
Some weapons levels 5-15-25-35-45 while other go from 10-20-30-40-50. 
---
Get yourself as high level weapon that you can use. Pump shotgun is not good at your level as they go from 25-35, but Combat shotgun go from 30-40. So Combat shotgun is your friend at your level.
---
Use sleeping, Mama Dolces food and anything else that boosts xp and Intelligence.
---
Do events, dailies and both main stories (new and old). Killing for xp is good only when you can kill easily and fast.
---
If you find a decent legendary weapon with damage boosting effect, switch to that weapon if you can.
---
Didn't know that was one of them, thanks for the info.
---
Got to level 45 or something and gave up. Haven‚Äôt played in a week or so whereas prior to that I was on every day making sure I got every bit of SCORE I could. Think I‚Äôll be gone until Fractured Steel, or maybe the Daily Ops if they seem interesting enough to keep me logging in.
---
Be cool if they took out the 150 atom rewards completely and instead every reward is a choice between 50 atoms and the item. Don't want fireworks, then choose 50 atoms.
---
Nothing at the top of the highest Watoga buildings, either.
---
I am on Xbox.  I crashed at least three times yesterday.
---
lol. This skin is the only reason I even was trying to do the Legendary Run.
---
I now have no incentive.
---
Both legendary yes 3 star, the non explosive is a zealot that does 30 Extra damage to scorched ... but even moleminers and mutants get wiped out with the non explosive .
---
The explosive shottie is a vampire explosive .
---
Non have any extra vats damage ... even without vats the zealot is more powerful ... just seems the wrong way round .
---
no, I rarely visit my camp this time I just ran out of ammo after constant events, and leveling up, I went my player to bed to rest and regain health and this asshole comes and starting shooting I get up and went to my stash to look maybe I have a weapon with ammo, I had none he started to shooting my camp so I hitted him with hammer, my bad ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and he completely destroyed everything and started dancing
---
Just keep me busy until Cyberpunk 2077 comes out...    :-)
---
It isn't too bad. But I wish we got more atoms. It is bad how we casnt get them from dailies and weeklies
---
What are the other effects on the zealots shotgun, it will be one of these that is making the damage skyrocket.
---
I quit playing 76 for a bit and just recently saw someones camp with a chicken coop. So how exactly do we get that or is it not currently possible. Like was it a limited time event?
---
Ya, I've never understood the hate it got.  It's Fallout, with friends.  Shoehorning multiplayer into FO4 was always going to result in a buggy mess - but goddam if it isn't fun.
---
There is also a wedding ring there.
---
I don't find farming places like West Tek fun but as it's a means to progress I've been doing it. Not everyone likes the same things. Things like bubblegum challenges is just nit picking. If the challenge was fire a weapon someone would be on here moaning because they're melee.
---
Ah, ok, at least you know where you made mistake.  
---
Nnext time don't engage, but build a spike trap beneath the griefer. If he's bloodied, it's game over in a second.
---
Yeah, until they fix things. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If you didn't do the settlers quests, you can buy it with gold bullion from their vendor
---
This is what the BoS fanboys look from the perspective of outsiders
---
But I sided with the Raiders so how do I build my reputation with the settlers
---
I don‚Äôt know when that quote was because you didn‚Äôt include a link. 
---
This is what I have from February, 2019
---
&gt;	Next week, we are raising the Stash limit from 600 to 800 pounds. Like last time, we are constantly evaluating storage space and discussing ways we can make improvements, but not at the expense of server stability.
---
[feb 14, 2019 inside the vault](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019)
---
I‚Äôm not sure you realize this, but they‚Äôve done a lot to increase server stability between launch and feb 2019 that made that increase possible. They also did a lot between them and launch of 1st to make unlimited scrap possible. Unlimited scrap takes much less server strain than unlimited storage. This has been talked about at length on this sub, but it essentially boils down to how data bases work. 
---
Anyway as I said, I am against the scrap box, but it still wasn‚Äôt a lie.
---
Yea I was tired. My mental math isn‚Äôt as good as it once was. 
---
I wonder if it‚Äôs a bug or intended. They never officially said the 25 additional increase was for every level, people just kind of extrapolated.
---
Lack of repeatable content is my gripe most of all. I don't know why they haven't made proper dungeons that you and four other people fight through. The bullion grind turned me off big time. The game engine itself is annoying as well it's not very responsive so I don't feel any skill is required in combat.  Bethesda also continually lets me down constantly with their patches it's so fatiguing.
---
Yeah. get your rank up with the settlers and spend lots of bullion. It's 4000 bullion. 
---
If you had done both sides before choosing a faction you would have got it free.
---
Propaganda flyers and technical documents are worth one cap and are weightless
---
It is likely just your gear. If you're in the best gear or at least very good gear and using a very strong build (PA heavy gunner, junkies, bloodied etc) it gets pretty easy. The PA builds arn't as strong but they can be very very tough. A bloodied build with the best gear can just one shot a wendigo and make fast work of a Mirelurk King.
---
What I‚Äôm saying is I don‚Äôt know how to start getting a reputation of the sellers because right now I‚Äôm I‚Äôm getting rep with the Raiders
---
Great idea!   I've nearly done the same because the map didn't show a player's icon at the workshop....didn't learn it was owned until I got up there.
---
Thank you for the response and recommendations! I should clarify that I'm not necessarily trying to power-level or anything like that. Normally I don't care what level my character is and progress however long it may take. The exception here has to do with the way the game spawns enemies. As I understand it, the game will spawn enemies of different levels into an area based on the level of players in the server/near that location. If a level 20 player is an area, the enemies spawned will be an appropriately comparable level. If, however, a level 120 character is in an area, massively high level enemies will spawn so that that player has actual enemies to fight and can gain xp/get rewards. The problem with this is that there are enough high level players on basically every server that these enemies spawn in almost every location in the game, at least that's how my experience has proven to be. The early areas nearest to Vault 76 are always fine and I never see any high level enemies there. However, I might be doing a quest that requires me to go to the Whitespring resort and deal with feral ghouls while searching for an item. Now, those ghouls are SUPPOSED to be level 15-30 generally, and many of them are, however, since it is a very popular spot for both trading and farming, often there will be many high level players in the region and that causes massively over-levelled ghouls to spawn against which I basically have no chance to win against with my current build/gear. I might be able to take out 2-3 with power armor and my best gun IF i'm lucky. This is a MAJOR cause for annoyance because I want to do quests and progress in the game. I like playing it, it's just that there are always these absurdly high level enemies in every corner of the map which I have no choice but to run away from lest they kill me and I drop the crafting supplies that I've been continuously grinding to collect. Really, I just want to get to a respectable level like 50 so that I can craft better weapons and farm for good gear so that I can take on these enemies and play the game in a more or less balanced way. It's taking forever though to get to that level though, so it's starting to dampen my enjoyment of the game as its blocking my ability to progress through the story or finish side quests and also makes many interesting areas of the map impossible to explore. :/

Honestly, this wouldn't be an issue if Bethesda designed enemy spawns differently or used the traditional methods in mmos were in levels are determined by areas, not by nearby players. For example, Guild Wars 2 (prob my fav MMO) has a system wherein enemies' levels are determined by region, however, to keep things interesting for higher level players, when they enter one of these regions, their stats are downscaled to an appropriate level so that enemy mobs can still be at least a little challenging and they won't just one shot everything in the area. This makes gameplay exciting imo because it keeps you engaged no matter where you are on the map or what level your character happens to be. I know this wouldn't particularly work for Fo76 because of the way events and pvp work, however, I'm sure they could have crafted some system that would work better than the current one. I don't know, maybe I'm alone in this, but enemy levels are probably the single only MAJOR complaint I have about the game. Everything else is great. But this one aspect is a major impediment imo.
---
yeah I know regretted it immediately, I‚Äôm not against PvP but not in the campü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Destroying something that took so much of hard work and  collecting tons of materials it‚Äôs just bad, of course you can repair it but you still left with bad taste
---
Zealot 3 star is 30% damage to scorched, vats fills 15% faster and bashing damage increased by 40%  damage 186 and I have all shotgun perks on full with bloodied mess on full aswell .
---
The vampire is 2 star , exploding bullets and breif health boost from hitting enemies .
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a magic weapon atall because the zealot does fail sometimes , it‚Äôs not bugged ... is it possible there‚Äôs a difference between stars ? 
---
It‚Äôs so powerful because of my perk cards .. it absolutely wasn‚Äôt as great before I put the cards on
---
Seriously... ?! At least make an effort...
---
You‚Äôll get mixed responses here, I say submit the ticket. It‚Äôs unfortunate you don‚Äôt have the interaction recorded.
---
Each Wallpaper is purchased once in the shop a one time atom purchase. 
---
There is No in game atom cost for usage.
---
Grahm sells them
---
I want to see more unique CAMP items and less power armor skins, I have no interest in replacing my Black Rider power armor skin anytime soon.
---
serverwide? That sounds even worse. 
---
Those people who can play 16 hours a day and have mules filled with legendaries and the caps/trades to get more could cap it and then you log on for your 1 hour of gameplay you can manage now and then and .. no scrip left.
---
No. Submit a ticket
---
They are only on PC.  The problem is that idiots are so quick to jump on the "NW sucks" bandwagon at every opportunity that they don't make it past the title.
---
I just wish we had more of them rather than several power armor skins that look identical.
---
go see the settlers =0 
---
They have a daily you can do. Also random encounters with settlers provide rep. BUT it's gonna take you quite a while if you're starting from scratch.
---
Yea bud bobblehead was so easy i was looking for one for 3 hours, literally visiting about 40 spawn locations, only to find one at the northern cutthroat camp's watchtower (not listed as spawn on any sites i checked).
---
What you‚Äôre after is called Plan: Advanced Power Connectors. I believe they‚Äôre available at Watoga Vendors, as well as Free States Vendors (along with Grahm as the other user pointed out).
---
I went there and a daily didnt pop ip
---
Some folks are worried Bethesda will ban them for abusing this ‚Äúexploit‚Äù
---
In relation to the pieces of code, you don't really need that. The codes for each silo are posted online weekly so you can still do it later without needing the pieces of code. 
---
Some people sell nuclear keycards in their vendors for 400 - 500 caps. Otherwise just shoot down a cargo bot as other people have said. I just shoot them down when I see them instead of tracking one through modus.
---
I am after the door at lv 99 hopping I can make it
---
A while back some jerks invited me to team so they could kill me. When I respawnwed they were AFK and just standing there, but I couldn‚Äôt hurt them (selected revenge but you know, bugged). So I taunted a radscorpion to follow me then ran around their characters until the scorpion decided to attack and kill them instead.
---
TONIGHT... WE¬¥LL DINE IN... Slocums Joe!?! :D
---
Was a bug. Logged in with diff character, got a level( with the perk pack. Logged back to my original and there they were.
---
I agree that the legendary one is worse considering you can make a new char and level up, it just bothers me I have to do the wayward inn quest again and again etc
---
Do settlers daily quests and gain reputation, you can be an ally of both factions
---
Personally I would do nothing and say nothing. Just don't use the dev room stuff yourself. If you get banned then explain it. I mean so many people just run around with clean Mr Fuzzy suits and they arn't banned.
---
Yeah, I figured I will get some mixed responses here. Thats why I try to emphasize the "thoughtful answers" part. Do you know if Bethesda is known to ban players who turn themselves in over situations like this? I'm not comfortable with just not doing anything and hope for the best.
---
I have a pump shotgun that‚Äôs explosive too and it‚Äôs not very powerful ... all the combats that arnt explosive seem to deal more damage than explosive that‚Äôs all , they arnt magic weapons because any baddies over level 50 take a couple shots to kill even withe zealot shotgun . 
---
Explosive weapons seem to deal very little damage ... I have the same issue with my pistols , one is explosive and one isn‚Äôt and the explosive seems to take so much effort to kill anything when the explosive rounds should be doing more damage ?
---
I use 1st and I agree we need higher levels on thise and be able to turn in more tresure notes. not often I go over 20k do to the limit off 30k
---
What do you want here exactly?  You're new so you should take reduced damage?  
---
If you don't want to die then don't get shot at.  Learn the maps, pay attention to your surroundings, sneak around and run when someone spots you.  Otherwise if someone gets the drop on you of course they're going to have the surprise advantage and you're probably going to die.
---
It's a battle royale, not super happy fun everyone wins time.
---
Out of curiosity, why don't you simply wear broken unyielding?
---
Im bad with names but i want to romance whats her name at the wayward and the responder one with the dog lol.
---
I see you found the meth lab.
---
Yea it has bashing damage
---
I've also found the community to be very kind, generous, and fun to play with. I've only met 2 jerks that tried to blow up my camp, and killed my cow, but otherwise it's been nice.
---
What plans and recipe and how did you find out they were dev room?
---
Hard to play when every 2nd game there is a hacker slapping you from other side of map. Bethesda are terrible when it comes to dealing with hackers.
---
Todd Howard can fit more shit in his angry little man mouth than you can fit imaginary items in your storage lol
---
I was very low level, and I still "thought" you had to kill all of the Super Mutants in Grafton Steel Mill to take the workshop, but they kept handing my behind to me, every time I tried.  One day, I was walking by the Grafton Steel Mill, not planning to bother with it on that particular day, when I saw Grahm coming down the road.  I had some experiences with Grahm before, so I ran into the Grafton Steel Mill, took a few pot shots at a couple of Super Mutants, then I ran back out of the gate and ran behind Grahm.  Of course, when those Super Mutants shot Grahm, trying to get to me, he went ballistic and ran into the steel mill entrance yard to smash them.  At that point, other Super Mutants came out and started shooting at Grahm.  He kept smashing Super Mutants in his vicinity, then after he finished them off he ran up the stairs to take care of the ones who were sniping at him from up above.  I stayed back at a safe distance, taking shots at Super Mutants when I could.  I tried to follow Grahm, but I lost him at one point, when he went inside the buildings to smash Super Mutants who were shooting at him through the open doorways.  By the time Grahm was thoroughly satisfied that he had smashed enough Super Mutants, he wandered merrily along his way with Chally.  I was able to handle the handful of remaining Super Mutants.  Thanks to Grahm doing most of the work for me, I was FINALLY able to clear Grafton Steel Mill of all Super Mutants, and I claimed the workshop!  :)
---
I will n ever understand how so many people can so consistently complain about finding fucking bubblegum.  There's dozens of spawns in the forest alone.  For fuck sake there's even a thread from  today where someone provided a guide to completing the entire challenge without having to leave flatwoods.
---
Most likely the build meant tank killer in perception if it is a rifle build.
---
Oh, well there you go.  Enjoy your murder machine until it get patched.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bugged or magic , I have the best mods and perk cards for my shot guns , I‚Äôve scrapped so many combats for mods that I‚Äôve got the best on my guns ... it doesn‚Äôt one shot kill EVERYTHING but most lower than level 50 ... my issue is that all my explosive weapons seem to deal less damage that the regular ones ... my pistols are the same
---
To make cables through walls you have to switch the wall into a door put the cable through the doorway onto a power connector at the other side of the wall. Then just switch the door back into a wall and the cable goes through the wall 
---
:3
---
I've got a level 40 2 star anti armour pump action, I've tried every other shotgun in the game apart from the gauss and it just one shot kills almost everything. My level 50 explosive instagating shotgun is terrible.... I don't get it either
---
Bourbon, it's in the recipe!
---
That works too thx!
---
What did you try to trade them? Just because they don‚Äôt want what you have doesn‚Äôt mean they only want real money for their guns
---
Did they happen to have one line of multiple items like grendades or mines, which also count as weapons?  One entry of 51 mines would have accounted for the remaining weapons.
---
You can ride a specific mr fuzzy ride that was available through the atom shop, that's about it
---
On PC. Same thing
---
Why do you have a problem with him asking ? I get its frustrating but still
---
You ar damn right, it's really a joy.  
---
i'm always happy when i came back to my camo (BTW i am always neat the lightouse with the mothman event) to found ppl using the Camp or simply go trough it to watch it.   
---
i'm putting a very big effort in it (even if maybe this can't be seen in first place) and try every day to find new plan to make it better.  
---
feel invited id out world matches! :)
---
What's google used for?
---
But it‚Äôs not just the shotguns it happens to , it‚Äôs any explosive weapon I have as measly damage on it ... and it shouldn‚Äôt be
---
Just get an anti armour shotty
---
It probably won‚Äôt happen... sadly. 
---
I think it has something to do with loading or something. Anyway they have never acknowledged this one as of what i know. 
---
But yeah it would be nice!
---
Well according to the angry turtle video anyways.  I've known about the magic shotgun stuff for a while but only watched his video yesterday and remembered I moved a junkies combat to my mule because it was "too good to scrip". He claimed junkies was a magic effect.
---
Just transferred it to my main and gave it a try....think it was even doing less damage than what it said in the pip boy LMAO.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong :)
---
Cant even ask questions without getting the google reply
---
Well that makes them less money. 
---
As you get more invested it gets harder. If you are only 7 rewards away from the final score you are going to want to spend more atoms. Imagine it as a hill with an ever increasing incline ,with a copy of Skyrim 2 at the top. If you were close enough but not enough where you could just do some dailies you would spend real money.
---
Goddamnit to hell.. :-( thanks for making me temper expectations though.
---
Yeah but how about a full stash and THEN scrap the displays. People could create virtual bigger stashes. Just like before with the chem weight perk. I could fill my stash to 875lbs that way before patches
---
I don't really want to be a slave to a build, I just play to have fun. Which is also why I just ignore enemies like that and go around if I can't after trying my best.
---
Its used to make the endgame gear and camp objects like the decontmination shower
---
Craft certain ultracite ammo, prime receivers, PA mods.
---
Thank you for An answer to my question !
---
Doing the daily for Ward will earn settler rep. Also random spawn events where settlers are fighting enemies. If you join the fight then talk to the leader, you‚Äôll earn some rep there.
---
And all those weapons dropped in one spot, I end up at about 800lbs
---
More bullions and atoms would be good enough. Because skins might like more or not but doesn't disturb. 
---
Example, I'm not using the just plain black combat rifle because halloween rifle.
---
Me personally I have no issues being with low levels no matter the kind of team. At times I enjoy being with low levels because they still have quest to complete and when there going around completing there quest im getting caps though not much lol. That being said I do use teams as a cheap fast travel option so i sometimes jump teams while im shopping so i can travel to player camps for free.
---
I hate the NW rank up score challenges but up till now I‚Äôve only missed one challenge to revive teammates, I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm missing any more, especially now I‚Äôm about 7 spaces ahead of Zorbo
---
I think we have the answer there. If i remind it correctly, bashing dmg is one of the magic(broken) legendary perks that lets the dmg calculation glitch.
---
Same my man haha
---
Don't worry, I'm here to represent the dads.....
---
Super mooooootant cows.
---
For this first season, there are 100 levels for the Legendary Run.  When you log into the game, from your main game "Menu", you can select "Legendary Run" and it will show you the roadmap for prizes.  Once you get to level 78, you are awarded the chicken coop.  You still have a few weeks to grind for the chicken coop, or to buy a few levels with atoms.
---
Yes Sir. I really want that too.
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I mean , explosive weapons seem to have rubbish damage even though they should be immense, all my explosive weapons have terrible damage it‚Äôs not just the shotguns üòÇ that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs magic or bugged I think there‚Äôs an issue with the explosive weapons not the regular ones , I‚Äôve worked hard on mods for my shotguns so they should be powerful close range ... it‚Äôs the explosive ones that feel like I‚Äôm shooting things with a level 1 gun ... it‚Äôs awful !
---
The dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be, unnatural
---
if the stash is full just dont allow it to be scrapped. Just give a little message stating you dont have space in your stash. But considering this most recent banwave it doesnt matter what it is people will find a way to abuse it.
---
Whoah wait that never crossed my mind, starting a new character for NW gives you quick and easy NW levelling??
---
Oh dang. I need to get going on my legendary run more. Didnt realize it was from this.
---
This is fallout 4.
---
Please!!!
---
I also pretty much only shoot the shotgun in vats, the rubber banding damage makes it useless otherwise. If I run out of AP (rare with the right perks) I switch to a furious flamer.  Explosive guns are just for tagging in my game.
---
If that‚Äôs the case , let this broken glitch continue :) I rather enjoy it ! I will say all my explosive pistols etc also deal crap damage when they should be far more powerful , I think the bug is with the explosive weapons being far too weak ! It‚Äôs like shooting with a level 1 gun .. it‚Äôs awful !
---
I agree; while I do love pvp, camp griefing is just sad.
---
They say they don‚Äôt. There was a post awhile ago claiming someone got in trouble for reporting a bug.... but then it turns out that player exploited the game like crazy. 
---
I say your best action is report it and keep a mature dialogue going with support.
---
Claim workshops to get plans for your camp. Everything from water purifiers to couches will only be craftable once you learn the plan.
---
Don't worry about getting attacked by another player as it's extremely rare. If you are the paranoid type, just claim a workshop and do the 1st 'defend' mission, then log out to a new world. 
---
Don't spend your legendary scrip before level 45!!! 
---
You'll be prompted to rather early but just bank it for later.
---
Grab everything you see! Whether you think you need it or not. Most of the 'junk' in Fo4 was just that, junk, but *everything* in FO76 has a use. Grab it all until you hit level 20 and have a good stockpile of misc. stuff like plastic and concrete. 
---
Screws and adhesive will be the #1 priority for scavenging the entire time you play. You'll eventually develop a farming run for yourself to make sure you have enough to repair equipment. Adhesive gets hard to come by late game unless you know some 'tricks'. 
---
Plant; Corn, Tato and Mutfruit so you can craft Vegetable Starch which acts as adhesive. 
---
To earn caps, just clear out a place and collect all the weapons. Then hop over to a train station and sell them to the vendor. Make sure to chew some grape mentats first if you have them!
---
Beyond being an arms dealer, you can earn caps by selling drugs. I personally never use chems so I just horde all of them I come across until my stashbox starts getting full, then I sell them all at a vendor.
---
Mama Dolce's is in Morgantown and an event there will give you Canned Stew that increases XP earned. Be on the lookout for this event. 
---
If you are spending a lot of time in a certain area, consider building your camp nearby for free travel. You can have a water purifier that does not require a water source present, so don't think you have to find a spot with water. 
---
Whatever you do... when you make it to Whitesprings, don't attack the staff!! ;p
---
Yeah, probably last week they'll turn on an unannounced Double SCORE weekend for marketing reasons xDD
---
I feel ur pain in vats being drained so fast , I have to have a breather all the time .... so guided meditation is way too much for me ... I have to have a nap before I can continue killing üòÇ
---
What‚Äôs wrong with the Screaming Eagle skin? This is the one for the Handmade, correct?
---
Ah see, since the first time the challenge came up for gum, ive been hoarding the stuff, every level up, plus i think the fasnacht protectron gets you gum.
---
I only craft perfect unyielding sets. I'm Vanguard T\_T
---
I started a new character to basically gain an extra 800 carry weight in adventure but added bonus of being level 0 in NW... No perks but as long as I've stuck to my team I've levelled up every game so far üëç
---
Need more displays. Maybe some fancy weapon shelves.
---
They might, since Anti-Armor effect and perks stack, but its diminished.
---
It's a season that awards skins and consumables rather than pay-to-win items. If you're looking for more than that, you're asking for something that's a whole lot more controversial than what we got.
---
Was unaware they didn't count towards the machine limit, so obvious now that you've mentioned it!
---
Yaaassssss :)
---
Wish I knew this last night 6 games it took me to hit level 48 and that‚Äôs with me coming 2nd most rounds
---
They should have made each advancement rank a 10 point increase instead of a 25 point increase per rank up.
---
You get the the green zone, its a tough grind.

Yea it‚Äôs been well over a year. They also used to weigh a lot more
---
It's the short names of legendary effects.
---
AA = Anti Armor
---
B = Bloodied
---
F = Furious
---
I = Instigating
---
E (as secondary) = explosive
---
FFR (secondary) = Faster firerate
---
Definitely been asking for a display case with more storage holes for ages.
---
Idk, overall, I like the great majority of the rewards.
---
That said, what really irked me is that we kept earning the same skins, just for different items. That just seemed like stupid filler to me. I agree though that scrap kits and fireworks could be dropped too.
---
Fair question - I do a lot of queens and the number of times I have spawned in the rad zone and had to equip my hazmat /stealth suit from my favourites..üòÇ As I would then be unable to requip the broken armour I figured I would try a Level 1 set I have been building on my mule  and was just wondering what the maths was for low DR vs 0 DR.
---
Get rid of vats grenades and for everyone to be in 1st person view only. That gets rid of the try hards.
---
Thanks helps a lot
---
K thanks
---
A community manager said as much in [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hwc99o/why_in_the_world_arent_combat_rifle_skins/fyzdthi/?context=1000) and [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hw0l6m/the_dark_matter_combat_rifle_skin_needs_to_be/fyzc3o2/?context=1000). *Maybe* they're just talking about the Dark Matter skin, but the first thread asks about all combat rifle skins, not just that one.
---
Depends on the plan - I can get full price and more for Fasnacht and Mounted plans, and Small Letters has been good. But the vast majority I sell for at most half the price suggested. You just know which ones you have a chance with and which ones you don't.
---
Thanks for the necro post, but I left the cluster fuck of a game not long after.
---
Man if only that was me lol. Ive still yet to get the fixer plan and I once found a player selling it and got excited till I saw he had it listed for 12k caps and I had 800 lol.
---
I dare say November..... Just a hunch
---
Hey wanna lend me some steel :'(
---
Don‚Äôt run out in the open... try sneaking around a bit
---
I'm guessing you have sneak perk.. That is useless if you are full unyielding. With high agility you get you will be very good at sneaking without the perk. Also, you most likely have something not worth it on Luck. Hard to give you a proper answer when you only provide us with base stats and not the actual build.
---
Keep it up!! Great job!!
---
Hmm if you're on PC, and it was the blue suitcase inside Watoga, I might have an idea who left those there lol
---
Yikes
---
You likely purchased a wallpaper you didn't own yet. You can do that through the build menu. They usually go for 500 when not on sale
---
Reload animation is bad, missing sights, and...that's about it.
---
Bad reload animation and missing sights.
---
its because SS armor is so girthy
---
yup
---
I just jumped back in a week ago after taking a month off, and I was progressing well with my score. Already level 21... then I realized it's been double score xp since I've returned. Dailies should always be worth 1000 or 500... half that is ridiculously slow.
---
I think the camera skins kind died out quickly, have they even released anything new for it in a while?  I don't think the majority care, I only carry the camera because I have to carry the camera for one quest.  They've gotten rid of the camera challenges, now just things you can do with photomode.  
---
The camera, much like other activities in the game, has simply died out as unimportant
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

Nice. Also. I don't wish to alarm you but if you go back to the Sickleman location. It now says Sickleman IS here.
---
I heared about the season with rewards; I came back toi FO76 and played; realized rewards are useless; uninstalled again;nothing worth grinding if this isnt ur main game
---
Use shotguns with enforcer to cripple their legs. As a bonus, you will get one of the most broken visual displays of a crippled enemy in all of the Fallout franchise. I cried laughing the first time I did it. You won't be disappointed!
---
Seriously--just clean your stash and sit tight. Possession is 9/10ths of the law! ;) 
---
One of two things will occur;
---
A) Nothing. (Likely outcome) 
---
B) They'll ban you for like a week tops, you keep the stuff, and move on with your life after having a week break to eat a few Cornetto's and catch up with some friends.
---
You can only sell them raw flux, not inert.
---
Yeah but the plushie
---
Scrip is the worst. Todd help you if you intend to craft AND play on the same day.
---
I dont mind the changes in how many of whatever it takes. It mixes it up. As long as it doesnt keep gradually going up.
---
The only one that annoys me is the legendary one. That can be a bit more tedious. But everything else is fine. Its not difficult finding 3 bubblegum, or completing 3 events etc.
---
Besides now I know bubble-gum and pre war food come up, i stock up on em.
---

---
Adrenaline doesn't work so i replaced it atm
---
Have you actively looked for Ward and talked to him?
---
I have an alt who has done like barely any story quests in the game and i am able to get the daily from ward
---
Yeah i couldnt find him
---
Yeah I got the giant Sheepsquatch Plushie today and I feel like I don‚Äôt need to care about it anymore lol. Just not a whole lot that interests me for my build. There‚Äôs so cool camp items I guess but overall I don‚Äôt feel the need to get them when more than likely they‚Äôre gonna sell a version of most of this shit in the shop anyway lol
---
I like to look on fallout wiki before I enter places.
---
I used to be happy to see "Ghouls" but since I've gone lvl40 any place with Ghouls usually has a Wendingo or Glowing one as the king.
---
I try and run and jump on something.
---
When you go in foundation turn hard right and he should either be in the white unit on the left behind a desk or the white unit at the end in bed
---
The Railway is a very powerful gun, if you can lead your shots a little.
---
I love it, especially an explosive one is incredibly powerful.
---
That's awesome, I hated it as I played the defend the workshop flashed up on the screen and I totally ignored it.  I just put a bunch or turrets around it and it actually finished the challenge for me once.
---
It makes up for the slowness with extra damage. Which you might not need tho if you‚Äôre already 1shotting stuff anyways.
---
Or atleast tell us if they're selling legendary weapons and average star rating and prices? It does annoy me going to s camp in the savage divide thinking I'm going to find some sick items and then it's all pipe weapons or low level legendary items for ridiculous prices.
---
PSA: don‚Äôt kill the boss and farm the respawns over and over, including extra legendaries.
---
Id get rid of gun fu tbh. It's quicker to just hit the vats button for each enemy. And being a bloodied build myself, I feel the extra damage from gf would only really be useful against a bunch of scorchbeasts. Unless preserving ammo is your aim?
---
Get the herbivore serum, and egghead serum from a player vendor. Equip green thumb (perception) super duper and good with salt (luck). 
---
Then go to uncanny caverns and harvest brain fungus. Make brain fungus soup - it boosts intelligence. 
---
Next, make cranberry relish. Fast travel to mothman Museum, and run the coast south, picking snaptail reeds. Process the reeds into sugar. Go to Mac‚Äôs farm (bog), harvest the cranberries. There are a lot of already picked cranberries in the boat in the middle as well. Now, go to horneright summer estate (just under new gad). Go to the greenhouse in the back and pick the goard. Plant this at your camp and use green thumb to keep harvesting it and planting more. Once you got a good crop, pick them all and go make as much cranberry relish as you can. 
---
Herbivore doubles the boosts of vegetarian food. Egghead gives you more intelligence. The soup makes you have +4 intelligence, the relish gives you +20% xp. It also helps a lot if you are bloodied and have a full set of unyielding, since your intelligence will be super high as well. 
---
Now join a building public team to get another intelligence boost and get to clearing out everything you can. I entered the run almost 2 weeks in, and I almost have caught up to zorbo pretty much just from the repeatable.
---
Then what would they complain about?
---
I thought junkies was only magical for heavy weapons so that might be why?
---
Hope so. Ultralight limbs for my vats character too I hope
---
Yeah, i always assumed it was bad because yaknow, it shoots spikes. I was mistaken
---
Nop, but when adrenaline will be fixed I will put ot instead of gun fu and I kinda wanted to keep evasive, being bloodied
---
so long as the settlers are non-hostile you can do their one daily quest to earn reputation with them. it will take a while. you could have gotten the stealth suit for free if you did their quests before doing the Raider's 79 raid. but if you did not you will have to buy it with gold

Well if I recall correctly, one of my friend's reported that some heavy dupers never got suspended or banned. My female friend who got suspended was unbanned on the 23rd. I asked her if she submitted evidence with her ticket like I did but all she said was that she just kept checking to see if she could sign in and when she was able to, she noticed that her character wasn't altered and still had everything. Finally, I noticed that 3 days after I submitted my trade logs as evidence after getting help from twitter customer support, my ticket got closed as a duplicate and when I went to twitter for answers, a handful of others had the same thing happen. The only response that was given was that support made a final determination and to await further update.
---
Honestly, I just don't know what to expect anymore.
---
I was 6 spaces away from Zorbo before starting on Friday now I am just one space away.  I think I will be fine if they have another double weekend.
---
It can be good, it‚Äôs also just a fun weapon to use. I would encourage you not to put an auto receiver on it though, it gets a little to hard to control.
---
You could get rid of Fireproof or lower it to 1 if you put the Dense mod on your chest piece. In S, bandolier (ammo weight reduction) might be worth trying and dropping the armor weight reduction. That one could be a coin toss
---
I was walking right beside the road to get to Flatwoods. Then I heard a low hum. I drop low. Scan my surroundings. I did not know much about what was in game except the dogs roaming the Forrest. Off in the distance I see it this was day 3 of playing. A purple glow was walking ergh floating through the brush. It was so small I could barely make out what it was. I walked back a mile and tried to get by on the other side of the road. I found out 2 months later. It was a Flatwoods monster. My first encounter with an alien.
---
Huh I didn't experience any of that stuff ü§î
---
It depends on your rep with each faction.  I went with the raiders because I had more rep and wanted the ammo maker. It took me a couple of more weeks to max out rep with the settlers. Now I can buy anything available for bullion.
---
Considering the current max score from dailies/weeklies is over 30k past the amount needed for Rank 100, and that NW every day will net you 17.5k (250x7x10) you don't need to play it at all! But there are some nice ones like placing a CAMP which is an easy 250 anyway!
---
You can drink inert flux.
---
This game is pretty shit
---
Cavalier and Sentinel doesn't show with those names. They are armour legendary effects. Cavalier is damage reduction while sprinting and Sentinel is damage reduction while not moving.
---
Thanks so just to be clear it‚Äôs more of who you can max out rep first than anything else
---
damn mr handy, wheres the cheese?
---
Actually I have a quad with the auto receiver and recoil stock. 25% less VATS cost as well. Can go through all 40 shots in a clip in VATS at great accuracy. One of my characters is solely built for auto railway rifles: ).
---
You need to hold Caps Lock while you're talking to activate voice chat.
---
Forgot to add, Gun Fu is a must with this build :)
---
Thank you very much :)
---
No you can still choose either.  The higher your rep with a fraction, the more things that are available to be purchased with the bullion that you get in the end. PS... Keep all of the bullion for yourself, it wont really effect anything longterm.
---
For a high level player, yes I agree. For a new player, season was timed to coincide with Xbox game pass release, it maybe a nice incentive to logon daily.
---
For me aesthetics are not a substitute for content, but maybe for others, a firework can make your day. It‚Äôs a bit annoying that a lot of this ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù has inventory weight. 
---
Also had a couple of instances where my lunchboxes expired so automatically applied. The effect of party streamers made the bodies disappear so no loot dropped.
---
Has it actually been on the AS after its initial release?
---
I wish they kept it like in Fallout 4 where you can nail body parts to walls xD
---
if his definition of server wide is all players, its definitely bad  
---
if its for each world server, definitely bad for normal people and awesome for the fucking 1st
---
Okay cool so as both of my reps are pretty similar it doesn‚Äôt really matter then . Is there anything specific for each faction I should rush for or not really
---
It should be account level then for mules
---
I still use my camera every day, and not just for Davenport's daily, so I don't think it died out at all. But yeah, skins aren't going to be super popular for it since it's too small to show off and only screenshot lovers will be using it heavily. I got the woodgrain skin because I'm a sucker for woodgrain electronics, but I regret not waiting till it was on sale.
---
Still, since people aren't really going to pay for a camera skin, that might make it decent filler on a season reward table. Like the photomode frames and poses they put on this one.
---
Two shot railway...ouch. That's a strong weapon, but I flinch at the thought of the recoil that would have if you turned it automatic. How accurate is it at long range? If it's accurate enough, it can definitely benefit from the TSE synchronization
---
I didn't know that. What a fun detail!
---
it's Todd, trying to get you to buy FO1st.
---
That is up to you.  I myself thought the ammo maker was the coolest thing. Other than that to me it was all kind of meh.  There are new weapons but I didn't need any of them.
---
Okay Thanks for the help
---
I came here to say pretty much this, they tried super hard with a bunch of camera skins and countless daily/weekly challenges of taking stupid pictures, but it was too clear that people don't care that much about it. Doesn't help that they made it so obnoxious to find it and don't allow you to sell/trade spares to anybody
---
If you're talking about if you can hit things at long range: i definitely can. If you're talking about damage at long range, im not sure i havent fully tested it yet
---
Ah yes, the soft underbelly of the fo76 community shows itself again. üòÖ
---
It does not matter. If you‚Äôre at the point of raiding 79 you‚Äôve taken things as far as possible. If you got the Chinese armor you‚Äôve saved yourself 4000 gold down the road. The factions aren‚Äôt going to talk to you any differently.
---
Right here  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
Yeah I made sure to get the Chinese stealth armor plans I was just wondering if it actually matters who I choose to take on the raid or not
---
I think the idea was one challenge is trivial and can be done as soon as you log in,  one takes a bit of work or game knowledge but still kind of trivial, one is kind of trivial but takes a bit of luck, one takes a bit of work, and one is non trivial, takes some game knowledge and maybee a bit of luck, and a lot of work, (Assaulttron kill in the kill robots, which for some people is the only real challenge in that ckallenge, especially if you don‚Äôt have a decent build or a anti bot weapon.
---
He's usually in bed. Literally.
---
Enjoy and don't bother dying often
---
Is it even worth the grind. Like what are the stats of it
---
This is how you transform into one, sleep with one and that's it, you are a ghoul.
---
Stop picking up exterminator's sledgehammers and zealot's broadsiders then. No matter how high the limit is, some people will complain that their x hours of daily grinding leave them with too much. It's not like scrip is that useful anymore, unless you're rolling for the perfect set of thorn or solar armor you will finish using it up pretty quickly. Strangler armor has a heavy cost but it's one-time. Legendary module weapons don't take too long to get a good roll. The purveyor rolls have been obsolete for a long time now. 
---
I'd say that bethesda doesn't need to throw the cheaters any more bones, but it doesn't even really matter anymore. If they can get away with duping all the god rolls they want without any punishment, having unlimited scrip would hardly matter to them
---
With cheaters of all kind
---
What if its a bunch of .38 or syringer ammo then
---
No., doesn‚Äôt matter. Have heard settlers raid is easier to do. Raid will finish and you‚Äôll be left with dailies and the grind when it‚Äôs done. 250 rep exp per day from each faction. Working towards 6000 then 12000 total rep to max with each faction. You‚Äôll be able to start trading treasury notes for gold, 20 for 200 gold per day, 5000 max gold cap. Can start buying items for gold from both factions and from the secret service in vault 79. You can‚Äôt get the ammo maker, Gauss shotgun or gauss minigun until max rep. That takes awhile. The reps of each faction will be running close to side by side since you took both as far as you did.
---
Thanks, Can you send the link please ? X
---
Probably want to try a trade sub.
---
When my friend played the game we had so much fun with each other but he grew to hate the game and now he never wants to play it again I‚Äôve tried to convince him to come back but he feels betrayed by Bethesda which is fair
---
So in theory it‚Äôs better off to not do the raid until I have reached a high rep level with the faction then
---
Don't be in too much of a rush to get it. Outside of nuke zones, the stealth suit can't compete with an appropriately set up 5 piece armor set. 
---
However as a mid game to early end game yeah it's pretty solid. But I found I lost versatility on my stealth build using it, not to mention the AP refreshes etc. When not farming mats in a nuke it sits in my stash gathering dust.
---
I'd argue I'd spend my bullion on the raider ammo machine first. Just my own take on it.
---
Only decent thing was the white tree with the cage. Wish there was variants of it though, with and without the cage. Guess I'll wait 10 years for some different tree variants.
---
Legendary one can be random, I had a horde event pop and got all three, and then spent a couple of hoursthe next time three legendary poped because everyone was dog piling on any multi legendary event.
---
Explosive turns it into a hitscan weapon, which makes it the most powerful single shot rifle (second only to the gauss rifle). The only downside is there is no suppressor for it. But in terms of fire rate and reload speed it‚Äôs kickass.
---
I bought a quad explosive one from a vendor once and turned it automatic. On a dedicated VATS Commando that could very well be one of the best guns in the game. Outside of VATS it literally breaks your back tho. The recoil is so strong it pushes your crosshair straight up after like 5 shots lol
---
I hate this. Running around trying to see if there is a windego colossus and I turn to see a 1-3 scorchbeast(s) flopping on the ground behind me is kinda freaky. Spawning onto my camp and having them land on and around it making it impossible to interact with the various pieces of said camp is infuriating. 
---
I had a game where for well over two hours I had a legendary scorchbeast corpse come with me throughout the map. I should have done pictures and done some sort of ‚ÄúMe and Scorchy just visited the wayward, boy was Duchess happy to see us! Scorchy really liked playing with Bessie.‚Äù Joke posts
---
Get the Class Freak perk if you have the SPECIAL to spare. Lowers the negatives on mutations by 75% at max rank.
---
I think it would be cool if you could like hire a caravan where you can buy something from far away and have it delivered to your camp and put in your stash, like lets say Billy just did site alpha and you want something but you wanna hurry and get to the scorch bitch queen, you can pay an extra like 500 caps to have it delivered or something like that
---
Or better yet keybind it to whatever key you prefer.
---
Lol the private worlds would be op
---
No, once both are at choose sides you want to get that done. You can only turn in 20 treasury notes per day which is 200 gold. Waiting longer costs you 200 per day that you could have been banking. To my knowledge, you can‚Äôt turn in notes for gold or buy 300 per week from smiley for 6000 caps until you finish the raid and main storyline.
---
Battle royales suck. NW is a battle royale. Therefore NW sucks. I'm lvl 98 and I still think it sucks. TDM/ CTF would be more fun for most players.
---
TV dinner trays at the watoga and morgantown high schools and at the penitentiary are helpful.
---
I will log on around 2pm EST, since I scrap about everything I might have something, i'll take a look for mods.  My gamertag is "Send Me 4 I Am"
---
Ahhh okay got you thank you very much
---
Then you just run down to the overseer camp, craft a weapon and armor, go talk to the wayward people and boom level 3.
---
Hide and seek championship it should be called üòÇ
---
There is a voice chat build in game. You can set it up on your game settings. First thing you do.. Turn on your push to talk. Or you will broadcast all that happens in your house/home/apartment/whatever. But.. You will find out very fast that there are very few players out there that actually talk or use voice chat.
---
It may be different next time, but by and large the same
---
Two friends and I went to the New River Gorge Bridge, played the banjo, then jumped off without Power Armor. Fun times. They quit after that day though, and that was either the final day of beta or launch day itself :(
---
Claim a workshop here and there; easy, fast and good XP and various plans as a bonus (especially at your level). Just claim it and walk away, don‚Äôt defend and risk pvp. If enemies take it over just return later and reclaim.
---
honestly not a lot of people have mics in this game. it's just not a big thing in 76. possibly owing to the fact that many fallout players are single player types because thats what fallout has always been. we're anti social lol.
---
It is one of three guns that I have that will never ever be traded.
---
A lot of xp grinding. Bloodied build gives you lots of extra special points inc. Intelligence and charisma which gives you an xp boost too which a lot of people don't know. Also being in a building group not an event group boosts your intelligence which gives you more xp. Then on top having well rested, cranberry relish, canned meat stew, mentats, berry mentats, leader bobblehead and live&amp;love 8 magazines all boost xp.
---
But I have to admit, when I got close enough to the end, I used atoms to rank up on the board as I didn't want to waste my life away grinding.
---
Let‚Äôs be honest, the game is bad, but I still got it because I love Fallout stories and I‚Äôm part of a community that makes the game fun for the long run.
---
It's the power armor - garbage drop from the SBQ, and yes, it's the same stuff you get for free, which is why I was surprised someone bought it, let alone at full price. Maybe they wanted to make their own, or (since they were level 47) they hadn't done the Brotherhood missions yet and had no clue they'd get a full set on completion. 
---
Some of the stuff I sell I do for my own amusement - sell part one of "Who Goes There" for 10 caps, part 2 for 990 (sold part two a week ago). I sell excess Technical Data (if you got an extra before depositing the first, it just sits in your MISC inventory forever) for 100 caps despite it being worthless - somehow it's flagged and can't kick off the mission for anyone.
---
The biggest problem I have is always legendaries, between the limit for them and the different amounts they are worth its a game just trying to both max how much you get and getting rid of the most weight.
---
Ok :D
---
I just got this weird feeling of Deja Vu.  Strange.
---
Looks like you had alot of fun with this game! Love how your character descended into madness and debauchery as time progressed.
---
Also, love the fez
---
Destroy it right in front of Ward..  Office Space style
---
This is true ^
---
You can‚Äôt
---
I believe this is a violation of subreddit rules.
---
I met a new friend! Low level player came to my camp and bought 15 shotgun shells. I said that just won't do, here's 500! Well he kept coming back for a few days and we did our best to communicate with emotes. I helped him with quests and eventually we both started using voice chat. Now we play almost daily and it warms my cold dead heart. Having him talking with me gives me confidence to use voice chat.
---
Mr. Smiths ID card is one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
What do you mean?
---
You do if you want the paltry amount of atoms that are part of it, since this replace the atom challenges.
---
Maybe there are?
---
Grahm travels with Chally, and most Super Mutants travel with Mutant Hounds (and Floaters recently).
---
Maybe Chally is a Super Mutant Cow?
---
Her milk's twice as beneficial as normal Brahmin Milk and she's invulnerable.
---
I do it if I join a team and see the team leader mooching off the other members for caps. Folks are going afk and just taking the caps you get from other people finishing quests.
---
I like that each setting with the bodies tells a story if you look at them long enough. Not all are Easter eggs, but still they put thought into each scene.
---
Yes there has been a few warning posts about this. Bethesda needs to fix. Good to throw out another warning.
---
I never added it cause I was scared I‚Äôd have to rebuild.
---
Level 378. Share sneak card.  Most times I join a team I get booted. Even if there is only two of us in it. Don‚Äôt have mike on. Not toxic. So now I just form my own team automatically when I join server to use herd mentality mutation.   If a bunch of low levels join my team it‚Äôs fine but I will leave team to launch nukes so it don‚Äôt complete [i am death ] on them
---
As i write in every post about this,there must be some criteria we don't know yet,because it works perfectly on my two mule characters. But it doesn't work on the new toon i daily make for the lvl up challenge.
---
I'd rather have the FREE atoms i used to get instead.
---
No. What you need is chickens. Chickens behind the barb wire fences in the PTS Atomic Shop.....
---
With a Deathclaw guarding them inside.
---
Yes I am having a lot of fun. My character was once a simple vault dweller, now he is an eccentric axe welding, nukashine brewing, hoarder.
---
All good ticket raised thanks
---
Oh really? That's awesome! I will definitely do that, thanks for the advice!
---
Everything you're saying with this game I said about ESO. I did quite a few years before realising it'd run its course in my gaming life. 
---
At the end of the day, every game will go through its 'death' phase as you move onto other shit. I get it. Even after only 6 months of F76 there's only so much content you can do and I literally only said to my wife a few mins ago I'll be done with F76 probably before Christmas. I don't know how yall have lasted since 2018 launch as there's barely anything to do after the Fissure Site dust settles.... Wastelanders took no time to finish even casually. 
---
We'll see. But the community 'gripe' about no end game is fully justified. It's an intended MMO written as a linear 'play and drop' title, whereas most MMO are supported by team trials, PvP, respec'ing and delve/4man missions... Leader board stuff etc. There's always *something* to work at. 
---
If I had a wish, even for something as a basic introduction, it'd be a respec option. I'd happily eke out another few months being able to convert my stealth rifleman to a BoS PA juggernaut with a 50 cal. I don't know if I'll ever see this. 
---
OP good luck with your next game!
---
Haha! My wife calls them Bathetic! Lol
---
Do the rewards go to your other account?
---
2cm Ultracite ammo
---
buy the assaultron item from vendor for around 2K caps 
---
then craft the assaultrom keycard thing 
---
and go to the pylon site
---
I would like if we could spend , let's say cap/gold bullion/scrips to upgrade Stash size limit and camp budget/size.
---
It would add nice way to spend extra caps/gold/scrips.
---
They've done it in other games,too. I was playing "Wolfenstein",which Bethesda is also a part of. In one of the Nazi bases I found a drinks machine that i looked closer at and found one of the buttons was marked for Nuka Cola.
---
Which one is the t65 skin?
---
Ah that seems wonderful
---
Before doing any of what you said, Beth needs to fix / remove magic (bugged) and hacked weapons.
---
The problem is that with the server type they chose, you can‚Äôt have each user with an individual mod to then be registered in that one server. Either let private worlds act as private servers with individual settings and modifications and increase player count. Or get top rated modders to help bethesda since bethesda doesn‚Äôt really know what we want. Granted some of this new content is fantastic and I‚Äôm still experiencing changes at locations in just now revisiting, but if they were to get top modders to help them, I think this game could improve exponentially. IMO
---
Me too! I love seeing that also. Thats really cool, makes me very happy to hear :)
---
And I totally agree :)
---
I have the feeling he is gonna maintain the same speed and we are gonna get slow down by the increased requirement per rank
---
For me, no. It's like a set of light combat armor with some fall damage reduction and that Predator shimmer thing going on.
---
Max ability and some perks more than cover the stealth side. And my armor does tons of weight reduction, AP regen, breath under water etc etc etc. 
---
Some people love it, but it's not the most optimal set for stealth. It is amazing for nuke zones though as it basically is a Rad suit. However I haven't fought too many SBQ in the zones lately and I don't need flux anymore.
---
Thats what I use, but it's not ideal. The buggy interface would sometimes select YES for the "Sell Favorites Item" during my furious spending sprees at a vendor. Still better than nothing tho.
---
I'll help
---
Kill the queen and just use the repair kits that you get as a reward
---
Deathclaws have no place on my farms... Give me a Border Collie instead....
---
Same here.  Started during double XP.   Depending on how long people have been playing the game it's worth checking out if you have never played it before just in case you were hit with the bug that handed out 180 perk packs.  My first time playing I opened all of them and ended up at level 10 from double cards without even playing a match.  That's enough to unlock a big chunk of the bugged rewards even if you don't want to grind all the way to the end.  Don't remember exactly when that bug hit but it was a while back.
---
Currently trying to hit level 40 for the only other reward I actually want, the large supply crate stash box.  I want that orange box for my camp.  After that not really interested in the other stuff.
---
you just drink it. it adds the rads but other effects dont stack.
---
then you get teleported. once.
---
every time I hit a player punchbowl and it hs random booze I leave as it is. drink that one and go minding my business.
---
everytime I drink and it‚Äôs nukashine hit the bowl until there‚Äôs no drinks left.
---
If there is 40 players which means 40 inventories + 40 stashes running in same time it's quite taxing on the server.
---
1st scrap box for sure runs in separate server. Its quite lagless.
---
Even f4 had limit in stashes, more stuff inside longer it takes to load.
---
I use a low level mule to peddle my high level shit, so filtering on level alone dont mean anything as you said. some other filtering is needed.
---
Ah, ok.
---
Oh don't get me wrong I'm not blaming them for the decision to not allow modding like they do in most of their games, obviously with the server structure I don't think that's an option. I blame them for having become reliant on modders and never really doing an adequate job of QAing many of their products previously
---
What's your psn, I'm in flatwoods on my other account. I can do water or land revives if you need both
---
Nah mate buy it they're in people's vendors.
---
Alternatively use the Discord trade groups. Ive seen a few in vendors lately though. Usually &lt;10k or so.
---
Yup, just today I noticed I had 20 legendary modules and max scrip, went and got more, crafted (and got only bad rolls) and after storing one had no more room in my stashbox... welp guess I'm done until tomorrow
---
Thanks for Redditsplaining
---
Well said.  I know seasons was an attempt force us to buy Atoms, but all it's done for me is made me play less.  It would be a different story if the rewards were good but you are totally correct they suck!
---
I‚Äôm not sure the difference? My psn is briskcaviar. I don‚Äôt have a mic though
---
Different strokes for different folks.  I don't play with anyone who feels the same as you but you are not the first to post something like this.
---
At least you understand that it is your choice whether or not you wish to participate.  This game has a little something for everyone (excpet end-game progression content for groups.)
---
I don‚Äôt really care,but because I‚Äôve done literally every non repeatable quest in the game I have nothing better to do.I heavily dislike the daily quests so I only do the faction ones to gain that +rep.Otherwise the game is quite boring so why not do some easy challenges and get some decent rewards.I‚Äôve gotten everything I wanted out of it (star wallpaper) so now I‚Äôm just doing it because there isn‚Äôt anything else to do.
---
No lie my whole plan is to get to 80 by the time my Sept FO1st atoms get deposited and then just spend 3k atoms to finish it.
---
Also mutation serums
---
That would have the Walmart effect on lower level players. People may just assume a lvl 20 has nothing but maybe they have a bunch of legendaries that they arent even leveled up to use yet. Maybe they need that money to get going. It can be a tough grind for filthy casuals.
---
On ps4 atleast i had to go change my mic to area cuz the auto is such bull wank  and works like never
---
Np
---
Same
---
Never actually got any recipes for then
---
If I need to avoid hitting the 30k cap limit, I go buy a serum recipe
---
I sometimes take people's workshops since I am bored and done all my dailies, just to see if they are going to pvp. I don't take it if they put work into it and built it up but if it's just a bare workshop I just take it for the lolz. Some people I think find it fun to try to kill me. Once had a guy die to me twice then come back in PA to try again. He died another time and then the next time he came back in his PA and a bloody fatman and nuked me right in the face! But my serendipity kicked in and I took no damage lol.
---
I‚Äôve run the event hundreds of times....it‚Äôs less hassle than the Queen.
---
I think as long as you're near or have gone further than zorbo you're good
---
I'm not fussed if I don't complete the legendary run. It's just cosmetics and I don't give a shit.

Nice one! I love it

&gt;shielded raider
---
Just a quick question. You do have the previous 3 plans right?
---
blocking them only keeps them from being able to add you to teams, friends lists, and voice chat communication. it does not prevent them from joining your public server, or your NW lobby
---
I do it mostly because of player vending
---
I‚Äôm not too sure, not too many. I have 2 bulk and 6 scrap for you
---
Sadly the game isn't made yet
---
That's her wrestling name
---
All i sell is 1 cap bubble gum and quantum
---
I agree with all of it especially the mental illness part i had to force myself many times to not buy the things that i wanted because i also had to force myself to not grind all the time
---
If you're on PC, sure, I've got some you can have.
---
Don't search the Internet. It's actually her porn name.
---
Go to megs camp flatwoods bridge.
---
The minute she dries out though she's toast.
---
I'm with you.. currently about level 35, and that's mainly just organically achieving score without trying. I have no negative feelings toward the Run, and I admit I do like the little awards here and there...it just hasn't grabbed me.
---
Yes and they not even great cosmetics, if the cosmetics were worth the grind, I would say yes, but they basically lame.
---
I play as I normally do, I don't play extra, I won't make 100. I basically login and do my dailies and then log out. I hate the grind and I hate the fact Bethesda have created an unhealthy environment where people feel they have to spend more time in game to get some lame cosmetics.
---
Some of the things are ok, but most are not worth the grind or time.
---
What happens when Season 2 comes? rinse and repeat, this is not healthy
---
Use a level 0 alt. If your half way good at it you can get it with one session.
---
havent played fo76 in a few days now and im afraid it will be months before im back again cuz life 
---
but i wish all of u legendary runners the best of luck
---
There are more than just wendigos that have been introduced in this game. I hope you enjoy more random encounters like this.
---
I had the same problem, but fixed it with copy "Fallout76.ini" from the Main folder -&gt; MyGames-&gt;insert it into Fallout 76
---
I stopped playing, because I had no dailies/weeklies to do, because I had no interest in the Legendary Run.
---
Coming back when One Appalachia is released.
---
Got it

Are you using a specific build/perk setup if not you could be losing damage that way this not killing faster, depending on your weapon best to find or buy one with a legendary effect on it, bloodied is a very good effect. Westek is a good place to run through, super mutants give the best xp per kill. Also take any consumables to raise your int as xp is tied to that

Done?
---
Thanks so much
---
I do it as I've maxxed the factions rep and, despite protests from peeps, it's so dang easy to do. Jeez just eat gum, grab a bobblehead, claim a workshop and build 5 tables and you've basically done it all for a day. 
---
I decided to build a CAMP for like a week and didn't do any daily SCORE. I'm already halfway done and am yet to set foot into NW.
---
Seriously if none of the content appeals you ain't gotta do shit! Just go do your thing however you want :)
---
Don't do it then, you don't have to do certain challenges. Leveling up a new character doesn't take too long, but still not worth it for me. Yes I agree, we should have NW score challenges especially for a lot of us who don't play NW.
---
They probably think we going to login to NW and actually stay and play, I do the challenge and leave.
---
Just hold the "Touch" button and LL claim the workshop, dont need to find the workbench
---
Takes the same amount of time with or without tents. Just saying.
---
you know what id love? if your main character hits level 100 then you can start a alt character at level 50 with 49 new perk card/special points to assign. i only say this because when you used to make a separate character on gta online (not sure if they do this still) but youd have the option to either restart from scratch OR Start from level 50 or 100 (i cant remember witch one) but the point is you'd be able to have fun on a completely separate character without having to do 1000 missions with gerald or heists to just use the mini gun or rocket launcher at level 50 or 100, also if you could have a caps bank of some sort to transfer thru alternative characters would be op obviously. but again, who am i to tell bethesda how to run their game
---
+karma
---
Cool
---
This is my problem with seasons, it makes people want to do content that‚Äôs not exciting and miss out on the great stuff the game has to offer.
---
....... Worth it? Jury's out.
---
Hopefully you get some use from it.

Ac units in harpers ferry
---
Behemoths are so cool, just wish they were more common
---
Sorry for the late reply. 
---
So Grounded mutation doesn‚Äôt effect the Gauss Shotgun?
---
Yep, scrip locked.
---
Public teams are used for the buffs and team perks/mutations.
---
Join up and try to tag as many mobs as possible.
---
What if they give you a t-shirt....
---
Why would they build a new engine now? They haven't build one in almost twenty years. As long as it is possible to make games with this tech they will use it.
---
*"It takes ages to level up, and many people actually don't like the mode while having limited time to play."* Make a fresh toon, go to NW with him/her. Hide in a bush while watching a movie. Challenge completed with one game while afking. Delete and make a new toon for next challenge.
---
Definitely a big congrats. Every day is a struggle, but with some enough friends and ammo laying around you might not even notice!
---
Fast travel to Harpers Ferry. Go accross the bridge and follow the path to up the mountain. When you get near the top, go onto the grass and follow the cliff wall to your left. Just around the corner is a cave adorned by something that looks like hanging moss from skyrim. There are five aluminium nodes in there. Watch out for the Stalking mothman. It's one of his hangouts.
---
They're still using the bloody skyrim engine ffs...
---
I‚Äôve noticed that somtime my bowl gets completely emptied Given that I only made nukashine for the quest it‚Äôs nice having a place to dump the booze. But even at that it‚Äôs so rare that anyone bothers with it I‚Äôm seriously thinking of just deleting it and the coke machinr
---
Ahh just an atomic one like the others on the board
---
Everything I would want to say to them and more  üíö
---
And forgive us our trespasses, as I thought they only claimed the workshop for the daily and would forgive those who trespass on us
---
If you're on pc, I have a few I can give you
---
You didn't understand my system then. People also get 50000 Treasurey Notes. Can they do anything with it\`? No they are limited with 200 Gold bullion they can trade them for in.
---
I want 10000000 scrip rather then the mules and stuff. But can I do anything with it rather than spending more then 500 a day or so? No the same system but I'm clean and don't have a feeling that I have to drop everything and this whole game is usless or "horde" it.
---
...Morrowind engine.
---
‚ÄúUntil they build a new engine‚Äù
---
Let me know how that goes.
---
I really wish they hadn't added a super annoying radio dj to the game. I'd kill for another station with all the songs and no goddamn talking.
---
Yeah I never even look at the board unless I‚Äôm claiming the rewards. I never check the challenges I just play the game and stuff just pops up when I‚Äôve done something.  I‚Äôm at rank 45 now and I don‚Äôt even pay attention to it. From the get go I decided the rewards are not worth grinding for. I play casually and already have everything I wanted from the board minus the fireplace secret door. No need for me to grind. I actually enjoy the atoms, scrip, caps and gold rewards more than these crappy cosmetics that don‚Äôt even work apparently. I do like the game board idea I just don‚Äôt like any of these rewards right now, it‚Äôs like a bad atom shop week stretched over 10 weeks. Hopefully I‚Äôll like next seasons rewards. But to answer your question, no. I do not particularly care for the legendary run.
---
Yep. Also fought a 3\* legendary sheepsquatch while i was under-leveled and was rewarded with an Assassin's Pool Cue 1\*.
---
Same here I sell mostly the add on like jet pack and bracers.
---
Plastic or cotton?
---
Sure thing. When will you be online today?
---
Feel free to walk on past my level 6 1600 pound mule selling all my left over 3* Legendaries then.
---
Probably means he needs the same thing.
---
1000
---
What's cheaper?
---
What type of jumpsuits?
---
Sometimes if it‚Äôs one star I will sell if it‚Äôs worth a fair bit
---
He could be low level
---
People are complaining for good reason. It's not only that the Legendary Run is a terrible grind for bad rewards. It's that it replaced a system that directly rewarded you with Atoms. Atoms equal choice. With Atoms, everybody can get what they want. In the old system, if you didn't want to do a challenge then you just skipped it and it had no effect anything else you did. Now if you don't want to do a challenge then you fall behind and have to grind the repeatable. It's a system that is designed to frustrate players into spending money on Bethesda's player retention system. This system that's for their benefit is being sold as something for you that you can pay for. It's dishonest and they should be given the shit that they deserve to hear.
---
many thanks
---
Forest Camo, White Powder, BOS
---
The way around it but it's not ideal is to have more than one level 50. Each one having 150 scrip.
---
Using the new skin?
---
yeah, all these online gaming companies really dont care about mental health. honestly, somethings recently changed for me, i decided im done with all online games. rockstar is just as bad when it comes to promoting bullying, not AS bad with money greed. but realised i am and always will be an offline gaming gal. Decided to buy and play the real skyrim recently (enhanced version) and WOW is it a completely different experience to the online shit! it feels like either its a completely different team to the online games, or they sold their souls somewhere along the way!
---
Actually gauss mini is worse than many other guns because SBQ is immune to explosive, which is part of that gun.
---
is your school mascot a little blonde guy?
---
I had an idea a while back for an all ghoul cover band. They cover song and replace the word girl with ghoul. The singer has that raspy ghoul voice and all that. Songs like ‚Äòghouls, ghouls, ghouls.‚Äô ‚ÄòAre you gonna be my ghoul?‚Äô ‚ÄòGhouls!‚Äô ‚ÄòMy ghoul‚Äô Could even do ‚Äòuptown ghoul‚Äô.  I‚Äôm sure I had more but I‚Äôm still half asleep
---
Just wondering about the official word on this: are these challenges actually bugged, or didn't Bethesda simply leave them active because why not?
---
Thanks for the heads-up, my highest NW char is level 17 (I also only started NW because of the season challenges), and I received all other rewards except for the fur-lined jacket already. The beanie was a while ago, though, so I was a bit curious about that. I figure it doesn't take 14k XP over all, like with the other challenges, but 14k **after** unlocking the beanie, correct?
---
Only for PC in my opinion. On console there're no hacks or cheaters and if there are, it's so few. But that's coming from me who camps in a bush with the ghille suit.
---
Get good
---
Damn, I didn't even think about the high agility vs sneak. Now I've probably got the points I was looking for to move.
---
I guess it‚Äôs the same as going to a supermarket but completely avoiding the pet food section because you don‚Äôt have a pet. Other people do have pets though, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs there. I just hope for you that they improve the normal aisles so there‚Äôs more you‚Äôll be happy about in the future. Most people seem excited for the BoS content that‚Äôs coming in the future, which seems much more gameplay orientated.
---
I just gave mi second fixer plan away to some folk last friday
---
Oh I have all 5 full ... but that doesn't help crafting as that is character locked. I can mule things over and maybe roll for a new fixer or something, but crafting is a pain.
---
They probably will around thanksgiving.
---
Tears
---
no
---
Except melee damage foods. Those stack and are ridiculous.
---
some sort of fisting joke?
---
They will miss your 60 dollars
---
When I was scrapping railways to learn mods I noticed i accumulated over 3000 rail spikes. Is this a thing?
---
Revert back to the standard C.A.M.P. module until Bethesda fixes the future tec one.
---
The reward is rsi of the thumb.
---
I was using the slocum joe wallpaper and the two glow in the dark wallpapers from the legendary run, and the red rocket garage. Exterior on my main house is one of the metal walls, not the warehouse one the metal panel looking one. I don't believe its one of the shop walls.
---
And that means ?
---
And here I am, handing out free gum at my camp, and nobody wants it.
---
So how about listing some suggestions about what you had hoped would be in the season that isn't in there?
---
I'd prefer if they removed the caps, scrip, gold, fireworks, and scrap kits even at the cost of making the next season shorter. They're just there to make it take longer.
---
Instead, if they can't output more outfits/camp items, I'd take legendary rolls. Similar to how you get a token to pick a weapon/armor type in wastelanders, let it be more specific than the purveyor and be limited to 3 stars.
---
Correct. Halloween rewards were cumulative but not the Xmas ones.  It is bugged, the rewards were no longer obtainable after the sesonal events ended....until patch 20 screwed up and made them unlockable again.
---
Bethesda acknowledged they were messed up and said it will be fixed with the next patch so enjoy it and unlock what you can basically.
---
I need some water after reading that
---
Idk, i just know it gives mods
---
one of the items i wanted to get was the firefly jar and yep...when i finally got it.... disappointment :/ The illumination is nearly zero
---
I unlocked the giant plushie this morning and decided to stop after that. I didn't feel like chasing after legendaries anymore. The best thing I got out of the legendary run was that I respecced my character a bit to get more efficient and I'm quite pleased with my build right now.
---
You realize you still have like 5 weeks before the next patch and that's not even the next season.
---
Also subscribe to Fallout 2^nds to get all the sweet loot that other players lose through shitty glitches!
---
Gauss Minigun and the Ammo Creator
---
It can be annoying when the block feature doesn't actually block hackers/cheaters from your lobbies and it would be nice to be able to have all players start the match at the same time.
---
It‚Äôs not for everyone but it‚Äôs well done imo. I dislike battle Royales. I can‚Äôt play it for hours on end but it‚Äôs fun from time to time.
---
You've got like a good ten years before there's another fallout game anyway so you'll be waiting for quite a it yet.
---
Oh my gods, that was the one thing i forgot I had just gotten. I changed it back and it is showing again. Thank you so much!
---
You should also add Egg Head and Herd Mentality mutations, and join a public building Team. Herd Mentality has no negative effects as long as you are in a public team, even if the team consists of only you.
---
Furthermore, being either carnivore (tasty squirrel stew + broiled scorchbeast brain) or herbivore (brain fungus soup + cranberry relish) give you massive intelligence and XP boosts, as they now do double the effects of food.
---
You really downvote my post and my comment kinda sad tho
---
Thank you for not being an asshole and actually giving me an answer
---
I think it is probably worth it if you were grinding the tokens so you could have it as your character's outfit, or if you are an outfit collector and you collect one of each outfit. I could also see people getting disappointed with its appearance- less so now that they put Fuzzy Brenda at the entrance of Camden Park. Before Wastelanders, you would have to search online to see what the Mr. Fuzzy costume would look like before winning it. For anyone that would prefer a clean version of it instead of the 'heavily distressed' version, they're better off waiting for a clean Atom shop version. Personally, I think it would be neat if the just made a new quest chain at the park (once you 'unlocked' the original version) to earn the clean version- but that's just me.
---
I play nuclear winter sometimes and I wish they would change that daily back to perk cards as a reward
---
Yep. I've listed Fasnacht plans for 400 caps since the event started. I would say I had about 100 to sell, and I'm down to about 20 left.
---
Agreed. But unless others stand up and say this product is unacceptable, nothing will ever change. 
---
There are hundreds of thousands of unhappy players, millions more who've already quit. Message boards are flooded with horror stories of all kinds.
---
It's quite boring gamemode, and one of the worst battle royal game out there.
---
And what if the player doesn‚Äôt want this information shared?
---
I think 10 is a fair price. They sell really quick at that price
---
I dont really care too much about it. But its something to do while I wait for some meaningful content. Its keeping me busy, thats about all there is to it.
---
Since you're on pc, there's a mod for text chat linking to a third part server over tls. You can find it on nexua mods and requires another mod 'SFE'  just copy paste them into fallout install directory
---
PS: You can't play nuclear winter with the mods on
---
How can be so sure! /s
---
I think he wants you to go down on him
---
Ha man, well id you ever get a other on, I gladly buy it off from you.
---
They won't change it because they designed it that way with all those very tight limits to psychologically pressure you to feel like you need to log in every day (and week for the weekly challenges) when things reset so that you can't have one or two big days of getting a ton of stuff done and then taking a few days without playing and doing other stuff or playing other games.
---
It's been designed like a mobile game just like every other AAA online game now with daily/weekly challenge in game objectives stuff.
---
Someone who prowls...
---
If you're in the box I can give you mine because I don't use them and they don't sell at all
---
Yep, and chems too. I don't really use them, so I put them at half the suggested price. Someone usually buys  me out on a weekly basis for 1000 or so caps.
---
"Stop liking what I don't like"?
---
It's ok if you suck at it.
---
I'd like to be able to search all vendors for specific things. That'd be good!
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it then‚Äù. It‚Äôs not about doing it or not doing it. It‚Äôs about speaking out what you would like to see different in the game. Personal opinion, feedback, suggestions. They KNOW they don‚Äôt HAVE to do it.
---
I‚Äôll agree with that. 
---
Although, I do find it refreshing to play occasionally when I can be bothered to do the challenges for it.
---
I scrapped about 20, then became encumbered. Checked weight to see 700+ lbs and now 3000 spikes in ammo. Was odd.
---
when I've been in there its best to just burn it down anyways :-p
---
I like fireworks but we need the plans to build them ourselves, not just give us a few to play with.
---
Thank you! 1 ps card coming up!
---
What‚Äôs weird is I really like battle royales‚Äîlove Fortnite and Warzone‚Äîthis is just a horrible BR mode.
---
I did no such thing.
---
The problem I have with other rewards is, they're too low in quantity to make a difference. Especially bullion. 25 Gold? REALLY? What am I supposed to with that, cheapest plan costs 100 and those are always weapon attachments and other useless stuff. I'm going to play the entire season and all I got is enough for two weapon attachments? What the hell?
---
Scrip and Caps can be higher too of course but Bullion rewards are laughable. Perk Card packs are also laughable because they're not contributing much, especially if they don't add something to fasten legendary perk progression. Nobody is going to bother leveling up hundred times to level up one card once. If they were to turn those rewards into perk coin rewards and make them considerably bigger, like 20 perk coins or something or add something that functions as an amplifier for your card scrap gain, it may actually turn out good. Current perk card packs kinda suck, considering how they work.
---
Atomic Onslaught PA Skins and Ghillie Skins are pretty bad. When you buy a skin on Atomic Shop, you unlock it for all armors most of the time. Unlocking the same skin for different PA over and over again is stupid since everyone uses one or two different variants. Unlocking variants for PA I don't use does nothing for me. I don't think anybody uses T-45 or that newbies unlock the variant for T-45 just as they start using the armor itself, too much left in luck for those rewards to be meaningful. Different color palettes for one skin on the other hand, could actually be much better. For instance at rank 10, you unlock the black &amp; white variant of the Atomic Onslaught, at rank 30 you unlock the red &amp; blue variant, so on and so forth. This would only work of course, if they were to make an actual skin instead of a lazy color scheme though I don't think it would be too much trouble considering they're not bothered by the lore when it comes cosmetics. If I thought the engine would handle it well without introducing more bugs, I would also suggest some light effects for later unlocks, like "a glow in the dark PA" but the wallpaper seems to only glow in certain times of the day, independent of lighting. The engine either can't handles some dynamic effect like that without too much work or it would be buggy I think.
---
Also, Ghillie skin looks like a pile of shit left by a vegetarian dragon with stomach problems.
---
I never used them but I like the idea of fireworks. I would prefer to have a plan to make fireworks instead of being given a limited amount. I got 20 fireworks during the entire season and because they're limited, I keep them as souvenir. But if every season gave us new and different fireworks I would gladly use them.
---
Meaningful changes like this would make the season system worthwhile for me I don't think they require too much work on their part(except for testing of course but when does that not require too much work when it comes to FO76?)
---
Right. This is how I feel. I love BR modes and I love FO76. This is just an awful version of both.
---
They are good for SBQ completion.
---
Oh shit im so sorry Ive got you confused with another person Sorry
---
Depends in how serious you are about maxing honestly. There's a few cards you can get rid of if your trying to go full on, no QoL perks. Thats mostly for the PvP crowd though, from a PvE perspective thats a really solid build.
---
Let me challenge your view with this: I picked up 76 a bout 3 weeks ago and while the battlepass rewards maybe arent great for a level 200, I have really appreciated them. Was mad struggling to find enough adhesive to both repair and upgrade my guns, got 1,000 caps on the Battlepass, fast traveled to a player shop and was able to buy several bulk adhesive and other materials so I could continue enjoying the game. Later gained enough atoms to buy the pack of 10 repair kits, further increasing my enjoyment. As a lvl 17 I'm playing basically a different game from you, you are launching nukes and grinding scorch queens and I'm still exploring the game. So while caps, scrap, gold, and etc maybe useless to you, it makes my time going through more fun. It's a battle pass that's free, cruddy cosmetic items are pretty par for the course and I could truly care less about emotes and cosmetics. I'm not saying you're wrong or white knighting for the game or something, but maybe you should alter your expectations a bit. I have seen battlepass' on other games with far less content that are not free. I will say however: The Legendary Run is a TERRIBLE name. It's a Battlepass, just call a spade a spade, it's like trying to give a creative name to lootboxes.
---
Might try it, the few times i joined public team everyone remaim quiet, thanks for the advice anyway
---
Not the point of the thread, I‚Äôm asking people that enjoy the game mode to tell me why they like it. And of course I suck at it, I never play it. Not a lot of experience generally equals sucking at something.
---
I finished the run last Tuesday and have been in for most of the resets to see if mine would auto-complete, they haven't yet. I'm on PC and I'm not sure if anyone is compiling which platforms are having the most issues, although it could be anything that causes it. It's a shame it's still happening to so many people though.
---
I have more caps than I can count. If it comes to my hands I'd gladly give it to you. Xbox?
---
I just look at the amount of stuff they have. If they‚Äôre barely selling anything I don‚Äôt even bother unless its on the way to a destination
---
Sadly, I am on PC.
---
I do any dailies that don‚Äôt involve NW. usually takes 5-10 minutes.  I don‚Äôt really pay attention to the weekly challenges  until I naturally get close to them.  I just started over again on PC. So I‚Äôd rather explore and level then worry about a 100 tier battlepass with mostly filler rewards.
---
The only good thing is that secret door.
---
That‚Äôs messed up. If it was done on a credit or debit card you can contact the bank and file a report and get your money back. 
---
I personally only use prepaid Visa cards or ps cards for purchases if anything dealing with games. This way I can just load the amount needed and not worry. Might want to look into that as many now a days have no monthly fees.
---
I am on console fwiw. To be honest, I‚Äôm surprised it took this long to happen to me with all that I‚Äôve read lately.
---
I had a bunch of plans for free. Some doushnossle took them all. Even the duplicates. This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Still got em?
---
Or a hutch!
---
The game punishes those who like to play.
---
I'm brand new to the game as of last week, only 9 hours in. I get what you mean about the rewards seeming lack luster but as a new player these items are great for me. I think it gives us a really good starting point to grow out characters.
---
100% sure you'll get it. I've done the event about 25 times and got it twice
---
Yessssss
---
That‚Äôs my relationship too. And the score challenges have gotten me back into it. I‚Äôm almost not even mad at the match gameplay itself. It‚Äôs the UX surrounding it. Soooo much waiting.
---
It is. I have a few. The recoil is ridiculous though but in VATS it‚Äôs devastating.
---
the main reason is because u need to have at least 1 mutation before that perk inspirational works with team and low levels dont really know about mutations yet. But if youre more than 2 in the team who are mutated, it doesnt matter for the last 2 guys
---
That's more than a feeling. It's the reality. They designed the system to get you invested in it only to start dragging towards the end so that you'll spend Atoms.
---
I‚Äôm not even mad at the match gameplay itself,
---
That can be a lot of fun when the team cooperates and communicate. It‚Äôs the UX surrounding it. Soooo much waiting.
---
700 lbs of dead weight..they got dropped on the ground, sorry
---
Hulk Smash fail?
---
I‚Äôm not gonna tell you I made 6k just from ultracite plans but I will tell you I made over 25k+ this week from my vendors. That being said ultracite plans for armor are 25 caps each in my vendor. The mod plans are 65 unless it is something really useful. Everything sells at the right price. Not often but eventually someone will. Except .38 rounds nobody wants that shit.
---
Happens to the best of us mate, im just shocked its not patched yet
---
If you don‚Äôt already have and use the super duper perk in luck, I suggest getting and maxing it. Each time you craft a railway rifle (or anything else) you have a strong chance to get an extra each single crafting. Makes modding easier. Just finding RRs to scrap is not a common occurrence.
---
oh that's cool! I've found the mad hatter's tea party, a breaking bad scene, the pied piper, a ref. to lotso, caddyshack, teenaged mutant ninja turtles, two references from the movie the shining, and others from the office, pam's house (as well as lots of previous fallout games references), silence of the lambs, se7en, angry birds, skyrim, a pair of chatbots, and movie references to UP and toy story. I've tried to screencap many of the others, but there are quite a few I run across and realize they're a reference to something I can't figure out so I take screencaps and try to solve them offline too.
---
Just got took by yns561 for my bloodied fixer 25/25 and my mutants fixer....
---
  I don't understand why people do this kinda stuff. 
---
He was literally getting the better deal anyways.
---
  Was trading for a bloodied handmade explosive and a bloodied handmade 25/25. 
---
  Its pointless to even try. Nobody can be trusted.
---
I‚Äôm fairly new and it‚Äôs just a bonus, not a focus at all
---
They obviously want the seasons to be longer with as little workload as possible on their part. I would like them to at least keep Gold Rewards as long as they increase the quantity. 250 extra gold bullion for a 50 to 100 hour grind is a joke. 
---
Cap and Scrip rewards may not mean much for us veterans but I think they do for newbies who don't know how farm things. Seasons shouldn't be for people like us only. They should welcome new players so I think they should stay.
---
On a PC it seems the system can be gamed a bit.  I haven't crafted enough for a proper pool (I didnt need too) so this may all be placebo but what I have noticed is...Some servers seems to have 2 prefixes they "favor".  Craft 4 or 5 if you see a streak of stuff you don't want with 2 or 3 of those being the same then hop and repeat until either you see its not repeating prefixes or you get repeats of the prefix you want.  Maybe it only works this way for me because of a seed tied to my account or something but I have heard others speak of the same voodoo, nothing to lose by trying it.
---
You're welcome
---
It doesn‚Äôt help that when you die there is no chance of respawn like more recent br games and it takes another 10 minutes to get into another game
---
Obvious, if you really take the time to read and understand my comment...
---
Fully stealing this idea.
---
Pretty sure you get up to a 3 star for a 3 star legendary, upto a 2 star for a 2 star legendary,and 1 star for a 1 star legendary 
---
, a 3 star legendary has never been a guarantee for a 3 star drop 
---
. Sucks but it is what it is
---
I think you just answered a question for me. I had a teammate last night that I saw was in a silo and got excited knowing a nuke was coming. But then a little later I saw he left the team and figured he just had to quit playing but then I saw he launched the nuke a bit later. I bet he was doing just what you said in regards to the quest.
---
The instigating version is a beast, delivers high damage and it's pretty accurate. It's a vats weapon tho
---
I do it, but I will not have a heart attack if i don't finish rank 100
---
I've actually started to like it on XB1, but just for the fact I play it like it's Hide n' Seek. I hardly even participate in combat. If I got killed, that means someone found me.
---
I just open the ungodly amount of perk packs I have and free gum!
---
Get one on the trade-sub no problem 8k/10k
---
I‚Äôd rather people be able to name the camps so people can give an idea of what to expect
---
You know they're going to reserve the best stuff for the Shop.
---
This has actually done the opposite for me
---
People with lots of plans usually end up being mountains of ‚Äúmounted animal‚Äù shit, because they stack and don‚Äôt fill the 30/30 items
---
That is a very weak excuse. ü§£ they are like that because they are awful human beings. If being picked on too much is your excuse for being a bully, you need therapy more than anyone else who was picked on. 
---
- someone who was picked on so much they had to be homeschooled for 2 years
---
Or do them "in addition to", like get a CAMP item, armor or weapon skin *plus* caps, scrip, bullion etc.
---
Maybe you should make a post that says that, instead of an inflammatory bait headline.
---
Nice
---
I would hate her a lot less if she didnt have her 15 hour sob story. I'm here to listen to some tunes, not a podcast.
---
The combat is actually pretty fun, I‚Äôve found. The mechanics that GET me to the combat is what‚Äôs frustrating. Even with all the perks, only being able to sprint for a few seconds is obnoxious. Alllll the waiting, not queuing for the next match automatically, etc.
---
I don't think its quite that bad, but it definitely feels like a side note stuck on to the main game. Doubt it will ever stack up against games that primarily focus on pvp/Battle Royale
---
Pre-fabs is my # 1, but I know they won't take them away from the Shop.
---
Don't know if there is a good answer.  I've found nuked flora long after a nuke had come and gone before.  I've also been in a nuke zone that was a few minutes from clearing up and the plants were no longer mutated.  Does not seem super consistent in my experience.
---
It‚Äôs about once a week for me.  From my experience it has little to do with being logged out, but more so if I crash, have to back out due to infinite load screen, etc.  Basically if I load in successfully after the reset I am usually fine.  What I e done is make sure you actually have your system powered down and or make sure you completely quit out of fo76.  That last part seems to be key for me at least.
---
Remember that you don't have to use repair kits to repair your weapons or armour! You can repair them on a workbench and use junk you've looted.
---
Game is pretty bad overall. More news at 8 ;)
---
I read sonewhere a guy that always carry one nukashine on him at all times. if he‚Äôs overemcumbered far from a place he fix the situation, he than drinks his nukashine. genius.
---
WTF? xD
---
the ammo converter is pretty bad aswell its so slow to use and the conversion rates are kinda poor a slight increase in ammo recived or a reduction in points cost and not removing us from the convert to points back to the menue every time we convert would be good
---
For like 5 seconds of work at my camp you get all legendaries for 10 caps each
---
Why would you buy repair kits at all? Collect scrap to repair your weapons and armor. At level 16 you probably should be looting guns off your kills rather than repairing them.
---
Well, all that Tick Blood Tequila and Canned Meat Stew has to be disposed of somehow.
---
-Kill 1 creature in NW
---
me: not bad, i never play it but i can manage that for sure
---
*next day*
---
-Kill 9 creatures in NW
---
me: ??? no thx
---
Oh, I actually had a whole bit about what I mean in the body of the post. I‚Äôm just realizing that‚Äôs not in the post so I just have made a mistake somewhere submitting the post. Good feedback, I‚Äôll revise.
---
Yo turn into a behemoth
---
Oh, cute, another shill post.  Surprise surprise, bethesda didn't have to take away our ability to earn atoms at a good pace from the daily/weekly challenges, but they did, so... Nice try though.
---
Lol you‚Äôre good. Bethesda Games Studios. Little bit easier than just saying Bethesda every time
---
And later you can get the repair kits for free from The Scorched Earth event. So don't use your hard earned Atoms on those!
---
Thanks! Whenever I go to a workbench and hit modify/repair it says that I have nothing to modify/repair even though I do. Can you only repair things that still have CND?
---
Just make a ticket and then u at least tried
---
It's not an airport dude, you don't need to announce your departure
---
I can get that challenge done more quickly than I can the 'kill 5 creatures' challenge. Out of my 4 characters, I take whichever one is the lowest rank in for that challenge, and knock that one out quickly. But, the challenges to seek out creatures seems to take forever. 
---
"Kill 3 Creatures" is enough, especially when the previous 'Kill 5' and "Kill 10" were the same SCORE values of 250 points, really Bethesda?
---
I need the chicken coop and firebug lantern though. ._.
---
Dunno exactly how accurate it is, but info I've seen in the past states the whole nuke thing lasts ~4 hours. 2-2 and a half hours as an actual nuke site with rads, and another hour and a half-2 hours with nuked flora etc when the actual red zone has dissipated. 
---
The nuke time seems fairly consistent in my experience, the odd times I've stayed and hardcore farmed the mats from mobs the entire time. 
---
I have no solid experience with the flora after the fact personally, as once I've hoovered up all I want it never respawns even if the visual model reappears, so I don't really check. It's difficult to gauge as sometimes the script to switch the flora to nuked versions doesn't work fully and you'll find normal plants right next to flux versions for instance.
---
It'd take more investigating than I'd be prepared to do for nothing other than curiosity sake. I assume a lot of people feel the same, but maybe some dilligent soul has done so somewhere.
---
Watch the reload animation the next time you use it, it clips badly.
---
I guess you need demolition expert because you are using a Bloodied Explosive gun?
---
Even with a tent the scrap kits are useless. I much rather manage the amount of each type of junk that goes in my STASH myself because of the 800 limit
---
&gt;Well cosmetics are optional
---
Lol, they should just be unlockable in the game, it is not free to play.  Also, There's nothing "optional" about games that are designed around psychologically pressuring you towarda microtransactions to get the cosmetic ls you want in a game you already paid for.  The "cosmetic only" or "optional" arguments fail.  Good try though.
---
I thought I was lucky too then I was hit the night before last, only thing different I did was the night before the auto complete I logged in briefly with my Alt to play NW and do the overseer rank up score challenge then logged back in with my main into adventure mode. I can‚Äôt help but feel this is the same bug that used to get me when it was atoms as that used to happen to me when I played NW when it first came out. Anyway for the time being I‚Äôm not going to use my Alt or play NW and see if both those things keep the bug at bay.
---
Thank you! Here's the link to the PNG file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/14rTa27ohp7CmgV4TRHkzmS1y75L7jnDA/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14rTa27ohp7CmgV4TRHkzmS1y75L7jnDA/view?usp=sharing)
---
PA perfectly fits the slot between regular armors and Legendary armors..
---
its got good DR.. you can prance around in nuke zones.. you can fall off the highest places in the world and live and if your STR is under 11 it will raise your carry weight..
---
PA as is.. is pretty great...
---
Same here... All plans 90% off, xbone, whitesprings red rocket diner
---
Maybe but it couldn't be the same effects as it would be OP over everything. It would need to be carefully thought out and Bethesda doesn't have a great track record balancing perks and legendary effects in my opinion.
---
Or avoid my level 100+ in the forest who's selling stuff suitable for every level from "fresh out of the vault" to "hasn't done anything else but play the game since it came out."
---
Your camp module can be placed somewhere and they should spawn in a vicinity of it. There's YouTube videos on it
---
I came here for the sarcasm. I was not disappointed.
---
Not to the extent morrowind did, though tbh I think morrowind overdid it considering you could only ever see like 10 feet in front of your face
---
I hope bethesda constantly records new dialogue of her, maybe she can reference comments made about her on here that she could turn into some actual feedback. Could feel engaging
---
Im also on Xbox, GT:TheTinman7145 I can give you a new card and/or help you run the silo. Sorry that happened to you.
---
It only has a chance to drop from the signal strength quest. You can only run that quest once per char. To farm it, I had to run new chars on an alt account through that quest over and over to get it. It is nonsense.
---
Nope. Best plan of action is place camp and before you build FT away and back a couple of times to see where you drop in.
---
Yes, Wastelanders changed it for me too. I bought the game at launch but played sporadically because the world seemed so dead, I lost interest. But Wastelanders brought me back big time and I haven't stopped playing since.
---
Pacifist mode?
---
They defiantly need to improve end game but in my opinion I wouldn't like the buffs, to me would be pointless. I've spent more hours then I'd like to say grinding for my 5 piece all matching unyielding set and bloodied meathook, ain't nothing that's gonna change my build now haha.
---
? Obviously i have that on but the noobs are not so lucky. Kind of missing the whole point of my post but never mind.
---
Just revisiting my old post.
---
You know like occasionally you get a bugged mob that just stands there and takes damage then instaheals. I was testing a few rifles out on a super-mutant that way. It's the kind of thing it would be cool to get from a shooting range
---
Of course I mean one that works in lore and isn't an obvious bug. For example maybe you have a protectron that is programmed to mimic whatever type of enemy you want to set it to, has a few amusing lines and shows damage numbers. Set it to be a supermutant and it will be painted green and wear supermutant clothes while saying standard supermutant lines in a protectron's voice.
---
There's still some things that can't easily be assessed by some numbers, such as  recoil. You may have a weapon with a decent damage per shot and good fire rate but poor recoil means you can't realistically land a sequence of shots on target unless it's a large target.
---
‚ÄúHaha I don‚Äôt even want human relationships I‚Äôm so relatable‚Äù
---
He sure does, I‚Äôve got more gum than I‚Äôll ever use
---
Yeah though I find it weird that tri-barrel is better on Miniguns (though it doesn‚Äôt hurt fire rate as much) but charging barrels are bad.  I was just wondering how one does negative damage. Mine with charging barrels has a fire rate of 60 so I assume that is roughly 1 shot every second.
---
*normal do do do do- dodododo...* *turns into atomic shop music*
---
Man, an advice: if you're not role playing, don't buy junk items from player vendors, there are many ways to quickly farm almost every material. Especially adhesive. Planting crops you can make adhesive from is basically the best thing you can early in game as you won't be focused too much on camp and will have a lot of camp budget unused.
---
I‚Äôd rather not change your mind. Not when having frog legs and grenade launchers guarantees your victory.
---
You want a door you got a door. No payback required.
---
They said they are tweaking with things. I think this is wrong just like nerfing! It is forbidden for us to cheat, but it is totally ok if Bethesda does it. Changing the rules in the middle of any game is Cheating!
---
Yep me too, ive got 26 regular gum, let alone the cola, strawberry, watermelon etc
---
That would be really nice. They could potentially even add camp plans like a ‚Äúwild vegetation garden box‚Äù so it would be something valuable to work towards
---
Edit: I literally didn‚Äôt notice the comment above that said basically the same exact thing
---
It's a 2hr clock for the nuke zone, but I suspect any picked flora has the clock reset which would explain why it's possible to find it after the zone has timed out. So in theory a max of 4 hrs total but few zones are revisited after the initial battles so usually much less and 2.5-3hrs is probably a more practical time.
---
People saying "don't do it" or "make a toon" to level up simply don't get it. 
---
Shouldnt have to make a new toon because the daily is horse shit for a game mode i dont even want to play. 
---
I know I can make a new toon to complete in one session by just sitting on the outer circle twice. But I simply would rather literally not play NW at all. 
---
"Just miss out on the points" I already am tbh. But still doesn't mean I won't criticize how poor a choice it is to make playing NW for dailys a thing.
---
Yeah, I agree but it would at least give you something different to play around with , I‚Äôm no expert by any means but the only fixes for endgame I can see Bethesda implementing are ones that don‚Äôt require a lot of work, effort or expense on their part , any ideas or recommendations ? because I love this game but don‚Äôt want it to go stale
---
Which I find unfortunate because there really is a good game in there, somewhere. E.g. a larger map with more players, add in workshop control/take overs, more/more dangerous AIs, etc
---
You can repair fully broken ones and those which have CND. 
---
You have to repair weapons on weapons workbench and armour on armour. It does not mass repair everything, you have to choose which item you want to repair.
---
This definitely, if they can‚Äôt explain something over emojis or soundless text it isn‚Äôt worth the effort.
---
My wife and I play together in a party in different rooms of the house and we still don‚Äôt use our mics.
---
Just not enough things that require that type of involvement, maybe a few events sure but that‚Äôs it.
---
Thanks! GT is name, I'm on now
---
Luck and super duper don‚Äôt effect crafting bullion Armor or weapons. I have a full SS unyielding set, not all three star but achieved in less than 50 modules. Super duper never worked and my luck is only at 6, yet one day I got both leg pieces in roughly 15 modules. It‚Äôs all RNG when it comes to these items, I don‚Äôt think any perks/stats change the outcome
---
Getting family involved is always fun.  Last night I had my gf laughing when I took on a wendigo colossus
---
Who is that, the Riddler? Nice avatar
---
That's a bit hit and miss, because you don't know where the heck you're going to be and then you're just as likely to wind up just as far from anything as where you were. 
---
Source: Tried this before.
---
Everyone I know that was ‚Äúbanned‚Äù was allowed to keep all the gear they duped. I think that‚Äôs pretty soft.
---
I think it's like:
---
1 Food
---
1 Drink
---
1 Chem
---
I'm almost always near the weight limit, so I use the following to fast travel:
---
Grilled RadStag (+20 carry weight)
---
Whiskey (+2 STR, triple effect if you have lvl2 Party Boy)
---
PsychoBuff (+3 STR)
---
What 2 things do you need
---
Magic two star shotgun? Angry Turtle did a video about it a couple of weeks back I believe.
---
I might do this as well tbh be nice to build it up a bit and let someone else have it
---
I dont rely on vats in pvp and never said I did. If vats was fixed then people wouldn't be using stealthboys 24/7.  It would be nice to use my handmade in pvp again.
---
What effect is the second star?
---
I personally would love to see legendary PA come out eventually. Heck, I'd be content if you had to know the plans for the parts you wanted and had to craft them like the gold bullion items
---
The bobblehead perk sucks. It beeps anytime you‚Äôre in a spawn point for a bobblehead regardless of if it‚Äôs actually there
---
Just like some real game boards, there should be shortcuts that cut across those bends in the track lol.
---
It's great. I'm not a water wookie anymore, I'm a scuba diver.
---
none, just an asterisk on browser.
---
Funny. I had my most memorable match yesterday with my 4yo watching for the first time. I was able to find a PA, launch a nuke, kill 6 people and win the match. Everything for the very first time. Not much into BR but play it just for the dailies. Son said I won because of the mothman dance before the match.
---
What‚Äôs the second star on the 2star?
---
My first wendigo was in a locked door and i was staring through the window, until it glitched through the wall and scared me shitless
---
Lol too funny
---
He's probably got a good point.
---
https://youtu.be/AHu4CErJXU4
---
Found it. Ok, so it was a couple of months ago. I'm old and lost my concept of time.
---
Cool. Joining you now.
---
It's because of the camp skin.
---
I'm still part way through the first section myself.
---
That's a brilliant idea that I'm totally going to steal.
---
Some rewards are shared by all characters (account connected) and some others are tied to the specific character you are using at the moment of claiming.
---
Its because of the new skin. Its bugged and will prevent your camp icon showing up. 
---
Only way to change the skins is to deselect it in the atom shop then move your camp.
---
Then don't play NW then?
---
Oh Jeeze I can‚Äôt stand fortnite. War zone is ok
---
Somebody dropped a bag of fusion/plasma cores in my garage, that was nice
---
Go to Big Bend Tunnel, in the tunnel behind the main interior room in the center of the tunnel, there's a bunch of Aluminum veins down the edges. 
---
If you just want to get some Aluminum Ore fast, FT to Fort Defiance, and turn around toward the cliff. Jump up there, and there's three Aluminum Ore veins there.
---
It gets you gum, but it‚Äôs also the fasnacht protectron. 
---

---
The VTU baseball cap or Responders Fireman gear. I sold some of that a while ago without knowledge of what I had.
---
I've seen this same behavior. RNG in practice means you can see streaks like this since streaks are possible in random number generation.
---
The only real legendary effect on armor is Unyielding, maybe Life-Saving and Vanguard. PA gets an automatic 50% damage reduction along with a few other perks so it makes it way better than any other effect besides Unyielding. I play a bloodied power armor heavy weapons build. Stabilized and Emergency Protocols are really good and makes PA worth it over Unyielding except for the insane experience gains, I'm still a little jealous of that
---
I dont know if you're trolling or not lol I literally said I dont. Still doesn't mean I can't criticize how poor of a challenge it is.
---
You'll live.
---
Although, if you are on PC, I want to know who's spreading those PA paints all willy nilly. üëÄ
---
Thank You very much. Really appreciate Your quick response.
---
This is the best way.
---
Agreed!!
---
I really want the Responder signs like the one outside Flatwoods church.  
---
I definitely think we need more faction stuff.
---
How about place able cars, trucks, tractors,  motorcycles,  etc?? They would look cool.
---
One other prefab I would like is the large barn/sheds all over the map. Similar to Dane Roger's compound.
---
I'm ok with scrap kits. It's the basic repair kits that get me. I've got ... dunno ... 100 of the ones from the queen? I pretty much only use those to repair, and I cant keep the number down without junking them. Basic kits i cant gift to newbies, they are just insta junk.
---
We all know about the atoms situation?
---
I'm one of the new Game Pass players. What's going on?
---
I do my own thing, and if it gets me SCORE then so be it, and I do check the Daily and Weekly to see if there are easy ones to get (like chewing gum), but I'll never grind for all of them, and I will never do the NW challenges.
---
Is that the same responders fireman gear you get from the questline?
---
That is awesome. You rock, thank you!
---
I wouldn't ever buy repair kits. Keep collecting mats, and repair them yourself. You'll eventually get perks that let you repair to 200% durability, and get improved repair kits from the scorch beast queen.
---
Save your Atoms for better things.
---
cant get auto completed if you arent logging on at all üòé
---
Evasive s not worth it with the way DR works, Dodgy, on the other hand, is excellent if you don't mind trading AP
---
I cant respawn, i have to alt f4 fo76 and relaunch to be able to respawn, and waiting just ends up in the imposters corpse despawning
---
I will look into it! Definitely was a case of "I dont want to stop questing to farm, I just wanna repair my shotgun and continue with the game" it was worth the 15 caps for 3 bulk adhesive at the time. And as I said it was from the free 1000 caps on battle pass
---
Look Im not trying to sound "sketchy", I just ask if anyone had experienced the same thing so lets just leave it at that.
---
I think some of the Responder signs were part of an Atomic shop package. 
---
I saw a data mine that included some vehicles and done medical gear like the hospital gurney. So I left those out. But yeah those would be good attentions
---
Feck yeah dude! Video games have done wonders for my social anxiety. For me, it's always amazing to see/hear of people becoming better, more confident, or improving themselves because of the games they play.
---
All I want is for someone to sell flux
---
You shouldn't have hit him back ü§°
---
Yes, you nailed it.
---
That's what she said
---
Doom (2016) had a corpse wearing the "skyrim horns" helmet with an arrow stuck in his knee. IIRC, there's also a vaultboy figure.
---
Not the fire breathers stuff. There is another rare variety you get randomly from doing early responders quests or from forest dailies.
---
yeah, that would be helpful to separate from junk, same with armor and clothing.
---
maybe he shouldn‚Äôt have attacked my camp in first place?ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
The need more maps and game modes. I don't hate it but it's tiring waiting in the lobby so much.
---
Granted I'm not good at it and die frequently , but isn't there modes in other games where you just respawn?
---
Only one vendor I‚Äôve found selling flux, and it wasn‚Äôt the flux I needed
---
I'm so sorry to break this to you. those tokens were duped into the millions, I myself had over 20k, I have friends with those said millions :( I'm glad you finished your grind though
---
I'm glad people are starting to see PA is super strong as is. I switched away from an Unyielding Leather melee/shotgun build for a Strangler Heart heavy weapons build. Even after the nerf the build is just as strong as the other except I notice I have way less AP and EXP
---
You see, that's what I thought was brining me back to the game. But I've been specifically avoiding wastelanders missions to save them for last, and I've still been having an amazing time with the older content. I think it's my super positive experiences with the community that make it so much fun, and obviously you don't see anyone talk about that kinda stuff on a Bethesda hate video.
---
I hate Dr. Zorbo and all the FOMO he's causing
---
I have all the responder stuff that was in the atom shop. There were just some cool things they never included, like those signs.
---
Yes, when I have a bunch of 1 stars I drop them by the wayward too. Dead weight for me, hard to farm script for them.
---
keep vendor hopping, I usually find some every now and then. otherwise farm yourself and/or join all queen nukes.
---
When I pass things between mules on my private server, I just drop the stuff on the ground outside the Wayfarer.  What is the advantage of using a cigarette box?
---
Me a level 0 and teammate a level 1 won a NW match playing alts yesterday. How do I know teammate was an alt? Because he had the sloth icon.
---
Salty much? You must be the foodie who's base I blew up last night. Go back to your moms basement and play roblox or some shiii.
---
I‚Äôd like to farm it as well but it‚Äôs been a while since I last saw a queen nuke
---
He‚Äôs only ever attacked me on my low level acc, which sucked because I couldn‚Äôt kill him and he just kept following me around shooting me
---
Yes.  I got tired of the grind early on.  I'd rather have Atoms to buy exactly what I want as opposed to tonnes of shit I'll never use.
---
I think you can use those for some of the underarmors to make the shielded versions, in addition to ultracite ammo. 
---
If you're trying to get rid of them, put them in your vendors for 80 caps each, someone will probably come and buy them from you.
---
I have 5 of them and they are amazing! The recoil with automatic on is a kicker but the TSE and a Quad explosive rifles are just so tasty!
---
Strangler Heart PA was the dev's try at legendary PA. Imo it was a pretty good shot. They broke it when they nerfed it but it still works sometimes
---
Alright, so I tried that event twice yesterday with multiple other players, and both failed. So tell me your secrets to success!
---
You know, I for one like the new things in 76. All people seem to do is bitch about everything this game company does! Most developers would have pulled the plug on this game! I mean, face it, it‚Äôs on fucking Gamepass and STILL is practically empty of players! I liked this game when it came out and I liked the Wastelanders additions and I like the Legendary Run path too! Quit griping about everything or just find something else to bitch about all the time! Nobody‚Äôs holding a gun to your head and making you play 76!
---
Nothing like that in the game, which is good because if somebody wanted to spawn players that visit their camp and have them drop down into a bunch of spiked punji boards in order to steal their junk items, they would be able to.
---
Gotcha! Yeah anything in the game from the start should have plans for us to make.
---
Right, I could see legendary components/mods being added at some point but PA is already strong as hell.
---
But honestly,  nothing competes with unyielding armor as far as bonuses go... 
---
I just don't want PA to be so good that it's mandatory.
---
You just suck at the game you food build. Get a life
---
I think I went straight to level 3.  It's probably better to die before the final 10 so you stay low for the next time unless you're just planning on deleting the character anyway.
---
thats not a bug.. 
---
instanced inreriors will only progress the team leaders quest..
---
there is a tooltip stating such in the loading screens..
---
Bethesda: Sure, okay. Here's a cool skin for the Fat Man! You're welcome!
---
The run is okay. The PA skins and bush wookie skin have no use to me the one gun skin I am interested in is bugged or something like that. Other than that I am here for some of the camp items.
---
i use mic with a couple friends ive made in game but just to chit chat while we roam. the game doesnt rly require communication for game play stuff
---
I have to agree, I‚Äôm def not overly a fan of all the unlocks, but just look at it like this, rewards for playing the game. Yea sure we have to certain things to unlock the score points. But a majority can be done in a single session, realistically it takes 20 ish mins to complete the dailies. I‚Äôm ok with it, I also am a smidge selfish and expect bigger things lol.
---
I'm burnt out too and sad about it. I really wanted the fireplace and I'm only 9 spaces behind that guy but ugh. This is ruining my escape time.
---
I like your outfit choices and how the vision is refined through time
---
1000, if you scrip anything or earn anything that will exceed the limit, you‚Äôll lose it.
---
I gave up on the SCORE.  When I play if I happen to unlock something than great, otherwise I dont sweat it.
---
Ya, I always felt like the generic version of every item should be a plan in game. Then make the clean/premium skins and models be atom shop stuff.
---
They could have easily done this with the fridge, collectron bots, and other controversial stuff. But what do I know? Lol
---
I wonder why it is that so many people die right at the end of this event.. to the point that there are almost daily threads complaining about it..
---
I wonder what it is about this event that kills so many people right at the climax...
---
Yeah, the waiting for matches is the main reason I don‚Äôt give it my time. 
---
For people with limited play time, it‚Äôs not very good
---
Upvote for your pain alone.  My high score is 65 so you beat me!!üôÇ
---
I may have one for you.
---
Why don‚Äôt they just make it so you can only place it on the ground though because then it can‚Äôt be trapped?
---
I 100 percent agree I'm done already I did cheat slightly ( I use atoms for the last 15 instead of the 10 I said I would) I had a lot of fun and now that I'm done I'm a little said it's over and rdy to see what they come up with for next season.
---
Be handmade, yes
---
He's my favorite bot.  All the sweets are great for extending the jetpack
---
Thing is, with adhesive, you don't farm in terms of grinding, you actually do farming in the general sense. You plant crops: tato, mutfruit and corn. If you plant a lot(and you can, since you probably have a lot of space in your camp rn) you can simply pick them(with Greenthumb perk in Perception to get 2x) and make adhesive at the bench every time you come home. You'll have a lot of adhesive that way. 
---
My second advice is this: if you have a lot of surplus caps you're looking to spend, take a look at player vendors, if one has many "misc" items to sell go check it out to see whether that player is selling mutation serums. Take a look at a mutations guide beforehand and know which ones to get. Buy them and keep them in stash until you can get Starched Genes perk to level 2 which makes your mutations permanent as long as you keep it equipped. 
---
Or if you're on PC, you can add me and I'll give you tips. I'm bored of grinding lol.
---
If you wait like ten minutes you can respawn and still get rewards but I usually say "fuck that" and close app
---
Yeah I like the idea of different levels of quality for items. Pristine, clean, used, or damaged.
---
Couple months is still a few weeks depending how far you want to push the word "few"
---
That shits hurted
---
are you shitting me...
---
could you explain further in detail please?
---
if you're below, say 50 it should be only a few games, making a new character and starting level 0 you can finish it in 1 match though
---
You need to collect ore and protect the people. Most only protect the people and no one gets any ore. Next time man up and get radiated.
---
How do you use atoms to advance, I can't see on the board where it gives you the option!!!!!!
---
That's a long time request and one I wish they would do
---
Why in gods name do challenges like this one even exist? I mean u dont have to be super crative to come up with something better...
---
For what is the person in charge even payed for?
---
If you're gonna complain that much then dont play it. This is your second post about NW and how unfair it supposedly is. If you cant accept a loss then dont play it. Plus I 1 shot people almost everytime when I land a shot on then with a scoped lever action. I hit for over 400 on a headshot without phsyco. If you have the right perks then you shouldnt have a problem. If pvp ain't for you then go back to adventure mode.
---
I'm a bloody build, so I'm already 80% radiated :)
---
&lt;JackNicholsonNodding.gif&gt;
---
Level 218 and still no dice here! Congrats bud!
---
Why soon 250? Shouldn't it be 750 soon?
---
We had that briefly at the BETA so they can do it
---
Probably not but also yes.
---
The wastelanders update is free and will give you a few hours of enjoyment (depends if you are casual or hardcore) but almost everything that came with wadtelanders is cgaracter bound and will take you a solid 3 months of daily grinding to obtain. Other than working towards thst and the current seasonal score is the same old grind.
---
I'm not paying attention to the score thing at all. When the game tells me to unlock a reward I do, of course, but other than that I could not care less.
---
We need a mega thread for Easter eggs
---
Just loose the radiation and get in there. Gives you a lot of room for more radiation. I'm a bloodied build and I can do just fine.
---
Im not really chasing it.. most challenges Im getting just by playing normally..
---
I mean yeah.. if I see that the only daily left is like taking a workshop(which I would never normally do) I might grab one right before I log off but in general Im not even looking at the list but maybe once a day
---
consequently Ive only made it to the mid 40s so far..
---
Ya, makes no sense as it would have avoided the pay to win controversy with those types of items. 
---
Like selling the generic collector bot and then selling the unique ones like the Raider or Commie one for 500 atoms. Again total missed opportunity.
---
I personally love the season rewards but I respect your opinion.
---
&gt; instanced inreriors will only progress the team leaders quest..
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; there is a tooltip stating such in the loading screens..
---
What are you talking about? Lmao. I use 1st person all the time and get around 10 wins a day. It ain't hard to play in 1st person. If you're getting killed by vats grenade then you probably werent gonna win from the start. You should easily be able to stim out of any grenade. From plasma to nuka.
---
Yeah, when I died, I just left it idle for about 10 mins, then I could respawn. Got my loot!!
---
Damn you made me click.   Curse youüôÇ
---
The OPs on PS4 and there arent hackers on console. I know there are on PC but not on console.
---
it's quite easy to get if you have a partner in crime. Last time i found the vendor bot i managed to get several hunters long coats plus several longshoreman and clean spacesuits
---
How does that take away from the fact that the OP got the outfit legit?
---
I wish they would just remove nuclear winter dailies altogether. It's the most imbalanced and poorly designed battle royale I've ever played.
---
this happened to me yesterday. didnt know you gotta wait that long, i waited 2 mins and just turned off my ps4 then went to bed ü§ï.
---
hurts you maybe.. grounded mutation and 2 pieces of TS armor keep me alive just fine.. albeit with liberal stim spamming
---
I am on PC but I'm on gamepass, so I dont think I can play with steam accounts. Is the starched Gene's perk endurance? Thanks for the tips, will definitely look into mutations!
---
The rewards could be better, but I prefer this system to the old one. I almost exclusively log in for dailies atm and it still feels like I'm working towards something a bit more than an arbitrary currency.
---
It's their first for multiplayer overall so some of it has to be expected
---
Put 'em in your vendor for 100 caps each -- they'll be gone in an hour.
---
You can do Davenport's Quests from the Overseer's Home, where you photograph The Crater and sell those pictures to Ward at Foundation for Settler Reputation. 
---
Assist the Settlers during Faction fights when you see them, check at [Marigold Pavilion](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Marigold_Pavilion) or Slocum's Joe in the forest for events like that where you can help the Settlers. [Check this map for the little blue dots](https://imgur.com/ID0ergG), all of those places have a chance to spawn events where you might earn Settler Rep.
---
Go talk to Ward in Foundation, and do their daily quest. 
---
Those are really your only options to build reputation with the Settlers, aside from a few other random encounters you might have where you can give a settler some supplies, or help a settler kill some possums which is on that map with the blue dots.
---
I like dying in NW &amp; not having anything useful on my corpse - Because near the end of it all every resource counts &amp; I leave My Killer with nothing to help them in the final stages... I love that feeling.  I Love being of no help at all.  I made them use vital Ammunition on my demise &amp; was Zero Return on that investment.  Feels Good Man.
---
You spawn north of your module. It maybe NW or NE but north of it. I messed around with mine recently and got a nice spot.
---
I await the day when mannequins are added so I can expand my display to show my collection of outfits.
---
Would you be happy if a random teammate could decide how your story went for you? 
---
That's the logic behind it.
---
yep, it was almost worth the original grind back pre-nerf. i'm not going to give up my suit of it though.. unless they allow me to craft parts of it with Legendary prefixes on it. 
---
though only time will tell if they allow us to make legendary power armor parts, or not. but id still love to see it
---
I have a full time job. Not much of a social life with covid, and I'm not having any issues progressing.  But isn't the point of season pass for players that you know.... actually play daily?
---
From my point of view, DE is a bit of a 3 slot perk sacrifice just for one certain gun. With bloodied and commando you should be delivering enough damage. Also explosive has his issues, for exmple it's useless against the queen
---
All of the rare clothing items have a very small chance of dropping from every event (I had a traveling leather coat drop from Always Vigilant in the Ash Heap of all places), but there are specific places where specific outfits have better spawn rates. The forest and urban scout armor masks drop from Uranium Fever. The forest jumpsuit drops in the Forest. The BOS items drop in the Cranberry Bog. Leather and Traveling Leather Coats drop in the mire. The Responders Fireman outfit and helmet drop in the Toxic Valley. Lastly, the Asylum Uniforms spawn on the third floor of Fort Defiance, in the shower area and the sleeping quarters.
---
Then people would want it in the base though not just on the ground. My camp is mostly floating so I would want it on my top floor
---
People abused it to break their camps
---
I very much don't care about it
---
Yeah that makes sense
---
 Found it twice on NPC vendors. Bought it both times and sold one for a decent profit
---
Why is bethesda so incompetent at everything they do?
---
Winter jacket and jeans and either a DE Minigun / tse Minigun one or ther other
---
Against the queen I have my trusty b2525 fixer so I am ok, I am.using both atm
---
How do you buy levels with atoms ?
---
many instanced areas involve choices that affect the story- or at least dialogue- of the quests. since only one person can make those choices, only one person can actually complete the quest.
---
I would be happy with max one star pa parts with different effects from regular armor.
---
It takes me forever just to level up normally and I don‚Äôt even bother with the NW challenges..
---
I've got one that's BE90% that I bought out of someone's vendor for 2500 just to try it. It's a solid weapon, and I wouldn't let it go for under 10,000.
---
405 hours and found it on a scavenger trader in the ash pile if that helps you.
---
I wish search claws and or super behemoths would roam in packs make the wasteland even scarier.
---
Nothing like spawning right on top of a trap
---
so if all my friends are doing the same quest, how can we make sure it completes it for everyone
---
I don't think there is a good answer as I think there are at least 3 things going on, a nuke timer, an area reset timer and other things depending on where it is.
---
I try to not to do anything that could possibly get me banned as I enjoy this game to much.
---
so we all have to do individually
---
The true benefit of the game is playing with friends. The legendary run is just something to do thats fun and different. If you buy the entire thing then you take away from getting things as you go with friends. This is not a single player game
---
it doesn't, if he knew this fact and decided to grind out legit for that feeling, good for him, was just saying that if he didnt already know he could've had it any day he wanted
---
Just interested - how does the cosmetics only argument fail?
---
yes. either solo the instanced parts, or be willing to do it multiple times and alternate the team leader position.
---
Its essentially the same outfit but colored differently.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Happened to me as well. Very frustrating
---
How can it be done? I'm waiting towards the end anyway.
---
I think this is the same mentality as the flying autoaim cheaters in NW. They think they achived something... and they think they are on the same page with legit players.
---
You would need to add me on game's own social interface even if you were on Steam so you can add people even if they're on a different platform. 
---
Starched Genes is a Luck perk.
---
i just don‚Äôt do the NW challenge if it‚Äôs leveling up. Or kill NINE creatures (the fuck). Or any other shit ones. I‚Äôd rather do the repeatable weekly 2.5 times more per day to make up for it. Fuck those challenges.
---
In that case i wouldn't use demolition expert at all
---
Yep, that's how I almost initiated PvP. The server I was in bugged out and wasn't showing any of the workshop icons, so I went over to the abandoned bog town thinking, "surely no one has claimed this." Got tired of searching for the workbench and just held down MMB and clicked "yes," and then all of a sudden it's giving me popups about the owner coming to defend it. Noped right the fuck out hoping the owner wouldn't come after me.
---
Nothing in the season rewards interest me. The grind doesn't turn me off, breaking adrenaline turned me off . I've played far too many hours in fallout 76 anyway. It was time for a break, I'll be back in a diminished capacity after it is fixed.
---
At least double the 150 to 300 scrip a day would make a huge difference in stash management, especially given that there are so many people crafting Secret Service Armors, you hit a wall fast with that and what you can legitimately carry around or stash before you have to just [throw it on the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ) - which is what I've been doing with my SS crafts that I'm disgusted by, I'm looking at you Nocturnal SS Left Leg - happy birthday to the ground.
---
repair kits and scrap kits are a waste of money. never buy either. just collect scrap to repair stuff, and scrap and stash your junk at every opprotunity.
---
Yup, I've spent 15 minutes wandering around looking for people.  Battle Royale is a boring and stupid game mode to begin with but NW takes it to extremes.  Map is far too big, SPECIAL depending on adventure mode is stupid, luck for weapons and ammo is too great.  Truly awful.  It reminds me of 1990s games where getting more than 8 people on a server was a technical achievement and people ignored how awful the actual game play was.
---
The real cautionary tale is it doesn‚Äôt sound like you are aware that you can repair gear at workbenches and don‚Äôt need to buy or obtain repair kits.
---
Weapons workbenches for weapons, armor workbenches for armor
---
Wow so the exactly same thing happened to me today as well. On loading in to adventure mode my game crashed so I reloaded in and picked adventure again, when I loaded it I had 7/9 dailys complete just the NW challenge and eat gum which was 1/3 complete.
---
Edit. I submitted a support ticket and all they said is they are working on a fix, they don‚Äôt do anything so save yourself the trouble.
---
Would be nice. To avoid the traps, make it where traps cannot harm players.
---
is there a list of instances sections?
---
I'm pretty sure the double score weekend ends on Monday, so the dailies will go back to being 250, except level up which is 1K currently/500 normally if I remember correctly.
---
lol you have all my sympathies.
---
I joined a team the other day with high level players and was really excited to see that they all had dozens or hundreds of plans for sale, because despite the fact that I've been playing since BETA, there is still a ton that I don't have.
---
Imagine my disappointment as I went from camp to camp only to find that they all were selling all of their plans way over MSRP. Place that the game would suggest sell at 200, they were all charging 500, 1000, 5000 caps. A couple of them emoted confusion as me as I left their camp without buying anything.
---
Or Brain bombs (radiated sugar bombs, brain fungus, Mothman eggs and purified water) instead brain fungus soup
---
And last, hopefully.
---
Only time I leave or boot someone is if they are sharing perks that mess with my rads.
---
I guess I've totally mistaken this post with another with a guy asking about to legendary shotguns lol
---
This is great!
---
they usually tell you before you enter one. if you're part of a team but not the leader, you're given the option of either entering solo seperate from the team leader to do it on your own, or joining the team leader's instance to help them, with each option being a different button prompt.
---
edit: on second thought, this may only apply to public teams. i do not know of any list but i would assume anytime you do something not on the overworld (like entering a building), it's instanced.
---
you're taking this way too seriously. I was telling him that this outfit is the easiest thing to get. and also, you don't have to pay and download, and risk getting banned. so it's not quite a similar comparison :/ and I said that if he just wanted to grind then good for him
---
You gotta wait long enough
---
I try to do them a little but most of the stuff doesn't fit my camp or character build. I'm honestly underwhelmed with the rewards tbh.
---
Part of my problem is I played the heck out of the game after Wastelanders. Got max rank with settlers and raiders and also bought most everything I wanted with bullion.
---
It's not enough to get me to login and play. If the run came with new content I'd likely play more often.
---
Looks like the fx of fireworks in the Dead Money dlcs &gt;.&gt;
---
Concur... you spawn kinda north of your C.A.M.P., no matter what orientation you turn the machine.  So just move it around your build area until you like where you spawn in on.
---
I have never had someone use my card. On Xbox at least for me I can't use anyone else's card either
---
Oh I thought they were being nice and increased it for the 2nd part of the pass..
---
I think it should be 300 daily limit. I can understand limits on the scrip just like the gold, but a higher amount would be helpful. Especially for those who cannot play everyday or for very long. That would reduce a lot of the grind and be rewarding for both types of players (those who play longer hours and those who do not). Could also add a vendor like the one who sells gold to the player once a week sell scrip for caps.
---
I'll add you too,what time do you play?
---
Very helpful, thanks! 
---
I haven‚Äôt played with anyone yet, going it alone. 
---
Are the events worth the time and effort? I‚Äôm super low on ammo at the mo and don‚Äôt want to burn though it picking off mole rats for minimal rewards.
---
Ok.  
---
I know I'm not going to hit 100 and not going to spend money to get there. I know all of the rewards and will shoot for the furthest one and then use Atoms to get it if I'm not there later on.
---
Or embedded in a mountain! LOL
---
The fake sheepsquatch explodes right when people runs to loot it
---
everything? all asylums uniforms? tattered field jacket? leather coat? travlling leather coat? all region jumpsuits? all 3 firemen sets? pirate set? both halloween sets? all 4 variants of the hazmat suit? 
---
m8, very impressive for a level 130! 
---
congrats
---
In my world a few is four maybe five. But my original comment I said " a couple of weeks". I was incorrect.
---
lol thats right when I go to loot it.. because everyone else runs away...
---
No, I‚Äôm good thanks, going it alone at the mo.
---
I‚Äôm going for a all rounded at the moment, I have minimal perk cards!
---
I leveled up to 15 from getting my first solo win, without firing a single shot and with only a tiny sliver of health(after having to run from jackbooted thugs out for my blood. Well, they all died in hellfire and I lived!)
---
Hiding in a bush the whole time and people watching your would-be murderers run around is so much fun. I actually like NW now.
---
Also rn my name is datoneboi9769,I didn't realise it was taken so it automatically put numbers,and I'ma change it again,so it's either gonna be datoneboi9769 or ressinec,because ressinec is what I'm gonna change it to later
---
If you're not the team leader, every time a door has two keys to enter the interior is instanced. One lets you enter as part of the leader's instance, the other as your own. The leader always has only one choice, which is his own instance.
---
I'm sorry I should've made myself more clear everything I want. I have some asylums hats pink though yellow, and you can only get the glowing skeleton from NW event in 2019 but I do have the base one.
---
I like them. They're free so eh.
---
So I'll add you and I'll be either called datoneboi9769 or ressinec
---
If you don' t loot the bastard quick enough It occasionally disappears
---
I just wanted the sink
---
It pulses slightly, indeed useless, but can be used to nice effect, I put it in a completely dark room, with the stars wallpaper and the faces of fasnacht floor tile, it looks cool there, I guess if you had a really dark wooded area, it might be interesting.
---
hope you find whats missing for you, m8! :)
---
The Legendary Run leaves me indifferent. I don't go out of my way to progress on it at all. I just play the game as I please and if I happen to unlock a reward, great. I have reached rank 50 without caring about it and will continue to do so in the future.
---
You can run all over near top of the world and get the ski poles. It's a great little loot run as there are tons of plans laying around the area too.
---
Nice. Gonna start doing this myself. Thanks
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Yeah I have had it Happen twice but I‚Äôm not letting my loot go. So I waited and like the one person said if you wait ten minutes sometimes longer sometimes shorter you can respawn and get your loot
---
I had my most exciting and fun match last night. I beat the odds and won(my first solo win and second overall win) without firing a single shot, after losing 90% of my health from being shot at by my opponents and having to run away and hide, and getting the satisfaction of having them all die to hellish fire while I lived on.
---
I think nuclear winter scores need to be 
---
Do such and such in NW or do this other challenge.
---
honestly, we just need the ability to change the level of our gear. 
---
it should be very expensive though.
---
1,000 for Scrip
---
5,000 for Gold
---
2,000 (currently) for Ammo Converter credits
---
30,000 for Caps
---
Yeah I had this happen to me once, I had all the pylons activated and when the imposter was dead I jumped off the roof and must of landed in a bunch of eyebots or something because I died instantly.  I was pissed I couldn‚Äôt respawn after using all of those stimpaks.
---
"Just atoms" A hell of a lot more atoms by the way than we can get now and with those we got to CHOOSE things we wanted. They took away choice and dumped a bunch of Atom Store reject skins onto this updated challenge system while GUTTING the amount of atoms we can earn in-game. That's the complaint.
---
Anyone can collect with a few diluted radX/radaway and Chinese Stealth armor/PA. Don‚Äôt wait for others if you want the event rewards and not just looting ghouls.
---
I've got so far to go, but I dutifully go to the park every day and get my 3 tokens.
---
Awesome, I'll take look there.  Thanks friend!
---
They need more stuff that is low maintenance and allows players to create their own fun. 
---
Stuff like multiple camp modules, refrigerated vending machines, faction themed public teams, etc, etc.
---
Large content drops get ran through quickly and then players are left with nothing to do.
---
Edit: they need community events around factuons. Like joining a Responder public team and killing mobs or donating resources allows Flatwoods to be upgraded. Or just challenges that award commendations which you then use to buy cosmetic and camp objects with a faction theme. Just like the Ever Upwards quests.
---
Especially when there's a challenge to claim a workshop or several, I have started presuming that, especially if no work has been done to build up the place (though keep in mind that some of us will claim a workshop so we have room to build stuff when there's also a challenge asking us to build things in workshops or our CAMP), no one is feeling protective of their workshop.  I will start the claim and then run to a far-off corner of the green-edged boundary (away from the fast-travel spawn) and hide until the workshop is claimed.
---
I had thought about making a sign, but I'm excited to see someone else actually do it!  Brilliant!
---
it really only impacted people who glitched their camp budget and the vendors were easily accessed from the spawn in point when traveled too.
---
I continued to use my vendors the entire time and had no issues.
---
At this point I really only want one more thing. Unfortunately the thing I want is like... the reward for 98th or 99th level. So I've been using the double SCORE week to try an get caught up, not sure if 45 is on track at this point though. I hope there's at least 1 more double score week.
---
1
---
I got the Raider Hanging Tree thing recently which I really like.    
---
I'm not a PA user yet despite having almost a full set in storage. I'm not a fan of cosmetic items b/c they don't benefit the character. I don't get my rocks off having some crazy awesome camp like "some people".    
---
IMO the best rewards are: Perk Card Packs. Legendary Script of course. Gold Bullion but I just finished that questline 2 nights ago and don't know much about the stuff offered or how it works.    
---
Vault-tec Supply packages. Caps, Lunchboxes. Atoms. I like the Guille paint for gear and weapons. Making them for a specific weapon or armor type/level is ridiculous. I'm sure someone at BGS could come up with better more unique rewards. IMO for each section you could get a 1 Star Legendary of your choosing from a menu: Handgun, Rifle, Melee (1hd, 2hd), etc. and could also choose gear. Next section would be a 2 star and then 3 start. When you claim it, you get an item that when used opens a menu and you can specifically choose the aspects of it. Type of armor. Type of weapon and he effects on that gear and depending on what level. It would also have the longest durability and degrade VERY slowly even without the required perk.    
---
The Fixer issue needs to be fixed. It doesn't look unique in anyway. I keep a Glow sight on it and a medium on another Combat Rifle to tell them apart.
---
People are currently using SBs/CHSS so as not to be cheaply auotaimed and mowed down sub second by Railroads. 
---
Personally, I don't think it's even possible to have a level playing field with all the quantums, teslas, legacies, gammas, sentasses, chss, SBs, vats, hacked items... It is just what it is, buggy mess, if enjoyable in its own niche way.
---
Who cares, it's not like there's anything interesting on the legendary run anyway.
---
Was fixed awhile ago. You're still susceptible if you glitched your camp budget beyond max... But other than that your safe.
---
The fun on duping/glitching/cheating is always short lived and mediocre, no thanks
---
As a tip for whoever might have problems with the event, a simpler way to survive or simply if one does not have access to Troubleshooter armor and mains an Energy weapon, with the Stealth Suit keeping you in [Hidden] (getting as far away as possible from the fight area so that Healing Factor kicks in) and moderate stim spamming it's possible to take all three pylons without too much problem.
---
Of course most of the times one has to give up on tagging the Imposter, but honestly a random legendary object that's going to be trash 99.99% of the time is not worth the chance of failing the event. Fixer plans and Imposter outfit are way more valuable, imo.
---
Preach brother!!
---
How many levels in NW do you have to get to level from 2 to 3 in adventure?
---
I found a solution to this; Bring up the team menu, choose one of your teammates, and pick "Respawn here".
---
If you're not on a public team, you should be able to just join a random one, and respawn at one of the players.
---
Sure they can't just like they couldn't give players items back when people were getting things stolen
---
I'm just bummed you can't get enough ore without help.
---
Im pretty sure I‚Äôve seen them having announced that they fixed it. I‚Äôve just started playing the game a week ago and I haven‚Äôt come across any way that that‚Äôs possible and/or that someone had taken Stuff from me
---
Many more players are playing because of Gamepass, and no, I'll voice my frustrations if I want to. This game deserves every bit of criticism it receives
---
I‚Äôve been writing ‚ÄúCLAIM ME‚Äù in glowing letters on all the workshops I‚Äôve been taking. It only occurred to me yesterday that having blueprints for defense platforms and workshops might make it easier. So I‚Äôll make on of these too!
---
Thanks for the idea
---
They are useless to the people who pump their hard earned cash in to the game via fallout 1st or purchasing atoms but they are great for the people who don't
---
I do agree with this. Level up Over Seer should be a weekly event. The other challenges like  kill a player or deploy camp are fine as dailies. The only time level up Overseer should be a daily is if it is a double exp event. Because then leveling is pretty easy to do.
---
We used to get many more atoms from doing daily challenges to buy items we want
---
If it makes you feel any better I'm old too with the same problem, especially when it comes to work.  
---
"Remember that robot we installed 10 months back?"
---
"Um, that was literally three and a half years ago". Lol.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just kill them!
---
Break their legs, and make them watch!‚Äù
---
They auto lock any and all tickets mentioning it so its impossible to get in contact with a person.
---
The raider power armor makes it look so much cooler. Nice pic!
---
‚ÄúWas just saying that his grind was literally pointless and the fuckwit coulda just had his mates dupe it for him like everyone else‚Äù
---
literally what you sound like. some people like playing legitimately and the fact that you even mentioned duping as a response makes you look like a douche
---
here for this
---
LMAO. Too cute. As a girl I would wear it, as I enjoy rocking my pink power armor and bear costume when not in PA. 
---
The big question is...can you walk up to someone wearing it and milk their udders. 
---
Now that would be hilarious and something worth using your ProSnap camera on.
---
Those muthaf%&amp;@ers.. you dont mess with a mans Brahmen
---
Ive had several awesome moments with the community.  Hard to say which one is the best.  Yesterday was probably my most fun day in 76 for only playing the game for 2 weeks.  My team leader took me to several events back to back.  And once we killed the legendary enemy he would signal me to come over and he would drop the item his leg. Item for me.  He then sent me a message saying to trade them for scrip and get a 3 star weapon. Of course I have already done this a couple of times.  He then lead me to a location, dropped several hundred rounds of random ammo, waved and left the game.  Later on I got onto a team and we did Scorched Earth 3 times in a row.  It was so much fun!  Of course me and my little gatling gun didn‚Äôt do much in the way of helping but I was in there giving it my all lol.
---
I like these ready structures like the Red Rocket garage. They are really good when you got alts and keep moving camps. Not interested in pure cosmetics though.
---
They removed those now though, and added new ones like Collect a Bobblehead. I dunno, feels like they breathe some life into the servers, like people claiming workshops and building floor decor, sharing Bobblehead finder perks and jumping camps to buy 3x ammo lol
---
Yes. Only once I believe. 
---
Similar to the farmhouse sink that was released for 3 days last December and then again for a few days a couple of months later.
---
I am aware of that, but those quests were too difficult. They required a lot of stuff, instead now they are accessible to everyone and I don't have to play an entire day to accomplish them. I can agree that the cosmetics in this pass are not that good, but it's the first try, maybe the next one will be better.
---
Hero. I dont usually interact with folks and have wanted to ask of it's cool that I take their shop for my daily and never do. I think you started a trend.
---
That's some amazing ice cream last time I had it
---
So there's 2 spwan points for a camp. One when you're close by and the camp doesn't have to load and one when your far away and it has to load (tested it a bunch of times at a few camps and I rebuild every week usually). All you have to do is see where you spawn at compared to where your camp module is at. You will spawn at that distance and angle from the module (remember there are 2 different spots though) then just move the module to try to get a better spawn point. However, turning the module doesn't change the angle, you will always spawn at the original angle and distance away from the module.
---
You love French Toast and also the color blue.
---
I strangely have never had an issue with wendigos, and havnt had issues with mirelurk kings since getting geared, but some mobs still manage to give me a start every so often. 
---
Like the one time I was picking razorgrain and all of a sudden a maw full of teeth bit me in the face really made me jump. Turns out it was a super mutant hound hiding in the grass.
---
Or the 1 time I was picking wood in the mountains and it was getting dark, I ran into a super mutant and quickly dispatched him, then saw the silhouette of another a short ways off. I go to dispatch him the same way and all of a sudden the bastich ran at me at 600 miles per hour!
---
Royally freaked me out, turns out it was a charred feral ghoul.   XD
---
Their about the same shape in the dark, I was all like that's impossible! Super mutants can't run that fast!   .o  ,
---
damn smart
---
my friends didnt dupe, some people literally just drop them for you. the grind was a journey for him and hmif that's what he wanted then yeah good for him. and I was just saying, he spent months on this and i was just telling him, not advocating for it, I was even nice about it so if that's how you want to read my comment then idc you mean nothing to me lmao
---
I'm getting flashbacks to Season 4 of Modern Warfare where everyone was complaining about having to play Warzone for the officer challenges. Why are you upset they want you to play a part of the game? And even then the math wizards had confirmed even before the daily challenges went from 7 to 9 you can get to 100 without playing NW. The guy who made the sarcastic post about killing legendary enemies p much summed up this nonsense.
---
How many days in do we need to get for people to stop posting this stuff?? There‚Äôs one NW daily challenge. ONE. What about the folks (like me) who love the mode and play it more than adventure? Stop complaining.
---
I agree. Others in the world have planted and grown stuff like silt beans. We‚Äôre supposed to be smart and intelligent.
---
Bought mine for 8k caps.
---
Depends on if you owned it or not. 
---
You can place wallpaper you don‚Äôt own and it will purchase it from the atom shop. If you already had the paper then, no it should not have cost you. 
---
Sounds like you might have used paper you didn‚Äôt have yet.
---
They‚Äôre fine y‚Äôall can‚Äôt appreciate nothing, it‚Äôs something to do in the background.
---
That's why I carry a junkies gamma gun. It melts almost everyone lol.
---
One time before player vending a kid tried to sell me 10mm ammo for 20 caps a bullet
---
Yeah I can agree with ya. And personally it's not really that I want them to fix it even though that's what I said. I just want to know if they're aware of it and plan on disabling vats for pvp or whatever. The hacked items is a pc prob tho. Were safe from hackers on console so far. Nuclear winter is where I go for my somewhat fair pvp and unlike others, I actually like NW.
---
Nothing in a game is ever mandatory, you can play it any way that you want to play it.  I do everything in excavator PA all the time because my carry weight is so high all the time that if I don‚Äôt I am slowed down to a crawl.
---
And the halloween atom shop items!!!  Rilly don't wanna wait till October to incorporate those into my camp  .o  ,
---
Cute!
---
and the fact you're against legacies tells me everything I need to know.
---
When this happens I usually choose to respawn at Abandoned mine site Kittery (west from the Pylon ambush site) and fast travel back to the event. This will make you respawn properly without the need to close the game but you will not recieve any reward if event ends vile you are at Abandoned mine site Kittery so fast travel back as quick as possible.
---
It's pretty obvious: more cosmetics
---
Finding flat dirt ground is really difficult
---
just politely telling him that all of his grinding was a meaningless effort bc everyone else got this outfit by cheating or having friends that cheat
---
I have a system where my caps reset ten hours before my scrip... This way I can vendor excess legendaries... Then later on I can scrip the new ones. If Bethesda ever wanted to up the daily limits I won't complain, but the trick is working the system to keep your stash rotating as much as possible. It won't get you your stuff any sooner, but it will allow to continue on the XP and other uncapped grinds unencumbered.
---
You could get some atoms to buy stuff you want instead of grinding for the less than mediocre and sometimes plainly broken stuff they put in the legendary run. That's why do many hate it.
---
Okay, thanks for clearing that up. I don't really need to unlock the jacket, personally, though, as I bought enough of them from player vendors ages ago. That that was possible was another bug, I'm aware of that. ;-)
---
Thunderpipe ammo drum does indeed block the front sight... so hope you're good with hip fire
---
Screaming Eagle skin even says 7.62MM NATO (.308) on the side of the reciever, that would've made this  an AR-10. This will never sit well with me and Bethesda, they nerfed a  weapon based on percieved press optics, you telling me in all of Apalachia there aren't any surviving AR-15's ?? .308 should've been a superior cartridge over the 5.56mm oh and the drum mag is only a 30 rounder, that's a blantant control point, WTF? ( like theres any point to compliance with the agenda in a post apocalyptic game thats all about murdering everything else so you live.) It looks like a 10 round on the screaming  eagle skin. At least the communist rifle skin has the drum depicted. That would've been 7.62x39mm so, it's all wrong too. 
---
The Dark Matter skin is for the Combat rifle, not the Fixer. Fixer is a skin... FDE (flat dark earth) color.  I have a legendary 3-star Anti-Armor Fixer.
---
someone with a civil reply? no way. I understand that and I completely agree.
---
I‚Äôd assume anything with the atomic shop logo on it is shared, right?
---
My favorite are the Mr. Gutsies who say "Stay frosty".
---
Congrats bro! 6 months is a big milestone. Video games have been big for me staying sober too, fo76 has been perfect for my sanity during quarantine. 14 months coming up soon
---
Do you have the new camp skin on?
---
The new camp modul skin do this. It is bugged.
---
I don't want more pay-to-win items. What are on about?
---
They call it " The left-hand of Darkness " for a reason
---
just turn on passive.
---
Someone complained about this yesterday as well, must be a fun new bug
---
I never use the front sight on mine. I put the gunner sight on it and all you can see are crosshairs not what you're shooting at. I just Hipfire.
---
Yeah. Definitely a downside.
---
Sorry I meant it‚Äôs easier to level up in adventure mode with a low level toon..
---
I usually only boot people if I have someone I know on the same server or if the person is basically not doing anything also those who share perks that makes me lose rads. That is just annoying. lol.
---
Yes, as one person said as well, you can buy the assaultron recall card for around 2k depending on your charisma and whether or not you have hard bargain. It's sold at pretty much every robot vendor. You can then use it to summon the imposter sheepsquatch at the event location to trigger the event. This can be done as many times as you want (or can afford.)
---
You wouldn‚Äôt need to whole weekend to do it. Probably a couple hours if you‚Äôre just focusing on dailies and weeklies. You could also cover most of them by just playing the game casually and looking out for the objectives as you play
---
I will be right back.... I have to google stuff... for science...
---
Better yet give me a search feature so I can I be oh this guy has the thing I want let me buy that directly from him.
---
No NW challenges ever gave atoms, only NW perk packs. And honestly I wish they didn't remove the daily perk packs, 50 free XP is always good.
---
We got more atoms to purchase items we actually want. Now we're at the mercy of Bethesda who have given us mostly garbage as I've noted.
---
Some ghoulish love going on there. Bet the ghoul is thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be with you even if you become a bloated glowing one after eating those spoiled hot dogs at the park‚Äù.
---
They are trying to protect the precious supply of toilet paper inside the porta-potties.
---
Be nice if we had power armor displays.
---
That is what I have been doing myself.
---
Fast travel to Watoga and discover all the locations. 
---
However, it may be even easier to hit level 2 of NW and have the adventure mode xp level you up, if it counts
---
I'm stealing this, try and stop me.
---
More camp items, skins, outfits.
---
I hate this challenge, everything during this challenge just fucks me over and I'm level 27.. I literally leveled up *the day before* so I used an alt, cba spending 3 hours to level up and be constantly fucked over 
---
Any other challenge? Piss easy ones like the CAMP or creatures? Enjoyable playing NW, level up? Na, you can be happy with getting 5xp per match cause fuck me I guess
---
I bloody love this
---
Hey, I will be running Encrypted a few times today when I get on, around 2 hours from now. Feel free to join the small discord I'm apart of. There are people who trade, build, and event run. https://discord.gg/nc2AfV
---
Same issue I have with the daily challenge which forces you to do the one daily quest that can only be done once - mistaken identity. You can do the mini quests that are a part of it as much as you want, but not the quest itself.
---
The thing is there is literally nothing else to do in game
---
I think there is a good chance the clean version would come as a earnable costume rather than atom shop because it's already been obtained by hackers.
---
honestly i have no idea. They make public teams for events or hunting and do absolutely nothing but regular quests
---
Aight, thanks mate!
---
I do this while I‚Äôm working, it‚Äôs a good pastime.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a hacker in nw since the ban wave. I could just be lucky.
---
have u finished the vault 79 raid?
---
wish the shitstains like you would have stayed banned, community was better off without people that duped legacies. Bethesda felt the pain of their bottom line tho so all the scum is back. Hurray.
---
It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake you want to do it‚Äù any more than the daily challenges did. It‚Äôs your choice, you can choose whether or not you do it
---
yes
---
Well, that's true but not for everyone, I am a casual player and I never did the old daily quests, and if I did, it was not voluntary. Now I can get more for doing the same. For me is a win but I can understand your point of view.
---
For a display, I also want a single item display, like a taller marble column, where I can make it a central focus. Like, the standard twelve bears go in normal cases, but Bear #12 gets a special spotlight because he's the one people forget about. Or the usual Nuka Colas get a normal display, but Nuka My Blood's In It gets the spotlight column.
---
But we need that dang single.
---
Someone already made this post
---
Exactly. So have I. This is a old wives tale like throwing explosive bait to make the Queen land. You wouldn't believe how many idiots swore by it at one time.
---
They'll never stop complaining
---
Twin lakes?
---
The clean ranger hat has a guaranteed spawn in a portapotty somewhere in the top left area of the map, I don‚Äôt remember exactly where though
---
This. We need this. Give us back.
---
I'm addition to this if you see someone else down one you can still loot it even if you didn't shoot it.
---
I wasn't ever banned :/ I have never been banned and I have never duped :/ so I dont know what your problem is
---
Most agree with me.
---
I'm Rank 80, I think.  I work on it because it's "something to do," but you would hear no objection from me if this was the first and last season of theirs.  The game just doesn't have the content to support it, and it's honestly astonishing how half-assed and broken several of the rewards are.  There aren't even that many, but a good third have *something* wrong with them.
---
That, and for having such a stringent timeline that they expect players to grapple with, they sure drag their feet when it comes to fixing the problems they created.  Auto-completing challenges, still not fixed.  Lunchboxes rolling XP boosts back to 0%?  "Planned for a future patch" (not even saying it will be Patch 21).  Being unable to retroactively aware SCORE to players wronged by these errors?  Not happening.
---
Chinese stealth armor and put diluted radaway on your favorites wheel
---
Well it is still in BETA lol
---
HA! It's a simple case of someone keeps the vendor there by just standing there while you swap to a different character to check the inventory. I had it there for 3 hours at my camp and me and some random guy took turns swapping characters.
---
All that - plus I can't stand the obnoxiously low Camp Budget. I feel like I have to build a bare bones camp - basic small box with crafting stations - if I want to also have crops and water. It feels incredibly restrictive.
---
Want so bad to be able to direct people to spawn in a specific place in my camp. If they spawned at my front door it would be perfect instead of the middle or worse back of my camp.
---
My camp is this crazy silent hill experienc where you enter a small clinic house and on the second floor is an ominous sealed room, entering it sets up sirens as u traverse through a blackened smokey hallway. Past the hall ur walking over broken chain link fences that go downward 5 stories leading to an eerie arcane pit. Past that your awarded with my vendor room and some great prices.
---
But because people spawn in the middle between the 2 main structures they get lost or just run through the walls and give up entirely trying to find the right way in or try to cheat it even.
---
Sadly my camp faces south and  o matter what I tried it always spawns them too deep into the camp. 
---
At least give the camp device a front and back side and let us rotate it to determine the direction they spawn in.  .o  ,
---
For the legendary system coming
---
?
---
I‚Äôm not against PvP it‚Äôs fun  just don‚Äôt touch my camp because it very easy to destroy and it takes shitload of materials to repair
---
My first cabin. I set up in the trees next to the farm on the south side of Morgantown. The sounds of the wind chimes, the trees blowing, and the radio in the background. No generator yet, no turrets, no overworld music. I would actually sit in a chair on my porch for a while and just Zen out to the sound while I browsed reddit on my phone.
---
I take it you mean on another server? As the silo has a 3 hour cool down. I'm confused.
---
NW of Huntersville. SW of of Emmett mountain. 
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Twin\_Lakes?file=Twin\_Lakes\_map.png](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Twin_Lakes?file=Twin_Lakes_map.png)
---
That's the first good weapon I had as well!
---
Mine was level 1, but I used it well into level 80. It was good early and late game. 
---
Did you recieve it from another player? I passed mine down to anoter player as I got a better lever-action rifle.
---
They increased the amount of dailies, but Double Score Weekend is a limited time event
---
What I meant was Bethesda balancing the game around legendary power armor. Making boss fights and tougher content with PA being the baseline
---
For some of us, Radiation Rumble is like Line in the Sand, just a place to farm XP from waves of enemies. Were it not for The Legendary Run I'd do neither of them. In fact, the first time I did either event was after the Legendary Run went live. These events are just filler to waste time between content releases like Wastelanders and Fractured Steel. Colossal Problem will be the same.
---
Bash
---
But most endgame players have already got a ton of them waiting to have them as rewards is weak
---
I have no problems with Wendigos and Mirelurk Kings, but Floaters scare the hell out of me. I really don't like these guys.
---
Ew. üòÇ
---
Would say bring back welcome mat functionality but make it so that trap type items cant be within 1 rooms worth of space from it. That way players have a decent chance to use their wits to avoid any traps. 
---
People too need to remember to always wait a minute for the camp to finish spawning,  otherwise u wind up stuck in the foundation/walls or walking off a cliff that would have been secure rooms otherwise.
---
I'm afraid fixing pvp is very much at the bottom of priorities list and all the bugs or weird mechanics (like borked group pvp at workshops atm) that get slowly introduced are just left to rot, since maybe only some single digit % of player population is really into it.  
---
Also playing NW on PCs is basically a masochistic experience. Just boggles my mind how could have devs left it in such sorry state. When I launch Warzone or any modern BR I feel like there's a decade or more of a difference...
---
ok - quest must just be bugged right now due to the recent changes.  I'll submit a bug report and try again in a week or so.
---
Yeah, lol. They fixed that too. 
---
Disappointment all around for the people who were grinding like crazy to unlock those rewards when they were a "limited time" unlock.  First you had people running vending machines full of those outfits, and then the rewards come back later and are available to unlock for like 2 months straight.   Think originally people had two weeks to unlock it and were grinding like crazy LOL.
---
Another trick to complete the event without even using a weapon is to place 6 power armor frames to block the two corridors going to the main room. Ghouls cannot cross them and they leave your workers alone.
---
I didnt know friends could place blue printed items in your camp. I thought that didnt work
---
I use a +25fr Double-Shot Gatling Laser which shreds the Sheepsquatch as well, but only with the appropriate perks.
---
76 features destruction, when a scorchbeast attack your camp it gets completly destroyed, they have tried destructible environnement in other places than camps go to philippi battlefield cemetary you can destroy the graves, or when you're lauching a nuke you can destroy the command console, i dont know if there are other places like this in the game but seems like they tried to implement it and give up cause of no time or something else.
---
&gt;if FO76 implemented the system above this sub would be losing their minds.
---
probably because the Fallout playerbase isn't the DOTA playerbase. I'd rather pay up front if they dropped the mobile-esque monetization BS. Fo4 didn't have any and it worked out just fine.
---
Another update. I've been able to do all of the perk loadout you suggested except for Better Criticals and Critical Savvy just because I don't have those cards at all. I can definitely take out enemies a lot more quickly than I used to thanks to your help. I just need to figure out an alternate build for when it comes to taking on enemies like the Scorchbeast Queen. My rifles just don't seem to do too much to her. But, I'm loving entering an area and just oneshotting regular scorched in the head.
---
That's what my wife calls my morning wood.
---
That‚Äôs two ‚Äúfirst off‚Äôs,‚Äù Karen.
---
Bethesda: haha. Nahh
---
Well that‚Äôs just not true. I think it‚Äôs clear more people feel like they need to grind every challenge right now than they did with previous challenges. 
---
Under the old challenge system there was not as much urgency, you could always earn more atoms later.
---
FO4 did not require servers and did not add free content.
---
Yeah so its a magical shotgun. It does much more damage than its supposed to do. Any shotgun with bash damage, 33% vats and 50% limb damage is seen as a magical shotgun
---
Which usually is north from the module, tho camp structures could shift that about as the game tries to find the nearest solid surface to spawn them in on.
---
At my camp people actually spawn slightly south of my module due to it being on a 5bstory building.  But I cat get them to spawn at the very front of my camp for the life of me.
---
Also my camp is built on a random assault trigger point, and if an event is spawned in when a player is loading it will further adjust their initial placement.
---
I had to set up a path of lanterns to try and signal players the correct direction to go in to find the entrance,  its like 30% effective.
---
They're just showcasing the Fly Swatter event.
---
What you don't get is that there are people who like to play NW. In their eyes, they only get 1 challenge and you get 6-9. The run is not designed around you, or anyone. It just tries to cover as many people as possible based on play patterns. It is not based around people who play once a week too, or people who play 30 minutes a day. I'm sick and tired of people thinking this whole thing should be absolutely tailored around their own personal playing style and life schedule. If you want to max out, you need to play on a level above casual. Get what you can and move on.
---
A friend said its caused by the new CAMP object skin... anyone else can verify?  Disabled it but still no luck.  
---
Edit:  Yep that was the cause had to disable it then replace the camp completely... SMH
---
Man I feel bad for ya. I heard it's bad but I wasnt sure about how bad the hacks were.
---
Missing the point
---
Okay perfect, adding. I'm in Ireland, so that'll work :)
---
How does a legit player get it easy? Only way I see is to grind
---
One of the Whitspring bots, in the antique shop iirc.
---
My favorite part of Fallout isn‚Äôt the stories they tell, but the ideas they plant and let the player fill in the blanks.

Never knew about that one thanks
---
i read that too, but he doesn‚Äôt have it :/
---
Just find a camp that does and stick around till it finds some.
---
Nah, that's the Firebreather Outfit, everyone has one of those. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Breather_uniform
---
You'd be looking for this one. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Responder_fireman_uniform
---
yes, it did not have free content but it also did not have mobile-esque monetization bs. that's my whole point.
---
also servers are relative. a lot of people want to host their own local private servers. but of course that would ruin their monetization scheme. so yours is not exactly sound reasoning.
---
R) Rank Up, it costs 150 Atoms per.
---
While we're at it:
---
Good gosh, how come that wrapped gift box loot bag never came back?  That's like the most versatile one you've ever offered, and it's not even a specifically Christmas thing.
---
Is Dota not free to play? F76s battle pass system is neat and quite addictive, just wish they didnt cripple our ability to earn atoms, which was advertised as part of the product I initially purchased..
---
1. Rank up Raiders/Settlers and use legendary modules to get leg weapons.
---
2. Farm SBQ if you will deal enough dmg to get loot and hope for the best. Scrip legendaries and buy 3star rolls from purveyor.
---
3. Get caps, find stuff, sell stuff, and buy an upgrade from other players (vendors).
---
Wait what? How could that get you banned. That's pretty much how you get anything from a vender. It resets when you log in so get a friend to hold the vender and you log out then back in.
---
It just works.
---
He moves once per day, he started about 70 spaces from the end, so he is essentially a daily count down to the end. If you look at his power meter (something like that, it's at the bottom of the board) it will slowly fill throughout the day and reset at daily reset time when he moves
---
For me its north about 10 foundations and east 2-3 foundations lol. My current base was built on the side of a lake with a really wide open area and somewhat flat ground so this time around I just built around the spawn point instead of trying to change it which worked out pretty well.
---
You get extra 3 star weapon if raid with raiders, plasma rifle with anti armor and 90% reduced weight
---
How is this a Karen moment?  Learn to meme
---
Maaaaaan, spent all day looking for a pet for my latest camp build, found a stunted yao gai, dam thing literally couldn't survive for an hour at my camp due it being on a random assault spawn point.
---
That and legendary enemies should drop items with a star rating equal to its own.  Why am I only getting a 1 star cane from a 3 star scorched beast?
---
Agreed.  I would like to see the people who are complaining try to level up a call of duty pass without playing and see how much more play-time you have to spend on that as opposed to the season pass for 76 which takes only a few minutes per day.
---
Yep, I used to get that often when joining a new server and having two combat shotguns favorited.
---
One of those has been replaced with a Gauss now so it's no longer a problem for me, but it is something Bethesda needs to fix.
---
I was bouncing around between Harpers Ferry, Sunnyside, and Pleasant Valley the other night searching for the marquee arrows and I found the rustic tables at one of those.
---
There's literally dozens of them! DOZENS!
---
You don‚Äôt even earn Treasury Notes until you complete Vault 79 and the game ‚Äúintroduces‚Äù you to gold bullion.
---
I will have to disagree with you just a bit. The stealth suit is solid for endgame. Plus the 1000 Rad resistance is awesome. I can skip through nukes zones and never have to use Radaway. With the fully maxed out Barbarian and Iron Clad perks, I am at 268 DM. Not bad for sneaking around the Wasteland. Add the Armor mod for the backpack, it puts it up to 358. (Which is what I use for SBQ fights.) The only downside is avoiding Mirelurk Queens spewing her poisoned acid crap.
---
It should be just "play one NW match"
---
Naise, I recall spawning into some lakes before getting jumped by mirelurks. The camp owner just looking down at the scene without helping.  XD
---
thank you! i will check them out!
---
I‚Äôm fine with it. I just don‚Äôt think it should be time gated for what it is. Do it in a couple weeks , get your shit and chill. The whole work on it for months to get 4 camp items and a couple skins is kinda lame
---
There is a shortcut, buy ranks with money.
---
I wasn't playing the game last October and I have still obtained a lot of them from player bases.
---
I have one too. Two shot and explosive. Decent IMO.
---
I nuked Harper‚Äôs Ferry a few nights ago and took down four 3 star super mutants in an hour with my team.  Got a call really nice 3 star bloodied legendary I‚Äôm now using.  Recommend doing all the medium to hard level events.  Usually 2 or 3 legendary enemies spawn.  You can scrip what you don‚Äôt like at the purveyor.  I‚Äôve also god rolled 2 bloodied weapons with her.   Last,  player vendors.  Look around.   I‚Äôve purchased a few 3 star legendaries that I still use.  Last,  join a public team.  I‚Äôve given and received some nice free gear from other players.
---
Were you not in a team? The several times i've crashed recently it's let me join my team again.
---
That‚Äôs funny, I rolled a bloody gauss last night and dumped it so quickly because I‚Äôm not bloodied or plan on trying it out anytime soon
---
You can do it after Lv. 50, but otherwise you're right, you don't get new Perk Cards for your level until you assign the point for it.  So, if you're Lv. 50, but have been banking your points since Lv. 40, you can't get a Lv. 45 card until you spent 5 of those points.
---
If you want to boost int use egghead (6 int) herd mentality (2 int) and join a building team (1-4 int depending on how many teammates you have). 
---
Strang in numbers to give you another 3 int of you like
---
Oh shit, forest camo's rare?
---
Oh my god yes. I can‚Äôt even begin to understand why they aren‚Äôt in the game to begin with.
---
Create a new character and level it up with in the first match. If I‚Äôm on a time limit I pick one of my other characters. If I have time I just play with main. Specially since the Christmas and Halloween rewards where still being given out. I only have the last winter outfit left
---
Energy ranged. Quad is best prefix for SBQ
---
Yeah, it was pretty disappointing when I slapped it in and saw the suppressor, I just don't think Bethesda even cares at this point.
---
While doing "riding shotgun" i found a skeleton with a leg trapped under some rubbles and with a saw in his hand
---
If you go into whitesprings too check the Raiders bot, that‚Äôs where I found the arrows so I was server hopping that one too.

500 atoms please

Both sounded plausible :P.. But this makes sense.
---
Can verify. Don‚Äôt use Future-Tec skin until patch. Well, hopefully at patch.
---
Got mine from Graham
---
I'm always looking for them but never come across those mystical loads of duped items in vendor camps every one else seems to always find.
---
Mainly tho I'm after the atoms store items, the Halloween vending machines,  the screaming scarecrow,  and the smoke machine.
---
Any one know if you can use the mothman and halloween smoke machines at the same time? Or do they share the same item slot?
---
I did see that you can use 2 mothman ones in workshops, but only one at my camp.
---
I'm with you. I had a new toon do one yesterday which just pissed me off. I hate NW so I really don't like doing the challenges...but I'm not giving Bethesda any real money to get max on the Score board either. I have no problem with the stimpack ones, or the camp ones. Or even the revive a player one if I can snag a friend quick. The kill creatures, kill a player, and level up ones suck so hard.
---
For some reason the shotgun is considered ballistic damage and not energy.
---
Well the mode still needs to encourage players to take part, I think having an XP requirement would be more likely to encourage players to try it out, sure they can hide in a bush, but just "play one match" would involve a lot of jumping off cliffs without having any opportunity to take interest at all.
---
Pretty much every Nuclear Winter challenge is significantly more time consuming than practically any other daily challenge, but this one definitely takes the cake.
---
My bad I misread, no you can't get banned from having multiple friends with you when running into the vendors. I thought what you had said involves duplicating.
---
You get 2250 per day, plus the repeatable. The last few days will be a bit much, but that doesnt include the weekloes that should propel you a couple spaces a week.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, because I‚Äôm sure you are a good and pleasant person, but this just seems like entitled crying. It should be the daily because *I* don‚Äôt want to do it, is not a valid argument.
---
Coronavirus seems to be affecting the dairy production in my area. Not sure if it‚Äôs just regional or not but it seems to be harder to find quality cream nowadays
---
Really rare.
---
Except I actually do understand it. By your own argument why do the NW people only get one daily? Why don't they just add "do this for adventure mode OR do this for nw". Because that would be too much to ask for? 
---
When all some people can muster is "dont like it dont do it or don't play it" that adds 0 value to critisim and diminishes the point entirely. 
---
I dont think it should be tailored to any specific play style. Currently it is tailored so that people who do play 30 minutes every day can get way more possible score than someone who plays 4 hours a day 3 days a week. 
---
Even though the second person plays more hours they get less possible score. 
---
All I'm reading from your argument is dont like it dont do it. Or dont like it do what you can and move on. Except I am and that adds 0 value to the criticism of the run. If you want to add criticism go ahead but that is not criticism that is complaining about people giving valid criticism. 
---
"If you want to max out you need to play on a level above casual ". 
---
Yes this is currently true. In order to beat it you essentially have to play every day and get every single challenge. Im not arguing whether or not it should be casual or not. Im saying those that do play casually should still be given a way to catch up that isn't hardcore grinding for exp.
---
If someone were to start playing the legendary run right now they'd need to log in every single day till the end of the run to complete it and maybe hit the repeatable exp multiple times a day. So not casual at all. 
---
This run is literally not casual in any sense of the word.
---
Still broken.  Supposedly will be fixed in Patch 21, and currently fixed in the PTS.
---
But it sounds like you had a fun time, the memory is as good as the picture!
---
Dang, I got it from Thirst Things First. I think I sold it to a robot vendor.
---
Get original
---
Got it, thank you sir.
---
Last night my team launched one I travel down with ten seconds left ready to roll then I get disconnected then I try joining back into with the team and twice it almost let me but first time it stayed on beginning screen with no buttons to push or anything and second time I got to the point it‚Äôs about to load me in but the screen was just black with the spinning thing on bottom right. Turned game off and tried third time but by then event was over so I missed out on everything. So annoying specially when I know the server didn‚Äôt crash it just tells me I disconnected. Which is horse shit
---
Personally I have yet to do a NW challenge yet, as I have absolutely no interest in the mode and I'm not allowing this silly thing to force me into playing things I don't want to. I understand if they want to make challenges for NW to reward people, but I think that should be more of a bonus type score for those that want to do it, rather than something you have to do to get all the season rewards.
---
Yeeeea should have come with the game to begin with  but no way would they give us a pre existing asset without cashing it out for atoms..
---
Oh crap.
---
Good rng luck mate!
---
By all means, don't stop by my level 5's general store to buy Level 50  3 stars, serums and ecclectic chotchkies
---
Same to you sir.
---
I can't recall having ever been killed by a gulper before, they do get a bit grabby tho.
---
Dont forget to aim for the face of fog crawlers and they drop real quick, their armor is pretty thick every where else.
---
I don‚Äôt get to play a huge amount and after today‚Äôs daily‚Äôs I‚Äôll be level 60. Pretty easy to reach 100 I think. Lots just like to whine and demand everything for nothing.
---
I got a unyielding ss chestpiece on my first one, but it was only 1 star. Still use it though.
---
200 would be nice since they are copy and pasting code into a pre existing asset.. I know that's not realistic though.
---
How about a FO4 building bundle "classic building bundle".
---
bright headlamp works
---
I‚Äôd ask that isn‚Äôt this obvious? But... I guess not huh? Lol. Also, when I want to get the level up daily on adventure mode I do the same thing if I‚Äôm not near a level on my two main.
---
That is very true!  I did get a good shot of us standing by one the scorchbeast corpses.
---
Easiest even in the game. Turn up. Fire one shot. Collect reward
---
If you get behind the person as they're inputting the code, once they're off the keypad you can take control of the console. It's well established.
---
I launched solo

When i die i cant press x to respawn or access the menu to fast travel I just get stuck having to Stare at my corpse
---
Not to mention if you are on pc you have the hackers/modders who instagib you while they are floating in the air from across the map. Real fun that.
---
So its an exploit thats messed up
---
Two maps in one year and 90% of the time Morgantown is the voted one. How can all these losers that are lvl 400+ continue to enjoy such repetitiveness?
---
I try to collect rare stuff, so that sucks.
---
I personally rate reload speed on heavies, reload on most of them is painful. Was using a junkies LMG with faster reload and lock and load perk - was a monster how quick it was! In terms of killing yourself with explosive weapons, if you run fireproof you'll be grand and it also makes you immune to scorchbeast scream attack. Faster fire rate is good on heavies, just don't over pull the trigger to waste ammo!
---
I am 64 and I‚Äôve done all dailies except I think 3 nw ones. Like the one where you had to revive 3 people or 2 and kill 6 creatures. But even with missing them I know very well I‚Äôll be able to reach 100 by September being were in what week 3 or 4 and I am level 64. Still got 6 weeks and if I did 60 levels in 4 weeks I most certainly should be able to do 36 in 6 weeks
---
Cripping the legs makes just about any enemy easy to avoid.
---
Land mines. Drop one or more near you. It‚Äôs often the last thing they expect and if you have more than one they sometimes move from where that one is to where the other one is. Most fun was a triple, guy set off and died then his buddy set off the third but lived.
---
granted they usually live

You‚Äôre on Reddit silly! You don‚Äôt have a wife lmao

Should be 53 by the end of today.
---
Honestly the pvp should've been a Zax "Calculation of potential future battles" that involve Enclave &amp; BoS, you'd be assigned to one team at random and it would be an attack &amp; defend map ala Unreal Tournament assault gamemode, with npcs on both sides.
---
That actually is a valid argument that I do not want to play a game mode I never have ever touched before and dont plan on playing. Especially when the legendary run rewards are mostly set to be given to adventure mode players. There is very very little if anything that NW players get from the legendary run. Except getting team mates that often dont care about the game because they're just there for dailys.  
---
Its not entitled to say I dont touch a daily or game mode I dont play because I'm not interested in it. 
---
It is valid criticism to call it extremely odd that they would give only one NW daily because that means it solely exists to make people play NW. Especially when most of them are time consuming to do. I dont mind the place any number of camps one because it can literally be done in seconds.
---
But kill 9 ai/kill 5 ai? Level up your rank? 
---
Why is it anytime someone has valid criticism on the run the only response is entitled instead of an actual argument against it.
---
Yeah this took up too much of my time and patience yesterday. Really drags me down.
---
I‚Äôve got everything at this point...waiting for new event items to drop
---
It‚Äôs really not well done, most people I know who are into Battle Royales say it‚Äôs the worst of the bunch. Fallout mechanics don‚Äôt mix with heavy PvP combat.
---
Happens from time to time, usually when I‚Äôve fully stocked a vendor and crash shortly after.  I can only offer my condolences.

---
I have only logged into NW once in my life, and that was during week one of the challenges (a couple weeks ago) to get score. I‚Äôd be surprised if it affected me weeks later.
---
Sounds like you want more of a deathmatch or capture the flag mode rather than BR. I think I probably enjoy NW more than you, but I'd still like to have more varied PvP options too.
---
And if you "drop" rather than "place" them, they don't return to your inventory after 2 minutes.

They should have made it an either or thing You select when you log in. Or made it so the challenges were pve relevant in pve and changed to PVP in Nuclear Winter. They do have player who just play Nuclear winter  because it‚Äôs fun
---
Granted that would take actual coding skills that Bethesda has so far shown they Just Don‚Äôt Have
---
Figured it out. Go to the Atomic Shop and click on all the Emotes you own so they have a little check mark on them. No idea why the got deselected in the first place...
---
If they wanted to be fair and smart about it they'd make it so you could finish the score through either NW challenges or Adventure challenges, or a combo of both. That way for those that enjoy NW for whatever reason could get their score, adventure mode could get theirs, and we wouldn't have to complain about playing modes we don't want to. Heck if they are worried about people ranking up too fast on the score and thus losing out on folks spending atoms to rank up, lock it to completing 6\~8 daily challenges a day, you finish that many in NW, adventure, or a combo, and the rest stop counting or count for less.
---
I‚Äôm glad to hear this. It‚Äôs never happened to me before so I was worried
---
Ugh. I will neve even play that mode :P
---
I was thinking this last night, but I wondered how that would work when I had used my 5 character slots. But of course, you can delete characters... Never thought about that. Sometimes I can be so dumb :)

Edit for structure.
---
Don't do it
---
It does i just want to believe that steel dawn wont be shit
---
Well you say you understand but your response does not show it. I said that the run is based on play patterns, and NW gets about 1/10 of playtime vs adventure, hence 1/10 of challenge coverage.   
---
On the other hand, I am saying "don't like it, don't do it", and this has to do with the fact that this criticism has merely personal value. It is the view of a group of people that have 0 interest in NW, thus does not reflect the entire player base. In case it is unclear, I do not see your criticism of having a single NW challenge being bad, as valid criticism, and if it were valid criticism, then NW players should be burning down their game copies.  
---
The run is a time and performance based event, like any season in an MMO. It is therefore expected that people that want to finish it, will need to invest time and skill. The rewards are for dedicated players and reward consistent, recurring and dedicated play. They are not supposed to be guaranteed for casual players that only want to play as specific mode only and scarcely. Those that play casually and still absolutely want to have all rewards, are given a way to catch up, with Atoms.
---
Why would you thing that the run would be a casual thing is beyond me.
---
I don‚Äôt like PVP in Fallout 76. When they released the game I was hoping there wouldn‚Äôt be any. There were workshops, but if that‚Äôs all there was going to be, okay. Then there was Nuclear Winter, that was fairly disappointing BUT could totally ignore it as it wasn‚Äôt part of Adventure Mode. But now they‚Äôve added the SCORE challenges that require you to do NW. That‚Äôs kinda where I draw the line. Fuck NW.
---
seems like a pretty simple solution on the surface..
---
The ones you get from events are the rarest apperal in the game
---
The skeleton for the mode is great, having such customizable builds allows for interesting team compositions if you can play with some friends.
---
But the execution is awful.  
---
They should remove the reward ladder and add a legendary run repeatable for NW - to discourage AFK bots.
---
They should let you change your perks and find another match while spectating.
---
They should make V51 available in adventure, add a way to load NW from inside, and shorten the lobby.
---
They should tone down explosives, especially the gauss shotgun.  A reduction to demo expert, or making it not effect the shotgun may be a solution.
---
They shouldn't force compromises to adventure SPECIAL to be effective in NW.
---
Sadly, this is the only place that seems to get acknowledged by developers and the consensus here is that NW shouldn't exist.
---
The hat is not that rare. The red outfit is.
---
Blueprint the vending machines after I did that it never happened. Can't help with display cases though sorry!
---
It's a heavy weapon.
---
I love BR, one of my points is that NW is just a very bad one. My elaboration does stray into making an argument for multiple game modes as well, though, now that you mention it.
---
" The S.C.O.R.E. amount increasing each level makes it harder to keep up. "
---
I feel as if a lot of the complaints would go away if this would be changed to a flat number from start to finish. It's over 3k for the last couple of ranks, that's just absurd.
---
Imagine playing a game you don't enjoy.
---
No, I believe all the hats are static spawns...maybe worth 50-100 caps.
---
Ermm, why? :-)
---
You can‚Äôt. Only the leader can complete it
---
 The even stranger part is you can use the hunting rifle ghillie skin in NW just not the armors.
---
I play normally and generally get most challenges done accidentally. At the end of the night I'll see what's left. It's usually just simple things like "take a photo while in a group" or something equally easy.
---
I'll hop into NW for a game if it's something simple like setting up a CAMP.
---
Not worried about it overall. I think I'm at level 42 of the legendary run.
---
Lol loll FTW
---
I found the red rum blocks at the Torrance house, the maze and blocks clicked.
---
Original like topic starter? Lmao
---
I have a leather coat I got when I was at level 30 from an event. For some reason I was trading with someone and he freaked out when he saw it. So I kept it to this day at level 95
---
I just play and if I hit challenges during the course of having fun, bully for me. Playing to meet the challenges is too grindy and I‚Äôm too old for that shit.
---
Ok. Well maybe battle royale purists don‚Äôt like it. What I will tell you as someone who does not like battle royales, I like it. That‚Äôs my opinion.
---
Good to know! Thanks mate!
---
Yeah that's a cool lever at a good price
---
I agree with getting rid of nw challenges
---
Honestly, the only thing PA desperately needs is being able to use backpacks and underarmor effects. Other than that it‚Äôs pretty good as is.
---
It just sucks that all other builds get to substitute certain perks which are basically a must have (i.e. traveling pharmacy) with weight reducing legendary effects, while I struggle to even have all my combat perks on. 15 STR just isn‚Äôt enough to run everything for heavy weapons - nevermind the utility perks. 
---
And lets not forget that PA needs to be fed with ammo in order to operate. 
---
PA backpacks would be the equalizer, but still not make it completely OP.
---
Writing in Wastelanders was shit, except Weasel.  
---
She bae.
---
Not really need it, everyone overreact about erase the rad from bloody build player. All you need is starched genes and jump straight to water source without aquaboy/girl.
---
Further, if you add an approve system meanwhile doing something important like between combat or anything else, that's a lot of thing to deal.
---
That's my pov.
---
Nope, i stick them in my vendor for 100 caps and the occasional person buys them (probably assuming they're rarer than they actually are)
---
It's the red outfit that's really rare.
---
You know if you had levels banked you had fun just sitting there
---
So true. I wish it used cans like a flamer, 25 shots goes in less than a second.
---
Totally agree. The really is the makings of a great BR in there, but very poorly executed.
---
oh the plushie i wouldnt mind a sb one next season tbh
---
Because that‚Äôs armour. Your build is your perks. With a good bloodied build u can wear 1 star Uny armour and wreck everything. Have large carry weight. Great sneak and accuracy and lots of crits. Conversely with a poor build u can have sent/ap Uny armour in every slot and be crap
---
No weekly NW events please, its already painful enough losing out on the SCORE when the objective is shitty. If I can't complete the goal in one game, fuck it not worth the time. If I wanted to play Battle Royal I would be playing a different game entirely.
---
Everybody who spawns at my camp just spawns in the water. Really nice way of getting a waterborne disease.
---
Different games for different people. People who prefer DOTA over Fallout are likely less interested in immersion. From what I understand DOTA has been a highly competitive numbers game for over a decade that people treat rather like a sport. A huge contingent of fallout players are explorers/modders/survivalists (many other styles too), so yeah if you foist a meta like seasons onto a game that doesn't have the player base to appreciate it - people are gonna trip.
---
This game is literally a chore now
---
im only ate teir 58 after all my grinding bethesda keep it at 100 score and dont be a bunch of dicks
---
The highest one is 3125
---
It's so easy. Just hide until the top 10. You'll get like 800 xp.
---
I get most of my scrip fodder from just running events.  As far as in the wild legendaries, I tend to find the at harpers fairy and westtech more often than white springs.
---
I never paid attention to that level 50 thing - feel so dumb. I‚Äôve been using a new mule (level 35) this weekend bc I‚Äôm so overloaded with legendaries and they keep coming in. The purveyor ‚Äúworks‚Äù for the mule but I didn‚Äôt notice the weapon levels I was getting. Duh Oh !!!! Thanks guess I need to grind the mule some more.
---
Fed76.info has a weapons and armor price estimator that helps with value questions. Using that tool i would say you did very well at 4K.
---
Ach okay we're mincing words here. I tend to include stuff like inventory management in the word, that's what I meant
---
Look at the issue with The Fixer not being able to use combat rifle skins. If I remember correctly, it's all down to a freaking item tag and was recently fixed by a modder on PC. Probably something as idiotic as a the Flatwoods monster not being marked as an alien, thus making a former weekly challenge impossible for upwards of a year after launch.
---
It's not even the intricacies that would require mastery with the Creation Engine. It's the little things that even reading very popular posts here by modders and data miners. They have been doing TONS of great work cataloging issues in extremity detailed posts, only for the overwhelming majority to be ignored.
---
Even worse, so many of the problems come down to simple organization. I'm an elderly computer science major (dropped out decades ago and finally getting a degree) who's only a handful of programming classes in. Even I know about version control... but given the number of times old bugs resurface because they seem to be using an older version of parts of the code base, they don't seem to.
---
You could just take the perk to drop a live grenade when you die and pair that with the explosives perk that makes your explosives do more damage.
---
Railway + auto receiver + vats. All you need to know. F'n brutal. Get one with reduced vats cost and it's damn near free of AP cost to shoot
---
I would charge it from 800 caps to 1500
---
Oh yes I‚Äôm all this! Spiders are some of my favorite monsters.
---
&gt;I never even defended the broken skins I just said they‚Äôll fix it
---
Narrator: They won't.
---
Yeah, my bad, I mixed up Blackwell and Eckhart.
---
Thinking about getting that perk that drops a grenade from your inventory if you have one when you die just to be a petty bitch...
---
I just want some corner stairs, mind boggling how so many basic types of camp building items are missing.
---
I lost about 8k score points so far :( I really hope it's fixed for the next season.
---
Yeah inventory management is easy with a really good build. I have 410 carry weight with a small backpack.......must get around to doing the quest line for the large at some point
---
Good point. We have giant scorpions in a region of the country where they don‚Äôt exist. NV it made sense. WV not so much. Add to that some freakishly large snakes.
---
Why?    
---
They're called Challenges for a reason. If you expect to be handheld and give more and more stuff for free b/c you're unwilling to put in the time and effort that's your problem. I don't play that much and concerning this, I've completed almost every Daily list within a few hours. The internet is full of info especially regarding this game.    
---
Truth is....everyone who wants to hit 100 won't. Like many, I'm not paying real money b/c of my lack of patience. If you have this same mindset IRL......
---
They are easy as pie man
---
That'd be pretty cool. They could ven be made to combat marsupial cheese, either with web slinging to tie you up or being able to climb stuff to get to you.
---
Its personal preference really. The tankier bosses are nearly immune to explosive so I prefer FFR. Also the CND of the weapons degrades much more quickly with explosive effect.
---
I still haven't seen this atom hindrance ive earn over 500 in three days
---
There is a tricycle with blocks that spell out REDRUM on the corner of a porch of a mansion or building like Fort Defiance. And my fave so far is a stuffed grizzly, panda and polar bear stacked as a tribute to We Bare Bears. That one is located at the palace of the winding temple.
---
There's some woosh in this thread
---
My criticism of the dailys is that there should be an option to do NW challenges OR adventure mode so you can flip flop between the two and not have to play just one side or play a side you dont want to play. Thats it. That way even if 1 in 100 players want to play NW then they can go right ahead. This also doesn't stop bethesda from getting their NW numbers up as they can easily set it as.
---
My criticism isn't based solely on having the NW dailys. It's that there could be a better system that benefits both sides with very minimal effort. If you cant see that and say "yea that makes sense" then this goes nowhere. 
---
"Do something tedious on adventure or place camp/play x amount of games, " etc
---
I literally can not stress this enough im not arguing on if the run should be casual or not that is an entirely different issue. 
---
By the way I've said it already, but I don't do NW dailys. I dont like em and I dont do em. Still gonna criticize em.
---
The challenges are really easy, it only takes me a couple hours doing the daily's and that's just taking my time with them.
---
Yes.  You can craft a level 50 if you have the plan.  Check player vendors for the plan or the weapon.
---
People would blame Bethesda for reusing assets from Skyrim (which is perfectly fine). The whole giant spider is kind of an overused fantasy trope as well.
---
I like it, could have them hiding on the ceiling in dark caves/buildings, waiting to drop on unsuspecting players.
---
Most people play with potato internet and could support a private sever which has a minimum require ment to support several players
---
They need to change how XP is awarded in the game mode and that alone would go a long way. Right now it‚Äôs set up so people benefit from hiding in a bush more than they do from killing things which is an awful way to set it up. Also not to mention even when you win the game the amount of xp is so small that many times it‚Äôs not enough to even level you up which makes the game mode as a whole a hide and seek grind game with hackers about killing everyone.
---
you know you can do easier and quicker 5x repeatable challenge than that NW right? What you complain about? When you dont like NW or play only for SCORE there is no way to try to make NW challenges...
---
Touch your nose, 1 billion score
---
Just run from vault to a couple of locations nearby, and or just run To the wayward, spam collect river water untill your almost dead from radiation poisoning, then Boil all the water Or craft away all of your mats.
---
Many thanks sir.
---
While I like the concept, although it needs alot of polish still, this pvp mod just doesn't work on Bethesdas shitty engine / netcode or whatever.
---
Fallout 76 still feels like an ps2 game, when it comes to movement. Who the he'll tought it would be a good idea to implement a pvp mod on something like that?
---
I agree. When you see more people making a new character just for this challenge, then gameplay wise, it's not a really fun and smart thing to do.
---
But I think the concept of Seasons as a whole is no fun. It has a high level of fomo and it seems a lot of people are susceptible to this and feel pressured into getting score (myself included). It detracts from the fun this game can offer. During this double score weekend I'm seeing myself frantically trying to find 3 bubblegum and having no fun at all in the process...
---
My lesson was: just play the game the way you want to and to hell with some of the nice stuff at the end of the legendary run. Now I just have to put it into practice :)
---
The explains why one of my fixers in always missing from the wheel.
---
They are safe for regular use in 99.9% of situations. If you have a glitched camp that is over budget, and your vendor machines are directly beside your camp spawn point, then a player who knows where your vendors are can travel in and access your stash, if they are fast enough. It is a very limited window to exploit, and I‚Äôve never had it happen to me since player vending was introduced.
---
I've got a bloodied one I'd give you . . . I think. A guy was buying up my shop this morning, and I didn't check what he bought. Anyways, not a great weapon for bloodied, but still.
---
Mine still doesnt work.
---
that's way I'm migrating to another MMO till they realizes that those cap are killing the player base(and the lack of endgame Content) but in ps4 we don't have many options.
---
Copperhead would be a great touch, you could add poison damage or maybe a spitting ability like mirelurk hunters.
---
There's a connector that lets you put cables through walls? What? I've been putting cables through windows all this time.
---
At most the Daily's have taken me 3 hours maybe a bit more. They are pretty easy but some require finding Legendary enemies or a short list of ones you must kill for that Challenge.    
---
I jumped 3 levels yesterday and one day 4 levels. I think I'm 54 right now and haven't played for today. I don't think much is going to change. The rewards are set.

IMO, the reward for the end of each section should be a Legendary but not at random. You would get an item that when opened brought you to a screen. You would pick:  
---
1. Gear or weapon. You could choose what armor type (Scout, Metal, etc) or Handgun, Melee(1hd,2hd), Rifle, Heavy, etc. Then you choose which weapon: combat rifle, Laser Rifle, etc. Then if 1 to 3 star you get to pick which effect(s). That way you get a personalized weapon of your choosing and 3 chances to get all three.
---
Oh yeah there‚Äôs that too. I have like 6 of each ultracite armor limb for sale atm.
---
In terms of rolls, you generally want to avoid any VATS perks with heavy weapons.  The main prefix is pretty standard...Bloodied, Junkies, AA, Furious, and maybe Two Shot and Vampire's. 2nd star FFR, explosive are the best, but aim damage is decent too.  And fast reload or 90% reduce weight for the 3rd star.
---
FFR vs Explosive is more personal preference.  FFR is a flat 25% increase in DPS...where explosive is a 20% increase in single shot damage.  Explosive damage can also be increased with the demolitions expert perk card.  If you're looking for a weapon to prime for the SBQ, go with FFR or aim damage.  I believe the queen is mostly immune to explosive damage, so it's not a great option in that scenario.
---
The scout armor masks (which also come with the BOS, Whitesprings, and White Powder jumpsuits) can drop from any Savage Divide quest. I got mine from One Violent Night.
---
The double score is already factored in. 250 normally, 500 now. The level up one gives 500 normally, 1000 now.
---
Explosive makes the gun much powerful because it turns into a hitscan weapon instead
---
When I run out of vendor caps, vendor scrip, dailies that are worth doing, and challenges, I will start server hopping to farm plans to put in my vendor.  I usually have more money coming in by vending these than I get from selling crap.  That said, I do also keep a set of weight-reduction armour and Bear Arms perk, so i can literally carry 100x as many heavy weapons to sell as soon as the vendor caps reset.
---
Lol there isn't, and if there still is to you you can't apply it
---
Like I said, I like the mode as well, but having limited time to play and then having to do this massive grind of ranking up once in 24h is just a pain. I don't want them to remove it, more like making this one a Weekly instead of a daily quest.
---
I play Fortnite with my 7 y/o and hes pretty good. From time to time I will let him play a NW match with me watching and coaching. He usually gets several kills and tends to do pretty good at it. If people only knew they were getting smoked by a 7 y/0 lol.
---
I think it's great fun, just wish we had more maps.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Love it... How about some daily SCORE points for all the storage this game uses...
---
Thank you but, i will probably not do Bloodied this time arround.
---
I have another character that is bloodied, so im doing something different this time.
---
Thank you for the kind offer.
---
Stop trying to gas light
---
There might be one already, considering there's r/fo76bearhunt
---
Raising my hand as well.  I do not have the original captain cosmos bundle and lack the ability to craft the bubble helmet.
---
it doesn't take much to host a single player instance. which is what a lot of us want. if you want to host your own server for multiple people, of course you're gonna need a beefier system or hire a hoster.
---
but that's besides the point. because that would crush their revenue stream. that's the real reason why actual private servers aren't a thing.
---
Yes, all challenges are very easy to do and you can do it in one or two matches, but it takes at least 3 wins to level up once on my level. The game shouldn't force you to make an additional Charakter.
---
For some reason what comes to mind for me was Cobra Commander from the old GI Joe movie when he was turned into a snake, ‚ÄúI was once a man. Oncccccceee aaaaa maaaaannnn!‚Äù
---
Yes.    
---
I've only played NW with my main char and not that much since it came out. I HATE/LOATHE pvp.
---
I believe the Junkie's LMG was one of those "magic" weapons that could do crazy amounts of damage -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo\_8XKVqGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo_8XKVqGQ) 
---
I've heard it was patched on the PTS server at one point, but I haven't tested to see if it's actually fixed.
---
Use Marathoner or Action Boy/Girl if you want to sprint more, you'll just have to sacrifice a perk slot for something that's probably more useful.
---
Yes but the streaks should break...they often don't break on the "streaky" servers, at least not in a reasonable number of crafts/rolls.  Thats why Ive found its best to hop when you start to see one.
---
How do you see your budget numbers like that?
---
People not getting sarcasm will never get old.
---
Have game crash (automatic level up)
---
I mean they can just drop support and make paid dlcs if youd rather have to pay for content over cosmetics instead and also most of the single player elitist have left this sub a while back most are sherpas or new players now
---
What are you talking about? The dailies now gives 500 scores (and 1000 for the level up). Other days, they gives 250 (and 500 for the level up).
---
So, this weekend, they give double points.
---
This one should be a Weekly. Would be much more relaxing playing on a day you feel like "yay NW" and also takes away the stress of time for those with limited time like me.
---
Agreed.  I‚Äôm level 250 in Adventure, play an hour or so most days with the occasional weekend binge, and haven‚Äôt focused on leveling up until now.  Only played NW a bit to get the Halloween items.  I‚Äôve been playing NW again for about a week, and found it kind of refreshing (You won‚Äôt hear: ‚ÄúFinally, someone with the guts to help.‚Äù in NW).  Leveled to 26 this morning for the reward, took 5 matches and was pretty fun.  The best part about picking it up again was opening 100+ card packs and getting most of the current NW rewards from duplicate card points.  Not my cup of tea, but the quest pulled me back in.  I now start my daily play with a NW match, can meet most of those easy challenges in one match (place a camp in NW, okay!).  If the daily challenge is going to be a NW time sink, I may skip after the first match.  Choice: To each their own.
---
I mostly have extra characters due to both wanting to do new builds but liking my existing ones too much. Nice work by the way.
---
It‚Äôs a shame. I make a fresh character and run them through level 1 just because I can‚Äôt be bothered to rank my main. It‚Äôs ridiculous how hard leveling gets later on if you‚Äôre not an avid fan of NW
---
I have just started the game with a good friend of mine. Whe have had a hell of a good time just learning the game and for once having a game we can enjoy together. 
---
The Wastelanders quests are really good, and we are basically just awed by the amount of things to do. I am aware of the idea behing ‚Äùseason passes‚Äù on these kind of games. To lock down already invested players for grinding and investing (time and/or money) even more. 
---
The good thing is that as we are only at the beginning, we couldn‚Äôt give a shit about time gated bullshit, so we leave it be.
---
If you're on a team and have stranger in numbers, the 20% boost from cranberry relish becomes 25%, too!
---
I've been doing all the daily and weekly challenges for the dark matter skin and currently at level 38 on the pass. Am I in a good spot to get there?
---
Agreed. I just ignore it when it's a level up. If it's something like setting a CAMP I'll do it, but I hate NW
---
You could take a pic of someone crouched in front of those udders from behind. Then you wouldn't be able to tell exactly what they're doing, the viewer would draw their own conclusions. Almost sounds like we're setting someone up for blackmail
---
I am sure there will be another double challenge weekend or even double XP. Plenty of time to get Lvl 100.
---
Ooofff, 4k bullion to waste now
---
Noob Question: what is this NW you all speak of?
---
Also Overseer rank ? I thought it was end game stuff tbh
---
I would do that but I'm a relatively aggressive Player with 10+ Kills per round but each kill is just 30 XP if you calculate the downing of a player in. Making kills should be more viable.
---
As others told me, you can not get banned for it, but it permanently feeds up your camp budget. Even if you move your camp.
---
I'm on PC, and while I don't deny it absolutely WAS full of hackers at one point, I haven't seen any in a fair while.
---
Hell no I have a phobia of spiders. This would ruin the game
---
I just ignore this challenge
---
I hope they remove it
---
and they are already in the game! Just give them to us!!!
---
Um.... what are you talking about?
---
Doesn't it need certain stats on though and a fire rate above 200 or as close to? Mine was faster reload and a crap stat like bash damage. It didn't feel magic, it was just so quick to reload it felt like you'd never stop firing lol.
---
Very cosy
---
Original in general. Just because somebody jumps off a bridge doesn't mean you have to as well.
---
I mean how about VARIETY in displays? I have the Thanksgiving and it makes no sense that they just stopped at the one atomic display case
---
Oh well it's already placed so may as well give back :)
---
Honestly, it's fine the way it is. Why? Because it's the only **challenge** that is remotely challenging. Join a group? 250 Score. Buy 3 bullets? Another 250. Eat Bubblegum? MORE SCORE! There are days you can hit the Gold Star challenge by hopping to a team mate's camp and doing menial actions. There should be one or two challenges a week that are actual challenges and not just a list of things you probably do in a play session anyway.
---
But, as many others have stated, make a new character. It's possible to rank up in one match. And if people don't want to do that, just get 30,000xp, that more than makes up for what they lost from not wanting to debase themselves by playing Nuclear Winter.
---
Oh look another complainer who doesn‚Äôt even know what he is talking about.
---
They just create visiblity of player activity with all that content recycling.
---
Ppl on this Reddit wouldnt recognize sacrasm even it would be FFing them.
---
Especially when 75% of the people are hinding I  bushes
---
Yes, if you were trying to launch from alpha, change servers, and go back to alpha, clear the silo, and when it comes to to put the card in you will not need a card since the silo remembers you already put one in but did not launch. But if you were trying to launch from alpha and attempt to launch from either of the two other silos you will need a card since your card is in alpha.
---
The Battle Royale Mode "Nuclear Winter" short NW. The Overseers Rank is just like your level in that mode.
---
i DO the legendary run and i DONE CARE about all that fuzz going on about it. i just play.
---
That makes more sense, thanks.
---
That trailer was before the game released. They didn‚Äôt even have plans for human NPCs then, why would they have plans for the brotherhood to return?
---
I‚Äôm officially up to 22k score lost after today.
---
Ohhhhh
---
I had no idea fo76 had a Battle Royale Mode
---
Real fun is people constantly overstating how many cheaters you actually run into playing the mode.  Since the season started and I've had to regularly play at least a match a day I've run into one hacker.  One.
---
Only rare when you want one. I accidentally scrapped my red hat (thought it was my uniform and shit myself). So i went looking for one. 20 trips into fort defiance and could i find one? NEWP! Eventually found one in a vendor for 50 caps. WOO!
---
Want a price guide for the uniforms?
---
Yeah, if the challenge is drop a camp, or kill players/creatures, I'll play on my main (NW level 70ish), but if it's level up, over to the alt (L5 now) to open up some more perk packs.
---
PAM'S HOUSE!! üíñüíñüíñ I was hoping so bad that Monster Factory would get a shout-out in 76, especially because of the WV connections, but I wasn't sure if it'd be on the radar enough to get one.
---
Shame they disliked the game so much. :')
---
Pretty minor, but also found a reference to It in the Whitesprings Golf Club, too. There's a clown in a fridge with a red balloon. And of course, there's Loss.jpg...
---
most of them left the game, you mean. and yes, I'd rather pay up front instead of having to deal with their bs. that's my point.
---
and keep in mind I don't mean cosmetics when I say "mobile-esque monetization bs", but rather how every aspect of the game is handled. from artificially limiting resources and storage to force players to grind, but no too much so they don't burn through the little content there is, to "dailies" making people log in daily if they want their virtual currency and not having to deal with FOMO.
---
every aspect of Fo76 is based around mobile monetization and that's a disgrace.
---
Price websites suck
---
Oh look another rude ass instead of finding out if I may have a bug üôÑ
---
Have you found the Skyrim prisoner cart yet?
---
That's a feature not a bug. You dont lose you nuke virginity until you have a crash during a silo run
---
Good one üòÅ
---
This should count for a score daily ü§™
---
Exaxtly! Mine is only showing 250
---
Are you on Steam ?
---
Wtf are you even talking about
---
Yea I know, every time I've pulled it up mine shows 250
---
Please give us all CAMP building things in FO4 that are not currently in FO76. Makes no sense that they wouldn't all be there since this game is building on that game's CAMP system.
---
I‚Äôve heard you need to move and then delete the blueprints for them
---
It's the one thing to the right, it's actually quite fun, espicially when playing in a team that communicates with you.
---
Mine keep saying 250!
---
That is brilliantly smart, thank you for the idea :D
---
Yeah I'm going to do the same.
---
Why does the sink disappoint you?
---
The sink itself is clean, not the pipesystem :)
---
Mule account clearing some space.
---
Wtf 5 of my dailies auto completed I‚Äôm so mad
---
If you have unwanted .38 ammo, I will gladly take it üòÅ
---
I really think they just have a list of random challenges that they /100 to see what ones pop up.
---
No xbox
---
Wow, looks great. I love when people decorate in all the nooks and crannies, instead of just a huge ass room with a few workbenches. It‚Äôs really eye catching to look at all the wall decorations and other decor.
---
Okay but like why not protect the NPCs then? And if you want xp then keep the npcs alive while people deposit ore cause the higher the ore rank the higher the xp mobs will give.
---
I do not see why I could possibly be in the wrong for wanting people to put in like just a few more button inputs worth of effort to keep the event from failing.
---
Yes, it's annoying as hell...
---
Others said, it will be burned to your camp budget permanently. I do not have one and I wont test it out...
---
I don't want to keep track lol I'm sure I'm pretty close to there too.
---
It's a start. You good a better way to price guide? Besides asking on reddit about every piece of gear you get? I'm truly curious.
---
The moble esque stuff your complaining about is cosmetic and it pays for free dlc . but you want a payed dlc for the game that your just gonna run thru. I know this is a hard thing to realise but you dont have to play everyday to get the stuff and this is easly the most lenient season pass ive played and most people have played
---
Can you post a pic please? For me, it shows the doubled amount. Thank you!
---
I can't be late for work if I don't go lol
---
I‚Äôm all good at this point mate! I just needed to know if they are rare
---
Yo I'll help in any way bro üòÅ I'll dm when I'm on
---
With the rate I‚Äôm going, I‚Äôm planning on realistically ‚Äúbuying‚Äù about 10 levels, assuming I don‚Äôt get hit on the weekly challenges again as well as only one or two autocompletes a week.
---
Because somebody in the first team thinks it's fine to have an open mic.
---
Do he really need to put /s? Never heard about sarcasm?
---
It‚Äôs not though. It uses some formula from 1 dude. Prices are constantly fluctuating and the value of something changes from person to person, there‚Äôs no definitive value of items
---
Nukes and Dragons site. Find/make a build and stick with it. You can't have everything and expect to have a good character. For me, a StealthSniper with VATS is the best.    
---
Always have a backup weapon and if a firearm one that has a separate ammo type.    
---
In the beginning pick up/scrap almost anything you can find. You will get some gear rewards for completing quests. Some quests net leveled gear based on that char's level. They are best saved for after level 50.    
---
Follow the Overseer's questline and get the stuff from her boxes. All contain goods but plans for the CAMP. Build a Tinkerer's and Weapon's workbench asap. At minimum, that plus a covered small building with a bed, Stash, and Cooking station. Don't go all crazy in making your camp better. When you can build the Chem and Armorer stations.    
---
Corn soup provides both Food and Water so you can carry lots without eating up weight of separate food and water items. Early on it takes a lot fo start making a dent in your Stash. Store the Chems and food/drink items that don't degrade. There have been challenges which require Chewing Bubble gum x1 or Eat Pre-War food x20.    
---
Take on the Seasons thing. You can still do enough to net you a lot of good things.    
---
Almost all Legendary enemies drop a Legendary item. Even if your char can't use it you can sell it or scrap it for Script at the Rusty Pick. Script is used to by various things from that vendor. IMO, this is best done after 50.    
---
Play the game and enjoy it. There are a lot of challenges which can net rewards mostly in free Atoms.    
---
The game doesn't pause so I you're doing a lot in the Pipboy make sure you're safe and hidden. You can sell/convert ammo you don't want. There's an item in one of the building menus.  Daily and Event quests are good in XP and items. Free stuff is always good. When you start amassing more caps take a Workshop or two. You get free stuff and Plans.
---
1. As you rank up, new rooms will become available to you to explore. Unfortunately you only have the time you spend in lobby to explore. 
---
2. Atom shop apparel section. If you own items there you can favorite them and those are what you will wear in NW. 
---
3. Perks. Just because you have the jump on someone doesn‚Äôt mean that they aren‚Äôt perked out to hurt you quicker. Start to study different approaches and tactics and analyze your perks so you can change your setup to one you can do damage with too.
---
Awesome üëç Thank you!
---
did you really downvote me for that? I'm on vacation so i cant play. so i cant get this glitch.
---
They are normal for me.  
---
Post a pic so we can see?
---
&gt;I generally like to drop into high traffic zones in battle royale games  because I‚Äôm there for the combat but I enter every match knowing I need  to drop close to the center so that I don‚Äôt have to worry about  sprint-walking to zone. 
---
You don't have to drop near the center to do anything.  When I play the morgantown map I drop into the steel mill that's a decent 75% of the way to the edge of the map... I have enough time to hack three consoles and go looking for chests with time to spare to always make it to the next circle long before the fire even reaches me.
---
If you like having a lot of ap to sprint... then use the fucking perks?  You can set both Action Boy for more AP regen and Marathoner for reduced ap cost to sprint.
---
I only lost 1250, at the third day. I hope I wont lost more...
---
I hope you can finish the Run.
---
I was online today and 4 of mine auto completed, but when I looked it was 4 of yesterday‚Äôs challenges. I relogged and it fixed it
---
Will have to keep this in mind if I am lucky enough to get one. LMAO over here.
---
You're on the development team? The marketing team? No? Than it's your opinion, not fact.
---
Last week all except one did Autocomplete. I was pissed too.
---
I think they also limit/balance the amount of F1st players on servers. I don't think I ever see more than 4 players.
---
Funny fact about the sink.. if you drink it straight from the tap, it only adds 5 rads(same as boiled water) dirty water adds 15
---
It‚Äôs one score among many. Some people, like myself, are fine running NW. I‚Äôve won a couple and lost more than I can count, but it still gets you xp in adventure even if you hole up in a house and hide the whole time.
---
Having multiple avenues to gain score isn‚Äôt a problem. If it bugs you so much run it on a new character and get it quickly.
---
9 days until patch 21, 6 weeks (+ a few days) until the end of this season
---
Yeah no problem! What guns even use .38 rounds? I've never used mine
---
I‚Äôm at 56 now, so not too far behind.  I thought of a few different ways to bump ahead, just don‚Äôt want to do anything too extreme.  A friend of mine is in the exact same boat.  He‚Äôs at 16k score lost, thought about buying atoms at GameStop or something, putting on account to buy levels, then doing a chargeback on his cc.
---
Well you never know with Todd , All of this could have been planned
---
Made the same experience today as well.
---
Have a char I want to level up but it seems as i‚Äòm under lvl 50 my shared inspirational 2 wasn‚Äôt good enough. 
---
Made my own team, other ppl joined, had a good time.
---
I usually get that bug at encryptid. Thought I found a unique version of a junk item. Turned out to be a players name
---
I love this. Clever way to circumvent devs trying to push more PVP. 
---
Fallout76 is a buggy annoying micro transaction pushing mess, the only reason I still enjoy it so much is how non-toxic the community is.
---
yeah what there really should be is an identifier showing how many plans you know, from what the vendor is selling
---
there are pros and cons to both. 
---
T65 - Mods are easyish to get.. with enough gold, it is new, and looks cool. But the DR and ER kind of overflow to the point where it does not seem to make much difference, and limited selections of skins currently
---
Strangler - Grants the Acid Set bonus and more RR then normal Ultracite (500) but Uses Ultracite PA mods and compatible skins meaning rare Ultracite mods will be a HUGE pain to unlock (Calibrated shocks, Emergency Protocols, Targeting Hud)
---
That's not going to stop people that don't even play  the mode from complaining about cheaters though.  Ever since this season started and I've been regularly doing a match of NW a day, or more during the double exp weekend or if I'm close to ranking up, and I've run into a single cheater the entire time.  And they weren't even using a particularly egregious cheat, just a wall hack to see where people were and not the old standard of flying across the map with infinite AP shooting into the ground and killing everyone within a mile instantly.
---
buy serums off player vendors yo
---
RNGing mutations is a drag...
---
C‚Äômon Bethesda they have to be better I feel like this is just a tactic to force the consumer to spend money if they want to reach the end of the run
---
1). Not really. You get 2 mins before the match to explore in. Lots of it is locked and only becomes available as you rank up. So exploring is done between matches rather than at once. Since you need to get to a high level to open it all up anyway, you have lots of opportunities.
---
2). Different outfits are in the atom shop. Some were given for free with 1st, some are unlocked by playing NW during certain periods, and some are simply bought with atoms. There were also some from twitch prime.
---
3). Not really enough info to tell - do you have show damage numbers on; what was shown etc?
---
I suck at nw.. so this seems like a valid use of my time and perks, plus its amusing being a petty bitch like this in that game mode lol
---
You are damn right i am lucky i did not level up before now i can easily do that challenge by afking
---
Worth doing just because one of the quickest dailies to do. Congrats man first thing I did with it was stick it on my ally in camp
---
I guess they are expensive aren't they? I'm pretty new. Got like 4k caps
---
Same. Except for the free weekend back in February or whenever that was. That was rough. I feel that most people who talk about cheaters have seen a cheater a single time, had a bad experience, and then just complain about it being a larger issue than it really is.
---
You will eventually get there, just keep on going! :D
---
The site is a good place to go for a few things  which provide a little incentive to go and grind out the dailies  (lead, guaranteed stealth boy/bobblehead/magazine points so long as no one else has hit it yet, raider power armor,  2 fusion cores, and weapons to sell from the hostile mobs) that refund the travel cost to get there . There is even a decent chance of getting a heavy (non legendary) gun out of the safe in the park office out back. Its a good place to take alts that is not some location in the forest or toxic valley, with minimal effort.
---
That does look really cool.  Where is that?
---
What fun!  Love all the details, makes it look real.  
---
I will make use of putting flowers on the Chem workstation, methinks.
---
Yeah I don't see why not, there's repeatable experience gained.
---
If you start doing events,it's not that hard to max scrips
---
You should meet my friend Paragraph.
---
Nah, do not pay for it if its above 600 caps. You can find cheaper too.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs just refreshes the vendors inventory so you have a chance at getting what you were looking for. We‚Äôd all be banned if this was that big of an issue. He‚Äôll I found a spawn point for the vendor bot so I might be double banned lol. Ive used that to my advantage more then once.
---
So the people that do like NW shouldn't be rewarded for playing? Nah hard disagree.
---
I don't like NW at all but I feel it's fair for them to be rewarded for thier time.
---
That is entitlement though, you're complaining about a game mode because you refuse to play it and also complaining about not being able to earn the 250/500 score, because you refuse to play it.
---
I noticed that even when making your own team as a lower level - ppl kinda bypass it. Glad you had better luck with it !!!!
---
It also sucks when you run to a pylon to help during the event then get the notification that the sheepsquatch has been killed and then you can‚Äôt find it.
---
Request sent
---
Gutsy doesnt give a flying *beep* what your armour rating or perks are. I swear they all are wielding armour piercing round arms
---
Doing events that have legendary enemies. At lower levels doing Uranium Fever gets you a chance at 3.  Scorched Earth at least 2 items, AWol Armaments is decent 1-3.  Encryptid will have at least 1.
---
You should meet my friend, Comma.
---
This is what I was looking for, seems like t65 first then strangler a set to slower work on. Thank you for the input
---
That seems to be a lot of work for just 18ish caps a pop
---
It is right above the Monorail Elevator. There is a tower thing there where a few raiders camp under it. It's probably my favorite spot in the game!
---
20 hours after your purchase. So if you bought bullion at 12p, you can buy it tomorrow at 8a
---
typically they run between 350-500 caps per.. dont pay more than that
---
also when I get a new toons Starched genes unlocked.. I just take that days daily caps limit from vendors and shop around until I get what I want.. I only run 2 or at most 3 mutations depending on the toon so that usually works out perfect [for me]
---
It finally straightened out after logging off and back on twice. Thank you for not being rude!
---
Thanks so much! Yes I love decorating with fine details, but I wish it was a little easier in this game.
---
Because a lot of us are camp builders and I couldn't care less about caps, scripts or gold. Also the rewards are lame, at least with atoms I got to choose what I wanted to buy.
---
The Join world seems too difficult , I would suggest Pressing Start on the main menu would be more simple :)
---
Every 20 hours since you last took gold I think. Have you brought your weeks worth from the american man?
---
What's wrong with stealing a workshop from someone? Isn't part of this game PVP?
---
Wow I never even thought of that being a reason to leave . Didn‚Äôt know it would auto complete another persons quest- thanks for the info !
---
Just make a new character for only dailies
---
Logged out and back in twice it finally shows the correct score amount. Thanks!
---
Know what people did with their excess legendaries before scrip was a thing?  They dropped them in random containers in train stations or sold them to npc vendors or just didn't even fucking pick them up to begin with.
---
You don't need to squeeze every single drop of value out of something.
---
Yeah I got 300 billion yesterday. 20 hours, huh? Guess I‚Äôll get it tomorrow then
---
maybe confusing serums with the plans which are quite expensive?
---
Stealing this idea. I'm the same way, I only claim them for the daily and never go back to them
---
Ok but dont you have to have a decent amount of caps to fast travel everywhere or no
---
You can get the glowing skeleton in nuclear winter now. Halloween, winter and the wastelanders stuff is all active at once due to a bug. 
---
Found out a week ago. 1st few games gave me a ton of stuff. Just finished getting the fur jacket. Which takes the longest
---
&gt;The moble esque stuff your complaining about is cosmetic
---
no, it's not. I literally highlighted this in my previous post. I have nothing against cosmetics. what I do take issue with is how the mechanics in the game are handled, to be as unfriendly as possible and maximize profits.
---
&gt;and it pays for free dlc
---
and my point is that, if they have to make the entire game geared towards that singular goal, to the point it hurts the actual experience, which is exactly what's happened with Fo76, then yes. I'd rather pay for DLC instead.
---
maybe then we'd get some quality content rather than wastelanders.
---
&gt;but you want a payed dlc for the game that your just gonna run thru
---
I get the feeling you think busywork equals content. it doesn't. I replayed the Fo4 DLCs multiple times, because they're quality content. I'm being forced to repeat Ward's fetch quest ad nauseum, not because it's enjoyable, but because they couldn't be bothered to make actual content and decided to pad it out instead.
---
&gt;I know this is a hard thing to realise but you dont have to play everyday
---
but I *want* to play everyday. I just don't want deal with Bethesda's bs along the way. I waste an hour every single day doing my daily chores like a good boy before I can actually get to playing. but would you look at that, I'm low on ammo. so I need to waste another hour gathering resources. and let's not forget juggling my thirst, hunger and limited storage space on top of it.
---
Entitlement here would be saying I deserve the score. I'm saying there is a better way to make the system to get the score. 
---
I'm not complaining about not getting the score. I purposely do not play it, score be damned. I refuse to play it. So I lose out on score so what? I still won't play it they can keep their score. 
---
I literally never complained once that I can't get the max score per day. I said that it can be changed to be a better system to fit all. That is not by definition Entitlement.
---
Not too sure about this one. I was in a server where I got 2 bloody weapons in the space of 5 mins, went to miss moley but she just served me baloney, no bloody stuff just pipe weapons and a broadsider lol
---
Yet I still dont hear a better suggestion.  Half the time I ask on reddit for a price check i get nothing. I think you miss the point it not about a "definitive value" people mostly want a suggestive value and better community input. I for one dont expect a one size fits all price but there a lot of traders on there that you would think could take a minute to suggest a price and the more the merrier. But when there's nothing else this help more than you I feel. I mean the guy asked a question on his haggling and all you did was say what the other guy suggested was not valid. On that note I will say he did ok nothing to special but he should be happy not to pay 7k for the rifle.
---
It's no more annoying than the "level up" challenge in adventure mode, which one could argue is a crappy challenge as well.
---
And yes, NW dailies should be a thing.  You still have 8 daily challenges if you choose to skip NW.
---
Think it‚Äôs like the purveyor. 20 hours from the point u take
---
I was ready to see someone lvl 500  here as topic starter, but lvl 30... Just follow story quests and join some events, grab workshops and defend them (they can spawn legendaries too)
---
Yeah, really. It's all free and optional.
---
I use mine against the queen
---
I clear out every single ghoul at whitespring. Along with the extra enemies that sometimes spawn there. I get about 2-3 legendary enemies. 
---
I go to Welch station and I kill all the mole miners nearby. Usually 3 legendary enemies. Sometimes none. 
---
Top of the world. I kill every enemy around that area. The cabins. The houses. The resort all that. Usually get 2-3 legendary enemies. 
---
I shop around and look for any cheap legendary armor or weapons that people are selling. I‚Äôll pay up to 100 caps for a 1 star. Sometimes you get people selling 3 star weapons or armor. Not saying it‚Äôs amazing magic rolls, but it‚Äôs definitely cheap script for me to buy and then sell. 
---
Plus I buy legendary modules from the mole miner. And try to. Craft specific weapons or armor. And whatever useless crap I get. I end up scrapping for script. I end up having over 5-6 legendary weapons and armor left over for the next day. 
---
I complete events. I usually play for about 2-3 hours and I end up doing about 10 events or more. Not just public events, regular events that pop up nearby.
---
What system are you on?
---
I'm sure it's to try to entice people like me who bored of the mode and stopped playing it to "come back". Just not interested in it, thanks, especially with the heavy cheating going on. I'll live with 8/9 (or 6/7 or whatever) dailies completed each day.
---
How exactly can I do that
---
What most people do is they get their ass kicked by a cheater, immediately requeue for a new game and get matched up with the same exact cheater that just finished cleaning up the rest of the map.  Then they rage that bethesda hadn't banned them within the three minutes since they submitted a report.
---
Logging out and back in the 2nd time they straightened out finally. Thankfully!
---
Agreed.
---
I never said he shouldn‚Äôt be happy. In fact, I never said anything about the guy buying the rifle. All I said was price checking tools don‚Äôt work
---
I'm done youve clearly never played a mmo style game take the w leave me alone there is no gain from talking to you since your gonna argue facts with feelings good job epstein
---
Events and farming places like west tec, white springs, anywhere that lots of enemies spawn
---
And others are welcome to disagree with those opinions. Just because one person thinks they should chnage something, doesn't mean you're going to get a community consensus...
---
I like it, free stuff is always welcome üëÄ
---
Totally agreed, but still there were couple I liked a lot. Wallpapers, fireplace door, planetarium lamps - all that fit quite nicely in my cozy camp.
---
those 3 rare mod plans may be find-able on a trading sub reddit. but expect to shill out a  big chunka caps for em. unless you can get lucky and they spawn from a queen drop.
---
Action boy/girl helps with the AP regen issue.  It can also be worth taking something like "run for your knife", which makes you move faster with a melee weapon equipped.
---
I've only been playing it a few weeks ago and have only come across it once (well twice).  Two matches in a row, same guy.  Fricken stupid but it got me extra xp for placing at the end.  Apparently his crappy hack software isn't able to target non moving targets in a bush LMAO.
---
lol this game is utter garbage
---
NW is just boring.  Last night I decided to skip the NW SCORE chalenge. 20 mins of waiting to be killed by a high level even though I have the drop on them is not fun.  The SCORE challenge has made me hate NW.
---
Goes great with the "gift" icon when you want to give someone something as well.
---
Yeah, the plans are, but the serums are cheap.
---
I am gonna finish this season just because it is the first one. But unless the next gonna have a lot better rewards I doubt it I am gonna grind again.
---
Pc gamepass
---
But it doesn‚Äôt do any damage if you compare it to bloodied melee or fixer
---
If there was no scrip limit. Players like myself with endless caps would just continually buy up scrip from vendors and roll roll roll with legendary mods. Has to be a limit. Gold maybe not as your just buying plans with it. Not the ability to make the weapons and armour endlessly
---
I set up my camp 3 times the other day then stood in the open dancing the Mothman üòäüëç I was killed but laughed my ass off, good times.
---
I am happy that is fixed for you :)
---
What system are you
---
I know you didnt say anything about the guy buying the rifle.... I just said that.... like literally what I just said.
---
Xbox why
---
God that laser assaultron attack would do iron man proud, watched sheepsquatch melt 3 players in 2 second with that beam before
---
It's become just a standard understood thing in the community that "Nuclear Winter on PC is full of hackers" and it's frustrating honestly since it's not any more.
---
Ah that's cool. I'll try to find them on player shipped then. Thans
---
Ok gotchu which are the ones you want to do
---
I don't know if you are able yet to handle the tougher locations, but I more than max my scrip every day running through the DMV/Golf Course/Westek.   Usually get a minimum of 6 legendaries per loop and a ton of xp.  The DMV IMO is the best location in the game for finding legendaries.  I've had as many as 6 in one pass, but more often it is 3.  Definitely better than the golf course or Westek.  Make sure to boot department B when you enter, and Department C before you exit.  Give it a while before you leave, you should get 10 more ghouls after booting department C, almost always at least one legendary.
---
Yes i do not care for it I only wanted my space wallpapers. Now i got it i am done not even going to try to finish the run.
---
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt realize you could build there, very cool!
---
Not if you're afk? 0 work involved. Start a team go do what ever you want. I've gotten 40 caps on a lot of team quests. When you have 3 other people doing stuff, it'll add up enough. 
---
If doesn't require any effort, people are going to do it. If I'm team leader I have full control to make sure people aren't mooching.
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
I have played several mmos. which is why I steer clear off them nowadays. except Bethesda advertised Fo76 as a "play however you want" game and forgot to mention the mmo/mobile bs would be shoved down my throat regardless.
---
I love TES. you think I ever played ESO? no, I never touched it. because it's a mmo and nothing else. that's not what Fo76 is, or what it was supposed to be.
---
why do you think so many people returned for wastelanders? a single-player focused expansion? definitely not for the bullion grind I can tell you that much. in fact, that's one of the things that drove returning players away, again.
---
I hate/loathe pvp for so many reasons. There will always be 'people' who do nothing but spend most of their time in their Hoverrounds, dual wrist braces, and double fisting Hot Pockets and Mountain Dew who'll ruin games for others.
---
There're people with no poker face
---
Yeah I go to whitespring and the past few times I've gotten no legendaries. Do you have an idea for why that would be?
---
If you‚Äôre new I‚Äôll hook you up w everything and some caps to start you out
---
I‚Äôm going for a secret service unyielding armor set. After crafting over 30 armor pieces. I have 3 out of the 5 I need. 
---
I‚Äôve also been trying for a bloodied Gauss shotgun. 
---
Once that‚Äôs done. I‚Äôll try saving up for the strangler heart power armor.
---
I have a Bloodied 3 star fixer and, like many people here, I would love to be able to put skins on it.
---
Nuke them all to hell.
---
what happens if I have one?  can I tame another and have it replace to first?  or do I need to ...  'retire' ... the first one?
---
I need another type of flux but no one responded to my request. I don't have that kind either.
---
I said I was done you clearly can't seperate your feelings from facts so go back to your island
---
Free scrip. Yay
---
Yes. So many workshops these days are cleared and abandoned.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why these guys are so salty over your comment. It‚Äôs better to know more and decide what you want to do with your new options. If the OP wants to grind then no one is stopping him, but if he wants to get stuff by trading/begging/buying from people who got a bunch of ‚Äúrare‚Äù items in the future, he has the choice to do so too.
---
Did you read and accepted the Code of Conduct, you agreed with all of the points when you first joined to a server, right?
---
Dupeing is against the CoC.
---
I agree about that they should ban all cheaters, once and for all.
---
That is not a good point a lot of people are not camp builders and could not care less about camp items this sustem helps all players nit only camp builders
---
I only play it for score, caps, and adventure mode xp.
---
ALWAYS
---
WTF" join world" you crazy? that shit is hard af make it something like open game(24113\*50-235235 score) walk (12423959453409502945 score) jump (a214923559\*425\*4252454095 score) I  CAN ONLY PLAY THIS GAME 1 MIN A DAY BETHESDA THINK ABOUT EVERYONE
---
I don't know if it is confirmed but I remember hearing it on YouTube and it worked for me to get my entire set so I guess it's worth it trying? Didn't really need to downvote lol.
---
Every time I‚Äôve had my score bug, the game was shut down and I was a work. For me it never happened when logged on. The times I lost score I had really bad server lag loading in, around when game pass players started playing.
---
I also have laugh laugh on.
---
No like events
---
I was 90% sure the money in plastic barrels being buried by a dude in a lab coat was and ode to breaking bad.
---
2 people have posted that this is either against the rules or for the market. Shut up Neeeeeeerrrddds!
---
Proof that it's not.......I have the other flux mate, I can give you to HELP as the title reads. I'm on just now.
---
Bethesda is going to be releasing expeditions which by name makes us think we are leaving Appalachia. It won't be like those dlcs that have an entire new world to explore but we might be leaving Appalachia.
---
I think he meant which category of weapon it‚Äôs in, like rifles or heavy weapons...
---
See above
---
I‚Äôm not even super high level but for me I‚Äôll spend some time doing a ton of events because I feel like it and then those extra legendaries are usually enough to get me max scrip everyday for a couple weeks
---
I'm not the one acting like a child. I'm basing my observations on facts and logic whilst you are just acting out.
---
if you can pinpoint exactly what I said is wrong I'll concede to whatever you want. but so far you've done a poor job at that.
---
thank you, I was literally just telling him and even ended it nicely, I wasn't being rude about anything, but I dont really care though, i lost some more internet reddit cool points for telling a guy something? it doesn't matter none of these people have a life off of here anyway
---
Square to rank up on PS4
---
new skin on the module
---
Like maybe dungeons that take you out but come back at the end cant stay
---
Just do one match with a lvl1 alt dumb dumb
---
Nope I said I was done leave me alone your clearly getting upset over this
---
I play strange in number &amp; i need at least 1 ppl with mutation in my team. Most of new or low lvl don't have mutation. So i switch team ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yo you‚Äôre big brain ty for thjs
---
Do you happen to have the future tec skin on your camp? This is a known bug to those who have used that skin. Otherwise, could you give more info on anything that was changed around when this happened 3 days ago?
---
Do you got a picture of how it looks?
---
If you used the Future-Tec C.A.M.P. skin then that's the issue, it's bugged. People have been posting not to use it for a few days now at least. Not sure if un-equipping it resolves the issue or not, sorry.
---
... and then it's a race on who gets to the event first and one shots the legendaries.
---
I'm level 40 and I'm doing pretty good. If you have extra legendaries I'll take them but I was just wondering if it would eat up caps
---
oorah
---
No, Xbox.
---
Exactly. I think you were being rather civil in your replies. Some people just need to take a chill pill.
---
Seems like they nerfed whitesprings a while back.  It used to be full of legendaries, but now one or two is the norm.  Same for westek.  Somehow the DMV apparently got missed in the nerf.
---
I don't see why you can't reward people for hiding in a bush for 10 minutes.
---
I get a little more pissed when I start the imposter and I dont get to finish it. That's 1,700 caps damnit.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot that this bag had a bunch of serums as well.
---
if you're done then why are you still replying? that seems like a very emotional response, something you accused me of.
---
yet you're the one acting out and failing to post any actual argument.
---
Never thought about using the side stairs for my monorail CAMP. This is fantastic.
---
For me, Claim, get rewards, leave. Let someone else do the same or stay. I LOATHE pvp.
---
I'm on Xbox, and it was just left in the middle of the floor.
---
The score bugs really take away from the fun of it. I don‚Äôt enjoy grinding out 17 repeatables to make up for issues.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think I can post it here but I can dm you it
---
That's pretty sweet!
---
It did not work when I tried it
---
Actually idk if you can dm pictures
---
Why are you sad if you want people to play with I'm on xbox and we have space for lonely players
---
You spelled ‚Äúfeature‚Äù wrong.
---
I think there's a big difference between toxicity and pointing out valid flaws that this game has had and continues to have.
---
I wait until all 3 are available and do them all at once.
---
We are physically getting more items for free via the Seasons. Even if we are not getting atoms in the same amount, we are getting at least 3 times the amount of items those atoms could buy. Some of this is very high quality too.
---
Overall, I agree. You still get the occasional jerk, but most people don't mess with other players.
---
that's not an argument still. you're doubling down on what I just said.
---
The game isn‚Äôt great at explaining how to repair things without the kits when you‚Äôre starting. You have to go to the appropriate workbench, choose modify, go to inspect the item you want to fix, and then it should have the option to do a workbench repair. On the Xbox, it‚Äôs Y to inspect, and X to repair. Probably triangle and square on the PlayStation, and I couldn‚Äôt say for pc. 
---
I think I got to level 20 before figuring it out, but I‚Äôm kind of slow at that stuff. (I was on my second play through of fallout 3 when I figured out you could fix stuff yourself.)
---
Check my profile I posted it there
---
Edge detected. Why so rude?
---
can‚Äôt you just view them in-game without a website
---
Bye
---
It does not force you to do that. Getting 25000xp for repeatable to compensate for lost score is quite easy while you're doing your adventure level up challenge (or just play the game normally).
---
I understood the caps to be keeping hackers and other exploiters from being able to get unlimited amounts of currency. I think the caps should at least be raised though. I feel most of those frustrations too, I just have hope that some of these things will be addressed in future content. I look at it as the game has come a long way in terms of playability and there‚Äôs potential it can come even further. I‚Äôm just holding out for that
---
So were the atoms we got before to purchase content we wanted
---
I like Queen of the Hunt, The Blackbear Lodge one, and I usually go hunting for the Hemlock Holes cook.  I also like Heart of the Enemy and anything related to BIV.
---
Daily Challenge? Level up - More levels is always good, even if it may take a bit to do
---
Daily Quest? Cop a Squatter - best when someone else does it for me, gotta love that
---
it's become obvious at this point you have no arguments, nor can you disprove anything I said. I wonder if you ever even had any arguments at all.
---
have a good one.
---
Candem Park dailies. I like to eat those hotdogs, run like a headless chicken and toss dross.
---
I‚Äôll prep the film while running dailies later
---
The auto bot flagged more players than actually got banned, my main got flagged and was suspended for a week or so but then they actually looked at it and I got unbanned. There was probably a fair amount of false positives but for most part I‚Äôd say if you got a perma ban you duped wayyyy to much
---
If you leave the game it disappears.    
---
Depending on the location, enemies may show up and attack it. If nothing is making noise like generators or Turrets then this happens a lot less at least in my experience. Repairing it is cheap.    
---
If you think about it, your CAMP getting attacked fits into an apocalyptic world.
---
Oh dear. Whooosh straight over your head
---
My name isn't Comma, Smartass.
---
I agree with you, coming from PUBG, I was super aggressive but I had to change my play style.
---
Stop being so negative.
---
You can, but I suppose this is nice for those not able to check, like while at work
---
Again, you do not HAVE to play anything. Your FOMO just blinds you to it and makes you sound entitled. You criticize a part of the game that is FREE and aims to (minimally) reward existing NW players and incentivize non-NW players to engage with this game mode. I, for one, have never played NW before the run, and just started to play for some extra SCORE points. I did not fall in love with it, but I get a lot of fun out of 1-2 games a day. Yesterday I was in a discord channel with a NW team that all started playing NW as part of the run. The incentive works as intented in my eyes.
---
To the point though, I absolutely and unequivocally do not think it makes sense to expect that a season should require "minimal effort".  It should reward engaged players and that is that.
---
I wasn't even trying to argue and told a guy a fact about a game and 20 people, twenty! got butthurt and decided to take time out of their day to downvote a comment lmao, I dont understand some of these people but like I said its whatever
---
Dude go away you fuck boy simp I dont care what your point is anymore im blocking you. Your a fucking creep you incel peace of shit. I tried to have a civil converstation and you where like but nuh uh my feelings.
---
That's why you get a Dense mod on your chest armor or get the Fireproof perk. You can stand under an orbital strike and take no damage.
---
PRAISE BE TO MOTHMAN, BRINGER OF WISDOM, KNOWLEDGE, AND A PLUS-FIVE EXPERIENCE BONUS! PRAISE BE!!
---
I have to strongly disagree regarding the community being toxic...it‚Äôs actually extremely helpful and sincere and always willing to lend a hand on this subreddit and in game. However that being said there are a slew of bugs and broken weapons etc that do break the end game to an absurd state where it feels like you have hacks on. But never have I seen many people here hate on each other. It‚Äôs mostly criticism of the game itself and pointing out things that objectively need to be fixed. I‚Äôm assuming you might be new I could be wrong but keep looking because there are great people here!
---
Being told a bloodied bone club, faster swing speed, +1 agility was only worth a couple thousand caps was the end of my trusting only the opinions of other gamers on marketplace. That‚Äôs when I went looking for additional input.
---
I'd still rather choose what is high quality to me and what is not.
---
Yeah, I've heard it might be like the return to gnr radio dlc from the creation club in fallout 4, except you don't pay for it.
---
Must have just been a visual thing! It happens to me all the time with my bullion and scrip. It will just say I have zero!
---
I think people‚Äôs biggest issue is that CAMP building really circles around the atom shop and they don‚Äôt want to dump even more money to get something that would look cool when before they could‚Äôve just saved up their atoms for that item. I like the season but I completely understand the people who want atoms, especially because I‚Äôve gotten into camp building recently and realized it‚Äôs hard to make a cool looking camp without a lot of atom shop decor to fill the space because the base game is somewhat lacking in decorations
---
It‚Äôs not too bad on caps consumption and if you win you get a decent amount of caps from most events
---
Whoa! Nice, 30 weapons! Aaaand it's non-legendary level 25 weapons with a couple low level legendary missile launchers thrown in.
---
Discovering the ropes course and trying for hours to get to the end. It's much easier now that I have a jetpack.
---
if you never see ANYTHING positive here, you arent looking.
---
*our preciousss*
---
Wendigos are just Dragonborns on shit tons of drugs lol
---
Does the lady at teh entrance have any thoughts on that outfit?
---
There is a daily challenge that asks you to do a quest? Mistaken identity is not a Daily Quest. This does not sound right.
---
Which events I do? Well I mostly care for the ones that reward me treasury notes. 
---
From the top of my head. 
---
Swarm of suitors. Extremely easy. Takes under 2 minutes if you let the miurlurks get in the island. Then just kill the miurlurk Queen to complete the event. Instead of actually sitting there for 10 minutes or more defending it. Occasionally you‚Äôll get a legendary in there. Sometimes the queen can be a legendary. 
---
Line in the sand is great for experience. It takes a while. But I enjoy it. A lot of fighting. The scorchebeasts are usually legendary enemies there. 
---
Campfire tales. Regardless if it‚Äôs the wendigo that spawns at the end. Or the bugs and scorpions. Always a legendary there. 
---
One violent night has spawned up to 3 for me. You fight high level ghouls so you usually get a few. Plus the legendary wendigo at the end. 
---
Obviously scorched event where you fight the queen. Assuming you kill her and do your requirement of 1,000 damage. You‚Äôll get 2-3 legendary rewards. Always. 
---
Also I forgot to mention above go to west tek. Sometimes you get 3 legendary supermutants inside. Sometimes you don‚Äôt. Feel free to server hop. Although the enemies there are very hard.
---
It would be nice to have someone there still but she isnt supposed to go on her life story every other song that plays.
---
Countless NW players have abandoned the game mode altogether because it's a broken piece of poo. Says this former NW sweaty and yeah I dont want to spend $10/mo just for the option to open ports on my router so that it the game might work as intended, but it probably still won't.
---
I chose your response just on a whim, so nothing personal. Just honestly wondering why you keep playing a game that‚Äôs apparently played-out for you. You don‚Äôt seem to be alone in this, and I‚Äôm genuinely curious what the motivation is.
---
I burned out before even reaching the end game grind,  and have put the game aside as I play other games that have come out. I intend on coming back at some point, but honestly with all the games in my backlog and the constant stream of new ones coming out I certainly don‚Äôt need to come back ever.
---
What is it about f76 or other games like it where people stick around well after the point they stop having anything to do?
---
Yeah I wouldn't believe that myself... this is what I was talking about with no comments... or in your case only one very inaccurate one. Did you find anything or place that could price a little better? Feel like that person was trolling.
---
you're the one acting out. if you have no arguments then why are you still replying? why did you in the first place?
---
again, that's a very emotional response. something you accused me of. yet you're the one still replying. not to add to the discussion in any meaningful way, but just to call me names.
---
strange times indeed when someone would abandon all logic like that.
---
Glad you‚Äôve had a productive day, assbag
---
If you have Fallout 1st you can use a private server for it. Just know sometimes it can bug, but I have not had that happened yet. Go to a train station and use one of the suitcases, put the items you want to transfer in one of those. Then quickly relog to the other character and join the private server. The private server stays up for around 5 minutes iirc when no one is on. So you can use that to log on another character and get the items from the suitcase.
---
It should be made a Weekly Challenge.
---
You forgot the dragon and black powder rifle.
---
I dont think she has one
---
I like rose
---
The game shouldn't force you to make another char just because you are already a high level.
---
One guy I play with bought atoms and paid for all 100 levels the first day he could...
---
I kind of feel this way tbh, aren‚Äôt most the rewards cosmetic (and many poorly done at that)? And they‚Äôll likely be available for purchase for atoms down the road anyways.
---
It seems perfectly reasonable that not ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù including casuals should be able to finish it completely and earn all the rewards. I‚Äôm certain I won‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt play every single day, but I‚Äôve gotten a fair amount of stuff from it so I can‚Äôt complain.
---
That is fine. Countless NW players did what they wanted. And countless are still playing, as I never have to wait more than 30 seconds to get to a game of 50 odd people. Your network issues are completely unrelated to the validity of demanding that BGS give up and stop promoting their game mode.
---
I can't say I agree, but to each thier own.
---
Vital equipment. For reasons
---
It's arround 80 Minutes (4 Matches in the top 5) to level up onced on my level.
---
I completely agree.
---
My daily quest for ward. I already have the item(s) he wants. So I talk to him. Get my reward. All under 10 seconds.
---
Or worse, collect 3 bobbleheads.
---
It's not bad, if you don't mind all the downtime it takes it launch into vault 51, then wait to actually play. Then, if you're lucky you're not downed a few minutes into the match starting. I'd play it more if there wasn't so much actual downtime.
---
tbh i think everyone already knows it was only claimed for the daily
---
Sounds like you've put quite a bit of time in NW.
---
Oh ok I'll make sure to do some
---
Oh im such a broken record
---
Sugar Grove by the National Satellite Array
---
There‚Äôs also usually one at the Kiddie Corners Cabins
---
You also might have been in Grafton?
---
You still cannot tell me that things like the captain cosmos dark matter power armor are not high quality
---
Making it a Weekly would change nothing for NW only Player and it would leave more room for casual NW players.
---
You never know, maybe they‚Äôre clueless themselves, or maybe they‚Äôre hopping to your vendor looking for a steal after dropping said advice. Besides, even the most knowledgable
---
gamer with good intentions is still not available to scan marketplace 24/7 to help with price checks. Fed76 has given me additional insight and has made me caps I lost in the past because i didn‚Äôt understand builds then like I do now. It‚Äôs no fun getting taken. Fed76 has made the game more fun for me. To each their own.
---
So make sure to go dmv got it
---
That is exactly the point. If getting to level 100 in the run meant you got a game advantage then I would probably feel very differently. But this is not the case. Cosmetics are just bragging rights and do not make the game PTW. Which is exactly why I am also fine with the buying ranks with Atoms option too. Feed your FOMO with time or money, but not by "minimal effort".
---
Nah, I know Sugar Grove.  Great spot too.  This was a little building with windows upstairs, and all the typewriters were in the same room.
---
I'll check Grafton now.
---
Nuclear Winter is a great mode, I love getting killed in a split second without knowing what even hit me. It‚Äôs so much fun hiding for most of the match /s
---
Jokes aside the level up wouldn‚Äôt be that bad if the matchmaking was better + it didn‚Äôt take so much to level up. Personally I typically don‚Äôt bother with NW challenges unless it‚Äôs the easy ones like deploying camp or killing creatures
---
Abandoned bog town has a office, and then Charleston herald building has some?
---
Switch it down to medium , I also have a 1660 and run a mix of high and medium and average about 80fps
---
What is the dmv?
---
I have better luck at the DMV than whitesprings or westek.  It is all ghouls, so you get much XP.  There are nearly 60.  Boot Department B when you enter, for 5 ghouls.  Boot Department C before you leave to get 10 more, usually a legendary.  Average for me is 3 legendaries per run, but can be as many as 6.  My advice is go there, learn the building and design a pattern that you like to clear it out.  Server hop and do it all again.  Use berry  mentats, especially at first to learn where the ghouls spawn.
---
Ok gotchu
---
Huge missed opportunity to make dark matter skins for armor. Not just the one gun.
---
Using a mule helps, I can level up in one match most of the time.
---
You know, I didn't think to go over and interact with her after I got it...
---
Now I have to go in and see for myself if she has new dialogue! :D
---
It's pretty hard to imagine what you would consider "good" from a season pass if you're complaining about a few dozen skins and camp items - which is exactly the kind of thing we'd expect from a season pass in other games.
---
You don't have a coherent ask here. If you don't want to grind for these particular cosmetics, then don't? This thread comes across as whining without any semblance of a suggestion of what would turn this from "pretty bad overall" to "pretty good overall".
---
Please do
---
&gt; I even use the Giddy-up Buttercup icon.
---
Me too! When I made an alt to rank up in NW for the dailies I even named him Giddy-up Buttercup, then realize it still used my original name even for the alt. Oh well.
---
Fuck yeah!
---
This is good advice. Or the deployable turret hidden in a bush is nice. Sometimes I only pick up stuff I can drop right away.
---
I pick a location on the map and I set a destination on the other side and travel by foot looting literally everything. You would be surprised at the amount of legendary enemies you encounter by simply wandering everywhere. 
---
When I‚Äôm not doing that, I farm the queen for hours at a time
---
It is satisfying. Run and jump and make them waste more ammo, and then have nothing at all. Good laugh.
---
Where did you pull that BS from? üòÜ
---
I had no issue finding mods for ultracite armor and I personally dislike the look of t65 so I am working on strangler heart right now. I also just like the vine look because I don‚Äôt see many people with it so I will be special lol
---
I agree and share the feeling about someone possibly lowballing the value only to try to get it from you for cheap. There's never any certainty about the prices but it definitely help give guidance.
---
I keep having that issue too lol glad it isn't just me!
---
if you think they will give up the single reason why you would subscribe to fallout 1st and give them monthly money then you're out of your mind
---
Yah I‚Äôm in the same position as you
---
Didnt downvote you bud, I'll give you an up vote incase its true just know that didnt really work with weapons for me
---
Given boiling water is functionally free xp and you need a stack for later crafting I‚Äôm surprised they don‚Äôt have a intant fog effect fromthe literal gallons of water being flash boiled away to make boiled water and then turned into gallons of teas and juices
---
I don‚Äôt care about finishing it, no. I came in late and at this point I‚Äôll be happy if I get the spaceship camp item.
---
The repair kits are still useful for emergency use when your gun or armor break in the middle or some dungeon/event.  Otherwise, still best to use the benches
---
You're right about the explosive part. It works but is prob lower on the list of weapons
---
Bring back survival mode!!
---
Sarcasm or not them being 'easy' is fine. We all don't have the same skills and many like me have some mobility issues so what's 'easy' for some isn't.
---
Level 78, Sir. It takes arround 3500 XP for my next level.
---
I‚Äôve done this with a tse handmade ü§ß
---
The negative vastly outweighs the positive
---
I just logged in and most of my daily challenges were done.
---
I lost 3500 SCORE
---
I am using the new skin. But why would that stop my camp ally from showing up in my camp? Have removed the new skin and going to restart the game and hope that fixes my camp showing on map.
---
Congrats
---
I got one too and didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal.  Luckily i still have it.... doesn‚Äôt really look good though
---
We used to have the fast travel mat during Beta but they removed it from normal camps sadly. Only workshops get to have those now.
---
Thank you :D
---
Thanks man! I didn't mean that you downvoted it was more directed to the other ones who did. Anyways what I basically meant comes down to what the other guy was saying that a server "favors" certain prefixes.
---
That's hilarious. I want that backpack now solely for that reason
---
I‚Äôve never heard of someone actually getting it from workshops. It‚Äôs an expensive plan.
---
I am Overseer rank 466. It takes a couple days on consistent playing to rank up. Pretty much impossible to get it done in a day for me.
---
I've definitely taken pictures for kills at 100s, and typically update the Vault ID photo too. :D
---
Probably abandoned bog town. Biggest building there. Got to go all the way to the roof and drop down.
---
I maintain my position.
---
I think the issue you are seeing is twofold:
---
- Fans for a live service game will always want improvement regardless if a game is polished or not. However nobody truly believes Fallout 76 is polished, its more they enjoy the game and suggests changes on here to try improve it. Sometimes people also  have the wrong idea over misinformation, you have no idea how often I told people power armour skins don't improve your stats and the 2 weapons sold had the same stats the assaultron head and combat knife in essence.
---
- Even before Fallout 76 was announced to be official. A hate train emerged, they hated Fallout and Bethesda over the idea of a online Fallout. When they game was announced the hate train was very large. The beta turned out to be more a early access instead if a beta and was released well before it should of. All of that has in turn created a undying hate train with many people loving trying to ruin the game for others however they can. YouTube's and even news outlets happy share incorrect or flat out lie because the games actual issues were  game broking but not Bethesda destroying. Skipping all the food the hate train got (Fallout 1st, ban waves and so on) they have always bullied and tried to ruin this game more for people. They are all over this sub reddit and over forms and they are not hard to find in the game. 
---
So in short haters hating along with the fan base annoyed about how this has been handled has lead to a overall toxic environment. Nothing too different to other games just with a massive hate train.
---
Edit - Thank you whoever give me the silver medal :)
---
Good job fellow wastelander
---
Np I wish that was true I remember I wasted 60 modules for a rubbish 1 star bloody gauss shotgun. Dont have the heart to try and upgrade my unyielding to ss
---
Too literally quote your original post "I never see anything positive here"
---
Ever heard of the phrase "stick to your guns"?
---
It is a location in Charleston.  It is the Department of Motor Vehicles.  
---
The building with a gold dome on top.
---
Be ready.  It is a pretty tough location for lower levels.
---
Thank you, courier!
---
Maybe I can get those jeans
---
Great point. I agree with this!
---
Hmmmm... what I'm getting from Google is links to year old reddit posts that say it's 10k at various or a very rare workshop reward. Hate to think I can't trust year old reddit posts. Mayne I should be grinding caps rather than workshops.
---
I'm level 40 so should I be fine?
---
I farm cargobots easy and lunch nukes in twenty minutes if you ever need help
---
As other folks have said, for leveling up and increasing your overseer rank, create a level 0 alt. The automatic level 2 in the fault does not count for this challenge. So just make your way outside and do the Wayward and Overseer camp quests. Boom you‚Äôre level 3 and the level up challenge is done.
---
Take that same character and go into NW. Don‚Äôt fight anything! The game rewards you for staying alive. Hide until the ring of Fire closes, move then find a new hiding spot. Rinse and repeat until you die. Boom your overseer rank goes up one and your daily challenge is complete.
---
This is the quickest way to complete these challenges if you don‚Äôt want to do any xp stacking or be bothered with doing extra stuff.
---
Delete that character. Make a new one if you get those challenges again the next day. Be proud of yourself for being so clever! 
---
I have no interest of being ‚Äúforced‚Äù to level up in adventure or NW as my max toon is 759 and 95 NW.
---
I‚Äôve always enjoyed fallout though.
---
iPresentInterval=0 in Fallout76Prefs.ini unlocks the frame rate.
---
Helping out Beckett find those weapon caches.
---
People ain‚Äôt doing her right maybe?
---
A group I‚Äôm in who run 3 SBQ and then SS before server hoping never have a issue with her and we run this every night.
---
Contrary to what everyone else is saying, events are actually not very good for getting legendaries.
---
Uranium Fever? I didn't even know that spawned legendaries; for me it's only ever spawned regular mole miners. One Violent Night? Legendary gets one-shotted every time before I even get to see it. Same thing with Riding Shotgun, ...and Campfire Tales, and Free Range, and the list goes on and on.
---
If you have access to private servers, then go for gold. But don't bother with events on public servers, it's a waste of time.
---
A much better way of farming legendaries is to go to locations where there's a high chance of legendary spawns. Some of these locations have been mentioned already in other comments on this post, but I'd personally like to suggest the fissure sites. These spawn a new SB every 10 minutes or so (you don't even have to leave the area, you can just sit there if you want), and the SBs have a very high chance of being legendary.
---
Because it's purely a mechanical limitation to force you to go out and grind some more.
---
I'd say you're barely OK.  Sneak Melee is probably best for you.
---
I literally just met her for the first time yesterday, hadnt been back there since wastelanders
---
Much appreciated, if you could just give me a tip on how to kill these fuckers more quickly? I know that I need to target their thrusters but that still take a while for me
---
Do you have a method for taking them down?
---
NW is just so mediocre as a Battle royale, it's just pure pain to be forced to play this game mode.
---
Beyond applying the new skin, nothing was changed.
---
Great minds think alike.
---
Already equipped lol
---
Is it the Capitol building? I searched it up and that's what I found
---
I got a complete set of Vanguards SS armor in less than 30 tries.
---
You can, certainly, but I personally like checking before I go in the game so I can already formulate what sort of approach I want to take to getting them done, whether I want to start in a private or public server, etc. And as been's stated, some people who are working when the server resets might appreciate it. Not terribly useful knowledge for everyone, I'm sure, but I like having it on-hand and evidently it's desired enough that someone made a website for it! :)
---
Of course they are. Yet here you are telling me off. Ironic.
---
Yeah the chances to get the specific items you want are so low that getting them without trading is almost impossible. Sadly enough you are unable to trade the gold bullion items, so it all comes down to spending enough scrip on modules.
---
To each their own but there are plenty of people that prefer to play the game as intended. A satisfaction you get from grinding and "earning" a reward you can't get from buying, glitching, exploiting.
---
I only recent completed my dirty Mr fuzzy, and I'm close to hitting my BOS elder paint (which I will grind for spares as I did the others). Even though I have so many caps I'm dumping them on the ground, I would never buy/glitch a shortcut and rob myself the "thrill of the chase".
---
Yes, the DMV is part of the capital building.  You use the entrance that says DMV.  The computer inside on the desk is what you will use to boot the departments.  Do B, then run the entire building, then Do C.
---
You sound like the kind of player that enjoys taking just the fusion cores out of power armor suits and leaving the rest behind
---
They are kinda outliers. Technically, they are strongest, but unless you carry ten of those to swap out via quickselect after every shot, it‚Äôs just unviable :P
---
Oh ok gotchu. How many legendary enemys?
---
I've seen numerous sources mathing it out saying it's less, plus this new system only rewards enough atoms for you to skip about 10 level, eating any atoms up for those who dont play everyday. Lastly, your earning score which unlocks some atoms store items, but these items would have been sold in bundles.
---
EX. PA paint, same but for different types of PA, that would be one atom store purchase, which you could wait for it to go on sale. You lose these advantages as well.
---
all gone. terrible
---
I'm a bloodied build but went full health to activate pylons, but everytime I claimed a pylon I'd get melted. Everyone was claiming pylons, but it seemed that nobody was able to get a hit in, either dead or overwhelmed by adds. There was 10+ people
---
Would love that. Land at the fire and walk straight in, done in five minutes, 4.5 of which were the loading screens
---
The lifetime challenges are one off challenges. So once you've done them, you'll no longer get any atoms from them.
---
For many long term players, this has already happened.
---
The old daily/weekly system let you earn an additional 650 atoms a week.
---
The legendary run which has replaced this allows you to earn 1500 every 10 weeks.
---
Both require the same amount of playing. The legendary run gives a load of "free" extras, but the value of those depends on if you actually want them.
---
If you cant see the difference between 6500 in 10 weeks, and 1500 in 10 weeks then I dont really know how to explain it clearer.
---
And that's why we get atoms along the way to spend personally choosing items.
---
I haven‚Äôt done the squatter one in months, yet someone has always managed to do it for me about once a week or so.  Love the random 8 script.
---
Forgot about that one, thanks! Plus it boosts the egghead mutation üòä
---
Yea I totally agree 
---
I‚Äôm hoping that they use the beta they gather from season one and improve it on season 2. They would see a bunch of ppl creating lvl1 just for those dailies or ignore them lol
---
It‚Äôs under the daily tab, and despite it only being able to be completed once, it counts. In case there‚Äôs confusion on what I mean, it‚Äôs the one in Camden park.
---
Jangles Backpack is the one thing I‚Äôve been grinding for. I love Jangles
---
I should point out though, in game people around 70% of the time are very friendly. Often giving ammo, plans, weapons and so on to low levels. Reddit in general is a lot more toxic than people playing the game.
---
Atoms are shared, skins are shared. Perk cards, gold, caps are.not.
---
Then my stuff must be bugged also dont use long term player with me boy I'm over 3k hour
---
I just played 1 match with a character that has never done NW and did it in 1 game with no kills so it's not hard. Just dont do the NW challenges, other people enjoy the game mode and they shouldn't remove easy challenges that people can do just because your unwilling to play the mode.
---
Ding ding ding.  Thanks very much.
---
I do play semi automatic only too, that's the reason, why i miss the .308 receiver.   
---
My main gun is an AAE combat rifle and another TS33 one, both semi auto, they are good enough for my needs.
---
That's it.  Thanks.
---
Haha no- although some may be prejudice against the knicks :)as a non knicks fan here I had to get over it, but eventually forgave him for being a fan. kidding - I‚Äôm still not over it ;)
---
Abandoned Bog Town!  Drop into the top floor of the tallest building through the elevator shaft on the roof.
---
Telling you off? Disagreeing with someone is not telling them off....
---
This is clever. I've just been putting up signs saying "free materials" next to the unlocked extractors, but I like this better.
---
I've gotten it twice, both times from Abandoned Bog Town... Don't know of it's more common from that one or it's just RNG chicanery.
---
Fair enough. Kinda lame, but at least it‚Äôs not limited time rewards stuff so you don‚Äôt have to play on every account. 
---
Does that mean you can‚Äôt earn atoms twice?
---
We have several options for that type of stairs. Some are half ok. But there are no other options for the stairs with poles. Why? My house has that set of stairs and I hate that everything likes neat except for those rusty ugly things.
---
They mostly appear during the free weekend. During that time they are everywhere, believe me. They level up accounts quickly and sell them.
---
Really solid work.  You're right to be proud.
---
For anyone learning how to build in FO76, take note: build small, decorate heavily.
---
If you haven't used all your character slots, makes a new character and hide till only 10 players are left. Annoying to do, having to hide for 20mins. But a lot faster.
---
You do know how to read right? I never said anything about not promoting it.
---
A gift of stims would be appropriate in this situation
---
My two favorites are in FO4. The "Prosit" bar (reference to "Cheers") in Boston and on the roof the disposal site with the scene from "Blade Runner."
---
You got signs and letters plan? Or just the small letters plan?
---
What exactly are you disagreeing with?
---
It seems like when the server is laggy she‚Äôs nearly unstoppable.
---
Make a new character = takes 30 sec to level up
---
This happens to me so much üòÇ
---
I do, and despite of that I tried to address your comment, unrelated at is may be. No sure what your point is now.
---
I always forget about that workshop/town.
---
I‚Äôll put it as simple as possible. 
---
For starters. You can only get a mutation if you do not have the ‚Äústarched genes level 2‚Äù perk card equipped . That card makes it so when you have it equipped you will not get any new mutations. And if you take a radaway or use the decontamination shower it will not take your mutations away. 
---
So play around with it. Equip the card when you want to permanently keep your mutations. 
---
Take it out when you want to get rid of them. Unfortunately there is no way to chose which mutation you want to get rid of. Each radaway will take one random mutation. It could be your fav one. Or the one you hate and don‚Äôt need. So keep that in mind. 
---
Once you get a mutation. Whatever it is. Whether you wanted it or not. You CAN‚ÄôT get another mutation in the same server UNLESS you wait an hour. It will not give you another mutation no matter how many times you try. (The exception being you take a mutation serum) but the free way to get mutations will not work on the same server. You need to go to a different world. And then you‚Äôll be able to get a mutation no problem. Once you get that mutation. Switch to another server. 
---
I was able to get all mutations under 15 minutes when I did this a long time ago. 
---
If you have the caps. I suggest you buy the serum from other players. That way you get all the mutations you want. Instead of getting stuck with crappy ones you don‚Äôt need. Some people sell them between 200-400 caps. Those Prices are fine.
---
I found using a character that hasn't been in Nuclear Winter before is the fastest way to get that challenge done! I actually won that match without any decent perk cards.
---
You'll get something between 2 and 4 usually.  Not sure what you'll see at your level.
---
The problem that I have is not with Fallout or its in game community, which is generally pretty great, It‚Äôs with the community here on Reddit. My least favorite part about Fallout is the people that just have so little or nothing good to say at all. It‚Äôs devs won‚Äôt even fix bugs, glitches and that. Bethesda sucks.. like I remember a time when people just played the game, and if they didn‚Äôt like it they didn‚Äôt play it.
---
Also agree!
---
In your case, that you assume personal opinions or criticisms of Bethesdas design decisions are somehow immune from critisim or counter opinion themselves.
---
Tbh I hate the gillie stuff but at least it prevents me from accidentally scripping/selling my armor. AFAIK the dark matter skin is not bugged it just doesn't apply to the fixer. Unless you mean the thunder pipe which is Fucked because that's the skin I'm looking forward to the most because it looks like a pepper mill.
---
iirc saveeverything
---
Refund all items used maybe?
---
That‚Äôs super nice- I tried to drop some stuff yesterday to this guy, but he was oblivious- I chased him around the camp - waved him over - I think he thought I was crazy. In the end no gear or aid exchanged hands unfortunately.
---
That's some manga shit right there. 
---
NICE
---
LOL thats normal.
---
Plus, you have uninstall your mods before you can play NW at all. It's just an annoying challenge all around.
---
Crippling perks, I have a BE Gatling gun that decimated them in under a minute, i sometimes farm them and sell for caps or I have a Nuking service I run but haven‚Äôt played forever
---
I don' know how you persistently crank out this absolute amazing content, but I for one am thankful for it. Since the first stuff you released you'd expect the quality to drop or fluctuate but it never does and it's all amazing and awe inspiring. 
---
Thanks for bringing something unique to the sub and community, I for one shall never get tired of your posts, and judging by the reception of the rest, neither will a lot of people. I wish there was a way to give you more recognition other than gracious appreciation, but it'll do for a start and is all I can offer :D
---
You can't. It used to be possible to do it by creating different characters and starting the game again, fresh from the vault. But they took those atoms and replaced them with purified water, stimpacks and stuff like that.
---
Not to mention that the Eagle has a side mount for its reflex optic, despite having a top rail to the upper receiver. That side mount actually overlaps the dust cover and the ejection port, if only slightly. Why they couldn't put the reflex on a riser is beyond me.
---
Sploosh‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Tried to do this challenge and got killed with no problem by try hards and just said forget it after 2 games
---
Yeah I had to buy it for about 8k caps. Was painful
---
Perhaps even dinner an some music
---
Oh that‚Äôs great to know, thank you!
---
What kind of build you run?
---
There is a similar building in Charleston, The Charleston Herald Building I think.  Has loads of typewriters.  Quite a few in the Capital Building too.
---
I hate NW... So glad I can skip it with the extra challenges
---
I know the feeling. It's the radscorpions that creep me out the most. It is why whenever I sense movement anywhere I shot first and find out what the hell it was later. Of course, I, inadvertently, wind up shooting other players as well.
---
Had this happen last night at one violent night too. Next time I'll wait a while or travel to a teammate- thanks!
---
I bought it from a vending machine last week, paid 8000 for it. It is a nice cap sink when you feel someone is about to make you reach max caps. 
---
It's not real money. Buy them and have fun making caps again.
---
Awesome. I just did it yesterday myself. Also been away for more than a year with the game.
---
This is the correct answer!  And don't forget to boost your INT with berry mentats, brain bombs, shielded casual underarmor, and a full set of unyielding!  Get that SCORE!  (and fancy loot from the basement bot later--I got both rare guns at least once turning in 30 tix)
---
I imagine it would be.
---
 [This one](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148)
---
It happens.  Nuke poachers suck.
---
You talking out of your ass saying false information trying to spark issues. You need to ask yourself that.
---
We take an 80% cut to Atom accumulation or get our purchases choices made for us (on scrap kits).
---
Haha karma go down
---
The new skin is bugged. Thats why it does not show up on your map.
---
I have tried this game out multiple times and I can never have a good time. It‚Äôs just not for me. 
---
Honestly, most Bethesda games aren‚Äôt for me. Call me crazy, but every Bethesda game has a load of bugs both at launch and post launch and I haven‚Äôt been able to enjoy their games because of it. They just always feel unpolished to me and leaving it to the community to fix the game is such a lazy solution. 
---
FO76 singlehandedly ensured I wouldn‚Äôt be touching Starfield or the new ES when it comes out. Anything running on the Creation Engine is just not worth it to me.
---
Max caps, HA! I've never been over 12k and am sitting at 5k right now. Guess I'll spend a few days gathering and selling water. Thanks.
---
I think that is because they can run it in like 8 minutes the whole thing and often times they dont realize you spent there hours trying to do so.
---
Yeah, it was my first time, too. A pox on him.
---
I like dropping them near boxes I haven't looted
---
For faster loading times and easier all around experiance an external hard drive is a good idea
---
Fully restarting your xbox (by holding power icon on console for around 10 seconds) every now and then will help
---
Yeah I'm level 40 so hopefully a few. I'll make sure to farm it
---
As someone that has enjoyed pubg mobile i feel like fallouts battle royale is okay but i dont like that theres random radiation from bieng outisde of the zone or running or something.
---
Even just 2 levels of fireproof and I'm virtually immune to explosions. I also have it shared for public teams... Share the love :)
---
because you have the escape artist perk
---
Then I might suggest a high school remedial course.
---
Too bad, because anyone can open the map, hover over your icon and see your level anyway.
---
That's what happens to me mostly too. By the time I have dropped Fixer, stims, radaways etc they usually are running very fast away.
---
Chicken coop and the fireplace is all probably. 
---
The ammo converter if it actually worked decently.
---
Quad + reduced Vats + 90% reduced weight. 
---
It only stops for reloads or when I get staggered.
---
Seems like itd be almost easier to just sprint to flatwoodd and do the 2 training courses there.  Takes you to level 4 and isnt as monotonous
---
Unable to remove skin from the camp module. I've un-equipped it form the Atom shop and tried moving my camp module. The skin remains. So I suppose I can only wait until Bethesda decides it is in their interest to fix it. Until then I get to take the long route to my own camp and am unable to get any vendor sales because of this bs.
---
I've never played a full nuclear winter match and the Rank up challenge is the easiest for me to complete. All I have to do is open a bunch of NW perk packs, then I leave without the match ever starting. Easy as pie.
---
I hate having to re-invite my friends to a team between every match
---
There should be a free way to hide your gear on trade screens without grinding or spending money.

I actually have fallout on a external ssd and I do notice a improvement,  the stash lag drives me nuts
---
As epic as it gets
---
thanks
---
thanks!
---
I asked that specific question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hviria/does_siding_with_one_faction_ruin_the_reputation/) and got a decent answer, if that helps. TL;DR; it might reduce the opposing faction's reputation by about 500 points but won't stop you progressing after the heist.
---
In the hospital for inoculation quest there's a mr jangles on a gurney with a toy alien on it's face.
---
Who in their right mind actually needs to use a Scrap kit?
---
No escape artist perk on though.
---
Yeah leveling overseer is rough; it's either 3-4 wins, or coming in top10 20-something times, or spending all day dying 10 minutes in.
---
If I log in just to do challenges, that daily alone takes up as much time or more than all the other dailies combined, for a comparatively small reward
---
(And I say this as someone who regularly plays with a squad that wins half or more of our games)
---
it could be your armor since i have one that makes me invisible whenever i crouch
---
I really like your thoughts and it would definitely add to the game and your right any new content doesn‚Äôt long enough
---
Repair stuff at workbenches until you‚Äôre able to slay the queen several times a day. Then use improved repair kits you get from killing her
---
This is so cute!! Makes me think of tiny house challenges from The Sims, lol. I especially love your 1x1 bedroom-- the stash box in a /r/Perfectfit with your bed with boxes and an alarm clock on top is especially charming. &lt;3
---
Buy them from players is the best way. 
---
The gold bullion SS armor and the gauss weapons are top tier too.
---
If you are a hardcore player then yes it‚Äôs totally worth it if you only play once or twice a week then no
---
Right.. because something happened that hasn't happened to you it must be fake.. you need a life dude
---
So does sickleman appear?
---
You don't need every daily now to complete it. I've skipped a bunch of NW challenges and missed the first two days of SCORE but I hit rank 57 yesterday. two days before we need to hit 55 to be on track based on preliminary estimates.
---
Just don't do it. I am heavily invested in Legendary Run but I refuse to fight other players EVER, so I don't play NW. I've had no problem raising SCORE and it seems like I will have no problem reaching rank 100 well before the end of the event.
---
Unless the first player is sneaking, the second player could easily see that someone was in the silo since they'd (most likely) have to fast travel there. Almost guaranteed poacher.
---
I‚Äôm someone who a) loves singleplayer, and b) relies on the combo of VATS and slow Bethesda NPCs. I‚Äôve played NW enough to get to Rank 10, and I‚Äôve maybe gotten 3 kills. I get that having VATS in a battle royale would be unfair, but I can‚Äôt be the only person that aims this poorly. I can snipe a Scorched from fifty yards but I cannot hit a dude in (arguably hideous) NW Wood Armor who‚Äôs ten feet away from me.
---
Holy crap never even thought of that.. Now to find a reliable way to convert caps into propaganda.
---
Ive been thinking the same thing my 2 shot limb damage now is taking 2 or more hits, fun while it lasted if they did fix it.
---
I have seen a player doing this and wondered why. I don't have a problem killing all ghouls on my own, but I wanted to see how this works out. So I waited ... and it didn't work. The ghouls just glitched through power armor frames.
---
Yeah idk about the rest of this sub but I can usually complete all daily challenges within a 30 minute window. All of my weekly challenges were finished yesterday. And the daily challenge to level up your character takes way longer than ranking up in NW In my opinion. Surviving for a majority of a match will take care of about 75% of your NW rank up.  
---
I feel like the more effort you put into enjoying NW the more you get out of it. Surviving longer counts more towards your rank up than kills.
---
If you target Mr handys or colonel gutsy and hit their Combat  something (cant remember the name) they go down real hard and will be targeted by other mobs. They even have a cool mini electrical explosion animation  when its been crippled. Its not to difficult to do but it requires you to locate it in vats, get out of vats and quickly into vats and fire right after. The low percentage of hitting it goes from 0% to 90% most of the time as a weird result of vats flickering on and off. Fusion cores for sentry bots, legs for assultron, arms for protectrons, and right in the eye for eyebot. Oh and never vats target the "combat somethin" on a turret like you would gutsy or handys, they are armored to all hell there.
---
Scout armor isn‚Äôt that great, you need marine armor or power armor (although power armor is very noticeable and clunky). Yes NW is hard for new players because you‚Äôre still learning where everything is, what guns you‚Äôre best with, etc. If you want to get better, you‚Äôre gonna have to play and practice. In the beginning, it‚Äôs probably better to have a perk load out more tailored to defense than offense. Like iron clad and life giver. Find teammates to play with. Even if it‚Äôs just one person, it makes all the difference to have back up. Hacker is super helpful to get aid, weapons, and reveal enemies. Revealing enemies can help you know where to go and where to avoid large groups. Drop with your teammates even if they‚Äôre just randos. I‚Äôve made friends that I play with to this day that way. If you don‚Äôt make friends or your teammates aren‚Äôt being team players, at least if you guys get attacked you have others to help fight or distract the opposing team while you fight or flight. Lastly, lvl doesn‚Äôt really mean shit sometimes. I‚Äôve been taken out by people of all lvls and I‚Äôve taken out and had low lvl teammates take out high lvl players.
---
I think it may be a bug. I had it for like a day on my account. The armor will make a small ding sound when it‚Äôs activated and it‚Äôll keep you invisible for the whole time you‚Äôre crouching and not moving. This was just a brief second of invisibility.
---
I had 9 but 5 where auto completed for a total of 3000 score.
---
You are trying to hijack a thread on the legitimacy of having NW daily challenges and try to make it about you. If that wasn't enough, you are trying to smart-ass your way back out of the conversation. It is no wonder you could figure out how to setup your router in the first place. Thanks for trying to play.
---
amen
---
Anything you find on Nexus is safe. Bethesda does not support mods, but do not restrict the use of them. Meaning, if mods breaks something it's on you and you can't get help from them. But nothing like that won't happen. Also, if they wanted to restrict them they would put in the same thing that NW has (you can't enter NW with mods).
---
You know, I'll be honest, when i play ANY competitive gameplay against other players, i get into to much "of the hype" and let my adrenaline take over, turning me into an angry competitor when i loose...but after reading that, somehow I'm feeling much better about it...huh...
---
I could use .45 if you have any
---
If you just started building, pay the 40 or so caps to pick up your CAMP and replace it.
---
I started an alt just to play with seasons (beelined int 15), but he's shredding levels and everything so fast that he's become my main.
---
I don't really understand the game mode. I've picked up shotguns, point blanked into a guy doing no damage only to be killed in 2 shots. Unload whole clip of a smg into the face of a guy chasing me, get killed by 3 or 4 shots. Get gamma shotgun at start, guy walks into room and I unload on him. Shrugs off all the damage.
---
Do you just have to suck it up till you get the right perk card combo? I just don't get it.
---
thats cool and im sure lots of people do as well. its not so much the dialogue, but the voice. mostly the over enunciation, but im also a drab pos lol.
---
That‚Äôs because you are not very bright, get it?
---
Never, 
---
I won't stop believin' that BugthesDUH still won't fix NW. 
---
I won't stop believin', hold onto that feelin'
---
Cause they're a bunch of greedy incompetent bastards!
---
Actually I think the complaints serve a purpose to point out just how much of a cluster bomb of overpaid and under capable this game studio (dies laughing) really is. They could try to fix anything in NW. I mean they did fix the explosives self-downing glitch/exploit, but we still have QS booties all over the place.
---
I usually see as much positivity as negativity here. Or at the least, constructive criticism. Though, there are still those that just mash their keyboard in anger, smash POST/COMMENT and hope it all works out in the end.
---
One thing is certain, though. At least it's not Steam forums. Yikes...
---
I just did that because on my last camp I had the same issue with a big platform
---
I fucking HATE the metal stairs and vault stairs that are my only option for adding a second floor to my house. It looks totally out of place with the nice stonework wallpaper and hardwood flooring. Why isn't the floor option that has stairs built in (like OP's picture) an option in fo76? I would even deal with making my house look like a shack just to have those stairs instead if they don't initially add them in with the atom skins.
---
Thank you for putting effort into something like this and I think you hit a lot of great notes, just some ideas were not my cup of tea. It‚Äôs definitely a new take as I‚Äôve never heard anything like this before. 
---
First, I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt want to have to share my loot with anyone. I definitely don‚Äôt want to roll for a chance to get a legendary over someone else when in the past I could have just received my own legendary and they received there‚Äôs. And I definitely don‚Äôt want others deciding if I can sell or scrap items. 
---
I like the idea of one inventory with all of the loot however, I don‚Äôt like the idea of having everyone be able to access the same inventory. If this were to be implemented it would have to be each person gets the pool of all the loot. Especially in events like radiation rumble, where I tag every enemy anyway, this would be an excellent choice of design as I would no longer have to take a half an hour to loot every ghoul corpse so that I can collect bulk scrap.
---
Thanks for all the info. I knew it already tho, my problen is after getting 3 mutations (and cleansing them) by exiting and entering the game. I could not get a new one in 10 tries. Even exiting and entering the game. I got the notification icon you get when you should get the mutation, but no mutation, same as when you don't exit and enter game.
---
I haven't equipped the perk yet ofc 
---
I would definitely buy mutations for those prices, I thought they would cost much more. I will try to search player vendors tonight. Thanks for all the info
---
Because it's not valid. You don't need to complete every single challenge to finish the season. Just skip the ones you don't want to do. If you absolutely feel like you have to do every single challenge just because it's there that's a you problem, not a game problem.
---
They could just modify some frostbite spiders from skyrim. I'm saying this because they are more tarantula like in appearance which I can definitely tolerate. What gives me the creeps are blackwidow like spiders (imagine the ticks without the blood pouch and the size of radscorpions)
---
Most high-level players already have all the event rewards, so they just join for killing ghouls as this gives a lot of XP, legendaries for scrip (if I solo this event I usually get 5-6 legendaries from this) and Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets (for the chance of getting a fancy shotgun/revolver).
---
Legendary run made me uninstall the game.
---
I'll come back when the BoS content is dropped. I've played all the actual content in the game already, the legendary run is not new content it's repackaged shit.
---
The simple fact is you cannot maintain 500 atoms a week. Under the old system you could.
---
Sure if you blow through the levels of legendary run you'll pick up 1500. But no more will be available until it resets in september.
---
You can top them up by completing lifetime challenges, but most of these are finite - once you do them, they wont be available again. So you'll run out of finite challenges, if you havent already.
---
Since you have 3000 hours+ in this game, which lifetime challenges do you have still available?
---
"haven't seen this posted", nah only like 5 times a day for a week.
---
What platform, if pc and want help, i can.
---
can do really fast, or slow to show you.
---
Take it for a month and spend most of your time filling that stash box with as much junk as possible. Get the good stuff. Steel, lead, Oil, Acid, Cloth etc
---
use this to find said junk  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) 
---
And then cancel it. Yeah. The tent will be a big miss but you can still access your scrapbox
---
Silver lining you are one more camp placement to getting that 40 atoms for place camp 76 times.
---
I've never played an MMO that actively wanted me to stop playing, as much as this game does. Inventory and Bank limits are fine and all, but the currency limits are what breaks it down. I will get to the point with my crew where I'll just say "Sorry guys, I'm full on all and can't fetch anymore. I'm gonna go watch Vinesauce. Godspeed."
---
Really shows the shortsightedness of the management team. Yeah, I'll play again the next day, but I'm not gonna be as invested in the game as I have been with other MMOs I played (and certainly won't be spending as much either, considering I cant use half the stuff I already own from the Atom Shop).
---
My quad pump has been doing amazing with. I perk canards. I know I prob scripped so many before I saw the video about them. I always hated shotguns until now . So I don‚Äôt know if it is fixed or if this is how it‚Äôs always been.
---
I like the air quotes on "complete" 
---
E.g. that guy is a "complete" jackass.
---
More like less than bronze üòí
---
No idea. Maybe other people have looked into it. Maybe it's some future DLC. Maybe it's just a bit of fun changing the wording.
---
Today I did 4k SCORE just with the repeatable weekly for level up. 183-&gt;200. Nothing important just flexing.
---
Funny, ‚Äúlevel up in NW‚Äù are the *only* NW dailies I bother with, because I can bush wookiee on a new toon for ten minutes or so to complete the challenge. Today‚Äôs ‚Äúuse three Stimpaks in NW‚Äù? No way. I‚Äôd have to play NW to find the stims and use them.
---
Someone did a rundown before, today you "should" be hitting high-50s
---
But that was before they added all of the extra dailies.
---
So even If your behind, taking advantage of the double-weekend shouldnt leave you too far behind
---
From there is just join a builder ot event public team for an afternoon someday to grind out a handful of the repeatable
---
They will give them to us, and more... we will just need to pay 1500 atoms for a bundle containing a lot of junk we don't want.
---
The queen, disease and a couple kill ones which I swear ive done but they are shown as avalible for me
---
The quantities are extremely small. You can get the total GB payouts in 60 TNs.
---
The total Scrip let's you roll 5 or 6 3-star weapons. Woah! What a boost!
---
I dunno. Free Atom are hard to come by these days.
---
What? No... its something a lot of people will want, 1500 minimal..
---
Neither should leveling. Games boring at right now and really don't want to force a level EVERYDAY.
---
Actually I remember the reasoning given by shoddy cast? for radscorpions to be something about them being mutated emperor scorpions which is the most common scorpion pet to have in the US.
---
You may want to hold off on scorchbeasts until you level up past 50 and get some good gear. The rest of that advice is worth noting though.
---
The ones that require you set up a camp or use stimpaks take you a long time to do? Really?
---
Ok I can spare like 400 that good
---
Bruh just use another character that doesnt have any levels on NW to level up and get the score
---
Ok I'll do that
---
Thank you, I will get to modding then.
---
Don't buy the repair kits from the shop. They're honey pots.
---
You get better repair kits by showing up to Scorched Earth.
---
bro I share that perk in the main game so if my teammates go down their grenade finishes them off
---
It sucks but that‚Äôs how it goes unfortunately. If you‚Äôre on pc I could drop you some scrap to help with your repairs and help you out. Ign: Fredsux99
---
Well then I guess we don‚Äôt need it for camps. Already in the game.
---
no.
---
don't do it.
---
I know what it was! Someone on public teams sharing escape artist.  I‚Äôve never used that perk before so I didn‚Äôt know what it did. Thanks for the answer!
---
I dun remember details, but if you hard pacify it, its immune to damage. But also cant fight/ defend your camp
---
They have Whale in their username. They know what they're doing
---
She always says that right before playing "anything goes by Cole Porter.
---
Tbh I don't understand why the first full pvp gamemode they add to a Fallout game is a gamemode that heavily punishes dying. No singeplayer focused player likes that risk.
---
If anything, the next actual pvp mode should be either a standard team deathmatch or something like Block'N Load.
---
We could change the Pip-Light in FO4 under Options. On PC it can still be done manually through the Fallout76Prefs.ini.  
---
Everyone's Pip-light will be the same color as yours, though.
---
Bone Apple Tea
---
What did i spell wrong?
---
Kettle
---
Cattle is the plural of cow.
---
The game seems to prioritize scrap in your stash over your junk box. It‚Äôll take your saved items no matter if they are displayed of not. At least that‚Äôs been my experience so far.
---
We need the whole set...
---
Oh, ok
---
Bloodied currently
---
I figured it out! someone on my public team was sharing escape artist perk. Someone else told me it was the escape artist perk causing that to happen. I‚Äôve never used that perk before so I didn‚Äôt know what it did.
---
Thanks for the reply! I figured it out.
---
Welcome back, the game have aged pretty well with content. But sadly the bugs and bad performance are still a thing
---
If you're on Xbox I can run it through with you
---
"No problems with SCORE, not testing on PTS"
---
Fucking donkeys.
---
I don't know if anyone suggested it, but this is what I do. I keep an alt for NW. When that daily comes up, I find a far off spot in the map and hide. I don't engage or loot. Just hide. If I survive the storm moving once or twice, that normally gives me enough XP to rank up once. After a certain point, I just delete the alt and make a new one.
---
Whole process takes maybe 10-15 minutes.
---
Yeah I have those bugged too.
---
So since you dont appear to have any lifetime challenges left apart from the bugged ones, what did you achieve to earn 500 this week? What are you going to do to get 500 next week? And 500 the week after?
---
Sure! I'll be on in a few, gt is name.
---
Nw is plagued by being in 76, and all the glitches and bugs that come with it. Many of the gameplay ideas and concepts are actually fun, hindered by the base game it's unfortunately tied to
---
I would definitely have to destroy my house and tear my camp down to just water purifiers, generators, crafting benches, bed, and stash box to make budget for my crops if they did that.   
---
Right now 80% of my budget is tatos, corn, mutfruit, blackberries, gourds, and razorgrain. If I could add snaptail reeds in the water, and cranberries, I would trash my entire house for that. I could then make my own sugar for cranberry relish and lemonade/hard lemonade. That would be perfection, imo.
---
Appalachia is for everyone!!! Happy to have ya, friend.
---
Thank you, friend. No, I‚Äôm on PC. I‚Äôve calmed down now. Breathe.....
---
Uh ... gee tell us what you REALLY think, man.
---
It‚Äôs not a grind. The dailies can be done within minutes
---
that. is. an. AWESOME IDEA BRO!
---
I literally skip sites owned by others when its obvious once i'm onsite they took it for the daily.
---
I, my friend, will do this also!
---
Trust me, they could give out 2 assets per rank and have enough for 5 seasons from **unused content** alone. This unused content is about 5-10 GB.
---
I got one from doing bivs daily and then I just did what i normally do which is travel around kill thing and scrap them
---
I want firecracker berries! :( And toxic soot flowers
---
Did you stick around on a world your CAMP could not be placed and go scrap anywhere?
---
Though on that vein aren't Scorchbeasts basically dragons in bat form?
---
I agreed with you on this til I realized you can just make a new character and play a game or two to rank up much faster than using an existing character
---
What platform?
---
Thanks for the tips! I knew some of them and I don‚Äôt have a problem with these robots, I only have a problem with the cargobot because it flies pretty fast and far away which is why I have trouble destroying it. But I still appreciate these advices nonetheless!
---
Oh my god, are you real?  I didnt hijack shit. You seriously cant read/comprehend what anyone is saying on here. I understand you're salty and butthurt. Sorry, get over it. The game mode is a broken ass piece of shit, and myself along with HUNDREDS of players that I personally know through the game hate to play because of the glitches/bugs/exploits/hacks..... I'm happy for you that you dont experience the same issues, but even giving a bone to NW for score related purposes is insulting when BugthesDUH won't fix it, at all. Why should they encourage play, when they wont fix the problems. 
---
Again, can you read? Do you understand what's between the lines. I'm a little ashamed of the human race (and especially your parents) that this had to be stated so obviously. Again, sorry your butthurt and salty. Move on cupcake.
---
K I'll be on in a bit. I'll dm when I'm on
---
No matter how much I like a camp, I always end up back at that damn tower. I can never get it right.
---
The flip flopping with place a CAMP in NW is even weirder. It's been 1, 3, 4, and 5 so far.
---
The difference in difficulty there is zero; if you have time to place one camp, you could place ten. It's just more annoying when the number is bigger. Not more difficult.
---
Yeah, get used to it. All new content is geared towards fresh players.
---
Nope.
---
I thought the hunters were optional, unless you mean they got to the former raider first and killed him. You can still choose to lie and get the best reward.
---
My game is weird, sometimes when I launch I get around 30 fps in menus and a laggy game. I find when that happens if I restart the game, I get back into the 70s at the menu and it's fine.
---
I had a normal assaultron do that yesterday. Only laser, maybe a 1 second pause between using it again. Over and over until I killed it.
---
Was definitely new to me.
---
Ah my apologies, yeah they can be annoying, good crit hit to the engines can slow down or stop the cargobot. But its location location location with them. If there is a mountain next to it it will fly real high in the sky. I usually wait in valleys for them to swing by. West Virginia is way to hilly haha so GL
---
Same just happened to me. Bloody annoying
---
That's *strategy*, baby.
---
I usually put a mine down there too, if I have one. :)
---
I am not assuming they are  somehow immune from critisim or counter opinion . You are assuming that I am assuming they are.
---
I can't believe I'm explaining myself to you but here goes;  
---
My emphasis was on the "*Don't do it then*". The OP obviously knows they don't have to do it. No one will be like *"Oh my god, really? I don't have to do them? Really? No one is holding a Gauss Pistol against my head making me do them?"*(**\***) 
---
OP is voicing their opinion on a specific daily SCORE challenge and how they'd rather see it gone. If they wouldn't do it, then they wouldn't be here talking about it. Problem solved. But obviously the OP doesn't want to miss out on the SCORE that that specific daily SCORE challenge gives.
---
By voicing their opinion hoping that maybe there might be a change in the future. If one does not say anything, nothing will happen. 
---
So, it's not about NOT doing it. It's about wanting change. What I didn't agree with on the "*Don't do it then*." is basically that person saying "*Don't do it then and shut up about it*".  In my opinion they are totally free to say whatever they want. As are you, as am I. But the way I interpret their message was "Just don't do it and shut up about it." Well, no. The OP is allowed to share this message. "*Don't do it then*" is an obvious option and not a solution that the OP is looking for at all. Otherwise they wouldn't have posted anything about it here.
---
What I said, basically falls into the same category of what you're telling me. Tell the person who said "*Don't do it then*" that OP is allowed to say whatever they want to say regardless of what they think.
---
So technically, there is a fuzz about nothing, untill you started making a fuzz about people replying to a comment and assuming they wanted people to stop having opinions. It was never the case.
---
It's not that I think they shouldn't say it, or they are not allowed. (The "*Don't do it then*.") It's that I think it's a stupid argument. Because; referring back to (**\***). Is that blunt? Yes. But my opinion stands.
---
So to sooth your mind; no, I don't want people to shut up and refrain them from sharing their opinions, views or arguments. But that doesn't mean I should shut up about them either. As much as you want to say what you want about my opinions, views and what not. But don't assume I'm trying to silence people.
---
Because you could make T h i c c walls with the foundation's so it get removed
---
Oh well I‚Äôve never done any rep glitches and maxed mine out recently. Idk what to say.
---
The only blueprint I need is my gauss minigun üßê
---
I thought the fireman outfit could only drop from the quests Target Rich Environment and Fly Swatter??
---
Follow this. First time logging in dont play nw. Dont play at reset time which is 12 est. And dont play nw last. When u finish nw go into adventure and then quit game.
---
Power armor is worthless to a huge chunk of the player base.
---
Edit: The Ghillie skins are also bugged and terrible, otherwise I might want the leather and secret service ones.
---
Nice.
---
they should return daily and weekly challenges that contains atoms as well
---
I'm on Ps4 btw
---
the events with a ! have no fast travel costs.I put my camp near a train station,so I just need to go to the event and travel back to my camp
---
I'm inspired! Can't wait to log on tonight
---
Could just y'know....make the game mode fun xD!
---
Had something similar happen today. I unloaded an auto combat rifle magazine into a guy‚Äôs head that was looting...he doesn‚Äôt move so I unload another...then he kills me, then my shots seemingly register and the guy dies at the same time as me. I‚Äôm running an Ethernet 1000MBps connection so it‚Äôs not a bad connection but it makes me wonder if the game‚Äôs architecture is even intended to support this style of gameplay.
---
Yeah her damsel in distressness tired me out, once done with the missions i switched to the wanderer(you can hide her guitar)
---
It is not true you find a lot of people usimg ot sspecially low levels
---
Agreed, they are definitely annoying to deal with. And I encountered one that flew too high in the sky today, he was high enough that it was impossible to be hit by any gun. I thought it was a bug so I just changed the server and did it again
---
From my experience, pretty much any Toxic Valley events...which includes Target Rich Environment. There‚Äôs a small chance that the rare outfits will drop at any event anywhere.
---
&gt; I never see anything positive here.
---
Then you need to open your eyes and stop clicking only on the negative posts.
---
Ok, but the question is which challenges are completing that are awarding these atoms?
---
Because you've stated you dont have any of the lifetime challenges left, so it cant be that, unless you actually have more available than what you've stated.
---
It isnt quests, as those dont grant atoms
---
It can't be daily/weekly as those dont give atoms anymore.
---
If its from the legendary run then those levels are limited - theres only 10 x 150 to be earned over a ten week period.
---
I‚Äôm like, bro, you‚Äôre literally a badass space commander you can play on your computer just fine when I‚Äôm not around.
---
That's exactly what happened to me just now, crashed on login, lost 4500 score.
---
I'd also taken all precautions known against the bug before logging out last night, so it was definately the crash that caused it. I've lost about 10k score in total now, thanks to having all my weeklies auto complete once...
---
Hide her guitar? Curious about that, could you elaborate?
---
Lol. Just don‚Äôt do it. We‚Äôre getting 9 a day with double score this weekend. We‚Äôll be fine.
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt keep her around. It‚Äôs unfortunate because her character as a concept is really interesting but her dialogue is awkward as hell. Even all the dialogue options while doing her quest were just so uncomfortable and I had to skip through.
---
And its rng if you'll even get the op damage boosting perks and basically mandatory frog legs perk. It really is very poorly designed.
---
&gt;. Im saying those that do play casually should still be given a way to catch up that isn't hardcore grinding for exp.
---
There is an option for this: Purchase levels.
---
no problem!
---
But its a good song!
---
Right?! Hahaha.
---
So i Just got the other 5 challenges i was missing but they are all completed already so ive missed out on a tonne of score. Cheers bethesda
---
It will cost JUST 1400 atoms.
---
While they‚Äôre at it, they should remove nocturnal, mutant slayers, exterminator and troubleshooter from the loot pool as well. The only legendary effects that make any sense are the ones that deal out even damage across the board.
---
You lost me at antnipples.
---
She plays really loud, but you can face the chair to a wall or aomething &amp; she won't use it
---
Thank you for taking the time to write this. I really enjoy making these images and it makes me happy to know that others enjoy them.
---
I have done that every time, NW is a trigger but not the ultimate cause.
---
Escape Artist perk. Someone shared it to you most likely.
---
Oh right on, ill give that a go, thanks!
---
Ok nice
---
[All your nuking needs](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
That‚Äôs dope
---
Play on a different character than your main.  You'll be back at low level and can get a level in round or two.
---
I agree with all of what you said except the high quality part. The ammo converter was a big flop. The camp skin removes your camp from the map. One of the gillie skins is missing an arm texture. Your vision is obstructed with some of the gillie suits in first person. The dark captain cosmos jet pack isn‚Äôt the right skin. The captain cosmos suit bundle seems to be missing the helmet. The blood eagle HM skin is missing the suppressor details. Saying it‚Äôs all high quality when one skin makes it impossible to fast travel to your camp isn‚Äôt right.
---
I thought they patched that glitch. It‚Äôs back?
---
Props to you man
---
It was the neon letters one. I've been playing since beta though, so the game has had plenty of opportunities to give it to me
---
Yeeeah, my camp is over the top of a river and the door is on the opposite side to the one players spawn on. I made a little balcony to walk around to it.
---
I don;t do anything but appreciate what you do really takes very little effort to appreciate such quality, but it's all I can offer other than imaginary internet points :D 
---
Always a pelasure to stumble across your stuff.
---
But for the people who like nuclear winter 1 overseer rank per one week would be a joke
---
Be concerned. It ain't cheap n I've heard about people being charged even after the cancelled the sub
---
Hence the reason I said SOME.
---
I want to keep my perk packs in case they revert back the legendary perk upgrading. Before the latest change the animated cards from the perk packs gave 5 times more perk coins but could also be upgraded with normal perk cards. So by opening the packs now instead of saving them you may lose perk coins. With the last change every perk card (animated or not) only gives 1 perk coin, but as the upgrade cost is insane this could change again.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can hook you up with whatever you need. Mack012166.
---
Ore? It will be under MISC.
---
They're not gone, they're just better at it. The most popular hack right now is just seeing you through walls, maybe with infinite AP and/or reduced spread.
---
Every match you play contains at least one hacker. They're not as obvious about it as they used to be but they still exist.
---
Done! xD
---
Yes!
---
"hmmm.  seems like a trap, id better move on..."
---
Gotta smelt it
---
This community's foundation is built upon mindlessly parroting things. That's how the "trade steal" hoax spread back in 2018 when it didn't exist. That's why people still think you need 200 fire rate to trigger the furious damage bug, or "magic" weapons as people like to call it. That's why people immediately said TSE is worthless after the nerf and only started realizing a year later that it still has its uses. NW cheaters are just another part of it
---
That... makes a lot of sense actually...
---
If you have the talk to rocksy then your progress has been saved and you can't do anything about it.
---
Although AFAIK that glitch has been patched months ago.
---
Definitely possible
---
Nah. If it‚Äôs working it was reported a long time before you said anything. Whether Bethesda does anything about it is another matter entirely.
---
It can be very frustrating. I can bet something similar has happened to most players at one time or another. If you are on Xbox I will help you out with some junk and repairs. 
---
GT: Superdavebjj
---
Assassins armour is very valuable though, I know we can't sell/trade secret service armour, so if you don't PvP I can see his it would be annoying but its only right that it stays in the loot pool.
---
Oh well then üòî
---
It‚Äôs the only penalty for dying in this game
---
Fair point
---
But to answer your question, if you didn‚Äôt kill him you might as well finish the quest because it won‚Äôt glitch unless you get the kill. You‚Äôll have to wait until it resets.
---
Literally no F's were given that day....
---
There can be some pretty morbid Easter eggs. Like the responder in the refrigerator in flatwoods who pleads for help to be let out revealing the location of his life savings. Only to find the stash had a gun and a holetape with plans to ensure that he would be able to leave the world on his own terms.
---
Thank
---
If you're trying the raider rep glitch. You need to kill the former raider , lying won't work with it.
---
Ah ok well the last 4 days of trying to do this were worthless then
---
So ultracite mods can be applied to strangle heart?
---
Water? Don't be a peasant. Run events like Uranium fever, sell your loot. Fifteen minutes and 1500 caps.
---
Apparently its been patched so im giving up I suppose
---
I use a bloodied auto sometimes.  It rips.
---
It's beautiful. I only find ugly ass camps, I would buy your vendors empty just for your C.A.M.P.
---
Not sure if that's what you're trying to get at, but it's a pretty good mode overall. It got really good feedback when it launched because of how well it incorporates the fallout aspects to make something unique and not just a boring clone. I've heard it described many times as a BR for people who don't like BR. But like you said, it's missing so many basic quality of life things that it really ruins the experience at times. A few simple changes like auto-queuing, an exp bar/counter in the lobby, and any kind of anti-cheat whatsoever would go a very long way
---
https://youtu.be/3QNnhw5ZOqw
---
Have you tried attaching an upper floor to it and then scrapping starting top to bottom?
---
You can cheat and look up the code, or....
---
Collect all 8 pieces. Use the keyword from the whitespring bunker for your silo and add the the front of the alphabet, removing those letters from the alphabet. Assign numbers 1-26 from your new alphabet. Take your nuke code and find the letters that correspond with the numbers. Unscramble the word. Convert back to numbers. 
---
And that is your nuke code.
---
Congratulations! Now enjoy being called a duper every time you wear it at big public events
---
Wait so it still works ?! Aight tomorrow im trying it
---
np~ If you ever see me online feel free to join my team or whatever ^^ Even in private world. Just let me know your in there cause sometimes i jump into private to transfer stuff between characters or get certain challenges out of the way quick.
---
Cool welcome mats work with workshops?
---
Was still working last night when I logged off.
---
I don't think the clean one will be an atom shop item, it's already been in the game for a while and doesn't have the atx tag. They're also pretty widespread on PC from the dev room and hacked spawns, if they wanted to sell it they would have to start actually removing cheated items and bethesda has proven many times that they are unwilling or incapable of doing that
---
What happened was I emailed Todd Howard directly. I was like Toddyboy! Now that I have a vendor that looks like it sells sweets while looking totally sweet, I‚Äôm gonna fill it full of goodies like bubblegum and Fancy Lad Cakes. 
---
And he was like, that sounds great, except don‚Äôt Fancy Lad Cakes give you rads? 
---
And I was like, no no, Toddbrah, I‚Äôm going to take over the workshop and make some that don‚Äôt give you rads! 
---
And he was like, that‚Äôs brilliant since I was already making you take over workshops even though you didn‚Äôt want to.
---
Exactly, I told him. Then I hit him with the favor. Why don‚Äôt you make it so that players need THREE bubblegum to do that challenge thingy instead of just one.
---
And TaterTodd was like, okay, but I‚Äôm also going to spawn a whole herd of aggressive ragstags near your CAMP for the lulz.
---
I laughed and left the chat. And that‚Äôs why we have to eat more bubblegum.
---
Some are amazing while others are surprisingly NOT expected. The raider cage and tree is SOOO BIG(in an amazingly good way), while the chicken coop was barely noticeable(much smaller than I expected) when I saw it in another camp. 
---
The clean sink was a nice addition, that allowed me to move off the water, but still have to risk disease by drinking and then spamming collect to avoid the agonizingly slow animation, but I guess it is better than the pump and gold grind for the well.
---
I still haven't seen the firefly jar lamp and the fireplace door in the fo76 wild...but crossing my fingers that I will be pleasantly surprised.
---
Nvmd it can't be cancel on Bethesda.net if you buy it on ps4. I had to cancel it by turning of auto renew :D
---
I'm not even halfway, I get what I get, and thats it. Cant get FOMO if you already have IDGAF
---
Go to the corner and think about what you‚Äôve done.
---
On PS4 it shows an option for me when I go to the legendary run board. The option is called rank up. Hit whatever corresponding button and it should open up the misleading stuff which is it shows you the final proboards but that's not what your unlocking with your 150. So long story short go to the legendary run board click on rank up then confirm that purchase.
---
The only thing I care about is keeping the waves going and that means keeping the NPCs alive. And you're also assuming that we care enough to figure out how these events work. When you're getting the repeatable to hit multiple times in one event, that's all most people will care about in the world after The Legendary Run.
---
Thanks for the info, but it is entirely unclear. There is no guaranteed foreseeable course of action for anything that's been datamined. We're still waiting on things from the very first datamine.
---
I did the same back then. I even played then. But still. The better system is to let the people scrip all and limit the amount you can trade in like the gold boullion system. Why not make the life easier. Many core gamers which are playing for a long time and i know myself use mules. So less muling = more fun
---
Hard pacify??
---
Dont need it to defend the camp as stuff only ever spawns there while I'm at the camp, just a matter bn of them killing the pet before I can get there.
---
Please!!
---
I will make a final attempt to address your comments. Firstly, this is a thread were OP criticizes NW challenges as part of the Legendary Run. My response was that it is BGS prerogative to cater to the current NW player base and promote NW for new players by giving them incentives to play this game mode. Then you jump in saying that NW is crap. While tangential and highly personal, I answer to you, defending my point, that even if you no longer like the game mode, it is both still popular and your opinion of it does not negate the creator's right to support and promote it. Then it all went hazy with you trying to insult my literacy. Your latest comment, where you even try to insult by family and upbringing, just screams saltiness and projection. If you are going to assert that someone is salty and butthurt, the least you can do is to express yourself in a calm and coherent manner. To conclude, your failed attempt at an argument removes any shadow of a doubt to me, or anyone with half a brain, that a constructive or even merely intelligent dialog can be achieved with someone like you. On a positive note, you can probably only get better from this point (I hope).
---
Are they still being duped?
---
I sell them pretty regularly for 76 caps a piece, which I thought was a total rip off on my customers
---
There should also be skins imo rather than just paints.
---
3000a, 3000MKIV, the original 2000, handheld devices, Pip-Pads. They could tho whatever they wanted, a lot of people would buy them. I don't understand why Bethesda doesn't learn from the mods their community creates. Surely they can extract a lot of data about what people like and don't like by looking at Nexus stats and they even host mods on their own site, which should make data gathering extremely easy.
---
bro quit crying, people can critique this shit game
---
I‚Äôd much prefer FO4‚Äôs building mechanics than FO76‚Äôs. You could do so much more
---
\[Fuzzy Brenda loved that.\]
---
This should explain it. 
---
https://gamestoday.info/pc/fallout/the-comprehensive-creature-animal-taming-guide/
---
I'm ticked that you can explore all of the map, uncover all the secrets of the universe, but you can't ask the Overseer, "hey, what's the deal with these other vaults? You know what's in them, or how to get in?"
---
Events and player vendors.
---
I know. Then people say that's a good PvP mode. PvP is about showing you know how to make a build, and how good your weapons are. Nuclear Winter is just, "Take this weapon and don't worry about builds because it does stupid amounts of damage anyways." NW sucks.
---
Yeah. Lore-wise, strangler heart is literally just ultracite that‚Äôs overrun with strangler vines. I am trying to get it because it has a poison area effect
---
Fuck the bullshit, just let me browse the vendor inventory from the damn map.  I'm tired of trying to guess who's a low-level mule or a high-level troll.
---
Shame isn't insult. Your parents failed attempt at raising a competent human was an insult to the rest of us. Buh bye
---
Start a new character and play a game
---
ah yes well shared perks made me question myself ever since public teams are a thing üòÇ
---
Hearing the mayor of Grafton on his radio broadcast and thinking I love him so much.
---
well no dupes are currently out, and yeah people will pay them up to 100c a piece, that used to be my steady income. but the reason is that there is a lot of people will literally hundreds of thousands that forget they have them or they dont care to give them to people, see any high levels and ask them for fuzzy tokens you have like a 10% chance of getting a couple thousand for free
---
It's not an easter egg really, but I love the set pieces in this game and it took me hours to realize that the bones on the pool table at the Crater core are actually set up like a game of pool. The balls, a cue ball and 2 cues.
---
https://i.gyazo.com/5180a23eb6271e1faaf4388647ec4d33.jpg
---
I‚Äôm not a very well equipped level 180 and that cave will still destroy me if I go in without some tactics.
---
You still get the cards and gum whether you open them now or later, each pack has 1 "gold" card, 4 regular cards and a stick of gum.  Perk packs were never traded in, its just the cards in them so you won't lose anything even if they revert back.  I don't think they'll revert it, they will most likely just add perk coins as rewards for other things.
---
Yes, completely agree with what you said. They rely too much on the community to fix the games for them. Heck they even tried charging you for mods on console through their stupid mod store if I remember correctly. It's been a while since I've touched skyrim remastered to put mods on, but I coulda sworn you could pay for some mods.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôll sell you the plan for 1k caps.
---
It's a free item so Bethesda doesn't care.
---
Really? You'd totally be my hero. PSN: Twiztidjuggalo73
---
Mack012166
---
The giant ticks kind of fit that mold.
---
just make a low level character for that
---
less than what the game recommends
---
Farming run 
---
Capitol-white spring- westek-etc etc.   hit those places and start again.  I have tonnes of guns.
---
Well.... it‚Äôs better now than it used to be, especially at launch.   I actually read this sub daily, and find it fairly neutral to positive, without being too circle-jerky most of the time.
---
There have been times in the past when I had to forget it for a while, usually after BGS screwed something up royally or released a major update.  Wastelanders brought in the haters for a few weeks, for example.
---
I wish you showed the same vigor you have for insulting people, in building an actual argument. You would definitely be taken more seriously. I hope you only conduct yourself like this online and not in real life.
---
Well yeah but how much
---
Did the tokens for the Mine Kittery also get duped? I‚Äôm saving those up myself for the disappointment of turning them in at the highest level.
---
That cuts my grind in half, thank you very much.
---
I'm guessing that the OP was sneaking most of the time, taking it slow, but I've gone to a silo before and started my run to hear someone else was already there (explosions etc), I just left them to it.
---
atom shop paint
---
My boyfriend and I just started making mule characters for this challenge. Two half assed games should level up a level 1 toon. Just make sure you redeem any gold, scrip, lunchboxes, etc. from the legendary board on your main character and not the mule.
---
You‚Äôre welcome. If this game is going to survive we as a community need to do our best to help each other whenever we can.
---
Be nice if they fixed adrenaline
---
Agreed. üëç
---
I haven't seen any be duped but everything in this game always gets duped, if anyone has something they'll dupe it. but even if, I doubt it was anywhere even remotely close to mr fuzzy tokens. I think you're fine
---
From what I've heard and been told they do however I've never kept a workshop long enough to have a need for them.
---
I heard the new pet might fight the old pet who becomes wild.
---
It didn‚Äôt work now I just have an extra floor attached, thanks anyways
---
And it works on Mirelurk Kings and the Scorched Beast Queen.
---
Totally agree on that.
---
Sell slower.  If you are clicking really fast it can sell stuff from other tabs for some reason.
---
I liked her too. Way, WAY better than Travis in FO4, wish you could meet her like in Fallout 3, but she's got nothing on Mr. New Vegas. That guy new how to give news reports AND DJ. I guess Beth may not know how to script that in a multiplayer setting.
---
How can you have 1350 Atoms at rank 44?
---
There's 2000 in total and the last 500 are on rank 100.
---
Nice, I have seen some similar types of interactions with mob infighting.  Seems like maybe more so these days.  Maybe with Wastelanders update?
---
Nice! That near Twin Lakes? I used to have a camp near there. I was routinely visited by Scorchbeasts and vertabots, and I know a Behemoth spawns out there too, so this probably happens more than you would think.
---
First time ive heard it referred to as the welcome bear. I love it
---
I always have mad respect for people that focus there builds around pre existing structures. That's where I exclusively build.
---
I rarely sell individually, mostly its bulked. The recommended vendor price is halved and then rounded down to the nearest 0 or 5.
---
Eg if it says 88 &gt; 44 &gt; 40
---
I keep 2x bundled of each scrap type and vendor the rest, and its a very healthy seller.
---
The Yao Gui is normally away from the spawn point.  It paces between the front door and the car. Something probably pulled it out of position.
---
The bubblegim is a great idea, I was looking at Challenges a couple days ago &amp; noticed that eating bubblegum was also a daily challenge for 500 SCORE. üëç
---
Personally, I do between 25-50% of the games recommended price for crafting components and other things some people regularly need but that I accumulate a lot of. This helps everyone out, as they get their crafting components for cheap, I get more room in my stash and make quite a few caps too. Selling large quantities of things prices for 5 c or so quickly adds up. For things that are semi-rare but I still don‚Äôt need, I‚Äôll go 50-75% of the games price; only the rarest items get full price in my vendors, and those still go quickly because I‚Äôm guessing some people mark them up a ways too. IMO it just depends if you‚Äôre trying to clear stash space or make caps first. I value a clean stash over excess caps, to each their own!
---
So much yes! I loved the wood stairs you could use in 4. Used them just about everywhere.
---
I agree. Leveling up in both adventure Mode and NW shouldn't be daily challenges.
---
Lunchboxes.  I just love opening them, lol.   Or just that emote or something
---
Buttressed, and for sneaking if it isn‚Äôt bugged, the one that makes you more sneaky. Also Jetpack is life!
---
I may have received additional atoms from lifetime challenges.
---
How about stairs that don't leave a huge gap for you to fall through? That'd be nice.
---
I love running around and placing Porta potties in a random spot and just waiting in it with no items. I'll pop into photomode and just people watch as the circle closes.
---
It's even more fun with friends. We made a blueprint of three Porta potties in a row and each hid in one. The sheer adrenaline we got when someone came up to the doors was just great. We routinely make it to the top ~4 teams that way as well.
---
Sigh, I do Forbidden Knowledge enough times that I just finally got the BOS Officer paint, I could add this to the daily chores
---
They're doubling down on it by making you pay coins to respec. Isn't the whole point of the perk card system ***respecing on the fly?***
---
I don't mind the NW challenges, the ones i absolutely hate are the ones where you have to find things, like chew x number of gum. You can't make gum so you have to search for it and it just never seems to spawn when I need it so i end up trying to farm that stuff for ages. Not fun, not even a grind just annoying
---
When did you take those shots? First Age or Second?!
---
Gillie suit, camera mode, prone, you'll rank up because you'll be the last alive
---
Just playing the game and it seems to rain legendries on me, not really trying, I scrip to the max 150 and sell the rest to make up the 1400 cap daily allowence. Rinse and repeat.
---
How did you stack the metal mesh 2 x 1 stairs?? (Looks great btw)
---
You can buy a plan for greek columns at Whitesprings Resort. It's the vendor at the end of the hall that sells all Whitesprings plans, Pendleton?
---
Yes. If you roll a card you have every rank of, it gets deleted. They're not interested in retroactively restoring lost perks.
---
I've lost about 300 myself.
---
No problem here
---
but of course, along with the casual i have the 3 older ones before shielded, neither have dropped, just some really BS RNG.
---
been running queen of the hunt and any event in the savage divide to try get both for so long now im practically a regular at those events :(
---
K
---
Ya, opening your pipboy and laying down a camp takes hours.
---
Probably that grilled brahmin steak in OPs pocket.
---
Is that faster than just going into Wayward, accepting the quest, then going to the Overseer camp across the street? It's a guaranteed level up.
---
I just want everyone to know that my heritage is from this part of the country. And I am outraged by this post. I have it on good authority that my great-grandparents at least bought those people dinner first.
---
Admittedly, those ones go relatively quickly.
---
However, those are probably the fastest ones that you can do, and when you compare those to the fastest challenges that you can do in Adventure mode, even the ‚Äúuse # stimpaks‚Äù challenge can take slightly longer than the ‚Äúpurchase/sell 3 items from/to players‚Äù challenge. Of course, when we‚Äôre talking about challenges that don‚Äôt even take that long to do on the first place, the difference isn‚Äôt all that prominent.
---
However, to compare some of the most time consuming daily challenges in Adventure mode and Nuclear Winter, namely the ‚ÄúIncrease Overseer Rank‚Äù challenge from Nuclear Winter and the ‚ÄúLevel Up‚Äù challenge from Adventure, it generally takes significantly longer (for me, at least; my skill level certainly plays a factor in how long it takes, but that can also show shows how tedious a challenge like this can be for someone who doesn‚Äôt play many battle royale games) to increase my Overseer rank than it does to just level up once in Adventure.
---
But yeah, the ‚ÄúLol just put down your C.A.M.P. once‚Äù challenge does tend to go by pretty quickly (not that I‚Äôm complaining, just in case the omniscient Todd Howard is hearing every word that I‚Äôm typing out right now).
---
The Riding Shotgun event has a guaranteed legendary enemy spawn and I usually see 1-3 random legendary spawns while running the event
---
I love the items. I love power armors and the AO themed skins are awesome, raider tree is nice, weapon skins are decent, Cosmos PA are beautiful. And the filler rewards are ok, i don't feel like i work my ass off doing weeklies or dailies. Most of the time i just do events and i tend to complete a couple objectives right off the bat. I also have a couple atoms stashed away for a rainy day, so if i ever fall behind with the levels, i can just buy them with atoms.
---
Overall i'm satisfied, but i'm not pouring money into the game, don't have Fallout 1 and i will never get it, it just seems expensive for the yield you get from it.
---
Only thing is you don't get the 2 treasury certs if you let the mirelurk queen spawn.
---
It is also a lot of fun!
---
You can chamber combat rifles, Fixers in .38, which is what I use when I don't need my handmades.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs weird and laggy. This game is very unfriendly to button mashers. I‚Äôd bet that 90% of ‚ÄúItem ‚ÄòX‚Äô disappeared from my inventory‚Äù posts are the result of this.
---
Why can‚Äôt we also have INTERIOR WALLS
---
Salty. Imagine getting bored of playing the same content that has been buggy, boring and broken since launch.
---
That's the action I'm going to be taking myself from now on. Just saying, sure would be nice if Bethesda implemented this.
---
All these posts basically boil down to the OP trying to say they dont want NW challenges and would rather it be replaced with adventure mode.  Honestly, I love that NW matches are now faster to find now because of all the people.  You'd be lucky to get more than 25 people in a match before Wastelanders dropped and now I constantly see full or almost full matches.
---
Oh ok. I'll be on in like 20 minutes so I can give you them then
---
And booze, boiled water, and Nuka cola üòâ
---
Oh yeah! Rib eye is the bomb!
---
Have they made one for Marine Armor besides the later one you get in the legendary run? If not, I'm just gonna have to sell at a snail's pace for a while which works for me.
---
This is the reason some people try their best to exploit with every chance they get, the RNG is just too frustrating for the normal player. While some exploit to get godrolls for themselves some sell them to frustrated players that don#t want to grind anymore.
---
The SS items even probably boosted this drive to exploit as you can't even trade them legitimately between players anymore and would be 'forced' to grind for your dream roll yourself without the chance to exchange your roll for your dream weapon with somebody else.
---
I would love to join. Got 16 nuke cards and play every night
---
Pretty much me, the only NW challenge I've done so far is "place a camp"
---
Gt?
---
I always try to sell from the middle (not the top or bottom item). I've sold things in other tabs while spamming and don't thinks it's happened since I started doing that.
---
Guess it wasn't me then lol
---
I don't like it either but I'm 18 on NW and it's 3 wins to rank, or 5 losses if you make it into the top 5 players each time. 
---
Honestly just hide in a bush with the ghillie suit costume and move when the ring shrinks. The system doesn't reward based on performance just on survival. So it'll give you higher XP just making it into top 5.
---
I've rolled 3 SS a day for the past two weeks. Not a single uny. I feel your pain.
---
Not really. An MMO has to keep bringing in cash somehow. Either by subscription or real money store. Is it unfortunate that this one has chosen both? Probably.
---
This was actually just after release! 
---
Maybe "a while ago" was a bit of an understatement haha...
---
Nice! It still hurts me claiming a workshop for the benefits with my L.30... why oh why would anyone challenge me.. who would hit on a rookie? Well, many do..
---
They have baseline stuff.
---
We've only seen about 2-5% of the total challenges in the .esm since BETA.
---
There are so many and they don't use any of them.
---
Being aggressive is good.  The map is much smaller than PUBG, so the time it takes to get to a certain area on the map at round start isn't too significant.  If you can get a halfway decent weapon at the start, rushing an enemy team can frequently work out in your favor since the stimpack/armor/weapons still still be in relatively short supply.  Once the enemy team is neutralized, then you can continue to loot out the location.

With the lack of any type of text based messaging system on FO76 I truly appreciate the unique ways people come up with to communicate and leave messages for fellow players.
---
What's sad is that the expected normal state of the shotgun is that it can't kill anything. That we consider that uselessness "fixed"
---
I've accepted I don't have the time, bit of a put down but BETH, nor anyone can cater to everyone's needs, so it's understandable
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt realize I had just got 48 so wen I logged on last night and saw that was the goal I just said fuck it
---
There's alot of bugs with 4s building they remove them and added new ones
---
Wait til you get to level 190 lol
---
Buttressed for the primary mod on everything.  These are my suggestions for a sneak build: For the secondary mod on legs, Sleek adds movement speed.  For the arms, I believe it‚Äôs called Stabilized (allows you to aim without needing to hold your breath).  
---
Side note: I think there are more armor mods coming in the next patch.  So you might want to wait if you can, in case something better shows up.
---
God damn! I barely hit whichever rank gives the lunchbox after the Ghillie Combat Armor. 81, you can definitely rest up a few days lmao
---
Incorrect.
---
&gt;you‚Äôre fine
---
Well, at least until I finally turn in all those tokens only to get like cork scraps or something. üòù
---
NAILED IT.
---
Overall I‚Äôve had easier times doing almost everything I want to do. Farming for scrap is easier because you know it‚Äôll be there as long as you haven‚Äôt been there recently. Xp farming is easier because the super mutants are always still alive at west tek. You could try server hopping for some of the plans you mentioned though.
---
Incorrect. Run the silo again and it will tell you to input code when you try inserting a new key.
---
In theory, I'm only wanting the Gold Bullion rewards because the grind for the Secret Service Armor is worth it.  It's overall the most powerful Armor currently in the game, along with the Mods.
---
Well i guess i forgot to add in the "dibs" system. Where everything goes through your filter first before being put in the Free for all party inventory. So there's that... thanks for the comment!
---
There are three events I will always jump at the moment they are active.
---
1. Uranium fever - guaranteed 3 legendaries, so long as your able to tag them all before some level 8million instakills them
---
2. Project paradise - a metric butt ton of creatures spawn in the enclosures each with a chance to spawn as a legendary. Plus the final alpha at the end of the event will always be a legendary I can usually walk away with 4 to 5 legendaries from this event 
---
3. Radiation rumble - an overwhelming amount of feral ghouls spawn in this event and are often legendaries. Plus for every 20 irradiated ore you deposit, a wave of high level creatures will spawn (floaters, snallygasters, deathclaws .etc) and usually come with 1 to 2 legendary with them.
---
Me too! Literally today lol.
---
Il still grind tokens though, cus im use to doing it haha
---
I dont even know the exact rewards for those tokens but hopefully not just cork :( I wish you luck man üëç
---
For real, I had to stop fighting the SBQ bc my ammo kept getting dumped for shit reward when Id rather get score from killing scorched than a plan I have already or nothing at all.  Congrats on the level, apologies for the late reply lol
---
Yeah, I admit that ‚ÄúPretty much every Nuclear Winter challenge‚Äù was a bit of an exaggeration.
---
If you wish, you may see my other reply to a different individual in this comment thread for further elaboration on my part.
---
Oh ok gotchu
---
Same boat (although not 466).  It's faster to make a level 0 noob character and get a guaranteed level.  It feels so bad not having your regular perks, though.  I decided to try to 1v4 then realized that the TTK is much much higher when you dont have tank killer or rifle perks and they're all kitted in marine armor lol
---
I goto fallout 76 and put my stuff for transfer in the bag that‚Äôs in the shopping cart near the two girls that came with wastelanders. I have had fallout 1st since I came back to the game in October and I was always scared to do this but then I did it and I have two nuke accounts and I‚Äôm finally down to 300 pounds
---
Text chat would come in handy in situations like this
---
Add another foundation, then add a wall to connect to the floor that's now attached to the stairs. Game has a lot of quirks with building.
---
This HAD to have been my most used piece of building equipment in FO4. SOOOOO many stacked stairwells.
---
&gt; but I wish it was a little easier in this game
---
It's fine, IMO. I like doing sudokus, crosswords, solving rubik's cubs, trying to fit two water melon crops in the same farming patch ... I hope the building system will never change! /s
---
Mad respect to you for building such a camp!
---
Sorry about that. Something similar once worked for me, probably in a different configuration.
---
It's apparently not the right word for it English I'm sorry just changed it.
---
It definitely still works
---
I feel you.  I lost 5 of each insect part the other day to a disconnect after a random death during a hoard event. Thank goodness I got to keep that radroach meat.
---
I'm gonna disagree with you. Grind is a specific recurring gaming activity, done in order to achieve some in-game rewards. If you are killing and end-game enemy (say, a big flying mutated bat) for some materials (say, a component to make more powerful ammo) in order to do it faster next time, that's a grind. If you are doing 5 things to tick a daily, so you can have an incremental gain on a battlepass towards a cosmetics item, thats's grind.  
---
If it's not apparent, I hate the idea of grind, hence my vastly different playstyle and a topic of this forum.
---
Yep this - not sure how any of the other options even compete...
---
Hacking terminals there is an option for aid package
---
That player has already entered a key without launching and inputting the code that week.
---
Well for some players that was the only way they got atoms. I get them from fo1st and they piled up. I played to about level 24 on the board in less than two weeks and bought to level 99 with 10k atoms. Finished level 100 the next day.  Now do you understand why players want atom challenges? Not everyone can pay for a sub thats clearly an advantage.
---
It's more fun to me than most BRs out there, tbh.  Warzone was fun until all the hackers decided to infest that game.  Upside is I see less hackers in NW, so presumably they all moved to WZ because it lets them kill even more people and pretend to be something they are not: actually skilled in games.
---
If you run speed demon, sleek mod makes no difference as speed demon already puts you at the sneak movement speed limit.
---
Like 99.9% of these are from console players with 0.1% of an idea of what they're talking about.
---
Really? I seem to still get them.  I‚Äôll test it out again tonight. I don‚Äôt see why you shouldn‚Äôt since the even is still completed. But I‚Äôll double check thank you.
---
You can get them from the pass too and the normal eorld challenges
---
Really, like way back, almost 2 years ago?  I have to admit, when it first dropped, it took me a bit to explore and get to the areas where the higher levels were.  It was my first Fallout game and I was trying to pick up some of the lore.
---
Try and put atomic shop paints on it if you have it. I have everything painted except my lmg (wish it had a golden/raider skin to match all my other items but oh well) so I can‚Äôt ever accidentally scrip, sell, or drop anything important
---
lol i remember when it came out and all the praise.
---
karen
---
I'll have to try that out.
---
It cost me about 8750 scrip for a full set of unyielding SS.
---
Ridiculous to be honest.
---
4 out of my 5 rolled pieces have garbage stats.
---
That's the irony of it all.
---
Completely agree. Even the Appalachian Thunderpipe skin covers up where you aim so you can't even see what you're shooting when you aim, so there goes first person, here comes third, where aiming doesn't even work up close. The caps, atoms and bullion rewards were minimal at best! I mean 1000 caps?! I can make that in a half hour taking my time and not selling anything from my vending machines. The scrap kits are worthless, I've only used one to see what it did and I put the rest in my stash cause I'd never use them until I got rid of First. 
---
Ghillie armor is worthless since you can't use any of it in NW and you already have the ghillie suit, which counts as an outfit and fits over any armor. If anything the armor should've been a different skin or the ghillie suit should've come out later this year or not at all, because the ghillie suit totally makes the armor worthless. 
---
The lunchboxes were ok. The buffs are nice and they add a sense of teamwork and fun, so good call there. But I better not see them in the Atom Shop! You'll really go against your whole "we won't add game breaking stuff" by adding those.
---
The camp stuff is basically worthless anyway. I mean the ammo converter system is broken where if you spam one ammo type for 5 minutes, you spend 5 minutes backing out of all the pages you've opened! I'm better off selling my useless ammo to lower level players and buying or making ammo. Heck, I would've preferred an ammo scrapper to break ammo down to base components. Also the chicken coop is worthless! I'd rather have a brahmin that can double up with fertilizer AND milk! Chickens only give me fertilizer. The clean sink is nice, but again only gives you dirty water, so with the water well or the rustic sink, I still get the same stuff and both look more lore friendly than the clean one! 
---
The atom rewards were an absolute joke! Let's be honest, you were tired of people earning daily atoms because it meant you weren't getting money so you gave us the exact amount of atoms to rank up again SCORE-wise. Added up, your atom rewards aren't enough to get a decent bundle! Let alone a PA skin or even a decent outfit that is brand new!
---
Double SCORE is worthless once you've completed the season anyway. With double XP, cranberry relish, well rested, path to enlightenment and the full build events team, my friends and I were pounding away at levels on lower characters and xp and we finished the whole season by Monday last week. You should get atoms after finishing a season, instead of giving us nothing but to wait till the next season.
---
Anyways I'm done. I've said my peace.
---
Nope, he can launch from that same silo without a new card by swapping servers, until weeklies reset on Tuesday.
---
Sure. Why not kill off the last remnants of pvp in the game. Lmao
---
But don't you become wanted if you claim someone's workshop? I've been marked wanted twice for picking locks at workshops I didn't know were claimed and didn't show as red.
---
While true, I hope they bring it back during other times since some people like me wont be able to play in November.
---
Yeah it takes me about 5 minutes. üò™
---
Mostly grinding for perk card packs. For the  perk legendary update. All my characters are high level. Harder to achieve them now.
---
It is high quality but i have zero interest in that and will absolutely never use it.So is the chicken coop,or the monkey backpack. tastes.
---
Wow that‚Äôs pretty awesome. Lol don‚Äôt  think I‚Äôm playing the same game as you, nothing looks that good when I take a photo.
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
And power armor displays. I wanna feel like iron man surrounded by a wall of power armor
---
I'd say it's a bit of addiction, bit of warm fuzzy feeling of familiarity with gameplay mechanics, bit of low hanging fruit and a sense of achievement, that can be achieved via simple repeated activity.  
---
I'm guilty of all those, but then who isn't.
---
I need that t65 skin so after that I may be less inclined to worry about it so much but at that point I might as well finish it.
---
It used to get buried under the fur, at least on Xbox anyway so it's cool to see they changed it
---
Equip Pharma Farmer from Luck.  
---
Start near the Grafton Mill (I usually go with the Silo entrance in the NE corner).  
---
If people spawn there: hide, wait for them to leave, then search.  
---
If they don't: search.  
---
Check every box, unopened or otherwise, and with a little luck you should get more than enough Stimpaks.  
---
Now, climb on top of one of it's higher rooves but not like the really high gantries or anything.  
---
Jump off, take damage, stim, repeat until done.
---
Very interesting read , thank you!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure in total it only gives you 500 or less bullion from the whole season. Is it really worth it for you if you‚Äôre spending 30 or more minutes a day grinding when u could just turn in your notes for 2 1/2 days and get the same amount?
---
i think BBC ran an article on it about a week ago, there was also an article in Wired magazine sometime ago, and there was  an old documentary show that mentions it, but I cannot find it atm, I want to say it was the history channel, but i'm probably wrong.
---
I only still play it because I want the outcast paint for my PA other than that it sucks ass
---
Welcome!!
---
Read this and a boyz in the hood scene popped in my head.
---
If you put in a keycard on a different server, but didn't launch, you would be able to skip it and put the code in.
---
If you had previously launched from that same silo earlier in the week, it remembers that you entered code.
---
If you do both, you can skip right to the targeting computer like the *antagonist* in OPs story.
---
Some I like some aren‚Äôt for me but that‚Äôs how it should be
---
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúhidden‚Äù weapon skins or paints, unless you count the 2 PA paints but none of that requires or even is easier with a private server
---
Penny don't care about the Penniless.
---
Target the engines. Each one gone slows it down. Crit hits help a lot.
---
It's extra Bullion but yeah.  Some days I just do solo grinding for resources because of how often I use my weapons or armor being damaged.
---
Haha
---
There are a few on Top of the World, but no easter eggs.
---
I‚Äôm surprised you read it considering the typos I can now see looking back. 
---
I really must stop spilling stuff in my mechanical keyboard üòÅ
---
I would be happier if they brought survival back tbh but it doesn't seem like they have any intention of doing so.
---
I'm still rolling for chameleon with ap. Have unyielding ap
---
Thanks for all the suggestions! I will do some researching on these titles. Do any of these have a retro-futuristic vibe? The fallout universe is just so appealing to me. The like 50‚Äôs nostalgia mixed with nuclear tech with a bit of Cold War feeling.
---
I can‚Äôt believe this game doesn‚Äôt have a series of novels to it yet.
---
I‚Äôll try to have a look, thanks
---
Generally you can tell such a workshop by the fact it hasn't been built up at all and/or has lapsed to its 'overun' status.
---
But this is a great idea to make it clear.
---
You don‚Äôt have to go to the hunter first. Just go straight to the raider
---
Wait. If I start a new character it works for my same legendary run? It doesn't start a new one for that character?
---
If G(T)odd didn‚Äôt want me hide in a bush He wouldn‚Äôt have given me a ghillie suit.
---
Legend.  I installed on new machine, same issue.  Gave this a shot, boots right up.  Thank You!
---
I‚Äôve heard it was a large inspiration for the game and I think I even saw someone say it particularly inspired the brotherhood of steel.
---
I would use someone else but the settler... well I don‚Äôt think settlers take too kindly to raiders, Beckett left the raiders so he‚Äôs a chump and gramps is a weirdo who says ‚Äútouch my toe and tickle my thumb‚Äù or something stupid
---
They spawn in that location quite regularly bog town workshop.
---
And I hope your face is half as stupid looking as you are, or else I fear for any nearby mirrors
---
Oh god my hopes went down for me. I‚Äôm still trying for unyielding on the left arm
---
I try to leave my characters a few XP from leveling up, then when I log in after the challenges have gone live.
---
A few times I‚Äôve screwed up by making some food before and leveling up, in those cases it can take about 90 minutes to finish everything. Usually it‚Äôs about 30 minutes,  if there are 3 legendaries to kill I just do circuit of fissure prime , sundew then riding shotgun .. that‚Äôs usually enough if not another quick jog around the fissures
---
I just use a mule. Easier to level up 1-10 than it is to level up my main lvl 51.
---
Except, it existed in game prior to survival, so your logic is flawed. Also. Game had better mechanics when it first came out than it does now. 
---
This is a trash post of someone who likes to take away from others things that don't even have to effect him. 
---
Just stay in passive and hang out in your camp. I get it. The wasteland is scaarrrrryyy for some folk. That is why they had to make night brighter. üòé
---
I wouldn't want to change your mind.
---
Nuclear Winter really is just Fallout 76's attempt at jumping on board popular trends with very mixed results. There's basically no other reason for it to exist, and they're probably too embarrassed to can it like they did Survival mode, so they double down on it rather than admit it probably lacks the same sort of player retention, or that it has some questionable design choices.
---
Cannot unsee
---
I'm doing them just like I did them before to get atoms. But I would prefer the old setup to collect atoms and just use them to buy whatever cosmetics I'm interested in. But mainly, it's a good way to waste a couple of hours on a day, and that's mainly what comes down to it with me. Find a game with an interesting grind, at least, when the main content is over.  I haven't looked at the very end run rewards so I can't say if I would pay atoms to get to the end content, but at this point I don't intend to do that.
---
Lots of stuff is wrong with that game ... sadly
---
Yeah I hate that stupid lag when you‚Äôre in the stash box. The thing I hate the most though is it only happens sometimes, so they could likely fix it but are too lazy
---
This is great!  I love when people use the letters for anything. 
---
Can I just say though how sad it is to initiate pvp over some of these workshops? I had two assholes kill me to take Tyler county. Like. What losers. You can have it. No need to kill me.
---
He just wanted your picnic basket
---
For me, it feels like Bethesda abandoned PvP encounters in favor of nuclear winter. Which is sad, I enjoyed PvP within the survival mode.
---
But your comment leads me to believe I'm missing something. Is PvP still common in adventure mode? It might be that I just don't see it as I'm not seeking it out.
---
If PvP is still commonplace and people enjoy gearing for it specifically then that is a different story.
---
Make a new character just for nw
---
It would be awesome to be able to pick and place  bears, gnomes and other items to create our own Easter Eggs/ Environmental stories to leave behind for our fellow Vault Dwellers. Would make wandering the wasteland so interesting.
---
In GW2 another game I play the devs made a bunch of mounts for the expansion, one of them was supposed to be a spider that can climb walls, apparently it was axed because Some people have a phobia. Ridiculous because that sounded awesome to me.
---
You got a link? For a friend?
---
Agreed. Good luck against anyone running autos fully perked out. I also don't want to have to play an alt just to be able to complete a challenge. I'm guessing Bethesda didn't expect anyone to level up as high as some of us have in NW üòÇ
---
Awesome idea, I like it when I find funny stuff like this at workshops even if they're unclaimed. I made my own with some extra flair at the end. :P
---
https://i.gyazo.com/fb5b49a545b8dbbccde3c92ad6d1f8f1.jpg
---
That plans is absolutely expensive.
---
You are pretty angry man. I just see a gear type that doesn't make sense to me. I'm seeing now that people still like and use it.
---
It's not a trash post it's a discussion. Not sure what your deal is. We could have an actual exchange of info here. Not mud throwing.
---
I know this doesn‚Äôt help the core issue with it, but if you have the Fasnacht Collectron he gathers ALOT of gum. At least a bandaid fix for the time being if you don‚Äôt want to scrounge for it
---
I've done this and had no problems follow this from now on and let me know if it happens again. Just curious. Dont play nw first time logging in is what I meant*
---
Another easy thing to do is to claim the work shop right before logging off. You get the tally for it, and it immediately goes back up for grabs
---
Hey boo boo! What‚Äôs in your picnic basket?!
---
The moment they get rid of the hacked weapons, modify &amp; level the builds for more even PvP, and get rid of the exploits, I'd be happy to support some manner of PvP.
---
Until then, what's the point?
---
It‚Äôs simple yet I still realized this WAY too late.
---
Collect every weapon and scrap it!
---
- Base stats are too low.
---
- No SPECIAL scaling
---
- No explosive resist
---
- Gunplay clunky
---
- Frequent animation glitches
---
- Buildmode interface gets you killed, esp. on PC
---
- %damage perks are essential
---
- turrets aren't set up properly (kill teammates)
---
- Frog legs needs to be a mutation
---
- weapon wheel buggy, laggy
---
- SSD gives huge advantage
---
- Map renders out of bounds areas, so it's laggy
---
- XP and progression system unbalanced
---
- kill denied
---
Lvl 76 now . I played 100% of my time ahahah
---
these photos are nutz
---
I do that with xp as well.
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets)
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup. 
---
and have fun. There's no hurry
---
I don't really care as I took a month break and so missed a ton of levels, but was still really happy with my non-snappable RR garage.
---
i agree.  Go play COD for pvp.  Battlefield and COD mobile are free af.
---
The only sort of common denominator is crashing or freezing on logging in.  That‚Äôs about 70% of the time I autocomplete.  I‚Äôve played during reset, played NW before and after reset, even once during reset and it didn‚Äôt trigger.  They said they added a logging tool because they have no definitive answer as to what causes it.
---
Finding 3 stims is not that hard,even on the outside. Then just get in and out of the fire to lose a bit of health.
---
That's what stings the most.  I am totally fine with Atoms for completely new objects.  But when an asset exists in the game already, it's something I can physically see in the game world, and Bethesda just packages it and puts a 600-1200 Atom price tag on it, I get really pissed.
---
Not much different than the daily atom challenges.
---
Good rewards is relative - just like the atom shop, there are a few things (along the path) I like, a few things I dont care about, and a few more that I would like to earn.
---
My biggest issue with it is I lack the camp budget to place most of the stuff I like :)
---
I claimed a workshop from a low level, built him a bunch of stuff for free, and then let him take it back.
---
Thank you! I kept seeing people saying they solo‚Äôd the event and I felt like I was going crazy because I always need like 3 people because we need two MINIMUM to get 100 ore. Me and my two siblings regularly run it together and one person shoots and two of us collect. We also use the friendly fire perk if the shooter gets overrun.
---
And i refuse to play it.  They can shine the NW score points up real nice, turn them sideways... You know the rest lol.
---
I think I was level 170 something before I launched my nuke. Not having anyone to team up with friends list wise, I just waited forever to make sure I had the level to do it alone. Pretty much worried about nothing. The worst robots were the machine gun type Gutsy's. I usually killed them first. It did take me awhile to run it. Used some extra damage against and less taken mags for the robots. Used a few psycho meds. Had to do the repair pipes part twice because I couldn't find all the repair points and was more worried with killing robots. Wised up on second try. Ran most of it with instigating shotgun. Didn't have enough people show up to kill the SBQ but whatever. Also, I'm really lazy so I just waited a few days into the reset and googled the launch codes.
---
I have dealt with this too, seven of the yao guai at high levels .... at first i thought it was the horde event but nope! .... was frustrating, thankfully i had my shotgun to take care of them
---
In case you dont know....
---
If you put your cursor on the pushpins of those maps,  the site name will appear on screen.  Press X (on ps4, anyway); if you have not discovered that location, it  will be added to your map.
---
Congrats on staying alive, I definitely couldn‚Äôt pull that off.
---
Buy the plans for the mods from watoga station. Thank me later

"Tea Time Moo-ther effer"
---
Scrolling also allows you to see the negative posts.
---
My opinion also stands, that was alot to write just to say that...
---
Agreed on all but joining from adventure mode.
---
- glitch gear into NW like when it first launched
---
- disable mods on PC to play adventure too
---
- players would leave ghosts on the adventure server they left. Among other technical issues
---
I know there's some luck involved but leader of the pack near the fairgrounds seems to pop up regularly. Most days that's what I use for the 3 legendaries, if I don't just accidentally run into a few.
---
I also have a couple lower level characters that I can jump over to for the level up challenge.
---
I like to be thorough.
---
My Claustrophobia would ask questions but I'll say that your C.A.M.P. is fantastic.  Good job!

Honesty thats adorable! üòç

Whenever someone mentions karma, it's an easy insta block lol. Bye kid.

Nothing in this dreadful mode should be.

People who
---
- don't play the game
---
- only use VATS, in 3rd POV, with an Xbox controller
---
That's happened to me 3 or 4 times now.
---
I bulk and sell unneeded junk to a bot - faster that way.
---
Pretty much the only junk item I regularly sell in my vendor is acid, below MSRP.

Nice photo!

Excellent, thank you, it's good to know they are actually planning on this. I just unlocked the skin and use a Fixer regularly.
---
Holy hand grenades
---
Stay away from the negative rants here. Play YOUR game. Welcome back to the Wasteland.
---
They NEED to bring it back. Bethesda said that after wastelanders, they'd look at the feedback from the community and make adjustments. Well were waaay past wastelanders and all we've gotten is more restrictions and more bugs. Its pitiful at best. The game was marketed as having open world pvp, it was literally the first thing they showed in the announcement trailer. They need to hold up their end of the deal and provide the community with what some of us specifically bought the game for. But we all know thats never going to happen. Their not done milking the PvE community of all their hard earned money.
---
Well...when it comes to daily challenges the people who play everyday probably should earn more then the people who play 3 days a week. 
---
Youre saying you get it...but nothing in this makes it seem like you get what they were saying...
---
I'm just saying it'd be nice to build them and more items to detail up your camp.
---
You can i have bright default and vault boy i can equip rn
---
I stand corrected, there is no hope for you. You had so many chances to redeem yourself by making an argument and wasted all of them trying to insult me to  sound smart and edgy. You are neither.
---
It's still really bad after all that. We basically run around with 0 SPECIAL because scaling is disabled. The entire sprint system is balanced around having ~5 END and AGL.
---
They could buff the base stats for these mechanics in one click and it would breathe a lot of life into this mode.
---
Guess they like more people dying to fire than to players?
---
And it will be until 2040
---
I have a friend like this and I'm close to blocking him, he's level 40 now and was 18 when we met, all he does is beg for power armor sets, everytime we go in the trade menu he requests my legacies, and he always asks for all my ammo, like I didnt mind helping him along, in fact I love it, it makes me happy. but he is just too dependent on me and I cant stand it
---
edit: made up all my lost karma today lmao thanks everyone
---
oh wow.  pet fight club?  YES!
---
Owlet?
---
Whats up with her face as well.
---
 ... i go t-o th-e ... divine manager
---
Sound is probably one of the officer scorched with nuke code fragment, its following you around so a bug? probably
---
Well hello there, Satan
---
im stealing this this is to handy... take an upvote!
---
A tiny skeleton-like baby owl thing.
---
Edit owl not towel
---
It's so hard to not read NW as New Wegas
---
Adventure mode is very bad because the game is not even balanced for PVE, let alone PVP.
---
The terrible UI and movement animations are what seals the deal, as NW makes perfectly clear.
---
The wolf pack one at the fair grounds. Counts as both an event and you get 3 low level legendary wolves. Easy as pie.
---
Exactly. They're way too dependent on us. I may be the tank of my group but I'm sure as hell not spending all of my resources to make the noobs rich! Hell, I don't even ask *my* suppliers for excessive amounts of stuff. I have a hard enough time just asking for a couple of things because I don't want to be a moocher like some of these other motherfuckers.
---
Who in gods name ever thought any of these were viable prefixes to begin with. But exterminators absolutely is the most laughable. 
---
Theres also several that should be level locked to 25 and below. 
---
Does anyone use auto stim, regenerating or life saving past level 25?
---
Manage to play for 5 hours without getting a disconnect (500 score)
---
Level doesn‚Äôt really matter - sometimes your stuff gets picked up, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Most mats are easy enough to get, so Not really a problem unless you are carrying hard(er) to obtain  stuff (like stable flux).
---
Although from a lower level player perspective, I recall a time when I thought losing all my junk was the worst....
---
My GT is 'Ghost Dog'. No numbers after it. What's yours?
---
There are five allies, last I checked. üòâ
---
Looks like mothman just went super saiyan
---
Imagine events with multiple competiting faction objectives.
---
Ie: Enclave calls in resource drops. Other factions need to steal the drop for their own needs. PVP over the drop.
---
__
---
Imo every location should have a workshop. Workshops should actually be viable XP/resource farms.
---
Build mode isn't necessary.
---
Honeybeasts kind of merged a bee with a tarantula, but just in looks
---
Radiation rumble, uranium fever, whitespring gulf club usually has at least 1, queen will have at least 1, free range has one, riding shotgun has one, heart of the swamp may have some.
---
You got an extra bright plan? I had w couriers with all mods unlocked screenshot the helmet mod section and there was no options to change the headlamp
---
I never did daily atom challenges before and don‚Äôt care much for the score daily. 
---
The one and only item I was truly interested in is the white raider skull gas mask. I‚Äôm too far in to quit this season (rank 60) so I‚Äôll finish it up. But my participation in future seasons will be minimal at best unless the rewards get crazy good, which I doubt.
---
radiation rumble has a few. Horde events. uranium fever. Awol armaments. there's one in morgantown airport terminal right near the room where you get the small backpack plan
---
I feel ya 100% on this. I‚Äôve got about 3 sets of players that won‚Äôt stop leaving me alone when I‚Äôm on these days. Always wanting new armor and weapons when they get to new levels, wanting me to help with their quests, etc. Very annoying
---
Oh yeah, I'm all about that max rank sneak card for that cave these days
---
What? I've never gotten to the end without a bunch of stuff. I'm not sure resources are scarce at that point. Maybe maybe stimpacks but that's it
---
Yup.  I agree with you.
---
I just give them necessities and what they need and I normally add them, and then never see them again, but this guy joins all my worlds, fast travels to me all the time, requests trades, requests everything in my inventory, it just gets so annoying
---
Just go to West Tek or the Clubhouse. You'll get it in less than 5 minutes
---
I shouldn‚Äôt take more than 10 minutes to find legendary enemies thanks to fast travel. 
---
Check fisssure sites and whitesprings if you‚Äôre over level 50. Uranium fever has 3 legendaries. Leader of the pack has 3 as well.
---
It's insane. I thought about it several times when I had the caps for it but just couldn't bring myself to spend that much on a single plan.
---
Blocks their chat, not that you could hear them anyways.
---
Not sure if blocking hides your dot on their map when they hack a terminal, but hackers skip that step.
---
This is what I'm currently experiencing. He always follows me from server to server. He is just a kid so I don't want to go into total bitch mode on him, but he's starting to remind me why I stopped helping people awhile back.
---
So is that how it happens? Crashing when logging in completed challenges?
---
Becausd that's what happened to me, too. 7 of 9 completed and one that wasn't was the NW.
---
The PVP Softcore Survival they advertised is still there. But it does seem like they're focusing more on Nuclear Winter to cater more to the PvP crowd. But in the end it's more about camp building and adventuring
---
I'm also annoyied by the "buy 3 items from player". They're easy but doing them every day is too boring. There are over 50 challenges,yet 4/9 are always the same.
---
Each fissure site spawns a scorchbeast every 10-15mins. And from those scorchbeasts a big % are legendary ones. There are several sites across the map, and x number of servers....
---
Yeah some just put you back in the plane you drop from.
---
Lol, that would be awesome.
---
Can i please have ju... jk i do to buit i dont get followed. Just dont give them too mich or they will follow u. Also ik its hard not to give away alot but really try
---
So far it‚Äôs my best guess.
---
I've wanted a proper Shack type shack like we had in Fallout 4 since BETA. It's a Wasteland, how would a bunch of Vault Dwellers be able to mill pristine walls and doors in the middle of a location like The Ash Heap?  Even the vanilla wooden walls are too nice for the setting of the game, let us have the ability to construct a CAMP home that looks as if we've had to scavenge building supplies. Ramshackle walls, an old blue tarp for a roof, a rickety wooden staircase. Hell even being able to use old wooden pallets for flooring would be a good start.
---
If you are high enough level, go to whitesprings.
---
there are normally 3-5 between the cottage,laundry building, and golf clubhouse.
---
If you can fast travel and see leader of the pack or uranium fever pop, hop there.  You‚Äôll get 3 from either.
---

---
yeah I might just stop completely, I'd be a lot more better off and id stop spoiling kids that arent mine lol
---
It was classic Doublespeak. Genius marketing.
---
The mode needs love and improvements the way Bethesda operates it totally lazy they release and forget and might add something dumbass minor every y months just to say they update it
---
I hate it when this happens. It's happened like 3 times to me and had to redo my whole base because of it. Feelsbadman
---
Ive never come across such a thing. Will definitely look out for one!
---
üòÇ This is the best post I've seen here in weeks! I love it.
---
Thanks, completely forgot about the fissure sites üôÑ. It's still a pain travelling around right enough.
---
Ah, I have an admirer
---
It‚Äôs a Bethesda title, don‚Äôt spam anything...liable  to make the game explode
---
None of the advancements NW has added have been implemented into the base game. Literally what are they doing?
---
Herd mentality works in a group all by your lonesome even, and no you don‚Äôt have to be anywhere near any group members as a result of that. 
---
So you continue to be antisocial, you beautiful butterfly, you.
---
I have pretty much infinite resources so I'm all about repairing their shit and making sure they ain't too squish...but come on, dude. People need to learn boundaries.
---
Also I think if you don't use a specific tab (just the 'inventory' one) and don't change the sort order then you don't get the issue.
---
WHAT?! But i spent so so long on my base!
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Creatures tend to have stims on them. I have a spot I always drop in Morgantown that has two crates that tend to have one. 
---
Completed in about 3 minutes.
---
Think this is the quest of her living nightmares hahaha
---
No witchhunting in this reddit. üòò
---
Pretty much.  Like what the shit.
---
I've been doing most of mine at White Springs half club. A few rounds gives me the legendaries and my level no problem. The "One Violent Night" event produces 3 to 5 legendaries every time I do it as well.
---
Yes like showing the active effects in the wheel menu, that'd be pretty usefull.
---
I have one friend who only did it to level 5 for the Ammo Converter, then didn't bother. He's level 14 or 15 now with casual play, never looking at the challenges.
---
On the other end of the spectrum...
---
I run 4 accounts. All are around level 60 or so now. It's been a ***major*** chore doing this for 4 accounts. I have a system now, but it's still not something I will do again next season.
---
I can‚Äôt shake these nightmares...
---
God. Fucking. Dammit. I've had this camp for SO LONG. Now i have to get rid of it because of some shitty glitch.
---
Is the scrapbox fully functional after the sub lapses or are you only able to remove items at that point?
---
The one that smelt it dealt it!!!!
---
Happy hunting. I really wish I could've taken a pic while it was alive.
---
Despite the pip boy status effect saying ‚Äú +2 special when near teammates‚Äù you just need to be in a group, you don‚Äôt have to do anything with your teammates. And you could even be in a public group by yourself and it will work
---
Enemies posing anything resembling a challenge.
---
Been there, done that.
---
  If your platform allows it, change your Status setting from online to offline.  It‚Äôll won‚Äôt stop it, but it will cut it down a little bit.
---
Especially if (like on PS4), said person can set a flag to notify them when you logon to the console - I was getting hit up before I had even logged in to the game.
---
The photo of the year
---
Do you have the encrypted radio signal playing? Or another radio station?
---
Sorry, the quote was taken from [this article](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/48zcUmxp7O2se0CIMMwmGg/fallout-76-upcoming-features-and-fixes-november-2018).  
---
And yea, you're right. I'm sure they've done somethings to make it possible, even though the (public) server's still run like they're powered by hamsters.  
---
Stability and optimization doesn't really seem to be priority for them though. If it was they wouldn't have went with a weight system but a total item count, similar to ESO. Or with crafting/cooking, why can we not multi-craft/multi-cook? If you have 30 meals to cook, that is 30 requests to the server, when it could just be 1 request.  
---
I just felt like it was a slap in the face to alot of us. Granted they did double it from when the game launched, it just sounded like they were going to increase it further as things became more stable. I like this game it's just almost every update and addition seems to be centered around some sort of monetization. But anyways who knows, maybe they will increase storage further at some point.
---
That ini file is already in My Games, do I overwrite it?  edit: nvm, this oesnt fix the game not launching error for disk missing.
---
Stop calling them hackers, you really giving them too much credit, they script kiddies with no skills at best or just little kiddies with no life.
---
This SCORE challenge has made me hate NW.  I think that was what Bethesda trying to do.  My guess is so they don't have to support it anymore.  What do you guys think?
---
I agree. I don't like nuclear winter that much, I don't usually do pvp and stick to teams. Not used to nuclear winter and aometimes I skip the score for ranking up because it just takes long. I find it a bit boring and I don't like that they force you to play it if you want the score.
---
NW is still in beta, it just feels like they're trying to get more people on it too. And I really don't want to do thing I don't want to for more score. 
---
They have separate game modes for that reason and most of the score rewards aren't even for NW so for poeple that aren't interested NW challenges are useless for adventure mode players
---
There are
---
Actually one time I did fix it by making more ceilings, then a new set of stairs coming off of them, and deleting the stairs that couldn't be deleted before, but when I tried doing that the next time it happened I couldn't get it to work, so no promises.
---
I had a random level 18 come to my camp and he kept making the gift emote so I thought he was going to give me a gift. Then he messaged me and asked for stuff lol. I gave him like 50 556 so he‚Äôd go away and I never saw him again
---
I hope ya figure something out
---
I don't even know what this event is and I've received credit for it so many times
---
There's behemoths in this game? I haven't seen one yet.
---
Pretty sure it works like this.
---
Let‚Äôs say you have a rifle doing 100 damage. Explosive adds either 20% or 25%, I can‚Äôt remember let‚Äôs just say 20% to keep it simple.
---
Your rifle is doing 120 damage with just the explosive effect. 
---
60% of 20 would be 12, so now your rifle is doing 132.
---
Someone can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but that makes sense to me, though I‚Äôve never actually tested it out to see if that‚Äôs exactly how it applies or not
---
This is why I have my settlement in the far reaches of the map to avoid any new players from getting near me as the are almost certian to not have the caps for fast travel. I'm level 65 but still have a respectable  amount of gear lying around in my stash and displays.
---
Excellent, thank you for the info!
---
Seal pfp?
---
Ive had that same issue happen to me so many times its unbelievable
---
Mines Russianpeter
---
That is true, though its been this way with games for years on years now. For Fallout, criticising is more popular than anything from what I've seen. I believe it just has it is though. People tend to say nothing if they like something and say a lot if they don't.
---
You have mined them already sometime sooner today. It has a cool down but appears full. It‚Äôs always been like this u fortunately.
---
and if you're in a group with someone mutated and strange in numbers is active you'll get +4
---
at least i do
---
[Couldn't agree more](https://imgur.com/CJrRCAl) i guess
---
Thank you very much for clearing it up, it was the whole being near a team mate thing that was putting me off from using it. You know social distancing and all!
---
I would personally LOVE to further decorate, but maintaining my 10-per-plant farm takes up too much of my storage space... Moth-Fan Farms needs more camp space
---
They've said it will be available until the next major patch, which I believe is happening 8/4
---
I didnt know that thanks for the info
---
No it's not the Officer Beep, I recognize that noise. This is much faster, almost a robotic 'spring' noise.
---
Place 1 2x1 stairway wherever you want, then place a tall vertical steel beam (under the stairs tab) on one of the edges of the stairs, then place another beam on top of that beam, then delete the bottom beam and place the 2nd 2x1 stairs under the floating beam and it should line up to be on top of the 1st set of stairs. You might need to mess with it a little to get it where you want it to be.
---
You cannot put anything in. Only remove.
---
That's a... great suggestion. I'll check that!
---
I know it's not ideal, but just don't button mash.  This has happened to me, but never when I don't button mash.
---
couldnt figure out how to join these typed in my platform and stuff in the channel but never got access after a couple of hours so left. Hate servers that do crap like that. Can never figure it out
---
Lack of self restraint isn‚Äôt a mental illness
---
Oh you mean my 3 floor mansion with nothing but workbenches, a bed, 1 vendor station, and no doors isn't aesthetically pleasing?
---
Sorry, but lack of self restraint doesn‚Äôt qualify as a mental illness
---
Caps
---
Man I should have been using it from the jump! Been missing out on those sweet sweet bonuses! Anything helps with the grind. I feel like it‚Äôs moving so slow. Probably doesn‚Äôt help I get distracted by every lootable thing in the game.
---
Dependance breeds dependance.  Don't help them at all.  I didn't need it.  You didn't need it.  They don't ethier.
---
That is love for the game and for building camp, I share that taste with you, you have chosen very good objects that would help make our camps better
---
Yes. The legendary challenges can be completed across all characters. You have to be careful when claiming certain rewards like caps, scrap kits, scrip, as those will be given to whichever character you have selected at the time.
---
I believe the majority of events reward you with enough caps to pay for the fast travel, plus the other random goodies and xp
---
I'd be all for just having the "Please Stand By" image on them, personally.
---
I don't know how well this engine handles playing movies or rendering remote scenes on monitors.  I can't think of many examples where it happens, outside of the newscaster at the start of Fallout 4.
---
Since you‚Äôre using fireproof I assume you‚Äôre using an explosive weapon? If you are, switch out gunsmith for demo expert, it boosts your damage
---
 Is there a way to view the rewards and how much for xp i need to get them?
---
You need \~220k score for rank 100 and will have 110k around rank 63-64.
---
Mother heifer
---
I will join you in 5 mins.
---
I prefer the head with the Camden park uniform.
---
Go make one right now on your helemt
---
empath also works solo in a team.
---
but once again. better if you're with people
---
Sorry, just saw this.  I will be back ingame between 1:30 and 2pm pacific time.
---
You must‚Äôve already had some 5.56 in your inventory or maybe it‚Äôs just a quirk with the way the game rounds numbers
---
As are Bobby Pins
---
I played 3 matches last night to level up from 3 to 4. It could be a really good game mode but it's so unbalanced. One match most everyone was level 35 and up but me.
---
I‚Äôm not home and I don‚Äôt even have a T-51b helmet on my character or in my stash
---
You can Google it, I've seen plenty of info on it - just didn't save any links.
---
But I know there is one since T-51b was all I used before I got T-65 and since I‚Äôve gotten T-65 I‚Äôve missed the bright headlamp, T-65 doesn‚Äôt have any headlamp mods
---
One 1000 point challenge is the same as seven 250 point challenges to you? 
---
You may want to recheck your math there
---
I love Fallout 1st. The scrap box and the survival tent are both worth it to me. I bought 10 to 20 dollars in Atoms a month anyway, so it's worth it for me just for the Atoms, everything else is a nice bonus to me.
---
Then you get banned for duping.
---
Those are 2 of the things i was talking about, and the thought of it being easier is the fact that no one else would be able to get the key cards/keys/whatever, basically to not need to waste time server hopping thats what I was talking about
---
Oh, sorry for misunderstanding.  Thanks for the correction.
---
.38 rounds right?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
You can get the christmas, halloween and survivors rewards
---
Then I met someone.....a stranger......
---
GARY?!?
---
Yea I just meant the important ones
---
Yup
---
Get well rested, make some cranberry cobbler and do a few Whitespring/Westtek/steakhouse runs that‚Äôs a level up. Yeah it sucks but I‚Äôve been doing it for the challenges.
---
I had no trouble doing the quests on a public server, and I don‚Äôt think keys and stuff are a ‚Äúworld spawn‚Äù item, pretty sure they‚Äôre spawned individually for each player or else certain quests would be broken. So they should be there
---
Yeah I‚Äôm just being my completionist self. Ignore me man. Lol
---
This^. Too be fair most of the rewards are meh too me. Only things that I really want are the camp items but not going to constantly grind or log in just too get them.
---
Damn you got that cluttered look down perfectly! I thought I had been getting better at this by downsizing but wow! This is giving me so many fun ideas for my next camp.
---
Every time i try spamming junk from my stash to my inventory to get rid of some accidental not scrapped items i always get some items from my weapons in my inventory too. Just dont spam and you should be alright
---
I think see needs a few doses of sulfur water, med-x, a couple diffusers and some solar armor healing.
---
Great work on the photos!
---
Sounds good. Maybe ping me then and we will do it
---
I'm honestly amazed they managed to get that potato of an engine to run an online game on consoles at all.
---
Nopr. The only change is Wastelanders added to the amount of encounter types.
---
When Wastelanders happened more events were made, watering down the chance to get good encounters
---
Never give up, never surrender!
---
Ok, thank you
---
I don't talk to them, but I will give them what others gave me at the start-- excess aid, plans, etc. They can follow me around if they want, but if they're persistent for free stuff, it's time for me to visit a Fissure Site to farm some scorchbeasts, or take a leisurely stroll from the Cranberry Bog through the Mire.
---
What level are you?
---
Oh my god, you're a lifesaver, man! I did something similar, and it worked! May whatever's up there bless you a thousand times over.
---
I think they just added new possible encounters there. Making it harder to find the deathclaws/sheepsquatches as there are more possibilities. They still spawn thought as i have encountered them.
---
Fireproof is there to stop me from dying from SB spam, don't have a explosive weapon atm
---
Strange in numbers doesnt activate in a group with one person. Ive tried it myself to test. Class freak 3 however does entirely remove the penalty to your specials outside of a group though.
---
The point is that NONE of this is going to get done because the PvP community is being outright ignored and treated like dirt by everyone, this community and Bethesda included. Everyone who PvP's wants these things fixed, its all we've asked for since survivals termination. And every time we're shot down, trolled, and told to go play NW.
---
World mods yes plan no
---
Hahaha.... Gary?
---
I'm so glad to hear that helped. That can be so frustrating.
---
Also agreed. I enjoy fallout genuinely, I play with a couple friends after work sometimes, I mostly play by myself and have plenty of fun. the community on Reddit blows, I‚Äôll get hate messages, and negative responses and bad energy from people until the post dies out. Glad I said it. Don‚Äôt regret it. Glad I see that other players disagree and see a lot of positive posts; more so glad to see people are enjoying the game. I wonder if people just come here to blow off steam.
---
I tried a little bit for the atoms but i missed most of it so i only got like 300 atoms from this.
---
For the third point, there are perks for big damage buffs to certain weapons, perks for extra health, and higher quality armor, among other things like Med-X, Bobbleheads, magazines, etc.
---
All things equal, that shouldn't happen, so I'd imagine it was a combination of those things mentioned.
---
With all 3 shotgunner perks maxed, demolition expert maxed and bloody mess maxed plus the hardened reciever attached my gauss shotgun does 913 damage?!! Its probably my favorite weapon now lol and I'm still missing one more mod to make it better lmao
---
I'm not too opposed to this idea if they ACTUALLY added the wood corner pieces and misc bits with it. It'll never happen though. They'll just tell us to play FO4 if we want it all.
---
GARY &gt;:(
---
You feed it once and now it stays
---
Then complain to BGS.
---
And police your own community.
---
I have to say I have no interest in in NW. I prefer to play cooperatively with a team so these challenges are just making me want to join it for example to lay down a camp
---
I've literally been attacked while loading into exactly one location-- Eastern Regional Penitentiary.
---
The Welcome Bear (and I'm calling it that from now on, thanks!) has always been pretty far away from the spawn point and it takes him a while to notice me. I usually book it and jump on top of the park sign while shooting.
---
I HAVE been killed because I was scrolling on my phone too long and didn't notice the load screen was gone only to look up as Welcome Bear killed me and leisurely waddled away.
---
Lol ‚Äúplease Bethesda stop with the daily challenge that makes me actually fight enemies. All I wanna do is sit around and decorate my camp.‚Äù Man the player base of this game is ridiculous.
---
It's alot of fun just rubber banding and starting a new game several times while I watch some tv
---
I doubt anyone on this sub would do this, but feels bad man.
---
I just know I'm gonna throw them in my stash and never touch them because the perfect time never comes along
---
I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs the same for flux/plants.
---
I'm not that annoyed, I'm more annoyed by the fact he refused to combat tag me back so I could get it back. Like he knew I'd one tap him he even said in voice chat that I'm not gonna fight you. He's a genuine cunt
---
Trust me, you can still murder people in cold blood.
---
You think we havnt tried? The last time Bethesda responded to PvP was at the AmA before wastelanders. And guess what they told us... go play NW. Its just insulting that was how they responded to us. How would you feel if the roles were reversed? If PvP was getting more attention and content then anything else in this game, you'd be just as upset as we are.
---
This is why I have FO1st for scrap.  Unlimited junk.   Junk is all you drop on death isn‚Äôt it?
---
You can't take what I rightfully stole
---
Get her, Ray!
---
Thanks again üëç
---
My rule of thumb is half the MSRP, rounded to the nearest 5. 
---
The only thing I usually put in at MSRP is Legendaries and I drop those lower usually. Or price them double or triple if I'm looking to hold onto them. (And if some fool wants to spend their caps on something so overpriced, far be it from me to stop them.)
---
I'll do 10-20% if I'm looking to empty my machines.
---
I got the 2 RDO "outlaw passes". There you you buy in just for the privledge to rank up and earn the rewards. So there's a chance you pay that money and not get everything. Yes, I completed it fairly early but it's a possible. 
---
I prefer this system, free to access, purchase ranks if necessary. It's that they "evaluate" it at over $100 that I have a problem with. 
---
Sure, you don't have to pay the whole amount and most won't, pricing it less would likely cause even more people to buy it out, meaning they won't have any reason to play until the next update, and maybe some will only have to pay $10 or $20 at the end which isn't too far off from the outlaw pass price. 
---
Balancing all those issues is a problem, their solution isn't too bad but maybe make it so the whole season cost $60. They probably would make more money.
---
Nah you good...the others are on the list for completion...I have to keep a to do list otherwise my ocd freaks me out when i have 50 plus yellow blinking diamonds on the screen lol
---
Yw üòÅ
---
Nah, I'd just go back to playing Fallout 4.
---
There are plenty of PvP-specific games out there, a lot better than 76. Time to stop pounding square pegs into round holes.
---
Yeah If fallout 1st was cheaper I'd buy it
---
Yes, I use auto stim and lifesaving cause I'm a lazy bastard. Plus if I go down all the npcs just ignore me until I get back up, quite funny when a raider who just slapped me just turns around and walks away and I just sneak up and back stab him.
---
My point is there's better ways to get materials if you need them that bad that you are taking them from other players you are clearly playing the game wrong
---
I keep drowning under my base structure by the water ü§£
---
I agree. Xp for all actions raised and also add xp for doing lockpick/hack as well. Also think final team placement should be the final xp you get. Reward NW players for playing many different ways and squading up proper. Instead its all spawn 300 miles away from each other and hide Bush or jump with frog legs from roof to roof.
---
Can I go back to my original character as I'm slowly Bush wacking to the ghillie suit
---
what skin are you using? some of them make noises/have voice lines
---
Oh ok, I had watched some of the videos that said other players had picked up the items and what not and the person trying to do the task had to hop around to diff servers to get all the items.ok kewl thanx 4 tha info
---
Just a heads up, you can't learn the automatic mod. You have to buy the plan from Wartoga
---
Make sure to collect 250 other items from somewhere else to reset your list.  Also open 65 containers somewhere else
---
This is why I just loot all the world junk as I clear ares to reset my looted list so as I revisit areas it‚Äôs reset
---
I don‚Äôt remember the exact number that stays on your list but it‚Äôs FIFO. First in first out.  So as you loot other areas the last area falls off your list
---
Just loot everything. Scrap all junk at a work bench.  Stash what you need bulk/drop what you don‚Äôt
---
With this method.  I‚Äôm never short for crafting.  Repairs.  Or bulk scrap to sell for caps if I‚Äôm in a hurry
---
FO1st subscription is a qol that pays for its self in atoms
---
They often use bypass exploits to get around the silo faster than a normal player can.  That's how they manage to get to Launch Prep without opening the Mainframe Core doors or lowering forcefields.  Launch Prep is still the main gating mechanism, and what usually happens is that while you're dealing with the robots, they'll sneak in and plant themselves by the console.
---
You really just have to play defensively, even if you think you're alone.  Even though they can sneak the whole time, check the map periodically to see if there's someone in the silo.  Listen carefully for robots or explosives that aren't around you.  And as Launch Prep winds down, gravitate over to the console.
---
I have heard that one way you can counter them is to cut in front of the process.  Technically, *any* person is able to use the targeting scope to launch a missile the moment the keypad detects a valid code.  So, as I understand it, if they slide a nuclear keycard and start the process, you just have to monopolize the targeting scope.  They'll have to move away to interact with the keypad, even if they had previously input the number earlier in the week.
---
Also they swapped skiing outfit plan spawn to the mire and the Halloween outfits to the divide, so if you're looking for those..
---
&gt;work after switching the refresh rate from 300hz to 60hz.
---
did you ffix it ? i have the same problem
---
I have so be careful not guarnteed a friend is safer
---
There‚Äôs more than 3
---
That and looting all the ammo from every crate even if it's something you won't use.
---
only if the ones who sing horribly can be shot in the head to silence them.
---
Well that‚Äôs what it seems to me by the one I live by.
---
This.  This is most likely how your displayed items are getting scrapped.  Have to be careful if you stay on a world your camp cant spawn into as it counts displayed items as stashed items while you're there.
---
I just ignore them. I have team speak on mute since I play solo anyhow and if they offer up a trade I don't take it. I'll drop the occasional plan or low level armor near a newbie but then just move on. I also don't feel like this is a newbie-centric issue, this is being a greedy, obnoxious player problem. Doesn't matter the game, these types of people will act like this regardless.
---
Tip for anyone trying this.. stay out of third person and keep long guns stowed because you will clip visibly through the walls.
---
It's always the baseline skins for normal PA, and I've noticed it's a universal noise

So it's a battle of wits...pour the wine...

It should be a weekly, NW could use a weekly. I don't get the "Just make an alt" thing, you shouldn't have to! I'd like to progress towards rank 100 doing the other challenges so I can get the rest of the unlocks! 
---
The other challenges are doable and fair but not 'rank up', should be a weekly worth 1000 points. Gives those that love NW more points to earn while those of us that suck don't get forced to play it for a long boring session of bush wookie
---
its crazy we have to ask for this...
---
That would be cool
---
I think the point B..Mike is making is that Adventure players are the ones paying for and completing the seasons.  Not only are the rewards orientated for this the grind is as well. Fallout 1st and the atom shop support the game in this late stage and it is substantially set up to cater to Adventure mode.  Therefore we / B..Mike is making the point that being forced to play additional time in NW to get rewards for Adventure mode is not a way to get those who pay for NW mode to want engage with it.  What might work better is to have 9 SCORE challenges that you could choose which mode to complete them in.  Example, level up in NW or Adventure mode .. how would that be a bad thing?  I would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this üôÇ
---
ah, i think you are talking about the normal walking sounds. i know the Northern Lights T-51 paint has jingle bells that ring when you walk. if you are on PC there may be a mod for removing the walking sound. or you could play with your volume settings
---
I'd pay actual atom points to get this event.
---
It's incredibly dumb to me that they didn't have it apply to all the new human NPCs.  It's so obvious, and yet...
---
I've never played it because Im not a fan of battle royal. That being said, personal opinions on a game or a games features don't make that game or its features inherently bad. Your personal preferences make it bad for YOU.
---
Yeah, you select the character you want to play and then select the game mode.
---
Brah, like, go back to the hole you came from
---
and how do you find them, Im teleporting all around the map chacking shops and I havent seen a single serum for sale
---
GAAAAAARY
---
It's a survival game. You expect manners and niceties?
---
Also: stop carrying junk on you. Lol
---
I have also moved my camp to no luck, hopefully this is just a client side bug
---
This seems to be pretty easy.i seem to find more legendaries just by roaming the map from a to b
---
For me, the only time Life Saving was a thing was back when Vault 94 existed.  Since dying resulted in you getting booted out of the Vault and having to start over, there was at least some reason to maybe have one piece of it.
---
A Colossal Problem may end up being similar, because I think it's structured like a raid boss.
---
Troubleshooter also has some excuse for being useful at Encryptid.  Exterminator was also arguably useful in the same Vault 94 raid, since most of its enemies met that criteria (and you had to deal with a *lot* of them).  But, outside of some very specific instances like that, species-specific gear is worthless.  No one is going to be carrying around multiple sets of armor for different enemies.
---
The season rank 66 reward c.a.m.p. item is bugged and breaks it if you are using it.
---
They took away our atoms for garbage most don't want. That's my point
---
Nah, I'm on console, that's why I'm wondering if there's a way to make just that noise quieter or remove it.   
---
W: Mods for Console, c'mon Bethesda
---
He looks so happy
---
That would be nice.
---
False stealing from corpses is the fastest way of farming, especially if they just farmed. Let me guess you were one of the players that complained that in Sea of Thiefs other players took your stuff.
---
I've been running into a load of people leaving plans in more common routes. When I started out that was great, now I try to continue it.
---
Playing old holotapes of the Unstoppables, Vault Tech propaganda, West Tek commercials, etc... 
---
Lots of fun possibilities.
---
Wards daily vital equipment.  It has the best rewards in the game at 3 treasury notes and 11 scrip for fast traveling twice and killing one mob.  And sometimes you dont even have to do that, the thief is either already dead or the item is just laying there on the ground thanks to server lag.
---
Most fun though is dross toss.  Especially if you have fire in the hole equipped.  Wish more of the games worked at Camden Park honestly.
---
Lol send me your gt.would like some extra 5.56 to add to the 5k that I already have.
---
Wouldn't change the amount you would travel only because your a high lvl doesn't mean you have anything decent find a lot of vendors are full of crappy 3stars or ammo or other stuff that is really easy to come by
---
It's hard to tell what's going on in the photos
---
Leaving stuff built increases the cost to claim the workshop though.
---
Doesn't stop me from abandoning my workshops with heaps of random floor decorations though. So to anyone reading this, if you had to pay 75 caps to claim a workshop with a pile of 200 alpine horn guys, sorry about that, it's funny to me.
---
this event would be super satisfying, but i wish it was beckett haha.
---
I‚Äôve seen Cultist,Blood Raiders,prison marshals and of course the damn Yao guai chasing radstags. Meg‚Äôs raiders just gives no f‚Äôs that day or any üòÇ
---
Ah, I see, thanks for the heads up, I‚Äôll change it
---
Just to follow up on the entitled bit... Adventure mode players are paying for the game at this stage with fallout 1st and the atom shop both of which are not used in NW... So yeah, we you could call it entitled, or just the desire to get our monies worth.
---
Same type of people who one shot legendaries at events.
---
Also recently returned. Just curious - why do most builds require 5 luck? Are there universal mandatory perks in luck? I'm guessing bloody mess and something else?
---
I wouldnt have to carry junk if the scrapbox wasn't locked behind a paywall
---
Whenever I see things like this, I'm just like amazed. I just built my "forever" camp but like... now I wanna change everything.
---
There was one many many moons ago.  It was removed.   It probably won't be added back because people with trap camps would take advantage of it.
---
See this is why I come back here every day.
---
Yes seriously I hate that one so much. I don't even do it lol
---
Nah didn't complain in see of theifs. But if you're going to steal from someone at least have the balls to enter combat with them so they can get their stuff back
---
Why? Cause you can‚Äôt AFK to complete it? You have to actually participate to achieve? Aww.
---
I think the buffs have been removed, I recently went from carnivore to herbivore. A day after I changed, canned meat stew stopped giving me any benefit. Also, I now don't get any of the stat boosts from the various scorchbeasts meats.
---
Its like feeding a stray cat...
---
Correct. But you get bigger buffs from your chosen side with strange in numbers. 
---
I'm carnivore, and get 7.5 int from scorchbeast brains, as well as similar luck and end buffs from other SB parts, though I have cut off my old go to of corn soup. 
---
On balance, it I could be bothered, I'd rather go Herbivore instead and use cranberry cobbler etc for big buffs and easy food/water as they're much easier to come across overall and grow at your own camp. Though you still need to go get cranberries the same as SB's. I think the general idea is that carnivore is best for melee, and herbivore for everything else. 
---
I don't think I'm missing out massively, but for me it would be more convenient and take less effort being herb than carn. Having said that, feed the people/surface to air events give you good results as a carn, and berry mentats give an extra boost alongside path to enlightenment. 
---
I've finished the legendary run so I'm definitely biased now I'm out of the grind, and for me personally it'd be much better using corn soup for food and water at the same time from my own camp than the carn stuff. YMMV.
---
# Number 1 rule of the waste land: DON'T DIE
---
No email or anything. Anybody else get rebanned???
---
To the lads playing good samaritans, I appreciated it  back when I was low-level.
---
Got some upgrades to guns(long-scope was a must...used to it from previous Fallouts) and armour(deep pockets). Got a bit of help in the odd quest...but some of this you're talking about is nuts. You're helping these people way too much.
---
The two guys who helped me lots I was giving them stuff back eventually too. Rare drops at events I might have got lucky on and didn't want...straight to my buddy journeyman. A legendary I didn't need but knew they might find useful...straight to them.
---
Sounds like some of you lads are allowing these asshats to take advantage of you all.
---
Sometimes you can't help that thought tbf. It's annoying but if someone else shoots a legendary it loses its glowing affect so if you aren't reading names you can easily accidentally 1tap them
---
It is a cool idea but they have a lot more important things that I hope they are focusing on.
---
Well, that would take the fun out of spawning on the edge of a cliff, in the middle of irradiated water, or clipped into a structure and getting stuck.
---
Man they should hire you lol. 
---
This is just lovely done
---
I just want junk walls with a lil edit to make them snappable
---
I wouldn't die if the game didn't have this weird as fuck bug where if enemies are shooting me it stores that damage then puts on me all at once and 1shots me through buffs like serendipity and nerdrage
---
Jetpack is 10 less carry weight. I can whip out some power armor if I need to fly.
---
Thanks very much
---
Yeah that was the cause.
---
so frackin annoying. happens to me during project paradise as well.
---
By the looks of the dislikes you got alot of people on this sub would do this XD
---
The type you are not mutated for will not grant health or satiate your food/water. They still provide the base 1x bonus associated though.
---
So there's squirrel stew and cranberry relish. One will give 25% (with herd mentality) and the other 10%. So it adds up the same no matter if your a meat or plant eater.
---
There are certain foods that are exclusive though, such as meats that boost melee damage, there isn't a plant equivalent so if you want to melee you will want to go carnivore for the double effectiveness.
---
Yup, seems it‚Äôs the FutureTec Camp skin that hides the map marker, thanks for the help, hopefully that gets fixed cause it‚Äôs got a nice look to it
---
How is one day of score going to ruin your pathway to Lvl 100? You have like 6 more weeks or so lol.
---
Righteous
---
Exactly how I roll in rumble.  Amazing how many peeps collect zero.  TBF it‚Äôs great for XP farming
---
Then they go complain about losing score everyday. That sucks but kinda feels like karma to me.
---
The math is already done I thought. You can‚Äôt miss more than 3 or 4 days of dailies or your definitely not getting it and I haven‚Äôt done any of the nw challenges unless it‚Äôs the camp one
---
True, but I have seen guys run up and 1 shot, first shot.  I don‚Äôt do it, though I‚Äôm more then capable of doing so.  
---
I have also had someone stand over my loot, I don‚Äôt like it, but if I die it is usually my fault for not paying attention.
---
yeah I made only a post cuz I didnt find nothing about it figured I'd ask then IG was talking to a friend and eir told me it happened to someone else and the skin was the only thing that was changed.
---
And this is like 4 regular days of score they fucked me out of which is half a week
---
I'd be one of those peeps, I've gotten a few rewards, but mostly from Incidental completion.
---
I guess i explained it incorrectly mr. Robot what i ment is we all have a weakness that someone else can play off of ....and when its a corp. With a shit ton of people trying to exploit the weakness of othera there is a problem there  yes?
---
I've noticed a growing trend where people are placing their companions in small buildings far from the center of their camp.  That's one way to shut them up.
---
You don't need to loot anything at all to sit(afk) in a bush. I should know, that's the only way I play NW.
---
I use my private server to transfer items between characters and do some quests.
---
That‚Äôs not true. You absolutely can miss more than 3-4 dailies. You are still on track (actually a little ahead of schedule if you are at 56). 
---
Anyway yes you keep emotes. Yes you Lee scrap box but can no longer add to it.
---
To be on track you should be level 55 by EOD tomorrow. 
---

---
Hanging Raider Cage is surprising great. You can plant a bazillion of them in workshops to make a spooky forest.
---
That‚Äôs me.  Not easy when the bitch won‚Äôt land cos everyone is shooting plasma
---
I carry a tag pistol around with me for events like uranium fever just so I can avoid 1shotting things. I use the come here emote too.
---
well, uranium fever is great, also leader of the pack if they are active. ws golf club rarely disappoints, neither does west tek. going down to watoga to spot legendary sb's is also a good tactic.
---
I love how people who complain about losing score but then they don't grind to make up for it. I've had the score glitch happen 3 times and everytime I was like ok so that's just a few hours of grinding to make up for it.
---
Its upon death, not being knocked down. So that doesn't work.
---
Alright then. It really ruined my drive to even play for today though appreciate the response
---
That one doesn't count for the challenge, though.
---
You sir are amazing
---
This games a fucking joke
---
Starched genes 2 so you don't lose mutations and class freak 3 so you the negative effects are reduced.
---
Isn‚Äôt a behemoth canonically unable you get diseases like the scorch?
---
I usually tried to keep at least 5 gum around back when there was a daily atom challenge to "chew 5 pieces of bubblegum" I got to know where to get them on a fairly usual basis. Couple in Flatwoods, usually a couple out at the fairgrounds next to the racetrack workshop, in the shed closest to the road with the halloween stuff in it, usually in one of the baskets.
---
If you want to use both meats and veggies but pick a mutation then pop a rad-x eat the food you normally can't because of your mutation because it will be suppressed and then pop a diluted radx so you get your mutation back. Easy way to still get all benefits from food.
---
You can... they just have only one side that looks good. I am shit at building but I just make a double house, where one side is a normal home and the attached wall divided metal garage holds all the crafting benches. The downside is you gotta deal with one interior and one exterior side, but door walls and doors are useable inside too.
---
Me too, 10mm sub!
---
I‚Äôd say 6
---
you select the level 1 card first
---
??
---
Should be it
---
I know. I‚Äôm saying we need walls we can put wallpapers on both sides of.
---
I just use gaus
---
Thank you for the ideas.
---
exploit. And apparently you can never delete them from your budget
---
I think you can buy them from Phoenix bot in Watoga or the BOS bot at whitesprings.
---
Does the login screen say you are banned? Did you receive the email? Have you checked that its simply not connecting for any other reason? - I logged in to a 'no entry' code that others have labelled as 'proof' they are banned, except it was a network/server related issue and simply required a retry.
---
One time I a shot a player to get their attention cuz I wanted to give them a gift but instead they killed me and stole my shit
---
There was one day i managed to do abot 70% of that days dailys before I even left my camp.

---
Yep I‚Äôm in the process of making a melee. Only another 27 levels to go
---
Yep I wouldn't do it, even if you delete it by starting a new camp you still lose the camp budget it took up permanently.
---
Its over 9000!!!
---
Yeah, I'm still not to the point that spending a few thousand caps wouldn't wipe me out.  I think they're 3k?
---
Ah yes. I remember when I used to complain about people stealing my loot. 
---
If you die. For whatever reason, and you‚Äôre near me, I will take it. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre my friend, then I‚Äôll stand on top and guard it. Or if there are other people nearby I‚Äôll pick it up and give it back to my friend. 
---
It‚Äôs a concept that you simply have to get used to. If you‚Äôre low on junk materials and you see an empty bag on the floor. You know damn well you‚Äôre going to take it. Doesn‚Äôt matter if a person dropped it because they didn‚Äôt want it. Another player killed them. Or they died from an enemy and had to respawn somewhere else. Free lot is free loot. 
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem in it. Just like when you kill an enemy and steal their loot, same concept goes for players. 
---
You could try to initiate a fight to have a chance at fighting them and winning your loot back. But chances are they are in pacifist. You could try messaging the person yourself. Cursing them or kindly asking for it back. But they still decide if they want to be nice and give it back. Or simply tell you to go away and they will keep your loot. 
---
Or they might never even get the message because they have their privacy settings differently. 
---
At the end of the day, you lost your loot. Keep playing the game and farm more junk. Try to kill people and hope that you win and you‚Äôre able to take their stuff. Or try to hang around other players and hope something kills them.
---
Congrats! Also amazing photos, I'm level 95 and I can't wait to get to level 100
---
Oh haha alright thanks, was really confused, saw they had tons of ammo for sale and then the ammo factories explained why but didn‚Äôt know how they got them
---
I think they are around 5000 caps at a vendor
---
Did you buy a year of fallout 1st?
---
I remember that quest! She spawns a horde of Astronauts to kill everything that moves. I have no idea how she found all those Astronauts or why they are so angry, but whatever.
---
Funny thing is - they all complain about headaches.
---
Just port everything from fo4 500 atoms
---
A bunch of us started playing at release so we helped each other out. We had one guy in our,group who only wanted to farm legendarys. At first we were helping repair his stuff and helping him out a lot. We were all the same level roughly and we never asked for anything. A couple of times when we asked him for help or if he'd give us a weapon he got that he had no use for he'd ask for caps in payment. We ended up just ignoring him till he got the hint. And we constantly helped him when we all started.
---
It's a nice one to have for any sneaky player.
---
It's a momentary Stealth Boy effect, activated when you crouch.  If you manage to break line-of-sight with whatever has aggro'ed on you and crouch with Escape Artist, there's a very good chance they'll lose you and go back to \[CAUTION\].
---
I did I got the important stuff back. I also orbital strike beaconed his base which caused him to quit the server so I'm counting this as a win for me
---
Secret Service armor doesn't currently have any mods that improve stealth. Buttressed is the ONLY choice for slot 1 until they add Shadowed. Torso choices are Jetpack, Jetpack, or Jetpack. Arm choices don't make a difference. I prefer Custom Fit on all my leg armors, Muffled and Sleek *should* be beneficial to stealth but Escape Artist nullifies the former and Speed Demon the latter(there's a miniscule difference but it's not worth the slots).
---
Why would I want to change your mind about something that is obviously true.
---
That is like saying "Tomato Ketchup is red, change my mind"
---
Yeah that happens. Honestly pvp is so jank.
---
I love the jetpack and SS armor but if you are running stealth armor just ignore.
---
The gauntlet and gauss shotgun are 2 good if not great items you can buy from Foundation. The gauntlet has the 2nd best unarmed damage behind the power fist. The gauss shotgun is best in class.
---
The armco ammo machine you get from Crater at max rank is awesome too. It just passively creates ammo. No mats needed. Just enter the type on the terminal and collect.
---
If you are running sneak you might look into thorn armor from Regs. It has a sneak bonus built in and you can roll legendary variants. 
---
The SS under armor with the Shielded mod is best in class as far as I'm concerned but you really only neef it if you run traditional armor. 
---
Good luck!!
---
Man, if someone would come buy my 5.56, I could get there.
---
I don't really feel like there's much problem with the gameplay itself, just with the slow matchmaking and the bare bones matchmaking setup. 
---
I wish they'd make the vault a team/solo location where you can stay for an infinite time after selecting NW in the menu so you have lots of time to set up perks and explore the place. Have it keep an active matchmaking lobby list the whole time, and have it so the players can ready-up in their pipboys and be queued into the best lobby match immediately from there, with a max of a 60 second wait from ready-up to map voting (shorten map vote to 10 seconds and force it on screen) and deployment. Then after that match concludes have the option to return to the vault instead of spectating but keep the current matchmaking lobby, or quit to vault and exit lobby, and if you win or spectate to end of match have it put you right back into the 60 second timer with your current lobby for a new match.
---
I can't imagine they haven't thought to do it this way though, so either they don't have the spare people to make it happen, or there's some technical limitation I'm unaware of, or some technology they don't own the rights to use that's needed for such a system.
---
Well yeah but if I get close to the end that way I'm not hoping for a win
---
Yeah I just wish it wasn‚Äôt locked behind a pay wall of some sort and a time constraint to obtain it too
---
Sounds like it needs a squirt of WD40! ü§£
---
Orbital strikes work even if in pacifist? Good to know. I might have found a use for whenever I see trap camps.
---
A lot of people seem to be burned out by it. For me it's a bit of a relief as I can play other games after finishing up my daily and weekly challenges.
---
You are not the only one!!!
---
Ya, just keep saving. After 1200 plus hours I've never gotten them as a drop or found the plan in the wild. 
---
If you are on xbox I can mod them for you if you have the flux.
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
I have level 88 lol, a lot of ppl already did Lvl 100 the legit way. Stack XP buffs and do events and stuff.
---
He might not have been in pacifist I just know the orbital strike beacon worked on his base
---
there's a guy on I think Japanese servers with an actual factory of them, like a 5 storie tall 5√ó5 complex of just ammo factories
---
Agreed. It was just a way to add more prizes imo. The problem with the rewards are they don't always fit your camp or character build.
---
On a sidenote... RDO gets a big new content patch in two days. Just in time. I'm bored af playing FO76.
---
Not everybody who plays 76 wants to/can play cyberpunk, it's not like they're going to lose their entire playerbase overnight
---
I made a new character and its easy on low levels
---
You mean like the jackolanterns and racks? or did people figure out a way to sell atom shop camp items?
---
Nope, you're not alone! I thought the same thing.
---
Understood
---
Right and I get that, but it just screams laziness to me. And after their launch with 76 laziness isn‚Äôt something they can afford and keep in mind I‚Äôm a huge Bethesda fan as well
---
See for me, I find it hard for me to make caps. I find myself either doing the daily side quests, daily challenges, or just selling everything I don't need that I pick up from enemies to make caps. üôÅ
---
This happens to me all the time at Poseidon too. I started going onto the rooftops so I can snipe them from within the event zone. Frustrating.
---
Ya I agree.
---
Fed 76..?? I've never heard of it.
---
Alien Blaster has a 42 ammo capacity. It's the magic number in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. (sorry if this one's a bit too obvious, but I got a good laugh out of it.)
---
(I've never seen a Flatwoods Monster, Alien, or Mothman, much less killed one.)
---
Id rather it just be play 1 match to the end, that way you cant just suicide at spawn and may slightly encourage some to try
---
To be fair. I'm already in aquamarine and it's not even August yet. (sorry to casual players) but the nw ones aren't necessarily needed thanks to them adden what 4 or 5 extra challenges.
---
It'll do it when you're trying to pull stuff from your stash box too.
---
This never happens.
---
Like the Halloween skull mask and some kind of plans I cant remember when I'm not playing
---
It‚Äôs easy do it on a new character u level up fast i have over level 100 a level 65 characters and  a two in the 30s I don‚Äôt really use at also have a level 2 I‚Äôve been using for this as of lately
---
It would be great if we had ultralight build.
---
Agreed 110 pct on the jetpack!!
---
why arent wooden stairs a thing to begin with anyway give me multiple types of wooden stairs.
---
130 AUD is a year's subscription to F1st

There is more you can do, but these are the 3 that are worth the most:
---
To change the **Pip-Boy** color
---
Open the **Fallout76Prefs.ini** (this does not work in the custom.ini for whatever reason)
---
Search for the \[Pipboy\] column and change the values:
---
    fPipboyEffectColorR=1.0000 
---
    fPipboyEffectColorG=0.8860 
---
    fPipboyEffectColorB=0.6230 
---
For the **Quick-Boy** or "Holographic Pip-Boy" Color
---
Open the **Fallout76Custom.ini**
---
Search for the \[Pipboy\] column and add the following lines:
---
    fQuickBoyEffectColorR=1.0000 
---
    fQuickBoyEffectColorG=0.8860 
---
    fQuickBoyEffectColorB=0.6230 
---
For the **Power Armor** Display
---
    fPAEffectColorR=1.0000 
---
    fPAEffectColorG=0.8860 
---
    fPAEffectColorB=0.6230
---
If I were new to the game I wouldn't be doing it. The main quests are way more worth the time than grinding XP for cosmetics.
---
Most people after they get past level 200 or so just run out of stuff to do between content drops, which has been dry since wastelanders, so this is the only thing left unfinished for them.
---
I notice nothing on the screaming eagle. People say clipping but I don't see it. Something about the sights but I don't see it either. I have a dot sight. The gold skin, I reported that to them with screenshots an comparisons to the vanilla skin and the matte black skin. They never fixed it still. Gave tons of evidence to them.
---
I made a character just for their stupid battle pass since leveling up is often a challenge and trying to level up my main which is level 160 something is pretty grindy. I'm using that character to do these stupid rank ups in Nuclear Winter. It's a lot faster then my rank 81. I can usually rank up in one round (I'm rank 2 now so...that may change later on).
---
Agreed. I like fo76 and BRs but this mode is trash. Forever between games. Always feels clunky and you are rewarded for hiding in a bush over actually trying to win or kill people.
---
It has to be a blip on the Bethesda radar though don‚Äôt you think.   I will be playing Cyberpunk but I am also hoping Bethesda will have something planned to spice things up and give me a good reason to return to wander the wasteland.
---
Yea it‚Äôs kinda crazy they charge money for these and don‚Äôt release them complete or even fix em. The screaming eagle mag while reloading clips your hand. That‚Äôs the most noticeable thing for me
---
Do you want to? 
---
Queen of the hunt daily can bring you face to face with a flatwoods monster. And if you have raider punk in your camp he can send you to kill the mothman i believe.
---
Personally, I think NW is just a glorified hide and seek game because of all the bush wookies (like me).
---
But I bet you scare the ever loving piss out of em
---
I don't get angry so much as i do be 'on edge',  i'll end up shooting a blade of grass just for moving lol
---
yeah, there's definitely people that dont care for the grind
---
Gotten a single god roll weapon from mama Murphy. A three star weapon from the Queen...ever lol
---
Gee I dunno how does a free DLC featuring The return of the brotherhood sound
---
Microsoft + Bethesda = DISASTER
---
What can they do? I say they just keep with the schedule. They shouldn't rush out anything just because a hyped up game is coming out.
---
That‚Äôs actually pretty rad üòÉ
---
Same here. Disconnected on log on and challenges gone
---
I like this suggestion. I‚Äôd be up for being a ghoul.
---
Oh yes, every single thing I've bought from her I've sold back at a loss.  Absolutely nothing worth keeping.
---
Maybe it has something to do with bigger mags. I use piercing magazine and rifleman build an I do notice some minor clipping but it's barely noticeable. It could be the pov is set higher on pc settings cause consoles don't have pov settings.
---
Top tips them, ta.  Shall give them a whirl.
---
For the screaming eagle, the mags clip with your hand. It‚Äôs because it uses the exact animations for the handmade, but the position of the mag/mag well are further back on the service rifle. For most of the mags it‚Äôs very hard to see unless you‚Äôre actually looking, but with the drum mag you can definitely notice it.
---
That guy likely wasn't cheating or anything, just perked out well and maybe got lucky with some chem or bobblehead finds.
---
Cheaters/hackers will be obvious, they usually hang out in one spot with a teammate and just start killing everyone on the map regardless of their location just by firing their weapon. I've been encountering these people less and less lately, maybe because of the number of people playing the mode to do challenges now.
---
Well I myself have put the game aside many times,but I came back.
---
I guess this is very individual,but I personally don‚Äôt play games for their superb gameplay,achievements or collections.I play them for the atmosphere and story,for the characters and the universe.I mean I do play (or rather used to play) things like CS and Battlefield,but that‚Äôs because it might have been with friends or I just wanted to blow off some steam in a casual (or competitive for CS) game to relax myself.
---
I treat single player games like a book or a movie.Fallout is probably my most favorite series of games.I like the lore,I like exploration,I like the characters and most importantly I like the atmosphere the games give out.It‚Äôs like an interactive book or a movie,that‚Äôs why I usually try to play as myself in most situations and do the choices I‚Äôd do.That‚Äôs what makes Fallout enjoyable for me.The stories and lore make me think just like a good book does.And I‚Äôm really into the atmosphere and old music.
---
Now 76 is a lot of things,but great ain‚Äôt one of them.I dislike the grind,I dislike the atomic shop and the bugs,but I like Fallout.I have done all the quests in the game (excluding the boring repeatable ones) and I have pretty much gone through everything except the grind.But there is no other fallout to play.I have gone through 3 and New Vegas countless times.The games are still enjoyable,but there is nothing new there,same mods,locations and quests.Fallout 4 is basically the same,but a bit more boring.1 and 2 were a bit of a pain to go through,but I have seen pretty much most of them too (albeit some just on video).
---
Reading a good book makes me imagine the story,basically like a in-my-head movie.And playing Fallout makes me do something similar.I imagine my character jumping into that T-51b and absolutely wrecking that SBQ with his .50 Browning.But I imagine that while doing it in game.I basically reverse engineer the book experience out of the visual experience,if you can understand that.Whenever I don‚Äôt feel like doing it I just don‚Äôt play the game,because I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it.I‚Äôm not there for the game,I‚Äôm there for the world that I can work with in my mind.
---
I hope this long ass reply was at least a bit interesting and helped you understand a little better.
---
Welcome to Micromanagement Madness 76
---
This is why it shouldn't be so hard to pvp people.
---
Oh ok those were just rewards from limited time events, not atom shop stuff.
---
What's wrong with that guy? You help him a couple of times then all he's doing is being flirty with you ... and I never picked a single flirty option with him. Glad I finished his quest line to get this weirdo out of my fine establishment.
---
Just logged in to the game.
---
Logging in now
---
There‚Äôs lots of camps, train stations, and red rockets around Appalachia friend.
---
Tissues are on aisle 7
---
I hear ya. I've got a good headset as well, play without the radio (a bit too repetitive after so many hours) or ambient music, and get pretty engrossed in everything.
---
The first time I saw one was while I was in the swamp and really low level for everything there. Saw them slinking around through my scope and it was pretty unnerving, especially mixed with the gloomy atmosphere of the area. I'm sitting there watching the 2 of them, unscope, and get "clever girl'd" by another one galloping at me from the side. Scared the the absolute crap out of me and I dreaded going back to get my junk bag.
---
Another time I was sneaking around in some building, assassinating ghouls and wondering what that persistent raspy breathing I kept hearing was. Turned a corner and BAM glowing wendigo right there. I about yelled.
---
OOoooo put it on the cooking channel! Maybe it could even be a feature that if you sit there and watch it, you learn some recipes.
---
the queen of the hunt is a random cryptid so if you find one that isn't a flatwoods monster you can just relog without killing it and keep doing it until you get one. 
---
For a couple of weeks one spawned near my camp several times. it mind controlled my collectron.
---
How many ply are they? I only use 3-ply.
---
I can't even get more tokens cause Zoe is bugged for me and I can't talk to her so I am not able to finish the quest. Tried contacting the support but they weren't really helpful either :/
---
I don‚Äôt pay any attention to it. I just play like I normally do, and I‚Äôve reached rank 36 I think? I have a certain way I like to play, and anything like dailies just makes me not enjoy the game. So if i happen to get something done that overlaps with the legendary run, great. If not I do t really care. Doesn‚Äôt help that most of the rewards of ethics season aren‚Äôt that great.
---
42
---
You can always do it for one month load up your scrap box then unsubscribe.  You can take items out just can‚Äôt put in.  Way to free up stash space and not feel like you have to carry junk. Makes death a little less stressful 
---
But I get it if money‚Äôs tight.  Just throwin an idea out there.   Not every one knows you keep your scrap stash if u unsubscribe
---
Unless your a legacy player it's impossible to have pulled single Lv.1 Perk Cards like Lockpick,Hacking,Green Thumb etc now from Perk Card Packs since the ability to do so was patched out months ago. 
---
But to answer your question no the game doesn't keep tracks of your duplicates what you see is what you get if it says you got x3 First Aid Lv.1 Cards than that's all you have. 
---
If you really want to save your cards than I suggest you stop opening Perk Card Packs until Patch 22 in September.
---
the dialogue between him and his brother or whatever was enough for me to delete his bar haha
---
Still working.
---
I‚Äôve read I am Legend already. Good call
---
Of all those which would you say is the closest to a fallout-like universe?
---
You know you can pick perk cards?   After level 50.
---
OP said nothing about normal adventure mode leveling challenges. Did you even read?
---
Hell no. Your prices are your prices and if people dont.like it they can go farm them damn selves. Ill spend 100 caps gladly if I needed it because I know how hard the shit is to farm
---
You can pick a perk every level, no RNG. Open up your perk menu and pick "choose a perk".
---
Might be easier to find the mods (one of the vendors spells them but I don't remember which one, it's about 350 caps)
---
Any of those particularly similar to a fallout like universe? Retrofuturism etc.
---
That's just bad game design and people are exploiting it. I would mind losing my junk in survival mode because I know I can fight person who took it or destroy their fucking base but in regular adventure mode it's fucking bullshit.
---
People who steal other's shit should become wanted.
---
I just create a new character for those challenges then delete them after about 5 levels. I don't have time to level up my level 140 main every day, but grabbing a perk card pack and exiting the vault, doing Fertile Soil once or twice, and grabbing a workshop are all quick and easy ways to level up a freshie. Same with playing a single match and bushwookie-ing the whole time.
---
I think even easier, don‚Äôt take herbivore or carnivore. And be able to benefit both sides
---
Tried 3 caps a piece. It kinda moved. Tried two caps a piece and it sold out within 30 min.
---
Lol. Well, I don't know if it's totally bugged or a fuck up from the french translation, but I convinced him to spare his brother then, when I met him at the camp to finish the quest, he mentionned Ronny took care of the funerals ...? Most of his dialogues through the quest line are bugged so it's hard to build up any empathy towards him.
---
You can *always* pick perk cards, as long as you meet the level requirement. No perk has a level requirement above 50, so OP should be able to choose from any of them.
---
IIRC the fix is already up on the PTS so it should be coming with Patch 21.
---
Loss of vision is a sign late stage radiation sickness. Next is coma, followed by organ failure and death
---
This gets posted 5x a day
---
Its an exploit..like how FO1 members exploit Line in the Sand  or people using PA exploits for an easy silo run
---
At the end of the day
---
did this persons ammo camp ruin your gameplay?
---
Downvotes but no answer
---
Youre all loving when people glitch thru an drop 3 nukes in a row
---
but this ammo camp has you all nuts
---
Or maybe some people are not interested in PvP.
---
PA is for stomp arounds. SS is best armor. 
---
And PA is 10 carry weight. Your argument cancels itself out.
---
literally just happened to me yesterday
---
I mean there's no point not taking one or the other since you get double the benefit if you do, especially useful during double xp weekends.
---
Shameful and painful to admit, and please don't tell Bethesda, but I've never duped.
---
I hang my head...(to hide my grin!)
---
You know it‚Äôs bad when you can do leader of the pack with the target icons bugged and not appearing on your compass
---
Chekhov?
---
And while they're at it, make it so you can increase/lower that boundary direction. Wouldn't believe how much space gets wasted underground when you place your camp.
---
I was fine in rad, i was using radaway and x, all the chems
---
I want spiral stairs, please!
---
I don't really like doing any of the NW stuff for SCORE. But if I just got to put a tent down it'll be worth the 10 minutes of loading in time...
---
Whooosh
---
Oh yeah, I picked up herbivore for double XP but then dumped it as soon as it was over. I don‚Äôt have either mutation on either of my toons. That‚Äôs just me though
---
Drop int to 3 to grab rejuvenated in endurance and  strange in numbers in charisma
---
Yeah rad rumble you get so many, only a few minutes.
---
Ultracite what? Ore? Sellers market. You can list things for whatever you like. Noone is beholden to buy and it's your own stash space you're clogging up if you're overpricing. 
---
I will say that I have about 1600 ultracite mainly from just killing endless scorchbeasts and picking up the odd bits around the fissure sites and from Breach and Clear. 
---
I tried selling it for 12 a piece once, and got nothing. It's not really worth the stash space or the effort to sell I feel, and honestly if you're selling it at that price you're never gonna sell any unless you hit the pefect storm of someone with 28000 caps or more needing to buy something to stop their limit. 
---
Having said that, for one people shouldn't care that much to complain, and you shouldn't care enough to need to make a post. It's a mundane pointless interaction and situation.
---
All my spots are full with level 100+s
---
All three being patched or?
---
I too have zero interest in this game mode.
---
I like both game modes and I appreciate being able to get SCORE from both. I get where you are coming from and if they hadn‚Äôt increased the number of daily challenges, I would think that it‚Äôs detrimental to people who don‚Äôt like NW.
---
The thing is, the same way that you don‚Äôt want to play NW in your remaining time, I want to be able to get SCORE from more NW challenges, at least have of them should be in this game mode. However, we don‚Äôt always get what we want. 
---
Imagine being a company that has thousands of customers and trying to please every single one of them. It can‚Äôt happen. 
---
All we can do from our end is just see things from another perspective
---
Would have been cool if your character progressively got more ghoulish as their rads increased. A missed opportunity I guess, doubt they'll change anything at this point.
---
If you give a mouse a stimpack , they‚Äôre gonna ask for a legacy to wash it down with.  *fact*
---
Lvl 420 and haven‚Äôt killed the queen according to my challenges.
---
I don't craft alot using ultracite so I'm sitting on about 250? Maybe a little more. I'm with this guy should I be selling it? I did decide to sell like 50 a while back and it didn't last my play session in the vendor. I just assumed I got that single player that needed it for something. I do the queen every time it comes up and usually half the server is there, didn't think the ultracite I get from it was really that rare to find.
---
Adding NW challenges are not going to make people like this mode.
---
Fair, if it were OSRS style polled content then I'd vote yes even if personally I don't give a fuck one way or the other.
---
Both me and my aily have the costume, plus since I have been doing the dailies since the beginning, I have many thousand mr fuzzy tokens.
---
once you have the costume, you need the paddle ball for griefers
---
This one does bug me. I don't want to buy 3 .38 rounds one at a time every single day. It's still better than leveling up in a clown suit though, I hated that the most.
---
You're not wrong!
---
It's no wonder it leaves a sour taste in your mouth.  That tends to happen when one gets used.
---
I'm done with it.    I'm getting to the point that I only help low-level players who don't ask for help.  I'll make them the highest level heated-coil bat they can use, and leave it at that.   They don't have to worry about ammo, and the bat will carry them far.   (I did it with my second character.)
---
"Do you have ammo that I can have?"   "I use it all."   That's true.   It either gets used,  converted, sold or given to friends.
---
"Do you have stimpacks and purified water?"   "Sold them this morning."   Also true.  Weight management is tight.  And no, I'm not giving out the stuff I kept for my personal use.
---
"Do you have screws?"   "Go to this place to get them."
---
Questions X Y and Z:   "I'M ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE AND TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME.  MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME."
---
It's not limited to low-level players either.   There were two guys who, every time they saw me, hit me up for materials.   I don't see them much now.    After  level 60, you should be able to have adequate materials.   I'm probably coming across as a horrible person, but I'm just tired of it.   They will bleed you dry and/or have you do all the grinding while they flit from one fun thing to another.   Just no.  Grinding is a big part of the game.   Get with the program.
---
I appreciate the input it def helps with my decision making. I‚Äôm grinding now to get my rep to max for both factions, so can‚Äôt buy the weapons yet but I do have my eye on both that you mentioned, once I get that max rep...
---
I mean yeh you don't need them that's for sure, very much a personal preference mutation.
---
Me. I do fuck all. I'm lvl255 ISH. And just wander. I've top weps and armour. I have no intention of finishing the game. Just wander and get better . X
---
Oh, man.
---
The problem is the way the game stores your items.  I have heard reports of various types but the most important I‚Äôve heard is a linked list in which a stimpack may be connected next to your *goodgun* which is connected to super stim . 
---
So you intended to sell all stims then super stims but accidentally sell the goodgun because it was the next. 
---
The real kicker is that next could be junk, holo, a gun, or something on the same list. It‚Äôs very unintuitive
---
I'll give you the torso and arms for free.
---
GT: rammadeus. camp near top of the world. 
---
GT?
---
Different game genre's. 
---
e.g. I never liked western stuff, so red dead never interested me.
---
Same flies for cyberpunk, not everyone will like a game like that, plus it's more of a single player experience. I'm keen to play that one though.
---
Market value for the junk version of Ultracite is around 3 caps per
---
But, you can price and sell at whatever price you damn well please
---
Imagine if after 1.5 years no progress was made to fix this.....
---
Pattern? Like a skin for the Marine armor? Didn't know you can find these in game I thought they were atom shop things. I see people with brightly colored camo on their armor and always assumed it was from the atom shop.
---
Hi hello so those three are rare? I think I tossed the emergency protocols one. Crap. Oh well.
---
I knew this would happen!
---
Any  way to permanent ban him?   You may have to tell him no in an ever-increasingly firm manner.
---
Are you stuck on the original quest that has you pretending to be a Camden park employee, or is it the actual daily that is non-responsive? If it's just the daily, there were *many* times that Zoe or one of the other bots would bug out like that for me, often when I was in a party with a player who had not completed the initial quest. That's not to say that was the only time it occured- because there were times I went to complete them solo and even though the quest was on the map and in my log, the bot wouldn't register I had spoken with them so that I could actually do the task (ie: lob the dross, drop off coal, or eat the hotdogs). Eventually, whether it was the next day or days, the quest would unglitch and I'd be able to complete it again (usually when all 3 were up).
---
Also ( and unrelated), is your username good potato- am I reading that right?
---
It was alive? I came across the owlet in the deep but it was already dead. Cool.
---
You get the glow in the dark skeleton suit at overseer ranked 30. I got it this weekend
---
Most likely a glitch, i didn't even make my set in garrahan, so it's most likely a glitch
---
Yeah I wish. When I unlocked the first ghillie suit I was all excited cuz I thought it was a cool new cosmetic armor, only to be disappointed it was only for wood armor that I'd never use.
---
I'm trying to get the combat armor ghillie for my sniper/archer but it's still like 20+ tiles away.
---
Really? I Wasent expecting that sure you don't want anything? I will message you my Gt is An Raging Hobo
---
I just play with polite newbies. At the first sign of rush, exigency or bossiness I block their sorry asses for good.
---
Anyway, 8 out of 10 are really nice and grateful players and I really enjoy playing with them
---
Red dead and cyberpunk don‚Äôt look interesting to me personally
---
You can only craft Power Armor at a Power Armor station IF you placed a Power Armor frame into the Power Armor station first
---
I was had a guy get upset because I only gave him 100 .50, something that I use.   That was the beginning of my change of heart.
---
Its an armor set
---
i used to find loads of them. i have 6 arms and 1 torso plan. 
---
No need to pay anything. just pay it forward when you can.
---
Chicken coop and the galting gun skin are all i want : 0
---
Anywhere between 1 week to 2 months.
---
No, not at all. The game automatically tries to rank up cards to max FIRST.
---
Those scorched corpses have stims sometimes too. The hangar by the cat house has a ton of them, as well as the golf course I can't remember the name of
---
Make sure you have the power armor frame with you. You can‚Äôt build any pieces of armor unless you have the actual frame to put the armor on. Maybe when you originally built one of the legs, the frame was there. But when you went to Morgantown there wasn‚Äôt a frame there. 
---
(If you did have it, and it still didn‚Äôt work then just ignore me)
---
I actually just put the ghillie style on my eyebot helmet, but was disappointed it wasn't the eyebot helmet anymore haha. It does look good though! Just was hoping it was still an Eyebot one lol.
---
There's a trick to do so. Place two door frames down on the same foundation border. Replace with regular walls.
---
Repeat for entire house. Bam, wallpaper on both sides. The only drawback is that it doubles your budget use for walls.
---
I can just block him on xbox but I enjoy playing with the little guy but he's just too needy, I've been telling him I'm out of stuff as a more polite way of saying no but I might have to end up blocking him soon :/
---
I don't know of any way to pull that off without a mod. The game will always try to max out cards first before letting you rank up a new one.
---
Oh right on! I actually have a bunch of ultracite plans..... feels like I may go strangler. But other than the acid effect, is it better defensive compared to t65?
---
Actually I would. I build bunkers and tall towers. It‚Äôs 4.5 stories above AND below to initial C.A.M.P. placement. So if you place it in a tree or side of a cliff, you can take advantage of the full height. But if you place it too high, you can‚Äôt build on the ground and have to reset the module. Or like you said, maybe it‚Äôs too low and you want it higher to gain more height. Each is doable now but tedious. Would be nice to have that green line on the ground showing it barely touching or too high...
---
Some of the challenges like kill robots. Had the casual shielded lining drop other night to complete all of those, the raider shielded dropped awhile back with repeat farming of signal strength. Missing some T-60 pieces too, have a extra chest plan, still collect the maps.
---
Happy cake day
---
Dude thats actually a pretty damn good idea. Itll make it so it wouldnt be crazy op (full set of 3* pa would be op af) but atleast we get some kinda of pa specific legendary perks....itll probably never happen though : /
---
You have to build her guitar out of the ally tab.
---
I was wondering about the other prizes- what does the paddle ball do? Also, I wonder if the large Mr. Fuzzy just a larger scrappable version of the normal ones? I have yet to look up the other rewards available.
---
GOOD IDEA
---
Can't contribute because I'm on PC, but start checking the back part of Camden park for the ones you still need.  Find a ton of marine plans back there.  Basically inside the guts of the roller coaster.
---
Piss off, store your junk.
---
Or just grow a pair and stop whining.
---
It‚Äôs still not open world now is it? Battle Royales, especially poorly designed and executed BRs aren‚Äôt open world.
---
I'm not even doing it for SCORE points, tyvm.
---
Hand to Todd it was. I seriously felt a little sick after. I have little hope I'll come across one again. üò•
---
Thats pretty foolish. I sell amazing gear on my mule alt often to fill his caps up.
---
Hey, I shopped there earlier today! I even snapped a couple pics of it because I was super impressed! Looks awesome, good job on the design, feels like a real wasteland CAMP.
---
The one I have, besides being grey is pretty clean
---
Play on a PS4 Pro, Install an SSD or wait for the PS5
---
Just make a ticket and bethesda will fix this for your account. +80 atoms.
---
Had the same issue
---
That‚Äôs exactly what it is! Thank you!  I built it and she showed up instantly.  I‚Äôll leave this post up for a day or so in case any other noobs need to know.  I watched so many YouTube videos on companionships, but none specified this one very important fact.

You‚Äôre gonna go back to camp one night and there‚Äôs going to be a molerat in a boiling pot of water on the stove!!!
---
I just realised that I am not using PA either :o
---
Or just take the serum, itll suppress the neg effects for a full hour and they're reletively cheap to make.
---
Thank you for the info
---
This made me smile.
---
I've had a lot less luck finding spawned plans, bobbleheads, nukas, and other stuff like that in the private server. You're the only instance in private, while in adventure everyone who comes into an area has a chance to get items to spawn. At least, that's how I figure  the difference. For example, I hardly find power armor at PA stations when I'm in private but almost always in adventure.
---
Just stop helping people 9 times out of ten it doesn‚Äôt benefit you in anyway and showering low levels in loot is detrimental to their progression you are doing more harm than good because then they expect every high level to adhere to their demands of free shit
---
We both are!
---
Sweet thanks for the heads up I had no idea just thought it was broken forever.
---
Buying the farmable dirt tiles from Foundation is a complete CAMP gamechanger. No more gourd hunting, and you never have to worry about adhesive again.
---
Nice, I'll need to go check it out!
---
You can find a full set in nuclear winter you can‚Äôt keep it though
---
I‚Äôm not doing it to benefit me? I‚Äôm doing it to benefit them. This game is super grindy if I can help jumpstart a low levels game to maybe keep them interested for longer then I want to, and maybe they‚Äôll even do the same thing and pay it forward like I am.
---
Their suggested market prices are pretty good for most legendaries. Keep in mind that these are just suggestions and as with anything prices are subjective. A friend of mine put a rare plan in his vendor at 30k caps until he could research it and someone bought it immediately. Turns out it usually went for about 8k, but the person who bought it probably really wanted it, so to them it was worth 30k. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Just wait til last day or 2 to use em, save up some more atoms
---
People consider this a well known and obvious fact , but it's good to remember that that it's not and people who are new have no idea. Your question was answered, and it's good of you to consider others. 
---
Good on you! now try not to get murdeous intent daily from her constant playing :D
---
Nice one. I'll just be racking up xp next time but it gives you a bit of a challenge.
---
Idk
---
Going plus ultra! Lol
---
Or you could just do it on a new character and it takes one game...I agree with the creatures one though it definitely sucks. 
---
They should probably get rid of the nuclear winter challenges in general though, or make it weekly only. It‚Äôs annoying having to change the way I want to play for fear of missing out.
---
It's a nice jesture, but I agree with you. The amount of low levels that send you friends requests, so you can "power level" them or give them free stuff is extremely annoying. They expect free handouts.
---
I have never noticed that before. In all my hours. 
---
Explains how i ended up with a gunsmith 5 instead of a 2
---
Someone posted this already like last week. üôá
---
Appalachia needs Scorched Astronauts.
---
I just have to ask... why?
---
Haha, I'm honing my skills slowly. The bloodied side is a tempting path to follow
---
I'd like to be a certain ghoul and have enemy weapons constantly jamming!
---
I don‚Äôt play on the test servers so I wouldn‚Äôt know
---
Are you sure? Others are saying that it now removes the buffs. There was a stealth change to it.
---
I put all my extra plans in my vendor for free only thing I really sell is legendaries my bullets are free,  that‚Äôs me helping out other players it‚Äôs enough, if I find a rare plan that I don‚Äôt have I have to pay full price I don‚Äôt complain most everyone knows if they come to my base in whitespring they will get something free but don‚Äôt  ask for anything else you want it ‚Äúgrind for it‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs not what I meant. 
---
Why would you post that you don‚Äôt know?  What purpose did that serve?
---
Pa noise is a bit different today than release. It used to be you'd hear the joints getting squeaky like it was damaged as condition dropped. Was annoying, like 2 pieces of lubed rubber noise
---
I was just trying to be helpful bubbo
---
It is absolutely true that it is worthless to a lot of people. I never use it. Can't stand it. And it undeniably worse than even a halfway decent set of legendary armor unless you run heavy guns.
---
Get it from ws?
---
Do you have a source?
---
I'm not really bothered to do the legendary run. Used to be a hardcore player, but I burnt out prior to the Legendary run due to the bullion and reputation grind (stopped mid-completion of a T-65 set). Majority of the rewards just feel flat or weak, nothing spectacular about them, apart from functional rewards which imo shouldn't be behind a grind like this and just in the base game, like the ammo convert, but hey, that's just me.
---
From what I've played of the legendary run, got to like, rank 14, it's meh to boring. When they said prior that it was to make it more integrated with the game, so it felt you would progress naturally, oh boy did they miss the nail there with the hammer and hit their finger, level up once a day, hard for like a lvl 400, and with all the caps, I've just pretty much dropped this game from a religious 5 days a week to 1 day just to get the Tuesday freebie, and maybe play with some newbie friends and babysit them.  
---
Same feelings towards the DooM Eternal cosmetic grind honestly. Meh.
---
Hey I play like this!
---
People just want all the xp. Someone has to take the hit and collect the ore, every time I think it's safe to go, the npcs start dying. I don't understand how multiple lvl 100+ can't keep the people alive.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what it was haha I just had never use it before.
---
Was thinking to get some Life Saving armour and betting on Revenant with suicide to get a nice boost for damage
---
Agree, very annoying
---
That sounds fun. Might have to try that
---
I think I bought it in Whitesprings gallery but not sure
---
Shit I didn‚Äôt know they actually fixed it that shit bugs me to see that I‚Äôve literally killed everything and that is the only one that doesn‚Äôt pop up even tho I have killed her numerous times. I will be putting in a ticket. Thank you
---
I have radaway saved as a fav, most of the time I die before I can even pop one
---
This is a lie unless you were tagged in pvp
---
I have a full life saving powered sentinel set on one of my rifle builds, it's nice and it stacks with mysterious savior
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve never even unlocked it till today, and I‚Äôm almost lvl 300 lol I‚Äôm gonna use it now.
---
Because some intern or office temp who only plays candy crush decided so.
---
Its called:
---
*Bad Game Design*
---
No... every time you level up you can choose whatever card you want. 
---
I am super confused by this post. Just select the card the next time you level up...
---
Yes I now have my cursor in the middle and sell so it doesn‚Äôt skip backwards
---
Some of us, such as myself, have invested hundreds of hours getting the appropriate gear and weaponry to do PvP in the first place. If they change Assassins so it no longer reduces damage from players, many people will go ballistic. It‚Äôs bad enough they made it more difficult to 4v4, and if I tried to take a workshop from you and you have three friends who could kick my ass, I can claim it and as long as I don‚Äôt hit your friends, and just stick with my B2525 fixer, I can choose not to fight them and just troll you.
---
Absolutely! It‚Äôs still a thing!! I‚Äôll send you a message
---
I once saw a fight between a scorchbeast, flatwoods monster, and a sheepsquach. I felt like I was eating popcorn as I watched from the sidelines
---
How is non-information helpful?  
---
Hell, even telling OP to use the search function would be more helpful that ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô. 
---
Was there some prearranged need where the OP asked that you let them know if you were ignorant of any and all questions you asked?  Do you often answer that way to random questions you encounter where you don‚Äôt know the answer at all?
---
I‚Äôm just trying to understand what motivated you to add nothing of value.
---
You become wanted for picking locks but not claiming the workshop.
---
This.  I never have to do his quest.  Just turn up each day and he says ‚ÄúI see you found our missing item...‚Äù
---
but I *love* looting for 15 minutes only to be noob tubed by hippity hop henry
---
I love dropping water, stims and other stuff for low levels, but when they keep messaging me after for guns, ect, it gets annoying, the point of the game is to level up and  get guns, armor and that kind of stuff, as a level 160 I love to help low levels, but it gets annoying sometimes
---
You are reading into it too much you need to relax
---
Because anything to make your camp decent looking is not permitted to be quick and easy. Only painstaking experimentation and creative workarounds are permitted.
---
They‚Äôre the spawn points. I‚Äôm not sure what your gripe is tbh
---
Glad I could help =)
---
Sounds pretty boring to me.
---
You‚Äôd be better off playing FortNite.
---
It's the only one in the game (and usually dies to the cave crickets) and the only way to get the owlet nuggets recipe from its meat, so nice luck right there.
---
I am checking right now
---
The seasonal items would be kind of weird to implement outside the respective holidays though. It kind of shows off how long a player has been in the game as well.
---
Yes the tune is good for the first minute or two.  They certainly should have had a voice actor do some singing and maybe play a few ‚Äúcamp songs‚Äù (a la RDR2). Would have been good.  Also, I probably should have noticed the new CAMP tab for Allies, but just went to where the instruments are instead.  Also looked under ‚Äúquests‚Äù as that‚Äôs where the other special items showed up.
---
Surely you should spawn close to where you die? And not into a Nuke zone when you die outside of one?
---
What is there to read into three letters?
---
What prompted you to share with OP that you had no useful information or advice for them?
---
Was this just ‚Äòfor the lulz‚Äô?  Was it to ‚Äòbe so random‚Äô?
---
PS4.  For whatever weird reason, I only really notice it when I have any instigating weapon equipped.
---
Change to some other weapon type, and the  stuttering image instantly goes away.
---
I‚Äôm gonna go get a few screws to craft a helmet and then check if I have the plan
---
I help everyone I see that‚Äôs under 100 and never get friend requests or people asking me for things, I always message them telling them to take what I drop and to pay it forward if they end up getting to where I am. The way to keep this community as nice as it is, is by showing the new members how nice it is.
---
Heavy is the way to go now.
---
You need to chill out I can hear the veins popping out of your forehead in anger bro
---
Thats my only issue
---
Ive leveled up 150 times since wastelanders and 50 w SCORE...Cant even keep track of all the unlocks
---
I need to fully rebuild my camp with all this stuff but i need a bigger budget
---
@icefire speaks the truth.  Use ciggy machine at your nearest station.  Never failed me.
---
Americas best and brightest
---
As someone with OCD who doesn't really enjoy NW, the constant nag to play NW when I have no desire to is really frustrating.
---
Frankly if I wanted to play PUBG, I'd play PUBG.
---
I came across a friendly Scorched Settler in the middle of an empty field the other day that wouldn't shut up about their hard work building this place up.
---
This is a glitch. Not sure what causes it. I've had it happen once after fast traveling.
---
I'm only 15 levels or so into the legendary run.  Haven't been motivated to play much lately and the prospect of spending all day grinding old content for cosmetics (many of which don't even work properly) isn't the sort of thing that's going to change my mind.
---
I played encryptid today and was very disappointed 1 min after it started I was hitting robots then it said Sasquatch was dead never even got to see him had to be a douchebag there not even sharing the kill
---
OMG.  So much of this.
---
Anger?  Not at all. Just confusion. 
---
What was your intention with that reply?
---
In other words... *why?*
---
Same problem here. Spent a couple hrs moving camp &amp; now its bugged &amp; doesnt show up on the map. Im about done with this pos game
---
It's massively inconvenient and stupid and shouldn't exist. 
---
But ways to combat it include always carrying  a PA chassis ( I carry excavator for iron ore when I want) and/or chinese stealth armor (which you should do anyway, especially as bloodied). 
---
I'm also Bloodied and you get a lot of invincibility frames when you first spawn, more than enough to put on PA or the Stealth Armor in time. 
---
No excuse, it's still fucking stupid, but still. I said this in another thread, there are many many minor inconveniences in this game that wouldn't matter individually, but you put them together, every day, endlessly and they're not minor anymore. They're a fucking nuisance.
---
If you shot someone to get his attention you had it coming mate
---
I‚Äôm gonna stop feeding your obsession
---
I have my stealth suit and radaway both mapped to my quick wheel for this reason.
---
Well they‚Äôre the two closest spawn points to where u are. Depending on which is closest it‚Äôs caverns or prime
---
[*Colossal Carnage Intensifies*](https://youtu.be/xO_XyOsHK6A)
---
I actually quite like it. Im no fan of BR games. But I quite like the uniqueness of it compared to others.
---
I very much have a casual mindset playing it though.
---
I believe people can do multiple things at the same time period.
---
In other words, there was no purpose. It was just spam. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Cheers mate will, put the stealth armour as a fav and quickly equip next time
---
Get your gravelly voice ready!
---
The beacon worked
---
&gt; Your argument cancels itself out.
---
Not if you always carry power armor anyway? If you do and it has a jetpack it's 100% redundant to put a jetpack on SS armor.
---
I've never worn power armor
---
I won't touch battle royal games with a 10ft pole, but I'd actually try a typical team death match or capture the flags pvp mode in FO76.
---
I have a 3* Unyielding Marine leg in my vendor I‚Äôll let go for 500 caps if you want it.
---
AFIK, the critters at the HQ change depending on who‚Äôs been around. 
---
Be aware you will have to go back to the HQ building to ‚Äúregister‚Äù the helmet at a specific terminal.
---
Server hopping may get you lower level critters.
---
You can algo inside WS and use the PA stations there.  No worries about stuff attacking you while you are crafting.  And theres usually a frame at across the street at Blackwater if you need (another) one.
---
So your saying that without being tagged in pvp your Orbital Beacon destroyed the camp. So your Beacon destroyed someone not tagged in pvp with you and this sub Reddit isn't exploding with posts about how peoples camps are being destroyed by strike beacons when not tagged for pvp. 
---
Yeah bs...
---
Cheers will map the stealth armour for a quick escape
---
Not your fault. People aren't stupid, but it's not made obvious what you need to do, there should be endless patience for newer people, especially in regard to answering questions the rest of us take for granted. 
---
This community is better than most in that regard, but it's still nice to see people considering others even as newbies themselves :D
---
&gt;coming back played on release for a few weeks. started a new character doing my thing
---
but ok. i am waiting for an epic story how someone killed his first radroach :)
---
Most of the chems, actually.
---
Watching load and lobby screens for over half the play time..  sorry had to say it üò¢
---
I have a bunch of different plans that I've picked up in my travels, I sell them for 5 caps each. My gamertag is YouSankMe but I'm not on at the moment
---
Un luck pulled a bloodied plus 1 strength 50% limb damage groknaks axe and an op rifle and tesla rifle I'm selling the axe btw
---
Yes only play in the radiation areas when you go out in the clean area you take damage and if you‚Äôre a ghoul you might have to fight normal people that are in your area lol we could build defenses against ghouls oops wait that‚Äôs a whole new game let‚Äôs call it survival mode
---
GARY!
---
Try the other market-based subs. This one doesn‚Äôt allow bartering.
---
It's understandable because the description is rather misleading and it's not very intuitive in how it actually works.
---
Yeah it's a selling point for alot of Youtubers to be hating. A huge crowd gather to hate together wether it be gaming, politics etc. And the Youtubers protect the integrity of their statements by never going back on their word
---
Honestly, if people are still playing the game that has constant issues with no hope to fix them, do to engine limitations. Not to mention the increased grinding the game is being subjected to. I don't think you have to worry much. People still pay for 1st no problem. 
---
I stopped playing religiously 2 months ago and started putting time into more games that deserve it. Been playing since beta woth 1500+ hours on, but now its not worth it to play more time than achieving a full days worth of score.
---
To answer the question, Fractured steel is their answer, but even then I don't think their too worried about it.
---
I didn't know that at all, holy shit. Thanks.
---
Idk what unyielding is off the top of my head I only been playing 2 weeks lol
---
Is that so? I thought you must be close to your team because the description is badly written up
---
All could have been avoided if it was for all armors
---
It's still a ballache sadly, as being bloodied/unyielding you lose a LOT of buffs and SPECIAL perks from having to swap out, but considering it's weight and the weight gain you get from unyielding itself, you barely notice carrying other armours etc and it can save you from stuff like this. 
---
Definitely on your side though, it's an issue that no matter how small, shouldn't exist.
---
I put mine in my vendors for free I don‚Äôt need em so pass em on
---
Not at all.  If you've ever died in a V9 Scorched Earth, you'd know this.  The closest spawn point to V9 is, surprise surprise, V9.  Not a mile away over at the Glassed Caverns.  Not in the middle of Fissure Site Prime.
---
Yeah Bethesda,  get a mooooove on
---
I've never even entered NW and I refuse to. I'm quite happy on my private server with my friends or all by myself.
---
There are lots of strategies to deal with this - one good one is don‚Äôt stand on the ground near buildings where there is a guy with a grenade launcher on top.
---
for one thing its almost impossible to have a finished build in 50 levels..
---
Fortnite is more toxic than CoD. That is saying something. Why should I be turfed out of Fallout PvP because you PvE people don‚Äôt like it? What if I don‚Äôt like grinding literally the same four missions, seven events and getting 3 tries a day for good gear at 1/8000 odds? And what if I don‚Äôt want all the time and effort I put into trying to equip myself for this being wasted? PvP in Fallout 76 is unique. It‚Äôs totally different to the normal PvP games.
---
Increased damage resistance the lower your health is
---
Save the level ups for when they release legendary perks
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs kind of a game changer for me now lol
---
I just want to beat the damn ship
---
Bulk 25-40 caps
---
You are not Garry....   We will make you Garry
---
Yeah it's just either worded wrongly or doesn't work the way it says. But either way it's a fact. you can play on a private world and create your own team solo, and still get the special buffs from herd mentality for zero negatives.
---
I‚Äôm getting downvoted for pointing out they‚Äôre the nearest spawn points because op is complaining that‚Äôs where he spawns. At the spawn points???  lol
---
+3 to all stats (except END) when low health. From what I understand it‚Äôs a solid option for Bloodied builds alongside Bolstering.
---
That‚Äôd be more upsetting if anything in the atom store was worth having
---
admittedly, i don't really do builds... i just went all in on shotgun related perks and picked whatever else i wanted, i don't have any trouble in combat so, what's the benefit to builds?
---
Holy Shiitake ur my new hero it‚Äôs hard to level at 75
---
The mode is shit but the pa paints and a few other rewards are pretty good I wish there was some other way to get them
---
Do yourself a favor and dont reinstall the game. Ever. If something optional like the battle pass system made you uninstall and rage quit then you're going to be just as disappointed with the Brotherhood content. One Appalachia will probably trigger a similar response as well.
---
I was using an alt earlier who just hit 14. I got two crappy legendaries and some 3 digit in upwards of 3 hundred comes in and takes the rest.  
---
Considering the kind of world and all, IMO these low level ones are a waste of time vs reward. 1 Starts get 3 script at best and the XP from such low enemies isn't worth it.
---
What was the rare junk item?
---
They don't OP is lying to save face. People would be talking non stop on this sub about getting griefed if it did.
---
You can rank up about 4/5 times through the whole thing and still come out at a net positive b/c the Atom rewards are the same as the cost to rank up
---
Having more perk cards allows you to be more flexible. I use a perk load out for single player, team play, explosive weapon vs not, items repair, chemistry and gathering, omg I need to fast travel and am overweight, etc.
---
It's hard to farm?
---
Only for spawning bloat flies
---
Toot toot mother fuckers
---
Strangler has worse defense, but t-65 is like 1-2% less damage.  The AoE acid field and a bit of extra damage for your attacks makes Strangler the better armor in my opinion.
---
Thanks.  
---
I hit 55 today after doing the Daily ones and am 3 spaces behind red alien dude. The rewards are largely lackluster and I'm going to wait towards the end and see how far I can get without doing it.
---
You‚Äôre complaining to the wrong crowd.
---
We ‚Äúliterally‚Äù don‚Äôt care, because we have no control over the direction and code base of this game.
---
Tbh you accept that risk by dropping it, it's a bummer the new guy didnt get it but I dont understand being frustrated st the guy who wants free loot
---
Unless Op is in that weird case where a Perk Card *didn't unlock*, which isn't unheard-of.
---
I've always wondered why they never did this. They have different races in skyrim, how cool would it be if they rolled it over to fallout. Like have human, synth, super mutant or goul and each one has a certain race buff
---
Il up vote you, put you back to normal lol, I think the spawns are a touch inconsistent, I have died at v9 and also spawned there before
---
JUsT.... wHY
---
Ok, I‚Äôm only doing the same shit as everyone else here. Fruitless. Getting nothing. You included.
---
Oh I never have. Even when I‚Äôm farming SB. Always at cavern or prime. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong I just assumed they were the spawn points. Not everywhere on the map is
---
i guess i understand that, but i don't know what perks i'd want, other than the ones i already have that i switch out sometimes like you say!
---
What are you doing with your level ups?  Moving points around?
---
Use one of your level ups to choose that perk.  
---
Also, when leveling up from 1-50, you can pick a SPECIAL to increase but then pick a perk card from a **COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SPECIAL**.
---
Just save it for whenever you need em. I used to think the same thing until I started switching around my play style and trying new things out. It‚Äôs not hurting you anything with them sitting there unused. Just save up and if there comes a time you wanna try something different, then you‚Äôll be able to.
---
I saw that recipe when I got back. I use herbivore though, so I'll probably gift a meal to a random player.
---
Yeah wtf is this guy on
---
This always boggles my mind that so many people just don‚Äôt slow down to read the information on the game screen.
---
Ok I guess
---
I only saw the recently released one being fix I'm not sure about the other ones.
---
Freedom of expression doesn‚Äôt mean freedom from criticism.
---
You gave your opinion, and in my, equally valid opinion, if you don‚Äôt like the direction the game is going, you should play something else or complain directly to Bethesda and see how far that gets you.
---
Don‚Äôt blame the PvE community (which represents the vast majority of the fan base, btw) for your problems with the way BGS tried to implement PvP.
---
Or you mean 1500 atoms containing 4 items you already bought individually and 2 new ones you can‚Äôt purchase separately outside of the bundle of which you get no discount for owning 3/4s of already. 
---
Thanks team
---
alright, that makes sense to me. i'll do that, thanks. i was just wondering if that was how it was supposed to be.
---
Idk why they can‚Äôt let us just change the HUD/Pip Boy color just like in F04
---
I love triggering PvP by contesting workshops. I dont mind loosing few caps if I die. Free junk is free. This game needs more PvP in adventure mode
---
Is there a workbench in the area to break down all the weapons?
---
A guy who I helped through a post on here asked me if I had a two-shot, exploding handmade I could sell him..!
---
Aye, sure mate, just let me rake past all the other two-shot exploding weapons I have to see if I have a couple...üòÑ
---
Beyond having the extra perks, save the levels and perk packs, never know when you will get a new item that has you reconfiguring your build. At lvl 200, I just burnt 15 levels to work with an explosive weapon I traded for.
---
TSE‚Äôs really aren‚Äôt too good anymore
---
Follow him to his camp and explosive bait the shit out of it
---
Oh yeah definitely and no problem. I‚Äôm a causal player too lvl 270 with no build preference so you‚Äôre all good. There‚Äôs so many play styles for this game
---
It‚Äôs one thing looking at what‚Äôs there but blocking me from my own loot and the person it was intended for so you can ‚Äútake all‚Äù is toxic, if you can‚Äôt understand being frustrated with that then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you
---
Yeah that‚Äôs annoying, and many of their assets cause further issues, I like to at least use half walls for the side near stairs but their new southern-looking patio blocks the ability to use that. And why can‚Äôt we use fences on second story floors? Really annoying to have nice patios without proper railings (only thing I can find close is a half wall, and that blocks so much Of the view).
---
If you have a non-animated card and chose to rank up an animated card, it will use the non-animated one as the ‚Äòfuel‚Äô, and you will end up with a higher rank animated card. 
---
You can only have enough cards to add up to one version of each rank. 
---
In other words, since First Aid can be Rank 3, you can have six Rank 1 First Aid cards, or one of each Rank 1, 2 and 3, or any combination in between. 
---
Adrenaline has five ranks, so you can have up to 15 Rank 1 Adrenaline cards.
---
The game will not allow you to select a perk card (and will not randomly reward you with that perk card from a pack) if you have the ‚Äòmax copies‚Äô.
---
NW is stupid in so many ways .. high level ensures your win/kills so just hide in bushes or go prone in photo mode to hide next to things .. then you will have the perk cards you need to cause damage and hippy hop around... this is how everyone does it.. IRL an idiot gets the drop on you, you are dead.  In NW you need no skills except how to run and hide and after 150 hours of not playing the game you too will be able to one shot 90% of the players.  This is why so many hate the mode... At least fortnight you can just buy your success with money.
---
If you read what OP wrote you will notice that he/she is aware of that.
---
There are other options that are way better for fps than resolution change. Like removing grass and shortening shadows distance (those two are huge). Download the Fo76 ini editor from Nexus, this makes it much easier. Its full name is "Fallout 76 Quick Configuration - INI-Editor and Mod Manager"
---
Did you get almost all the way through the title and was like nah, fuck lemme comment?
---
I feel like I've been here.
---
agreed. upvote :)
---
you cant have troubleshooter armour with a stealth suit though
---
There is a easy way to do it mate. Make a alt char, switch off random team so you will be alone, spawn in the middle and hide in bushes. You even donthave to play, just run from bush to bush until you dies.
---
Depends how you play.
---
I can't be bothered with them to be honest. Got a few two-shot weapons but they're anti-armour or furious.
---
I actually can't stand the noise from the expoding weapons...it gets old quick when you play with the cinema amp and surround sound on.
---
Yeah, I did and I was too lazy for removing
---
PS4?
---
100 caps is just ridiculous tho
---
Not sure. I always wear an outfit.
---
That's why I said the tip is for people who don't have access to Troubleshooter's. 
---
It means it's for people who don't have it.
---
Wendigo collassus
---
It was before they actually saw the board and the amount but just knowing you could get it was enough
---
Generally people don‚Äôt go super hardcore into getting their build setup properly and invest way to much attention to quality of life perks like lockpicking, slow metabolizer, hacker, thru hiker etc. So it‚Äôs not until after 50 and people get into the end game and realize they can‚Äôt really pull their own weight during queen fights and start getting a proper build going so they can be strong and not just a weak jack of all trades character. Also perks like super duper and ammo smith are extra perks you can unlock that you just throw on temporarily when crafting or smelting stuff etc so you still need lots of points. After 50 I realized this and it took me until 150ish to get everything I wanted
---
Pro Tip: Make a burner character... Especially if you want quick rewards. Get to level 2 or 3 in regular gameplay mode by completing the first quest(s) and then hop on Nuclear Winter and crouch in a bush. You will earn both a level up SCORE and rank up SCORE. Within 15-20 minutes.
---
Riding Shotgun event has at least one legendary, alot of time you'll find three in there
---
That makes sense then...one time I went to farm pa parts and not one set spawned anywhere on the private server...
---
Ah oks I will pass on it then thank you tho
---
This !
---
Just stairs you could put agains a wall would be nice. Half floor to fill mthe gap.
---
That's true. But in the end its OPs decision and his junk. We cant force him too, or change his opinion
---
What, you never seen a ghoul before? -Gob
---
I feel like this is the guy that insta kills any legendary enemies before anyone has a chance to get a shot off on them lol
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
The ghille armor looks absolutely awful. Pretty much a Christmas tree bikini. The original suit is the only good one.
---
I think it isnt wrong if it's in the game, that's why the survival tent is in the game, if that isnt an option be more responsible with your junk :)
---
Not the point of the challenges.
---
yeah I dont think I've heard of or experienced that glitch once.
---
I think it might be caused by customizing your characters body type? Idk, I just noticed it tends to fuck up if I try tk make a character thicker.
---
This is so beautiful. *wipes tear away*
---
Nope. Editing the body nor changing the character back and forth does nothing. Still has the messed-up texture
---
I found mine, but I can't remember where at this point. It's level 50 and still my most used weapon next to my Fixer.
---
Well, this is the first I've ever heard of it.
---
You can bleed out burning invincible players with one.
---
Keep in mind that this is subject to change since we still got another 7 weeks to go before they are released in September.
---
- As it currently stands you have access to all Legendary Perk Cards from the get go but can only equip 6 of them at the time assuming you have all the slots unlocked already.  
---
- You scrap unused/unwanted Perk Cards to get Perk Coins
---
- You use Perk Coins to upgrade Legendary Perks 
---
- If you want to swap for a different Legendary Perk after you already equip 6 of them it will cost you 1 Perk Coin to swap cards
---
- Legendary Perks don't replace your current Perks they are an additional benefit.
---
Sometimes you can server hop your private world by quitting, opening the atom shop, then going back to private. I haven't tested that yet to see if it makes a difference with spawns. Maybe?
---
Everyday every single day it gets posted. Either no one actually gets on and reads reddit or they are just trying to get it patched. I have not done this exploit but it doesn‚Äôt bother me I don‚Äôt care if they do it. And you wanna know why? I don‚Äôt pvp I don‚Äôt buy ammo from anyone and I can craft a crap ton by using scrapper perk card to get steel and taking my excavator to lucky hole to get 1000 lead.
---
Haha! Nice.
---
That's daft.
---
damn toxic. just for him taking random junk on the ground.
---
Thank you for that.
---
i was getting rewards on an alt at 25 with a 3\* AA handmade
---
so unless your perks are shite then yeah
---
What does this do?
---
This is terrifying.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to add explosive perk
---
I find them as mods all the time down near fissure prime
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it will I think all backpacks do when it comes to heavy combat.
---
I'll try hold off for the new stuff maybe sounds good though
---
I mean, karma DOES give a huge buff. Power armour helps mitigate the debuff, but shooting a (willing?)teammate would help maxout damage for 60 seconds.
---
Thanks! I'll limit my lunchboxing accordingly.
---
Good to know
---
As long as you can deal 1k worth total damage before she dies then yes. I've gotten that with a pipe rifle before.
---
I personally just use the level ups to respec between bloodied PA heavy gunner and bloodied stealth commando every 50/60 levels or so. So i won't get bored (more than i am already). Also, even if i am roughly level 600 i still find myself tweaking the builds i use with new perks every now and again.
---
Destroys their camp lol
---
Sorry whats AA&gt;?
---
Power plant workshops, power up the fusion core generator, "FREE" with neon letters, drop one Nuka cola in front.
---
There's no consequence I fact you get Nuclear Launch Cards for shooting down the supply bots that have a Vertibird escort.
---
Nah, you're good
---
More damage or more defense depending on what you want, you kind of create a build around certain weapons you want to use like bloodied, junkies, etc. I‚Äôm a bloodied heavy so I need a certain build to be able to survive with 20-30% health and not die constantly
---
Anti-Armour
---
If you mean the cargobots that are escorted by Strategic Air Command Vertibots, shooting them down is not only good but encouraged. If it‚Äôs the ones that come when you do a government supply requisition, then there‚Äôs no point as it drops the crate anyways.
---
The weirdest thing happened to me I got autocompleted then I went my first to do a quest for my world challenge came back and had 7 challenges
---
It might be obvious but you must admit the one page help section tutorial page on the game board that says ‚Äúdo challenges for rewards‚Äù plus the second screen that tells you ‚ÄúZorbo will move over time‚Äù really doesn‚Äôt give a lot of hints as to how exactly the season works.
---
I‚Äôm still not sure what zorbo is supposed to mean but I‚Äôve since laid it on he‚Äôs a timer.
---
Thats exactly what I have now muahaha. Can I launch a nuke at level 19?
---
What does vault steel even do?
---
I'm not sure if they're creeping back in, but I've run into a few the last couple of days that are blatantly cheating. Infinite AP and ammo, flying, aimbots, the whole nine. This morning I just said fuck it and gave up 500 SCORE rather than grind with these jerks a minute longer.
---
And yes, I reported them with accompanying images.
---
I really like the idea of this being a NW weekly as there aren‚Äôt too many of those
---
I haven't figured that out maybe trade with low levels?
---
These are backed up by robo vendors
---
If you have all the shotgun related perks, you presumably have a high STR stat.
---
That syncs well with a heavy weapons loadout (all the heavy weapon perks), a melee 1 handed, melee 2 handed, and unarmed.
---
If you wanted to, you could pick up those perk cards and swap around what weapons you use (keeps things fresh)
---
üòÇ has to be one of the funniest things I've seen on this subreddit
---
Interesting. I do far less than 1k damage and always get rewards. I spend the entire fight with a quad cryo doing 3 damage per hit, usually use 200ish cells.
---
you died. just dont die, you have to be a mouth breather to leave your camp with junk
---
It is. I feel like if you are on at least 3 hours with good build and weapons and determination you can farm anything. Its what makes the game fun
---
Then you need to be slapped and hard
---
Did he have a owl mask?
---
It's a way of destroying his camp without getting a bounty for it
---
I made like 3 tickets about challenges already.. with screenshot to prove my point though it's not even necessary because those they know perfectly well about. nothing happened. no response (except the automated one saying something that's not even close to the problem I addressed). no atoms either. not sure if it's bad luck of they just don't care.
---
Nah was a just a random drop flying around, some guy higher lvl than me was taking shots at it so I joined in. Was worried I couldnt request drops after lol. Thank you
---
I've never got that damn responder bot vendor sell me Hunter's long coat *angry vault dweller noises*
---
You need it to craft Strangler Heart power armor along with Solar and Thorn scout armor, they all have special built in set effects if you're wearing a whole set
---
I dont know, i remeber that there were also a guy with power armor and a gatling gauss, aswell as some white guy with froglegs
---
They originally planned on letting you play as a super mutant but it got scrapped at some point, now that would have been good haha.
---
Raider ammo machine Gauss gun and accessories
---
You‚Äôre not missing anything. Save the level ups and card decks, they might be useful when legendary cards come out.
---
No, those outfits will just hide your equipped backpack.
---
Are you on PSN?  Mind if I take a look?
---
You technically can as long as you have done the needed Quests to unlock access to the Missile Silos but you will not get very far as clearing a Missile Silo to gain access to the launch computer isn't easy unless you know what you're doing some players over Lv.50+ have a hard time clearing it. I suggest you stash the Card in the meantime since unlike other cards and keys in the game they do weight 1 lbs each.
---
No fix, they haven't even acknowledged the issue.
---
There mods on the nexus if you play on pc that can alleviate the problem.
---
As long as you don‚Äôt buy anything and res pawn with a different character then it should provide other options to purchase.
---
1 star weapons get 5 scrip, no?
---
A holdover from the vault raid days to limit armor production.
---
Well, now I know what I am using for the next guild fashion show.
---
Its inventory changes. If you can get someone to stay there swap to an alt and check. or if you don't have an alt log out and in (as long as someone stays and you join their game). One of these methods made the inventory change. cannot remember which one now.
---
 me and some chap kept it there for 3 hours once and we took turns swapping and ended up with like dozens of rare oufits.
---
Use the free terminal from the atom shop and it can tell you where the person is that has the camera.
---
Your problem was taking them under your wing
---
I feel like Furious benefits more from Automatic guns. I've got a Furious assault rifle that I use sometimes to take scorchbeasts down, and they're down in no time. Get those commando perks, and mod that furious handmade into a Furious Powerful Auto handmade and see what you think.
---
I know this isn‚Äôt relevant,        
---
Well it kinda is.       
---
I love pvp but can‚Äôt play more than a couple of rounds of NW without getting bored asf.      
---
            
---
Theres barely any form of variety or alteration, the waiting times for a game and insane, and if BGS simply made a TDM like every other game seems to get correct.        
---
-Maybe there would be something worth competing?     Playing/spending etc? 
---
        
---
Sure I could get addicted to NW, if there was ANYTHING remotely ADDICTIVE OR GOOD about it AT ALL.
---
Pretty sure they added it to vendors. Check Whitesprings

Nw was a REALLY BIG turn off for me I started on it‚Äôs day one and no matter how much time and exp I‚Äôm still lvl 5. The turn off here for me is that some of the gifts are WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY up there like hellfire it‚Äôs bs man now I‚Äôm probably gonna get in trouble or downed for this but give us the armor and other bs but not in nw bugthesda your not fortnite your a franchise based on the game called wasteland come on todd it‚Äôs not hard to make it all work fix the game and not the people. Anyway sry to micro rant. If anyone is sick of bugthesda I‚Äôm doing a tiny project to put em down with my own game and unlike ‚Äúit just works‚Äù we actually will we‚Äôve even been running for two years on a beta &lt;not public yet&gt; and I will MAKE SURE it works instead of halfassin if anyone is interested I can explain some things in small detail or maybe subscribe to my friends yt account‚Äî- dethflame‚Äôs dank dungeon we plan a future live stream for q and a soon but for now everyone plz enjoy our mottos Blok Bugthesda and fix the game not the people.
---
I‚Äôve seen a few vendors sell it, but don‚Äôt know which ones
---
I love when people come visit my camp. I have mine at top of the world. Whatever the train station is called there. It's so nice to see people come and explore the camp and buy stuff. It's great when people see all the money I've spent :/
---
Looks great!
---
I LOVE camps that look like they fit in the world and dont look out of place.
---
Whats the damage on your piperifle?
---
Lewisburg Vendor sells it. I bought it there four days ago.
---
it's not about the junk. it's about other players actions. if you are doing hostile actions against me (attacking me or my camp, stealing from me or from my camp) I should be able to attack and kill you without your permission. that's it.
---
Ty
---
*"Did someone else get to him first?"* \- The contents of the vendor are character specific. When i was getting all the different plans months ago, i used to find the bot with my main, and then use my secondary account to log in to the world with all the different characters and checking the inventory of the bot. The inventory was always different for each character.
---
So I 100% agree but also I have to say just don't do it then. The game has given us 10 weeks I believe to complete all 100 levels, we have more than enough time and other days to complete it
---
Ok the step by step version (as it currently stands).
---
You go into your pipboy.
---
You go to perks.
---
At the top of the screen it says "Legendary Perks"
---
Clicking on this takes you to a seperate screen that shows your legendary slots.
---
You click on an empty slot.
---
It shows you all 16 (?) Legendary perks to pick from.
---
You pick the one you like.
---
Picking a perk will LOCK IT IN. These perks arent freely swapable like normal ones (you can unlock it, but it costs perk coins)
---
If you want to you can go and fill the remaining empty slots.
---
If you click on a slot that has a legendary perk, there's an option to rank it up. This then shows what the next rank does, and how many coins it costs to do so.
---
Earning coins:
---
This is done on the NORMAL perk screen. When you look at your spare perk cards, in addition to the usual "examine", "rank up" etc, there's an option for "SCRAP". Choosing this option will destroy the card, and earn you one legendary coin.
---
For obvious reasons you probably only want to scrap duplicates or cards you know you will never use.
---
For the vox quest
---
I recently acquired the stair variant that has wider sides and different handrails and thats a big improvement. Atom store I believe. If Bethesda does introduce anything new its gonna be in a 1200-1500 cap package with some clutter before its available separately. Its been their pattern.
---
enclave has it for like 230 caps
---
if you're on xbone i'll come build you one
---
It's the Stay Puft Supermutant Behemoth...
---
I actually had to block someone yesterday asking for handouts. I got 5 messages during a queen fight. Eff off already.....
---
I like having a radium rifle... if I can squeeze off a few even if I die they‚Äôll remember me
---
You don't sound terrible to me, your feelings sound the same as my own. Some people only care about themselves and are too dim witted to realize they are shitting on you, others just don't give a fuck. I'm tired of dealing with both types of bums.
---
A role is something you play at like BOS or Responders
---
A roll is game mechanics, think rolling the dice in DnD, you roll the dice digitally for a weapon drop from a legendary or from The Purveyor.
---
Toolboxes, Broken prosnap have a chance of spawning inside you just have to repair them
---
Ok what's a legendary roll and archive roll
---
kind of like rolling a dice trying to get lucky i guess 
---
so you rolled 20 pieces of secret service and they were all shite
---
or you got a god roll fixer from mumbles. meaning the fixer had the best stats possible (or close)
---
Thanks for the actual answer have an upvote
---
I‚Äôm missing two damn Diseases whoopies and heat flashes
---
It actually has made me enjoy a mode I had no interest in before. Still a casual interest, which is fine because once I get the daily done I've usually had my fill. Also I just hide in bushes and cackle like a loon every time people walk right by without noticing me. Not necessarily the way it's meant to be played, but effective nonetheless since I did eke out my first solo win that way. 
---
I know most people won't come to enjoy the mode this way, though. You're right.
---
On the flip side, as someone who constantly remakes their character (replaying the questlines is more fun than grinding endgame imo) Sometimes folk dont want hand outs. I've had high levels get really offended when i didnt want their gifts.
---
Ohh ok so what are the best stats?
---
I don‚Äôt much mind it. I‚Äôm not a fan of playing NW but leveling a rank isn‚Äôt too bad. Especially since survival time counts so high towards that xp. 
---
The worst one imo is to kill another player. Sometimes I luck out and manage that. I‚Äôm not a pvper so it doesn‚Äôt happen more times than not. 
---
I find today‚Äôs the second most annoying (after killing a player). Use a stimpak three times!? First you need to find a stimpak. Then you need to take some damage, but no so much you did, so you can use it. Now do that two more times. Ugh. 
---
Killing an AI isn‚Äôt too bad. Sometimes I don‚Äôt happen upon one. Sometimes I see 3-4. Even if I‚Äôve not manage to pickup a weapon I can just run up and punch them. They don‚Äôt attack you until there‚Äôs like ten people left I‚Äôve noticed. 
---
I love the camp deployment one. Drop. Move. Drop. Move. Drop. Move. Now try to stay alive because I might as well. 
---
I may have missed a type, but for me, from worst to easiest it goes:
---
1. Kill a player
---
2. Use X stimpaks
---
3. Kill a creature
---
4. Rank up
---
5. Pick a lock
---
6. Deploy a camp
---
probably covid
---
Without context, I'd assume trying the 100 scrip, 3 star legendary shot at the purveyor. I always get shit 'rolls' from her, saved up 1000 scrip, spent it all, got feck all decent. I never get good rolls... üòÇ
---
Just get rid of dailies all together and give us more weekly challenges.
---
That‚Äôs really nice of you.  A generous person was dropping stuff after radiation rumble last night, and there was a greedy person taking items meant for other people.  Unfortunately there are quite a few players like that on here.  BUT people like you are what makes the game great and keeps me coming back so bravo!
---
Poor Metallica
---
Thank you so much for this! Was driving me crazy for so long.
---
Got it but ty for the offer. 192 caps at welch.
---
So is a good roll 3* and does the prefix like bloodied determine if it's good or not
---
Not just ghouls but pretty much every creature
---
Thanks folks, next time this happens, I‚Äôll head to a gold press machine.
---
It would crack me up if one of the mutations caused ghoulification to happen after maintaining a deadly dose of radiation for long enough. All of a sudden bloodied players losing the effect on their gear due to not paying close enough attention to how long they‚Äôve been radded up would be a fun little twist.
---
Archive roll in what context? I‚Äôm not familiar with that. 
---
Legendary roll would be referencing the legendary aspects, ie stars, for armor and weapons.
---
Dirt tiles + turbo fert. Keep throwing turbo fert grenades at them and keep re-harvesting
---
While that would be nice, it is clear this was made to either make atom sales, or get players coming back for more daily
---
Invest in glow sights (perception) , 60% more damage to glowing enemies is usually just 60% more damage in the right areas
---
Thank you! That‚Äôs exactly why I do it, if these low levels just see all the asshole players all the time then why would they wanna come back? It‚Äôs on the game pass on Xbox now so we‚Äôre getting a big influx of new players, I wanna keep them around
---
Setting your status to offline, you still show up in the fallout friend list. I see what your saying tho, gives you a 2 min head start before they know you're on.
---
Ok I thought ther was something called an archive roll or close
---
Not really, no.
---
A year ago I got a disease from shooting a diseased enemy from like 75 feet away though.
---
Thank you. Very well detailed and explained. 
---
üç™
---
List things for whatever you want, but don‚Äôt expect anybody to buy Ultracite at 100 caps. At low levels it‚Äôs hard to get, but you‚Äôll be swimming in it once you start hunting Scorchbeasts.
---
depends on play style and weapon. 
---
People like bloodied and junkies weapons. They do more damage if they have their build right. 
---
On certain weapons people love their 25% faster fire rate and 15% faster reload or 25% less VATS AP cost. On melee people want 40% faster swing speed.
---
Might want to find a disease cure for that
---
Maybe some people do it for the free travel to vendors? If a level 10 is on the team they would rather have a level 300 etc. With a higher probability of something they want. I don't know I have just noticed an increase in sales at my own shop after joining puplic teams.
---
Shhhhh..
---
Yes im aware of that however i was not given a year of 1st as my monthly just came out :c
---
I usually create a new alt character every 7 or so levels, very easy to get overseer rank up in a single match and also a level up in campaign if that's also a daily.
---
Depends on your 'build'. I'm a bloodied build, so if I don't get 3* bloodied with useful perks, I consider it crap. But whatever your build is, will depend what you think is good. Lots of people are after junkies or bloodied, and faster fire rate, explosive etc. If its melee, it could be faster swing speed or weight reduction.
---
The beauty of all the combinations is you can tailor your weapon set to suit your own style of play, but junkies or bloodied are by far the most sought after.
---
That answers so many questions!
---
when you have no scrip space left and an inventory full of legendary crap, it's either sell it to a vendor,drop it or stop playing for 24hrs cos you got no space. they need to allow legendary deconstruction
---
Well, it really depends on the person, just like in real life. I usually never take anyone's loot unless there's nobody around for a while or I see something I need in there. Usually I'd take everything if nobody's close on the map because as far as I know if the player leaves the server the loot bag will disappear after some time anyway. So I better take it instead of it just vanishing. I get how frustrating it can be. When I was a low lvl some 125 person provoked me (repeatedly) to PvP only to instakill me and take my loot. I was a bit frustrated but it's just junk after all. Chasing people because they took something that was on the ground and destroying their camp is kinda toxic. Besides that person couldn't know it was yours? From their point of view you were just another random who found a bag of free loot.
---
Yeah like War Thunder and Warframe right? Oh wait they are both free to play and don't have this same problem...
---
Are you thinking about legacy maybe? Those are old weapons that are not obtainable via game mechanics anymore. The ones that dropped back in the day are still around, and their recently duped brethren are too.
---
No unfortunately not as my month was just charged and I went nowhere other than the pack in the atom store
---
i'm not doing it, i might do enough for the ammo converter, but at this point, kinda done with f76 until new content
---
Yes, i got tired if melee and switched to rifles. I moved something like 15 SPECIAL points and bought a few perks. I enjoy the game a little better since then.
---
the legendary stuff on a mule is passed to it via main toons, the mule doesn't collect it
---
Nocturnal yes, the others are legitimate on armor at the least.
---
You're better server hopping lost home in the cranberry bog, whilst there are more possible vendors spawning the ones that sell outfits sell multiple rare outfits not just two so the chances are higher. You also spawn right next to it so it's easier than other vendor spawns.
---
on my original main i went from rifles to melee which was hard. As i had to farm so many levels as i needed to swap about 25 perk points and the get more cards. And on my new main i went from melee to shotgun which was a lot easier as i just needed to move a few points as i had 15 str already and get about a dozen cards.
---
87 points is easily enough to sort a new build out.
---
It was in the game before survival mode was added.
---
I was bummed when a surprise decontamination arch spray stole my Herbivore and I got Carnivore instead, but it has had a little more utility for me lately. Herbivore is way more economical on carry weight for consumables and better for crafting at your camp, but not needing to cook meat and getting a huge boost off it has knocked down how much food I carry on me.
---
Same thing happened to me. I gave a guy a serum and next thing you know, he‚Äôs hitting me up all the time asking for different things and farming flux with them and it just got too annoying. Ended up blocking him
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a good feeling to finally get visitors! I bet your camp looks incredible if you‚Äôve invested money in it! I‚Äôve only been playing a month and have already made the most of the atom shop üò¨
---
You would say that. Not like it's your video or anything.
---
/s
---
Do whatever is most fun, or whatever gets the results you want. I play a hybrid junkies build, and switch between unarmed, automatic handmade, and a big ass 50 cal. I know my perks and SPECIAL arent optimized, but I have fun and flexibility. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You‚Äôre welcome :)
---
Daily Challenges
---
Welcome to the club my friend.  It‚Äôs a known issue.
---
Ya I've switched and have over 70 level ups stored for my next switch. No way I'm starting that grind over.
---
I'm placing my bet on Season 2 color swapping the ghillie and calling it confetti streamers.
---
I haven't played the game in 4 months does that count? By the time I return everything will be new to me.
---
Lol honestly my camp screams atom shop.one week I buy a bundle because it looks awesome... Next week there's an even cooler bundle. Bethesda sure has a way with their tricks
---
I can still hear that squeaky noise though. I'll check again on Live, but I'm positive that noise is still there.
---
I use the tiny fences under the defences section. Looks pretty neat.
---
I have moved a few points around, not a full on respec, I have a good build for using all types of weapons gameplay. Heavy guns melee carry weight mostly, but I realized early on that three 1* cards in rifleman for instance will get me a 30% bonus where as a one 3* card will only get me a 20% bonus. That method has allowed me to easily switch between melee to heavy with rifleman or commando also active. All hitting 30% harder. I can also have guerrilla or gunslinger active at that rate too, so I can carry a bunch of weapons on me and I‚Äôm not tied to a certain play type.
---
Happened to me too yesterday lol
---
Then and only then
---
Note to self if I see a porta potty out of place hit it with a rocket launcher
---
That seems backwards.
---
Started with shotguns on this toon and then transitioned to Stealth/Rifleman.
---
I only keep a melee weapon on me so that I can kill off any random critters that show up in my bushes. Heh.
---
Makes dope camps though, always happy to swing by a cool lookin camp
---
Adrenaline is a worthless perk right now. So at least switch that off. Gun-fu is a decent trade off there.
---
Yes it's made to make players log in every day and it's the most annoying feature of the season system.
---
Always, love visiting people's camps to see what cool and unique ideas they have in their camp
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a norm now, nice huh? ü§ó
---
What‚Äôs a ‚Äútiny fence‚Äù? The normal fences can only be attached to foundations and not to second story floors
---
I agree. I‚Äôm not sure what the push is to get people into NW but I really hate it. I don‚Äôt mind as much if I can be a bush creep but I don‚Äôt even try challenges that involve killing other players. The load time to actually get to each match alone is a huge waste of the limited time I have to play every day.
---
You don't need to carry the junk either. It will be taken off your stash.
---
Doesn't snap in corners though..do they?
---
Yes but it helps score and it‚Äôs easy 5min quest
---
Want to scare your friends? lay down in a tent and then have the tent owner move the tent, you'll be stuck in the sleep pose and act like the ghouls sliding along the ground.
---
ha
---
also. holy quests batman!
---
When it was announced it was a huge middle from finger to the fan live from Todd.
---
Some bugs are priceless xD I once was in someone's camp, they sold some nice stuff really cheap so the camp was crowded.. That camp was high in the mountains, right above the abyss. The owner just politely sat in their chair waiting for people to leave (god bless such people!) so they could quit.. They quit but their character glitched.. I still have that picture of a naked woman sitting on invisible chair high in the air xD
---
A full set of troubleshooter's armor is very nice for running through the silo.
---
Yeah it's a bit bright and plastic looking, reminds me of tinsel.
---
Fireflys, Chickens, and Sheepsquatch FTW
---
Queen does have a lag switch attack that raises everyone's latency. Probably just got hit with that
---
Build the personal terminal at your camp. It tells you exactly where to go
---
Didn't realize that, Thanks!!
---
Added new bugs??? I believe that.
---
Welcome. We have cake and t-shirts.
---
You can put it on the metal helmet I know
---
Knew that was coming. I‚Äôm still new to the game so they don‚Äôt bother me yet. Lol.
---
good advice, learned that the hard way with something that wasn't a big deal but it was still annoying.  If I'm close on my main for the level, I'll do that but if not I run it on a lowbie to get it done fast.
---
Pepperoni Rolls give +60 carry weight.
---
That would be neat as well. Luckily you can glitch your way to double sided wallpaper. 
---
Even though, I‚Äôll give you, that‚Äôs not optimal.
---
This is why I sell/scrip carefully.  I‚Äôd rather take one extra minute in a menu than destroy a priceless piece of gear because of impatience.
---
It's probably way smarter that way. I've been putting Atoms back into it that I get out but I've stopped doing that as well because you're going to get a better pay off in the later levels then you would spending Atoms early since that significantly cuts down on the time to grind out 3,000 + score on those later levels
---
Nah, sometimes I have it, sometimes I don't, in the same play session.  Haven't figured out what it is that triggers it.
---
I can only agree. 
---
Immersive/lore friendly camp items are much needed. 
---
Luckily a bunch of cool things are on their way! Such as junk walls
---
Right on! I didn‚Äôt really want to start over either
---
That doesn't work anymore (the logging out and logging back in with someone holding the vendor) you can swap to an alt though and check it.
---
When I got my Sheepsquatch Plushie I stopped grinding for it. I actually haven't played the game for a week or 2 as I've been playing Ghost of Tsushima lol I often take breaks from the game so I'm not that bothered. 
---
The only other things I'd want would be the firefly lamp and the fireplace (which definitely ain't gonna happen).
---
I do. Like every 3d ghoul is a diseased one. Today I went to whitespring golf club for some legendaries that were always there but all I got was a bunch of diseased ghouls.
---
Diseases are temporary. Addictions can only be removed with addictol.
---
Commonly happens with "It's a Trap" too.
---
Very common, and one of the popular answers to "why would you play over LVL 50". You have all the perk cards, all the plans, and plenty of level up points to move things around. You can always create a new character as well, I've ended up doing both.
---
Thanks for the tip. I don't really use VATS but I'll give it a try
---
Try going there during scorched earth and also do the bos questline
---
They'd have to fix plaguewalker diseases to be permanent, as of right now it's still temporary.
---
I've never seen one til 2 days ago, he was running around in the sky killing people instantly.
---
That profile name though. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs up! Love it üòÇ
---
No there plague walker mutation explicitly says you can retain them but I doesn't work at the moment.
---
I Would even be fine with that. I just cant handle The stairs any longer lol
---
Heavy weapons and vats is not great in general.
---
If you are running Bloodied you want Serendipity
---
Bottom left is my mom when I answered her back that *one time*
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure if NEVER helping ANYONE out UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES is the best solution here. You can give them a weapon that you‚Äôre not using, maybe give them a few stimpaks and/or crafting materials, and that‚Äôs perfectly fine. If they‚Äôre becoming too dependent for their own good, that‚Äôs when you should probably become a little more rigid and encourage them to be more self-sufficient.
---
It‚Äôs nice of someone to give a lower-level player some items and advice to help them get through the game more quickly, and this doesn‚Äôt always lead to people becoming overly-dependent on you.
---
Yes, but it has never worked. Therefore, diseases are temporary.
---
Yeah but this was hours ago now and I'm not online rn
---
Whitesprings vendors have it.  If you don't find it on a player vendor then go grab it + small water purifier and start your pure liquid cap empire.
---
It kinda is... seems like no one at beth really tried hard to make a Camp. They would‚Äôve seen This right away if they played themselves
---
Cake is a lie
---
It's not missing components that's the issue, blueprinting after a camp move and trying to place it again is always a hit or miss thing. Most of the time you'll have to break the blueprint and manually place everything again or scrap it all and start over.
---
Good tip. If only had known about this method before then
---
Yeah true, I looked up the damage numbers is pretty high at 30 damage per second with stranger in numbers.
---
I Would have to agree. 
---
It was extremely free to use compared to this.
---
Ya know, I just got the fixer plan for free, so I renounce my statement.  But I agree with you.  Not at all is a bit harsh, but just not too much.
---
Just give us back half the fo4 stuff. Concrete, scaffolding, half walls, hell, I'll even buy them in the atom store.
---
Nah we dont need it. I love having to waste all that square footage on stairs. Sarcasm. Just give me damn stairs that are flush to a wall and ffs switch back stairs. One of the key reasons I didnt buy the Contemporary bundle was no switch back stairs and the metal ones looked naff.  Its not hard to do a full set.
---
personally im not interested enough in cuberpunk to get it at launch, much less divert time i would spend in 76 to it.
---
and i never touched red dead.
---
It works on my combat helmet and also the forest scout mask
---
Maybe longer gun range and better vats at range? I feel like an assassin would rather snipe people than stab them from their backs.
---
Good news for you. They have been spotted in data mining!
---
Gotta love that haha
---
Garrrrrrryyyyy
---
It shouldnt be hard to fix, I just wanted more variaty outside of the bloodied and junkies.
---
Aye. it was about 2-3 months ago since i last did it and well, 2 or 3 months in 2020 is like 2 or 3 years normal time. 
---
I think it worked if you swapped to an alt and then back to the first character.
---
Same. Easy money right there
---
Red velvet cheesecake topped with white chocolate shavings is not a lie.
---
Ditto. Now's the time I really need to have an alt
---
I'm on my 3rd revision on my main toon. started as rifle, switched to Mele, now running a bloodied rifle. I've also built 7 other toons.
---
If you are aiming for strangler though I would highly recommend buying vault steel with your scrip as soon as you can as it uses a fair amount. Definitely worth it though as it looks pretty dope with the red rocket skin and adds a bit of damage, though be warned will aggro everything towards you a lot. Also a bit harder to get mods for as only the queen drops them.
---
Also if you hold him in the trade menu for two long he dies.  Good luck with the next bot!
---
Gotten stupid Census Violence to drop the shielded plan.
---
My guess would be double that price at least. But hell I would still pay. There‚Äôs just not enough options.
---
What's the (Edit: legendary modifier) best modifier for a power armor heavy gunner then? Serendipity wouldn't work, I'm using PA
---
My new toon uses it. Since it is an average girl (8 points all stats except charisma 9 and strength 7) with no weapon specialization (medic responder role-play) I need to weaken DR. That 25% makes a difference when fighting some big guys. 
---
Also, I don't know if it works with the Queen, but I use it there too. That and a Plasma Gatling.
---
God one! :D
---
Yea that was my main concern because having to switch from a shotgun build to a rifle means a lot of perk points being switched around. Good to know that players have done this method though. Definitely will be at ease to switching
---
That's because they do not drop from events or world spawn (mod boxes do). The only way to get the plans is from vendors.
---
I‚Äôve always heard if it sounds to good to be true it probably isn‚Äôt. And that sir, sounds to good to be true.
---
There shouldn't be any rewards gained out of that trash mode as it's still in @#$%ing beta and probably will never be fixed! The game crashes and freezes up more often than adventure mode
---
Actually I run one each of four of the specialties, exterminators, zealots, troubleshooter, and ghoul slayers. Seems to me like it provides a better consistent damage reduction to vanguards (I'm a junkies high hp build).
---
That's definitely not an event you want to listen to with headphones on...like  Freddy Kruger's version of Finding Nemo...BUT the third one!! 
---
Why!? Why!? Why!? Why!?
---
Exactly one of the biggest problems. 
---
This one from fo4 makes the hole as small as possible so you can still walk the stairs. 
---
Why wasn‚Äôt that the standard option? I could have lived a lot longer with only that one.
---
I think I‚Äôm now a permanent host to a giant rad worm colony. I‚Äôve stopped bothering to cure it.
---
Every other ghoul I've seen this week has been diseased!
---
I have actually had Commander Daguerre spawn right outside the Rusty Pick. No explanation, she was just there, her normal, headachy self, even though my camp is in the Mire.
---
I see. As long as that doesn't change, and even with an alt the game binds it to the account. Since it is character specific I take it that it wouldn't be possible for the game to known you switched to an alt
---

Emergency protocols I'm sure it's called is great for bloodied PA builds
---
I started keeping a little of 10 mm and .38 and have it set to 0. (100 each) incase a low lvl comes by.
---
I never tried the vault raids. Like, it didn't sound like fun, according to most people.
---
Wow that is a good idea, I liked blocknload .
---
Add me I‚Äôm on Xbox GT ZappyPappy6311
---
Middle Mountain Cabins or Irrational Fear event for honeybeasts.  Mirelurk eggs at Ohio River Tours.  I think those were my last two as well.
---
It takes one match with a character below level 20. Just hide until the third circle.
---
Turbo fertiliser is amazing for when you are crafting food like cranberry relish by saving on too many crops taking up camp space. Plant 1 or 2 gourds use green thumb and a turbo bomb and you get around 8 which is enough for 4 without super duper proc.
---
Yeah guess I will now rip I thought they kept track like nw cards dam all those wasted 1 star animated perk cards I lost sigh.
---
Yes I missed it. My most wanted camp item right now.
---
After the main story you can done ally stuff, and then get ready to just *Grind*
---
Yeah I might as well refresh my mem and look up the other rare vendors
---
Endless repetitive grind :)
---
7 others?! Wow that‚Äôs amazing. How do you balance playing time with all those characters??
---
Thanx level 260 here just started cleaning up remaining challenges
---
Also great idea!
---
Oh idc about ranking up cards, already got all the ones I need maxed, its more of like I get an animated concentrated perk card while I already have an animated one so it ends up a waste, was wondering if bethesda kept track of those extras.
---
yeah, the corresponding headgear for whichever armor you unlocked. you can put a ghillie robot skin on any of the robot helmets (eyebot, sentry bot, assaultron) but with the skin attached they'll all look like ghillie sentry bot helmets.
---
Yeah it sucks....
---
Imagine if such items were always available. They would earn a lot more money I think. I can‚Äôt see this way of making everything ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù as the right way. 
---
Way too many posts about bringing something back to the shop
---
Me too I have stolen the barn next to Charleston Station üòÅ
---
I wish they would just remove nuclear winter altogether*. Fixed it for ya üëç
---
Yeah. True that. AGI isn‚Äôt really necessary for a PA heavy gunner.
---
I AM NOOB, GIV GOLD PLZ
---
Is it just because you want range? You might want to try gatling gun out has great range and damage.
---
I managed to get the Enclave robots in Berkely to fight a scorchbeast  :-) They made short work of it
---
Why is adrenaline useless?
---
Thanks. That‚Äôs what I thought. :)
---
It might vary from 3-5 but I do know 1 starts tend to get 3. I sold 3 today for 9 script total among others I turned in.
---
I get bored and stop playing them, then go back to my main. one of them I built to use gattlin laser because I always have too many fusion cores. he currently has 800 ultracite fusion cores for ammo. others I build and don't like so delete when I want to try something else.
---
Yeah same. 
---
And let‚Äôs be real. It‚Äôs definitely an all time favorite for players. 
---
They could bring it back anytime and people would buy it instantly
---
It's the first time that I have done the quests there where I have to pretend I am an employee. Right at the moment I talked to Zoe for the hotdog thing I lost connection to the server and the quest has been bugged ever since. If I talk to her she just gives me generic responses.
---
And my username means potato bee lol :D
---
Yeah that's it
---
I'll drop off stuff I dont need or have an abundance of in town or maybe a train station. I'll help people near by out of the blue I'll just swoop down complete the "w/e is going on" and shortly bounce.
---
So much cake.
---
I‚Äôm jealous of you lol
---
Even if I had the free time to play and possibly get max Score I'd rather do it more effectively.  
---
The only money I spent on the store was left over on a gift card for that New Appalacha set that got you Piper's outfit and extra Atoms. Anything I've bought from the story are from atoms earned while playing.  
---
I haven't looked at the full list recently but the world isn't going to end if people don't hit rank 100.
---
Yeah I recently got a 1 star bloodied fixer. It was for free and I'm lvl 44 so I can't wait to use it. It's really my only good option so ima use it
---
Pvp public events are a good idea, but get rid of legacy weapons first.
---
Yes. Since the party system was revamped, I‚Äôve slowly moved my strength over to charisma so I can share and be rewarded for joining them. 
---
Before that I moved from a ‚Äòrandom‚Äô build to an explosive one.
---
most people simply DGAF about anyone else.. lazy has nothing to do with it
---
Now that I can get behind.
---
My problem is I don't have the card to select. I have gone through my cards many times and it's not there
---
So far I like the ammo convertor.   Yes could be better but it will get a refresh.  The icons are great, the camp stuff is amazing.  
---
I'm now on the final run.  But getting another atomic paint is not even exciting.  Not to mention what if you don't like it?  You'll have the see it 5 times, just like the ghillie armor.
---
You make a good point
---
The level up challenge is so easy. Create a new character leave vault and make it to Flatwoods. You‚Äôve leveled up. Make it all the way to the airport and try for a chance at a Fireman‚Äôs hat or outfit. 
---
This season stuff has been easy, but I‚Äôve never had an auto complete yet. I‚Äôm nearly done with one character and have started on a second, my wife‚Äôs, and have hit 25 already. She‚Äôs stoked because she wanted the spaceship anyway, but she really wants that monkey backpack. I have plenty of time to go and we‚Äôll all be making hay come MEAT WEEK anyway.
---
It‚Äôs much easier to swap to a pipe pistol or something for tagging mobs, but I totally agree with the sentiment
---
Increasing my health a tad over 20% means I lose out on 10% XP, 25 AP, DR, Damage and become overencumbered which sucks a lot more than selecting a piece of shit explosive pistol and hitting the ground near group mobs
---
get it for ome month to see if you like it. if you dont use the tent, private world, or scrap box mucj and dont feel the need to get those monthly atoms, cancel it. you'll still keep all the 1st-exclusive cosmetics from the atom shop if you redeemed them.
---
True. Which is why I don't nuke whitesprings on pubs anymore. Tired of greedy johnny one shots mowing down all the ghouls I created for everyone to get xp off of.
---
They're called "perimiter wall railing" and they snap just fine.

The good news now is if you‚Äôre on a team, you should be able to get back onto the same server.

i miss the old fallout76... back during beta and right after beta... up until the first christmas, fallout76 wasnt shit. all the super OP weapons didnt work, they healed instead of doing damage, and nobody had full sets of gross legendary armor sets, so pvp was absolutely wonderful... 
---
but on top of that, 3 star legendaries dropped 3 star legendaries. farming westtek and WSgolfcourse for legendaries brought people together. communities and friendships were formed 4-16 people at a time. it was absolutely magical. people would drop thousands of lbs of legendaries on the ground because it was all drop trash, and some noob would show up and scoop his first legendary armor set and his first decent weapon... and the community would grow.
---
but apparently, that wasnt acceptable behavior. so they nerfed the drops, no more 3 stars off 3 stars. but the community still stood together and farmed WSgolfcourse, because you could still get lots of 3 star legendarys to spawn there... 
---
so they nerfed WSGolfcourse, couldnt reset the clubhouse as easily... but the community found a way around that, and banded together to reset the clubhouse from further away, because it was FUN and we were all having a blast and socializing...
---
and then they nerfed it again. and again. and again. and finally people stopped going. people stopped showing up. and what was once a GREAT spot to meet new people became a rancid shithole where you would only go to farm flux... by yourself... 
---
bethesda has been completely out of touch with their playerbase. instead of making the golfcourse a focus of development and making it better, they made it worse over and over. they could have made an event out of the clubhouse farm, they could have made a storyline out of it, they could have put a windigo colossus there and made it the spot for a boss fight... but no, they completely ruined it. 
---
bethesda can sit on it and spin. incompetent shits.
---
i stayed up an extra hour last night trying to complete it it took forever and I'm only level 18.
---
probably wouldn't be as bad if Bethesda fixed servers.
---
Are you saying there are people who exclusively play Fallout 76 for NW? Not trying to slander, but if somebody actively chose to play Fallout purely for the battle royale, I'd question their decision making skills because there are a plethora of other Battle Royales they could play for a much better experience. You're right, the legendary run isnt designed for anybody. But its should not force people to play the tacked on, half arsed, poorly supported game mode the devs wasted time on trying to cash in on the battle royale hype when the game really needed that attention elsewhere. Most of the items dont/cant (you can probably make those gibbet trees but they really wont impact your gameplay) function in the battle royale, so I should not have to play that game mode to get my maximum daily amount of points towards earning them. The vast majority of us should not have to play NW because 100 people still play it. They are trying to cover everybody....well everybody I know plays adventure more than NW, and I'm fairly certain we would all prefer  to not have to completely change game types to go do something completely arbitrary because bethesda can't come up with a way to make more than a handful of people want to play NW.
---
Besides Ultracite Arrows, all damage mods are to the bow itself and fire the same arrow ammo, it's damage and effect are mod based.
---
I only use it for scrap
---
Travelling leather coat is a super rare drop from bog events. You won't buy it from a vendor. You can get hunters long coat however, which is probably what you meant to say.

I just want to use other weapons. I‚Äôve played around with heavy gunner built too as well since it‚Äôs within the Strength category. I‚Äôve played the same character since April of last year so I have never used rifle weapons. Just want to try something new üòÅ
---
Do you have first cause today when I logged in they were completed went to first for a world challenge came back and I had quest
---
As with everyone I do not have the card to picj
---
I tell new players straight up at the beginning.  " ill help get you started but I do play the game for myself, and one day I might have to murder you.," it helps..
---
Wow, its not quite a god roll, but certainly a Jesus or one of his disciples! I'd be delighted with that personally! Hang onto that, you'll probably want to tweak your build around that until you get a god roll on bloodied fixer or handmade
---
When you level up and have the choice to select a card... you don‚Äôt see it when you scroll over?
---
Heh, funny logic. Talk about bored to death. "excuse me sir are you going to buy something yet?  You have ten seconds or else I will have a robotic aneurysm". Maybe they should replace vendor responder bot with that drunk robot, or the insult bot.  A drunk insult bot: "I have a clean spacesuit,  but first you need to trade me 100 vodkas "
---
Nope I had that last night and I'm using English.
---
I found her in flatwoods
---
Sorry I meant hunters long coat
---
Yeah the guy also gave me a fixer plan. I'm going for sneaking bloody ars so it helps a lot!
---
Don't make assumptions I do not have the card.
---
Well shit. Now I wanna see it. You on XB1?
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I meant
---
What's so special about this? Looks just like a foundation and stairs with a slightly different floor piece on top. Spiral or corner stairs are much more needed than this half-arsed piece. With this it still can't go up against a wall because it'll be like walking into a dead end. Spiral stairs. We all know it makes sense.
---
There is a lot to explore. That takes up a lot of time. And yea events also

I found the wanderer near my camp, east of vault 76 in that cluster of trees between the vault and HWY 59.  I was heading toward the nearby workshop on foot when I heard her humming.

Adjust height spin until it goes green

Cut him loose. If they‚Äôre going to be this selfish and needy then they are just a stress inducing liability. My bet is that when you get rid of them they will abuse you then latch on to the next higher level like a sucker fish. You don‚Äôt need to feel nervous logging in because the choosing beggar goes into full grifter mode the second they see you are online.
---
I use perimeter wall railings. Last I remember, I could use them around the stairs. 
---
I just use molotovs, easy tagging doesn't send enemies flying away. Cheap to make. All my characters have at least 10.
---
Even if you figure 30 points spent moving points. That still leaves loads for perk cards.
---
It‚Äôs annoying, but since most of the time the whole SBQ battle is taking place outside of the nuke zone which is kind of cheesing the quest, I‚Äôm kind of like meh.
---
But if you don‚Äôt kill a raider in style, are you REALLY killing that raider?
---
And can we get some standard skins for armor? Adding some gray/black/blue etc. skins would be nice. Easy for them to make and would be really useful for cosmetic reasons.
---
Yah I‚Äôm actually thinking of changing mine to a shotgun build because my only good weapon is currently a shotgun.  I wanted to be a rifleman but am really unable to get a good legendary foe that so far
---
I keep asking her to play Ragnar the Red but she refuses.

It's like they think they're running the Disney vault.

If your on console you might have a sticky rb or lb button

Armor is 3, weapons are 5

It's not about bloodied builds though, there are many builds that can one shot event mobs anyway.
---
Lol had a scorched grafton beast today first time seeing that

Nothing fun. Fr I just quit because it‚Äôs boring and it was only fun to trade for a little while. Idk I don‚Äôt play anymore but when I did I just duped some ammo so I could go on xp grinds

Or a feature that lets you put your own screenshots into picture frames and hang them up in your camp

Same happened to me today, Bethesda probably thought we would be that fed up of the questline we would click the first option to hurry up the end.
---
Are you getting flux at the end?
---
Clearly this is the work of the Institute
---
In NW the grenade drops when you have been downed and, for some reason, inflicts 0 damage on you but all damage on enemies. Pretty great perk.
---
I‚Äôm well aware, thank you. I‚Äôm tired of traveling there all the time and also tired of farming disease cures. Less time wasted just dealing with it.
---
Yea
---
This has been discussed thousand times on this sub already. People one shotting enemies have nothing to do with bloodied. **Any weapon prefix, and even non-legendary weapons** can do the same if the character is build properly. **It is the player not some specific weapon prefix that is to blame.** Always pointing fingers at bloodied is getting really really old. Stop bitching and moaning about this and get your facts straight.
---
I agree. Sometimes people can take the good intentions of others and abuse it so much that they may stop helping others because of that. People should be thankful for the help and not only follow others around in hopes for free stuff.
---
If you‚Äôre level 160 then you‚Äôve had **130 opportunities** to select that perk card. It unlocks at level 30.
---
I would far prefer they give us one like that but with the stairs offset to either side.
---
heres an idea for a new game mode: non-legendary survival.
---
standard survival server, no legendaries allowed outside of the few storyline legendaries you get. gotta make a new character to play on it, and that character is forever a survival only character. 
---
simple as that. id play that game mode 24/7.
---
Strategy?
---
If it‚Äôs not available to be selected then you already have three rank one copies (or a rank 1 and a rank 2)
---
Do you have any level ups to spend?
---
Makes sense. Could even be all 3 directions. 
---
Can‚Äôt imagine that being a difficult task
---
Trappers in 76 and FO4 are different.

There‚Äôs a clearing near West Virginia lumber co that has a tent and a picnic table and some fishing racks and things. That spot is a random encounter spot. I have reliably ran into all 3 ally‚Äôs there (wandering guitar lady, old jokes grandpa, and the raider punk. 
---
You can place your 1st tent if you have one just outside the camp and server hop till you find them.
---
Sorry lol my base is there so I normally do a run thru there just for xp
---
Will do! I just got off after finishing today's challenges. I'd love for an opinion on mine too. I spend so much time looking for plans, testing out stuff with the flamethrower glitch and the down shift glitch. I think I might be done in November cuz I REALLY want those Thanksgiving display cases. Also on my list that I i should have before then are  the firefly jars, chicken coup, hidden fireplace door, cat topiary and fish lamp
---
No, they don‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs not a waste. When legendary perks became available you can earn the related points by turning in cards. Animated cards give x5 points. 
---
So, ideally, having ‚Äòextra‚Äô animated cards you ‚Äòdon‚Äôt need‚Äô will be a good thing.
---
That is a shame. I wish people wouldn‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôve had some people try that and luckily with atomic paints most of my weapons are hidden. I avoid trading directly with players and usually just drop the items.
---
Also: who the hell wants so many fireworks?

There's one hacker that I hate ending up in games with. He is very subtle, but you can tell he's using some kind of cheat. If I know I'm near him I just kill myself instead of giving him the satisfaction. He loves teebagging then doing the radiation/throwing up emote while people spectate him. I don't mind dying to other people, even cheaters it's just the bad sportsmanship that gets me.
---
This is something I often talk about that 76 does so well. 
---
It's environmental story telling is top notch. Almost every little unmarked location on the map has a little story to tell. 
---
It was how I spent most of the first couple months after release. Just exploring and sussing out the little stories told in the setting.
---
You can, though they look like ass if you're trying to do a clean build. If that's the case, using half walls is better.
---
But you can't have a roof or floor built above before setting the rails or half walls down or for whatever reason the system won't allow you to place them.
---
Hey, bloody build here. I one shot things with full health and no bloody/unyielding effects. 
---
Please stop with the slander!
---
Roleplay

Super Moth!

I did not suggest that people play exclusively for NW, that is a wild misinterpretation of "people enjoy NW". Irrespective of what you or other people think about NW, it is a game mode that Bethesda wants to keep, and the player base is several orders of magnitude larger than 100 people, as you infer. In any case, Bethesda has every right to incentivize people to engage with the game mode, and above all else, provide challenges in it for people that actually like the mode. But of course the main issue I have with all these posts is that nobody is forcing you to do anything. If it is important for you to get the max out of the run, then you know what you have to do. Either play NW, or grind the weekly recurring XP. Of course all these posts come from people that want everything in the run but don't have the time or desire to play the game daily. Get your FOMO under control and do what feels right for you an your situation is all I'm saying.
---
Holy crap are you me? They're exactly the same things I'm grafting towards and the display! Yes my dude I love LOVE checking out camps. Add me and I'll come see yours tomorrow! üòä
---
Theres a mute chat audio option in the settings. You can set it to team or local to I believe.
---
We‚Äôve seen that statement before from others. 
---
And every single time, once they stopped to look carefully enough, they find it‚Äôs there. 
---
It‚Äôs been 100% user error so far in all past reports. 
---
If you want to insist it‚Äôs not there, perhaps you should take screenshots and submit them to Bethesda. Because it would be the first confirmed case of actual missing unlocked perks I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
Download app fo76 it will show all spawn points
---
Hit start to bring up the map. Left bumper or L1 on ps to bring up menus. Go to audio and it will have a chat option switch it to area and you can hear everyone as long as you are close enough to them.
---
Realistically I'm expecting more double score, triple score, or maybe extending the end date to try to make up for it.
---
Yup. Not a ton, one or two of each kind.
---
Do you still have any?
---
I have tried both settings and I‚Äôve never heard anyone. ):
---
People do PVP... but it's still useless. I could choose to do 10% extra damage to *players*... or get damage boosts to *everything* via one of the other, better perks.
---
My sister has this happen to her. It‚Äôs incredibly annoying. You should be spawned outside the blast radius close to where you was upon death. Silly to send you miles away into the red death zone.
---
NW did not trigger this for me. I‚Äôve only ever played one match and that was weeks ago.
---
Nope hit em and git em
---
What if Falloyt 76 is a improved engine from Fallout 4 engine? Not that I would know and that's why they can't add this to the game?
---
I thought they would do that with Wastelanders. Would give me a reason to keep assassins weapons. Lol
---
Unfortunately not, this started happening frequently since the update right before 20. I have a PS4 pro and and I‚Äôll get a blue screen crash at least 2 times per PIay session. I just send the crash report. About all you can do.
---
Edit: corrected PlayStation to play session
---
I will try again. What is it unded
---
Definitely don't wanna go around spreading tetanus!
---
Harper‚Äôs ferry, the burrows, national isolated radio array, West tek, huntersville, Whitespring. Server hop, then repeat.
---
I mean what category
---
How exactly do you replace them?
---
Same thing here.
---
If your headset has a volume control it might be turned down. I experienced this when I first began to use my headset and the switch for me to be able to speak was also off.
---
I'd hoped this game would have player classes like skyrim did.
---
I'd love to be a ghoul, or super mutant. Heck even a robobrain.
---
Each class could have advantages amd disadvantages.
---
First tell me what you *think* it‚Äôs under.  Because that was going to be next question. *Where are you looking?*
---
It‚Äôs a **Luck Perk**. Look there.
---
This might have been it! I remember my mic was muted once I had started a party for the first time in months. I‚Äôll have to check the mic volume again and see if I can‚Äôt run into anyone with a mic in game lol
---
Because they have glitched "buildings" there and they dont want to get reported. :'D
---
This. The plans are actually crafted on the bow. The bow will automatically change the arrow type when you apply a mod, say plasma. Ultracite is the only exception  as you have to actually craft ultracite arrows along with the mod for the bow.
---
Also on Xbox if you go into devices you might be able to pull an update for your headset.
---
Imagine if after the birth of this engine no progress was made to fix this....
---
Best items are T-60 PA plans but they only drop from certain Cranberry Bog and Savage Divide maps. Best to dig in a group with at least 3 other ppl on the team, everyone close to the dig site will get chems, caps, ammo and other items. The mass scrapping of the weapons and armor are great for steel and unlocking mods if your character is a low lvl.
---
No ammo factories I can find
---
Until they crash, because FO76 does that a lot.
---
Some people just like having privacy, somewhere where they can chill and not have other players disturbing them.
---
Minimise every window on your computer. If that doesn't work try alt-tabbing.
---
Rusty dick is my favorite PA mod
---
So it wasn't just me. I noticed that too
---
I think they should just give atoms so you can buy what you want üôÇ
---
Haha it looks like ‚ÄúThe Rusty Rick‚Äù good one üòÇ
---
I was and they got kicked too so I guess the server crashed?
---
Hey, I resemble that remark.
---
Re-downloading won¬¥t solve it. At least it didn¬¥t for me. As i see it frequent crashes are just part of Fallout 76. By now i Just hope it won¬¥t happen when i am about to finish a mission, event or when i build a workshop.
---
Yeah I thought the robot ghillie armor looked sick so I figured I‚Äôd finally make a commitment to a set of armor on one of my characters
---
I also take pride in my camp. My current camp is right beside the purveyor's place. It is a village along the road. It has a Red Rocket garage (great Atomic addition) a small cafe run by a Slocum Joe vendor, my home, a barn with cow and chickens, a small vegetable garden and a Backwoods trailer housing my Decon shower. 
---
I just completed the SCORE thing so I got the fireplace secret door. I figured I needed to put something interesting behind it. I built a BDSM dungeon with a cell holding the settler wanderer in a bathrobe and a warning above it: "dont feed the sex slave."
---
 I had my character standing in the room in his tighty whities wearing the bog mask and golding a cattle prod. Just left him like that while I worked on my Score for my alt. 
---
Two guys opened the hidden door, thumbs up and stripped down to their whities and proceeded to bob up and downn. I guess the closest thing they have to sex in the game. 
---
It was fucking hilarious, and a huge payoff for my work
---
Cheers üòÄ
---
I just wander and do lots of different things. Some days I do events, some days I try to complete tadpole badges, some days I just go to peoples shops and see what they have for sale. I also have gotten really into camp building
---
People are bitches all you need is PA and a door boom you walk threw
---
üòçOooo....is that the pylon near the Monorail Elevator, west of it?! What system are on, and do give tours? From what i can see, you have a home and a masterpiece!! Sooo...B..e..a..utiful.
---
Don't ever spam in this game. If you're on PC, move your mouse a tiny bit after each purchase/scrap/whatever to make sure it's aligned where you want it to be. Be happy it's not as bad as it used to be, you used to be able to scrap legendaries by spamming
---
I remember when I started I was lacking some fusion cores so I when to different player camps to buy some, while I was looking at my inventory a player emoted me to follow him, so I did, the player dropped 6 fusion cores, when I saw that I was very thankful and naturally I spammed the heart emote. At the same time, I thought to myself "man, I need to repay him somehow" however I knew that I couldn't, instead I used that kind gesture as an example to follow, and I help new players much like I was helped. Kindness breeds kindness.
---
Go to Solomon‚Äôs Pond and travel downhill from the spawn point for the location. Specifically moving South, to slightly southwest- there‚Äôs a dirt road you can follow. Once you hit the irradiated pond, you will see the lump in the lake wake up and roar. (Swan 2.0 for sure).
---
It will apparently be fixed with patch 21.
---
You can bet your ass we are gonna get new items in the atomic shop tho.
---
I think they still think other players can steal their stuff from the stash box
---
I did what you did and finally did the vault run today. Sadly those score rewards bullion I claimed aren‚Äôt there. :(
---
It's already fixed in the PTS so it will be fixed with Patch 21
---
The fix will be in the next patch, on august 4th. People have tested and confirmed it's fixed in the latest test server.
---
https://youtu.be/pZc75KwfOe0 do it at a workshop, your camp is ruined forever if you place them there
---
I always just get scrip for any type of assassin's gear because I just find it pointless
---
Next patch is what is being said.
---
Why they removed any buildings from the settlement system between fallout 4 and 76 will baffle scientists for decades.
---
Why are their no diagonal half floors?
---
Why is there not a fast travel mat for our C.A.M.P.?
---
Why leave in a broken power counter?
---
The inner workings of Todd Howard will forever remain a mystery.
---
He's also the guy who initiates your Encryptid before anyone else gets there.
---
What retardeds
---
So the other answers here are not wrong except in the case of lode bearing... a lot of the veins in there are just plain broken some are fine others just have never worked.
---
Min maxing is the reason why people complain about RNG.
---
It wouldn't be same if you did get it on second try
---
I like to Photomode my way in, and drop spoiled meat on their bed. 
---
Or now that those people somehow cheated and got the ammo machines in their camp. I break in and steal all their ammo. Then I go to my friend who will kill me for the small 10-20 cap bounty.
---
Cranberry Relish will tank you with 20% Bonus XP, fyi.  Once you have Gourds planted, finding Cranberries will help.  Ofc after you save up Sugar.
---
With SIN, 25% Bonus XP.
---
Yep only have one real character, my other holds weapons I might use at some point for other builds.  My problem is I run shotgun, melee and rifles haha.  Sometimes my perception gets robbed for Strength and so on.
---
GAAAAAAAAAAAAA√ÄAAAAAAAA√ÅAAAAAAAAARY
---
It be there.... Sigh
---
The last two lines are corny af my dude. It's just a game chill out lmao
---
I get blue screens all the time. I pass the blame on bethesda only because I frequently see on patch notes that they try and fix errors causing crashes
---
People don't usually help others to benefit themselves...
---
I used to be really generous. Not just with items but with my time, which let's be real is more valuable than a handful of stimpaks I was gonna throw away anyway. I'd happily help lower levels through quests, show them stuff, etc. But more and more, people started abusing this and clearly wanted their hand held through literally the entire game, and had the audacity to ask (demand even sometimes) for everything from OP legendaries to scrap. I find the latter more annoying somehow, it's one thing to want a rare weapon that's hard to get but come on, junk is everywhere around you, just fucking do the work and pick it up.
---
It's not like this game is some Silent Hill-level puzzle, you really shouldn't need someone to walk you through every quest. And if you do, Google it like the rest of us did when we got stuck!
---
Gonna follow me around and annoy me with trade requests? Block.
---
Gonna message me every day asking if I have steel/copper/flux/5.56? Block.
---
Gonna spam me with Party chat invites every time I'm on? Block.
---
I don't care about being nice any more. It's not my obligation to adjust my game just to "be nice" to people who can't figure it out. Why should I "be nice" to people who clearly don't care about being nice to me by respecting my time? Fuck outta here, leave me alone and let me drop nukes in peace with my actual friends who I have fun playing with and who don't mooch off me non-stop cuz they have their own shit they earned just like I did.
---
Attack of the Titans!
---
GAAAAAAAAAARY
---
Well yeah but this was for the level displayed on a vendor. So level 2 mules would really show the level of the main account at their vendor
---
As someone that just moved to a bloodied build, "FUck Yeah". Fucking multiple times of spawning, trying to figure out which way to run, and just not making it. Or the rads keep getting you even though you're out of the nuke zone. No time to switch over to my chinese stealth armor. You just die over and over, till you get lucky. It friggin sucks.
---
I'll double check, but I'm pretty sure they're already checked off.
---
I agree with adding a legendary effect but I don‚Äôt think junkies should have negative effects. It‚Äôs the only build that can almost stand up to bloodied and even then it‚Äôs not by a long shot. They should make other builds viable and make them even with bloodied... that usually means nerfing bloodied but I won‚Äôt say I want that to happen cause I don‚Äôt want to get downvoted to hell lol
---
Yeah, it can
---
This is why I rarely help anyone anymore, let alone post a message on Xbox to help. I'm generally a lone player, but wouldn't mind some friends to run around with at times, so I would open up to helping. Then I get bombarded with questions asking for stuff. I'm not sure which was the worst experience so far: the  new player that asked for help on a bunch of stuff and followed me around all the time that ended up having a level 100+ and just wanted someone to help level an alt for him quicker, or the 40ish player who asked for a bunch of serums(I gave one of pretty much each one) and then I go to his camp and see his vendor full of said serums for sale. I'm wary of people to begin with through a combination of anxiety and apathy, but stuff like that just reinforces my reasons for avoidance.
---
Yayyyyu
---
In my experience even if you're online in the Fallout list, if you're appearing offline on PS4 they can't follow you to your server. I thwarted a few hangers-on this way, and have had trouble joining friends who actually invited me to come play with them if they're showing offline on PS4.
---
I took a young level 17 under my wing, gave him plenty of good stuff. One day, I asked if he had any ammo and he told me he would sell it (10mm) to me for one cap each. 
---
It‚Äôs not the caps, it‚Äôs the principle!
---
I even had my survival tent right there! Outside of the nuke zone! Why can't I spawn there?
---
oh so like giving cosmetic outfits and hats a gameplay purpose? I like it but they would need to make clothes a lot more rarer in that case so some nutjob isn't killing people in one shot with their bloodied rolling pin while invisible
---
That never happens and you are just lying lmao
---
Coming from a bloodied unarmed build. 
---
I hated doing uranium fever because by the time I ran to any legendary. It has already been killed by some guy using his explosive gun. 
---
So I said to myself ‚Äúlet me craft a low level machine gun‚Äù so I could at east tag the enemy without killing it. Because I wanted to be nice and not kill them in one hit. Plus I wanted to guarantee I get a hit. 
---
It was fun for a while. And it worked. But eventually every event had these players, shooting it from 20-30 feet away and still instantly killing it. So I got tired of it. Now I have a bloodied pump shotgun. Which lets me VATS an enemy about 15 feet away and I make sure I always get the reward and the loot. 
---
In the wasteland. Being a good person only gets you so far. So I rather kill everything in one hit. Make sure I get a reward and my xp. 
---
What‚Äôs the worst that can happen? I get a thumbs down from other players and then somebody cries on reddit about it later?  My advice. Find yourself a good weapon. And instantly kill it. 
---
If you still want to be a good player, then build yourself a sub machine gun. Doesn‚Äôt matter what level. Just to guarantee that you can put a few bullets in it. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what type of build you are. Try to always have a light weapon that shoots a lot to guarantee you get rewards.
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is you like to antagonize people for fun.  Cool story man.
---
I added you too! I wanna swing by and check it out sometime. üôÇ
---
nice try bethesda marketing team, i see through your lies!
---
Spawn on the round building (air traffic control) at morgan town airport inside is 1 aid box it usually has a stim, climb the tower and jump and use the stim.
---
Head east and there is a small building with a cage in it it also has a first aid and chem box usually get 2 more stims there run back to tower jump and spam stims.
---
Usually get it first try worst case takes 3 matches if you get unlucky and get killed.
---
I've had two underground camps, It's fun making them, and fun to show them off to players. I have met a few trap camps, but never underground.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall
---
Ugh. That really sucks. I was on my own private server alone having just finished up powering up a plant. I got the fusion core machine going, had beat back the first defending quest, and then loading screen back to the main menu.
---
No cores for me.
---
Because I don't use fucking bubblegum. If I did, I would know where to get it.
---
Petiton to add a Gary flair
---
I am pretty sure you get 15 minutes may have been 5
---
Quite frankly I'd love to shoot a few of those annoying hippie chicks and farty grandpas.
---
The radio raider is, for me, the least annoying of the allies, but hey, what can you do, I hitched with Sophia so I have to listen to her complaining every damn day.
---
Was this on PC? I came across a camp extremely similar to this, believe it was selling serum recipes @ 4K caps.
---
What a well-made camp!
---
Effectively, no, there is no way to make a reliable spawn point. This issue is an ongoing massive pain. Often we visit someone's camp and get stuck in a wall, at a cliff far from the Camp, or in water. What a mess.
---
I'd take literally any stair with a platform that isnt the ugly wire mesh at this point.
---
It really cant be too much effort to put the AS floor textures on the platform of the 2x1 stairs, and its so highly requested
---
At my current camp location, I have her as my current ally. One day I loaded in and I had to settler wanderers in my camp. So I guess were my main lives is a location.
---
read the T.O.S again, it will clear things up for you.
---
That sucks. I‚Äôd love to sublet a private server for a few hours for some caps lol.
---
I'd love to play as assaultron infiltratron.
---
Dude idk where u live
---
I certainly hope they update the interface, but I haven't heard anything about it.
---
 didn't realize this was an option. Though that other person was right; there's good stuff to grab like the fusion cores and can chimes and such, so I don't mind going every day.
---
Using shop items to track time in the game is meaningless when they recycle atom shop items. I'm newer to the game, 2 months in, and have drooled over the greenhouse dome since I first saw it and guess what I bought this week? Bam. Greenhouse dome for the noob.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Water\_purifier\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Water_purifier_(Fallout_76))
---
I have leaded mods on 4 pieces of armor and Radshield favorited, I‚Äôm bloodied and can run out of a nuked zone no problem!
---
ask here. you never know.
---
Honestly, I think its a combination of either bugs dealing with it being online, CAMP budget stuff, and they may be too scared/afraid to mess with "old code". I have this sneaky suspicion that they just copy/pasted a majority of the CAMP code from Fo4. And that was either poorly made and/or not made well to be supported in an online environment. 
---
I mean the amount of things they can do with the CAMP system, both from stuff already in Fo4 and new things, is substantial. Yet there have been little to no updates to it. We have the same set of item types each Tuesday in the atom store and that's it. The premade buildings are about the biggest thing they've done.
---
True, but unless you‚Äôre running nuke launches constantly, and I know some people do, it‚Äôs still situation specific. A full set of Bolstering or Vanguard would probably give you more DR and ER than the troubleshooters, and the Secret Service armor has ridiculous stats.
---
I think LD can do magic, did you try it on some tougher enemies?
---
I really want to like it but I light someone up then they turn around and 3 shots later I'm dead.  I know I'm not good at NW but that gets frustrating.
---
I want to see the inside of their camps. Don't play a multi-player game if you dont want to see other players
---
Yeah I thought about that after the fact, if you‚Äôre looking at your map draw horizontal line from Hawkes Refuge west, and then draw an imaginary vertical line from the bee that‚Äôs SW of there north. Where those two lines intersect is pretty much where I‚Äôm camped. There‚Äôs an old Winnebago type structure and looks like an old dirtbike track around it
---
Your done for the season, all your challenges will still offer score but stlince your lvl 100 you'll be getting nothing meaning don't bother doing any more of the legendary run challenges.
---
A good place to check for a variety of plans would just be Whitesprings. There's several vendors and they're bound to have plenty. If not, server hop.
---
Crap... My stash is filling up way too quick then
---
Free atoms are gone.
---
Yeah. There should be.
---
Awww
---
Tried it out on some whitespring ghouls and seemed to one shot all of them without any type of shotgun perks
---
It‚Äôs also a random raider encounter location as well. Give them some resources for a little rep
---
Not to mention every team I get is full of people under level 5 that just hide all game and don't stick together
---
Just press back when it spawns u back to the respawn screen it‚Äôs a visual bug
---
Nice! I've got an adorable little setup near Arktos, but I'm getting itchy feet again.
---
If we're asking for stairs lets ask for some good ones
---
Ok I found [an article](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5AO20UhNUTb3WsBNM6fWXl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-ammo-converter-updates-purveyor-sale-and-more) on it after a google search.
---
It doesn't say anything about a date. It does say they'll be rolling out changes during the 'next update', but this article was from a couple weeks ago.
---
Google search will lead you in the right direction.  Several Reddit threads about it from last year.  Found some info but on mobile so cant easily post.
---
Just don't do it. It's as simple. I've never touched NW and skipped all NW challenges in score system. Lvl 63 score as of now.
---
I have been playing 2 years.i absolutely hate nw.it is a dumb mode that needs to go.i have played it up to lvl 25 and that was only for the rewards.other than that it's a waste of space.
---
ü•∫
---
Nuclear Winter is kinda dead in OCE so any NW challenges are a pain - I will usually put up with the wait time if the challenge is "Place a camp" or "Kill 1 creature" but thats really it. It doesn't incentivize me to play NW which is what the challenges should do.
---
They could fix it by adddin Bos//Enclave faction and randomly creating PvP zones with objectives on the map where people can participate inside.
---
 finally, someone with the guts to not skip leg day
---
Better if it was a mini nuke.
---
Have you exited that menu? I, for the first time in almost 2000hrs started encountering these spawn and FT bugs. The spawn issue looks like it puts you back on the respwan screen, but I press B(Xbox) to exit and I've really already respawned. Very weird.
---
I understand it's faster out, but the fun SBQ battles are the rare ones inside the blast zone.
---
I got lazy one time and bought 1 tech data just so it would spawn the quest. HAHA
---
Also have the pro, it finally just fixed itself
---
I thought magic weapons required a fire rate over 200.
---
Fr. I just waltz on inside lmao
---
Here's a few things I personally think would improve the mode a lot (aside from actually disabling any existing autoaims, wallhacks, speed/teleportation hacks, loot hacks and so on):
---
* Give us a proper solo mode, where everyone queues up solo, and where there are no groups.
---
* Remove the red visual indicators of enemies, as well as the crosshairs going red when you scan over an enemy.
---
* Start the game, with like a 5 second timer, only after everyone's client has sent a "I have loaded in 100%" -check to the server.
---
Other than that, making guns a bit more responsive, giving them a bit more range, making the draw range longer, and other small tweaks like that might make it quite enjoyable.
---
Just start a new character every week they level up way fast both for the new level up and LVL up challenges
---
What kills it for me is the trash inventory system. Completely wrong for a BR.
---
For an in-universe explanation, the reason we see plenty of settlement/CAMP objects that are in one game but not the other is the 200 year time gap. 76 features mainly pre-war dwellers, 25 years since the war. These people are practically living in pre-war limbo. In 2287, people are not rebuilding, they are just building. Architecture has changed in style and purpose
---
This is the only thing I have left to checkmark off on what I envisioned my main character as when the game was announced and details first started coming out! My favorite playthrough of 4 is one I did where I modded my character to be a ghoul and lead the Minutemen in saving the Commonwealth.
---
I am not sure you need to cause 100, 1000 or "x", to be honest. My unarmed ninja causes thousands, the same my bloodied commando... My my medic just might be causing 200-500 damage, throwing some arrows and sticking some syringes there. 
---
And I still get loot. Maybe being part of a team does the trick, maybe this, maybe that. Who knows. This is a game where everything is possible. 
---
Sometimes, I have to wait a minute or two before the queen is lootable. She falls down empty, and two minutes later, loot is there.
---
You mean their model was a scorched?
---
Yup, ridiculous bug that‚Äôs been here since WLs release, I get it 9 times out of 10
---
I think it's different for shotguns? i'm not completely sure though
---
I dont know where I usually see legendaries they have all ended up being diseased instead today. Like the diseased Deathclaw, diseased ghouls that you mentioned, diseased mega sloth, diseased honey beast, diseased wendingo, etc. Kinda sucks when im on a hunting team looking for legendaries.
---
Yes. I tried to respawned at an event but couldn‚Äôt move. I had Born Survivor perk on and my stim packs were being used up. I just turned off the console after a few minutes, and played Minecraft instead
---
You can go ahead and do that you know
---
I know, but you shouldn't be forced to make a new char to get the challenge done in time, just because you were active in the past.
---
Everytime I head in there fight about 20 Lvl62 Ghouls.  Good that you only have to do DMV mission once.
---
Just use a gatling laser, even better if it's ultracite. The ammo used is fusion cores which are super easy to get and it only takes 1-2 of them to reach the damage cap for getting loot from her even without any heavy weapon perks. I never waste my normal ammo on her. You can get 2 fusion cores in a matter of minutes passively by just capturing a power plant workshop, getting 1000+ rounds of other ammo is going to take much longer.
---
Red Dead is great but I am back playing Fo76. RDO was never interesting to me. Cyberpunk is single player so theres nothing to compare.
---
I can cause less damage than that and get rewards too. I read somewhere that the damage numbers are not real when eight ng the queen: you cause more damage (or less damage) because of DR and a visual bug.
---
I know, but at the same time i really want to have the content that offers the legendary run. Sadly, i dont have a lot of time or moment right now, so i have to choose between those 2 things.
---
&gt; The only problem is, now that I'm done, the urge to pack up and move so I can build somewhere else is creeping up on me.
---
I know that feeling so well, which is why I personally wish we could have like 3-5 slots into which we could save an entire C.A.M.P. blueprint. We can save and transfer entire settlements in Fallout 4, so it's definitely mechanically doable within this engine. The existing blueprint system just doesn't help at all if you want to properly save the entire C.A.M.P. just the way you've built it.
---
If we could save a few different entire C.A.M.P. blueprints, we could build the perfect place for ourselves and then pack it up and go try building elsewhere knowing that we can actually return to the one we already built. And, without doing it all on an alt.
---
Also, on the topic of transfering settlements in Fallout 4, imagine being able to save your C.A.M.P. blueprint, and then being able to trade it with another player. Wouldn't that be awesome?
---
Happens to me every time in uranium fever. Some player WILL get blasted in the face.
---
Don't even try, man.
---
Yeah I'm relatively far 2, somewhere between 55 and 65. But cool to encounter a real pacifist player.
---
In crowded events I‚Äôve started hitting legendaries with the butt of my gun. I do minimal damage and everyone else gets there shot.
---
I will eventually abandon the stealth suit just so I can wear this.
---
Yeah, since the update for whatever reason the game and the console just aren‚Äôt talking to each other properly. I had one blue screen crash for the 4 months I‚Äôve been playing, then that update came out and there went stability lol.
---
This is the only game I get those blue screen crashes on.
---
Was it on Xbox cuz this exact thing happened last night to me. Level 19 (I think) jumped in while I was shooting them down.
---
Hahaha Bethesda it happend again it's not my internet it's your game
---
I'm guessing the "magic" has to do with having a large number of hits within a small timeframe. I believe the shotgun you have should work but I've noticed that they can be a bit inconsistent.
---
I tend to just play the game and the score points happen while I‚Äôm playing
---
Sorry, she either has a headache or is having nightmares about floating in space.
---
Is it though, plenty of flat ground in the forest.
---
i'll try it out, thanks though!
---
That‚Äôs is true. But taking that into account we would assume that the people living 200 years apart would not have evolved much, if any, neurological wise. 
---
So anyone who could think of building that in fo4 could possibly have seen it as a smart idea in 76 as well. 
---
But yeah I hear you tho.
---
 Same here, its weird
---
I had this bug and it got progressively worse the more i tried to fix it i fast traveled to my camp in a attempt to fix it and the camera angle got stuck in the feet and when i ran it was horrifying as the camera would like tilt side to side as you sprinted.
---
Same. My favourite thing to do with no plotline quests is play house.
---
Maybe you join the brotherhood and fly away to places to do missions on collecting rare tech
---
It does crash and freeze fairly often.
---
Nobody force you lol
---
Every time I try to claim her workshop, she says she has a headache
---
One of the Tadpole/Pioneer quests is to kill a Yao Gui with the syringer.  Good luck with that though.
---
So it‚Äôs a subscription only bug. lol
---
Yes, you won't regret it.
---
There are some good videos on YouTube that will help you out.
---
Yea my favorite place farm xp and get some legendaries but lately people been jumping in there grabbing my kills when I was already faeming it so rip
---
God I want to do this event
---
Psst I just learned you can make a low level alt use him to get your level and go about ur business in nw too
---
I don't think you get what I mean. This one Challenge "rank up your Overseer Rank" should be a Weekly instead of a daily.
---
Haha what happened? Just get booted off the server?
---
Get shotgun, better yet instigating shotgun and use vats. Get lots of int and use granberry relish and brain fungus soup. Get some agility for sneak with some perk cards for sneak and more demage from silenced weapons and put a silencer on ur shotgun. You can get some easy legendary items from a quest called leader of the pack nw map, pops up all the time.  Sneaking and shotguning in vats at whitesprings, I was one shotting everything at level 15. Got to 50 in no time.
---
It's about the NW Levels, not the ones in Adventure.
---
Oh I‚Äôm glad you said that. I have 818 script and was about to use it all on guns. Turns out I have to buy legendary modules and vault steel!!!!  Lol
---
Yes but spam clicking boiled water was my second get a level thing.
---
Yeah like 4 times today ik I'm making a big deal about it but I really does need to stop
---
And more knickknacks
---
I had 2 bloodied characters for a few months, one power armor / heavy and a sneak commando build. Sure the damage is good but I have no plans going back to it. Just was not worth the hassle to me anymore.
---
Any specific person / video you think I should look at?
---
Those are the best
---
You sound like a real stand up guy. Maybe you can be a guidance counselor for these snowflakes one day
---
Right, but you can‚Äôt use Gatling lasers till level 25; this is Def a more efficient route but won‚Äôt work until you can use them.
---
Try using dodgy instead for the moment, make you more tankier and it's pretty good for PA as well.
---
Oh no don't tell me this is back.
---
In the dark early days of 76 I would be scrapping a whole bunch of weapons and the highlighting cursor would disappear... but something was scrapped. Was it armour? Scrap? Who knows! Because it certainly wasn't on the tab on the screen!
---
I want my own permanent vox syringer so I can tlak to animals when om bored and want someone to talk to. Maybe the mission should drop vox syringer plans....
---
When a player logs off, their ally has to go somewhere!
