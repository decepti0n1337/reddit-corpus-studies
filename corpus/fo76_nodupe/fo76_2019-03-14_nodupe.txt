[Ps4] Is anyone else having to wait 100+ hours to launch your next nuke? My two friends are experiencing long waits like this now too since the update. 
---
---
---
Today we get the quest that leads to the Brewing crafting station. More quests will be added, but not today 
---
Yeah I‚Äôd like to see half the items that are in the nukacola room in the one fraternity house in the new quests. I really liked the spinning light and giant nukacola bottle
---
Seriously I love this little glitch, i hope they never fix it :)
---
Is there a source for this?
---
Wow. That's the best you got? My kids got sicker burns then you. 
---
This has NEVER been fixed, been there since day one.
---

---
Bethesda can nerf their little titties off &amp; add brewing but cant fix annoying bugs like this.
---
Me and a mate have to log out of the game an average of 2-3 times a night because of this issue.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
yeah i still have a bunker on 1 of my characters. i just cant change anything or add to it. 
---
Lol BGS just baiting us to do defend missions. 
---
I got it !! Went excited to see them and it was only those pesky little spider bots 
---
I have an anti armor explosive ultracite MG42. Its disgusting. I‚Äôm pretty sure I can kill God with this thing. 
---
Fixed it.

That's strange. I just checked the holotape, and I'm showing Alpha and Bravo with no cooldown, and a 2:15 wait time on Charlie because it was just used.
---
drink some nukashine and lighten up pal
---
Yikes lol
---
Christ you‚Äôre toxic.  Let people enjoy things. 
---
They also fixed a slough of bugs and exploits (no more foundation houses for example), along with the new content. There were no less than 30 bugs that were addressed in today's patch.

---
Gay
---
I read that it is, but I'm not sure with the budget
---
I haven't been playing this game lately, mostly just wasn't in the mood for it more than anything else, but I'll definitely be swinging back through with this patch. My cowgirl character can now make her own booze to carry out on her hunting expeditions!
---
We also checked Holo tapes but they we're all ready to go. Maybe anyone who has never launched can do one. Need to find us a virgin. I'll happily guide them thru the silo and give them a card. 
---
I never realized they weren't expiring üòÇ
---
How much cheese is too much cheese? 
---
But can you milk Graham??
---
My level is embarrassingly high. I farm apparel 
---
Go leave and be unhappy then.
---
Same.  Charisma 1.
---
Great find guys! That is definitely new from the patch. 
---
I never came back that's the point lol
---
No. Read the patch notes.
---
They could also add an inner ring to the quick inventory wheel with 2-5 customized perk loadouts. Console players could use L3 to switch between the inner and outer rings. 
---
Blame Microsoft and Sony. The PC version has differential patching while the consoles don't. PC is 13 GB though so not a huge difference.
---
Imagine saying 7 GB is not a lot to somebody in 1990.
---
And it matches my interior! (I use the barn walls as interior walls!)
---
Disgusting as in your upset? Or are you are in disbelief? I‚Äôm personally glad, excited to check it out later.
---
What songs have you heard? I always listen to the radio so I'll tell you if they're new or not.
---
But you like to come to the sub in your free time. Nothing else to do?
---
...Holy shit, I am going to actually buy atoms.
---
Is that Deezer's dad or something.
---
I just installed them today after the patch. It is not working for me :(
---
I am still unable to input any code on the keypad.
---
Go to ¬†&lt;Documents Folder&gt;\My Games\Fallout 76\ and delete the ¬†Fallout76Custom.ini file. 
---
Uhm, but there is new content added with this patch.. New crafting station, underground areas, loot, missons.. 
---
Makes me want buy the game again ! And I own 2 copy's already
---
Use common sense buddy
---
How many rads and how many caps? 
---
Dont think so, just saw it one day when I was doing a plastic run.
---
Loaded it up and fast traveled to an event and crashed immediately to Xbox home screen. Loaded back up and played about an hour no problems and ran a lot smoother than Tuesday! Waiting til the weekend to do the new stuff 
---
Disgusting as in good. It tears through enmities now and doesn‚Äôt waste 50-70 rounds to kill a single enemy. 
---
Yeah my boyfriend and I are constantly logging out to fix this or else we are just yelling at each other trying to stick together and figure shit out. It is a really aggravating bug. 
---
Epic armour skins and as a collector of everything Nuka Cola relay=ted those signs are top of my list now.
---
Odd, well still that‚Äôs pretty cool. Weird, but cool 
---
So you have nothing better to do then. Gotcha 
---
So, yet another patch ignoring the social issues my girlfriend and I experienced every single day since launch (multiple tickets were submitted and ignored) until we quit on the day patch 5 was released. Those issues made it impossible for us to play together at some point every single play session, and the only workaround is to quit the whole game on both consoles and pray to "God" Howard that it works. When will these ever get fixed? If you don't fix the shit that got people to quit playing in the first place, how will you ever entice us to come back and spend money on Atoms? Don't bother responding, your community manager already knows my support tickets were ignored. She ignored the problem too, just like I expected she would.
---
It's not a camp item, they mean that there is now stash boxes in the enclave bunker for you to use.
---
Found oil and acid deposits dotted throughout the area as well.
---
Also, did you ever get the bug where you just get massive radiation for no fucking reason? 
---
Christ, I hope that‚Äôs ‚Äúin game hours‚Äù.  Cause If it‚Äôs IRL, no ones nukin anything for at least a week. 
---
Oh. That‚Äôs good too!
---
[removed]
---
What's your point you're doing the exact same thing
---
It used to exist but has now been taken away for some reason. An oversight hopefully.
---
I can see where you're coming from.
---
The "phasing" in WoW was a Mists of Pandaria change though. That was when they started merging the servers and implementing group finders. Before that you could see whoever was near you on your server, and it could get CRAZY. Especially in Org. (I heard the same about SW, but Horde for life so. Filthy Alliance dogs.)
---
Hmm, even stranger. The guy who launched on our server was level 120 something, so I guess it could have been his first, but it seems unlikely.
---
Do you have mothman billboard? Can you compare?
---
I‚Äôm active on a sub of a game I enjoy. You are here for some other reason.
---
A doctor won't do anything but refer them to a psychiatrist or psychologist but will still make him pay for the visit just to be told to go elsewhere.
---
A Buddhist Monk...  Hell, dude, human to human, if you know any Buddhist Monks willing to sit with and teach a mentally ill person (me) how to find some inner peace, *well then shut up and take my caps damn it!  And then unshut up and tell me where!  I demaand it!*
---
Seriously though, people abuse scientists for trying to do their jobs, people abuse victims for basically being victims.  Of all the things and people to tell that they have unhealthy aggression (and believe me when I say that *I do*), I don't think complaining about people ruining a game should be high up on things to judge a person about.  Not like he's encouraging scientists to abandon research into chronic conditions effecting millions, or for parents to put their children at risk of serious diseases because they distrust vaccines, or claiming the earth is flat and denouncing anyone as delusional morons for not believing otherwise.  He's not encouraging people to starve over eating GMO products.
---
Naw man, you're just as judgmental as he is, as I am, as anyone is.  That doesn't demand mental help, that demands we actually look inwardly at *why* we're so judgmental.
---
For instance, I want to express gratitude for this patch, but I'm so judgmental of Bethesda I expect a bunch of new things to go wrong from their sheer incompetence they've displayed, yet they patched many things bugging me out badly in this game that I'm grateful for them doing so (even though those things shouldn't have been there to begin with.)
---
It's hard being positive in some situations for some people.  You can tell someone to go see a doctor, but it's not like you're going to help them do so or pay for the visit they can't afford.
---
What's a person to do??
---
Grafton Steel mutant glitch. I have a similar Pic. 
---
Unfortunately it's still better to sneak when afk in your CAMP, it allows you to be hidden from the overmap.
---
I do support this change though as I often afk in a bed as well within a locked "panic room". I will stash my junk then go to bed then take care of my irl things. I don't care if someone wants to come check out my CAMP and I have yet to really run into a problem with people messing me up while I am away. I'm sure this is a more common problem being near a popular area or resource as I've been attacked a couple of times when my base was across from the Pleasant Valley station (Top of the World). 
---
For bug fixes and small features and for the next upcoming new content
---
I thought it was a thing before, but yeah I hope so too. Luckily I wasn't looking at anything I knew I'd want, but I'd be really sad if I paid the crazy amount they vendors want for legendaries for it to be dumb effects. 
---
Yeah I want all of that 
---
Player Vending doesn‚Äôt come until the April 9th update and the Legendary vendor arrives May 23, if you take a look at the roadmap it lays out all the schedules updates for the springs DLC.
---
This conversation was before the patch went live. That's what version I was referring to 
---
Disable Mods
---
Please read roadmap
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure those features aren‚Äôt live yet 
---
I'd be happy if they would at least confirm or deny their availability so we could all stop wasting our time server hopping. Same with x-01 calibrated shocks. 
---
sitting around, random spawn
---
You do know you can bash things you like right? lol
---
The update is coming out over a period of time rather than all at once. I don't know why they show it all coming out now when it isn't. Here's the roadmap for the update. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Think you mean geniuses.
---
The problem with that is then you cant control what messages people say to eachother. If you let people make their own voice lines, people will get carried away with mean and profane messages. There is always area voice chat, you just gotta have a mic and a push to talk button.
---
I've always though a custom graffiti message would be sweet, something to write on walls with.  
---
Look at blizzards games for reference;

welcome to vault 65
---
COUNTRY ROADS, TAKE ME HOME, TO THE PLACE I BELOOOONNNNGGGGGGG, WEST VIRGINIA, MOUNTAIN MAMA, TAKE ME HOME, COUNTRY ROADS
---
Maybe it has something to do with the amount and duration of high level players in the area. I personally didn't experience this today I'm only LV. 45 and only used my sword as I helped a LV. 19 through the quest 
---
AFK timer is like 30 minutes. 25% of that is 7.5 minutes. Honestly it could of been 200% longer. 
---
Next content is hidden. 
---
That's incredibly annoying then.
---
&gt;  (I refuse to call these people Bethesda, they haven't earned that pedigree) 
---
Goddamn that's both stupid and pathetic.
---
Alright so I wasn't sure how it worked exactly before but I've crafted a fermented nukashine on PC if you want me to try and trade it to you?  Or anyone probably if I don't respond in a timely manner. 
---
"Insult added"???? Haha did it add a new emote or something....? Quite curious, please check the wheel for us! 
---
I have no mods installed for 76 (never got around to it).
---
Yes and it sucks considering we have gigabit of space
---
I'm with you there, and there better be Fasnatch donuts as well, it's a major part of the whole celebration.
---
also your reddit thread doesn't have a single mention of the health regeneration or enemy mutation thing.  So I invite you to provide different proof. I see legendary tables, chances, and good tips and tricks. but nothing specifically refuting what i'm saying (also nothing specifically refuting what you're saying either) 
---
Almost 40mins of AFK is pretty good if you ask me. Don't forget at one point it was only 10mins!
---
It went down 100 points for me
---
It was never advertised as an MMO. Some youtuber called it one and now everyone is stuck with that descriptor. It's a Fallout Prequel, and it happens to be online, because without the other players wandering around and interacting with you the storyline of this game would have made the world so very empty. I live the story, don't get me wrong, and I understood the complete lack of NPCs from the get-go; everyone is dead, except those of us that came from the vault. Which are all the player characters. Great concept, imho.
---
Its nice that they're at least trying. I've avoided energy/heavy build because I'm a VATS player and know how damage works.
---
Heavy/Energy Weapons need a massive overhaul. Fixing base damage, adding more modifications, and improving AP usage so these weapons can be used in VATS. so that players can get the massive damage/accuracy boost from VATS when they have AP.
---
I think the DEVs need to rethink how they are testing these weapons. The only thing that makes sense as to why the damage is so stupidly low, is that all testing is done on AI-less ragdolls, and not while in DANGER.
---
Bug fixed...
---
I think you pointed the camera a little too far off. It needs to be on me! ;) My spacesuit is more super cool than a vault! (jokes) 
---
Yeah. Overall spotting a few new things so far since the patch. No clue if it old or not. At least other vaults mark themselves. This one did not though.
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Yeah my bloodied is like 100 damage now. Thats really nice. 
---
No you‚Äôre dragging workshops into this equation man. If he were to claim a workshop and kill the owner then I highly doubt that person would seek revenge 10 times in a row. 
---
This is about people who initiate PvP or have bounties but don‚Äôt have any caps on them. The debuff you get for being bankrupt is not enough and needs to be fixed. 
---
This scenario might play out 0.5% of the time in a workshop scenario but by no means is that the premise here. We all agree that if you take a workshop and kill the owner and they have no caps that‚Äôs not a big deal. Quit trying to bring your workshop beliefs into this argument. Let PvP players have a discussion without being a baby about it smh. 
---
Haha. I was reading the damn terminal and wooosh
---
20 crafting benches excluding the fermenter (1only)
---
I think we need a sticky post reminding people to consider any mods they have running before complaining about technical issues. It seems like a lot of people just forget about them by the time a new patch rolls around.
---
Well, if you can't use the core game mechanics with other players simultaneously, and only interact with them in specific places, the game only has an MMO-Hubs. The game itself isn't played as an MMO, so how can it be an MMO? If that makes any sense. 
---
I am finally low 50s. A level 6 stumbled upon my camp and I rolled in with PA and I just hear, "please don't kill me." I chuckled, dropped a bag full of plans and said, "take these plans." He was worried about payment, and i was like, "i dont need anything, unless you got razorgrain." he didn't. I ended up modding his existing armor and i left to explore some more while he probably took all my purified water outside. i don't mind. i purposely leave them unlocked.
---
Here's the thing, generally your camp is pretty safe from griefers, just log if it starts getting destroyed. 
---
I was but I deleted them. Do I have to change ini file or something?
---
Should note it had some stimpacks, and dodgeballs, and a lot plastic bowls sitting outside of it. No clue if always the same when going up to it. Butwe didn't spot a note. Then again may have missed it.
---
The answer is yes. But I, myself, will be rebuilding my base again when I get the chance due to all the new changes. I want to start from scratch and hopefully utilize the new features to their fullest potential. Plus in the past I've had a few items go ghost and the only way to recover the phantom budget is to move and replace your CAMP. 
---
Every game needs that one challenging area that gives you the best loot the game has to offer
---
Not to hijack a thread but is this game worth picking up now? I really enjoy the fallout atmosphere was thinking about picking this game up.
---
Launched today
---
The last update for Wild Applachia in May adds the underground areas.
---
But I never have acid...
---
Can't they use GPS?
---
The damage has increased on most of my weapons.
---
Thanks for the data. Obviously the patch notes were a little more generic than reality but it looks a lot like what they said. 10% buff to some semi-auto energy weapons and a reconfiguration of damage for heavy weapons (more damage less fire rate = should be better for DR issues and weapon condition). 
---
Yea, has something to do with the ini. I don‚Äôt know the specifics but have read multiple posts about it. Scroll trough a bit and you‚Äôll see them. 
---
They also fixed at least 30 bugs and exploits.
---
Ugh. 
---
Sure. But id rather spend my energy enjoying stuff I like. How is that treating you? You seem like a joyful fellow.
---
Hookedonphonics.Com the patch notes
---
An hour if you take your time. 15 m if you rush (and you have ingredients already)
---
I'd like to know more!
---
You are off your rocker friend. Try some nukashine and feel some bliss
---
Or I can put nuka cola to chill 
---
I like variety.
---
I try to be helpful on my alt lvl100 account I barely play anyone with on and try to team up or give loot, but these lvl1-25's are like "how 'bout I don't die" even though I try to help them. On my main which is almost lvl50, and everyone wants help. Did not expect the fear the some people have of high levels.
---
I got a brahmin
---
I had already seen the roadmap, forgot about it, and thought everything in the video was being added to day.
---
I just launched a nuke at Charlie 
---
I saw this as I logged off for the night having done the brewing mission... cannot wait for tomorrow!! üëçüòÖ
---
&gt;You can't say you buffed Energy weapons when you only touched 55% of them!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;AND you can't really call 2-4 more points of Damage on the Pistols/Rifles a Buff! You could DOUBLE their damage and they still wouldn't hold up to other guns like the Handmade! Especially considering that so many creatures have higher Energy Resistance!  
---
&gt;You guys really need to listen to the actual feedback on this stuff, and not just hear that there is feedback and guess on how to fix things!
---
That's pretty whiney.
---
The only one here that seems to be 'whining like an entitled prick' is you honestly...
---
Two questions:
---
1. Is this legit?
---
2. If so where is the stash box?
---
Im going to yes myself now: to shew off the r/inclusiveor team.
---
I haven‚Äôt found one you know any good discord servers
---
Funny how you deleted your entitled statements from the post before replying with that. Your attempt at backtracking is a failure. No disproportionate comments were made on my part. Though it appears you deleted all of yours... Thanks for more lulz?
---
Yep me talking to 20+ people and a discord, those who did it got the timer, those who didn't can launch just fine with no timer.
---
The entire premise of the story is that everyone but those of us in the vault are dead or Scorched. We even have to go get inoculated against the plague, just to reinforce the concept that something really terrible happened while we were in the vault. If you read the notes and listen to the holos it clearly lays this concept out.
---
If you give yourself to Mothman he will lift you out of purgatory on his gossamer wings. Praise be onto him!

Hiw do i start it? ..feeling dumb lol
---
Be sure to follow [this recipe](https://m.wikihow.com/Make-Milk-Steak-With-Jelly-Beans) 
---
Just make ENERGY piercing perks.
---
Dont ask beth for armor pen on energy weapons, they will give it to us
---
Happened to me tonight also just once but I downloaded the update loaded into my camp for a couple of minutes and fast traveled to an event and hard crashed to Xbox home screen. This has never happened in 130hrs to me either... Hope it was a fluke...
---
Um. Yes. Yea they did.
---
It's not the code that I had issues with, its the fact that the keypad was on the inside of the wall instead of the outside
---
Alright cool, thank you!
---
They fixed several major bugs and exploits, smoothed over some features, and added new content.
---
/u/valseek since the Xbox patch today, we can no longer click the right stick to see the legendary effects on weapons/armor in the vendor window. Is this being fixed, or is it intended?
---
&gt; increased your odds of a rep actually providing feedback.
---
Don't need or want any more BS feedback. Actual fixes only, pls &amp; thx.
---
we gonna get energy piercing legendary affix's also? 
---
im fine with more perks cuz theres literally 0 difference. 
---
A 10% buff is a shit ton. 
---
Here is what I got. Checking Robco building now. http://imgur.com/PhPmt16
---
Someone earlier posted that some mods may be doing this. If you use mods, you might want to update them or uninstall for now.
---
Much sadness üòî 
---
Wendigo - yes. 
---
Overseer - not sure....
---
Where can I find a list of what can't roll on weapons?
---
I‚Äôve never been interested in heavy weapons, but sounds like it‚Äôs still disappointing. 
---
Vintage radio! ‚ô•
---
Mucking FODUS
---
I think batteries included reducing fusion core weight would be better than porta power. Personally i planned on getting aqua boy early and am level 107 or something and haven't found a need for it.  Sun kissed i love to swap in during day if needed.  I like to run class freak to reduce my negative mutation affects and stranger in numbers when grouped.  I do in fact run a vats sniper build so way different.  Just my thoughts
---
Same! I had 2 missile turrets and maxed budget, now I have 10 missile turrets and half budget used. Fantastic update, except for only one artillery piece limit. I liked 8. Needs buffed.
---
Or 10
---
I have put some cash in when the patch actually fixed stuff and didn't break things badly, that's my plan for this one as well and so far the only stumbling block to my rewarding them is the multiple disconnects i got this morning in the first 3 hours, 5 in total. Hoping it was just the rush of players returning and it will have stabilized by now. But time to head back to Appalachia and make some shine.
---
Yeah my inventory mod stopped working after the update so I got rid of it and just finished a scan/repair. Fingers crossed this works!
---
143 hour cool down here. 
---
Don't complain about my alcoholic role playing. 
---
What?!?
---
Well, I mean, i was being sarcastic as I'm sure you are too, I was hoping that there might be a slim chance that he really didn't realise he was being so aggressive and savage and maybe I could play a part in shaping the rest of his life from here on in, maybe he could've gone on to shoot up a school if I hadn't intervened, maybe there's another human somewhere that may just have a slightly better life from now on because of my comment and he'll be less aggressive towards them from now on, that was my dream, my vision. 
---
Nice catch, glad I wasn't the only one who knows the classics of SciFi.
---
They are supposed to be rolling out new stuff for Wild Appalachia every week.
---
Step one: find a time machine
---
Step two: set it for ~~Summer 2019~~ ~~Winter 2019~~ Sometime in 2020 if you're feeling lucky.
---
Bugs smashed. Weapons balanced. Exploits fixed. Content added. Some of you will just never be happy.
---
I look forward to finding all of your CAMPS just to turn the radio off. 
---
It‚Äôs STILL FUCKING BUGGED WITH SiN @#7&amp;=#@)
---
You got the drops from the other poster who reported 0 drops lol.
---
As a matter of course Bethesda should always validate existing files on update even if they are not changed by the patch. Updates can break mods in ways that look like it's a problem with the game.
---
Yeah playing a month and a half 4 months after the game came out doesn't make you right. The ppl that's not blind been here day one backwards gun holding enemies, tons of crashes, enemies not even noticing you're standing next to them, loot not spawning, camp getting pulled up every 4th game, quest not running correctly, building not loading in, shit I can go on for days there's a 2 hour video of the constant bugs. And that's not including the copy and paste quest with a different name. Don't get me wrong I was a Bethesda fallout fanboy and this game broke that mindset. I'll give you that one disconnections was rare.
---
Super mutants can spawn with some kitted out Assault Rifles that can sell for nearly 100 caps.
---
Energy weapons are such trash few people use them so I'm sure most have far more ammo then they have a use for.
---
That's rough it just seems like a quest tutorial, almost like the rad shield quest line. I was hoping for an in depth quest, something to actually add to the game
---
That site hasn't been great for me personally.
---
Usually you have to get the next level up instead of skipping levels.
---
I have a three star explosive LMG that I have been holding onto hoping for this day.
---
Can't wait to log in laters and give it a whirl, I can't even remember what the other two effects were it's been in the stash so long.
---
This is going to be great.
---
yes, but they are the old school 3d red/blue lenses
---
Almost a 19 GB patch for me. 6 hour download time Hoooooo!
---
There are a million posts about this already. Do a search to find the solution and get ready for downvoted
---
That sounds vaguely familiar, you might be right. 
---
There aren't any vaults that you can actually enter yet in the game right? 
---
Here's some little tips i guess. 
---
* I generally never use pack rat because if you die you loose your junk if someone takes it. So its best to store all your junk and never carry a lot around. 
---
* If you want to be Queen ready i would suggest the "Blocker" perk. 45% melee damage reduction makes it so you can take a ton of damage. Even the queen will hardly scratch you if your in power armor. 
---
* Invest in "Adamantium Skin" if you do not use power armor. 
---
The setup looks really good for a rifle power armor user. Just depends your play-style and what you like to do. 
---
You've yet to really provide an actual argument as to why Scorchbeasts should not give good loot, you've merely said "well, um, *I* find ammo really easily so it can't be that much of a waste" and "well teeeeechnically no game ever promises you good loot so...", both of which are blatat strawmans pulled for your pseudo philosophical viewpoint.
---
If you take out the reward, the risk becomes unnecessary, thus taking away quite literally all the incentive to do something in the first place. "If I fight this monster I might die and lose all the scrap I've been collecting, but I have a chance of getting something good" is a lot better than "If I fight this monster I might die and lose all the scrap I've been collecting". For a videogame to incentivise combat it needs to have... Actual incentive.
---
This isn't entitlement or neediness, this is basic logic. If destroying the One Ring had no positive outcomes, we wouldn't have Lord of the Rings. If blowing up the Death Star was only gonna give the Rebels some XP, Star Wars wouldn't exist. If creating electricity had no genuine benefits, nobody would have done so.
---
Value may be subjective, but the risk/reward ratio on Scorchbeasts is highly skewed.
---
&gt; a system that is supposed to reward us for winning against people
---
PVP by nature involves risks. Among those risks are the possibility  losing caps if you lose or the possibility of getting zero caps  if you win.
---
That's the nature of it.
---
I found him up in the mire
---
Jesus christ some of you whine SO MUCH. 
---
That's a LOT to implement in one patch. 18.697 GB for the playstation 4 worth of patch.
---
Didn‚Äôt work üò≠ guess I‚Äôll play anthem üôÑ
---
So because bethesda didn‚Äôt handle the duper‚Äôs and cheaters in time, and they can‚Äôt code their shit servers correctly and have to use stash limits, I‚Äôm going to lose hours of time farming mats and putting them on mules to craft and unlock weapon mods.  Last Bethesda game I ever purchase. Glad I only paid 12$. 
---
Thats what i had to do. To bad the download takes a while. Still, the servers are probably lagging today since a lot of people are playing
---
Kek, imagine if out of nowhere they added a Diablo rifts-like procedural underground cave system.
---
shiet
---
think it was just a bunch of glowies. i have camo x-01 with dark color helm
---
1000+s for a need for darker nights, bright blue sky at midnight doesn't cut it for me either.  My monitor is properly calibrated as well, I can't change anything without making daylight look like crap.  Since modder's can't do it at this time (and probably never on public servers), PLEASE give us an ingame option to make it darker.
---
Survival isnt even out yet. 
---
The trailer was slightly misleading. Those features are yet to be introduced to the game.
---
[here ya go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasnacht_\(doughnut\))
---
Lol. Thanks. Every now and then, a pun "just works" eh eh. See what I did there. 
---
An altered ini file is doing it. If all else fails move the Fallout76custom.ini file or rename it. Look in documents/my games/fallout76 for it. There's a fix on nexus for some mids. Check perk Loadout Manager for more info 
---
Lol. You have to twist my words so much to add all this meaning and tone and suggestive intent.
---
When people do that, which is basically lying. That means they are wrong. 
---
Before you could get a lot more damage at 5-10% hp.
---
Obvious? If no one read the roadmap(which a shit load of people obviously haven't) then there is nothing obvious about it....
---
I've stayed on world to go look and my camp space is empty. Then I rebuilt it with the campfires 4-5 more times and tested and same issue. Then I build a CAMP in the same spot not using that exploit (which after today's patch isn't valid anymore) and no more problems. So, definitely an issue with the campfire trick.
---
It‚Äôs mods for fucks sake. There have been WAY too many posts about this today. 
---
Where does the quest start?
---
Pacifist mode is still in game settings.
---
I dunno. They overemphasize the wacky element too much. But that‚Äôs a matter of taste. 
---
Too punny
---
I'm having this issue as well, so I'm hoping that's the reason. Cheers for relaying that info.
---
Ahhh ok. I already uninstalled and it‚Äôs reinstalling now. Should fix the ini file. Longest way possible of fixing, but still.
---
Did no one actually read the fucking roadmap?
---
I seriously looked 5 different times and it wasn't there, but now, in a huff, I check again and it's there. Am I having a stroke? O.o
---
I'm level 22 at the moment and really only had 2 bad experiences. I said "Look at this asshole" near a level 100's guy when I was about level 10. He killed me. I didn't know he heard me, lol.
---
When I was about level 15, I started getting shot in the back by a level 9 guy. I turned around and returned fire, but he killed me. I'm no good at games like COD or Fortnite, ect so I'm just nice to people these days.
---
Is the daily quest achievable ? How do we get that drink when we can't make it yet?
---
Ah, so you're the wife. Lovely, carry on.
---
Pretty smooth service for me on xbox servers. 
---
Agreed. I'm looking forward to the new substantial sounding content and like the fixes, but it's a bit early to be throwing out praise imo, it comes out like people are trying to convince themselves - I came back today after some time out and the only new stuff was a half-hour fetch quest with some newish drinks craft-able. Fine, but nothing revelatory.
---
&gt; we chose to not be savages who trample on the small guys
---
This.
---
We need to sticky this. I have no idea how so many people are confused. 
---
Sounds like A bug tbh
---
Seems like a lot of time to waste just for weapon mods anyway tbh
---
I love leather personally and think it is very capable of being useful in the late game for builds that mostly kill stuff before it gets to them, but occasionally one or two get through.
---
Went there once, no issue. Xb1.
---
FWIW I've enjoyed it even before the update (which I haven't had the chance to play yet), and I have always been more disappointed with F4. I consider myself somewhat picky when it comes to games; if I'm going to invest this much time into something, I have to be getting something out of it.
---
Any chance did you trade for the gun? Or someone dropped it and you picked it up? 
---
They always had give dots
---
Yes! It's a different FO experience, but you'll find a familiar love for this game. 
---
Great job on this update Bethesda! 
---
Am I the only one who gets pissed at these patch notes? Were 4 months after release and they're just now fixing typos on challenges.
---
I did, but when I suddenly had no access to toggle Pacifist Mode I grew concerned about it. I could be forgiven for assuming BGS broke some damn thing, like they do. In this case I was just impaired. Derp.
---
5 star as been there but not obtainable 
---
Same here. What are you doing when you crash? I was in the middle of picking a lock, eating food, drinking drinks..
---
cool
---
All damage goes through a critical modifier.
---
All weapons have a built in 1.0x critical modifier. Weapon mods can add to this critical modifier. Being in danger subtracts 0.5 from the critical modifier. So when you're in DANGER, weapons do 1/2 base damage.
---
Not that. Survival mode was never coming out today. It‚Äôs set for release later.
---
Are you on pc?
---
If your camp starts getting destroyed, switch servers immediately to mitigate the damage.  Also, this won't be a thing soon. A future update will make it so that pacifist mode extends to your camp.
---
Well so is playing around radioactive cracks in the earth but here we are.
---
I keep falling through the map, can only get so far away from any location and fall.
---
Phasing was actually in since beta, but was only used when you died. Ghosts were phase shifted to the living. They just expanded on it later in WotLK for quests (untouched village would be phase 1, torched village phase 2, and depending where you were on the quest, you'd phase into 1 or 2 on approach, and to observer you would just fade out). This was painful when you are chasing someone on a PvP server, and they suddenly vanish because they had a Scarlet Tournament quest and you didn't. And yes, eventually they expanded that into servers also.
---
It's not necessarily a bad thing, it does save from server crashes. Back in the good old days, like you said, 100-200 Horde show up outsode of Ironforge, and 100-200 Alliance pour out through that gate to defend, and the server goes boom, and stays down for a few hours. Phasing helped with that a little bit. But it does break the MMO feel quite a bit.
---
EVE is genuinely magical and (I think) unique in this respect. It's single-shard (no separation by servers), and no phasing. If you go to X, Y, Z coordinates and any other player goes to X, Y, Z, you will absolutely see each other. Even if one player is cloaked, going to X, Y, Z will break cloak by proximity, and you will still see them. In WoW, this wasn't always the case. Initially it was by-server, and later on by-phase separation also. But typically this only kicks in when an instance gets overloaded.
---
Other games, like Age of Conan, would just create straight up copies, which felt a lot worse. I'd be talking to a friend, asking him where he is, he'd say he is on the docks in Khopshef, but I can't see him. Turns out he's in Khopshef 23 and I'm in Khopshef 47. We could still manually switch, but it was a pain in the arse.
---
Look up your mods. Every update needs another update.
---
The problem with this it's the implication that not being a proper MMO is a "wrongbad" situation when is is in fact  a "rightgreat" one!  ;)
---
I think this has already been acknowledged as a bug by Bethesda
---
So it's still not obtainable?
---
You forgot to mention platforn
---
Not yet 
---
They‚Äôre bringing my radio back!! About time!
---
I hope so. I didn't see anything on it, if there was I missed it.
---
Level? And was it your first? 
---
Headshots are the primary tip I would give, and making use of the excessive amounts of explosives the game throws at you. Molotovs deal decent burst damage and then moderate DoT, and the DoT stacks, so save up those beer bottles and make a bunch of cocktails. Then headshot a few of them down while you can, and when they start to swarm you or your AP gets low start lobbing Molotovs until your AP regenerates and then finish off the low health ones with some VATS headshots. The key is focus fire. One enemies with 1 HP still does as much damage as an enemy with 100% HP, so finish them off one at a time while shooting, make use of cover if you're squishy or are taking too much damage, and liberally apply Molotov Cocktails.
---
I'm 255 lol üòÇ you? 
---
They put limits on some items like turrets and benches (which have a shared pool limit with others of the same category). This lets them expand the camp budget without having the more resource intensive items cause instability.
---
Nope I'd never trade that, plus I know I thought it from another player
---
The best part of dlc for this game people thinking the later updates magically will appear ealry cause they think its there 
---
None of the base recipes are non-alcoholic, but who knows what will be unlocked in the future.
---
I lost 300
---
I thought it was common knowledge that for the most part mods are/will be an issue in a game that updates regularly. 
---
:::shrug:::
---
I've been trying to build a new camp...I thought that may have had something to do with it until I saw a few other posts about this issue.
---
I can't do the campfire / rug thingy to plant vegetables anymore... is it just me or they fixed it?
---
Was this always there?
---
I was getting 1 outside and 2-3 inside every time I visited until the last patch, now I rarely ever see one. 
---
Mine has never shown a quest marker for that specific questline to "follow her journey" until I discover the area the next holotape is at. Each holotape gives a verbal hint during it that does not get updated into the quest log. I think it's intentional so you have to pay attention. Because a lot of the chests give you plans that otherwise would cost a couple thousand caps or hours of grinding.
---
Haven't had much of a chance to play. Got my brewery quest done and that's it. 
---
I'm still worried about the ash pile bug where loot doesn't drop if you kill enemies from a distance, but the damage increase on semi-auto energy to compensate for not tank killer and huge durability increase should make the guns usable.
---
Has anyone tried the beam splitter since thr patch? Are guns still dying in one magazine? 
---
About a month ago, I think Valentine's Day, Bethesda swept through and removed all duped items. I was thinking if you got it from another player, and that player duped it, you lose it even though you got it from legitimate means
---
New camera system is coming. Hopefully that brings a better storage system with it.
---
I see it as abuse because I killed him five times and go no caps for it. There
---
is no incentive for me to PvP him while he keeps seeking revenge so I logged off.
---
Simply owning a workshop does not put you in PvP. If a group begins to contest your workshop or anyone elses workshop in your group you all become flagged for PvP. 
---
welp even crafted brand new combat arms just to make sure. Yep, my ability to craft BoS Combat Arms is gone. I just submitted a ticket so I guess I just need to farm plastic and leather and rubber and go back to crafting and scrapping until I unlock it again or hear from them.
---
Put me somewhere next to Harper's Ferry but gave me the "long loading screen" so I was already killed by enemies before even loading in and had to change servers....spawned at my camp...
---
This!!!!!!! 
---
2/5 4/5 noooooooo!!
---
Once you finish the quest you can make them.
---
If you haven't yet I got you on the jetpack
---
If you really want to know then I'm more than happy to tell you why I was suspended and why I do look forward to getting back on Fallout 76, whenever that may be. 
---
I've been playing since the very first beta on xbox, and would usually play everyday to grind some atoms or to simply explore the wasteland. However, by the beginning of 2019 I have played enough to reach level 100 and have killed the SBQ too many times to count. While my enjoyment of adventuring has dwindled over time I found a new enjoyment in trading. I would spend hours on the trading subreddits here and on the xbox marketplace. 
---
With my new found interest in trading I saw an opportunity to earn some caps. I would look for post that were selling Tse weapons/Nuka quantums/Ultracite ammo and anything else people were selling for dirt cheap then selling it to someone else for triple. 
---
The opportunity was there to make an easy cap without getting my hands too dirty, so I took it and made a living trading weapons for almost a month and a half. I'm not going to lie, I definitely profited from others using an exploit so when I was suspended I was half surprised half not.
---
I mostly want to come back because my girlfriend still enjoys to play, and to be honest the road map looks really neat. Especially the new raid. Whenever I do get unsuspended I will probably continue trading because I truly find it fun now, but seeing how associating with dupers resulted in my being suspended I may be more cautious in the future with most of my trades. 
---
I run bloodied/adrenal and lost about 300 on my be Gauss, 400 on my be dragon and about 200 on my be lever.
---
He is pretty farmable, I've seen him 6-7 times tonight already.
---
You *do* have to look for him, but he's not that rare id you do.
---
It was mostly MAP data. the map is a highly optimized collection of MESHs to improve streaming IO for loading.
---
Were is it at?
---
Looks like I need a Youtube Account to actually watch it. Not sure why it was flagged for 18+.
---
Awesome thanks.
---
I was just commenting that they seem to have completely disappeared from the lore after New Vegas.
---
Can't they just get added to a "keychain" master item that can be inspected to see the keys on it? I swear there have been mods for that back to Morrowind.
---
Explaining anything to this person 
---
is akin to pounding your nuts flat
---
with a rusty hammer -while it's 
---
something you can do, it probably isn't
---
something you NEED to do.
---
Ooga booga op man mad
---
do not kill it too quickly........
---
I don't think the Overseer mission ever ends. I'm sure it'll be continued next time they release main story content. 
---
The organic solutions quest that you need to do is also bugged. Good luck. Been stuck on this since week 2.
---
If you don't find anything at RobCo you should check the high school.
---
True but it‚Äôs much easier it you have someone the stand there with him while you respawn to get what you want.
---
I was hoping gatling lasers would jump in damage more than what they did.  Have to try them out tonight.  I have three gatling lasers and 100 fusion cores to see if it's worth keeping them. I beleive my .50 cal jumped up noticeably (40+ damage now).
---
Those are what I thought he said he had numbers for. I thought I had missed them lol.
---
nut surprised
---
one by the Modus vendor terminals and one in the armory. maybe more not sure
---
You mean vats crits right? 
---
Any idea how long we have to wait til we can trigger the daily from booze bot? And any idea how to get that drink needed for killing ants for the daily ? 
---
Could someone link a pic of it? It sounds cool but I don't know what it looks or sounds like.
---
Someone just dropped a nuke. They were level 244
---
Agreed. It used to be complimentary to the tone and atmosphere. Now it‚Äôs the whole game. Disappointing IMO. 
---
Thanks man!
---
Been waiting for this since they were removed after the beta
---
Exactly. This is not a game issue. This is a trying to use last patches mod setup in the new patch issue.
---
Many thanks
---
Morgantown
---
I think you already can, at least i do
---
Well drill is still considered part of the legendary drop pool
---
The fissures?
---
I also noticed they instantly blow up now which is weird. If they blow up.. its still random whether they do or not
---
Yeah, Aqua boy seems too situational, I think I will use it like pick lock or hacker, swapping it when needed.  A cool END single point perk seems to be Good Doggy
---
I died while placing my power armor and the place/cancel option had the respawn option written over it so I couldn't choose any of them and had to close the app (and lose all my junk) in order to go on. Also a terrible time to die. 
---
Hopefully it is and not as intended. 
---
Is gamepad turned on in settings? 
---
Sure, for one attempt at his rare stuff.  And not everyone wants to relog over and over.
---
I was just surprised how often he shows up if you take the time to look.  Though, he still hasn't spawned with my hunter's coat :P
---
I was thinking about a single point of traveling pharmacy also.. 
---
Which mutation do you think I need?
---
Any help would be great
---
Right? We can wield a sledgehammer with one arm and swing it like it's a feather duster but we can't reach through a broken door and unlock it.
---
I woke up on a raft in the middle of a big lake in the Mire. Only things there were a teddy fear, chair, and moonshine jug.
---
depends if you use class freak or not. adrenal reaction, marsupial, eagle eyes, speed demon and carnivore are all very good to have. 
---
This makes me afraid to log in. My house on the ledge is probably broken now :(
---
I have a one-star furious and only broke it out of stash for queens. I‚Äôm excited to dust it off again!
---
It's very difficult to completely avoid damage with large mobs, especially an enclosed space like the Whitesprings clubhouse.  Not only do I find Whitesprings to be a great source of xp and loot, it's usually the best place to replenish scrap after relocating and rebuilding a large, hotel-style camp.  The ghouls drop everything from adhesive to wood, and there's literally tons of stuff to pick up along a circuit of the grounds.  
---
As a conventional armor character, I swap out Traveling Pharmacy 3 for Blocker 2 in STR and don't have too many problems dealing with a handful of ghouls that dialed in my number while I tried to sneak around.  The dense chest mod is a total game changer.  I used to kill myself shooting enemies at point blank with an explosive handmade rifle, but now it's 50% health at worst.
---
Today, with the fix to perma [danger], I've found that my stealth capabilities are back on par with what I was operating with in Fo4.  I don't just stay stuck in [danger] with nothing around me, and go back to [   caution    ] after I killed the enemies that were actually in my face and detecting me.
---
Far as I know there isn‚Äôt one. I tried to get a discussion going a little while back but it didn‚Äôt take off. I think it‚Äôd be useful to have 
---
Lmao
---
Really ? I can't. Just has basic fermented drinks craftable. You have to learn the recipes from a daily the bot gives. 
---
That would be why I would avoid the missile turret, that and with my luck I would forget I installed an explosive turret and go to address the issue myself and get killed by my own defenses.
---
My guess would be the Summit Betchel Reserve, just north of Beckley. Plenty of rumors circulate about it being another covert bunker in the mountains of West Virginia. As a West Virginian extremely close to it, I hear the theories quite a bit. Has also been the site of Boy Scout jamborees in the past. This is what makes the most sense to me, and as the person below me pointed out, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for it to be in the Forest, seeing as its low-level. The Ash Heap, which in my opinion is the least fleshed our area, is a prime target for something like this. Just a theory though, fellas.
---
they only removed duplicate items.  
---
So if op had 2 or more of the same item, the one equipped might have been deleted but should still have another one in inventory somewhere.
---
All hail Gadlantis! Huzzah!
---
Hey you still got him? Was gonna join on you rn 
---
Maybe people think they would update mods not made by them and never meant to be part of the game? I guess they could have just misjudged the impacts they could have when the actual developer made changes to the game itself.
---
I'm excited to play the game tomorrow, these updates look great and I'm looking forward to drinking Nukashine often. I'm looking forward to so much of this "Wild Appalachia" DLC!
---
324
---
I‚Äôd rather have a guaranteed spawn with a friend vs random while alone any day. I got the hunters coat by using a friend.
---
Does 8 fire 8 times for 1 nade?
---
Do you have to hold the button down for autofire? I know for my semi-auto rifle I just have to tap the crit button before my next trigger pull and it's a crit. 
---
Yes 
---
Ah, I must have misread. Thanks for clarifying! 
---
Dunno but you'll have to research them and weigh the pros and cons. If your not gonna use energy guns then grounded,  marsupial,  electricity charged,  idk what build your going for but i run 11 mutations with my vats sniper build
---
Gt?
---
Oh sweet! I have those all over my stage area.
---
Man, I love includinv the train station for the bonus cobalt flux in my Whitesprings nukes. Maybe they're trying to save you the heartache of nuclear destruction. 
---
I‚Äôm with ya. This was a minuscule issue sure,  but I‚Äôm glad they finally took care of it. 
---
Should say "fire rates INCREASED across the board".
---
I always pull the trigger as if i was trying to type 1,000 words per minute. 
---
In reality, my typing skills is horrible.
---
My brother tells me to stop before i break the controller.
---
Like with sword, instead of 1 hit per 30 seconds,  i want 10 hits per 2 seconds.  That way, we're actually hurting monsters before they kill us.
---
Maybe it's tied to my local time ?
---
It's way past 12am here
---
I completed the quest for High Voltage Hefe recipe and got rewarded with Rad Ant Lager which gives you +50 Carry Weight
---
I honestly never had the constant danger issue I hear people talking about. It always worked properly for me, except with scorched. They have xray vision, or the Interloper gives them clairvoyance. 
---
Is there ever going to be anything done with ammo? There is quite a bit of ammo I get that I don't use, and I would like to sell it to get rid of it but you can't do that so I figured maybe you could scrap it to make ammo you do need, but you cant do that either. so really the only options at the moment are to horde it, drop it or sell it to another player. I don't really like any of those options... I like playing as a lone wanderer since you get a cool feeling when you do come across somebody, but no one wants to trade and there are ammo types that I haven't had anybody want. Hording it is annoying because of the build that I am running, but dropping it is just a annoying in case I do need it at some point, or some change happens that make them useful. I could just not pick it up I suppose but sometimes it is unavoidable. So yeah anything being done about ammo?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ ok, I bow down to your greatness. Lol. I thought about starting over, just to get a lower # lol 
---
It was so streamers wouldn't get copy strikes, hence the new world radio's audio slider that came out today alongside them.
---
ATXlien just sent you a team invite 
---
But....screw having to get all my perk cards again. 
---
I can't seem to force-place foundations with the campfire.  Is anybody else having that issue?
---
Holy chap I didn't realize how much of your camp budget was taken up by turrets and lights. The camp budget is huge now, I love it. Is the only quest line that super short crafting one or are there more?
---
I‚Äôve also heard some people still aren‚Äôt getting their supposed guaranteed drop from some legendaries as well.
---
It means you got there shortly after a nuke zone expired and the ghouls were still respawning that way. It happens at white springs, too for a little bit after the zone goes away.
---
FUCKING NEED IT. I am gonna try triggering it. 
---
Only two floors? Need to up your game. :)
---
Sorry to hear :( 
---
Does the gauss rifle count as an energy weapon in the first place? I always thought of it as a ballistic weapon. Technically it would be, but it would also make sense that it is an energy weapon.
---
158 and first for the day 
---
She will be missed, bugs and all...but hello Wild Appalachia 
---
Platform? I'm XB1, I haven't launched in 3 days. Lvl 255. 
---
Had been there for weeks and hadn't seen one that hurt my camp. Several right to the left of the station.. just lucky I guess. 
---
All good, explosions never hurt me, I'll often train mobs to a car or two, only to hit the cars for fun and watch them burn, burn baby burn.
---
Uh oh, inb4 'you exploited our game by (we think purposefully) duping so we indefinitely banned your account until further notice.' /s
---
Then when you complain about it a mob of literally stupid husks for people will swarm you abusing and ridiculing you for being banned without any actual substantial proof of being a duper and will twist and manipulate everything you say and post to demonize you into a heartless lowlife piece of trash because you didn't do things a certain way.
---
(Sorry guy, you'll be fine, but many others innocently are screwed over with no action for recourse or restitution.)
---
Why did it take this long? It was in the BETA.
---
I haven‚Äôt come across it but they did say they were making certain areas of the map no camp zones about a week ago.
---
I'll be happy as soon as I can figure out how to hide them, turned on, in team members camps.  The longer it takes them to find it, the better.
---
That vault has super weird architecture going on. The lines in the stone match the inventions on the gear and go out into the exterior wall. I have to look at this myself when my iwatch finally downloads and installs:(
---
Read the patch notes, they‚Äôve included an explanation for this.
---
Can't help you there. I usually stream the A-Bomb Radio app while I'm playing. Hundreds of songs &gt; a few dozen. :)
---
Most likely scenario, you dropped it without realizing it.
---
Can‚Äôt wait!
---
u/srsly_dang  ....amazing 
---
Apparently these areas are gonna be new locations in the future 
---
Here come a new wave of screenshots of peoples new, bigger, crazier CAMPs. Good.
---
Mine too!
---
I bet this is the underground area from the trailer
---
I also cant figure out how to start
---
They pached it and the rug glitch
---
Honestly, this actually explains a lot... I wondered why the SBQ would be carrying a drill so often and not give me a legendary
---
Ah ok, thanks 
---
Straight outta Appalachia
---
I second that motion. I've appreciated every bit of help and guidance I've received and I do my best to share things that I learn as well.
---
The ammo is affected by "Batteries Included" and it's categorized under Energy Weapons when crafting. But who knows, really.
---
I milk every yogi bear I find for all it's worth.
---
I removed all mods early today. Ran scan/repair tool and still was falling. Had to get rid of the custom ini. It can be fixed from what I read on Nexus. But am at work so haven't had the chance to try it out.
---
I did and I was oddly confused. I have some mirelurks that spawn outside my house so I went and killed them like usual. One diseased mirelurk decided that healing sounded cool so he healed. I assumed it was lag. He dropped a Two-shot Plasma with reduced carry weight. Nothing amazing, but it was level 20 so it was great for a lower level friend of mine.
---
I think it's no longer a multiple of each other. I don't think it was ever intended to be a multiple of each other
---
Still a great find!
---
Please make the plastic cups in the frat house scrap so we can get some plastic. 
---
It will be a long time before that happens.
---
If you tell players that they can get the one-day only stuff later, they won't open their wallets and use real cash to get them before the deadline is up.
---
PS4 I‚Äôm going to launch another one later so I‚Äôll see if it will let me 
---
The Sheepsquatch Poster, Alpine Horn, and Travel Pip-Boy are all definite purchases for me.
---
Maybe the Prepper Trapper outfit too, but I want to see some more pictures of the 2nd variation first.
---
I got them during the Uramium Fever event but not as an event reward. They were in the back of a room above the pond, on the left as you enter.
---
I've done this event lots of times but this was the first time I found plans. I usually go to this area to collect a power core from a room nearby.
---
^ Yup. I do this all the time. 
---
IF  killed too quickly:
---
       Return    drill
---
Well it saved the update progress so u won't have to do that again
---
You put in the time and effort to also get what he had? 
---
No, no nvm that would be insane, just limit the people who already put in the work
---
Yes that would be more reasonable 
---
Awesome!
---
They said a 10% to semi autos buff in the patch notes...
---
10% of 40 is 4.
---
10% of 20 is 2.
---
WTF were you expecting???
---
Have you tried uninstalling it and playing something else 
---
Sadly no. :( 
---
Maybe someone else will come along and check?
---
Well it did. Each barrage has about 5 shots, and multiply that because 8 artillery. Like 5 minutes of non-stop boom.
---
Bold of you to assume I made only 3 drinks
---
No you will NOT destroy.
---
DROP is always available!!!!
---
What if I'm trying to decide what to drop/keep and i accidentally destroy something?
---
BAD MISTAKE!!
---
Plus, what if i want to drop things for other players?
---
I never throw things away. 
---
I travel Appalachia pressing Y on xbox one to trade with others
---
My carry weight is almost always 1200/305.
---
If i want to pick up EVERYTHING under the Sun then CRAWL like a snail, for nearly 30 minutes back to either my camp, or Whitesprings artisan corner,
---
Then I'll crawl.  
---
Scrapping armor and weapons unlocks mods.
---
But if i don't, i rather use COME HERE emote, drop a huge bag of unwanted stuff in front of players then run off.
---
They did exactly what they said. These numbers reflect the 10% buff they outlined...
---
I've never had a controller attached to this system. This was it, not that I could even get to the settings without one. Thanks. That was weird?
---
If you go to WesTek Research and you are not killing the super mutants in 1-shot,  your build is not optimized. That will result in more ammo needed. I have 3 characters, transferring the ammo acquired through killing enemies is usually sufficient for me. I don't need to craft shell most of the time unless I went for SBQ. 
---
Sadly I didn‚Äôt try the ini thing before reinstalling... 
---
Foundations: Addressed an issue that could allow players to stack Foundations under certain circumstances.
---
NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Thanks. I have this didn't know if I could just copy and paste. Also gave better maps too
---
I put in the time and effort; however I shouldn't have to wait on RNG to get the exact same OP things he has.
---
I'm fairly certain that's inaccurate. While sneaking, if undetected you do a base 2x damage without perks, but do standard damage when it says [DANGER]. That does not mean you are doing half damage. That means you are not getting your 2x multiplier. The target has to have not detected you for you to get your sneak multiplier.
---
Fair enough. I have never really used one seriously as well, so the more you know! :)
---
Unfortunately it's part and parcel of being a multiplayer game with microtransactions these days. Gotta push the wacky costumes. Just look at Rainbow Six Siege. The funny thing is FO76 has the bleakest setting of all the Fallouts since everyone is dead.
---
regarding the amount of items you CAN drop thats like saying "He won the lottery? how about you stop complaining and win the lottery yourself?!". 
---
Of course i do see your point and its valid, its just not exactly that easy.
---
Says someone who HAS put in all the work and HAS all the gear you can have as result. I did it, and i hated it. It was not fun at all. It was a job getting all this.
---
These changes are super exciting because messing with my C.A.M.P. is easily my favorite thing to do on this game!
---
They did exactly what they said they would do? Why so salty?
---
screenshot?
---
Plasma needs to do at least 40+40 (80) base.  It uses a rare ammo type, and the projectile needs time to travel. Heck, 50+50 might even be the sweet spot.
---
And the armor piercing thing needs to be addressed.  Without any access to armor piercing modifications, these weapons will suffer fighting robots, which is ironic, as the double damage of plasma is supposed to help mitigate defense.
---
Either give energy weapons inherent armor piercing capabilities, like 30% armor piercing regardless what the modifications are, or give the receivers the additional ability to pierce armor depending on which one.
---
And if you don't do that, then lower the energy defense of all enemies by at least 40%.  Gutsy robots that have near-equal ballistic and energy defense invalidate energy weapons almost completely if they have no way to pierce armor, so drop that 100 energy defense to like 60, and the same with any other enemy that has currently equal-parts ballistic and energy defense.
---
Oh man, that donut pipboy... that's pretty sick. These are great items. Masks, posters, I'm impressed.
---
Still would never buy atoms lol, but better put Apex down and start grinding those daily's and weekly's again.
---
LOL. Don't you need to put on your PA or hazmat in case you get sent into a nuke zone?
---
Many, many, many moons ago I read a great article about designing game processes. The example process was calculating the effects of a hit against a tank. The author described all of the detail that went into the calculations; projectile type, weather, angle of impact, armor composition and thickness, and on and on. They then described how the elements affected the calculations. The interaction model so to speak.
---
At the end of the article the author revealed that this detail is pointless. This is for a game, not a military simulation. The programmers designed this game so that the computer has all the fun. The player only knows there's a big boom in the general direction they fired.
---
While not in the same ballpark, Fallout (not even specifically 76) is in the same direction. 
---
Like I said...how are they this bad at such a simple fucking task?
---
lesser company like valve, who gave up on Artifact
---
Most shotguns don't 1 shot anything level 50+ unless it has an insane roll like 2 shot explosive.
---
Thank you 
---
Personally dont know. Could've, but I just found it today. 
---
It would make sense that it is new, since all the other vaults have interior rooms and this one does not(maybe meaning its still under development)
---
So any changes for pistols coming anytime soon? Specifically automatic ones? And why don't the changes to energy weapons apply to automatic energy weapons?
---
Just don't like small factor automatic guns?
---
I'm sure it'll only spawn around the outskirts of the map. I'd be pissed if I had to constantly worry about getting jumped by high level beasts when I just started.
---
I'm thinking the patch might have toggled something. I usually play with a controller on my PC unless I'm playing something competitive and I noticed I couldn't use the keyboard when my controller was toggled on, so I took a guess that might have been the issue. 
---
You could probably toggle in the .ini file as well,  if worse came to worst. 
---
Would love to see them change the pipboys light to match the paint! (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me that finds it irritating...) 
---
Or just have separate mods like with the power armor headlamps.
---
Is the power armor step through still working?
---
You remain invisible to all other players constantly.
---
How to recreate: Spam crouch/sneak key when a piece of chameleon armor is equipped.
---
That'll teach you to forget to feed it, obviously it got hungry and ate your station
---
or even better... Mutantz wit Attitudes
---
Some people, like myself, use custom ini files to tweak their graphics settings and have never used mods. 
---
Ahhh, okay. 
---
Day one was pretty wild, everyone coming in with wild expectations and no idea how all the game mechanics worked just kind of aimlessly shooting or punching any nearby person, creature, or object, trying to figure out perks and bobbleheads and magazines and VATS unlike all previous Fallout stuff. And do we spend the entire game just chasing holotapes? Wut....
---
Bumpy ride no lie, but if I could time travel to a few months back, I would tell my younger self ‚ÄúPatience, man. It definitely gets better!‚Äù
---
Also I would give younger me todays lottery numbers because damn why waste time travel, you know?
---
Not to my knowledge. Ive never had good results with it anyways though.
---
This. They fixed over 30 bugs and exploits, rolled out new content m, and tweaked energy weapons exactly like they said they would, while ALSO FIXING THE SAME WEAPONS so that they finally get 2* and 3* legendary effects. The whole point of "balancing" is to keep something from becoming or staying overpowered. Don't whine and botch because what they changed didn't suddenly make energy weapons the top tier gun. Now they are on par with other similar weapons, and can get the same legendary modifiers. 
---
Soo... where is this camp that is blocked?  Just curious to see where new content will show up!
---
shit
---
And your username reeks of elitist garbage so what's your point?
---
I've been holding off on showing mine specifically for this update. New thread coming soon!
---
At least they'd be in range to defend at that point. 
---
&gt; A 10% buff is ~~a ~~shit ~~ton~~.
---
ftfy
---
Just remember to not be overencumbered and to have  caps on you before you Nukashine.
---
Have some, can make most. What are you looking for?
---
In fallout 4 I had a full rebuild above hangman alley that was complete with numerous glass skyscrapers.

Once mods came out on PS4, settlement building was like a game within a game.

Read one of the party posters around the map and in train stations. You can also get one for free in the CAMP section of the atomic shop and place one in your camp and read that. Then just follow then quest.
---
We need a lot of razor with this update...
---
By the crafting stations and vendor terminal.
---
*TRY* IT!
---
The biggest things is the condition will decrease MUCH more slowly, so you can actually spray and pray more liberally without the dammed thing breaking after every creature. Or twice in one creature for the spongier ones.

My heart genuinely aches reading these comments...and seeing these words. Maybe more than it should. Honestly...? I'm almost in tears. Why do I want to play the game I fell in love with and paid for?...Why...why wouldn't I? Let me fill you in on something. I don't need you guys to believe me. But yeah. It gets to me. And yeah, it fucking hurts. It makes me feel little. Regardless of what you believe and the stubborn minds I cannot change, I never have duped. But I did attain mass items through trade on the market reddit in exchange for a few really nice legendary weapons/ that I actually didn't care about. The guy was adamant on getting them from me, and I didn't have max caps, but around 18,000. I didn't think 7,000 caps would suffice for what he was asking for. In exchange he offered mass items as a means of pay and I did accepted. He switched characters five times, dropping 25,000 of two sets of items. Super stimpaks, and bird bones. I didn't need either that bad...but it felt fair. Now before anything else, I have mild autism (aspergers) and I was naive...too naive. I felt it was weird. But I didn't do anything to stop this and kind of just accepted it. I don't really have the mental tools in social situations that let me stand up for myself or confront others with suspicions. But what's worse and makes me feel even more mentally retarted? I didn't really suspect much. The day I got suspended I cried so damn much. I'm a 23 year old girl who felt 3 again. I felt powerless. This game calmed my unorthodox anxieties. It felt like home. And when I was frustrated with the world around me. It let me escape. It It gave me an outlet to feel connected to people. That...was big...for me.
---
Now the stab in the heart came when that person who gave me all the items was still online. Still is. They never got suspended. I reached out to them to ask if they had duplicated and how they're still playing. I'll never forget their response because it stirred up an awful anger and sense of hopelessness in myself. 
---
"Yeah I nvr stacked items and havent in a while so I guess I'm fine lololol"
---
I reached out to bethesda, pleaded with them before this message took place. I wanted to know what was going to happen from this and how long. I love this company but they've made me so frustrated with the handling of this that I've considered going back to therapy. There's something about not knowing that really screws me up mentally...and what's more. In several ticket attempts, I had outted this guy for his practices, dropped his name, and even attached a file with the admittance to a ticket...but the damage was done. The tickets only got closed as duplicates with no response after the initial ticket, which was before these messages took place. I truly felt broken. I calmed down after a week and talking to my mom. She helps. She tried to call herself which only served to make me feel even more small, just to find out they don't take calls. I just wanted a response. A human interaction. And usually those can sometimes scare me. I admit I was naive in this mistake and the fault is my own for being literally too dense to truly understand what was happening. I can only apologize for not having keen awareness. But I've learned my lesson. I feel it's crumbled a little piece of me that tries to trust other people and all all the steps I've made to communicate and understand others. I felt so shunned. This community I fell in love and reading comments like this definitely fragmented a part of trust i have with the community. And as for bethesda, I grow frustrated, but mainly due to the support handling on this. I just don't want to be kept in in the dark. This whole process broke me a bit.
---
It might just be a game to others, but it was a mental tie to all the progress I've been making for me.
---
So that's why I want to be back.
---
Because I want to experience that camaraderie again.
---
Message sent with my character/platform details. 
---
Here's a screen capture of the issue:

[194 hours remaining](https://i.imgur.com/1m8YqcY.png)

It did this to a camp I built AFTER the patch.
---
Not online, but can be shortly 
---
I am so ridiculously excited about the fasnacht mask parade, I've got every unique cosmetic and then stopped playing. I will be HOONING on that mission.
---
Ahhh thank you kind sir
---
marsupial
---
Don't get anywhere near my nuts!
---
Got this after my first move post patch.

Twice

Crouch infront of the fermenting and youll see flash or shake press X small explosion and its done
---
I cant get it to work anymore. I wish it wasnt fixed though. I loved exploring places 
---
One of my personal favorites is the girl with gardenias in her hair
---
Can do or have it
---
They intentionally used the word rebalance. OP is salty because they didn't buff them to the point of being ridiculously overpowered. He probably stacked up a bunch of then thinking he was going to be nigh untouchable and now he's disappointed because instead of being overpowered they are realistically functional.
---
I can't even place the little one. 
---
Nice. I always like to see all the cool builds.
---
If it was my yao gui I wouldn't care, but my once fierce protector is now a docile camp eating monster that I can't get rid of.
---
This is great stuff. I knew Psychopath was weak sauce, but I‚Äôm very interested to know that you only need the one perk. It makes for a more consistent crit rhythm as well, four lead clover often messes up my timing when VATsing stuff.
---
OMG, happens to me at least twice a day during a 4 hour sesh.
---
1 star bloodied with the right perks is enough. Of course, you need to get close. Guess you ain't playing sneak silenced shotgunner build.
---
Its an atom shop item.
---
might have been removed in the "spring cleaning" if it is not there anymore.
---
It is three hours for it to become vintage, but it will be faster if you put it in a fermenter. During the mission, there is a small note on the machinery near the Brewing Station which will allow you to use the fermenter that is located there once you read it to instantly ferment it instead of waiting three hours.
---
I'm not going to play it as long as there are legendary weapons and armor, and since those are foundational to Fallout 76 (they are the entire point of the game) they aren't going anywhere.
---
Not a big deal, there are other things in 76 to look forward to and plenty of other games with balanced PvP
---
I've had a 2 shot gatling plasma for ever now. Long before the dupers. I haven't seen if it's good or not though 
---
How much budget space does your brahmin take up? 
---
weird some how must have missed it thks
---
What hood is in the picture?
---
In addition to this, more roofs than just the tin/old wood roofing. Let's see slats, or tiles, or something. 
---
Totally agree. Not regrinding the game. 
---
i got stuck in infitie loading screens im restarting now
---
They have fixed so much stuff I wanted
---
Can't you just hit and run like before? Kill them, run in take the legendary and run away before it explodes?
---
I've not seen anything in the past 4 months to give me confidence Bethesda is capable of balancing legendary effects.
---
Whoa, you're enjoying this? Me too! Seriously though, this game was buggy, still slightly is, but the hate is unwarranted. People are entitled jerks and get mad easily. Keep enjoying the game!
---
okey dokey
---
I still enjoy it. There WERE a lot of bugs, many of which have been fixed. But most people that like the game for what it is really didn't have an issue with it until getting further into the game.
---
The issue for them seemed to be reoccurring bugs that just didn't get fixed. I have never had any major issues and love the game as it is.
---
This floor tile was only available for a short time, it was a limited release atom shop item. Unfortunately I missed it as well.
---
I have no damage increase for my semi auto tesla or plasma rifle. It seems like the patch may not be quite right. üòî
---
You filled out a form incorrectly, you must return to Charlston DMV to correct the form .....

Bloodied, anti armor, instigating and furious are what people are using mostly now 
---
I wanted it to bring me into the Skyrim intro after the blackout.
---
Oh, so Reddit is nothing but a bunch of apologists willing to make excuses for them. I guess that explains why they only reply to Reddit threads and completely ignore their own forums and support tickets. 
---
when you start the game of you switch to trevor he can be in a ton of random places my favorite is hes in sandy shores in an empty pool with a crashed helicopter behind him
---
If you were on XB1 I‚Äôd sell you some legitimate gear but I‚Äôm sure there are others in PS4 who have grinded hard like me who would be happy to share the love. I think this is a discussion worth having I just fundamentally disagree with wiping characters.
---
Yeah, it should be a reward from completeing the quest. Did you get all the way to the end? There are several parts to it.
---
Good I like milk and was hopping it would be in the game
---
So you're saying we should forgive an obvious bug because it provides a workaround for another bug? Why not just fix both?   
---
I know; it's the "fix" part, isn't it?
---
Same issue here. Can't use my sniper scope at all. 
---
DNS would not change the size of a download.  File sizes are static.  It would however change your speed depending on which server DNS translated.

You have a point about not all energy weapons getting the buff. What your missing about the ones that did are the min maxers. They have to factor in bloodied builds, crit builds and how they stack with legendarys. Look at some of the other posts where people are posting pics already of high rate of fire weapons doing 150 to 300 dmg. Heavy and heavy energy weapons just became the new meta.
---
If you don't know how mods work you shouldn't use them
---
Wild Appalachia's theme seems to be about enjoying the sights and sounds of West Virginia, and since this is a multiplayer game, I get the feeling they'll be banking more on the player interaction aspect.  The tone kind of makes sense.  
---
I'm assuming whatever comes after Wild Appalachia might have a more serious tone.
---
Now energy weapons can correctly get 2* and 3* legendary modifiers as well. Handmade aren't OP until you get a TSE and bloodied or unyielding or armor piercing or whatever. Standard versions of most weapons except melee are manageable. The legendary status is what makes your weapon destructive. People need to stop getting upset when a rebalancing doesn't make the weapons in question insanely OP. Most of them probably stockpiled the weapons thinking they would have a one up on everyone for a little while, and are now butthurt because the guns are now just on par instead of OP. 
---
A screenshot of it or of a marker on the map would help. I'm curious but I know those mountains and searching would be time consuming D:

WHEN ARE WE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD???
---
An unmarked shack by black water mine
---
There was an update today that fixed some things and broke some.
---
Indeed it does. What they hey though, let's let them double dip because we need a brokenly powerful weapon class in the game.
---
Online now if you want to join me
---
Woah! Great find! Thanks for sharing! Can't wait to see if we'll get to enter all the other vaults.
---
Grafton dam the first time.  The second time I was showing my brother the effect in Haprers Ferry and wound up somewhere in the top left corner of the map.  
---
I don‚Äôt think limited usefulness of long range weapons at short range is a bug.
---
In a billboard in the Ash Heap.
---
damn they are getting serious I think they actually want to save the game rather then letting it die 
---
did another complete rebuild of my camp, took an hour, log out, log back in got same message. done doing QA on this one. makes the game unplayable for me. 
---
Glad I'm not the only one, and its not just the scopes but all sights. I tested my pistol, shotgun, everything and no dice. Lmao how did they even manage to cause an issue like this?
---
Hunter's Hood, unfairly removed because it was a dev room item, a few people still have one
---
hell yeah
---
Dammit, Todd! 
---
I've on more than one occasion dropped a complete modded set of leather or wood Armour outside Vault 76 when going past along with some stims, radx, radaway, food, purified water, some plans and a couple of weapons, ammo and grenades.  Depends on what I have at the time.
---
Someone did it for me. A Level 2xx chap in power armour dropped a few low level legendary pipe rifles and other stuff, I've been doing it since I hit level 50.
---
I regularly have a stack of duplicate plans and also a load of junk I don't need.  I'll drop them at Flatwoods normally.
---
I always check Nexus for fixes before doing anything. Learned the hard way. The mod authors hear about problems before we have them. The better ones get right on it.
---
What about the second time?
---
Same on xb1
---
FO76 has done alot to earn its bad press..  The game was released an unfinished buggy mess coupled with a few really bad product sales along side it.  It hasnt stopped me from enjoying the game in the past and being anxious to try new updates, but we dont have to pretend the hate isnt justified at all.
---
Yes! And all these weekly photo challenges are annoying me because I have to keep deciding what photos I like the least to clear space for photos I'm not planning on keeping in my album.

Monorail car out in the Mire near Abandoned Big town lol

It's now dropping slightly behind us 
---
I have no reason to lie. The file size did changed. I don't know the cause. I just say what I did.
---
OMG, I saw that and thought: "hey, the first item I would legit pay money for!"
---
 It's sweet, and I love the Nuka Cola stuff.

I can't do the campfire / rug trick anymore, is it just me or they fixed that one too?

Watchtower overlooking Grafton
---
Nope, that's pay to win...we don't want that 
---
Bugs and balance issues aside, this game isn't going ri cater to every type of player.  Some of them simply don't like multiplayer fallout.  Some really hate the lack of human npcs.  Some think it should be Fornite with a Fallout skin.  There are lots of reasons.  Just focus on why you like it instead of worrying about the rest and you'll have a better time ;)
---
R/fallout76settlements
---
As a note it could be worth screen capturing the location it was at and some surroundings people on here are pretty good at figuring out what might go there and I'm sure someone will appreciate the information :)
---
Okay on way
---
I know your pain, I never used any FO76 mods either and every time this happens people call me a liar. Like, why would I lie about it? It's broken, it's not my fault lol. 
---
That was the method for stacking foundations so yes, that's exactly what was patched.
---
With your flippy floppies?
---
Super Mutants sound stupid, but lore wise they are actually supposed to literally be "suoer" in every aspect, even mentally. Look at the Hulk. He's big and green and talks funny, but he's still an acclaimed biophysics scientist. 
---
I see your frustration though.
---
What if I told you that while they share the hive mind, the concept of a hive mind denotes a central control unit of some kind. Even the SBQ answers to something, because there are several. I personally think that the Interloper in Lucky Hole Mine will eventually be the "Mind" behind the "Hive". The story in the Mothman town hints that they were warned about impending events such as scorchbeast attacks and the flood and the sake thing in Helvetia. We are only seeing the beginning of the Scorched story line. I think there is much more to come.
---
Unmarked location in the Mire next to a Glowing Deathclaw... I survived 
---
The Sunday Brothers' Cabin also added a brewing station
---
Ah that makes sense, first time I‚Äôve seen it. 
---
I truly wish you the best, how people are treating each other over this truly is saddening. We can only hope that Bethesda offers some kind of olive branch for those suspended/banned and decides to ignore all the vitrol that has blanketed everyone affected. Good Luck out there in whichever wasteland you end up next, be it more 76 or another.
---
Wait...do you think bullets....teleport? Like, they just appear after a certain range, not that they, you know, shoot out of the gun and thereby should by right hit whatever is in front of the gun even if it is right in front of the gun?   
---
Seriously unless your long-barrel is clipping through the enemy and poking out the back side of his hit box it should still hit him, and if it's not then that is a bug. 
---
Kinda surprised there aren't more posts about it, hopefully it's not just us and they'll fix it. 
---
I have noticed this lately. Reloading or bashing usually gets me unstuck and able to aim down the sights freely, again.
---
 Its frustrating when it happens in 3rd person, as your character's aim goes to complete shit when its stuck.
---
You can place your camp there. Also, the spotlight pointing up with the combinations of the power bike is interesting lets just say :P
---
I had one Legendary Glowing Ghoul with no Legendary item.
---
I was unable to either. And I couldn't plant things in the cracks between foundations anymore. 
---
From what I‚Äôve read from others, mods are causing the issue. Unfortunately I‚Äôm console. But if you read through some of the comments, they have talked about possible fixes. 
---
I didn't see the 50 cal receivers at watoga BOS  vendor.  Are people really finding them there?
---
Stop trying to speak for everyone.

Thanks guys,  keep up the good work!
---
It‚Äôs only worth what‚Äôs someone will pay... Hold out and try to sell it to someone or hold it for the vendor! Can‚Äôt remember if a 3* gets you a 3* with vendor or just a chance... I‚Äôd keep it and turn it in, caps are easy to find and sell for 
---
Shhhhh! Don't let them know.
---
Yeah its basically unplayable for me right now 
---
My level 4 character is packed with legendary items and plans to sell. It's basically my solution to not yet having player vending. He is my vending machine!

Hopefully player vending will mean I can stop all that nonsense and be putting it in a vendor instead.

I shot up someone's CAMP for shits and giggles and now my bounty is over 400 caps, come at me bro
---
Heh, back to dense armor for now, I guess

If you used floors as roof to your concrete base you can still have immune base until you move it
---
I believe that error refers to items that are/were placed in your camp using the mat trick- or plants placed on firepits or mats so they could be grown indoors. Those tricks were patched.
---
50% more damage and 66% rate of fire reduction is a lot better.
---
Armor reduces damage based on the ratio of damage to armor, so increasing damage 50% reduces armor by 50% effectively. Given everything has a ton of armor that is actually effectively doubling the damage output, which makes the rate of fire trade off totally worth it.
---
Neat!
---
A spot sort of overlooking the Lakeside Cabins to the east.
---
I have a feeling I was forced to move my CAMP because I had it next to a scene that I could totally imagine being a destination for this.
---
No thats 3 floors now. I have a basement :)
---
I thought Radaway lowered you disease resistance not increased it?
---
The weird thing is that my rooftop garden is still intact (to the rug / campfire)... now im afraid to modify or move them just in case I mess them up &gt;\_&lt;
---
\*sigh\* I was planning to create another rooftop garden for my alts because some of my friends planning to buy fallout 76 and play with me from lv 1. 
---
RIP rooftop garden... lol
---
And here i was expecting a story about a troop of leather jacket wearing hooligans offering chems for sale. 
---
Yeah im tired of mmos period. Never really liked or played them. Always to easy to and to many cheaters. Just give me fallout 5. This was a total joke and co.plete waste of time and so far have nothing good to say about it. Since all u can get now is mmo s and if u order a year early u get a great light u can use in line and if u pay 50 extra ull get most the stuff u need to play some of the game. If u buy stock in our company u will get msybe two mire things that are actually useless to the game. Wish i could play gutair at this point and forget gaming completely. And ive played every game or system i could since before pong came out! And this has nearly broke me. A die hard fallout fan.
---
hi there, i have kind of the same problem as OP.
---
i play with some friends on a daily basis and our camps are pretty close to each other, and it appears that when im login to the server before my friend does both camps get placed, but when im joining my friend my camp will not be placed. 
---
around 45 min ago we tried to launch a nuke but none of our characters was able to, because we had like 250 hours cooldown(doesnt seems to be intented but that not the point right now), so i tried to switch characters to launch with this one. i also wasnt able to launch on that character. i closed the game and switched back to my previous character to rejoin my friend but since then im not able to join any server with that character. i can join servers with my other characters. if you need additional information, i can send you a dm
---
sounds like a design flaw to me
---
I just checked. I was having the same problem. Booted up my ‚Äútools‚Äù it was being routed the wrong file for dlc. 
---
Have you maxed out your number of lights? New max lights is 50
---
Well, hopefully you can.  I got this a bit late.
---
I just saw someone with a marine helmet on. No idea where they got it from.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Unmarked location just north of Camp McClintock.
---
My character has had the Gridiron make-up from day one, so it goes with her character.
---
Ah, nice! I've been wanting to do something like that but it's hard to find a good spot with a pond/lake and acid deposit like I have. 
---
Haha the hard part is getting the damn schematics
---
Yes please, it always feels like day. With the exception being the heavy forest area.
---
Even the ones that you build with the fertilizer at your camp? 
---
Bloodied &amp; AAE are the new duped items
---
Haha...It wasn't intended to be.  Maybe a little snarky.   I have no problem with Fortnite, really, it's just not my style of game :)
---
This also happened to me last patch as well... 50+gb download. I'm not home currently to check what the status of the current patch/download is.
---
Good luck mate. 
---
I agree although I‚Äôve had problems with lower levels trying to grief me lately in return. 
---
You realize you can play rifleman without being a sniper, right? That is actually the main reason I am upset about this shotgun BUG. If you play rifleman you can have a .308 sniper, and a semi-auto .45 combat rifle (or lever action rifle) that work as either snipers or mid range weapons. That is sort of what the level action is there for; higher rate of fire lets you clear rooms with it.   
---
By contrast shotgunners have ONE ammo type. We're supposed to be able to mod energy weapons for use as backups, because literally every other gun type in the game has multiple options with multiple ammo types letting you specialize in that type of weapon, but still have situational options. Shotguns have....20 gauge shells. And that's it. We CAN'T specialize, we have to have a secondary weapon focus with another perk line.   
---
Apparently you CHOOSE to specialize, I CAN'T. Because the guns are bugged. You could stop being obtuse and slap a short barrel on a lever action and be fine. You just choose not to. I functionally can't have a backup gun that uses the same perks, but different ammo, as my main one. 
---
üòÇ üçª
---
Damn, bravo Bethesda!  I may just start a new player so I can experience it all in the proper order.  I'm so glad they're working so hard on this game.  The last update looks fantastic and the only wish I still have is a buff to ammo crafting and semi-auto rifle damage and another increase to camp storage.  
---
Escort missions are cancer. I logged in tonight for the first time since about 2 or 3 weeks after launch. The combat on this game is still terrible. The pop up spawns and clumsy interface make this feel like something a 13 year old dreamed up in his basement. Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this. It is a truly embarrassing excuse for a game. 
---
But I do want those masks. And the soundtrack is still great. 
---
I found one after finishing the quest!! Had to server hop, but only had to do it three times! Next, I search for the cap
---
Make heavy weapons great again! 
---
Yeah, to be fair, the error message is vague.  I could imagine that my CAMP was near one of the possible Nukashine destinations, because it was parked next to a weird scene with skeletons, but it could also be interpreted as "There's something illegal about your CAMP and you need to rebuild it."  It's worth noting that even though it was a one-foundation CAMP, I wasn't able to place it at the new location.  So, I'm not sure if it violated something or not.
---
I don‚Äôt care for the BR mode but yeah I was wondering if that was an actual opinion
---
They fixed the keypad power switch, maybe they broke doors? All I know is the keypad controlling my garage door only works with the code now, the switch on the pole isn‚Äôt interactable. 
---
Did you have walls made of lights and turrets? I have a big house with all sorts of stupid non fuctional forniturs and only got like 10% back.
---
At least i can now light the whole place up.
---
even after disabling all mods, all issues remain unfortunately, I was only using perk loadout manager and a UHD map mod.
---
might want to say what platform?
---
All mods disabled and this shit still happens.
---
Hell yea finally a heavy weapon balance
---
They're trying emphasises to social aspect of the game.
---
*Laughs in fireproof, dense ,and adamantium*

I would add a screenshot, but it says that isn‚Äôt allowed here

&gt;I found him up in the mire
---
Near the dam? I just found him there too. 
---
Y'know, I don't know if it was just me, but when I went and placed some of the twinkling lights at my CAMP today, they were producing that Nuka-Cola logo in the light.
---
Oh sorry, it‚Äôs game cast. 
---
What platform? PC has it because people stole it from the dev room on there
---
Luke Skywalker?
---
YUP
---
Colorado?
---
YUP!
---
Good Job Beth. Only one thing that I want now, which is 1000 spaces of inventory space in the camp stash, and more great Quality of life changes you've added.
---
[With gun smith on a laser weapon it can do a whopping 35 connecting shots before it loses 1/4 of its bar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqMYBJqC8y4)
---
Heaven forbid we buff energy weapons to make them brokenly overpowered, they already added a whole 10% damage.
---
In flat number, for the laser rifle values, that's 6.
---
They have a fix for this already on PC you just build a macro and hot key it for vats, every time a crit is up it uses it regardless of gun. That's probably why PC and console have separate servers. I used to go this on all the older fall out games. Playing this one on a console and I miss it. Too mutch going on in large scale pvp to time that extra crit button imo. My experience in the game has been opposite, I do miss my insta crits but, have found full auto as my only option. It takes getting used to to hold down the crit button. As far a the jumping thing you have to monitor your action bar, there is plenty of stuff that increase action points and regen rates, that you dont seem to be taking into account.
---
It's been the opposite for me.  The dry lake at Summersville was particularly rough today.  It's definitely sub-60 fps.  Not enough to hurt gameplay, but enough to be noticeable.
---
He spawned in the ground for me at the AVR center... could only hear him lol
---
Just use a gay ray.
---
I dont know much about the wild appalachia so i have a question. Is it a pvo only mode? And can i access the new content on normal mode? Im out of the loop on everything new that is coming to the game. Though im exited for the new weapons myself and i hope that bethesda makes it so we can package ammo to sell it just luke there is bulking
---
Too bad the trailer is better than the sad excuse of a final product they pushed out and called a game
---
Hell yeah, Wisconsin! Now we just need to be able to tip them too
---
Yeah I'm just interested in the idea of new recipes with the brewing system that don't involve drinking alcohol. I'm a card carrying adult just not a fan of it in real life but would like to get in on the fun in game if without getting my character tipsy. 
---
Though not a demand, I get that I may just have to skip out on this content. 
---
Damn! That video made me want to buy it and I already own it 
---
True, they were playing actual music from the in game radio instead of classical, hopefully they saw that and will add it in the upcoming patches. 
---
That's not what the user above is talking about. They are talking about a couple of months ago when people said stealth had been nerfed because they jumped on a non-existent bandwagon to shout at Bethesda. It's a separate thing to what you're talking about, which is a recent bug.
---
I agree. I never had a problem with griefers but lately when I play with my SO, we always get attacked 
---
I ended up at the Mad Hatter's table which is funny cuz the Alice in Wonderland effect the Nukashine gives you.
---
I request o fortuna
---

---
Just because you disabled the mods doesn't mean your files aren't still messed up. You need to make sure the files reflect the new content
---
Not in yet, that's down the road a bit.
---
Alright thank you! I've been searching all day for info on it 
---
Seems pretty dark here, OLED though.
---
I don't have turrets either, and I still got a little extra space. 
---
I saw a few a while back but, then again, I've seen people complain about everything.
---
I love it but I feel like the PvP part gets skewed when people attack for no reason or think that it‚Äôs personal if you kill them when they‚Äôre wanted 
---
I got the mission to pop up! Took a break from playing for a couple hours, came back and Biv gave me the mission after I spammed A on him a bunch!
---
I have removed the door.  There is just rock behind the door.  If there is going to be something there, its not in the code yet!
---
If only it featured more things that came out already.
---
I was excited while watching the trailer, only to be disappointed when I realized I've got to wait for the stuff I'm actually interested in.
---
At least the game is getting updates.
---
The game doesn't have the player agency in the narrative and npc interactions the earlier games had, and that was important to a lot of long time fans including myself.
---
It was also catastrophically unstable even a few months after launch.
---
That said, I liked the game well enough as long as I had quests to do. I had some memorable times with friends too, when we weren't undercut by the technical failings of the game.
---
I'm not interested in loot grinding or farming the same few nuke zones over and over so I haven't been playing much since New year. I'll definitely come back when there's more PvE content though.
---
I still enjoy following this subreddit, mostly to see people's creative camp builds.
---
Yessir
---
Isn't 273 -&gt; 182 a 33% decrease, not 66%? 
---
Very nice.  I'm stuck waiting for my update, damnit.  
---
Don't get me wrong I think it would be a nuclear option but as a person who was a massively active seller (I don't say trader as I didn't buy) when the dupes started up I cannot even think of a good way to describe how quickly legit vendors went out of business, how quickly everyone had Arsenal's of tse and perfect armour on sale. I'll put it like this I'm honestly of the opinion maybe 1/1000 tse weapon is legit, and maybe 1/500 assassin's sentinel based on how quickly they exploded.
---
If they can come up with a way to wipe all of the dupes they honestly I'll be on board even if somehow I lose everything in it. Because ATM, I struggle to find the will to even log on not because of glitches or griefers or buggy PvP. simply because I loved trading, I spent hours browsing different discords and reddits looking for buyers, every waking moment was spent grinding for legendarys to add to my shop, but now I cannot even see a reason to do even an hour of grinding as if it's not a perfect weapon or armour chances say everyone all ready has better.
---
I think you're right about it being a random spawn.
---
Stopped by at night on a whim and didn't see any blooms. Stopped by at day randomly on different servers twice and saw blooms both times.
---
No Heart of the Swamp was running so I think that's not a requirement.
---
Did this work for you? I tried putting that text and still fall. Then i removed the file and still.

How did you start the daily again? Did you just server hop?

Hmmm the title of this book says 'To Serve Appalacians'.

I ran around Watoga today and took down maybe two dozen legendary protectrons, many of which came fresh out of their cans, and only had one instantly blew up in my face. Others usually blew up like 6 seconds or more after I dropped and looted them.
---
May 23 for that update
---
Using mods I assume? You have to update you're Fallout76Custom.ini. They changed it again.
---
Lost my junk too. =(
---
rip my new character..

In a related vein, is the "Inspect" option missing at Vendors now?  I don't seem to be able to see what the different \*'s on multi-\* items mean now.

Yeah about that rug... Where do you live? My friends and I would like to visit.
---
I personally hate it when the wanted person puts up so much of a fight. Like, you're wanted, someone is eventually going to kill you, why not just let me do it?? When I'm wanted, I just store my junk and take off all my armor, and wait. Either for a teammate or a random person. Only time I have come back to fight the person who claimed my bounty, was because they decided to turn on all my teammates. Other than that...please just take my bounty, I hate not seeing other people on the map
---
Not even close 
---
same here,  got pummeled today up in conifer,  its great.
---
Why don‚Äôt you cry about it
---
Nope 
---
That makes sense. I have missed npcs because I usually play a high charisma character 
---
I can't wait to try this!
---
I also noticed Miniguns are scrapping for 24 steel with Scrapper instead of 12. Looks like they buffed even the scrap produced by heavy weapons?
---
Some unmarked tree house in the Mire. Freaking LOVED it
---
Can confirm, it's new. Once had my camp over there. This will be interesting to see where it goes.
---
If you like partially complete $60 games go for it. 
---
I mean as a sometimes thing, like on moonless nights, or storms having the game get really dark, or certain caverns. Total darkness that can't be avoided and is constant can get really annoying, but as a rare and optional challenge it's something that I want to see.
---
Rather than taking away stuff or racking up a debt, I'd rather damage output correlate to the amount of bounty the player is able to provide. For example, bounty is 200 caps, player only has 150. Player's damage output to other players is -25%. A player with 50 caps and a 200 cap bounty would be nerfed by 75%. A player with 5 caps and a high bounty would be able to do virtually no damage at all.
---
Huh, that is odd. Guessing you've tried relogging and stuff?
---
I would move, just in case
---
Good, I've keep a legendary LMG and mini-gun and a fat man.  Can't wait for my 3hr update to finish!  This is huge especially for the LMG because even if the damage per minute remains the same due to the fire rate being decreased, it'll conserve on ammo by 10%.  It makes it a viable weapon now.  Also can't wait to try out the laser rifle now that rhe dammage has been increased.  May e can swap between the laser sniper and hunting rifle to conserve on ammo.
---
I crashed mid-rebuild and lost everything, it packed it all back up again and same error message on login.
---
I've been saying for the longest time they should give you a reason to equip the Science perks while doing actual stuff (rather than just crafting). Give them like "increased durability for energy weapons", "increased damage on energy weapons", and maybe "increased ammo efficiency on energy weapons" (for basic/expert/master).
---
Same situation here I‚Äôve completed every suggestion I‚Äôve seen online. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing even the devs aren‚Äôt sure the cause thus not able to probably patch the bug. 
---
/u/Aten_Ra more things to confirm and add to the unofficial bugs list.
---
Neat now I‚Äôll only need to carry one Gatling plasma instead of 3 
---
In Watoga are 2 or 3 PA Chassis. Also at Dropsite V9 spawns one.
---
Can you cite some bugs introduced by the last patch? 
---
ty for the tip do not have that recipe that I know of.

---
Northern part of the mire, watching two yao guai try to take on a megasloth.  Was dope, would repeat.
---
They may not consider it a bug, but they have acknowledged the issue. They report that they "need to introduce new functionality" to fix the issue while still allowing bulk to be used for crafting.
---
Here's a link to that thread:

Indefinete, once per X amount of minutes, or what? Does it have to be your own brahmin?
---
What's your total carry weight?  There was a note in the patch about people that are way over limit, see if that applies.
---
I think it's rather important to be able to look at your menu without getting run over when you choose to, that is why there are two different options you can quick swap between.
---
I am all for adding more menu customization, but you know, more, not losing one thing to gain a different thing.
---
More than likely it will teleport you once entering, be tougher to rearrange the terrain then to make a separate cell.
---
Also someone said it could lead to one of the upcoming underground areas which with the boxes could mean it was a vault being constructed.
---
About time!
---
Whoops, you're right. Got it backwards.
---
Lemonade
---
Are you extremely overweight to the tune of 1500 pounds? If so you can only destroy excess inventory. You cannot drop or consume it. (New in this patch)
---
Or have a mule like my mule and level it to 50 with all the weight reduction perks.
---
Not much.
---
It's barely noticeable. 
---
Takes up a lot of space though 
---
Oof. That sucks. I feel you. I think we will be fine but it is a bit sudden. 50% damage missing is not that nice.
---

I'm new to Reddit and don't know what I'm doing. But here is a link to the screenshot I took in the general location I'm at. I did rebuild a little bit of the camp almost identical to where I had it the first time. Logged out and logged back in, but didn't get a message that time. So then I made a couple of structures closer to the road, like I had the first time, and did the same process. The message came back up again and the camp was gone. So I'm thinking it's got to be something with being too close to "Black Mountain Ordnance Works" location maybe? 
---
*feels your pain* Yeah. Kicking myself for not uninstalling them before the patch. There will never be a BGS patch that doesn't break something.

There's a snack cracker joke in there somewhere

And the first misuse of reporting is reported!

Same Issue here, can log in, I take a few steps... Server Disconnected.
---
That‚Äôs the spot!
---
Lol you look into buy/sell? 
---
Scroll to the bottom with the mothman poster .......it's been posted a bunch of times
---
If you take a Rad-X before the RadAway it will temporarily block your mutation but I dont think you'll lose it entirely. Could just be a greatly reduced chance. I've never lost anything. 
---
You're probably right seeing that there are boxes by the entrance maybe it was under construction, similar to the vault we find Nick in in Fo4. 
---
Might house some super mutants, I've gone to the sawmill and have only seen super mutants spawn there so maybe they took a tunnel to get there.
---
Nope. 
---
Destroy.
---
It does work and it's not much budget at all. 
---
Yes, building in an area causes a reduction in foliage for that area. It was in the patch notes. 
---
How is this misuse?
---
Would those extra half dozen letters have killed you?

I ain‚Äôt worried

Rifle VATS build pulls me out of all bad situations 
---
I did it but still asking me to wait to ferment? Anyone else 
---
I got the same, they still consider drills to be legendary :(
---
Yeah, it's just a bit crazy that melee can still pump out 2-3k damage even without adrenal. 
---
So is the thicc end what I think it is?!
---
Did the debuff the bloodied build?
---
Yep brahmin milk!!!!
---
If that's lore then maybe, but the game treats them as separate.
---
I would do just about anything for that White Powder Jumpsuit.
---
I can pay caps or trade. 
---
Have some good armor pieces I think you might like.
---
It is way better
---
Or better yet.. have an actual ending scene for the game! So people can be satisfied. 
---
A big reason why tons of people enjoyed the past Fallout games was being able to horde items. This is a massive slap in the face to their loyal fans who have been playing this game since day 1.
---
And they call this an MMO and have a trading system but the stash limit makes it literally impossible to be a trader or run any sort of shop without muling and going overweight. Again another slap in the face to players who are trying to create an economy in an MMO that has no other economy.
---
The ignorant masses of redditors will incorrectly claim that this change punishes dupers and helps server stability when we already know for a fact that it does not. Dupers are already banned and we know that player items don't affect server stability.
---
This was just a terrible decision by a team that has repeatedly demonstrated that they are not capable of producing an MMO.
---
Yes, just confirmed this
---
Yea where do you obtain the daily quest?
---
I legit think it's to prevent ppl from nuking Morgantown during this event
---
My money is on Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice being blasted by the Dark Souls community for not being Dark Souls.
---
Well, that‚Äôs a pain in the ass.
---
You could hire specific employees for different trades in the mean time. Until you get all those plans under your belt. It could happen!
---
With this latest patch you can create new and old types of alcohol.  These will need to ferment in order to be used first though.  You can either wait till the condition meter reaches 0 and you will have the aged version of said drink, or you can use the fermenter to hasten the process.  You are only limited to 1 fermenter per camp, with it only able to ferment up to 10 drinks at a time.  These drinks placed within will also take up part of your 800 lb stash so if you're at max you will need to remove something from your stash to place something in your fermenter.  Also only drinks that have a condition will be able to ferment.  Spirits and wines can also be fermented a second time to make them have new and stronger effects.
---
I'm only level 43 though so it sucks for me. These guys are around level 120 so I have no hope of ending them before the kill me.
---
Yeeeessss!!! Yooouuu betcha!
---
I'm having this issue right now, I'm at 224/250, haven't played in a couple months.
---
People are reporting the same thing on the official forums. 10 days cool down for some.
---
I'm really hoping that's a bug and not a new cool down for silos. 
---
Keep in mind, increasing a weapon's damage reduces the effect of armor, so the lmg now has essentially 60% armor piercing compared to before (a/2.6), making it's effective dps FAR higher than the raw dps calculation would suggest. The minigun als0 makes almost 40% (a/1.7). So even with the huge reduction to rate of fire these weapons are going to have a much, much better effect on targets.
---
Too bad they just tanked the economy by making all traders' accounts unusable unless they delete their entire inventory.
---
Same here
---
I crashed on xb1 when I logged back in I was in the same spot in the mire. 
---
I‚Äôm still having fun after 100ish hours. Some ppl put too much stock in YouTube/twitch opinions.
---
It never worked for inspecting from vendors....
---
I picked up a paper bag in Whitesprings nuke zone in combat by selecting the take all option before even looking at it because I was surrounded by glowing ones. That put me up to over 800lbs, that's what got me suspended. It had hundreds of each flux and a ton of bulk. It was very stupid of me to not look first, and now I don't even pick up any paper bags on my new character unless a friend drops me stuff that I KNOW isn't duped. It sucks, but there are a few of us out here who have made stupid mistakes without actually duplicating, or knowing that things in the bag were duplicated. Had I looked before, I would have known, but I didn't, so I got flagged. 
---
I'd like to think this is the reason they made it to where you cannot drop large stacks of things into bags, if that's what it said they did earlier. I could only skim the patch notes. 
---
I was upset at first, but I can understand why I was flagged, and I'm not going to fight it anymore. I haven't for weeks. Just gotta get back up, dust your hands off, and try again. 
---
Yes but, on ps4 anyway, they're stored on the hdd so you can delete them in game without losing them.
---
Anyone know if the BOS paladin and knight paint job exist yet?
---
You opinion and you have the right to it, but this means few people some of us can help, and the dupers had hundreds of thousands of pounds, or millions, where the casual horder had 5,000...
---
I also noticed it‚Äôs very difficult to attach power connectors to your camp now. 
---
I woke up with my pants at my ankles and a scorchbeast blasting my bottom üòÖ
---
Plan or actual piece? Think I might have T51b right and left arm plans sitting in my Stash.
---
Yeah that's not the problem then, you'd have to be WAY over limit for the change to apply to you.
---
&gt;A new ‚ÄúDestroy‚Äù option will now appear in place of the ‚ÄúDrop‚Äù option when a player who has exceeded the absolute maximum weight limit of 1,500 pounds plus the character‚Äôs current carry weight views items in their inventory.
---
If that applies to you, you can't drop things, you can only destroy them (though other options may be available, but drop isn't one)
---
u/srsly_dang,  new goals?
---
I got different times from each silo....one was 187 hours! The other was 50!   Supposedly because the silo was recently used..... Theres no was to check the time before going through all the BS to launch? Wth
---
If you got it from the Featured menu in the atom store you probably don't have it. Get it from the C.A.M.P menu in the store. I noticed the Featured menu didn't give the unlock option.
---
Narc! I'm really liking it. This is a bug they should ignore.
---
I love the new NPCs
---
Thank you! 
---
My ex wife's definition of massive was 4 inches. 
---
I was just looking for the piece, but what are the plans worth?
---
Have they fixed a lot for he bugs?  I‚Äôve heard people losing gear they‚Äôve worked hours for, their camps getting trashed while offline, server crashes etc.
---
I knew I wasn't high! But that Yaoi Guai sure is! 
---
I love the new NPCs!
---
Can't argue with the "Slap in the Face" comment....   
---
Not going to jump on the last bit, I think it more points to being new into the industry than anything else, and it takes time to learn the quirks of MMO's, but it is frustrating as hell...
---
I was so excited to go out and fix my camp after not playing for almost a month. 
---
I joined and was immediately hit with the new move camp prompt so I decided to find a new campsite. 
---
I was 30 minutes into building and got hit with the ‚ÄúCannot move item: Part of the building would not be accessible‚Äù.  It stopped the whole process and I needed to move my camp to restart. 
---
I ended up just giving up because it‚Äôs the same bug I‚Äôve had since the beta in almost a dozen camps. 
---
Another thread made by someone in the infamous fallout honeymoon phase
---
I've had very few crashes yo jkne. No problems with my camp and only lost 1 of my guns that I found and was easy to get back. I really reccomend it.
---
Was it given to you? Quickly finished it before work and didnt see the rewards list post up 
---
Going to bet where...Freddy?  Was that the boy's name?  The one in the "Ransom of Red Chief" kidnapping scenario?  The Vault he was whisked off too when the time came.
---
Yep, its not limited to just camps it appears. I'm at a workshop and the same issue keeps occurring. Mildy frustrating when you get that conduit in the perfect spot. 
---
I feel like dubbing golf commentary over this would be shockingly appropriate. 
---
If you are using Better Inventory, remove it until it is updated. If you are using Save Everything, download the update.
---
I literally was there two days ago, crazy the things ye forget, I think the Nukashine damaged my memories....
---
If you're looking for the next game in the franchise, wait for FO5. If you want a fun, community focused online RPG, get FO76. 76 is great and it's easy to immerse yourself in it. Really all depends what you want out of the Game. But if you're a fan of the series, it's worth grabbing it. It has something for everyone
---
Download the update for the mod. I have heard others with the same issue. The updated mod fixed the issue.
---
The new mode is basically pvp with full damage from all players. All new content is coming to the base game in both modes.
---
PS4
---
I tried that first, downloaded the update and nothing.
---
I thought it was that closed botanical vault, but I might be crazy. I mean, I am replying to a 7-hour old comment.
---
They said 10% didn't they?  20 to 22 is... 10%.
---
There is a post by u/u3030 on the front page under hot posts. This post seems to cover a fix for this. I have not tested this myself. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/J4fnGCq
---
How so?
---
So would I. 
---
I enjoyed 76 way more than fo4
---
If you mean deleting it an reinstalling it, every time.  If you're being sarcastic and being all "well if you don't like it, don't play it, so there", I got nothing for you.
---
Can u send me a link on that pls
---
I also don't get it, how come you can put already fermented booze in there?
---
I get "the application is corrupted", or words to that effect.
---
yes
---
Hi all,
---
On PC, I have fixed this bug in the Save Everything mod (on Nexus.)
---
Good now I can report all the pricks who keep trying to PVP me when I clearly don‚Äôt want to. I had some asshole follow me around for a half hour one day because I wouldn‚Äôt sell him something out of my inventory.
---
Yeah I'd move. Tried to place mine near where it used to be and it made me move again on next log in
---
I've tried that, updating the file didnt do anything. So i removed it completely and still fall.
---
Maybe because the new trailer shows a bunch of stuff that isn't available yet.
---
I think the ‚Äúfermentable‚Äù booze is booze on its way to becoming regular booze. And from what I understand if you wait long enough it becomes vintage which gets it really cool effects. 
---
I use it as bait. Come take my 10 caps , if you dont one shot me I get your lvl in caps when I drop you.
---
You have officially been fooled by Bethesda. All of the workshops are doing that. But there's no sheepsquatch. Just mutants or whatever creature is normally there.
---
That edit you made, did you mean instead of 10% go for 100%?
---
That would be insane for these energy weapons, at level 45 the handmade has 45 ballistic damage so energy weapons are fine given the ways you can build them now. It was the durability that was killing energy weapons, damage seemed alright.
---
Just do it.
---
It‚Äôs quite amazing minus the occasional error.
---
Well they are sterile, the only way to make more supermutants is to expose humans to FEV
---
ThisüëÜ, my buddy is a melee build, he collects ammo for me all the time, enough to keep my heavy gunner/rifleman fully loaded. 
---
If you have good intentions then yeah it sucks to be you. But it took those the duppers to ruin it for everyone. I say good on Bethesda for atleast taking control of the game and trying to fix the situation. 
---
It's the trailer for wild Appalachia. That's the name of the current season of content, that's why it shows it all. The roadmap says exactly when and what 
---
As you can surely imagine, i would need more specific information about these armor pieces that i might like! :) You have a sheet or something?
---
Ah that's awesome!
---
I read you must pick up each lvl to unlock the next lvl.
---
The person I talked to said it might be using a backup copy of Fallout76Custom.ini found in Users/ME/Documents/my games/Fallout 76. Find that file and delete it. 
---
need to check that out as it is literally right by my camp
---
You rock that one was there. Did the new quest and blacked out woke in the bog lol ‚Äò‚Äòtwas a sign I guess. Killed a Scorchbeast got a daily done and got my chassis. Thanks! 
---
yeah you actually have to equip the weapon first. i was looking at the weapon in my inventory with out it being equipped. once you equip it, look at the weapon again, the damage should change 
---
I was wondering why that area of the map was so empty.
---
If you are on PC and need an immediate fix: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148)
---
HOW
---
I‚Äôve heard some buddies mention that it‚Äôs due to your mods. Either with Glowing Meat Piles or Perk Loadout Manager. Swap those out and see if you still have your issue.
---
Glad to help!
---
Turn off your mods
---
Theres a white Russian recipe you can get. I'll assume that's why milk is part of the game now. 
---
Awesome, I'll find out in a few hours for myself. 
---
Really hoping to be able to add a second level to my base and have it act as a party room with the distillery. 
---
Current base lol

when i put strange in numbers on it works in reverse..my gun damage goes down  and my mutations dont work properly..for example adrenal reaction works fine when strange in numbers is off...put strange in numbers on and adrenal reaction stops working..im guessing the other mutations not working either..havent tested it..also strangely my gun damage goes down when i put strange in numbers on
---
My semi auto laser is still garbage, can only get through a few clips before breaking
---
Hmmm that‚Äôs not a bad idea
---
In game? Only the enclave vendor. Or buy from another player. 
---
Lol. My whole building strategy in FO4 was foundation stacking. I didn't realize this was a bug.   I built 20 story high rises using this method. Wondered why we needed to do funny stuff in FO76 to get foundations to stack when FO4 made it so easy.
---
Noocice!  I'm still awaiting for the update but kept a legendary LMG and .50cal just for this buff.
---
I agree I‚Äôve sent messages but that seem to ignore me
---
How exactly ? All vaults are underground. And based on the plants and small trees, the two displayed are the same and already known where plantlife went bananas. The first one on the video seems different.
---
South of Camp McClintock
---
It's in the new trailer so you aren't spoiling much üòâ
---
I dont know yet but isnt it aging?
---
I'm one of the idiots who paid full price for pre-order. I've been playing everyday since launch. The game is not perfect, but it's fun if you like to build your own house, grind legendary and kill giant flying bats. I play the game solo, the lone wanderer type. Sometimes you get attacked (PvP) by griefers, sometimes some level 300 just wants to give you plans and serums to make you into the next ~~Hugh Jackman~~ Wolverine. Overall, the community is pretty positive, no matter how Bethesda abuse us with their flawed patches, we stayed and provide suggestions. The graphics are similar to FO4, but the gameplay is rather different and feels refreshing.
---
Any news on fixing iron sights/scopes? 
---
It is, but at the natural time
---
I'm guessing they're sitting in wait in camo. That's why it looks like they're gone.
---
Please learn to use the screenshot function on your system.
---
If you have mods installed, then thats the problem...
---
Mod author Keretus has a [fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124?tab=bugs) in his forums, [Better Inventory](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) hasn't been fixed yet, but he's working on it. Haven't checked on any others
---
I‚Äôve heard the grognax mentioned here a bunch before 
---
The nuke glitch....wtf is that?..
---
That works even on the map?
---
I know it's a silly question but where would the enclave vendor be?
---
I checked my lmg legendary 3e
---
 and didn't see that big if a buff but maybe I'm just looking at it wrong. Would be nice for sure 
---
That's nearly the same as Vault 96.
---
dang really? i have the inventory mod. guess i have to turn if off
---
Those defense walls take up soooo much space.
---
I haven‚Äôt even used my 50 Cal because the MG42 does the same damage per shot but shoots twice as fast
---
Thanks for the explanation. 
---
Hear hear.
---
Thank you for posting this.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the first beta and I‚Äôve enjoyed playing. It‚Äôs a fun game and more fun if you have friends. 
---
Honestly though, even with this update, it‚Äôs not really the game it should‚Äôve been. I put the game down for a month and picked it back up for this update and there are still major bugs that have been there since day one. 
---
It‚Äôs great they‚Äôre adding content but they‚Äôre adding content on to a shaky foundation. 
---
If anything I‚Äôd wait 6 more months to pick it up. Every time I play I think how much better it could have been if they had pushed release back a year. 
---
wooo you're right! deleted it and im all good
---
GT Fuzzygrundel. My camp is just east of the Miners Monument. On the junk pile just outside of the Whitespring golf course. 
---
No nihilists. I mean, say what you want about the tenants of nationalism dude, but at least it's an ethos!
---
Idk if it‚Äôs stated, is it? But I get the feeling that they put so anti-physcotics in it. The books and the people, they really make it suspicious. . .
---
Food and rested bonuses seem to disappear if you log out. 
---
Only the booze you make will do something in the fermenter AFAIK
---
You go in towards the end of the big main quest line. Which means you probably aren't that far in the game. Just hit the FO76 marketplace and save your caps 
---
Mine did this too. Installed the patch, logged in and updated my camp with a bunch more turrets thanks to the update and all was well. 
---
Did a server hop into a blast zone and all of a sudden my camp can‚Äôt be placed due to this error. Did a couple more server hops and I either get this error or that someone‚Äôs already in my camp spot. 
---
Funny thing is, I can also just ‚Äúrelocate‚Äù my camp to the exact same spot with no issue, so clearly the area is buildable. 
---
20gb, well that‚Äôs gonna take a while to download ^^‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind the wait though 
---
Specify I don‚Äôt understand
---
I‚Äôm having what I believe to be a mod-related issue. Different from the OP, but one directly tied to my own. I haven‚Äôt solved it yet, and now you have me wondering: is Bethesda now archiving the FalloutCustom.ini elsewhere that may be causing his (and my) issue. Deleted my own FalloutCustom.ini a long while back in my own debugging process, but if there were a hidden one somewhere else, that could very well be the source of my problem.
---
Pacified a creature under the effect of rum, nothing happened. This quest might be bugged.
---
&gt; And your username reeks of elitist garbage so what's your point?
---
Dunno if *enseminator* should really be whining about anyone else's shitty username...
---
The problem is in the custom.ini file. Some fixes have been made. Not sure if it works with all mods.
---
My Semi auto laser is still unusable, I was hopeful.. maybe next time
---
The Enclave vendor is in the Whitespring Bunker
---
The first Legendary Ghoul I killed after the patch gave me a normal Drill. I even have a screenshot of the loot list.
---
Another good thing to note is there may be a second custom files saved under:  Users/(you)/Documents/my games/Fallout 76 
---
Have hope: my buddies fixed their issue. Most just downloaded fresh mods. 
---
Thank you! üëç
---
Is there a way to see it without having to login to youtube?
---
oic.   i need to read more lore it seems.  
---
any good resources/synopsis?   
---
id love to read it, but i dont like wiki format.  
---
I also had my cap in there, I loved that spot. Nothing ever attacked me and no one ever bothered me. Happy to sacrifice it for a new vault though! Excited to see what this turns into.
---
While some players can craft and sell them (the plans are just about the most expensive thing in the game), and while you can get them by exposing yourself to extreme radiation, and while sometimes you can (very rarely) get them from fighting the queen the only way to buy a mutation serum is from the science bay in the Whitespring Bunker. They're quite expensive: about 4,000 caps. But at least you've got the advantage of no negative effects for about an hour or so.
---
I'm so on the fence about it haha. It is pretty cool to see especially because I prefer the soft yellow lighting over the bright white.
---
I thought they changed there mind in bringing toons over to survival?
---
&gt; said no one ever
---
UGH exactlyyyy
---
No, a lot of people actually
---
Ahh, within the laser locked room. üëç
---
As the guy who also does the Perk Manager Mod, or at least you have the same name here as on Nexus, you're the hero Bethesda needs, but doesn't always deserve. 
---
Can also get the poster for free from atom shop and place at your base.  Thought it was a nice touch to get the quest rolling.
---
There was a way to use your PA and skip to the end of the silo from the beginning there are videos on YouTube about it. It just got patched with todays patch.
---
I dunno how to feel about this. It doesn‚Äôt seem sporting 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0oa2g/psa_mod_users_and_those_with_a_fallout76customini/
---
Just discovered this and this is bs.
---
I'm not going to willy nilly buy a 3 star and not know what it does. 
---
I did, one. And this sub is quite high traffic. You don't see most of posts.
---
Yes and No...  
---
My point is the threshold for forced scrapping should be the number you can have with Weight Reduction perks and armor, because not everyone has the time to do what I did.
---
It worked on PC. 
---
I was chilling in my camp today just decorating and what not when I started to hear footsteps. I turned around and there was another high level player standing behind me. He waved for me to follow so I did. He brought me to his camp that was quite literally next door to mine that I had no idea existed. It was pretty cool getting to see another person's camp.
---
Bunch of people sell them for 200 a pop 
---
Wow, I never even heard of it before just now. 
---
Well heh start drinking that inert flux because that's all you can do with it.
---
It's an app on the phone called A-Bomb radio. Or you can find them on tune.in. Whole station is dedicated to Fallout type music. 
---
Sounds like a good investment if I start to craft. Thanks
---
Win10.    Documents/my games/fallout76/ fallout76custom.ini is the file. Deleted it and fixed my problem. Hear there's a fix out but haven't had a chance to try it. Will be after work.
---
Shhhh don‚Äôt give away the main ingredient &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt;  then the devs straighten things out. 
---
Bwahahahaha.....oh your being serious, sorry.
---
Still two steps forward, one step back. Lets add brewing and neglect all the other annoying bugs that have been present since day one.
---
Shit, good point!  
---
If you make bourbon from the distiller, that will convert to bourbon faster 
---
I've run across a couple of them but they never seem to come through with the serum. Always some sort of a delay. 
---
I honestly have to say that it was so much fun, definitely wasn't expecting that to happen. I was playing with a buddy and we drank at the same time so when we both woke up on opposite ends of the map we about died laughing. It may have been a shot lived quest but none the less it was a lot of fun.
---
Does triggering self destruct make bots instantly explode as well?  
---
I haven‚Äôt played in almost a month and came back to try out the new update. 
---
Less than an hour in and I was hitting bugs that I experienced in the first beta. I love base building and was excited with the new updates but hit the same bug with floating/inaccessible building pieces and gave up. 
---
I love new content but I‚Äôm worried about the already shaky foundation. I think they should have a good balance of new content and bug fixes but maybe more of a focus on bug fixes. 
---
I thought the most funny fix was the assultron head laser. Jeez that thing has been eating peoples fusion cells for so long.
---
Yeah it' pretty cool.
---
Holy shit and i just placed my camp nearby because i wanted to farm that acid mineral spot
---
New genera or is hipster metal already a thing? 
---
That was it! Thanks very much dude! 
---
NUKE IT. 
---
sandman noted there is basically a cookie of that file that messed me up  Users/(you)/Documents/my games/Fallout 76 
---
Here‚Äôs hoping it worked for ya. And yeah, I deleted that particular FalloutCustom.ini as one of the first few steps in my debug process. Still waylaid with my own set of problems. Good luck with yours!
---
If you know where T-51 armor is go there but don't take the armor. Just server hop until it spawns the part you need.
---
I know, how do you start the thing though
---
Sorry Bro but thats pretty funny.
---
Also why I dont build on ground level. 
---
Actually, I had also removed the doors for the other vaults.  You are no longer able to enter those either.  I guess they have added new content and do not want anyone actually getting in!
---
Yes!
---
I've been playing since launch and I've loved every minute of my experience. Fallout 76 has been incredibly fun and honestly, it's addicting :)
---
This is active now or at a later date? Some things in the notes were reserved for the future from what I remember 
---
*Entering an area doesn't spawn mobs like it used to? Example: Just north of Whitesprings there is a super mutant hut. Normally, I can stand by far away and see a pack of mobs, shoot and kill them, and then as I get closer they vanish and spawn again. Now I cruise over, and not a single mob spawned?*  ==&gt; it's an exploit actually :)
---
btw, does scrapper give Screw now? havent tested it.. 
---
Thats how I discovered it. There was a 3 star chest piece and I went to check it out. 
---
Meanwhile my TSE gatling laser took a DPS nerf due to the rate of fire changes.
---
Durability is a nice improvement though. Just still a shame. Wondering if now would be a good time to swap out the charging barrel for a 'normal' fire rate barrel just to see if this was an oversight by the devs.
---
Only have a lead deposit here but i have 7 water pumps hooked up lol
---
Let me know if you find that legendary that fell through the world before I could loot it.
---
there is a high chance at running into them at lucky hole mine. but there is also a chance at mole miners there
---
Now I can get rid of that bulky ass jukebox
---
I would not put it past them. They read Reddit and I bet someone has installed all of the mods to see if they work and how they work. It would be very easy for them to put original code some where else. Then set the code to look for it in "these file locations."
---
Or a good idea is merging the existing Science cards into a succinct 5 Star Card with all the bonuses outlined at the top tier.
---
1 step forward 2 steps back.
---
Thank you! I think I'll give it a shot
---
The minigun's damage is still really low so I'd be concerned with how it would perform against heavily armored , but just tried the LMG and its definitely viable now.  The .308 ammo for it is a pain to craft though in large quantities, and the 75 round drum sure gets empty quick.  I don't have any miniguns on me to test with, but so happen to have a 1* Instigating LMG on my gunner that I haven't sold off, so played with that for a few minutes outside West Tek.  Had just enough ammo to clear out the front yard of muties (200+ rounds).
---
It's an overall buff regardless because you can actually use it for more than 3 cores before breaking. 
---
That's a very "Fallout" thing to have.
---
Have to drink wine and score a critical hit. Doesn't work however i try it. 
---
Wrong. 
---
That's still a step forward...
---
It seems to vary by the in-game weather. Some nights are really dark, and others I feel like I have to look at my pipboy time to even know that it's night. And I never can see anything in the mire. Even during the day. I'm glad they brightened it a few patches ago. For me, it was literally unplayable at night. The first time I played during the beta, I ran around Flatwoods in circles because I couldn't tell where I was or where I was going.
---
Why can‚Äôt they just drop the whole DLC instead of in bits?
---
The game may not be perfect yet but there have been many MMO that follow the same suite.
---
Does the effect repeat with the one you brew yourself?
---
OP is clearly Sierra Petrovita
---
Ah ha, thank you. I knew there was another spot that was hidden but I wasn't sure where. 
---
fux u
---
It was made well before the 23 ok it was just released to the public on the 23 (slaps glasses of nerds face)
---
That's a hard sell for me. I know where you're coming from, but with the charging barrel and the repair perk it tended to last a lot longer than my other energy weapons.
---
That being said; I'm having a wonderful time destroying things with my cryolator. That is with the crystallizing barrel, as the normal cryo still burns through durability like no ones business. Same for flamers, I'm curious if Two-shot might be to blame. As both my flamer and two-shot cryo burnt through durability quickly. 
---
Where as the crystallizing vampire lasts a good amount of time even when fully firing clips full auto.
---
I'm not sure I haven't tried it yet
---
Try "Devil Woman"
---
So you describe not server hopping and then say you have to. So your perk card works in a new cool way you didn't expect however that left you realizing this and causes you to rapidly log out and log back in while your in the radiation. 
---
So what your saying is you are above level 50 and used to brokenness and you luck-sacked your way "post patch(which would itself present as a exploit if its actually true) sitting in rads and expecting us to believe you) without logging out and back in right after getting "those" mutations. 
---
I HAVE QUESTIONS.  MAAAMMMMM!
---
Indoor, outdoor or both?
---
Fo76map.com
---
I honestly want to eat it either way, damn you
---
Nothing to start. Just add the fermentable item. Check it again in about 10 minutes.
---
Yeah let's just ignore the massive bug fix section in the changelogs.
---
Yeah, I'm happy they're actually listening and making some changes.  Hopefully this isn't the last.  I'm hoping they have people working there that try out different builds besides melee, rifle and shotgun and are working to make every build and weapon viable.  
---
I might just make a new character at some point in the future, after most the changes are done just to experience the game the way it was ment to be played.
---
To get inside the bunker you‚Äôll have to complete the quest ‚ÄúOne Of Us‚Äù. It‚Äôs trigged by going to the Abandoned Waste Dump in the Mire region. 
---
So far its stable again for me. The only thing I changed is I had the Bethesda Launcher verify the game files, and I noticed a Nvidia update and did that. (Likely not the cause, but did it anyway) \*Crosses Fingers\*
---
You could argue multiple possibilities here.  Either someone at the frat got some of the advance testers from the Capital Wasteland area, or Vault Tec got an advance case for VTU that they got into, or they had a contact at the bottling plant who smuggled them out some before they went to stores
---
If on Ps4, I'll build you one for 20 screws.
---
Stock up on the 5.56 ammo!
---
It could of been released there early as the plant is a few miles away. Idk
---
Cows can now be milked!
---
Try the power substation just north of watoga, there's regularly a few there (and a deathclaw that'll also try and kill them so best hurry when you get there)
---
Where the hell did you get the booze recipe needed for the challenge? 
---
Congrats, you won't have problems launching nukes!
---
No. They really do blow up immediately.
---
How did he build there? 
---
Wouldn't really be hidden if everyone knows about them 
---
I stopped playing for an hour. Came back, spammed A on Biv. Quest popped up. 
---
I hope they just keep adding little things like this to the open world
---
Ive been a near daily player since launch. Good memories with this game.
---
.......was JUST about to post this. Us too. WTF?
---
We believe in nothing!
---
It in the patch notes that they fixed :)
---
Nevermind, though I was logged in Longer, I just got disconnected... guess ill wait till the servers calm down?
---
And lets ignore the day one bugs NOT on the list.
---
Curious change.
---
I'm with everyone else. You're being really toxic. I'll criticize games that I like, but I don't criticize games I don't like because I don't like them and bias doesn't help form a constructive opinion.
---
Which platform are you on? I've met quite a few legit serum traders on PS4. 200 caps.

So more than double the the fire rate, about 10% less damage, more than double the accuracy. 
---
Good god I'm going to go through a ton of .308
---
Inb4 it takes more space to build one radio than a missile turret.
---
This update was awesome! And the budget for the camps thank you! I spent a couple hours making a huge base with all that budget. Thank you! 
---
Frack yeah!!!
---
Yep can confirm, I got absolutely wrecked by a guy with an explosive MG42 today.
---
The official one linked to here in the side bar 
---
Your not loosing anything. Your player model will simply look at their arm while you still look at your characters back. 
---
This is listed in the patch notes, glad to see this fixed though.
---
Harpers ferry vendor buidling has also beer hat, and you are likely to visit it anyway.
---
Watoga spawns 4 power armor sets. Took me a few times they the to find the t51 pieces I needed. You'll find t45 and t60 as will so just server hop. 
---
I appreciate this too!
---
Honest question: I feel that 10 turrets was on par with my expectations, but 50 lights? That's a lot (imho)! I love lighting, as it can do wonders for your CAMP. Does anyone believe this is not enough? No judgments here; I'm just curious.
---
I don't dislike the permanent but it's still a menu to click through and something to think about. Not like everyone will just constantly switch builds. I'm lazy and the extra aloot isn't that big of a deal.
---
TBH I've had one addiction in a couple hundred hours.  Seems way more forgiving then the old fallouts.  I tend to drink alcohol in passing for str and use bufftats for str as well.pretty often.
---
I didn‚Äôt get it with tricentennial edition, just got PA paint, weapon paint and some posters
---
This nerd thinks bag to a time when moonshiners wanted to mix their moonshine with a soda. They tried the usual sodas or pops. Nothing lived up to their moonshine. Someone invented a mountain dew like soda and that did the tick. Thus now we have a new soda/pop for the masses. 
---
slightly less annoying but still enough of somthing to remember to switch out that perks don't lose their purpose.
---
I know, it's only my opinion
---
The game is not "intended" for the mule char to exist in the first place, the fact that you can do it, is nice but not guaranteed. 
---
They put a limit,  there was a grace period of a month to reduce the excess. 
---
It should be in the clothes section of the armor workbench I think. I have the heads both clean and dirty as well as the red white and blue outfit both clean and dirty. 
---
How do we find Nukashine?
---
Maybe a way to prevent the new quest area getting nuked for a bit?
---
Yes so much. My kitchen in my camp is Nuka Cola themed. Someone data mined the upcoming atom shop items and there's a nuka red cooking stove I can't wait for. The first thing I spent my atoms on was the Nuka Cola stash box
---
Before this patch I couldnt get over 800 even at 10-5% it capped at like 866. Before patch #6 I was doing 1100 at 20% when patch 6 was released I noticed I never could get over 870 no matter how low my health was. Now that they fixed adrenal reaction my damage is back to 1100. 
---
Now I have to tape my glasses again. LOL
---
How?
---
You learn it as part of the new quest chain that came out today. Just got to a train station and look for a poster advertising a kegger (or the atom store for free). That'll set you on the path.
---
Other people can access your fermenter!?
---
Suppose the problem is there isn't exactly any dialogue to use
---
The single serve serum is 4k. The plans are 20k. Just FYI.
---
I had my camp there too,  near the firefight/ bird watch place
---
Thanks! 
---
Perhaps they are preparing for the vault raids early? Making sure there's plenty of raids to run late game, but maybe it's part of the Wastelanders series of Quests? Perhaps it's a Vault-Tec Workshop scenario where we got a vault to ourselves lol
---
I occasionally run into them inside Fort Defiance (Allegheny).  
---
Why are you here then
---
Xbox One X
---
To reddit
---
My camp was there once. 
---
Same here got 3 events in the same area big als-harpers ferry 
---
One of those was him lol he got lead in return 
---
My thoughts is that the original recipe called for nuclear waste, which can be substituted for sufficiently radioactive Nuka-Cola, ala Quantum. 
---
But in all honesty; it‚Äôs gameplay balancing most likely. Can‚Äôt have you making ridiculously good consumables without rare components. 
---
In the devide on a cliff looking at a prewar tight rope setup complete with viewer platform and TV camera

Give it time.
---
Any mods?
---
IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR RADIOS IM SO HAPPY!!! THE JUKEBOX IS SO REPETITIVE AMD ANNOYING IM SO HAPPY 
---
Im being attacked as well
---
I think the confusion comes from a change that must have happened in a recent patch which I missed in the notes.  Basically if I own a workshop and someone claims it from me the slap damage system doesn't engage again until one team kills the other.
---
I used to join the people who took my workshop for the defend event they got upon capturing.  Sometimes they were good sports and we had a "no hard feeling" chat, most of the time they were complete tools over the mic and attacked me immediately.  The last couple weeks they have been showing hostile to me when I go back, even after letting them take it while remaining in a different region of the map, even after clearing the "retake x workshop" event from the pip boy, even after I *left my friends team who had the workshop taken* the group who captured it still dealt full damage to me and the turrets attacked on site as though I were hostile.
---
If this isn't a bug it was an incredibly big change that wasnt highly documented and is leading to a lot of the confusion.
---
Are you part of a BoS group? PC?
---
Sorry man ps4 has a couple guys I‚Äôve bought from that are great.  
---
Not sure about Xbox 
---
Spoil fast 
---
My problem is with no mods. The Power Armor mods I bought from vendors are doing it. No mods from others installed.
---
I will trust me I get so excited when i see a 5 cap bounty i start having seizures on the floor. On a more serious note im not just talking about players with a bounty on their head im just talking about people in general carrying no caps so they cant lose anything if they die
---
How many you can have?
---
...but YAY we can milk cows and drink beer. 
---
Tbh didn‚Äôt find new bugs nor any of the old ones so far and that‚Äôs lovely 
---
I went to one of those train tracks in the sky in cranberry bog. My friend went slightly east of vault 76 lol
---
Interesting idea
---
Flamer has actually always done good damage (not amazing, but good), but as you said, the ammo is so stupidly expensive, and no, they did not change that unfortunately.
---
You forgot to mention the new bugs introduced with the patch.
---
I actually went through Wendigo Cave this evening, post patch, and was on constant danger, though nothing seemed to be alerting to me. Everywhere else in Appalachia I went seemed fine. 
---
I saw you guys in my lobby the other day, you took over the workshop next to new gad.
---
nothing else to say i sorta mind my own business 
---
I think they're responsible for making the Sheepsquatch because there are several animal pens in the building and there were items you could collect that were labeled as "recipes" but did nothing
---
I had heard it but I just watched the video for the first time , loved it!
---
Honestly, I know it may be a little cheap, but the food and water bar should degrade slower as well
---
The Salvaged Assaultron Head no longer consumes all Fusion Cell ammo when fired for the first time.
---
But do they use up all ammo when fired a second time?
---
Those bots are unbearable
---
Nobody knows yet, but my speculation is yes to both. And I'm okay with that!! New game mode, new character. 
---
that's all? I'm sitting at 240 with my bloody, 15% vats gain, 25% fire rate LMG.... it's scary
---
emphasis on before.
---
The point of this post is the the game has advanced.
---
Yes, because you need to be crouching 
---
Been there from launch and apparently still on my honeymoon üòÅ
---
I actually got one a couple days ago from a mirelurk queen 3\*\*\*. 
---
This game is üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
---
were you on a team?
---
not quite the same (if you have a heavy barrel, I suppose). 50cal still does about 15% more damage, and uses much easier to craft ammo. But the fire rate and accuracy of the LMG means its DPS is waaaaay higher.
---
I‚Äôm not sure. That‚Äôs part of what I want to find out. 
---
I hear you. some of us find building to be end game and they still haven't fixed bugs from beta that break building content. it's disappointing.
---
The combat armor helmet?
---
You want the good news or the bad news? Like most patches some things fixed and others broken. 
---
You‚Äôll get there
---
* **Heavy Weapons:** High rate-of-fire automatic heavy weapons have had their fire-rates reduced across the board, and weapon damage has been increased by +10% to maintain their original damage per second.
---
* **Dev Note:** For high rate-of-fire heavy weapons, we wanted to drastically increase their effective damage per second against armor without pushing their baseline damage per second too high. This change in fire-rate provided room for a damage increase to help punch through armor more effectively.
---
Dear Bethesda stop trying to balance Firearms through DPS. Balance them through handling
---
The game made me allocate enough space for 58GB but then the patch was only 13GB. lol wtf who knows?
---
The annoying thing is that, well .... this means any other legal green spot MIGHT also be prohibited. I guess I'll maybe place it somewhere and just leave it empty for a while.
---
I found him north of Bog Town, just west of the road behind a shack in a small clearing. South East of Mac's Farm. 2 Colonel Gutsys patrolling nearby. Look closely for blue and yellow balloons. And he's loud when he shouts.
---
Hm I just saw the male one, I‚Äôll have to check it out üëç
---
The point is so you dont nuke the events to just be funny like on new years
---
This is another good idea
---
It didnt make me move it  ... twice. But 3rd re-login and it did. Now I just have to hope the next supposedly green target is really green. :)
---
I hope we do need new characters, and I think we won't appear on the map but we'll see.
---
It‚Äôs really not weird for Fallout. Caesar‚Äôs Legion made the vast majority of their armor out of sports equipment, and pieces of tire are used in some Raider armors.
---
Are we only allowed one Vintage Nukashine at a time? Cause I was trying to craft more than one thanks to Super Duper but when I checked, I only had one? 
---
Order corn
---
If they're coming up me to collect the Bounty they've already agreed to PVP seems open game to me
---
Had Bethesda responded to this? I feel like the community managers didn‚Äôt even know. 
---
Why can‚Äôt they let players play the game, instead of trying to force us to play the way they want us to?
---
Lmao my Fallout name is fight-milk 
---
there wasn't a budget increase though. they decreased the cost of turrets and lights but capped the turrets to 10 and lights to 50.
---
The patch hit today.
---
5 minutes later I completed all the new content. I can now brew rum at my camp using a process that is entire more cumbersome than just running into any given random house and finding 2 bottles of it on the floor.
---
Did you complete the majors mission too? Because that fixed the problem back then... had to run like hell with my unyelding built 
---
I'm using an ultracite MG42 so that's probably why the damage is roughly the same. Ultracite 308 also crafts 81 rounds at a time with ammo Smith so it's much easier to make a lot of ammo.
---
Yeah I rather have a new toon because if not everyone is going to range from a bunch of different level griefing the lower levels and etc 
---
Wild Appalachia is just the name of the new DLC ‚Äúseason.‚Äù
---
Survival mode will come soon and that will be PVP. 
---
They are only related because they are launching in the same window.
---
That's the one from the waterpark right?
---
I was wondering which vault he got into, considering this one has play equipment it may be the Scouts questline that was mentioned in the road map which would also tie into him being a kid. 
---
It probally won't end well though.... 
---
Ugh no, I'm sorry. I was thinking the wetsuit. I'm all doped up on nyquil, my apologies. 
---
Pre or post today's patch?
---
I've seen a few posts since the update about sights not working on various guns. 
---
Wow I never heard of an enemy dropping an outfit..that's wierd 
---
High up on a train in cranberry bog. Between watoga and that bos place (can‚Äôt remember the name)
---
Yeah I just tried.  Mine says 40 hours. Haven't launched a nuke in over a week myself. 
---
Before the update I liked them, could literally kill each and of them without them fighting back lol 
---
Oh, absolutely. Their entire ad campaign for 76 was fucking brilliant. The reveal for 76 was a stroke of genius.
---
&gt;and some dude in power armor took the lighter.
---
Lel.
---
Honestly like i said before if you are a pacifist you shouldnt bother with workshops at all they are pvp areas
---
My friends helped me complete that quest a couple of weeks ago..but now I'm scared to go to watoga lol
---
You can't blame BGS for your misfortune when you make the personal choice to use mods on an online game with zero official mod support. 
---
Im on ps4 and my frame rate at my camp earlier was really bad after update.
---
Today I waited patiently for a lvl 1 to came out of the vault,  I left stims, radx, radaway food water and a machete...
---
He was surprise...
---
There's literally a dialog box that pops up telling you claiming it may engage you in PvP. The game informs you that it's a PvP zone. Contesting workshops is an intended mechanic. Taking them is not griefing, it's part of the game.
---
Took a break to focus on AC:Odyssey and have to say - I'll have to get back to 76 soon.  :)
---
I can hook you up if you're on xbox
---
Regarding the assaultron head fix, this is good news. I just found a Quad Assaultron head an hour ago, so it‚Äôs a good time to take that for a spin.
---
lol OP is talking like this is going to change everything and literally it allows you to spend hours brewing a bottle of alcohol, the same alcohol that you run by 500 times literally lying in the streets while you collect the materials needed to make it.
---
Keeps being radrats üò´
---
Omg is that a nuka cola speak easy inside a nuka vending machine!!!!!!   
---
Do you have a berserkers weapon?
---
The only thing that sucks right now is no nuke launching it seems. Almost everyone I've seen post something about it says they have a cooldown before they can launch.  Mine is 40 hours. Haven't launched a nuke in over a week. 
---
Sucks but they are probably doing it so trolls can't nuke the new stuff,  or it's just a bug. 
---
Exactly, which acted as a budget increase. If you feel like being super literal than no, but in reality lets say you had 100 budget. They take 20 of the most important things and they say okay, these are half as costly. You now effectively have the budget of 20 of the most important items you own halved i cost increasing your personal budget
---
I had 32 lights (mostly oil lights with a single windmill generator) before the patch and it was not enough light at night to see. BUT my current camp is in the mire and night time is really dark.
---
every light counts as one no matter they're brightness or lack of brightness. I don't use neon lines (they cost too much budget before) but I imagine there may be some upset by the restrictions...
---
Wait
---
1) How does one obtain Brahmin, the Fertilizer Producer?
---
And
---
2) how tf do you milk em
---
Just play the game the way it's meant to be played. 
---
Nah not that rare..plus black powder rifles are way too slow to reload 
---
Nice find, it's great to see they plan to have more vaults...Perhaps Vault 65 will have npcs in it unlike the dead vaults?
---
Yes, why? It's affecting any weapon I use. 
---
post your character build and armor loadout. I'll tell you what you need to change if you want to survive casual engagements.
---
My first thought too.
---
On a mountain near the racetrack workshop.
---
If you are taking ‚Äúslap‚Äù damage then resting in the bed will heal you faster than the person can damage you. I‚Äôd be less worried about that than people messing with your CAMP.
---
Oh nuts, that's the kicker. Oh well!
---
I guess it comes down to play style. I do all my selling first thing when I log on and then go out hunting. I'm not going to carry around the weight of those guns to sell the next day. I'll end up with tons of purified water and stimpacks at the end of the day to sell the next and not be encumbered.
---
Honestly I hope this is true.  The last time these were for sale it was from the dev room incident on PC.  I know people that have and can still apply paints, but with no word on their legitimacy, they don‚Äôt use or offer them.  Same for Military and Winter paints for the T60.  If anyone else gets em please post, I know people are curious.
---
why
---
In the middle of a lake in the mire. I'm not even level 30 yet so it was quite the surprise
---
If this is specifically related to the quest, look at the note tacked to the machine. That will then allow you to use the fermenter.
---
Yeah, it looks that way. Bethesda strikes again
---
Deal
---
Only two, one that makes the crystals on the scorched glow and another that makes the power armor HUD less obtrusive. Think those could be whats causing the issue?
---
GAHHHH. I should've known better than to "simply go to Mordor" during a patch. I was out of power armor and loaded with junk.
---
FELL RIGHT THROUGH THE FLOOR.
---
Thanks for this PSA. My first thought was that Bethesda said "hold my beer" in regards to seeing how much they could screw up.
---
Yeah, night vision is pointless right now.
---
I'm being literal yes. I'm aware that yes it freed up budget by decreasing light and turret cost but even Bethesda said "we are not increasing build budget" 
---
it's still limited and the building is still buggy. overall when building is my end game, I'm disappointed. 
---
I'm glad I'm alone i guess.
---
LOL Yep, time to do some dealing.
---
Never had somebody mess with my CAMP honestly. The idea seems overblown.
---
I would like that too...
---
When can we expect to become un-banned?  
---
    ( I grabbed bags of duped items during the duper raids, and kept some, and passed most out free, usually on here to others to prevent ppl paying everything they had for a gg item.)
---
Am I innocent? Nope,. But I didn't fucking dupe.
---
Nor profit besides my own fun.
---
I love messing with the ghouls..I will be on top of the bus and they hide ..I jump down they all come to get me and then I shoot them.. repeat
---
Berserker‚Äôs weapons damage go up when you have less DR so that would explain it. 
---
Double check with a weapon that isn‚Äôt berserker‚Äôs. If you are positive that it does the same thing with a non-berserker then there‚Äôs some bug where that legendary effect carries over to other weapons when you swap them, or something like that. 
---
Erroneous. We just went through without cheating -like adults- and it was a 187 hour countdown. You'd think that eventually these guys would get something right. I'm just going to milk a cow instead. Yay. 
---
well that might be a bug where certain legendary effects affect you even while just carrying the equipment that has them. But berserker specifically says lower armor for higher damage.
---
It's for all 3 varieties of this light.
---
You were the one that claimed the suspended accounts were lifted. The burden of proof is kinda on you.
---
Are the tin man, aqua man and evilconevil costumes already in game?
---
More people should use cryolaters against scorch beasts.  They literally freeze them in the air.
---
Yeah it's doing it when I swap weapons to a non-berserker piece too. How weird. 
---
Valve hasn't officially given up on Artifact as far as I'm aware but I wouldn't blame them if they did. What's it averaging right now? 500 peak concurrent player? That's fucking pathetic. 
---
This would be my best guess for a lore explanation.
---
The same Battlefield devs that decided simply changing the TTK of every single weapon in the game, was a better, more subtle option? lol. The last people I'd ever refer to about game balance is DICE. They never get it right and spend months patching back and forth before they just give up and move on to the next game.   
---
There is a fundamental flaw with how energy (and heavy weapons) are handled in this game and they do require a much more significant overhaul than these small tweaks. This is also not a new issue, these weapons weren't particularly competitive in Fallout 4, either. 
---
That might be the case I don‚Äôt quite remember. 
---
Nobody is saying it's perfect. They're saying this recent update did a whole lot more good than bad.
---
Threads like this is why I love this sub
---
wedge shaped floor spaces would be great too. and didn't the bugs for building you. I've gone back to building in conan since it works and has more variety. I'm sad though, I want it to be fixed and be better here in fo76.
---
There's a stash box in Whitesprings bunker!! : )
---
I think so. Unable to play at the moment so I have been reading this sub all day. I do recall someone mentioning a similar problem and that was the issue. I also haven't seen any other posts about your particular problem either, so it's not a system wide bug. I would search this sub, lots of posted fixes for mod interference.
---
somone lunched a nuke at fissure prim on xbox an hour to two back, i was to late, the SBQ was gone..
---
Legit traders are the ones taking hits here. The dupe market that makes enough off one purchase to buy 2 new accounts (read: 5 new characters and 8250 lbs of carry weight) isn't affected whatsoever.
---
But this sub really doesn't care for legitimate traders. We're supposed to be the NPCs now, but we can fuck right off if we do it well enough that others can skip some of the unnecessary grinding.
---
Thanks guys. I read the patch notes prior to this post. The website I check failed to mention the content drip.
---
If that's important to you then you either profit from Bethesda or need to find something substantial in your life.
---
I somehow got signed automatically out of my ps4 while doing the Appalachia Quest. Which resulted in starting the quest over. I reset my password just incase it was something else
---
No thanks, i like seeing where im going 
---
Lol yeah I remember that. That was a crazy time since the dude kept chasing us around to each workshop we stole. Also I stole all his vegetables and water.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I was surprised, too. It also didn't have any legendary loot. 
---

---
Oooooooh! C‚Äômere Ermintrude, it‚Äôs milkin‚Äô time! üêÑ üêÆ 
---
:(
---
That makes no sense.  They are totally separate things.  One is a mutation.  One is a legendary weapon prefix.
---
Because the lore was never built to support an ongoing series. Not even Bethesda's additions.
---
Haters gonna hate I guess ü§ó
---
Radium rifle crafting service is a thing. People pay caps for it on the market
---
I wouldn't mind those respawn restrictions in the regular game mode, to be honest. Death could use a little more teeth.
---
Interesting that the "Wanted" mechanic is still in, but if it means you still get Wanted for killing someone who doesn't fight back, that would be an interesting way to address snipers trying to one-shot players.
---
Update your mods. Disable Better Inventory until it‚Äôs updated. The file names changed, update your custom.ini 
---
Thats most likely a mod conflict, same thing happened in Fallout 4
---
Also PS4 and we had a SBQ nuke this evening after patch.
---
Thanks. I'm known as sleepy4792.
---
Except this game is in no way ever advertised as an MMO. Plus the fact that they warned you multiple times that it would NOT be like traditional fallout.
---
So much ignorance for a "loyal" fan.
---
Wait. Why can‚Äôt we launch nukes? 
---
Post
---
so happy to read this and hope it's fixed!!
---
Thanks for the try. I'm known as sleepy4792. üòÅ
---
People have commented that this is due to having a custom ini. I would like to know the cause as I use a custom ini (gfx issues), but do not use mods.
---
Cryos are in an awkward spot. They don't have the option to directly increase their range like the flamer and using the Crystallizing Barrel is frankly pretty wonky.
---
The projectile can hit itself mid air and cancel out a shot. It can hit a target and not deal damage. And a myriad of other strange bugs and eyebrow raising weirdness. That being said I love the Crystallizing Barrel due to it adding the ballistic damage and being projectile based.
---
Yeah, that'd be nice. But...unlikely. I don't really understand why we get charged as is. It's not like we're taking some imaginary train. 
---
Yeah, family share makes it so xbox players get unlimited stash space AFAIK
---
This is a terrible post. 
---
And by gum it put them on the map!
---
Some glitch in the timer is setting it so it's 187 hours between launches. 
---
I think its just for display
---
Not officially, but even if they updated the game I doubt it would get the playerbase back, it peaked at 489 players in the last 24 hours
---
Lol try a Two-Shot LMG. I've never seen more bullets in my life. The recoil is a monster to deal with.
---
If you die you lose rads, if you die a few times you can get rid of most of it.
---
I doubt that‚Äôs what the wanted status will be or else half the map will be wanted. It‚Äôs probably still gonna have to do with camp destruction, but we‚Äôll see. 
---
Oof
---
Wait they increased the budget with this update?  I didnt see that.  I might actually spend some time designing my base now that I can build more than a shack.
---
I‚Äôm guessing they can‚Äôt fix the speed launch bug so the time reset on launching was put in place? Who knows.
---
That would be such a game changer
---
Like man, sometimes I count how many notes I play and divide that by how much money I‚Äôm making. And let me tell you brother, I am working cheap. 
---
Saw a nuke launch about an hour ago on PC, maybe just a display glitch?
---
I was just thinking this yesterday - it would give you key points to travel around the map as staging points to other areas
---
right? :)
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been really bad for the first few minutes but other than that has seemed pretty normal for me, I‚Äôm on XB1
---
You do need the "science master" perk to mods itq
---
My rig is decent. My client even in the queen fight only drops to around 50ish. They do something with the server FPS that does have an impact on the RoF of the Gatling gun at least. It has something to do with the physics engine being tied to server FPS. 
---
Nope, solo. It's not the first time it's happened, but it was pretty fresh in my mind. Had just had all my rads wiped at the bu ker, no diseases, but I did have a pre patch 6 adrenal mutation. I add that only because of just how screwy bethbugs are.
---
I remember in the stress test they were a hell of a lot darker, literally could not see without your light. Wish they added that back
---
Can't wait for your info dump!
---
After discovering ..of course
---
Yeah, we need this especially when they removed the trick to put plants on edges of the carpets. I want all my plants indoor with a lock on them.
---
489 of the most dedicated people out there lol. Props to them if they're having a good time and yeah theyd have to do something really extreme to get people back. Anything shy of taking the game down and giving it a hard relaunch I doubt would cut it. 
---
Didn‚Äôt know an actual recipe existed! Thanks for the link!
---
Mocking FUDUS
---
Probably this tbh
---
I (and many other) are...  
---
It's hard to be a vendor if you can't built a stock, and many others have voiced this same complaint.. 
---
Player Vending is coming, and what's the point if we can't actually have things for people to browse?
---
I'm having the same problems. Trying to re-install right now. I noticed that the uninstall didn't delete the Fallout 76 folder in the My Games folder, so I manually deleted the folder before starting the re-install. Will keep you posted.
---
It's a punishment for prior offenses, if you got a timer your account launched a nuke without completing all 4 of the launch stages before completing the death from above quest. But yeah  milk is op, also hopefully I can use my purified water in booze as well at some time in the future.
---
About a four minute walk north of VTU. Pretty convenient. üòÅ
---
Nice. :)

Did they do away with the campfire trick? 
---
Put me at the tightrope walk.
---
Every MMO from the Dawn of online MMO's have had them, check the Wiki Article, it's a staple of Online gaming, and should honestly be taken into account..  
---
To say nothing of people trying to build stocks of items for "Player vending"..  
---
With the Struggle we all have with Stash space how exactly is someone supposed to build a stockpile to sell if they don't keep it somewhere other than their main?
---
Fired up the game for the first time after the patch and the game crashed on the loading screen lmao
---
Me too
---
I may be in the minority here, but... it's a survival game right? I get that it's not condusive to our own playstyle, but I think part of what makes an apocolypse game great is freedom. There's no law to stop them, if we wanna stop that, we would have to gang up and get em'. Idk, just seems like whiney to complain about people trying to kill people in a game where we routinely slaughter hoards of super mutant for the same reason that they are.. because we can. Not trying to be inflammatory, I get why people would be upset, but that's my point of view at least
---
While I claim BoS affiliation currently, I am not part of a larger group. And yes, I am on PC.
---
Just be aware that every time something is fixed, another 30 things are broken for a while.
---
For example, for whatever reason, the game just mass-duplicates Power Armor Pieces in my inventory and sends me well over 1000lbs, then refuses to let me drop anything and destroys half my items in the process.
---
Never happened before. Welcome to Fallout. 
---
I feel like they're using this game as QA and balance for future games
---
Don't know if it's dropping but I snagged one from the Enclave equipment vendor
---
Absolutely was sold as a MMO....  
---
Multi-Player Fallout with unlimited Servers, but caps per server.  
---
  
---
No ignorance here, show me where they said it wasn't a Multi-Player Online game with a massive (originally Cross Platform) player base.
---
there are perks for it
---
I just sent you a friend request. Ill be back online tomorrow now. Let me know what all you want and i can get it all ready.
---
DAMN!
---
Officially...
---
There very well could have been some unofficially released to Appalachia (due to the plant in close proximity) or perhaps an inside man in regards to the college. College students seem to always get their hands on this type of stuff.
---
See you in Appalachia!
---
Bird bones and scaly skin.
---
Thanks
---
That's because one of the OG Call of Duty montagers of way back when is now working for Beth making trailers! Operator Perry is a pretty creative dude. Quuaaaaaaaad
---
There's a shit ton near b &amp; g station, I don't know if they've always been there.
---
Arktos Pharma is where the scorched plague was made I think. Cool. Hope to learn more!
---
I'll come log on for a few minutes 
---
How do we know it‚Äôs vault 65? 
---
I‚Äôve read the location had mesh issues before, maybe this was removed before release and (accidentally? ) added back in now. 
---
Just got home. What the fuck is rest mode for if it doesnt d/l my patch while im gone? Fuck i thought id come home to a fresh update
---
Now i need to wait for a 20 GB download
---
Fuck
---
You call 4 extra damage "on par"?
---
&gt;murder your dog

#DIO!!!!
---
Out of curiosity will the silo holotape tell you before entering the silo or this is instant upon key card being inserted 
---
Lol what system do you play on you‚Äôre amazing 
---
Okay I'm at White springs
---
It's referenced to as Vault 65 in the files. [https://imgur.com/gpx72eU](https://imgur.com/gpx72eU)
---
my camps right across the river and I haven't found the key yet either.
---
Already did that, plus removing Better Inventory from the list.
---
He lurks in the shadows. Is he a hero? A menace? Some say he's not real.. whatever he is.. he is.. THE ASS-ASSIN
---
If I put my brahmin indoors with astroturf and place a jukebox next to it, will it product better quality milk?
---
I don‚Äôt get how this effects duper‚Äôs that much, they dupe expensive items, with 1500 lbs they could still dupe 100‚Äôs of legendary weapons and armor. Idk just seems like another blanket fix that doesn‚Äôt really solve the problem. 
---
Looks like it 
---
I just had one happen to me about an hour ago. Was doing some challenges and collecting flora to craft the new liquors and I got disconnected. Logged back in and everytbing I collected over the past 10 minutes or so was gone and one of my connected challenges was back to incomplete. On xbox also.
---
I'm seeing Gutsys spawn from the pods if you kill enough of the locals, as well. Between those two changes, Watoga farming may be a thing of the past, I guess.
---
&gt;Mutants in da Wasteland Vol. 1
---
I changed the name of the picture to that.
---
I'd say it's different from what you said because when you kill the super mutants, you arent ruining someone else's experience.
---
And I'm totally fine with pvp, I think it's a great part of this game but when you attack someone and then they don't attack back and then you chase them through the map, it's annoying. If you find someone that wants to pvp you that's great but only if they want to.
---
Also it's not cool to camp vendors. That's just douchey.
---
What you mean legitimately? I got them a long time ago when I first started playing and have kept em the whole time.
---
I noticed several new bushes of firecracker berries not far from the Whitesprings bunker service entrance. Near the garage by the road
---
It's the little things man... I have Marsupial so any light tap of the jump button sends me shooting waaayyy over where I want to go. 
---
You should post in the market subreddits you‚Äôll probably have better luck
---
Appropriate typo in Title.
---
I literally was just saying they seem like they‚Äôre WAY more bright and all over where I was exploring. Thought it was just me lol. 
---
I woke up to an endless loading screen :(  Hope the quest resets so I can try it again
---
Lol.  Irony strikes a critical blow!
---
Me too, but now I kinda feel like I have nothing left to do...
---
Oh this is so good! I must have that sheepsquatch outfit!!!!
---
Nice haha
---
Killed 3 stars legendary and they dropped 1 star item (wood armor), crap...
---
Dang, where are you at with acid and a lake?
---
Met him today but it was after doing the Scorchbeast tango with a 80, 65 and 50. All was going well until I hit the Glass Caverns then I got half way and the server disconnected. It happened twice I hope this isn‚Äôt a new feature! BTE tried the lemonade and bought the recipes look forward to creating some.
---
If I ‚Äòmember correctly, there‚Äôs one a bit down the road from the mining company that you get the excavator armor from.
---
for some reason drill and syringer are stoll considered legendary. They removed flare gun from legendary table a couple patches ago.
---
1.5k
---
Right. Spent 15 minutes and a ton of ammo and explosives and got nothing. Not even a wooden spoon. 
---
it does damn near the same damage as a 50cal, has more than double the fire rate and more than double the accuracy... it's just got a smaller drum magazine, and really expensive ammo.... yeah, it's a PVP monster for a heavy weapon.
---
Looks like bear skull
---
You have to wait 30 minutes to get new mutations. Or you can server hop 
---
-_- I‚Äôm dumb, I‚Äôll see myself out lol
---
someone was claiming they got the Knight from the tech doc turnin
---
Maybe the bodies flying everywhere part but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they made a change to them exploding immediately when killed, if it was an intentional change though it should have been in patch notes, no one likes a sneak change but not being in the patch notes probably makes it a bug.
---
Wait, they didn't wait for you to complete the quest before killing you to get your quest reward?
---
I respect that opinion, I just feel that engrained (spelling) in the heart of the apocolypse fantasy is danger, and our ability to adapt or overpower that danger. In some cases, the opposition will be too powerful, and they may even spring a trap like that. We may get pleasure out of the positive aspects of the game, but playing the villain can be fun too. I don't think they're intentionally ruining the hame, rather playing the role that they find appealing the same way that pacifists or economists or c.a.m.p. builders do. Unfortunately, you're right, sometimes that role (in this specific example) can create challenges and even hardships. But, to me, when an apocolypse game stops presenting new apocolyptic challenges, even player - made ones, what's the point of the apocolypse fantasy? And to me, an ambush at the train station seems like a quintessential apocolypse move! I know not everybody feels that way, but I just figured that maybe I could try and broaden people's opinions on how some view the game. Thank you for your response, I appreciate the opposition.
---
i wonder what happens to the loot when they die. can someone else pick it up? would kind of defeat the purpose of all this. at least for the junk items i mean.
---
Another reply by someone who clearly didn't even read the comment (hint: if he's been playing since day 1, you can't claim he's still in any kind of honeymoon phase)
---
If you are on PC, fix or disable your mods.
---
Have the vendor bot on you?
---
What system are you using?
---
If you're on PS4, I can give you some toxic goo that'll do the trick. 
---
I cant get 
---
 mutated 
---
Such a blatant f you to melee players? That doesn‚Äôt seem logical.
---
Yes ps4
---
Same here, almost exactly. The one that blew up was a 3*
---
Mine are ok
---
If you are on PC update or disable your mods.
---
! 
---
Ruff is the noise a dog makes
---
Rough is when something is uneven
---
double fire rate? Guess I'm doing a sleep over in Lucky Hole Mine for the extra .308
---
Do you have starched genes equipped?
---
I farm legendary Watoga robots daily. Every legendary robot will explode about ten seconds (maybe slightly longer) after death, and it can kill you even in good armor. I always melee them and then just run away. You can still loot after the explosion. If you are already out of range when the timer runs out, they may not explode at all.
---
It had been this way for at least a few weeks that I've noticed.
---
ok good i was about to have to re asses everything if there was encounters i had missed before , i thought i had found them all and all tamable creatures, so hopefully new tames have been added as well
---
, no starch jeans is not equipped
---
About the report button, what is considered harassment? I don't do PvP but if someone is chasing me down or griefs me I'll be angry but oh well. No reason to report them, just go about your day and rebuild or join another server.
---
You're soooooooo kind providing for "them".  Thanks the gods for you.  And you explained so well the exact location too for us.... lesser people? 
---
Agreed!
---
I knew those mountains had more in them
---
Good luck finding one, buster. 
---
Can no longer have a camp adjacent to the Moonshiners Shack.  So much work.  Ah well.
---
Just one of many things I'm learning after 500+ hours. Another is that you have to hit Y to "search" things. That one hurt...
---
A couple different excavator paint jobs... and ultracite too. Wowza, miracles never do cease! Lol
---
It's not gonna be "in the code".
---
Not just you. They definitely stick out a lot more.
---
Yes, it is important to me that the video game industry improved because I like video games and when the industry improve so do the games.
---
So yes I do profit from Bethesda...we all profit from Bethesda...and every other game company that has made a product that you have ever enjoyed playing.
---
Was just about to say my roommate was in a server on PS4 not an hour ago that had two dropped on the Prime site. 
---
If you did anything that modify strings you will need to update strings. Like component view , etc.
---
Yeah get ready for all the haters, honestly tho can anyone say it‚Äôs alright not to get a customer service response for a product you paid for? That‚Äôs just bad business practice doesn‚Äôt matter what the reasoning behind it is. If you don‚Äôt get a response soon I‚Äôd look into contacting the Better Business Bureau and send a copy to BGS, or whoever handles the customer service complaints, and they‚Äôll probably get back to you pretty quick. 
---
Regardless of what you did you deserve an explanation and if what you‚Äôre saying is true I hope you get one soon. 
---
Starch jeans is not an apparel...
---
Please tell me more
---
PM for recruitment details if you're interested. 
---
i was JUST saying this same thing. they‚Äôre super bright and all over the place where i was running around. thought it was just me so im glad other people notice it too lol. 
---
‚ÄúProtectrons now correctly take damage over time when they have been set on fire due to damage over time.‚Äù That is the only combat change to them I saw so it definitely seems to be a bug.
---
I got knight earlier.
---
Made sure to scour my computer for anything related to Fallout or Bethesda. Got rid of everything. Now, downloading the game entirely fresh overnight (gotta love that 2 mb/s down connection). Good luck to ya, friend! Here‚Äôs hoping that‚Äôll fix it for ya!
---
On the bright side, not getting every closed door immediately slammed back in my face after I open it anymore...
---
When you craft a fermenter, do you have to repair it every time you use it?
---
Now I know why I couldn't find any toxic goo in WesTek Research!
---
 Did you obscure the number, or is it not put in yet? 
---
Sure it wasn't the suit?
---
I milked moo moo and it made Grahm disappear. 
---
Stupid autocorrect when using voice text
---
I think it all goes into the bag, and I guess people could fish from it? But it's hugely inefficient to have to drop all your shit at once - you'll have to leave most of it behind.
---
Actually a very nice patron arrived in my server and made me the sign so my nukashine could be tasted by all
---
I can make you any power armor part at max durability for any level, including the T-51b left arm you want. IGN: jchamlin
---
Myself and many other people just simply don't pick locks or hack terminals anymore. Which is sad because I am always afraid of not getting good lore, but changing my perk cards to be able to hack a computer to find "control turrets" option is the most annoying thing in the game. 
---
I couldn't tell you the last skill 1 or higher computer I hacked.
---
It's a huge change. Damage is nearly on par with the 50cal, fire rate is almost double, accuracy is more than double.
---
Wait, is your 159 your fire rate now? Hmmm, I didn't realize the legendary +25% fire rate actually changed the infobox for the gun. Mine has a fire rate of \~205
---
The only weakness now is the cost of crafting ammo for it...
---
Worth it to keep people from taking my lead, water, foods, and keeping ol bessie alive. 
---
Positive
---
But yet there are people still playing from day 1. So you contradict yourself. You can call me a ‚Äúfanboy‚Äù all you want. I listened to all the reviews and stayed away from the game for months because of them. I only got the game because I got a used copy at GameStop 75% off when I got a new controller. I paid like $25 for it and I‚Äôm so glad I decided to. I have encountered no issues. So yeah, the game *may have* been bad, but it isn‚Äôt anymore. It‚Äôs not my fault you refuse to play the game and give it a fair go again after all the patches. That‚Äôs on you my guy. Don‚Äôt condescend me because you‚Äôre opinion is different than mine. Who do you think you are?
---
Am I unlucky that, day after day whilst building my CAMP, I get ganged up on by a lvl 20, 84, and 212?
---
UwU
---
Haha, it happens
---
Nice, but that looks more like a barn than a greenhouse.
---
Honestly most trolls left early on. The bounty system works pretty well but still has a few kinks. Remember one thing though. When you‚Äôre that powerful top player, remember the kindness of the power armored gods. 
---
OP relish in your 'too easily pleased' feeling.  I have standards for full priced products but I'm apparently a minority.  I enjoy the game, sometimes a lot, but my initial experiences painted me with an overall sour negative view of the game.  If it wasn't called Fallout I'd have probably uninstalled it.
---
Your joy shouldn't be interrupted because another dislikes the product.  If YOU enjoy it, then you should relish in that, don't seek reasons not to enjoy something, that's how you end up miserable like me.
---
Uninstalled all of my mods and still no dice. I honestly have no idea what could be causing this, thanks for the suggestion though.
---
I'm glad I saved some heavies. Thanks for giving it a go and letting us know.
---
Nukashine's a hell of a drug.
---
The texture for that part does not appear to be in the game yet, so it shows up as a purple mass. 
---
I've almost never gotten an addiction before (like 1, back in november/december). I got an alcohol addiction doing today's daily... of drinking 25 alcoholic drinks. There might be a stacking % chance based on how recently you partook? Or I just have funny luck.
---
I didn't know Grahm is lactose intolerant!
---
Yea super bright. When I farming for them for crit drink I could hardly see them before. They used to be colored like cranberry now they are florescent red. Glad they made this tweak so much easier now lol
---
They were already previously available as a very rare outfit reward for Events
---
Yep
---
yes by fetilizer and there are bunch of them in flatwoods. press e to milk while hovering them
---
No, they have not.
---
They are still looking into it...

They seem to take ages to play music after turned on (tubes warming up, Bethesda?) and they spawn shut off (when your camp spawns as you log in). Other than that I am enjoying having Appalachia Radio at both ends of my camp.

After the heat death of the universe, long after all usable energy is spent. After all the hydrogen has fused into helium, and helium into carbon.
---
After the universe began to expand faster than light could cross it, and the observable universe shrank to the remans of the local cluster.
---
After the last civilization, around the last red dwarf has died. When nothing lives, and the universe ceased to know it exists.
---
After the last ship had run out of fuel, and the last breath was taken.
---
After everything.
---
There will be a rock. And on that rock, the last sound will be made, but never heard.

"Would you like some free lemonade?"

I'm in a similar spot, had a similar notification in spite of reloggin several times. Finally went and moved my camp.... to essentially the same spot, as far as I can tell. Had to rebuild the whole damn building too, "object is floating" messages on my Blueprint.
---
Haven't tried logging back in since I rebuilt it, though...
---
Help me out here, is all of this available now? Or rolling out in the next few weeks?
---
Had the game freeze this morning. Had to reboot as nothing would allow me to close the game. Had this happen once before a while back. So there are stability issues. Hope I don't encounter any more tonight.
---
As it turns out, the +25% fire rate legendary affects the listed fire rate in the infobox. For some reason I assumed it didn't. Baseline fire rate is like 160.... still quite a bit higher than the 50cal.
---
BTW, *peeks at your quest list* did you just leave the vault today?
---
Lol
---
Where is this?
---
.... I literally just found one vendor'd to Watogabot. Bought it. Don't plan on using it, as I'm a bloodied HW user and already have most HW bloody variants... but I might sell it!
---
fun fun fun...  
---
BTW Anyone else notice the WhiteSprings Stealth Nerf?
---
you can use good with salt card in luck. it helps me a lot
---
Anyone else Notice the WhiteSprings Stealth nerfs?
---
Yep, learned this the hard way, also don't shoot them unless you are a couple of bus lengths away. Also learned that the hard way. 
---
Any amount of cheese!
---
I am thinking that this is using a similar setup that the eventual "display" feature will use.
---
The Fermenter will actually show all the booze in your Stash as selectable.  But you flag up to 10 that are actually being used by the Fermenter.
---
I believe that this will be the way the future updated Display cases/racks will work.  It will show all items in your Stash that can be used on that particular display, and let you toggle them on/off.
---
Right after the release things were pretty good here, toxic af in r/fallout. It was the couple of months with no communication that really started to breed the negativity. Great to be back to the honeymoon
---
I'm so Friggen salty about this hidden update. I had been trying to sell this damn bloodied LMG for so long, but no one wanted it! I had it for Friggen months. I was so happy to pick it up when it dropped. It was my first bloodied 3* I picked up. 
---
Now a buff they didn't advertise hits and its a great gun.... Wish I didn't give up on it last week and sell it to the whitesprings vendor.....
---
Damn it Bethesda!
---
White springs was severely nerfed . Go farm elsewhere unless your dropping a nuke you get crappy crappy drops there.
---
Thank you for the information 
---
We ran into 2 tonight. I'd like to know how they were able to 1 shot us when no one shot/hit back. 10 minutes of spawn in, one shot, lose caps, repeat. They were camping the new quest locations. 
---
Awesome!!!!
---
 Well, here it is, just as I suspected, built in to the new patch to discourage muleing. 
---
* **Carry Weight Limit:** A new ‚ÄúDestroy‚Äù option will now appear in place of the ‚ÄúDrop‚Äù option when a player who has exceeded the absolute maximum weight limit of 1,500 pounds plus the character‚Äôs current carry weight views items in their inventory.
---
* Selecting this option will destroy the selected item. This can be repeated with additional items until the player‚Äôs total weight meets or falls below the absolute limit.
---
* While above the absolute weight limit, items can no longer be dropped, traded, or consumed. They can only be kept or destroyed.
---
* **Dev Note:** As part of our ongoing quest to improve the game‚Äôs overall economy, **performance**, and address items created as a result of exploit abuse, we‚Äôve decided to implement a ‚ÄúDestroy‚Äù option for players who have surpassed the absolute weight limit. This should also help reduce cases of excessive item hoarding, as well as prevent duped items from being dropped and making their way into unsuspecting players‚Äô hands.
---
I'm relatively low-level and had some bugs during the Basic Training mission tonight. It took me *so* many tries to get the challenges to register correctly.
---
But having a blast still. After playing Anthem, FO76 isn't bad at all. 
---
Not a fan as I outlined here.    
---
[Bethesda please be kind to the Vet MMO player's and reconsider the "Carry Weight Limit" change... (Aka Destruction Cap)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ugwd/bethesda_please_be_kind_to_the_vet_mmo_players/)
---
The problem with the way they've handled it is you can, with perks and reduction gear, carry about 32,000 pound GROSS, and be under the cap, but not everyone has the time to level a bunch of Alt's to store stuff..  
---
Two things I noticed. There is a definate lag between killing a legendary mob and the legendary item appearing. I'm talking at least 4-5 seconds after I loot everything else off the body.
---
Tried on multiple servers, multiple places. 
---
I'm on pc if that helps, but I did in one instance get a 150% repaired sledgehammer and no legendary loot off a 2* today as well so... 
---
The usual 7 Days to Die tier patch release. Fix a few things, all's good.  Add new content, suddenly a whole bunch of new issues crop up.  Did they play test for more than 60 minutes?  Who knows! Maybe they play tested for an entire day!  Or not!
---
Either way it is becoming 7 Days to Die all over again.
---
The nature of coding is one of trial and error, guess to save on costs we the p(l)ayers perform the trial and error for them.
---
I would legitimately work 16 hour days play testing this game at (hell maybe even below) minimum wage to help iron out many MANY bugs in this game and low quality areas.
---
But no.  Y'all gotta suffer through new bugs every single new update...
---
More details please.
---
True, unfortunately as its not a steam game I can't just do a file integrity check to fix that.
---
You don't enjoy having Grafton Dam Key (8) in your inventory? or Poseidon Hazmat Storage Key (24)?
---
Where at ? 
---
And some of them are terrible too. I cringe and immediately turn off my radio as soon as that ‚Äúa good man is hard to find‚Äù song comes on.
---
Oh man, that would be unreal, it just teleports you into Fallout 4 or New Vegas üòÇ
---
I am aware that's the way it was until now but Patch 7 has turned that into an instant (and imho more robust) explosion. Hence the PSA.
---
If you don't believe me go ninja one with a combat knife and see how that goes.
---
Exactly, and generally the dupers had inventories in the Hundreds of Thousands if not Millions of pounds...  
---
Not 5k, or 10k...
---
Dude I got a new 1tb HDD and have been downloading everything I had, this update today, my console finished downloading it FOUR HOURS AGO, IT'S AT BLOODY 52% COPYING BEFORE IT INSTALLS
---
I'M
---
LITERALLY
---
GOING MAD
---
Especially since my entire PlayStation is nigh unusable because it's become so slow, I might seriously just put the old 500gb HDD back in because this is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Nukashine is included in the base brewing you get with the Fermenter and Brewer.
---
I noticed that too. Sor Rad
---
Works fine
---
A rocky outcropping with a strange picnic laid out, with some skeletons arranged around a decayed pumpkin, I think, a short hike west of the BoS fort that you take technical data to.
---
Vault 65 according to the recent datamine
---
I've seen him idle at the Pumpkin House, not sure of the duration, roughly 10 to 15 minutes. He didn't move again until I interacted with him.
---
Hmm, I just killed several legendary robots with a power fist tonight, and I got the usual delayed explosion.
---
Ugh, that's no fun.
---
Like it'll suck but I'll get over it if I run into them in the wild but to camp quest locations, especially new ones is so dumb.
---
All because they wanna ruin other people's games or they're too lazy to get caps or junk themselves.
---
its like to scrapping logs for wood. random numbers from every brahmin
---
They turn into cobalt flux, too! 
---
awwww yissss, bethsoft finally deliver!
---
It‚Äôs a cool trailer and all, but why are they making the fallout series so wacky and cartoonish?! 
---
#makefalloutdarkagain
---
yep it's 100% better now.
---
Then how the F couldn‚Äôt they put a god damn texture in it! Just left it purple! It even had a name. Ugg! 
---
the problem is you can have (Gross) about 32,000 pounds if you have the perks and weight reduction gear, so the 1,500 hard cap is insane IMHO...   
---
If you didn't have the time to power level mule characters and gear them up, you basically got screwed
---
I had six of these types gang up on my camp and destroy it.  They were all in the 100+ level range, and one already had a Fasnacht mask. I‚Äôm level 46 and was alone on the server.  I should have left it sooner, but I just felt so angry and powerless.  I never had any issue like this until rejoining the game today, but today griefers were everywhere‚Äî all of them over level 100
---
But what if you end up moving?
---
My gatling plasma was just an ordinary non-legendary one until I stumbled across a (I think this is the right name) Suppressor's GP. The one that claims to reduce 20% of the enemy's attack? Haven't had a chance to try it yet. Somebody nuke fissure prime when I'm on. :)
---
^^yeah ^^I ^^know ^^I ^^could ^^nuke ^^it ^^myself
---
Not what they were fixing. Drills and stringers are part of the legendary loot pool. They're essentially the booby prize I guess. The problem they were addressing was more likely when a legendary enemy just has a non legendary loot pool, often seen in my experience with the spontaneous green glowing legendaries. 
---
You start the quest by going to any train station and looking on the notice board inside. You'll find a poster in there advertising the party. That's when the mission to unlock the plans starts. 
---
That sounds like a pathing issue. This sounds like a new thing... Esp w/ that new lemonade stand bot by Watoga. Now I wonder if the Charleston rescuer bot has a home away from home.
---
Yep, they did. I'm glad I got to use the carpet trick before the patch &amp; have my garden in my house.

"C.A.M.P. Placement Adjustments: Occasionally, new game content may need to occupy a space in the world that was previously usable as a C.A.M.P. location. When this occurs, a new no-build zone will be placed in that spot, preventing players from building there in the future.
---
If a player‚Äôs pre-existing C.A.M.P. location would overlap a new no-build zone on joining a world, a notification will now inform them that their C.A.M.P. cannot be placed, and they will be given one free C.A.M.P. placement."
---
This is bugged.  I logged in, got my free camp placement.  Placed my camp, relogged, got my camp knocked out again.  And again the next time.  If I can't build a camp there, stop letting me build a camp there!
---
This is the first official multiplayer Fallout, the previous games were all designed for single player and there are definite growing pains as Fallout 76 finds itself. Some of the things that work good for single player do not work for multiplayer, especially if they want to promote competitive PVP.
---
I don't think game mechanic suggestions are off the table, more than anything the developers want to find a working model for a multiplayer Fallout game. Major changes that do not work with the game engine would be another story.
---
Parkor!
---
Maybe not.  There is one watch tower with planter boxes on every landing, and a note about the couple's garden, so maybe will will get planters some day.
---
What if that drill was a legendary to the mutant and that's why he dropped it instead of actual legendary loot?
---
Could see a super mutant coddling a power drill cause it makes 'em feel better.
---
The worst part (I'm beating a dead horse here) is pre-weight reduction perks you can carry about 32,000 pounds GROSS, with armor and perks that easily falls below 1,500...  
---
Aka it's not about weight.
---
So if you have alts leveled with armor, you're golden, otherwise screwed...    
---
Doesn't hurt the dupers, cripples the people trying to become merchants..
---
The flack this game garnered,  it definitely earned.  It had a super rough start, as someone who quit playing a few weeks in because there were just too many problems to deal with I can appreciate how far its already come after playing the first time today since.  It had it's fair share of issues, and still does.. coupled with the collectors edition shenanigans and the jacket and such.    
---
It's possible to like the game and admit it's faults you know.  The game is far from perfect.  Bring on the "haters b hatin" comments,  but thats not whats happening.  Enjoying a game that has problems, and voicing concerns about said problems is totally fine,  it's ok to take off those rose colored glasses every once in awhile
---
Dying for a red or pink uniform.  I'll find one one day instead of 6 brown uniforms in a row...
---
We nuked that area before the patch to farm flux.  Saw the high level ghouls then.
---
Thank you for repeating what I said.
---
Buff drinklots

Along the road east of the Nuka Cola terminal. Just a simple non-player shack with sale signs on it and a bridge to access it. Figured it was for Grahm or brewing content
---
Xbox here.. Real choppy and skipping since patch 
---
What platform? This has definitely not been my experience on PC and after over 200 levels you could say that I've, probably, seen it all. :)
---
Eh you still get good drops 
---
Got a 3* anti armor LMG like an hour ago 
---
True!! I didn't even think about that! Thanks! üòÅ 
---
I haven't had people really mess with my camp as others have mentioned quite often, but I also kinda live off the beaten path. Apparently, according to the patch notes, now using the contractor perk will reduce the cost of repairing your camp as well.
---
Southeast of Top of the World. There's a small lake we with a row boat and an acid deposit near the middle of the lake.

Last time I took a workshop (as a level 15) it was the converted mutinitions factory and then some asshat level 87 kills me and like it was right after everything was working smoothly (turrets active, resource gathering and of course ammunition being made) now I understand the whole point of workshops *is* pvp but I didnt even stand a chance dude one shot me and I lost all of it, also I did sue for peace but he wasn't into that so RIP me I guess. I also never saw him coming like he didnt even appear on the map cause I wanted to know if someone was trying to do that (take the factory).
---
Over-Repairing an item shows immediately now, you don‚Äôt have to select another item and return. 
---
Fun fact:  the Diseased Prefix overwrites the Legendary Prefix, so if you ever find a diseased enemy with legendary loot, they were a "Legendary Diseased" enemy, with Diseased overwriting Legendary in the name.  So always check those diseased enemies, might find a starry surprise on them.

She (my main, Bertha)  is 28. Her parents died in the vault. She was victimized by many men throughout her life. The sexism in the vaults was rampant. When she finally left, she vowed to make a life for herself. To kill when she needed to kill, bit never more than she had to. When she got out of the vault, she would use her femininity to charm the other, experienced wastelanders. She would flash her heart emote, wear cute outfits, and the men would gift her things like water and food and stimpaks and radaway. Eventually one of these men gave her a plan to make a very rare and expensive item. She took his generosity, and left for good. She built herself a home, made it entirely defensible, and began her life as a hat-shark. She found a supplier, using a superhuman machine called a "smart phone" to find suppliers for cloth. She sneaks around the wasteland, an invisible speed demon cloaked in a mysterious garb. She doesn't need armor, she's a ghost. 
---
After making her own living, she eventually used her powers of charisma and seduction to employ four men (my mule accounts). These men were ugly, and overweight. They were her puddy. She gave them plans and materials, funded from her own savings. These men would travel around for her, trading her goods for caps. They would face the dangers she was too smart to confront. And she took back every single cap. No one would ever take anything from her again. To keep them under her thumb, she sleeps with the ugly mules.... all four of them. But she's always on top. 
---
She lives, to this day, in a remote part of the wilderness, in a beatific sect of the wasteland. Her home, a militarized barn, finally reached its fourth story over the top of the cliff during her third month of business. Since the expansion of her business and her life, she looks out the windows every day, and every night, from inside the house that she built, beside the fire she made, sipping carrot soup and listening to the radio and always..locking..her doors. She is safe. She owns Virginia. 
---
They added white russians to the game.
---
Regular rum is fresh rum
---
Yes and no. They didn't increase it but instead reduced the cost of a bunch of things effectively giving us more budget. Will post a pic soon
---
Why would you need to aim with a Gatling Plasma machine gun?
---
I won't be re installing the game just yet. I do believe this game has potential, and given time it can become a great game. For me to start playing, there needs to be more updates and content additions. 
---
That was where I ended up as well.
---
Yes it is!!! Access your photo gallery ingame from the map&gt;menu. There will be a button to set any photo in your gallery as your profile picture, and it doesn't have to be an ID card! 
---
Substantial things being added are survival mode on the 26th, new cryptid quests on April 9th, and the Pioneer Scouts quests and backpack on May 7th.
---
Something new will be added each week, although much of it is not a massive addition. 
---
It could be that Russian troll farm was having an all staff meeting so they‚Äôll be back. 
---
I feels more like it's working correctly.  My only worry, is that now, for a brief second, it shows 90+% chance to hit on obscured targets when you first enter vats.  Better that than having it completely broken though.  Over all the game feels much more playable ( and i've enjoyed it from the start).
---
Building wad always my endgame of fo4, why would this be so different? Also endgame hasn't come yet. They just added another secret vault to the map today. Lots of content to come.
---
I built a full floor, expanded my second floor, built a perimeter, added turrets and built a garden with this update. 
---
For it not being a increase to budget it sure increased my budget.
---
PS4, and yeah it seems everyday people pull up on me with a lvl 20 smashing me with a .38 pistol, trying to lure me to attack him, Until a lvl 100+ jumps out and insta kills me with like a switch blade
---
How much you paying? I need caps
---
Fermenter at camp allows ten items at once , the one in the quest explodes for lore purposes, read the note 
---
because it probably wasn't meant to be added to the game
---
I have plans to modify my sneak build in a similar fashion. It was my "prototype" character so he's kinda of a jack-of-all-trades build currently.
---
Im currently on vacation but I return the 21st, just in time for the festival. Add me if you'd like to run around and shoot stuff when I revisit Appalachia!
---
Eyy OP, screw these guys who are trying to make you think your entire problem is on your end.
---
Albeit the LOOKUP FAILED is an issue on your end due to mods you have installed, the inability to Aim Down Sights is a confirmed bug that has occurred in this patch on Bethesda's end.
---
Make sure to remove basically most if not all mods before a new update as chances are highly likely that they'll be out of date, won't work properly, and will interfere with your gameplay.
---
is there a limit because finding grahm and rapidly milking his cow then selling it all to him to clear his 200 caps wouldnt be too bad
---
You obtain it from the same Robobrain (Biv), it‚Äôs just finicky.  Spam the interaction button until he acknowledges you.  I had to server hop to start it.
---
Zing! 
---
if you had a little patience you would go through the secret entrance to the Whitesprings  Resort and go to Artisans Corner.... pleb
---
About to go to bed but I'm going to have to check this out right now.
---
I killed two legendaries side by side, in a group of three protections, in Watoga, from about 50 feet away, I‚Äôm a HW user.
---
No explosions at all. 
---
Shut up about the nuke glitch. It doesnt exist
---
Too bad cryolator didn't receive the same amount of love
---
Vague posting is vague.
---
This is a must, they should put it expecially on the player vs player trade too.
---
Oooo can I join? (I am only level 15 trying to get moar ammo for my hunting rifle and adhesive)
---
This is so freaking awesome and funny. I haven't gotten the pleasure of experiencing the new patch yet, but reading these sort of stories is hilarious!! 
---
Works great

[https://perado.imgur.com/all](https://perado.imgur.com/all)   \-- my new base. In the main post i added more pictures including the new vault

Got this at frat house today no cap 
---
Just added pictures for additional effect
---
Can't nuke after patch.  Tried twice today and when I get done with launch prep the keycard machine says " time until restored, 261 hours" . Tried in two different servers.   Waste of ammo.  
---
Whiffle Bat gangü§ò
---
yeah i got this on pc seems like it can happen sometimes 
---
It's not part of the simulation. Please refrain from further investigation.
---
I‚Äôve always avoided mines because they usually explode long after the enemy has walked past.  Maybe robots will be the one use for them. 
---
It's underneath Arktos Pharma
---
Yeah, there seems to be a bug that gives this message erroneously sometimes, even when the place your base is at isn't actually restricted. 
---
Typical.
---
Just got this too. Spent 120 caps trying to move my camp but kept getting the same error 
---
Where is the nuke cola terminal?
---
I've got one of those...good thing I've been saving up .308 for a few weeks, because it's about to get messy
---
Your custom ini. Either disable it or update it.
---
Yeah, they only buffed the durability by 2x for that. They should have done 20x, then the laser rifle would be on par with other guns
---
Was reading a curious post earlier. Dude leveled up his mules and took weight reducing perks as well as wore gear that reduced the weight of certain items too. Guy said he walks with excess of 20k lbs but it only counts as about 600-700lbs due to extreme weight management. If I can find the post again I will link it, it was a good read. 
---
As the days go by....
---
Next to a tightrope in the savage divide

FBI: delete this now.

I had an tuff teym spilling and frogot who two spill som wrods.
---
Thank you very much for the kind words. They are very appreciated! 
---
I guess cooldown will take 11 and a half days now? Wow that's alot father than the 3 hours it used to be lol.  
---
Except no one has launched a nuke yet in either servers.  
---
There is a bread of true dire hard fo76 fans in this game. I agree and get its not what everyone wanted, me included. That said, i am still super happy and can't wait for vaults.
---
This is helpful. I thought it was glitched. 
---
Not on ps4 sorry.  I finda circuit of watoga, whitesprings, harpers ferry to be a good way to grind xp, plus the legendaries don't hurt for legendary gear grind.
---
Worked, THANK YOU!!
---
I had even switched computers from the one I had been playing on which had mods, copied all my other saved games over to this new computer which included that custom.ini file.
---
You made my evening!
---
Anyone on ps4 can help?
---
Omg wut
---
You lucky bum....
---
Can you please test if you can blueprint plant-on-rug and place said blueprint elsewhere????! 
---
Same happens to me as well. I'm not a berserker build. Im running bloody at the moment. A friend noticed the change so we ran some tests. Bloody and non bloody. The special stats and damage reduced drastically when putting on the power armor to the point you ould be better off without the PA. Not sure what was causing this. We even swapped perks around and changed armors. 
---
Where is this watoga lemonade bot you speak of ?
---
Literally my best friend in Skyrim
---
I'd say pvp with the LMG pve with the 50 cal. since they're just sponges anyways not a good use of ammo
---
Upvote for occasional, situational darkness
---
I have the same problem at Solomon's Pond.  Built it 3 times before I finally figured out it was gone forever.  (Crashed once so thought there was still a chance)   Very frustrating.  If I can't use a spot, don't let me rebuild there!
---
Didn't get the names of the other two who were jamming! It was a lot of fun :)
---
Have you launched a nuke recently?
---
Sometimes you have to be radiated too almost death. Try letting that red bar go as far as possible without dying. And before you use radaway to get rid of them make sure you are not mutated. 
---
I read the note, I just haven‚Äôt made the fermenter at my camp. I just assumed the fermenter would explode for balancing reasons. If the nukashine sells for a lot I would have just assumed the fermenter would either have to be rebuilt or repaired so you can‚Äôt just craft 100 of them and sells them
---
I only saw one problem, it was that you could walk through the wall directly between the nuka cola door and the couch.
---
Yes just yesterday.  I do everyday 
---
Np. Enjoy your evening!
---
The fix has been listed, assuming you are on PC. Scroll Hot.
---
2 games crashes 5 minutes apart in one day. Did you break the game again Bethesda? 
---
You must be on pc.
---
I still had screen freeze twice tonight and a couple times I thought it was gonna bug out but came around. I really don't notice a difference other than my weapons are better and AR seems to work again. I did find that my power armor is weaker than my regular armor though and the PA reduces my special stats drastically. 
---

And even without any perks and abusing drugs and alcohol like I've completely surrendered to my demons I rarely get addicted to them. I'm stocked up on addictol, like twelve and perhaps counting. 
---
Maybe I'm just lucky but for me there is no downside to using drugs or alcohol. I fucking love drugs and alcohol.
---
Would it really give duper‚Äôs that much of an advantage to give the community a heads up on something like this? It doesn‚Äôt effect me but I know a lot of traders who did get hit decently hard. 
---
I get they‚Äôre trying to combat duper‚Äôs but if they don‚Äôt actually fix the duping exploits then anything else they do is pretty mute. Just seems like another stealth nerf imo. 
---
Yeah. Im done with this game after losing my adhesive farm across from site alpha

They were always there, just hard to see before.
---
And the enemies will still vanish after killing them. Not as often but it still happens. 
---
Did they?! I haven't seen them yet! I need those stats on it
---
I'm experiencing this error as well, hopefully a solution presents itself.
---
For real though!! It should have been a part of player trading from the get-go. 
---
He won‚Äôt get banned 
---
So.. you engaged in pvp by taking a workshop, lost, and are now trying to get the winner banned? Good thing the new reporting system is managed by humans.. at least one Bethesda employee will get a laugh out if this.
---
r/fo76
---
Yeah, plus energy weapons have a decent fire rate so it could be better than it looks.
---
Firecracker whiskey was mentioned in the brewing update too!
---
yeah finally! only saw it now thanks bethesda
---
I actually really appreciate this change.  I afk often (mostly cause I have two spaz-attack kittens who still need to learn NOT TO KNOCK PRICELESS ITALIAN ANTIQUES ONTO THE FLOOR) so it's pretty cool that I can sit in Watoga Station afking for a bit longer.  Sometimes I really like what server I'm on and don't want to lose it.
---
And so it begins...that took longer than I thought. 
---
What outfits have been removed besides the recent atomic sale items? Were Piper's trench and Cait's corset removed too?
---
It was worth buying months ago. I can't stop playing. My wife hates it so I guess it depends on your situation at home. As for worth, well I don't do much anymore but play this damn game. 
---
Sexy
---
Delete the mods and remove the archives section in your custom ini, the rest could stay.
---
 It happened for me too, I used some custom map, better inventory, icontags, some custom pahud. Didn't check which one was causing it, so I nuked all the mods I was using.
---
It's ballistic, look at the symbols next to the damage value. Bullseye for ballistic, lightning for energy.
---
im always down to play, trying to hit 100 for the trophy, PSN: m00n5br0
---
40 mins is enough time imo. If you are going to be gone longer you should just log out...  Most online games have much less afk timers just to keep servers from becoming parking lots.   GTA is 15 minutes idle and only 2-3 minutes if alt-tabbed.  In Star Trek Online if you afk for more than 5 minutes you actually get penalized with the loss of rewards in many open free roam event situations.    
---
Getting 30+ minutes to literally do nothing and keep your slot on the server is very generous.   
---
personally i just log out if I know I'll be gone more than 5 minutes since it only takes a minute to log back in, and my camp is in an area that very rarely has someone in my spot. 
---
I saw a lvl200ish guy stuck at site charlie for a long time on PS4, then left without launch. Silo status was ‚Äúready to launch‚Äù. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs same problem.
---
I think there are more steps than that. You have to change or delete the ini files in your documents folder... Stuff like that. Unless of course you tried that... 
---
Yeah, the dude was harassing me and 4 players under level 30. So I am pretty sure they won't take lightly on a guy one shoting players.
---
Been playing since Jan. Loved it then and love it now. Yeah, there were times I was frustrated but I knew what I was dealing with. 
---
Thank you. Do you know how I can uninstall the mods?? I legit forgot how I even installed them. All I used was better inventory. Any help is much appreciated. 
---
Sick dude. I'll add you some point tomorrow.
---
Funny, he was using the exploit to do PvP, and harass me and 4 players under level 30. 
---
But you keep telling yourself that.
---
Thanks dude! Will take into consideration.
---
I had this happen to me with a 3 star legendary Mr. Handy in Berkeley. Killed him, he exploded and went flying.  I'm lucky I even found the body.
---
Great work guys! I'm going back to Appalachia because of this update!
---
One cool feature I have noticed is Challenge Tracking, great idea! but can we please have the option to hide it for instance if I do not wish to utilize this feature or if I'm trying to view things on my map. 
---
Keep up the great work! 
---
Could this mean we might be getting another journal of the adventures of Shia and Turtle?
---
I dont understand how your base was that big to start with.  I have 9 floor pieces, 12 half walls, 4 sets of the metal stairs, 1 of each crafting station, 2 door walls, and 2 generators and water purifiers.  No defenses and no lights because my budget is pretty much maxed.  Cant even afford a roof which is why I built way up in the air.
---
I had to delete a bit less than 1000 pounds of items today on my main mule. 30 or so min-nukes, 100ish missiles, 30 weapons, all the lower level power armor sets that I had been saving for leveling up alts, and a ton of junk aluminum, steel, and other stuff. All received legitimately from my multiple level 50 playghroughs and transferred to my alt account. 
---
I am annoyed. I mean, none of it was all that valuable, but I have earned that stuff, and to have to toss it without warning sucks. I even had extra space in my chest, but it wouldn't even let me put any of it in there. 
---
So yes, legitimate players got caught in this, and it's kind of lame.
---
No problem. Hope it helps.
---
Yeah who needs 2250 seconds to do stuff anyways.  I mean 1800 seconds was enough for the most part, what could an extra 450 seconds possibly do for anyone? /s
---
3 crashes in 15 minutes
---
Awesome dude! I have the same issue. My character has perk cards in evey type of damage, so he isn't a power house at anything, and minor crafting and endurence perks so he's useless.  I'm also on vacation till tomorrow so I'll add you then.
---
Except it isn't a recent bug.  It's an old bug that they took their sweet time in fixing and then they brought it back when they rolled back the code accidentally a month ago or so along with bad stealth behavior that has been there since day one.  My point is that sure some are mistaken or easily misled, but that doesn't take away from the real bugs that are there.  Looks like they fixed the always caution again, but that one with team mate fighting means your location is known to the mob no matter what is still pretty bad. Mobs shouldn't be able to see you unless they are looking at you and even then only if you don't have a successful stealth or chameleon effect for example.
---
There's a number of areas like that, which I feel are almost certainly being left more or less "blank" for future development. The woods surrounding the vault at the far south of the Savage Divide is conspicuously empty as well, for what I suspect are similar reasons. Possibly also the woods to the southeast of Thunder Mountain. 
---
Is a bug, the devs are aware and looking into it and it should be an easy fix that can be rolled out without taking the servers down.
---
It would seem that there is already an unofficial 'fix' via mod if you are on PC but I have not had a chance to test it yet myself.
---
Depending on your stance on mods you can check:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148
---
No they have always exploded. Kinda why i love em
---
Exactly. 
---
This has never been a feature for trading with players, ever. It should be, but it wasn't secretly removed. It probably was never a feature with vendors either. It should be, but I'm not sure it ever was.
---
The ammo factory on the north is good to farm but be prepared to fight with other players sometimes. 
---
Same, well only mildly impacted, but that's true because I invested an insane amount of time making sure I was prepared..  
---
For this kind of Nerf?   
---
I don't see how... But I can't speak for the planning behind it.  
---
Damn, you taught them well I see...
---
That sounds like a smart move to me, honestly. I have no problem with them keeping their secrets until they're ready to officially be a part of the game. 
---
I hope this post goes all the way. It would be very good for bethesda reps on here to see it.
---
If you find yellow maybe we can work something out. 
---
OP, why choose to be miserable?  Can't we just enjoy *the little things?*
---
Yeah idk what the deal is but it sucks bad.  Nukes are the only thing keeping me playing on a daily bases now 
---
Another player indicated that the new signs take up 5% budget each. Do you have that much free?
---
So you want someone to get banned for playing the game. He doesn't need to exploit anything to one shoot you.  I hope you dont get political power in rl
---
The bug of the vault-tec skinned weapon bench randomly spinning around is still in the game. For several months now.
---
Usually going back to the mod site where you got the mod, and following the instructions, but do things in reverse. Like delete the mod file in your data directory, revert the changes in your custom ini file, or they have specific uninstall instructions, which is basicly telling you the same thing but more specific.
---
Word to the wise... Definitely don't build one of those turret camps behind the golf course. I can guarantee someone will mess it up. And yes., The patch did not fix this as I seen it on several servers tonight and wrecked them all. 
---
I think it might be related to the display cases, that will show off stuff - like the bubble heads and magazines. Just a theory, as they said it's coming.
---
Someone should really make a compilation of all the little mess ups they've made with this game.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone cares about what kind of music other people find ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù. Seriously, you play fallout but you don‚Äôt like ‚Äúold music‚Äù? It‚Äôs pretty much a major feature of the game. 
---
Pretty sure that was locked 
---
I try to use very ammo savvy weapons to avoid having to farm altogether. Gatling gun, and Flechettes harpoon all the way.
---
But if you need .308 (45 is a a bit harder to find), farm the early scorched. They use a variety of ammo, .308 being prettt common
---
Do you want a pic of the axe that he sent me?
---
He took our plant at 12:03am and harassed us well till past 12:40am but you go ahead and keep telling me how using a 2145 dmg axe isn't an exploit, I gotta see this.
---
Gather up lead from the gyms in Flatwoods and Charleston Fire Department. Can get 200+ lead a day, server hop if you can‚Äôt find the weight plates. Farm Supermutant areas for steel from their weapons and gunpowder drops. Take scrapper perk for scrapping weapons and take both Ammosmith ranks. Also when you get the refined .50 mod for hunting rifle switch to it. It‚Äôs one less damage than the top .308 and you can make 180 bullets a pop for far less materials with ammosmith 2.
---
Are you dense or just lying for kicks?
---
Just logged back in to check and yes I am experiencing the same
---
They'll refer you to the message you get when you take a workshop that says doing so flags you for pvp. One shotting is very doable in a variety of ways and is a part of the game; it's not an exploit. My question is: how many times did you and your friends pull a Pickett's charge and keep running to your deaths for 4 lvl 30s to lose 1.5k in caps?
---
So it is new then, if they updated it, they forgot to update the computer to give us a hint where to find the key
---
I've been there since launch but I haven't played it religiously. I still have fun with the game. Maybe you should try playing something else as well and have a life outside games. I mean with work and sleep I don't have a lot of time to play. I haven't had to deal with as many bugs as the people who play constantly. If you don't like the game give it up and stop giving people shit for liking it. It not your style of game but stop trying to convince people it's a bad game because it's not your cup of tea. 
---
In the Aaronholt farm a brewing station was added to their barn as well (the large one, not the one with the power armor inside it)
---
Then I won't need em
---
Got it, ill try that now! thank you!
---
I mean, yeah, The guy does sound like an absolute twat but he wasn't doing anything to get a ban.
---
Try 52 Trapper's notes and 38 Gourmand's Notes.
---
Sincerely, a guy who tried to get rid of those notes without any luck for several weeks.  I imagine over 200 total spawned from me alone just trying to get rid of the dang things after realizing I had over a dozen of each in my stash.
---
Great thanks!
---
I hope so, I don't get why people who use the perk card system exploit are given a pass when they clearly are exploiting the game.
---
Don't understand why some people are supporting a dude at level 105 harassing level 30 players, but ok.
---
Bro you opened up yourself to pvp... and then got mad when someone engaged in pvp??? I‚Äôm sorry am I missing something?
---
thats why i placed my CAMP now on an acid mineral spot. Its near the new Vault that got patched in but still its number missing on it. In the northwest forest, east of that lumber company.
---
Perk card exploit? Whatcha mean?
---
While you're at it, make it so people who can't pay the caps can't damage workshops they don't own.
---
He was harassing us with a one shot weapon, he took all of our caps, and our resources.
---
But you can keep defending him, we will see what Bethesda does to 5 tickets about the guy, something tells me they won't like a player harassing lower levels, and taking 75% of their caps, but ok.
---
If anyone spots him (on PC) I'd love an invite if I'm online!
---
My damage stats on my bloody weapons increased drastically 
---
Over 1.5k from me, 1k from 3 of them, and around 800 from the other guy.
---
But that totally isn't an exploit, and we totally didn't just get cheated out of hard earned caps/components.
---
I try to keep a useful gun of each caliber and switch between them as ammo levels change.
---
Agreed
---
&gt; Where are they taking us?
---
the country roads ? They are taking you home.
---
Yeah Bethesda won't do anything. Have you tried calling the police? 
---
I've run into Rescuers Vendor Bot on the road leading up the mountain towards the relay tower near flatwoods, and I've seen it idle behind a bus in front of Gilman Lumber Mill.
---
That's kind of weird.
---
I just noticed this as well. This game gets more broken with each patch. So sad...
---
Have you tried not to be such a prick to a person helping his friends, one of which is learning disabled?
---
That's not very feasible for a low level.
---
I asked one guy to stream the rage on his face when he was destroying duped items and he didn't take to the suggestion kindly
---
Coming back to mention that yes, its through the daily quest as a random drop
---
Hmm I will check it out. 
---
I see them a lot in watoga high school
---
I noticed this today well. When Infirst logged in and was in Flatwoods, I could immediately tell something changed visually.
---
That's true. Did not though about him being a new player. 
---
The only reason I'm using these mods to begin with is because BGS doesn't know how to incorporate basic UI functionality like locking items so they can't be dropped, traded, or destroyed unintentionally and doesn't know how to design a UI that doesn't force users to scroll through long lists of unsorted items. So as a customer I can blame them and I will. 
---
He robbed us of components, and caps. But tell me more how that isn't game breaking, and against the whole "harassment" policy.
---
How was the orgy?
---
Finally fixed everything. I was using Cloudy's Mod Manager, and had to deselect all the checkboxes, then save the settings. Then I removed the exe from the FO76 folder, along with the Mod Manager ini file. I also had to remove two folders "Strings" and "Mod BAs" from my FO76 folder, as well as several .BA files. Basically I removed everything that didn't have today as the create date (since I re-installed). I also updated the Fallout76Custom.ini folder.
---
okie dokie babe xoxox 
---
Lol really? Idk man. Just hit cap a few hours ago and took this pick
---
Players can make one shot god build by using radicool, and some other perks to get their damage to over 1k and one shot players.
---
It is game breaking, and needs to be adressed.
---
They release on later on. I‚Äôm pretty the release date for backpacks are may 7th 
---
The B.E.T.A. was insanely dark at night on Xbox. That was probably too dark but I wouldn't mind something a little darker than what it's like now. 
---
I kill and collect. Use melee when possible. It adds up fast 
---
This annoyed me. Because I pick through others garbage they sell to merchants. How I found my 3 star chest pieces and some explosive stuff.
---
But now its a gamble. I just spent 400 caps on crap and can even sell it because the merchant only got 30 caps out of it
---
Loud... bright flashes...
---
Bat dicks everywhere 
---
Go to kanahawa nuka cola plant, theres plenty there.
---
i started using the tesla rifle 3 or 4 days ago. i recommend it. I have over 1000 ammo as I only used charging laser a few shots then went back to rifle. i use the rifle/sneak build. 
---
OH THANK GOD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
---
Sounds like you do the exploit, and don't want it to be addressed.
---
There's a roadmap with a brief description and a release date. Besides that there's not that much information on them.
---
Thanks what do you play on?
---
Yet I can still only get 200 caps per vendor a day so what's the point.
---
Ps4 i just did the nukashine quests
---
What harassment policy? The game literally allows you to kill another player, and take their junk. That is a mechanic in the game set by the developers, you could‚Äôve easily served hopped if you felt harassed as well. Sorry man but trying to get a player banned for playing the game is the real ass hat thing to do.
---
I'm on xbox
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know how to justify it in game other than plaguing the offender with a bad case of something like ‚ÄúIndebted‚Äù or ‚ÄúFinancial Depression‚Äù or something silly like that that has this as it‚Äôs symptom. The only way to recover is to earn enough caps to be worth as much as your wanted level. (Damage output to monsters and NPCs in solo gameplay wouldn‚Äôt change, however, to ensure that it remains easy to regain caps through regular grinding.)
---
Yea i got both but ps4 is my main

---
U wanna play
---
Not right now 
---
K
---
Guess the whole "Harassment" option under "Report Player" is just for looks huh?
---
I need to get a new mic thats why
---
hm... my bloody build with a supersledge can reach nearly 2000dmg on 9% health and im not an exploiter...
---
It's an incompatibility with the mod itself, not the game. Those without mods can inspect without problem.
---
This would make pa so op
---
Just went and checked it out. There's some decent scrap at the vault and if you follow the dirt road from it all the way south. 
---
Curiously it also looks like you can build here. CAMP shows green when I try to set it down...
---
So because something has never happened to you then that means that it never happens! 
---
That is a stupid comment just be lucky your not having to keep rebuilding your camp because a idiot has decided to smash all of it
---
Don't get me wrong, what happened to you sucks.. but it is a part of life in the wasteland and something that you opted to engage in and stay engaged in. 
---
By taking a workshop, you engaged in pvp. At any time you could have hopped servers, taken a 15 second stroll and saved yourself and your friends a bunch of grief.. a process which could have, once again, been avoided by not taking a workshop. Bethesda literally makes you stop to agree to the fact that by taking a workshop other players will be able to attack you.. such as another player hitting you in the face, once, with an axe.
---
It just effectively stopped trading in the game.
---
Yeah, i must do :O you idiot haha I'm as helpful as I can be to fellow players in this game. I even said the guy was a twat for griefing you. Just because i told you he won't get banned i'm obviously an exploiter! haha Jog on.
---
It‚Äôs about what you define as harassment, if he claimed the workshop and took your shit, and were getting one shotted the entire time, why would you keep going back??
---
There is like 3 huge tanks of it.. it's always there
---
They want peace for the fashnact (bad spelling?) festival. Nukes will go live again after.
---
M.M.O
---
That first M you're conveniently ignoring stands for MASSIVELY. As in thousands of players at once in a single server, not hundreds of servers with two dozen people. Day 1 they made it clear it was an online survival game with quests, PvE and the freedom to move between servers as you wished... At no point did they try to compare it to an MMO or make clear any intention to make it an MMO
---
yeah it was a rough lunch and a well earned flack, but I as well have been playing from day one. With that said I have seen my share off negative post. I was expecting to come in here today and be full off ppl telling us about the bugs and stuff but I would say I have seen very little complaints and mainly people been happy about the new content. 
---
lets hope bethesda keep up the good work rolling and best of all we can see that they are listening to the community feedback. 
---
 This thread went downhill in a hurry. 
---
I didn't opt in to lose 1.5k caps to a douchenozzle using a known exploit in PvP, and harassing level 30 players for half an hour.
---
We're about the same level as well, cheers mate. 
---
What platform? I can make you some if you're on PS4
---
Has anyone mentioned that the stash box incorrectly shows the weight of items as if they have the lower weight given to them by perks when being carried? It‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs filling up my stash box with the weights incorrectly shown as reduced.
---
If you think it is messed up, you wouldn't be trolling so hard to support such assholery.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
Agreed for the most part. Just like the missing reject button for trade request items (that might exsist but couldnt find it when someone kept hounding me for my prime snip)
---
Haven't they heard of a test server. Least that would give the illusion of customer support
---
Oh, let me see if I understood you correctly:
---
The 'vanilla' trading menu is working just fine and those experiencing the issue are people running an outdated version of this or another mod that edits that swf file?
---
The question may have been answered but the answer given doesn't solve the problem, at least not in my case.  I fixed the ini file, did Scan and Repair, even reinstalled the game.  I'm still falling through the ground every time I log in.  
---
Wait does this means that the longer you ferment the brew the better it is? Like if you ferment a beer for like 5 years its going to be super powerful? That sounds pretty freaking awesome.
---
Leave your gamertag I‚Äôll be sure to do the same. 
---
I bought a two shot explosive handmade from enclave armourer 
---
Define the word "exploit".
---
You could just.... Not use mods for an online game, you know. 
---
Only very few mods were bannable, and they are no longer on Nexus, so anything you get there is safe.
---
As for players being all high level, eh. Doesn't matter. I am still level 32, and I still see people below level 10 everyday. New players are joining the game everyday. Also, most high level players don't bother engaging with low levels, and many people are nice and will help you with materials or equipment.
---
Cause we wanted to keep our shit as we were close to getting our friend his Excavator Armor, and go back to doing quests.
---
He kept following us around the map, and taking our workshops, he was using a well known exploit to cheat in PvP.
---
I also spawned by a Deathclaws! ..didn‚Äôt survive though
---
As far as I understand, yes.
---
yes it was great, everything they did for the new DLC was rgeat on my opinion, definetly I wasnt expecting all the did. 
---
it gave me hope that they are trying to clean up the mess the lunch was and they are trying to bring back in players and I am sure they will bring some back. 
---
over all i can say it did surpass my expectations, after a few hours off playing I did not encounter any visual bugs and the game was running smooth for me on XBOX
---
Lol, are you trying to say you will harass me in game, wow, who hurt you my dude?
---
I know you can't upgrade T-51 to be Ultracite, I even explain why in my previous comment, but even you said the wiki says it's upgraded T-51, but I don't need a wiki to tell me that, just look at it, aside from the color it's the same as T-51 PA...
---
I ran across this fellow earlier tonight, a bit south of the Wavy Williards Water Park entrance.  But I don't think he gave me anything, nor could I successfully interact with him.  He just kept following me and asking me to stop.  But when I did and he was close, he just stood there.  May have some bugs, evidently.
---
Just another new "random encounter" for the random encounter locations.
---
I had a camp nearby too, if I recall correctly it's also pretty close to some kind of "proto-fissure" (big radioactive crack in the ground, but no Scorchbeast). 
---
Great. If I can have those I won't keep falling down every time I am coming down from the first floor of my camp.
---
troll
---
THIS. thank you. Hope these dudes fix their own game after "checking under the hood". But it is quite annoying seeing all of these posts because guy modded his game... 
---
You cannot be robbed of caps. In PVP you do lose caps when you're killed. It's part of the game. You also drop junk you are carrying. It's advisable to drop all junk into your stash often. So you don't lose it in PVP. Can't take the heat? Stay out of the workshops.
---
It's great to know that you're enjoying heavy weapons. Should you have any further concerns with them, please let us know so we can report to the dev team.
---
Have an awesome day :)
---
Ahhhhh c‚Äômon man,not the dogs!
---
Yep and no dice, I'm just reinstalling the game at this point. Hopefully that fixes it.
---
There are literally hundreds of these posts after every patch.
---
Hey. 
---
A lot of the issues wouldn't be fixed without the flak. 
---
Nothing good comes free. 
---
If you don't realize that, you're naive. You also are dishonest with those close to you and don't share honest opinions/don't respect people enough to be real with them. 
---
:). 
---
Also, it's not an MMO. 
---
Criticism isn't bad unless it's unnecessary. This game has acquired a lot of necessary criticism. 
---
Please, please, think before you speak aloud. Unless somebody is calling for the heads of a group of people/those people being fired/etc; they're probably being fair in their viewpoint and their criticism should be viewed with an objective lens, not a personal one.  
---
The devs get that, that's  why they have improved the game and listen to criticism.         So, the negativity has.............
---
.............improved the game. 
---
Please, think before you speak. Your post is naive and it does not consider the necessity of feedback. I am grateful for criticism in my field and I welcome it ALL THE TIME. If I'm wrong, I get to learn a better way to do things. 
---
It's not that obvipud if you don't follow fo76's news. The trailer don't state it, and for the roadmap, newcomers won't think to look at it
---
Are you talking about the Nuka Cola bottling factory near to Camden Park? 
---
Then your just quite stupid

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

---
What "exploit" was he using?  Sounds to me like he was claiming the shop. You took a workshop. You consented to PvP when you did so. It's on the popup telling you exactly that. 
---
If he milked caps from you, that sounds like you kept seeking revenge and losing and now you're upset about it. If they were in party or team exclusive chat, anything you said over area chat wouldn't be audible to them. Further, if you were in team chat, nothing you said would be audible to anyone outside your team. 
---
If someone kills you, you simply respawn. There is no glitch with perk cards with regards to Bloodied. It's a build. The reason he's able to do obscene amounts of damage is because he's at very low health. 
---
The berries look brighter and the leaves are darker
---
Sorry to go off topic here, but T_Ronix pointed out how crazy useful the cryonades/cryolater is for PVP scenarios and I'm curious if anyone you've come across has used it to any effective use. I'm still working on my own character for pvp, but have considered keeping an eye out for a nice cryolater legendary + stockpiling cryonades for the right moment.
---
My google-fu isn't returning anything. I'm curious if anyone else knows how to fix it?
---
These stories make me smile every damn time. Thank you for sharing :)
---
I was a very sad when I discovered that there were no inverted roof corners on my first camp build. I was convinced I was missing the plan or something because who makes outside corners but not inside corners? I was mistaken.
---
I don't think it's messed up. I just thought he was a dick a for bugging you guys. You should just blocked him and jumped servers and that would have been the end of it within 5 minutes.
---
Pls 
---
You didn't answer his question. How many times did you go back and try and retake the workshop from the high level player?
---
People are trying to explain the mechanics of the game to you but your getting angry and defensive.
---
I was losing 128+ each time, when I killed him it was like 37 caps steady.
---
How is that fair? He had little to no caps, and was able to take pretty much all mine, but stay at a low amount every time I killed him.
---
lmao FO76 was a rough but Anthem said hold my beer; i have tried to  play anthem but them loading times holy shit, 
---
If someone attacks me unprovoked, I would like them to become wanted. It's not just a battle royale, it's fo76 with pvp enabled. I'm more interested in playing the game with a little more risk and reward and tracking down bounties while I play than I am in running and gunning at every player like is a deathmatch 
---
My sheepsquatches were mole rats.  Very elusive.
---
- Mods are currently used at player's discretion. There is no official 'yay' or 'nay'.
---
- The way this game is so far coming back at level 20 is OK, starting fresh today is OK too. There exist no account exclusive, pretty much mandatory items that require level 'x' to equip and large alliances and months of grinding to acquire.
---
I think you only lose some aid items, not all aid items on death. 
---
they didn't fix that? damn, i just want to use skin i spent atoms for
---
Ah but speed demon has hunger and thirst +50% while moving now. Ehh the buff isnt really that great for that much. Maybe a 25% increase to hunger thirst. Shit doesnt turn you into The Flash ffs
---
They're also at 10% health. It's not an exploit, it's a trade off. Us bloodied builds are close to death but deal high damage. You do less damage, but you're also able to be at full health. 
---
We each had 2 workshops for over 3 hours, why should we be penalized for a asshat who was exploiting the perk card system.
---
How is it fair to allow a player to get 2145 damage from a melee weapon?
---
I really hope so. I love PA but it‚Äôs just so weak compared to normal armor. If everything was just base stats PA wins but at the cost of resources to maintain as well as fusion cores. But once you start factoring in legendary effects on standard armor it soon our weighs the low DR downside. Making PA inferior because the higher DR doesn‚Äôt matter with all the damage resistance perks available for only non PA. Especially in PVP. 
---
They've already stated you get to keep your character but I hope they reconsider
---
Next few weeks
---
I haven't played this game since the week that it came out because I was waiting for to fix a lot of bugs. Is it much better now?
---
[in robotic voice] Your. Mom.
---
I ended up in front of a tight rope going over a cliff
---
right on, daddy-o
---
Your level is much too low to think about scorch beast queen. You would do nothing to help, and just by being there you would make it harder for everyone else to kill her.
---
The game had a reaaaaaally rough go, but if Bethesda sticks with it I can see the game being great 
---
Theres a nuka cola vendor named Bubbles in the Whitesprings Resort on the upper level. They're in a corner and hard too find so check near the area that Tannin the bartender is.
---
Here's what Bethesda's reply will be:
---
Ignore the player causing you trouble using the ignore button death or simply block them for session, then switch servers. You'll not see them again. 
---
[Here's my favourite method for keeping myself flush with ammo, which I shared with someone else with a similar question the other day.

---
I just don't get how you think those who gave beth shit didn't care or aren't loyalists. If they didn't care they would have never said anything and moved on to the next game. Speaking up and getting something done is why this game has improved. If the bad reviews and lists of bugs and exploits didn't light a fire under bethsedas ass things would not have been put in motion.
---
Also nuka cola quantum is 75caps each and can sometimes be found at train station vendors.
---
You had control of a workshop that enables PVP! Expect that PvP in what ever form it manifests itself. If it gets too hot for you just block and bail. End of chat.
---
All good as long as your the big spoon.
---
Was it at fissure prime? I was at that event.
---
Yeah and he is using the radicool exploit, do you seriously think that shit is fair.
---
If so I am done with this fucking game and community, all I fucking do online is help other players, from dropping stimpaks for new players at vault 76 to giving my friends components, and not worrying about them paying me back (I tell them to pay it forward to other low level players) all I do is help people on here, and then when some asshat is harassing me and some friends who got the game a month ago, everyone is like.
---
"Well you were engaging in PvP, and it is in the game, so?"
---
All I hear is "Well the duping was in the game, and those two shot explosive shotguns are able to be dropped." 
---
This is bullshit, if this is how the community is, I might as well move on, and quit playing the game while trying to help my friends who have never played any Fallout game before.
---
obviously, and I guarantee they will come at some point in the game's life...
---
He was giving me the cold shoulder...
---
OOOOOOO and here I was thinking everything interesting had been found. Or maybe it was added with the new content. Either way, I can't wait for them to open those puppies up
---
Yeah, one of my biggest complaints about the game was that the building budget was so tiny you could not really build a base, not that there was a reason to other than cosmetics so I could kind of ignore it.  But it combined with the tiny stash made the game unplayable for me.
---
for the most part it is,
---
I have played 187 hours and I have only 2 times PVP it was fun the time it lasted. I am sure you will find that one a\*\*clown that will kill you for no reason. but for the most part i havent had anyproblems when I find someone roaming around.
---
I do the samething sometimes, I hunt down low level players so I can give them some goodies. I know it sucks for me for the first 15-20 lvls, so I like to help them start the game on the right foot.
---
I hope you enjoy the game, I know I do
---
It is an exploit bud, plain and simple. 
---
Radicool exploit?  It's a perk. It gives you extra strength the higher your rads. Bloodied melee guys run around at 80% rads to get the full +5 STR. 
---
You understand what I'm saying?  It's not an exploit. You keep acting like they're cheating but they're not. They literally have no health. If they did, they wouldn't do so much damage. 
---
Is there a way to uninstall mods that you know of? Rather not reinstall my entire game to delete it all.
---
I noticed this as well.  I didn't see any 3 stars at the vendors I visited, so it didn't really matter.  The secondary effect was listed where it's always been, I wonder if it would just list 2nd and 3rd without needing to inspect.
---
Well that is just LeL.
---
Botg reg2k and Keretus made it abundantly clear that an update was necessary and exhorted users to disable the mods until it was available.
---
Never mind hey, it would seem I understood this conundrum the wrong way around.
---
Thanks for the clarification. 
---
Are you still there, and is the Lemonade stand still there?
---
Right after the let‚Äôs say mediocre start of Fo76, I instantly thought and hoped for the No Man Sky Effect. this means that a game starts flawed with things like missing content or a multitude of bugs because of a rushed publishing date or missing experience of the developers. 
---
The game itself is, however steadily evolving and getting better and better because of constant updates that fix the problems or add content. This requires a team of active developers who actually care about the game and won‚Äôt just bury it and move on.
---
And how it‚Äôs looking for Fo76 this might just be the case,  as the roadmap and the small updates that rebalance and fix the game look promising.
---
It is an exploit dude, and he kept taking our workshops.
---
Don't get why you people are white knighting some random asshat.
---
It's also a question of what reaction you want players to have to the rewards in the game. 
---
What makes people happier? Being surprised by sometimes getting better loot than expected, or being surprised by sometimes getting some fricking loot at all? 
---
I can say it doesn't.  I wasnted coin on a lether 3 star crap. I was hoping it had weight reduction effect
---
And you seem to be a kid who hasn't been teach basic rules of dialogue
---
So you are telling me they aren't using the system in a way to get to one hit level damage.
---
Guess I should make a one bit build and see how far it gets me.
---
Good call! I was wondering about the presence of that building on the main title screen as well, and I think your intuition is on-point. It's one of those locations which is interesting in principle, but there's nothing which takes place there aside from occasional Horde events. I'll be very happy to see it fleshed out in near-future updates. 
---
Since you clearly don't understand the mechanics all that well, I'm guessing you'll die all the time trying desperately to make it work. 
---
No, he is right. If they have to sacrifice their health in order to achieve it, then it's not an exploit. Its simply a smart high risk high reward perk build.
---
Late bloomer. Not a bad thing. 
---
I think a content update like automatron for fallout 4 would work extremely well with 76. We could have our own little robot buddies. 
---
1. Some weapons wear out faster than others. However, there is a perk called Weapon Artisan that repair weapons to 200%
---
2. Weight has gotten better, when you manage it properly. Weight is dependent on YOU! If you pick up everything you see, you're ganna run out of room fast. My advice is to know what base you want to build - Wood, cement, whatever and collect that. Then build your base. Then collect everything as you or if needed.
---
3. Bethesda servers...You can leave back to the main menu and join a new server.
---
4. Nukes, as far as I know are the end game content. The rest will come out in DLCs which has started today with the Nuka Shine stuff.
---
5. When you go offline, your base goes with you. It disappears.
---
Use melee in the early game areas.  Stab scorched.  Pick up ammo.  Flatwoods, Sutton, Helevetia are all good places.  I had the same issue, wish I'd discovered the benefits of melee earlier.  
---
BECAUSE TAKING WORKSHOPS IS PART OF PvP...SO ITS PART OF THE GAME FFS. 
---
And once again you didnt answer the question.
---
So what your saying is if you take a workshop, no one else on the server is allowed to take it off you?
---
Let me break down your comment, because it confuses me:
---
 "Too mutch going on in large scale pvp to time that extra crit button imo in semi auto." 
---
\-&gt;Okay, I follow that it's annoying to time critical hits, especially when you're in the midst of PvP combat. It might even be easier if the VATS system assumed you wanted to execute a critical hit as often as possible, no?
---
"My experience in the game has been opposite, I do miss my insta crits, but have found full auto as my only option."
---
\-&gt;This actually makes no sense to me. Opposite of being bothered by the difficulty of timing critical hits is that you have to use full auto, and hold down the "Execute critical hit" button? Isn't using full auto just a situation in which you have to do this awkward hold-while-in-VATS maneuver?
---
"It takes getting used to to hold down the crit button. "
---
\-&gt;You mentioned that in every fallout game you've played, you've created a macro to effectively hold down the "Execute critical hit" button for you while you're in VATS. Isn't that something worth mentioning to the developers of the console based MMO RPG version of fallout? That "getting used to it" is not really worth it?
---
"As far a the jumping thing you have to monitor your action bar, there is plenty of stuff that increases action points and regen rates, that you dont seem to be taking into account."
---
\--&gt;Correct, I assume you have infinite AP, and benchmark the weapons against the damage resistance of the Scorchbeast Queen. It's not hard to have practically unlimited AP with the Cola Nut perk and a few Nuka Quantum up your sleeve.
---
"As far as I can tell your asking for two separate nerfs all so we dont have to push a button, I'll pass."
---
\-&gt;First, a nerf would be like reducing the damage of all two shot, explosive weapons by 150%, because that was clearly overpowering all other legendary perk combinations. Suggesting that we balance weapons across classes, by accounting for rate of fire when calculating critical hit frequency, is actually necessary to make PvP viable, and prevent everyone from buying a bloodied 50 cal MG. It's actually easy to boost the damage across the board to make PvE content easier, but much trickier to reduce the variance across the max DPS of various weapon classes.
---
\--&gt;Second, the first half of your post implies that it is a pain, that you've not liked having to hold down a special button to maximize your DPS (i.e. execute a critical hit as often as possible), and you foresee that it will be a bigger pain when PvP mode servers come out. Making it so critical hits trigger naturally does not nerf anyone, just makes the gameplay smoother when you're forced to use VATS, the aim-assist bot for this game.
---
Awww dude, unfriend him immediately and jump to a different server, there are plenty more ghouls in the wasteland.
---
It is an MMO pal
---
I at least am able to have enough brain cells to research a update properly before expecting something false
---
Hey there, I started from when the game first came out on beta but havent been on recently so some things may have changed but I'll answer to best of my ability.
---
Weapon durability - no they do not break over time. (Added fact, to get weapons mods you'll have to scrap weapons to receive mods for them. )
---
Weight limit- they're is a stash box that now holds 600-800 I believe?(could be wrong)  It use to be really small but they've increased it a couple times. A good rule of thumb is to not to be a horded on this game which is hard
---
Servers- as of right now are basically random and only hosted through Bethesda . though you can send an invite to your friends and they can join your world as long as their not to many people in it
---
End game. - now this one I'm not sure to much since I havent been on in a bit. But they do plan on making dlc and I guess that question I still up in the air and depends on your play style
---
Building protection - no one can damage your buildings unless you are online in a server. Once they do damge to your building they will become wanted and you can hit them with full strength.
---
Go to watoga station. If you follow the railroad tracks east you will see a few train cars. One of them has wooden ramps going up both sides. Inside is a skeleton and a bunch of boxes, on top of those boxes the plans have a good chance to spawn. I have found them there three times. Fastest way if you ask me.
---
The watoga vendors are spamming these for 300 caps
---
My bad you need to repair weapons I forgot about that
---
(Or Bloodbourne)
---
Yeah but with al the changes its fine now and will only improve. Those things were always temporary and they said that. Patience pays off with a game with free dlc and no sub fee.  
---
Cry snowflake 
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Yeah that's not good.  I'll still buy it if it's cheap enough, stash space be damned.  
---
Stop using auto fire weapons? Those are 2 I never even come close to running out of. 
---
What I am saying is if your gonna allow a one shot melee build to dominate PvP the game is not gonna go far. 
---
This has been a known issue.
---
I KNOW!!! I WAS TRYING TO PICK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!!!!  
---
good to know I was not the only one.
---
Principle though
---
More mystery, that's cool. 
---
Except it isn't the dude took over 4 hits from my 299 damage "All Rise" how the fuck is that fair?
---
Targeting a grenade with VATS and trying to shoot it with a Cryolator is still a great way close the game faster than going through the exit menu.
---
Go back to your dad, his dick is getting cold.
---
Can also confirm, walked past that area trying to get to the lumber mill by hugging the edge a few days ago
---
Where is that? 
---
i dont spec into any damage perks. so this is just adrenal reaction and the bloodied with the weapon. i might not have the right receiver either. i might not have been under 50% hp also. but in general the LMG is really nice. 
---
You don't understand what harrassment is. Harrassment is constantly following you around, attacking you, verbally abusing you, constantly finding you and your base and destroying it. Nobody would ever get banned for what your saying. It's a game mechanic, even destroying your base for no reason would not be griefy enough to get banned.
---
You can atleast take solace in the fact that most people taking advantage of the PvP system to attack lower players will be over on the survival servers when they start
---
Thanks for the lulz, needed it tonight. You guys are great at explaining game mechanics! I mean it! üòÅ 
---
So I decided to finally give this game a try. I created a character and activated the terminal in my room, and it was blank. I couldn't do anything.
---
I got my pipboy, and it is blank. I've rebooted and relaunched the game a whole bunch of times.
---
The pipboy has worked randomly once, but not the 7 or so other times I've tried.
---
This seems to be a massive game-breaking bug. I'm seeing reports of it at launch and in January. But has this bug still not been fixed?
---
Is there anything I can do? How can I play the game if I can't get to my pipboy?
---
West, away from the flooded train yard. Though there are 2 separate plan spawn points in the train yard, so look there as well
---
Oh no, i spend 2k atoms on some useless mothman merch before i stoped playing. I was so dumb.
---
I can't tell if your trolling me or not. One You suggested crits be dodged. And dps be reduced because its inconvenient to hold a button for full auto. Your post makes it seem like, full auto needs this. It does not, if you put your whole argument together and your ideas your asking for a huge decrease to ranged weapons. 
---
I have played some mmorpg's where you can afk permanently. Which allows you and guild mates to afk while doing  emotes. Its rather fun. I'd like to afk in Fallout 76 for dinner or if i go out, which may take 1-2 hours and come back to the same server where all my friend are. 
---
You wouldnt believe how hard it is to get 15+ people you know is the same server. 
---
What the f*** did you just bring on this cursed land
---
Lol derp, you‚Äôre correct. It‚Äôs supposed to be west. Thanks for the correction.
---
Was the big the Agility Training Part?
---
I only ask because I had a friend who swore black and blue the quest was "broken" and "unachievable" so I had him do it in front of me. Sure enough he hit all the buttons, but he didn't do any of the obstacles, he just ran around them all. 
---
I told him to do it as-if a drill sergeant was watching and he did every obstacle correctly and low and behind he got the "Quest Completed". 
---
He was angry, confused and amazed that it detected he was trying to cheat the test and it would fail him for it. 
---
Definitely new, I‚Äôve been up there a ton. There‚Äôs a birdwatching deck out there with some cool firefly lights that you don‚Äôt really see anywhere else in the game. Had a base next to it for awhile. Looks like they added more than we know, this time it‚Äôs a good thing :D
---
The whole canvas bag uproar was really petty though, it was a damn bag to fit what everyone cared about in it, the power armour helmet (pretty sure most people would've thrown the bag under their bed for an eternity regardless of the quality).
---
what system you play on?
---
I fell through the ground a little while ago but I don't use mods and I already updated, so I wonder if it's a glitch tied to other things too, aside from mods.
---
Also, swing north from there along the road and the semi trailer next to a watoga bot builder has camp plans that can spawn
---
Yeah laugh at a guy trying to help people out who are new to the game, guess that is one part of why this community died out.
---
No, that's completely untrue. I've also got the bug and I never did skips.
---
Make it an optional quest at the start of the game. People have to know! Not just kill brahmins, but also milk them!
---
There‚Äôs one of two things going on here-  
---
1. A really bad troll post.  
---
-or-  
---
2. A group of players who learned a lesson today.  
---
I‚Äôm leaning towards option 1 being true but in case it‚Äôs not I‚Äôll indulge you-  
---
1. When you claim a workshop you open yourself to PvP.  
---
2. By level 100 or so most competent players will have maxed out their builds and have access to good equipment.  
---
3. You can‚Äôt win every fight. If you‚Äôre outclassed it‚Äôs probably best to pack it up, I know it can be hard to let it go but holy shit letting some dude kill you 50 times before you give up is *excessive*.  
---
You guys learned a valuable lesson today. The wasteland can be unforgiving. Also, that guy isn‚Äôt getting banned.
---
Will we ever see the stairs be able to snap to the left/right side of the floor panels, instead of just the center, so we can also snap them to the small 1/4 size floors? PLEASE
---
I doubt that, seeing as everyone is claiming it as a mechanic, when duping was an uninteded mechanic also, and that got patched.
---
I hope one-shot bloodied builds get nerfed to at least two shot, cause I shouldn't have to hit a dude at 10% hp four times, and he can just one shot me.
---
I didnt glitch. No idea what the nuke glitch even is. Takes me 25 mins or so to clear the silo
---
After they put more bugs in patch 7 to fix
---
Yep i agree
---
‚ÄùCome get your lemonade here!‚Äù -Deezer
---
How bout this, don't allow one shot builds in PvP while it takes 4 shots from anyone else to kill them.
---
But keep riding that exploiters D all the way home.
---
Do a search next time.
---

---
No, I blame Bethesda. None of my other games do it this way. 
---
Exploit and not fair don't mean the same thing. 
---
Just because it's not fair doesn't mean it's an exploit.
---
It's still a trade off, either way.
---
Because new content just came out. 
---
Wait a week or two. 
---
I can't play right now from what they broke in patch 6 my secondary weapon becomes unequipped when getting in a fight or getting in or out of power and it doesn't matter if I had just seconds earlier put it on it's gone it happens every time they brake this game more with every patch I'll never buy another game of theirs ever
---
Oh wow you are saltier than beef jerky eh?
---
Well, are you a smurf? There is a camp limit of 5 radios.  
---
You may not know this but there is a relaxed FO76 subreddit as-well as this, /r/FO76FilthyCasuals  
---
It's mostly screenshots of cool bases, nice postcards and story's but it's very nice to be subbed of both :) 
---
In a cart on my way to Helgen  
---
One problem. The local cryptid in Lewisburg is bat boy from lost world, not sheepsquatch. I should know, I live there
---
The game has it's fair share of problems but it's still pretty entertaining, I only know it'll get better with time so I'll invest some time into it and enjoy it even more later. :)
---
Lol the whole quest was a let down for me personally. The real update here was the VATS fixes. No more whiffing because of a bug
---
I ran into someone pretending to be manta man, over 200, who hadn't done so. You're not alone. 
---
Found him with a wanted status at the bottom of a lake. Killing him was a rather entertaining challenge as he never got out of the water. 
---
I got level 9 spawns there and I‚Äôm over 100. Still blue screening. Events not working, like breach and clear.  I agree with you. It‚Äôs a wait and see.
---
Dude you keep changing your story and adding on shit to try and make yourself look okay, you never mentioned he kept following you around in the original post nor did you even mention he was ‚Äúconstantly taking components‚Äù even so, taking your components IS APART OF THE GAME.
---
So bats (which scorchbeasts evolved from) can only fly for 10 minutes at a time? 
---
Community didn‚Äôt die out just because we don‚Äôt agree with you for trying to get a player banned for no reason. How old are you seriously?
---
I love it. I only saw them once in the mire. Followed them up and down for a good 30 minutes.
---
If I remember correctly, level of durability from highest to lowest goes metal &gt; brick and warehouse &gt; barn and wood.
---
Usually when I see him, the vender bot is somewhere along the tracks 
---
You tried 
---
Go normal barrel, DPS is similar to a 50cal as far as I can tell, and fusion cores are a lot easier to come by compared to 50cal ammo!
---
My exploding gatling laser is literally a able to mow down mobs now, like you'd imagine a weapon like that doing.
---
Cleared a silo with it yesterday, only took off like 20% durability with normal barrels. 
---
A handmade will do over 20 damage per shot compared to energy weapons, as well as be easier to find ammunition for and will never have the problem of mobs becoming unlootable ash/plasma.
---
There isn't much incentive to use energy weapons at all.
---
Would be better if treated like a cargo bot enough bullets into its wings should force it to lose its ability to fly. But i found taking out the scourch around it makes it land 80% of the time
---
There's already some in the game similar to these. 
---
Have fun when the issue is adressed, and your build is not viable anymore.
---
Not really, he takes 4 hits to kill, but I take one at full health. Ok bud, totally not a exploit.
---
"These are not the exploits we need to fix."
---
Are single foundation bases/towers still preferred or viable? Haven't played in months. 
---
If you die, walk it off
---
Unfortunately I can't tell, as I have never modded 76 or 4. As far as I know, uninstall the mods from your mod manager, but if you modified any game file, a repair and scan may help restore them, although the best way to fix this is to reinstall.
---
Realistically functional???
---
A semi automatic laser rifle will deal 61 damage where a handmade will do fucking 80.
---
My regular handmade is eons better than my legendary laser rifle as the ammo is easier to find, mobs never disappear on me, and its an actual threat to mobs.
---
I do more damage with a regular lead pipe than I do with my modded burning legendary laser rifle.
---
*fart*
---
Is that so? I'll have to check then.
---
"bEinG aN aSsHaT iS pArT oF ThE gAmE!"
---
im with you, I would get it if i see it on the Atim shop it is so nice, loving the direction the game is going. I have been playing from day one and it is almost as if im playing a different game. 
---
keep the good work u/BethesdaGameStudios 
---
Are they rolling back their decision to allow standard mode characters or not?
---
I'm loving my two shot gatling laser now, BRLBRLBRLBRLBRL and the whole silo is dead 
---
You clearly cannot play the game my dude... maybe it‚Äôs just not for you?
---
Including my own stupid ass
---
After reading this thread, and seeing  OP‚Äôs inability to grasp simple concepts while also being a dick, I am actually starting to think what happened to this guy and his friends DIDN‚ÄôT suck. I kind of want to spend the next hour attacking him and his workshop. I don‚Äôt even PVP often. 
---
You should give back that degree
---
They pop up in the Giant tea pot event...
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a bit, but this is roughly where my camp is located. Am I fucked?
---
Doh, thanks for the link, I didn't do a search, I just manually checked the first dozen or so posts on  Hot and Recent and didn't see anything there.
---
Did I ask the r/fo76 subbreddit to help me get the guy banned?
---
Or did I bring up a touchy subject for the exploiters here to get pissed at me for mentioning?
---
The dude took 4 hits from a 299 dmg "All Rise" but can one shot me at 100% health, while he had 10% health.
---
Yeah, totally not unbalanced.
---
I'm still getting this, but tbf they didn't say they were fixing this in this patch. I remember seeing a CM's response to someone else saying they are aware of the problem and working on a fix.
---
Read the sub before you post the same thing that‚Äôs been posted a hundred times today. 
---
If you‚Äôre under level 30 I highly doubt you have a 299dmg all rise... lol
---
I had the game since launch, and have taken out over 15 scorchbeast queens, this is a game breaking exploit, and needs to be adressed.
---
But keep telling yourself otherwise.
---
Then how the fuck are you under level 30 and aren‚Äôt able to take out a high level character?
---
Yeah, this guy can‚Äôt be serious right? 
---
Can you make a screen of the exact spawn location?
---
Lmao he‚Äôs full of shit 
---
Be careful gents, I got my ass smacked with a feather from a nearly hatched chicken from fanboi's for poopin on their "FO76 is so majestic now, all hail Bethesda" thread.
---
I just want the bug that was supposedly fixed in the second or third patch where your team mates dont go invisible entering/exiting a building.  But my team mates can brew tonics invisible...
---
I never said I was under level 30, I am level 128, and this shit has been broken since launch.
---
It should have been addressed months ago, but assholes on the subbreddit keep claiming it as a mechanic, and not a flawed mechanic.
---
Perks like serendipity 3 and dodgy 3 and Barbarian 3 mitigate SO much damage. You need to chill man. 
---
True. I'm so tired of VATS Crits missing at the most inopportune times. 
---
Holy fuck, you are spare parts aren't you, I said my friends were under level 30. 
---
How the fuck do you not get that?
---
Reading Comprehension: 1
---
I built my CAMP right next to a building with one already outside, and my house is across the road from it, so I get free Nuka-Items when I log in now :) 
---
You can't milk them if you have the Plague Walker mutation, even if you have no diseases.
---
Git gud scrub
---
Just learnt something new, thanks man :)
---
Here to report the charging feature of the Salvaged Assaultron heads is doing nothing. When using charged shots in stealth, the damage occurs, reverts back, then applies only a single shots worth of damage. 
---
Hurry back to daddy, his dick is getting cold.
---
i would say dont let the youtubers stop from having fun, I enjoy the gave, fact is I have been from the get go, it was buggy and needed help, I can say that FO776 its in a hole different place, for the better. 
---
give it a try and if you have played other fallout games im sure you will have fun with FO76 as well, I sure do. 
---
Lol, I seem to have touched a nerve with you.
---
Guess you use the one-shot bloodied exploit build, and don't want to see it addressed.
---
First of all: No.
---
Also, Ghouls shouldn't exist, Supermutants are impossible, etc. so your post makes no sense.
---
Which one? I have five builds, bone of which are melee, and all of them are viable. Just give it a rest guy, you‚Äôre coming off as a crybaby or something.
---
Says the guy who let himself get dicked down by a better player then came to reddit to tell us all about it
---
Did I shit in your Cheerios ‚ÄúTazBaz‚Äù? Lmao
---
Uhhhh I'm not seeing that, chief. lol
---
Definitely some mod conflict. The perk works fine for me.
---
Anyone who uses that emoji after that phrase makes me cringe so hard they should be put in jail. Ew.
---
For bringing up a game breaking issue?
---
Yeah good luck bud.
---
Theres no spawn point, easiest way is to buy one from someone else or just keep killing legendaries until you get one as loot.
---
What console is this on? 
---
No problem mate. I run a melee build. Oops! Don't forget blocker 3!! Should be a part of any build to honest. 
---
Not a better player lol, he exploited the game so much that HE can one shot anyone, but other people can't do the same to him.
---
Not a better player at all, that is a exploiter, and I could drop him all day if he squared up like a normal player who doesn't use exploits.
---
Riiiight because you must be doing so much in between flipping patties and waking up in the afternoon 
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
Weapon switching works ok for me now. The compass markers thing is still there though, and I think it was there in Fallout 4 as well, so IDK when that'll be fixed.
---
Bruh wut
---
Find low level super mutants, they'll drop 308 for you
---
I was camped near the trains mentioned and was giving wetsuit plans out to everyone I met. Now I seem to get bos uniform plans there a lot. Still a great place to check. 
---
So let me get this straight... You think that because He's a higher level than you, has better gear than you and an optimized build that He's an exploiter? Nah mate. Exploits are using 150 bobble heads to do 1,500,000 damage. This guys just better than you
---
The same thing happened to me last night butttttt im not crying about it I respawned and killed 1 guy got killed 2 more times came back and killed the 2 people they took all my junk but its whatever life goes on.... so stop being a baby my kids cry less than this its unbecoming  
---
PC, but I'm thinking about maybe making a video on how to make it so a couple console players can make it.
---
For PvP a lot of the Anti-Armor perks, effects and mods make it moot as well. 
---
You should buy the game. Its always been fun and is only getting better
---
He was 23 levels below me, and was utilizing perk cards and a legendary to one shot me, while it took 4 hits from me with a 299 "All Rise".
---
That is a exploit.
---
No.  It is still stupidly buggy.
---
Also, don't be homophobic.
---
Hey me too!
---
Not crying, saying this shit needs to be adressed it is fucking up PvP, and ruining the game for lower levels.
---
Haven't played in a few months, reinstalled to check out the DLC.
---
Hit up my camp and start throwing down some extra lights, notice NUKA COLA everywhere, wot.
---
Yep, White Lights are causing it. GG
---
2h and unarmed? 
---
Sell it to him thats a lot for a cap outfits worth nothing lately
---
I don't know if they've said anything on that recently.
---
Yeah nothing says fuck your PA like 75 percent armor ignore. As of any amount of armor would stop over 2k worth of bloodied damage. But you know what can stop that regular trash armor with legendary prefixes and reduce all incoming damage before being factored into your damage resistance. What a joke. 
---
You can never be wrong can you?
---
You should work on that.
---
You think they should be banned for playing the game in a way you don't like? Yeah bro you abused the shit out of that reporting system.
---
Damn some people have mind to build
---
I actually thought about it but I need to go to bed. Checked there so many times the past two weeks I‚Äôm going to need to have a sale on ballistic fiber to clear stash space. 
---
Turns out if you go in right after someone else the bags will respawn for them even though you already picked them up. If they don‚Äôt grab them I do. 
---
It's a Windows related issue and mostly caused by outdated drivers. Hard to tell which drivers, though. Try disabling Windows Error Reporting service.
---
Have a good time now!
---
Get it.
---
I did this last patch. My mules are just high enough level to take weight reduction perks. I don't dupe, I just horde shit and have no intention of stopping. An aid/junk mule needs to be level 13. Weapons needs to be 50. Armor mule needs to be 14, or 51 if you want them to hold PA.
---
Shame we can‚Äôt access them yet. I like them better than the stairs currently available.
---
Lol wow you're an idiot. That's not at all what's happened. Stop spreading false info. I don't even know what the nuke glitch is and I have a timer
---
Omg, now I can remove just the right amount of rads for my unyielding/bloodied build!
---
The lower your reputation and expectations, the easier it is to impress. I'm starting to think the earlier buggy release was just really genius marketing strategy. The whole "all press is good press" type deal. I mean, hey, they did just hire thinkjam
---
&gt;peoples' mules will slowly but surely die of thirst, hunger or rads, drop their junk and won't be able to retrieve it.
---
You don't die of thirst or hunger. You just hang at 5% health. 
---
Wait hold on. I watched the video and you sold junk to the vendor?! Is this new?!
---
How am I wrong for asking an issue to be addressed?
---
I didn't name the asshat, I didn't demand people to report him on their end, all I did was say it is wrong for a build to be able to one shot me, when I have to hit him 4 times.
---
He has 10% health, and takes 4 hits to kill, I have 100% health, and take one hit to kill.
---
That isn't balanced at all, if it was 2-3 from either of us, I could see it being a workable mechanic, but it is literally the definition of a video game exploit to use the game systems mechanics in such a way to give one such an unfair advantage.
---
If it is legal, well I guess I will be making a one shot bloodied build, and doing the same as this ass clown, till it gets addressed, and fixed accordingly.
---
Till then, I am gonna play fair as I enjoy PvP being about who gets the best hits in, not who hits who first.
---
Where did it spawn? I‚Äôm on PS4 and want to find him. 
---
Congratulation on being the 1000000th post on this issue! It is related to mod conflicts. Delete your mods and ini and do a scan and repair to fix this issue.
---
These are new. I was just down here earlier this week and the basement has been rearranged. This must be something nobody's figured out yet. 
---
If they fixed stealth, you need to fight only in last part. So craft 30molotovs and you are ready to go.
---
I don't think you understand what a nerf means.
---
That condition loss isnt worth it
---
Holy shit. Guess it's time to start digging through rubble then, eh?
---
If it gets addressed in a update soon I will, till then I don't think PvP is going to be worth the time, and will be leaving the servers when ever this shit happens.
---
If it is legal, and Bethesda claims it is balanced, well, we shall see how long they will keep that stance üòà but I doubt allowing PvP to become "Who hit a VATS hit first." will be something people want in PvP.
---
iirc juicehead has a video on utube
---
Crits never missed for me afaik lol. 
---
I ended up buying a bunch of treasure maps and checking those forever to finally get those plans. 
---
Not sure if they are back at vendors after today‚Äôs patch or not. Used to be able to buy them in Grafton I think. But yes they do exist. 
---
I've had several miss, and it was addressed in the patch notes that this was supposedly fixed.  Missed crits have caused my alt to die quite a few times. 
---
Someone else posted a thread that states the flamer, cryo and tesla werent included in the changes at all.
---
Pretty sure that's already the case. Crippling with enforcer, tormentor, or one gun army should already make them land. 
---
Workshops realated quests: Defending and claiming them always gives you a plan, Also power up events give you generatore plans
---
With the backlash they got from announcing that, I hope they do. I'd rather everyone have fresh characters or I might not be playing.

You can ferment up to 10 beverages at a time. The assign/unassigned option is to pick what you‚Äôd like to ferment. Once 10/10 are assigned, any other beverages in your stash will disappear from the selection screen. 
---
I've played them all as well and I absolutely love this game! Its different but familar. It does have bugs still and some people have had horrible experiences but I honestly havent had any really bad happen. Its getting better with every update and if your on ps4 I'll help you level up answer questions whatever. I enjoy just walking around and killing stuff ‚ô•
---
It's not though, it seems to be on bethesdas end as I have 5he same issue and have never used mods or a custom ini.  I've seen others post the same...
---
Not really. Laser sniper is at 73 (up from 67), and needs about 3sec to recharge after every shot. It's dps is around that of a pipe pistol.
---
Mm If only we could make cheese &lt;3 
---
As I read, the quest is probably not bugged, it just has not finished, and will be expanded in future releases
---
You seen the new unmarked secret vault in the northwest corner of the map? There's a whole bunch of stuff that's changed. 
---
I hear another one of the TNT domes has opened too. 
---
He said he was using voice-to-text so I can see the Genes/Jeans confusion. 
---
The adrenal perk glitch?
---
I completed a daily quest from Biv and was given them as the quest reward 
---
Actually if you criticize the game you hate Todd Howard and his child. 
---
Ran into another dude earlier who was just as triggered by another‚Äôs emote. It‚Äôs always good for a laugh when emotes are taken to heart.
---
Idk how this hasn't been fixed and isn't getting more outrage.
---
I woke up TWICE under a location of the famous Sickleman 
---
Creepy 
---
Not just similar, these are the ones i and in my camp from day one 
---
&gt;burtethead
---
Just cause you use mods doesn't mean everyone else does.
---
Armor or mutation? Armor -&gt; stationary &amp; crouched. Mutation -&gt; stationary &amp; weapon raised. 
---
Guess you missed the sarcasm, oh well. Your confusion is of zero concern to me.
---
I enjoy it and I enjoyed all the Fallout instalments. 
---
It‚Äôs literally the only game I put my time into really. Don‚Äôt really got time to play other shit
---
IDK. Bethesda themselves mentioned that it's with the mods. The mod authors for two mods also said the same. I have never changed the ini and it seems to work fine for me.
---
It's next week I believe
---
dont know about the rifle damage, but I do know we did get a camp budget increase, or atleast I did. My camp budget was full before update now is at 75%. 
---
You, you got it.
---
Its not a single player fallout 4, i read much complaints about ppl not being able to hoard all stuff they see. Got to count and strategize what u throw in stash . And your base will be destroyed by griefers, assholes &amp; raiders. If u can tackle those things i think u will line the game . Its an online game with multiple ppl on same server so adjust to that and u are set to go üëç
---
Um...what?
---
Nice find! Has anyone been lucky enough to get any new recipes for brewing yet?
---
Good to hear
---
I have not!! This is awesome!! I'm so excited to try and solve this!!! This reminds me of playing New Vegas when I didn't have a stable source of internet and had to just dig around the Mohave until a solution popped up hahahaha I absolutely love it!
---
How does that change how underwhelming it is? If he was acting surprised, Id understand your comment, but he was clearly just waiting until he had all the information to make a well informed statement. Thah should be praised. Not criticized. 
---
i have a 1060 and keep a stable 60+ fps on near max settings
---
&gt;sadly, that didn't work :(
---
They should because watching that thing flyover your head 200 times while you potshot it, is extremely tiring some. 
---
there are way too many video search results... can you PM me the link and tell me around what time the tip is?
---
Those were the junk items that you could always sell, because it's impossible to bulk them
---
Dragon? I have a sniper build and my non legendary .308 hardened sniper rifle does 139 dmg 
---
Did you try exiting the game and reloading to fix the problem? Or just carry on struggling to fire? 
---
Do it. It's already made huge progress. Find a deal and crawl on out through the.. 
---
I did server hop and it didn‚Äôt fix it. 
---
I was thinking of respec-ing to a purely melee build, I‚Äôm like a hybrid melee - non automatic rifle build! Will keep all this in mind!
---
You are correct. Doesn't come out next week and is only available for a limited time. 
---
Sorry that text is a shitty medium for sarcasm, hence the use of 
---
"/s" 
---
Except you‚Äôre not, for example I have a build with 1 PER. By your infinite wisdom, I can unequip my perks and become a rifle build with 1 PER? I‚Äôm losing brain cells here.
---
I have purified water for thirst. It was far more useful for me to sell raw flux I couldn't use before it became inert. This is a weird change that just doesn't really make sense.

Hi down, I'm dad!
---
heh, I never even saw the mosaic tile.
---
I think that you are confusing your ‚Äúhand‚Äù of cards with the overall deck of cards.  
---
When you level up, you get to pick a new card from the overall deck to add to your ‚Äúhand‚Äù.   Every 5 levels you get a set of free cards added to your hand.  
---
You can then add and remove the cards in your hand to each category.  The number of cards that you can put in each category depends on how many points that you have allocated to that category.  
---
You only get to see the overall deck of cards when you pick a new one.  You can also look them up online. 
---
You can see your hand and the cards applied in the categories at any time.  To get to these you open the Pip Boy then press the triangle button.  To switch between categories to swap out cards, you use the right and left buttons [PS4].  
---
Fair Point.
---
I normally hate the silly outfits in the game but in the trailer when they 'introduce' the survival mode that outfit suited it well
---
I love how they can just not release stuff that they could have earlier and it'll be considered new content. Same thing with bug fixes. I'm happy this game is moving in the right direction but the Bethesda whiteknighting is just as strange as it was in BETA. 
---
Yes‚Äîit is fun and most bugs have been ironed out. 
---
Not instantly upon death
---
76 is like if you beat 4, didn't start a new save for a different playthrough, and stayed out in the wasteland because you got tired of all the NPCs saying the same lines over and over.
---
 It's actually pretty close to Fallout 4. It's speculated that at least choice/consequence will be added to the game later because of a teased content update.
---
Besides alternative playthroughs, the dialogue tree and settlement item placement there's no real difference between the two games
---
They don't really care about lore. Ya get used to it after a while. Especially if you're a TES fan. But it's just as bad with FO. 
---
If you get disconnected, your Nukashine Condition resets to full.
---
But he sells ballistic fiber which you can see the vendor has bulked and for sale.
---
Probably bad luck. I've found Marine Wetsuit plans in the Harpers hole, although the issue there is that it's so high-traffic that there's rarely a plan at all. Do try the Watoga spawns too though.
---
There are scammers out there too that say they want you to click the trade first, then take off with items.  Plus some will say the legendary will have certain effects but wont.  You cannot examine the legendary's extra stats during trading.  The trading screen is clumsy and someone not used to it could cause someone to trade with 0 price.   There was rumor that you could take the primary weapon of a person during trade, but there was no evidence that ever existed.
---
Civil War top hats, 1 cloth to craft 38 caps each with hard bargain 3. 
---
I'd rather have energy weapons also being covered by gunsmith.
---
I sell Bulked Scrap and miscellaneous aid (ie chems I don‚Äôt use, like Rad-X). If I‚Äôm lucky and the timing works out, I sell 1* Legendaries and Armor. 
---
You could inspect multi-star items at vendors before the patch. I found some pretty nice items that way.
---
I just have a normal handmade have not found a TSE... ever.  But the way that TSE is calculated, it does far more damage than any other gun in game of the same base type.   Excluding perks and builds.  Just comparing weapon to weapon, it exceeds everything else.   The Two Shot increases all mutations/perks/other effects on the weapon and adds quite a bit more damage than 25%.
---
its because its all multiplicative and not additive.
---
Melee will always do more damage in this game due to high dmg on weapons and penetration at 90%.
---
Why is this getting downvoted? Why do reddit virgins still think it's okay to say this shit..
---
I know full well it's just to avoid leaks but, to me that cements that we are all in a simulation. üòÇ
---
Civil war top hat, costs 1 cloth to make and sells for 33 caps with hard bargain.
---
They are supposed to feel scarce early on. Eventually you will have more plans than you know what to do with. A buddy and I kept saving plans and compiling from other players until my friend had about 75lbs of plans even after dishing out the extras to other people on our friends lists. (This was a couple of weeks ago)
---
As previously stated, claiming and defending workshops provide a nice steady stream of plans though you will notice a lot of the workshop attained plans become "common". What you want to do is trade with other players or buy from vendors. 
---
you need to read the poster that you either craft and place in your camp, or you can go on the search for it. once you read it then the quest will start. 
---
You can't bulk ballistic fiber in the current version. 
---
Nope. This is my second playthrough with a fresh character made a couple of days ago. The penintentiary isn't a nice place for low level characters.
---
I'm from Milwaukee originally even though I live in Tomah now. Being a city boy I've never hadta milk a cow before but I did see two headed calf at the state fair when I was a kid 
---
1500 is more than enough total carry weight or 30000 as you put it with out perks. With the heaviest items being things like the fat man, minigun, missile launcher all tricked out and weighing approximately 40lbs, that gives you 750 of them that you can carry. You cant tell me that you cant keep inventory full with being able to carry items that with reduced weight average 1-2lbs. Whether its food, chems, ammo, armor or weapons, that is well beyond an acceptable amount of weight  along with an 800lb stash box for multiples mules.
---
You were teamed. You don't get all the caps to yourself. Any caps he loses is split somewhat evenly between you and the rest of your team.  
---
It doesn't sound gay. It sounds like, not related to orientation at all.
---
Also get the game. It's fun!
---
Its not the pure fallout experience you're used to, but it can be fun. If you have past MMO experience a lot of familiar practices come into play, grinding xp, farming loot, ect. 
---
The biggest thing that sets it apart (aside from multiplayer) is the survival aspect and how it limits your storage, forcing you to make decisions  on what you keep and what you don't, unlike before you do not have unlimited storage at settlements/camps so you dont get to keep everything.
---
Crashed 3 times in about 20 mins on xbox. Quit shortly thereafter

Running on those settings with Ryzen 2600x on a x370 pro 4 board 1070 and  16gb ripsaw 3200. Also runs Anthem at around 70ish fps on ultra settings in 1080p if that means anything to you.
---
Because OP is not being homophobic.
---
The term ‚Äúgay‚Äù has been used in gaming since the late nineteens to describe something that suck. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it is issuing hate towards non hetero people.
---
Yes he could used something else and this term will eventually die out with.
---
This is the same location as my base as well! Nice variety of junk, a recipe, a cap stash, and a level 3 safe are all inside of the the preexisting structure.
---
I built mine up and into the power pylon as far as I could go. I really do love this location. Cheers mate. 
---
They get into the 1000s of damage in melee yes, because of two very specific builds.  The Unyielding build relies on getting your health as low as possible through the use of radiation and keeping it there.   The armor adds massive boosts to all stats but endurance.  The other is bloodied, which makes the weapon itself do far more damage base on your lower health.  Sure you can have unyielding and bloodied weapons which further increase the damage.
---
Please...for the love of all that his holy let it be Vault 77. I will become "The Puppet Man".
---
Yup!
---
This happened to me a few times over the past few patches. Sometimes it‚Äôs broken and sometimes it‚Äôs not. 
---
It was a first for me
---
Do you serve that drink that makes you wake up in the ashes with a scorched beast flying over your head?
---
Having the same issue
---
I have noticed this to be true especially on the white spring ghouls, seems I‚Äôve gotten more goodies off diseased enemies than I have regular non starred legendary ones.
---
Do you know where the plans can be acquired?
---
Having made pyro characters in every game in the series sans BoS, and having them always be crazy fun and powerful, I was so hyped up for making one in 76 only to be left feeling really lukewarm.
---
It feels awesome roasting a grounded scorchbeast in seconds, but after the thrill wears off you realize you just ate up so much resource grinding on one boss. It's not much more fun in PvP where the whole meta revolves around one-shotting your opponent with significantly less ammo.
---
Came across a big today after the update,  I went looking for military ammo bags at Camp Mclinktok and got the Recruitment Blues quest after already heaving finished it months ago. It is still in the list of quests I have finished
---
Well I now know what I‚Äôm doing with my keycards!
---
Yeah I know. It just isn't balanced when a guy at 10% health can one shot a guy at 100% health, when the guy at 100% health has to hit the guy with 10% health 4 times to drop him.
---
Aside from costumes and apparel, bulk and chems... 
---
Purified water sells for 5 caps each.
---
You could also *not* scrap weapons and sell them instead.

This was more geared towards the plasma rifle and pistols as they just started dropping with legendary variants with this patch, but I‚Äôm curious to see how your gun performs now after the buff.
---
I‚Äôve got the initiate paint if you‚Äôre on xbox
---
I am not using mods and i cant examine the items either
---
sell caps to vendors in 1 game session and you get more than enough to afford the brick set
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate :/ I hope they work out the issues!
---
That's a horror vault be careful over there u can get spooky üòÇüòÇ
---
Yes you are right, but the intention was competitive PVP.  Not Griefing like how its working now.    If its intentional, they really dont understand how PVP should work.   Right now, one person can be off on their own doing quests and someone can start the content at any time then go visit the other player and just 1 shot them.   Thats not PVP in my opinion, thats just "spawn" camping if you will.   No its not exactly "spawn" camping but its very much like the same thing. No risk to the attacker at all and very destrimental and no chance at surviving to the victim.   Based on the current set up, they really need to make a splash screen or warning to players who claim workshops to inform them how PVP works in this game.  New people are flooding the game right now due to the sales and all of those wont know this.
---
Just delete your old ini.
---
Pic please? I don't have access to my game currently due to being on vacation. 
---
3 times 
---
I got it to work prior to Patch 5, I stopped playing FO76 for a few months now.  So not sure if Patch 5/6 affected it.
---
Good thing I held onto that TSE .50 Cal. Only level 35 though. I bet I can still make it work.
---
It happened to me last week when I did it twice in the same session, first time was fine, second time completely empty
---
People who prefer to move around a lot still use them because theyre easy to place.
---
Well iron fist only has one card to max out, soo then I'd say martial artist and insisor. Bloodied build is the go to atm so nerd rage and what not. Google bloodied unarmed build fallout 76 in youtube and you should get the jist of it
---
Will try that, thanks
---
No on PC. Which platform?
---
I played for a total of about 20 minutes. Crashed 3 times and quit. New challenge menu on map was a welcome addition but is TERRIBLE. Pops up every 2 seconds if you're doing something like "kill scorched" or similar. Became unusable in the limited time I spent with it. Also the text in the challenge menu looks RIDICULOUS. "ATOMS (10)" with the atom symbol after looks so so dumb. Also everybody's damage seems to be cut in half thanks to the new adrenal reaction "fix". Seems like it's time to respec AGAIN. Glad to see they didn't do anything about the vertibirds (haven't tested). Anyway I'll probably stumble upon more tomorrow if I can actually get the game functioning properly. 
---
Don't even get me started on the fact that I'm an alcoholic and having all the content centered around drinking and frat life is a huge trigger. Not an issue for most people but figured I'd mention lol
---
Thanks for clarifying what you meant. I'm glad you're having so much fun with the game, and I do enjoy the game for the most part too.
---
Hah...I'm a filthy casual...I've only done one of these so far, but all I had to fend off were lots and lots of dogs.  Fun times!
---
It‚Äôs made progress to the point that it is playable, but you‚Äôre still going to constantly run into bugs, and occasionally run into game breaking ones. Also, there is still no endgame apart from an incredibly badly designed boss fight.
---
But you can't take those home. Did Joker fall into one of the tanks before he became Joker?
---
There‚Äôs a way to check, there‚Äôs a holo tape you play.
---
Post a photo if you can.
---
Yeah I saw that to I liked the grass in the golf course around my base now it feels weird
---
I bought one today and got the challenge completed. It's bugged evidently so that it is achieved whenever you actually complete a trade, regardless of whether you're the buyer or seller. 
---
Wait really what does the milk do?
---
I'd like it to drop any colour other than weathered or dirty white lol
---
It wont let me. 
---
That means you only had login information on someone elses account if they did not want to give up allowing data to be changed.  Anything like that is a red flag.   I would never ever recommend doing anything like that.  All you did was rent someone's account and help them gain ATOMs on that account.  
---
Have you tryed death?
---
I wish someone had nuked Morgantown when I was doing the quest. Do you think the party crashers would be glowing ones? A tight space like that would be a lot of fun.
---
Unfortunately so
---
I can confirm. TNT Dome 7 can now be unlocked
---
Nah, ours is the juice that makes you wake up face down in the mud with a Wendigo chewing on your leg. 
---
What's your ign, I would like to check it out.
---
&gt; Also, it's not an MMO. 
---
i agree with what you've said but its pretty much an mmo with extra steps
---
I thought the mini gun was good before using a tse on the queen did a decent amount of damage.
---
It's really nice, I'm on pc too, so I need to see this place :) I'm low lvl actually, so I'm far from harper ferry but would love to see this Bar when I can ^^  ( if you agree I take your charname to add you ) 
---
Or the fact that nobody ever actually wants to trade. There was a guy who had 50 stimpacks and I requested to buy some, and because he didn‚Äôt see anything he liked he would sell me any of his stuff. 
---
Weapon durability's mostly fine. If you use a few different guns then you'll often out-level them before you need to repair them. Armor durability is more of an issue, although there are workarounds.
---
800 stash is reasonable. 400 was horrible, 600 was a pain if you liked to keep interesting legendaries. Personal carry weight is plenty, especially if you take a few weight-management perks. My rifle character has 8 STR because I'm a med hoarder and like to carry six different guns at once.
---
There's not much end game. It's surprisingly fun playing through again with a new character/build though, even with Whitesprings being a nightmare zone of max-level ghouls.
---
Buildings can't be destroyed when you're offline, although apparently they can be wrecked fast if you are. Repair costs aren't heavy unless you have a decontamination shower. I haven't personally seen much griefing on PC. Might be more common on consoles.
---
Not much RPG stuff built in, other than an impressive array of different costumes. Mostly when you run into other players you wave to each other, do the event and then move on. You are free to talk weird shit over the mic, or build mothman shrines in your workshops.
---
Scrap the blueprint and rebuild. All the individual components will still be stored and able to placed one at a time for free. It's aggravating, but it beats wasting caps trying to find somewhere just right to drop an existing build. 
---
Is that for real? Do you know if it is per person or for a team? So could each member of a team launch a nuke or is everyone affected by a cool down?
---
IGN is Carrek. 
---
It's what facilitated stacking foundations, so yes. 
---
Of course IGN is Carrek
---
They are also a super noticeable blue when they become nuked  in Whitespring.  I had never seen them around there till today.  
---
The lever-action skin damn
---
Thanks 
---
You didn't have to do that in the first place before the update... I have had no problem moving crops since I started playing the beginning of the year. The only problem I ever had with crops was if I went to the CAMP device to repair it would state I needed 3x the amount to repair, so instead I would just manually repair each crop for 1.
---
That's not how words work though. You had to say "non-hetero" people yourself to keep out of a logical hole. So how can you use a word that doesn't mean suck or bad, then use degradingly, then pretend like it's not supposed to be offensive? Allowing this type of shit, like the OP, creates negative stigma against and green lights homophobia to progress. Why not say "damn that's so hetro" instead? (Not a suggestion but just pointing out the logic)
---
Nothing about being gay sucks, other than dealing with the straights.. 
---
Derogatorily calling things gay shows and obvious lack of intelligence
---
Except that's not why nukes were disabled at New Years. They screwed up creating a new keyword set. 
---
I'm sure this is a similar bug. If they didn't want events nuked they'd just add temporary green zones on the targeting computer. 
---
Thanks, I have seen some bases though that blow mine out of the water. It's just a matter of being on at the right time and on the right server. Some of the things this community makes are great.
---
Weird i was on with a friend and he said his assaulttron head was working amazing now.
---
Escape Artist does not work 100% though.  Crouching/Standing/Crouching will not reduce visuals and take you from Caution to Non-Caution like it says but will allow you to move faster without penalties.   So I take it because of that.   I tested without using it and found went into caution state much faster at farther away.
---
So much. But when they do land...it's on
---
Well my stimpak healing percantage goes up when i equip it so i guess it still works
---
Nope. Budget changes existing bases
---
Same, but mine sell just for 33 so I need 1/2 pieces of junk or  2bobby pins to drain a vendor of his caps.
---
I didn't know fallout 76 sounds like a homosexual, how were you able to deduce that from an inanimate object? 
---
I'll take a gay game over a hetro game any day!! 
---
They are .45
---
I came over from GTAO, where I didn‚Äôt pvp but was into the economy of it. I loved making the in-game currency and buying crap. When I finally walked away from GTA, I was Level 335, owned everything, and had a $40m savings. In Fallout, my first goal was to reach max caps. I did that before I reached level 25. 
---
Farming Legendaries is how I reached my level without even attempting the quests, but now I feel it‚Äôs time. Besides, some of the quest rewards are pretty awesome. :)
---
If it‚Äôs the brick building set I have a extra I can sell for 500. 
---
Suggested a while ago https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aptec0/your_top_5_things_to_fix_now_in_the_short_term/
---
Just change special to specials with the extra s being static or skills which don‚Äôt need to be changed 
---
The raider camps normally have a ton of ammo boxes in them. If you've got the Scrounger perk, chuck that on and search them for extras.
---
Mostly I farm Scorched though. They drop a good range of guns &amp; ammo, and don't take many bullets to kill if you pop them in the head. Mole Miners are good for shotgun shells. Low-level super mutants for 308. If you're using more ammo than you're finding then you're probably fighting too many ghouls and animals, and maybe not abusing enough stealth bonuses.
---
Hrm, a QOL adjustment???  I think its something they left in by accident!
---
Yea that's new my camp is near there and havnt seen it before excited to see what it becomes
---
Yea, a few items like ballistic fiber are sold by the vendors as bulked, but you can't bulk them yourself, so that being the case you can sell them unbulked.  
---
Bulk screws is another one. You can find them in the world (maybe buy them? don't recall if I've ever seen a vendor selling them), but you can't bulk them yourself, so you can sell them individually. 
---
No, its happy Pi day!  3-14-2019!
---
Clear and concise title haha
---
Crashed once on PS4 today. But that was out of like 5 hours of gameplay. Can't remember what caused it.
---
Ah, so it seems just to be a visual bug. I also have the healing factor mutation and it did not update the -55% chem effects in the pip boy after equipping the class freak perk.
---
Thanks!
---
Wow, thanks
---
Orrrrr like the rest of reddit this sub has become a small community of like minded people that love the game and all the haters just left- cause, why stay around? 
---
Nah. Definitely not that. 
---
Glad to hear it :)
---
Whoa... i knew they would eventually pull a Final Fantasy XIV aka a Division 1. 
---
Thanks man, glad you like this spot too. Building up into the pylon is a cool idea.
---
Looks like you're about to drop the sickest album. I'm on board 
---
Thank you. I'll try for this. Seems to be the fastest, once you acquire the plans.
---
I always looked at the stimpaks directly and See what percantage they have 
---
I don't know if it works when your offline but it only takes like 10 minutes when your online.
---
OOPS   Mutation -&gt; unarmored &amp; stationary &amp; weapon raised. 
---
I need to look these up then. Never found any plans there.
---
Oh okay. I thought maybe the longer you left it in there the more potent it got. 
---
inert flux sells for quite a bit of caps to vendors
---
10 minutes isn‚Äôt bad at all though.
---
No, but they fixed scrapper ! 
---
The locations seem to be random, I ended up in the Mire.
---
I think couse game is going in the direction that most players really wanted. Bethesda putting a lot of effort in fo76, repairing bugs, adding new content, not to mention Betehsda is listening to the community feedback and reacting to it. Thats briliant! Road map for this year looks amazing as well. All that makes everyone happy.
---
It might do but if you notice somthing that is fermenting has a condition bar that slow degrades which represents how long it has left 
---
Oh okay so it can go bad then if I leave it in there to long.
---
Keep taking workshops, grab your plan &amp; then move on, don't hang round or defend. As you get caps for clearing the workshop, I think it only costs an extra 5 caps  to make it yours. Get the plan &amp; other crap as a reward &amp; either try another one or server hop &amp; do the same workshop again.
---
I'm xb1 too. A few others here said it also happens on other platforms 
---
Same here.
---
Then farm smart, i didnt get my legendaries from drops, i bought them with caps, 1k a day from vendors
---
Cry all u guys want but legendaries will never be taken out of pve or pvp servers..... bc thats just ridicuous and u guys r on the wrong side 
---
I'll check it out, thanks!
---
I‚Äôm pretty stoked. This patch was really cool. I can‚Äôt wait to do the daily for it tomorrow to see what I get.
---
Did some limited testing.  Post [1.0.0.8](https://1.0.0.8), SD still seems to give the appropriate number extra items, but the notifications have changed. The single after crafting notification can indicate one or more dups. 
---
Yeah, Flamer is next on track for some Buffs.
---
I don't think it goes bad it just has a condition bar to show you how long till it's finished fementing 
---
The shot at 1:53 is the exact spot my friend's camp is that he specifically chose because it was hard to find, guess its not that hard to find
---
I hope we get to blow the alpine horn. I'm on top of a mountain and this would be perfect 
---
Oh okay I see. 
---
same shit happened to me, bought it yesterday
---
Just click install and point to the location where the game is installed and it will fix itself.
---
Really? I've been playing since release and for the longest time you just couldn't simply pick up and move crops. I haven't bothered using crops for a good month or so though. None of the updates ever listed such a change then or now, so maybe it went completely under the radar for me.
---
There are reports that Nerd Rage is not applying the damage buff.
---
Can't confirm myself because I have no before/after data - I was working on my bloodied build when patch 6 broke Adrenal Reaction so I put it on hold and 'worked' on other stuff.
---
They are adding new underground locations as per the trailer.
---
Most of the players are very nice and helpful. We‚Äôre all just trying to survive out there too lol. Word of warning, if someone ever tells you to follow them to their camp, watch to make sure there aren‚Äôt pressure plates on the floor by the door. Or a jail cell door inside. They‚Äôre leading you into a trap where you‚Äôll most likely be burned by flamethrowers until you‚Äôre dead. Then they‚Äôll take your stuff and hop servers. It happened to me when I first started.
---
Can you open it?
---
Upload the photo to imgur and post a link.
---
The compass was working right till the patch in December that changed how many markers would be shown at a time after that it was off to the right when your out of power amour it works like it should lol
---
Yeah I'm just trying to find someone to do a trade like sell item for 1 cap or buy item for 1 cap etc.
---
Do your research of you think the vendors outfits are rare...
---
Sucks that it wasn't, but what are we to do about it?
---
Had a "die hard" player follow me and a lvl 17 buddy  through the whitespring nuke zone repeatedly attacking us just to slowly reduce the amount of caps we had. We wouldnt fight back cus he would just kill us faster at that point. Dude was an embarrassing high level to pick on a lvl 50 and 17. Couldn't believe it. I've never seen anyone harass a noob so bad before. Hopefully my buddy is willing to come back to the game after having such a bad first experience with the high level community.
---
Very weird
---
I hope they deal with this aswell i love energy weapons but they just dont feel great compared to fallout 4, NV  and 3.
---
Ah you‚Äôre one of those people who just can‚Äôt accept some people use words for different meanings.
---
Thanks friend, instead of making a snide remark maybe provide some examples of why that‚Äôs the case? I‚Äôd really like to know. 
---
I've added you post to my round up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0wsik/hold_the_preemptive_congratulations_until_we_know/)
---
Yes! Card and code entered, just coming back to the light as you approach the map machine. 
---
Also completely naked with every weapon on you broken. 
---
Yeah you should get it. I got it about a month ago and I have to say, all the YouTube reviewers are full of shit. It‚Äôs a good and fun game to play solo or with others.
---
Nope.
---
My camp is sitting on that pit too
---
Freddy is a radioactive goul in another part of the map. You find the little ID bracelet on him and all. Can't remember exactly where though, definitely caves. 
---
My friends and I were trying to figure that out earlier with a bloodied 50 cal. Didn't realize it was nerd rage
---
I tried the game again today after a few weeks off to give me a fresh perspective and because I was bored. 
---
\-Still the usual boring clothes in the Atom Store.  The Sniper outfit was okay but over-priced as was everything else. Didn't buy anything - partly because the prices were too high and the CAMP budget way too low. Wouldn't be able to use it anyway.  Only one unattractive new Power Armour Skin?  This would have been the one thing I would invest in. Why? How hard could that be?
---
\-Got kicked off the server within five minutes of slow, non-combat play.
---
\-Still far to much monitoring of the 3 health bars required. Very, very boring, annoying and not at all fun. Something needs to radically change there.  The system in FO4 was much better, though simpler and less sophisticated. This shouldn't be such an important part of the game. 
---
\-Trader cap limits still ridiculously low, given the fact that we have to pay to fast travel. One cap for a gun?  Stupid.
---
\-Despite the stash weight increase, which helps, I'm still trudging everywhere and not moving around enough to have fun because of the ridiculous cap charges on fast travel.  I really think you need to get rid of them entirely.  They ruin the game for me, every time I try to get into it.  In Fallout 4 I bounce around the map and have a ball because I can set my own speed level and pace.  If I start to get bored I go somewhere else, not that there is any where much to go in this game.  Not possible to jump around in this game because EVERYTHING is about budget. It's a bore. 
---
\-Still no hope of a jet-pack - my great joy in FO4. 
---
\-In short, I lasted about 2 hours this time and I'm gone again. 
---
Or you could just not be a dick and answer his question. He may not have seen the other posts.
---
Any lore about how these just pop up? 
---
I like yours too, it's very clean and sleek looking. I can see you made it so the hidden train cars are like your basement.
---
Well, of course I can. But equating "gay" with "wrong" seems to do a disservice to our friends who swing the other way. There are countries where it's still punishable by death to be gay. I think we owe it to those friends to be a little more respectful of who they are and not equate that with being wrong, when taking the what could happen if they were born in the wrong place into account. :)
---
There's a currently suspended player in the trade discord I spoke to, he was saying some accounts had been unsuspended yet his wasn't yet. Though I did assume that this was the update to do that
---
Every patch they do adds more bugs and then they need to patch the patch to patch the patch and so on lol makes me have no faith in them as a software company I know I'll never buy another game of theirs after this train wreck they clearly shown they don't have a clue what they were doing
---
Also it really acts like a tamed creature, it patrols the camp area but never leaves the camp border.
---
Really, really strange.
---
Just found this out myself tbh. 100 levels of my beta character having no profile picture.
---
Now its a third person view of him looking down on a nuked hemlock holes
---
Wrong! It's still to hard to complete the 'kill the golfers' quest at whitesprings, the game is completely broken! I'm quitting!
---
Good, I have stuff to do this weekend lol
---
The one where you do too much damage and guns stop working
---
It's down the stairs and right behind the stairs. IF you face the bar it's to The right in that room :) 
---
If someone over lvl 5p has a camp I'll always do a cool check. If they don't emote back to me. . . Let's just say some manners are taught the hard way.
---
I mean... i kind of just want to forget it bro lol. 
---
It's very good to differentiate your characters better on the selection screen. 
---
I think it's fair to call that hearsay.
---
I can make it for you if you‚Äôve got the components. I‚Äôm on ps4 also
---
Nerf means it was made worse. It was crap before. It's crap now. That's not a nerf
---
as a lvl ~180 player i mostly just play with a friend or two, farm events and xp with them and just do dumb stuff and countless nukes. can easily play 4-8 hours a day with a good friend even without anything specific to do like quests
---
for when i‚Äôm solo i just do camp building until i get sick of it, and mostly junk hoarding while looking for any places on the map that i might not have fully explored yet and just go through every rock and corner of those locations
---
Some people on xbox were complaining about this. I thought xbox didn't have mods
---
Ha I havent seen it yet! Need to catch up!
---
Straight jackets sell for 44
---
NOOOOoooooooo...The Age of Bumblebee is coming to an end!
---
You have to be shitting me. How shill can you get dude? This game was a MESS!!!! I played it for a while, as long as i could stomach, i'm logging in now so i expect a lot of stability and bugs ironed out. This game earned every bit of shit it got so don't act like you're part of some elite crew who stuck it out. I bought two copies one for my wife, one for me. I showed my f'ing support so kill the grandstanding nonsense bro.   
---
Pointblank, they fucked up. It shouldn't have launched like it did, just like Final Fantasy XIV shouldn't have, but they turned it around, just like Division 1 shouldn't have, but they turned it around. Doesn't mean those of us who got fed up and walked away are any less than those of you who celebrate mediocrity. 
---
Hard lemonade tastes like lemony piss... 0/10 good day sir!
---
Sorry it‚Äôs a joke from my Brother-in-law because I gave him some in game and he built a portable toilet in my camp, went in and drank it...
---
You see what he was going for and why I had trouble breathing for a bit.
---
Remember Vault 95?
---
The bug introduced in patch 6 wherein Class Freak completely disables Adrenal Reaction is still present, with Bethesda reportedly looking into a fix.
---
Well put ‚úäüèª
---
OP is a fucking clown, and i for one am sick of his mentality in the community, in any community. This happens with every game that releases like dogshit. You always have the grandstanding idiots who just want to thank the people who "stuck it out maaaaan" like they're accepting some sort of academy award lol. It's both annoying and pathetic. 
---
Server hopping isnt the same as closing the game then reopening it
---
Oh come on now... you went to the other extremes. Yeah, yeah, the naysayers are pretty annoying, but the "hurray!" is far too early. Believe me: in days the community will be pissed off again with the brand new bugs, the known bugs they didn't fix, and how thin the actual content is. You are just witnessing another unnecessary 9 day wonder.
---
Oh, and its not what happens with every MMO. Most of the MMOs are out in two years max. One of the greatest exceptions on the other side is WoW. You know why? Yeah, it had connection issues for obvious reasons at the start, but it didn't promise more and deliver less than what was said it would be. Back in 2004 it was an industry standard... now you applaud half-done games and hoping for the best. Do as you will, just don't think you are 100% right.
---
How ? Does it now give other stuff besides basic materials?
---
They just wanted to show off their tv
---
Wait, you did? Because it says atomic shop only
---
A) Serial complainers / outrage idiots are mostly gone.
---
B) The game is good. :-)
---
C) The game is GETTING EVEN BETTER!
---
Thanks for pointing out the positivity.  Let it continue!
---
Could be take a radx and test
---
Yeah that's another thing, guy is acting like people who did stick it out, weren't bored af and out trolling people. I myself had trolling incidents 3 times, all from stupid high levels between the first month and a couple of weeks ago. Everything from people trying to steal my f'ing caps, to attacking my CAMP and stalking my wife. 
---
I have first-hand knowledge that this is also a problem on PS4 and I've seen reports today which indicate that it occurs on Xbox, too. 
---
I kinda like Anthem... but to be honest those loading times was a too big a turnoff. Im a patient guy, but that......... 
---
Good idea.
---
I've added your post to my round up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0wsik/hold_the_preemptive_congratulations_until_we_know/)
---
You know if all those cups where lootable people would clear that place so fast everyone coming into the mission new wouldn‚Äôt understand there was a party!
---
Add Blocker to this.
---
Or maybe they want nuke launches to be more rare for the new people coming in who aren't jaded.  Just a thought.
---
Never been there.   I haven't finished Fallout 4 yet and apparently that is where that is.    Time to boot up F4 and check it out.
---
The wiki on it sounds interesting.
---
Yep.  ESO, NMS, FFXIV.  This game will be a success: count on it.
---
Merc has spoken.
---
Some people celebrate mediocrity. Could be worse though, you could be a whale... oh god... maybe you're both...  
---
This is why we can't have good game launches anymore kids.   
---
Lol this entire thread is a circlejerk isn't it? 
---
Outrage culture people can get out of the game now; they have nothing to do but hop from game to game, point out the weaknesses, cry loudly, and then move on.  SEE YA!
---
Game's awesome, and getting better.  Woop!
---
Ha haaaa...you feel like a filthy casual to me, friend. :-)
---
Noone's gonna hire you in the gaming press.  Don't quit your day job.
---
Damn, busted! :D
---
Yeah you should probably stop playing, it's a travesty.
---
Maybe WoW is more your speed.
---
This is a variant of the existing stairs I mentioned. The railing on these look different, but they're functionally identical. 
---
You're clearly in need of help, and I hope you never get it. This was hilarious! The music choice just brought it all together.
---
It's a video game.  Get a life.
---

---
AFAIK, it was a limited time Atomic Shop exclusive.
---
my gun energy damage and gun accuracy doesn't decrease -50% doesn't decrease with class freak. but thats about it.
---
Can you ferment regular alcohol you find? 
---
I'm not going to lie to you if it's on sell really cheap then get it other wise no don't get it yet there is tons of bugs still some from the beta some from December that I doubt will ever be fixed and with every patch they brake something else and add more bugs than they fix the patch 6 added a bug that now when I get in or out of power amour my quick change secondary weapon (ie left on d-pad) becomes unequipped and I have to go through my Pip-Boy or the favorites wheel to re-equip it and it also happens when you get into a fight even if you had just gone through and equipped everything and it happens every single time and I've reported it a few times and you get the same response from them that they will pass it on to the development team but they can't help me with my problem it's a waste of money as it is now. I've played fallout 3 and 4 and new Vegas and all those are way better than this failure I WAS a big fan of fallout and Bethesda but after this money grab game I'll never buy a Bethesda game again unless it's free
---
Then you were in a party with someone who did...idiot
---
I got a Blackwater brew recipe. Also hard lemonade!
---
then play some thing else more your speed..............pin the tail on the donkey is blind person friendly.
---
I didn't notice these are a different variant
---
You only needed to carry 3? My gatling plasma broke before the 2nd clip is totally empty (prior to patch). Then again that was only at 100% condition... but still I'd have to travel back to my base and repair every 3-5 minutes if I only carried 3 gatling plasmas. They're super strong weapons though and I can't wait to find another one that's good. Sad that I sold my good one several months ago. Actually that's not true, it was heavy and useless, I'm sad that it wasn't good several months ago.
---
i dont have a problem with class freak..adrenal reaction still working for me with that perk on..its strange in numbers that disables adrenal reaction for me..[PS4] its not just me..few of my friends have the same issue with strange in numbers
---
Where in trailer exactly you can tell it? There is not a single hint to "It's a seasonal content", "Up coming season" or "Not everything is already inside the game". What makes it even worse, Beth site labels it as "Fallout 76 - Free Wild Appalachia Update Now Available". People who don't follow the news, thinks everything they see in trailer is already available. 
---
LMAO... Google fallout 76 how to launch nukes fast.. it just got fixed and has been around since November...
---
Well sneak my or may not be fixed but enemies spawning under the map is still a thing.
---
can still see the baseball bat, but nice editing.  
---
Thank you for the offer.
---
I will try something else first and may come back to you.
---
My 3 star Exploding Gatling Plasma is long gone... &lt;cry&gt;  Just vendered it because well... melting reasons.
---
Nice, did you go back to start a new quest?
---
I mean... this update really didn't add anything aside from the ability to craft alcohol. 
---
That's not really going to suck me back in, nor will it revitalize the playerbase; it's a quest chain and some drinks. 
---
You will be ok. An investigation will be opened on your account, but I suspect after multiple reports. I‚Äôve had players report me today for initiating pvp via workshops. As long as you play by the world rules, I doubt you‚Äôll get banned.
---
It's still good to gamble on the 3 stars. Just picked up a weapon weight reduction piece for 100 caps. Also Bethesda knows and are working on it
---
that remind me of the "the game is fine for me, the server only crash 2 or 3 times a day but it's still playable". Yes that was a real unironic comment on this sub not long ago.
---
Errr... TS doesn't use any more ammo or create any more recoil than normal.
---
It doesn't work that way lol.
---
Nothing will happen, the guy was salty and he needed the last word.
---
Let's pretend that they would look into the report. It will show details lol.
---
In other words, enjoy the 1000 caps and ignore.
---
Sorry, don't have any flux.
---
That was actually well written content.  Reads much like a professional book.  Nice work!
---
K byyyyeeeeee please don't keep checking this reddit byyyyeeeeeee
---
My friends bloodied explosive scattershot laser (even post buffs) still breaks before the first clip is empty. They made some stuff **viable** but they didn't fix everything.
---
Why do they hate the cryo and flamers so?
---
It will be the new underground area that we see in the trailer. 
---
[Watogabar ](https://imgur.com/gallery/cInxoGd) 
---
Yooooo nice. I made a few bars since the start and made this one recently. 
---
Still no welcome mat though! Grrrr
---
Nope, but is gives way more ressources, like twice it was before.
---
Now i can do west tek and get enough steel to craft like 3k/5k .50 ammo if I'm lucky with super duper.
---
good to hear they are on to it
---
Morgantown is fixed so it doesn't spawn legendaries I'm pretty sure. Never seen a legendary there nuked or otherwise
---
Yeah I know that. I‚Äôm just saying these are saying Atomic Shop. I obviously know there‚Äôs one like it already. 
---
I don't think Bethesda knows how to fix anything they just hope everyone will get tired of complaining and move on to something else so they don't have to work on it anymore lol
---
I'm glad the hate train has moved on to Anthem...
---
My anti armor gatling laser still feels pretty underwhelming while my .50 cal rocks.
---
No its because people quit the game
---
I can't find any information on nukes causing bugs. I guess the crops you need would turn to flux, in which case server hop or visit the massive farms to the west of the map. Not a bug.
---
Personally the difficulty was quite trivial and unrewarding for me I would have preferred the area nuked.
---
When are we getting a Fallout movie?
---
Laser rifles are still garbage. Why didn't all energy weapons get the 5x condition treatment instead of just a few?
---
And also, when the vault raids would come, it would encourage playing them.
---
I've gotten this before too lol
---
I was on your server! I saw you both, I recognised the guy heart and girl heart images, and wondered what the hell you were both doing out there. Awesome find guys!
---
Hmm, I am guessing this happened in last patch?  Characters that are severely overweight now suffer drink/hunger rapidly?
---
Would be nice if you could not see like 50 feet away without a flashlight or something.  Night vision scopes would become hugely popular.
---
My dropped items are disappearing on PS4 since update
---
Secret doors should totally be a thing. I‚Äôd be happy with a hinged bookcase or a closet with a false back. 
---
Even the Responders used chems, man. Guess you're more of a Mistress of Mysteries player
---
/u/Aten_Ra more bugs to confirm and add to the unofficial bugs list.
---
With +40% bashing damage, this is sounding like a heavy, general purpose club, not something I‚Äôd use to lob Mini Nukes onto other players 
---
Wow, so those GunFu veterans are now GODS?
---
Also the weights in the prison are not able to be picked up.
---
You should insult it
---
This is happening to me on Xbox
---
At least yours is just scorched earth, whenever i spawn in i maybe have 5 square feet of floor space and then fall through the floor and die, i also cant fast travel due to over encumbered and cant drop anything...
---
Dude, Reddit is in some ways the literal worst place on the internet excluding places that help fuel trafficking and illegal activities.
---
I looked at 4chan once a while ago and those freaks at least admit to being freaks, reddit is just unapologetically biased and basically a bunch of mobs all roaming cyber space waiting to scream at something.
---
If you want a better experience, you're gonna need to be subtle with people here.
---
As a vats crit build, I can confirm misses do occur and it made no sense lol. 
---
Post patch, seems fine so far.
---
Trustworthy is the word. Trustable is not a word. 
---
Haha sorry, english is not my first lenguage
---
He deserves some cheese.
---
That's ok. I wasn't trying to make fun. Just inform. 
---
Yeah I suppose that'd do it
---
The texture on the nuka girl outfit is still bugged on console where the players belly button should be.
---
Nah learn how to reddit 
---
Seconded!  Plasma Gatling broke twice during 1 SB.   Well two different plasma gatling that is.
---
So... what up with the NSFW tag? Did I miss something interesting?
---
Maybe they're secretly OP in the right builds and no ones discovered those builds yet?
---
Naw, the flamer is basically unusable and endlessly not worthwhile.  The cryolater I hear is a great weapon on the sbq though.
---
Nerf did not go far enough actually.
---
All they need to do is change the algorithym so its additive.
---
25% x base dmg + 20% x base dmg + Perk X base damage.   That will fix everything.
---
What platform you on?
---
Yeah, the Blackwater was from Biv, he just had me drink a bottle of vodka then do a stealth kill and report back to him. Hard lemonade was from a new vendor in a random encounter 
---
Ps4 sir
---
&gt; How durable are weapons?
---
Without perks, most weapons will last several kills before breaking.
---
With a perk to repair above 100%, it can last about 2x as long when that perk is maxed out.
---
With a perk to let it's durability last 50% longer, it's about another 2x as long.
---
Generally, weapons last long enough just fine - with both the perks, you can pretty easily just stick to 2 weapons on-hand without needing to waste carry weight on more.
---
&gt;  Weight limit?
---
You'll be using perks to help reduce weights on stuff, or increase your carry weight.  With them, the weight limit isn't tough to work with.
---
The more annoying thing is how many steps it takes to really manage it.  Nearly all junk needs to get scrapped (ie: a typewriter to it's component parts).  And the component parts need to get bulk packaged to save even more weight.  So inventory management is going to be a thing no matter how you look at it.
---
The stash limit is 800, which is "enough" to keep several alternative weapons &amp; gear, and/or have a nice collection of junk for repairs &amp; building, but regardless, you'll constantly be fiddling with your stash &amp; inventory.
---
&gt; How do servers work?
---
You join a server when you click 'play' in the main menu.  It finds a server automatically and once you're 'in game', you're 'on a server'.
---
&gt; Are they hosted by Bethesda?
---
As far as anyone can tell, yes.
---
&gt; Can you switch servers?
---
All you can do solo is leave world, and click play again to join a world.  You won't know if it's the "same" server until you get in the game.
---
You can, once you've made some friends, join *their* world at will, which can be helpful if you have several friends and you are bouncing between their server's looking for specific enemies to kill, locations to loot, etc.
---
&gt; Is there end-game content?
---
Scorchbeast Queen is probably the most "end gamey", since she needs several well geared players to kill.  Other than that, launching nukes &amp; harvesting the nuke zone is 'next'.  And the all important loot grind.
---
&gt; Building protection?
---
Automatic turrets do 'ok' but won't really protect much.  Most structures are durable enough that enemies won't really destroy the base before you kill them.  You can lock doors &amp; resource production nodes if you want, too.
---
Thing is, there's not really a need to.  People can't really loot anything out of your base; and attacking other player structures flags you for PVP (which is broken as all hell &amp; annoying to deal with).  Most people just wanna wave at you, scrap junk, and throw stuff in the stash.
---
Building turrets and such is useful for defending workshops from waves of enemies, but that's about it.
---
&gt; Can someone destroy my base while I'm offline?
---
Nope - when you leave a world, your base leaves with you.
---
This also means that if you join a world and someone else already has their base near yours, it'll warn you it can't place your base (and ask to find a new world/server).
---
MOST other players still playing are pretty chill; they just wanna check your place, scrap some junk, stash some stuff, and carry on.  Not very many will go out of their way to attack player buildings (since that comes with hefty bounty).
---
&gt; RPG Elements?
---
There... aren't any, except for the game uses an EXP bar and some stat &amp; damage numbers, and armor values for combat math.  Most of the rest of it is looter shooter survival crafting;;  it's about as much of an RPG as Rust or 7 days to Die when it gets in to the gameplay.
---
There is a story; but it is told almost entirely through 3rd person style; passively, as you listen to holotapes, or read notes/terminals/etc.  The few NPC's you do find out in the wasteland are not human; vast majority of them are robots that (if friendly) will usually be a quest handout/reward NPC, and/or a vendor.
---
&gt; Can you join a guild?
---
Yes?  Not really in-game, though.  Unless you want to form a party with everyone wearing a specific outfit, but that's not too difficult to do.
---
As it stands, there is no in-game insignia or real 'support' for a guild.  At best it'd be a collection of friends that probably have some association through a discord or similar external (non-game) platform.
---
&gt; Can you join a faction?
---
The main story kind of follows you through various in-the-game-lore factions.  Raiders, Brotherhood, Enclave... with several rewards that fit the quests relevant to them.  Everyone that's been through the main quest is "a part of" the factions.
---
Repeatable quests for (some) of them do exist, and do reward more themed faction loot for them, which can include blueprints &amp; plans.
---
&gt; Can you set up a shop?
---
As of right now, in-game, about all you can do is run around with your voice chat on and find players to trade with.  There is no real good "mass communication" method to really spread the word that you are a shop or looking to trade, without depending on the voice chat.
---
Out-of-game, with some discords, other subreddits, etc., and trading is a lot easier, but involves a lot of adding/playing with friends list shenanigans, porting to other player's worlds, in between grinding sessions to find something maybe almost worth trying to advertise when people have mules full of legendary loot.
---
&gt; What else before buying?
---
For the $0-30 USD pricetag, it's a fun enough game to forgive it when it crashes and wastes a bunch of your time/effort.  Yeah it's a buggy mess; probably the "most buggy online game" available widely on several platforms.

If not a sale-price, and $60 full "AAA game" price, I'd say pass.  Those same faults you'd forgive a discounted game for, you'd be pissed at a "AAA" publisher doing.  Bugs and issues so glaringly obvious that it's a tough sell at that price point; other similarly priced games might have bugs or their own special issues, but no where near to the level seen in FO76.
---
On microtransactions:  they do exist, just in the "you buy these points; you can earn these points by playing the game or with real world cash".  Save the points, and just playing the game you'll get enough to afford your own power armor paints pretty easily; along with *most* of the other stuff you really want.  Add in daily/weekly stuff to supplement, and you can/should be able to get what you want out of the real-world-cash-shop without spending a dime on it.

BETHESDA PLEASE LET US BE CHEESEMONGERS.
---
Best idea I've heard in a lonnnng time.
---
Seriously, copper is my main need for ONE plasma thrower.  Couldn't imagine rocking two plasma weapons, I'd never retain ammo.
---
its not an exploit its just a.smart build..you could do the same if.you had the the right perks and equipment
---
I think we did it on a field trip to a dairy farm once. Get the Pam Poovey cred.
---
What platform are you on? PC?
---
Moleman City for the DLC as seen in the trailers. They also added Van Lowe Taxidermy and Arktos Pharma Biome Lab interiors that we haven't seen yet.
---
Except i can see that being the entire point, you have to either farm the base materials, or harvest from camp constructs, then brew, then age for vintage. Damn sight better than the civil war outfits, cloth to caps straight up. 
---
Not sure, yet. In terms of recipes, I mean. Just drinking it reduces rads and satisfies water needs, though.
---
Really rare outfits are those rewarded for completing quest and events, like Forest Camo Jumpsuit, BoS Jumpsuit, White Powder Jumpsuit, Whitespring Jumpsuit, Responders Fireman Outfit + Responder Fireman Helmet, Leather Coat, Tattered Field Jacket, Leather travelling Coat, Western Outfit, Western Outfit with chaps, Asylum Worker Outfits (especially Red, Yellow, Pink and Forest) and so on.
---
Damn, I got lucky because I had PA and kept falling non-stop.
---
Free content... If they want to do a new map they will have to charge people.
---
Yeah that's what I do since about a week but I don't get the plans I want, often duplicates. Is it random or do specific workshops offer specific plans?
---
Cryo has built in slow debuff, which is actually pretty good.  It has efficient ammo as well if put the crystalizer on it.  I actually have exploding legendary and its very good.   Flamers are decent for AoE healing as well.
---
I had three very different experiences (I‚Äôm on Xbox). 
---
All 3 involved nuking Fissure Site Prime. The first one Had about 16 players involved and by the time the clock ran out, she was 1/2 healthbar left (of her second and last bar). 
---
The second one had about 10 players involved. She only landed 3 times and by the time the clock ran out she had about 1/4 of her last health bar. 
---
The third was insane. About 12-15 players involved. She landed twice and the second time, she stayed on the ground until death. Here‚Äôs the kicker, she was DEAD with 23 minutes left on the clock. Seriously?
---
 Not sure what to make of it. 
---
That would be great! Are you on xbox? Is your Gamertag the same as your username here? :)
---
I love it. I put my camp near the brahmin spawn in Flatwoods and turned it into a raider bar that'll specialize in white russians. I call it The Hep C Factory. 
---
It's an energy weapon that does ballistic damage.  That doesn't mean it isn't an energy weapon, in a weird way, it's one of the best energy weapons because of this.
---
No? My Plasma Gatling did far far more damage than my handmade ever did.  I always used my handman on weak/normal mobs and saved the plasma for the larger ones.
---
I killed a 2* ghoul last night at the train yard that dropped a silver pocket watch only, so either the issue isn't completely fixed or there are "fake" legendary mobs out there.
---
Oh, to answer the OP‚Äôs question, the one time we killed her, her corpse was lootable without delay and got quest rewards like usual. 
---
2000.is not much..my friend gets his melee up to.7000..its not exploiting its just using the perks that the game gave us.
---
I started new questline, passed out drunk, woke up dunno where with Insult Bot nearby, got kicked out of the game (crash) amd was not able to find that place again.
---
If not for the fact I play multiple characters and multiple accounts I'd probably be pissed off I lost some of the new content. With this 'abuse' I can at least be sure I'll watch the quest through. 
---
You mean this 'vendorhopping' right? Maybe I should give it a try once
---
much like prize bot, he is looking for someone specific. I read earlier it gave someone a note. 
---
Nerd rage works for me. At 20% 283 damage without it, and 339 with it. BE 50cal.
---
It will be out on the 19th. Does anyone know if there's other items being added aside from masks and camp items?
---
Milk based products spoil fast when not cooled properly. We'd need a freezer first.
---
Exploit with perk cards lmao... 
---
It's called a build lol. We are all doing it. Should we all get banned too?
---
And when you get to the point of making a proper build, will you report yourself?
---
As for the dude, ye kind of douchy, but it has been said millions of times by now. Workshops are considered pvp territory, so you kind of misled your buddies.
---
You tamed something and it turned into that. Someone reported having a dif tame earlier and upon logging in after the patch it had changed to a ragstag
---
It's been give or take for me.  Some instasplode, some delaysplode, some nosplode.
---
I like the nosplodes.
---
Great idea 
---
I'm just here to give you at least 1 comment. 
---
Ok then that must be it, i tamed a deathclaw ages ago but it never got to my camp.
---
Did you get a recipe ? 
---
no i do randoms alot i posted about this earlier it is definitely new
---
When you upscale something gravity becomes more of a factor. If a normal bat doubled in size it's mass would be 8 times greater.
---
Now apply that to the size of the good old Sierra Bravo. They would probably collapse under their own weight much less fly.
---
But yeah, its Fallout so whatever! From a gameplay point if view just shotgun it's limbs? (Not tried personally)
---
I just got it, go to BIV and he starts a quest for you. It says you can do it multiple times so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs random. I just did my first one and it was the fresh whiskey/critical hit objective. 
---
No from Xbox. 
---
Lone, It would be great to hear if they are aware of the issue with energy resistances being un-affected by armor piercing. Until that gets addressed energy weapons will continue to be at a numerical disadvantage over ballistic weapons.
---
Roofless barn just doesn't have that "je ne sais quoi" that greenhouse does, though.
---
I'm guessing your on pc and I saw Bethesda tweet saying to fix this problem you have to restore the .ini files
---
Oh yeah forgot to answer haha, shes the reason im over encumbered, all was well killed the queen got the loot then I got DCed (nothing with the game my cats decided to chew the Ethernet cable) and now i cant go anywhere 
---
Hey u stop that
---
I had one where there was about 10 people and 6 of them hiding due to being quite low levels and just wanting loot and her health was on 50% when the time ran out, so we failed but she stayed there not attacking but we kept shooting until she was dead and still got all the loot from her body.
---
do u have the quest active?
---
Yeah that didnt work, did a complete re-install on one pc and just validated everything on another, the other minor bug I have (which prompted me to think to validate) is that im missing my dyes for pip boy and leather armor 
---
I just like the fact that you explore with your wife. Wholesome.
---
Could they possibly be a reward from the BIV quests. Not the main ones but the ones you can do multiple times? I only say that cuz I just got a plan for Greek letters set from one
---
What's the buffs on hard lemonade?
---
Anyone test it on Chally yet? Blow Grahm's mind with some milk of human kindness. 
---
I just like that you explore with your wife. That real wholesome.
---
Genuine question for everyone loving the game so much. As a huge Fallout fan I've slugged through the nightmare of the beta and launch and still occasionally play (and loved it initially) but what on earth are people doing to level up to 200-300? I'm about level 80 something now, I feel like it's just a repetition of going to White Springs, doing some daily/event that I've done 100 times before and maybe a bit of base building. I really want to be playing it but the monotony is killing me and I've honestly no idea what people are doing after the main quest is complete.
---
You can also find a civil war reenactor near the overseers camp, on your way to flatwoods on the other side of the road just past the truck &amp; concrete pile.
---
Noice. Now we just need to be able to set the codes from a terminal and I'd be completely happy.
---
So you are saying that my Heavy Weapons Guy build is finally doable?
---
Nice... I‚Äôll have to look into getting that one started up (and cleaning up achievements I missed from B.E.T.A testing on my current)
---
Did you get the free poster from the atom store. Place it in you camp and look at it to start the quest. 
---
Exact same problem here! This update has brought my old old old deathclaw back as a glowing radstag
---
There‚Äôs a mercinary group and traveling merchant dead outside watoga along the road that passes the main bridge near the Camilion death claw spawn at the electric transistor place 
---
&gt; je ne sais quoi
---
I learn a new word today....
---
Had same on all 3 silos . Charlie was highest wait with 240 hr cool down time wtf lol
---
Bethesda knows and is working on it. Sometimes still good to gamble, gotten a good piece from doing it and actually some other okay stuff. Seems like people are vendoring more 3s because of it?
---
Go back ad forth between Charleston Station and Summerville Dam. You'll encounter 2 Snallygaster and 2 Charleston Monster, that's 20+ Acid. Switch server and repeat.
---
They have an Atom shop logo on them, so I doubt they can be obtained from a quest.
---
I wouldnt worry, i couldnt tell you how many times ive gotten a message saying "reported" from some one mad. I hope you atleast had fun poking at him over it lmao if hed have done that to me id have made him sooooooo damn salty 
---
Shhh
---
The plan vendor in whitespring
---
I don't understand how this issue with uneconomical flamer fuel crafting is still present, the community has been extremely vocal about how resource-heavy it is to craft some ammo types in bulk.
---
Why you guys don't switch to shotgun with enforcer perk and shoot it down?
---
I would really like to know this as well.
---
That looks like the Enclave case dropping into Harpers from an event. 
---
If you are on pc, hit me up. I have tons of .308 I don‚Äôt use. 
---
.308 ammo is another ammo type that gives very little returns from bulk crafting, especially if you're crafting the rounds to use in the LMG.
---
You're doing God's work my friend
---
So....
---
you mark them with a pip
---
Contest their workshop
---
Fast travel to your pip
---
Find and Kill them
---
I'm actually gonna be able to use these outside of special circumstances now, so happy.
---
I can probably get by on one cryolator in a queen fight now too.
---
Definatly
---
.will chek it out
---
Energy damage is bad in FO4 as well (same code and issues) just mods made it bearable by heavily increasing energy damage as a workarround.
---
Headed straight to the golf club after install, first ghoul I see is. 3*. Rushed in and took him out, left me plasma cartridges and wonderglue.
---
???
---
They said this buff was coming way before, about heavy weapons in general. And even then, last weeks inside the vault specifically said that heavy weapons were getting buffed.
---
I did a B&amp;C last night, worked great
---
It's all random.
---
Easy way to do it, look out for someone putting up a post about civil war reenactor, go every time until you get the tophat plan. Then make tophats( only cost 1 cloth) depending on perks can be sold for about 30 caps each. Keep doing that &amp; just buy the plan, no more searching &amp; probably the easiest way to make caps
---
I can do it. On at about 8:00 am pst.
---
thanknyou for that one
---
Same here. 
---
I found a civil war guy in the south west corner of that dried up lake bed
---
ty
---
Yeah, it really is that easy. People assume, even if they see the "workshop contested" message, that you are waiting on them at the workshop. They never expect you to pop up beside them 10 seconds later with a charged crit headshot and drop them. I had to call this out, because even though I might have been using it for the right reasons, it has too much potential for abuse.
---
Thanks, I will take on board your recommendations for situational swapouts
---
Good to hear. Thanks. 
---
Cheers, thank god.
---
Decrease brightnessüòõüòõüòõ

&gt; **Foundations:** Addressed an issue that could allow players to stack Foundations under certain circumstances.
---
#You #Monsters!
---
Yeah, I got it and the quest is active, just when I come to the door it is inaccessible. 
---
Haha. Fair enough, thanks for the reply.
---
I woke up at the Alice and Wonderland easter egg. Felt very appropriate and somehow.... Sheogorathy
---
The scorchbeasts seem to be able to sonic attack quickly again, although this might have been down to server lag
---
Awesome. I was hoping that was the case but was worried I was looking on all the wrong places. Thanks man. 
---
Yeah he was probably referring to the new reporting system. Now everyone that look at your cool gear ,that took you 500 hours to get,will flag you as cheater,duper.  You kill someone in a game where pvp is permitted....cheater,griefer.
---
The team in charge of this will probably just have a bot trashcan every report in less than a week.

Totally lore breaking, game now unplayable.
---
The observatory in Savage Divide. Follow the train tracks East. Will be before the raider looking outpost pretty close to tracks. Another South West of Whitesprings North of uncanny caverns. Nearest the fissure. It's right off the side of the road there. Another if you take the road East from Jacks pumpkin house. Hard to miss in the middle of the road.  I've had CAMPS near these three and have seen all manner of encounters pop on them. Will check back to see if someone adds some I don't already know. Happy hunting. 
---
So it's a **new** random encounter?
---
To shreds you say?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm talking about the power armror paint job
---
yes been in the game since the beta
---
Since patch I cannot connect for more than 15 minutes, it just times out and shoots me to main menu. When I am connected during that brief period before timeout i am getting stutter lag like its day 1. Prior to the patch I had no problems outside the occasional issues like anyone else.  
---
 I dont see a point in making a post just to be down voted and spoken to like I'm pissing in everyone's cheerios for reporting my experience.
---
no its just selling things, no hopping. in video games you can sell things you pick up for in game currency
---
* How durable are weapons ? Is it like breath of the wild where they break after two hit ?
---
every weapon deteriorates at different rate, decs had made changes as well.
---
* How's the weight limit ? Decent or too restrictive ?
---
 from 400 to 800(currently) it is more than enough, it took some time to get used too, but its more than enough. keep and scrap material you want or need and sell everything else for caps. 
---
* How do server works ? Are they hosted by bethesda ? And once tou're on one, can you switch ?
---
dont know where de server are but I would guess so, yes you can switch servers oncce you are logged on
---
* Is there end game content ?
---
yes their is and more new content coming
---
* How does building protection work ? Can someone destroy my base while I'm offline or not here ?
---
once you are offline the base will be gone, if you are logged anyone can damage it. 
---
* What are the rpg elements? Can you join a guild, faction or something ? Can you set up a shop for instace ?
---
you can do that and more
---
And in general what should I know before buying, and also, what keeps you playing :)
---
the game is fun and what I like the most is the people that I find in game and I love helping newbies getting started on the right foot, I would say, you need to try the game to see if you like it and dont make conclusion based on the negativity thats out there.
---
the game still has buggs here and there but not as bad as everyone says, and I personly can see bethesda wonrking on the feedback we are giving and finally bringing out new content. 
---
thnx for the info..something new for me to.explore üòÉ
---
This isn't strictly a heavy guns thing, more energy weapons, but it relates enough to mention. I'm sure you've heard about it, but just in case.
---
Energy weapons don't seem to benefit at all from armor penetration.
---
Beyond the basic "my gatling laser's performance doesn't seem to benefit from stabilized" that applies to players, I think this applies to enemies too.
---
I've noticed that Gutsies using lasers are significantly less threatening than ballistic Gutsies. My theory is that laser Gutsies are supposed to have armor penetration, but it's broken for them in a similar fashion to how it is for players.
---
Either way, plz fix energy armor pen. I have this sweet explosive gatling laser and gatling plasma that I wanna more often, but they're just so much worse than my 50cal MG at the moment.
---
1st time, underneath the house that Sickle Man Was Here.
---
2nd time, in a neat cave underneath the road on the North end of the Cranberry Bog.
---
3rd time I can't remember but it was somewhere in the Ash Heap.
---
"they're fine except for how much they suck"
---
Yes.  You get the screen change again, and then when your drunk wears off you get Loading Screened.
---
Idiot.
---
I got sickleman's house 1st time.  Creepy for sure.
---
Kobe Brahmin! :P \~ \~ \~
---
A Good Time, by anyone's standards.  
---
You wake up in some weird-ass area of the map but you do so feeling well nourished and full of calcium.
---
Excellent. Thank you for this. :)
---
Well, let's see if shredder minigun build will be finally viable:-)
---
Such an awkward scene...
---
And you are going to the back door with the kegs and dumpster right next to it?
---
This. I spend most the SBQ battle wondering why there's only 2 other guys out of 10 firing a damn gun for 90% the fight. I mean c'mon! Just shoot anything at it while you're waiting!
---
Some people just have lower standards and are willing to put up with more. /shrug.
---
Yes. But very rare. 
---
Not sure if it's brand new, but when inspecting my own weapons/armor, the stats window is blank half the time. I have to keep going back and forth viewing details until it finally populates the information.  
---
Being gay does not suck, i agree to that. Neither it makes you special.
---
It is just a term as other terms are used in some industries to define something.
---
Nope. A friend launched last night. 
---
I very recently had a camp on the bridge right above the Morgantown sign (until the recent update evicted me!) and it was defended by missile turrets.
---
They shot into, over and around my camp ALL THE FRICKIN' TIME because of all the ghouls and apart from the CONSTANT NOISE I didn't seem to intercept any warheads with my face :D
---
P.S. - SORRY FOR THE CAPS, I AM PROFOUNDLY DEAF NOW. IT'S THE MISSILE TURRETS, YOU SEE.
---
To real XD
---
Holy crap, mind you it's only been a few days but still. 
---
Thanks. I will give it a go then 
---
Lol, I go to bed and wake up to two comments on the same comment 10 hours apart, am I still on your mind 10 hours later? I think you're taking this a little too personal bro.  
---
The hole you're digging is the fact that you can't post one sentence without insulting someone, it just makes you come off as an emotional jackass and just lets everyone know how toxic you are. Go complain in the Anthem subreddit instead, you'll fit right in.
---
That's bad :/
---
I am re-installing the game now, cleared everything related to 76 after uninstall. Dunno if it helps, but at least I've done everything I can.
---
are you a member?
---
* I hunt down straight jackets. 40+ caps each.
---
* I also sometimes craft outfits now. It breaks the monotony, but I don't have any of the high-earning ones. I think I get 10 or 11 caps from them. I don't do much with cloth, anyway.  
---
* Sell bulk oil or bulk fertilizer.  
---
You could also make an adhesive farm to sell bulk adhesive.
---
* The one thing I do most often is smack the vendors with a bunch of diluted Rad-X and other chems I don't use. IIRC, they weigh 0.05 for me, and I can produce plenty with Chemist and Super Duper.
---
No that‚Äôs 100% a thing, i have two of them above my store window and i have this ‚ÄúNuka Cola‚Äù that i originally thought was coming from the Nuka Cola Quantum Atom store sign but apparently not it‚Äôs those blinking lights
---
And yet you are the idiot who's only response is about a shovel because you still have no reading comprehension.
---
Here we go again...
---
I launched one last night...
---
I had the same problem on Xbox. Had to reinstall the whole game pre dlc patch and dlc. 
---
Not a big issue. As I was going to do so before the patch. A warning would have been nice. 
---
If so, I would expect it to be in the atom store in the near future. Otherwise, missed opportunity and all.
---
I'm glad the event works just fine for others. 
---
Sounds like you guys are looking for a non pvp game. It‚Äôs fine to not like pvp but weirdly you guys all bought a game with it in it.
---
Personally I consider this an abuse of the PvP mechanic.
---
Said that this has been known and used for quite some time and the devs have done nothing to curtail it - for reference foundation-built CAMPs have only become a bit 'on the nose' for the last three weeks or so and according to the latest patch notes it has already been patched out - so either is not really in widespread use, or at least not widespread enough to warrant fast tracking a patch, or is just fine to do so.
---
Either way it stands to reason that given the current mechanics one should only take over workshops either if prepared to be 'looking over one's shoulder' for the duration of the session (bare those marvellous occasions when one is the 'last man standing' in the server) or just baiting other players that think themselves with the 'high ground' because they go the offensive.
---
Farm white springs (even with xp nerf it gives out a decent amount), kill everything you see that is a decent level, events, workshops, misc quests. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve seen it done (I‚Äôm only 125 on my main but would be higher if I didn‚Äôt make alts to try different builds in the early game).
---
Fire rate should change the infobox, like the speedy receiver changes it as well on the gatling gun if you mod it.  Looks like your fire rate shows up so you're good, but the ammo is pretty high cost.
---
What do u mean? 
---
NMS is still considered by most of of the largest failures in gaming history. It recovered a little, but no one is trusting hello games with a project like that again. ESO had an MMO launch, ala bad... But has had 4 years of major content updates, ffxiv had a full rebuild. is fallout 76 going to get a full rebuild? Is it going to have 100hour expansion packs every 6 months? 
---
*Discretion
---
I feel the flamer just needs more fuel per craft, I use my vampires one occasionally, still very effective just can't use it much because of fuel.
---
Please buff laser rifles a bit more. They still break pretty quickly and their damage numbers are so bad they're not worth using in any scenario over a ballistic rifle.
---
Not really. It was a challenge a while back and they were freely available off a body in Berkeley Springs. 
---
Although now the switch does effectively nothing. Might as well just be a keypad if you need to enter the code every time to operate the switch.
---
They spawned in the asylum and also in some random unmarked trailer that I can't remember the location of. 
---
I found one in the &gt;!frathouse!&lt; in Morgantown last night, along with a vtu jacket.
---
It really do be like that sometimes 
---
A new one is if you inspect a weapon in your inventory the stats (damage, fire rate, etc) aren't displayed. The box they'd be in is blank.
---
Cheers for the spelling correction, yet another mistake by my phone's auto correct lol
---
Doesn't need a full rebuild; FFXIV was an outlier.  ESO had 4 years of major updates?  FO76 will have 4 years of major updates.  Count on it.
---
I will try that... I believe I heard there's about seven vendors you can sell to every 24 hours stuff worth 200 caps, right?
---
For every tale of a new player receiving gifts from a higher level... is a tale of a higher level chasing a poor new player around the map harassing them and scaring them while desperately trying to get them to look at the bag they keep dropping full of plans, ammo and a few legendaries that aren‚Äôt good for their build.
---
The criticisms dont fix the problems here. It should never have been released in its original state or current state. 
---
inb4 you get banned for going into dev vault.
---
My camp is in front of the door.  
---
Tea party location...all the hats were gone.
---
If you're teamed it's even easier than that. One person travels to, and trails the target. Another sits patiently at the shop and starts the claim process when their partner is in position. The former takes the shot and kills the unsuspecting shop owner. 
---
If you suspect someone is teamed with the shop owner a third person on the team can trail them as well.
---
It is the mutation, had it on one off my characters, just gave up with the brahmin on that character.
---
Within your comment you are referring to the particular place where I got mine from. Cool to know anyway, thanks!
---
It's the door on the picture, the only door. I see many players around, probably having the same problem as I. 
---
Thank you for coming to my post and providing an answer to the question. Have a nice day! 
---
Interesting, never seen one before. Thank you for this insight, have a nice day!
---
It's a great time to be a 76 fan.
---
Then new quest wasn't even broken! Mechanically anyhow. Double unarmed damage seems pretty broken. Hopefully the other nukashine recipes are variants that affect rifles, heavy guns etc
---
Ryzen 3 is for Office / Multimedia use and not for gaming, get the Ryzen 5 2600 instead. the gpu should be enough for this game, i personaly would go for that 1070 or better yet a 1660ti.
---
It all depends on how much money you are willing to spend.
---
Feels like a beta, plays like a beta, looks like an eight year old beta.
---
Its on a decade old engine (yes its the engine of Skyrim, and yo ucan really tell) which hasnt seen much, if any, modernisation except the switch to 64bit. 
---
They have released a AAA title, with a AAA price tag, and put minimum effort/investment into it. And yet people are happy to defend this catastrophic failure.   
---
I agree with the OP, the community can be brilliant. But the die-hards who defend FO76 as if its a GOTY contender are just deluded fanatics. 
---
People seem to come back? Loading time increases significantly. 
---
You would only notice the cooldown if you launched more than one
---
At no point in time this game was a bad game. People saying otherwise know shit and their opinion is worthless, sry for harsh words but these trolls shouldn't be considered partners in dispute whose feelings could be hurt. Fuck em hard. Obviously, the game is still full of issues, bugs and glitches, but I honestly doubt any intellectual capabilities of these brickheads that ever gave it 0/10.
---
The perk just makes the effects of hunger and thirst less! They don't slow the meter down. 
---
I feel like this quest is broken from the update or something. Because last time I did it was Tuesday and I didn't do it yesterday and now its Thursday and going to the park doesn't prompt the daily anymore, sigh never going get that outfit set.
---
Found this also Vault 96 I believe.
---
i am too, and the loading times was the only reason I put that game down, I have tried and every time the loading times kills it for me.
---
You can directly counter this by simply remaining in sneak mode all the time you have a workshop in your possession, but if you go back to your CAMP and stand to use a crafting table or come out of sneak mode for any other reason and get seen on the map, you can have this trick used against you. I haven't had it used against me yet because I know about it and spend almost all my time in sneak mode to begin with, but I think it's going to get used more until it becomes a problem for those who don't know and especially employed predatory junk thieves or trolls.
---
The link is a 404
---
That's my guess. Tons of people upset over PvP THEY initiated will start reporting the victors.

Had one guy before this patch attack a teammate at Whitesprings.  He and his team couldn't kill us, and we just kept mowing them down every time they came back for me. He eventually got on area chat and said he'd grab hold of me like he grabs his son!  LOL. Ok man, admit to child abuse and give a real world threat in one go just because you're upset you got beat in a fight you started?  
---
Which is why I think it borders on abuse, and may need attention. I never even thought of the team angle till now. Just one more reason to take a look at it.
---
I sell chems, food and drink, as I have two armor pieces reducing the weight. Also, legendaries if I've been farming for stuff. Someone should make a weight / value analysis :-)
---
I've been in the event twice when this has happened. No scorched earth rewards but we did get to kill and loot the queen.
---
Hover over the challenge and the details will open to the right. It's a series of tasks that need to be completed, all involving alcohol.
---
It was Advanced darkness...
---
But yes, they absolutely did because there were alot of complaints about it on reddit. 
---
Needs more nuclear material.
---
I think they always drop "legendaries" now, it's just that drills and syringes are considered legendary too.
---
I thought bottling and distribution was all automated so product was still being distributed post-bombs and that was the explanation why the vending machines were still stocked after 200 years. Or I could just be making that up in my head.
---
Thanks! will try later.
---
Actually it very likely would be.  Vault 96, 94 and 63 all had stuff in them.  They were not finished though.  I've been through all of those.  But now there is something blocking just behind those vault doors.  That definitely implies a posibility of something new!
---
I would have welcomed this change had it come during or after the supposed future changes to pacifist mode. Owell, shit happens.
---
Getting pissed (drunk) off your head .
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue! I‚Äôve even read the poster by the door and it still says available at a later date.
---
This is the one I use, I use all mutations besides bird bones, egghead and empath.

---
This is the wrong door. You need to go in through the backdoor. It's a metallic door.
---
I don't have a problem with it either.  Its nice to know they are actually thinking about these things though. 
---
This is the wrong door. You need to go in through the backdoor. It's a metallic door
---
That sounds like too much hassle to me.
---
This may not apply to everyone but if I would really want to take over a workshop so badly - since the ~~nerf~~ 'rebalance' I have done much better finding resources elsewhere bare a couple of things - I would use a capless/partyless/junkless alt.
---
That way I get to decide, not the devs or other people, whether someone can have their fun at the expense of mine or not.
---
It's a melee weapon with an "Oh s**t button".
---
Ahhhh....thank you. Ive never even used that holotape ...obviously...and ive always had it.
---
I did the daily to get a recipe, and upon completion the rewards was 1 Rad Ant Lager.
---
So server hopping camden park you can farm the daily multiple times a day? Because I fast travelled their today and yesterday and haven't gotten the quest unlike in the past I would get it every 24hrs.
---
Yeah you get it when you finish an enclave quest but it doesn‚Äôt notify you about it really I found it in my inventory one day after thinking about buying a new one lol.
---
There is a visual bug with the class freak perk not updating mutation effects in the pip boy.
---
I ended up at Fort McClintock.
---
You did misspell your username, Dairy\_Interest.
---
I mean even with the pacifist change you can still do it with people who want to participate, they just have to turn off pacifist. The only difference is now you can't force people to participate anymore by threatening them. Sure I get it, it's part of the roleplay and I sure would play along if you showed up but not everyone wants to play that way.
---
&gt;Vintage Nukashine and I can tell this is going to be extremely OP.
---
I‚Äôm sure the blacking out and waking up in a random map location offsets the 100% bonus to unarmed damage and 50% AP regen, even when tripled with perks.
---
Griefers are the ACTUAL worst. 
---
I'm level 45 and I'm at the end of the main quest story and ready to launch a nuke. 
---
So I went to site Alpha yesterday and I'm so close to the end of the quest (I've saved up my ammo, my stimpaks, bobble heads, chems etc for this very frigging moment) and some level 250+ and their mate decides to use their one shot kill on me and my teammate. Going back through the whole compound after respawning was fruitless as they just did it again whenever we got close. 
---
I know it isn't against any rules and definitely isn't bannable, but it's just *annoying*, especially when you're a lower level and you've worked hard to get where you are. 
---
Is it a good time to buy the game? 
---
I have a OP supersledge but it only does around 200 damage. Even with all 3 slugger cards maxed out. While my all rise does around 300..... is this a bug?
---
The dragon is a unique version of the black powder rifle that does more damage but takes like 5 seconds to reload and can only chamber 1 round. You can get legendary modifiers on the dragon just like a normal gun, it just has a fancy name.
---
Agreed, it seems to be strange in numbers that's screwed.   Also, did speed demon get nerfed? I don't seem to move as fast as I did before the update yesterday.
---
Even without mods, having the custom ini file causes the issues.  
---
For me the ‚Äòbug‚Äô (my own error) was that when I did the quest for the second time around on a new character I didn‚Äôt press the first button.
---
There‚Äôs a little countdown for it to actually start, me knowing the ropes just ran up to the button and blindly followed the course, just to find out the quest wouldn‚Äôt finish on the last button press :)
---
Major expansions, not a single vault. Entire zones every 6 months. .. . If F76 can manage that it might resurrect it. Heres hoping for Bethesdas sake.
---
I don't have that, I even deleted and reinstalled everything. 
---
The fact that you can‚Äôt do anything (change gears, skills, check stats and challenges) while in the loading screen kills it. Destiny really looking top tier MMOish console shooter after division, FO76 and anthem release.
---
Which would kill workshops, imo. They are already mostly dead, truth be told, except for new players or the uninformed using them, and PVP bait. But like I said I want community opinion and to see what everyone thinks about this first before I go off making a decision about it. Thanks for your input! :)
---
But if the only PvP you want to do is hunt bounties then how is that any different than Adventure mode? No I‚Äôm sorry but I didn‚Äôt wait 4 months for that lol, hopefully BGS listens to the real PvP players and makes this game mode rewarding and intense, and hunting bounties just doesn‚Äôt do it for me. 
---
Honestly you just described Adventure mode so maybe you should just stick with that idk. 
---
What is the difference between potted plants and picked up teddybears? If I want I can fill my whole camp full with potted plants. So I don't see what changing the object models change about server stability!?
---
From the last patch, when mods and custom ini files messed up the atom shop textures, uninstall/ reinstall did not correct it.  The users had to hunt down and manually fix the files even if they were not actively using any mods.  
---
yup, frequent crashes are back again on xbox.  Also, enemies are wrecking me for a solid 15-20 seconds before I can even see them after spawning in or fast traveling, which kind of sucks if you're running a bloodied build. 
---
I haven't seen that yet, still a fair bit to explore it seems :3
---
What platform are you on?
---
All the more fun! 
---
True but it'll make it a tad bit deadly Lol, monster energy is the closest equilvent I could think of and it's still poison lol
---
I have not installed any mods or edit/create any custom uni file at all for this game...
---
No U
---
Bruh now I can atleast shoot 1 full core with my prime TSE gatling plasma
---
I just find the 'I am going to have my fun at your expense and you have to be OK with that because (((The Man))) says so' mindset a peculiar one.
---
I'm sure they'll somehow make it without your undying devotion. ;-)
---
totally agree it was never a 0/10. 3/10 maybe... bad comparitively - but reasonably playable on it's own for a time. 
---
It had a LONG way to go and the rough start was a lot worse than most people expected (and those that did expect it didn't buy it). They let a lot of people down at the starting line, and that's likely more expectations + disappointment + rough start = harsher than warranted reviews.  
---
The one massive upside - even if all the old stuff was negative it just means the people felt invested. They cared. I'd rather see a lot of bad news than no news at all... at least then there's a chance for this kind of change.  
---
I'm just incredibly happy it's turning around! :)
---
I think there definitely was some flak and criticism that was deserved. The game did release in a buggy state, and security flaws were a major issue initially. Thankfully enough Bethesda was able to make the best of a rough start and turn things around. The game is flawed but I love it, I always wanted a co-op Fallout experience, and be able to immerse myself in the world and lore with friends. Hopefully Wild Appalachia continues to be a huge step in the right direction for the game! If Zenimax could turn things around for ESO, I'm sure Bethesda can for FO76.
---
100 damage **per shot**??
---
And it fires that fast?
---
Fuck, might need to change my build into heavy weapons...
---
Skins glorious skins! Any as a handmade user, this is doubly exciting.
---
now regretting impulse buying the new WV paint job :( when the excavator paint is coming!!!
---
Find a junk deposit that should help 2 spots very west side of map by deathclaw island
---
Two whole days after I scrapped mine &gt;_&lt;
---
Getting adhesive is pretty easy for me. Just plant a minimum of 2 tato, 2 corn, and 2 Mutfruit plants outside your C.A.M.P. harvest them, and cook them to make vegetable starch which you can scrap to make adhesive. The plants seem to respawn pretty quickly. So you can constantly make it over and over, as long as you have wood to cook with.
---
Don't my man, it's a limb crippler, hardly a killing gun.
---
I recently tested an experimental mirv aka daisycutter and a two shot 3 star fatman with 40% bash damage and 15% vats crit meter fill rate.
---
The mirv consistently blew up in my face killing me.
---
The 3 star two shot fatman couldn't kill a lvl 1 mirelurk hatchling with a bash attack (even with +40% bash damage).
---
And a two shot fatman only managed 1/10th of a lvl 91 glowing deathclaws health, the mirv did less.
---
But it should cripple limbs really fast...
---
When you go to repair your weapons and the list of required materials shows up you can choose to ‚Äòtoggle for search‚Äô this means that any junk items you come across that contain screws, adhesive and springs will have a little magnifying glass beside the item name so you can max your carry weight with those items. As for ammo you can either farm scorched or super mutant locations, bolt gun ammo is probably the most common type, alternatively you can get lead and gunpowder and craft your own at a tinkers workbench
---
I found mine in fort defiance. Have cleared that place numerous times. Have only seen it once. 
---
It's good, but I still wish it was longer. With losing a huge investment in workshops on the line, I'm really worried about leaving for more than a few minutes. Although, I have lost expensive workshops to crashes more than anything else.
---
Yay!  Outrage!
---
No Bethesda patch would be good if there wasn't something to be outraged about!  To your youtube channels!
---
In regard to Adhesive, I would suggest building an adhesive farm at your camp (corn, mutfruit, tato, and purified water). And, in regards to the ammo, I would just suggest crafting it at a Tinkerer's Workbench as gunpowder is probably one of the most common items in this game. 
---
And, you can usually find some desk fans in the military wing in the Whitespring Bunker which you can scrap for screws, it's not a lot but it's not bad.
---
apparently speed demon got buffed
---
Sounds like a good idea, cities and all. I‚Äôm def gonna have to move to get foot traffic. I‚Äôm currently to the north of the Christmas tree, off the cliff between it and the twin lakes.
---
Well, killing people it's a job, and it has to pay.  
---
If you have to fast travel to a workshop (usually about 15/20 caps) and claim it (25/40 caps) to kill a level 20 guy and earn this way 20 caps (10 if you are in a squad with a friend), you are doing something wrong.
---
Some trolls may do this only for fun even if it means losing caps, but if I am hunting people, I'm going after high levels.  
---
I can confirm stealth is still bugged in various ways, most notably, pulling out a weapon while looking at an enemy will instantly alert them of your presence.
---
hmm, I should be moving faster then, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
---
2.8k downvotes from people who have never touched the game probably. Glad the trailer is getting positive reception though! Super keen to play some of the Wild Appalachia content once my update finishes later tonight.
---
I feel like there should be a consequence for making a false report like a three day suspension for being a jackass/moron with the explanation that they need to know what they are reporting before wasting everyone's time. 
---
You mean harizma perk when you're staying in camp?
---
yeh a lot of things arr broken
---
True, it's a amazing feeling haha. Just not always a convenient fight.
---
So here‚Äôs another suggestion for you: have that character learn every weapon mod by building and scrapping every gun repeatedly. It will consume a great deal of scrap that you‚Äôd be destroying anyway. Then you can use that character to buff any weapons for anyone in the future. 
---
I still have a cool off period 220 hours. This game drives me crazy. 
---
Pick up Giddyups, Typewriters, Adjustable Wrenches. Screws and Gears.
---
Plant corn, mutfruit, tatos and have a water purifier. 2 each of the crops and 1 water gives you vegetable starch. Scrap that, Adhesive.
---
Pick up wonderglue, duct tape, handmade glue. That stuff is in a lot of places. Not in extreme amounts but more then enough. Scrap that, more Adhesive.
---
Run the Big Bent Tunnel or any location with a high enemy encounter rate. Pick up all the weapons from their corpses, drag yourself to the nearest workbench, scrap them, Steel.
---
Farm Super Mutants for Gunpowder, more weapons and caps.
---
Clear the Hornwright Estate Gym, the Lucky Hole Mine, the Charleston Firestation and the Pententiary. Tons of lead.
---
Lead, steel, gunpowder -&gt; Ammo
---
If you run out of gunpowder, pick up any pre war money and nuka cups, pizza trays, etc. and scrap that stuff for Cloth.
---
Cloth and steel -&gt; Gunpowder.
---
Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator PA and you're set on tons of lead ore. You'll need Acid to smelt that, so make sure you pick up any coolant, abraxo and makeshift battery.
---
I think you should make a youtube video about this, you seem to have the right attitude.
---
The barn, next to Charlston Station is also one. Hosting the infamous Vendor Bot Responder.
---
I never find the uniforms, just the hats in all the colours. 
---
266 hour cool of period in the silos for me
---
definitely agree. monster makes your piss glow = nuclear material. great recipe man, think i'll try it this weekend too! thanks!
---
Yeah, Westek has quite a few crafting tables tables to scrap as well luckily. Harpers ferry is jam packed with mutants as well if they spawn, enjoy hehe
---
ahh yes..i know that one well
---
.thnx i forgot to mention him
---
Yeah. I was so glad that was still working. I have everything up in the air to avoid damage. 
---
aaaaand I'm coming back now.
---
Thanks for this post &lt;3
---
Sucks that it happened to you; I harbour no ill will towards you nor I derive any pleasure from your misfortune but may I ask, did you expect anything different?
---
If all one needed was a death to unload everything on the ground and let it be carrion for the vultures - so to speak - it kind of defeats the object.
---
I am surprised that a different loophole was left in if some player accounts are to be believed given that one of the statrd reasons was 'to prevent unsuspecting passers by from unknowingly picking up the spoils'.
---
You could set up your camp just outside of Flatwoods and help out the lower level players who just stepped out of the vault, or Morgantown would be a good location for this too. 
---
As well, just outside of the Whitespring Resort would be a good area as that location gets a lot of foot traffic.
---
Big leap of faith guessing a vault is an underground location!
---
I believe I ran into him at valley galleria today.
---
Leather Coat. Nothing else comes close (I have it also lol)
---
That‚Äôs fair. 
---
They're all at r/anthemthegame
---
it just works
---
Yeah but in the end junk weighs the least, but oh well, you can always get more junk.
---
Glad i stored all the most important like screws and springs in stash
---
Hunters coat and drifters coat too, apparently. I have both, but don‚Äôt getting bored with them so looking for a new look.. 
---
Bruh, if I *ever* stumbled across something that beautiful, I would drown you in caps lmao I love this idea.
---
What‚Äôs your GT
---
üòÇ
---
While this is helpfull, it's also a shame we need to utilize glitches for something that planters are supposed to be used for. Planters that actually already are within the game.
---
Let me ask the question. Thanks for letting me know codexiac
---
Still basically useless then: It's not like wood or steel are hard to get.
---
Sorry if that may be obvious but i genuinely don't known what uniform and stairs you guys are talking about. What exactly was fixed? 
---
Glad you posted this because I had this sequence of events happen and got confused when I saw the Nukashine in my stash. Almost removed it. 
---
Im interested, GT is Pray4Chanka
---
It seems odd with how common addictol is in the game.  Makes junkie's stuff a tad pointless as well.  I do kinda prefer not having what seemed like a 25% chance from fo4 though, without settlement doctors it would get annoying quick.
---
They aren‚Äôt rare, they‚Äôre fairly common, esp drifters
---
**tl;dr** It's before the Mothman poster in the CAMP build menu.
---
I had trouble finding it myself. Do this:
---
* Go in you C.A.M.P. build menu.
---
* Go to Wall decoration.
---
* Go to the locked Mothman poster.
---
* Toggle items to the left.
---
Awesome, thank you. Need to keep going back I guess
---
I had a bunch of flux and i don't think my weight changed.
---
When random players try to trade with you it‚Äôs clear that they‚Äôre only doing it so they can see what armour and guns you have so they know if you‚Äôll be easy gains or not.
---
üê∏
---
It's just buyers remorse lmao
---
I stand corrected.
---
Agreed, until those will be introduced (if ever), some glitches don't need fixing imo. With the lack of some CAMP items, these glitches don't hurt anyone and at least they improve the possibilities / our creativity. 
---
Its apparently changed since the update. There appears to be a timer on each area. loading into the area alone wont trigger respawn anymore. At least thats what my initial testing is telling me.
---
&gt;Hope this helps some of you! If it's unclear I'll try to put up a little video showing it. 
---
I did video for this a little while ago actually. Great way to make an indoor/rooftop garden!: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEEccVdwnko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEEccVdwnko)
---
doesn't solve the issue of doing a vendor run and forgetting your loot in your stash or needing to grab some junk to sell, unless you don't mind multiple loading screens to run to a stash. 
---
You speak in a strangely biblical fashion and I adore it.
---
Yeah, mine only went down by 5 pounds.   Must be something else
---
I'm on Xbox.
---
Happy that it wasn't a total loss too.
---
Do you already have Travelling Pharmacy and Thru-Hiker rank 3 equipped?
---
If you don't I can attest that is possible to level up enough to acquire and equip these using a grossly over-encumbered mule and end up 'within the limit'.
---
As a matter of fact I ended up lvling up this one mule ladden with almost 10k lbs enough to acquire rank 3 Travelling Pharmacy, Pack Rat and Thru-Hiker and end within the newly imposed limits without having to delete anything.
---
It was a close call many times but I just took it as a challenge. Having come from almost 10 years of playing exclusively single player games I am starting to find dealing with a 'higher authority' constantly breating down my neck what is and what isn't and under what circumstances... difficult.
---
Let us know how it goes on here just in case I don't get chance to try it myself lol
---
I am so glad...I don't know how many times I have accidentally walked over them while creeping around peaking in people's windows...

Fort Defiance. Brotherhood quests take you there. There‚Äôs a rare spawn of colored uniforms in there people collect. 
---
Mine reads on the map, taken over by feral ghouls. But the notifcation was about Sheepsquatches. As I had some disputes with two players about the ownership of one workshop I didn't feel like going there to clear it.
---
bomber jacket.  NOT the atom shop one.
---
You can also drink Nuka Grape, that removes radiation and doesn't affect your mutations. Buy them from the nuka vendor at Whitesprings. 
---
Wait the (spoilers) nuke cola machine door? I would love that
---
Yeah I have all the hats but they're the only 2 outfits. And they're there every time lol
---
Oh bugger - that Corvega skin is a thing of beauty. And the handmade skins... and the prepper stuff... and... and... How much is it to buy Atoms again? T\_T
---
I think you character is bugged... Had it to on the pc version... 
---
Two people tried to trade with me yesterday and I declined. Both of them were attacking me at the same time, they were in a group supposedly, and were not doing damage because of the healing mutation and me not activating pvp. I honestly don‚Äôt understand why people would try to attack after people refuse to trade or buy things from them. 
---
Subjective I guess. I have 300+ of any material, and I'm not farming that much, just grabbing anything that contains aluminium, spring, screws or lead.
---
Ammos ont the other hand are lead/steel eaters tho.
---
You must be some sort of sheldon and detecting sarcasm isnt your strong point.

---
Thank you. 
---
Well seems like it's a big secret. 
---
Cause I'm not a shotgun lad :(
---
By the time some of the bugs was fixed I had already noticed how boring the game is. New fallout paint wore off once all there was to do after the pointless quest was to grind away at farming stuff just to do the useless repeatable quest. I loaded it up a few weeks ago and ran around for a few hours and it was a boring slog. 1000+ hours in fallout 3 ,4 and 300 in new vegas and about 500 in skyrim still to this day those games don't make me feel that way.
---
Not rare man, you‚Äôll get it if you do enough technical data quests, quite a common reward
---
Got you covered on Xbox. Thecrimsondon.
---
PS4 here. I had an extra plan I would have traded or given you. 
---
It seemed so. Start from a different area.
---
As i said i have no clue how that works. Maybe i was just playing when the "day" resets.
---
Not op, but this is the spot. From [Watoga Transit Hub, past the Civic Center board going to Defiance](https://i.imgur.com/84U8JlM.png). [Left on the corner.](https://i.imgur.com/cyoygc7.png). [Exact spot from OP's perspective.](https://i.imgur.com/amEpBNf.png)
---
I also have the same problem 200+ hours 
---
u still have it man ? PS4?
---
Out of curiosity did it seem like the bots were spawning at an insanely fast pace for you as well or was that just my server?
---
Really, I just can't believe how much more freedom with these things the new budget offers. Thank you, guys and girls of Bethesda for doing this!
---
It‚Äôs not an emote you jackass, it‚Äôs an emoji used by preteen dweebs
---
I played BETA, and stuck around for a few updates, but me and my best friend burned through the content and there's no endgame content currently to keep us to suffer through the stupid Scorchbeast attacks. The tediousness is ad nauseam, so my best friend and I are gonna wait a year and come back and see if they did a No Man's Sky.
---
in 450+ hours of questing.....seen it once.  so it is rare to me.
---
It's going to be the Tattered Field Jacket or the Leather Coat
---
Cool man, it‚Äôs a good costume
---
I'm two months late....but I have this too.
---
Whenever the game starts crashing (PC) using the scan and repair option fixes it for me.
---
being able to not give away you are in the menu is important to me, I don't want to be forced to always tell people when I am in my inventory.
---
Been doing this since yesterday, loads of players on all platforms are having issues. Myself included, it‚Äôs odd since there‚Äôs alot of people out there who can still launch.
---
Only Bethesda know why certain accounts have nuke privilages....
---
Yeah. More robots than there‚Äôs ever been!

For me, giving the same bonus for chairs as well was the true genius move. At least beds served some other purpose. Now chairs do too.

Now, if only they'd slowed down metabolism while seated or sleeping to give people real incentive to take a seat while chilling, chatting or taking a toilet or lunch break.
---
Look. I‚Äôll admit that I expressed my opinion in a way that made me out to be an asshole. But at the time I had just finished downloading an update I was hopeful would fix server stability as well as other issues. While some were fixed most were not. I‚Äôm a passionate fallout fan and when they make a game that I can hardly play due to end game bugs it‚Äôs absolutely infuriating. Then you have the plethora of threads after every update praising Bethesda for essentially something they haven‚Äôt even played long enough to have an opinion about.
---
Those give it?  The past 10 times I've gotten ammo and stimpaks - nothing else
---
Yeah, fairly often, just luck I guess
---
If you‚Äôve ever played dying light you know how dark the nights are in the game. It becomes pitch black when it starts raining to. Couple that with spoopy zombies it‚Äôs basically a horror movie 
---
ive been trying to get all the data from enclave bunker - so like 3 or 4 at a time, to see if that makes a difference and it gives me shit.
---
will keep plugging away!
---
I was gutted when I had this message. Had my camp on the cliffs by the lighthouse since beta. Didn‚Äôt relocate my camp though so maybe if it‚Äôs bugged as some has said then I might get it back next time I log back in.
---
When you get to the quest step where you have to gather ingredients, don't do what I did; Gather the perishable items LAST. Felt like banging my head against the wall when I got back to the quest NPC on the next-to-last step, and I had spoiled ex-ingredients instead of sweet, sweet liquor.
---
My mods broke that too!
---
In my experience, it makes zero difference if it‚Äôs 1 or 10, you never know for sure though!
---
I believe it's perfect, can't see myself ever needing more.
---
any shielded underamor plans thats not BOS?
---
You just need normal wine,  try the vendors at train stations if you can‚Äôt find any lying around. 
---
Were  you able to fix it ?
---
Ahem, the holotapes
---
Is this furniture entry is blocked message an attempt by Bethesda to stop people from entering a building by activating a crafting table through a window? That's the only logical reason I can come up for that error message. Still waiting for internet service in our new house, so can't play at the moment, but I would love to test this out.

Nerd rage is working for me, they just buffer either adrenal reaction, bloodied, or both.

They don't want to trade, they want to see your stuff to see if you have scrap to drop and/or if your stuff will make their gank easy or not.
---
You wanna see crazy?! I'm replying to an **8**-hour old comment!
---
I would like to play with others, but i dont really have any friends who are into fallout, they mostly play fifa, apex and other types of "mainstream" games. So that would be hard for me to do. Do you know of any forum or subreddit where i can locate people to play with?
---
That sounds like my load out.

The hero I needed but not quite the one I wanted.
---
Marsupial with Strange in Numbers might as well be rocket jumping 
---
I live in Germany and here I got the game for free by buying a PS4 Controller. Try finding some offer like this. The game sure isn't worth full price. But 20 bucks is okay. 
---
You wont have trouble finding people to play with. In my experience most people are very friendly and I have not played a session without someone inviting me to a group.
---
I'll let the team know this now. Thanks mate
---
Your a fan of the nuka , I can get you some nuka cola t-51b paint plans if your on Xbox!
---
It's actually worse than this. If you challenge the workshop very quickly and then back out, it flags the owner as in PvP to you for quite a while, but you are not flagged as in PvP to them. Had this happen 3x last night and nothing we could do about it since we could only do slap to them. Surely this particular instance counts as cheating/exploits.
---
I'm guessing you need to have empty buckets in your inventory? Would be pretty OP if you can do this endlessly.
---
That only applies for people with pacifist already on. I always play with it off as do 90% of the other people I play with, and the people who have it on probably wouldn't want to participate anyway. You could always start up the same thing in Survival but it would be much harder considering people will probably shoot on sight unless you have guards.
---
Beautiful work!
---
I found one on the ledge above the Hapers Ferry vendor
---
Yeap, more robots.
---
Interesting dude 
---
I think they fixed that in Patch 7
---
I noticed this last night. I thought I was just losing track of time. I don‚Äôt remember anything about spoilage in the patch notes though. 
---
Please correct me if I'm wrong as I may be misunderstanding this. 
---
What your saying is this will occur if I have something actively fermenting and for some reason decide to server hop. 
---
But if I stay on the same map I'll be ok?
---
Deez‚Äôs nuts!
---
Don‚Äôt worry. The only way you can be banned on Xbox is if you have a inappropriate gamer pic or send bad messages. The worst thing to happen is your rep going down. That‚Äôs not to bad though
---
Seen a few people mention this. Will share this feedback with the devs. Thank you Wrackoon!
---
Yeah i got the same, we cant nuke for 10 days xD
---
Im sure its just a bug which will be fixed soon.
---
Well done all around.
---
We shall go to the forum and cry like little bitches.
---
\#GamersRiseUp! /s
---
I just noticed it after the patch. My food shouldn't spoil in five minutes. 
---
Sorry, I was grumpy and frustrated when I replied before.  As far as I can tell, my other games work just fine.
---
Well, Star Trek Online was always a tad buggy, and I've had that longer than Fallout.
---
there's a White Russian drink
---
Yeah the empty legendary loot is not fixed. F. WTF is up with all the level 35/40 loot from maxed level ghouls at White Springs? I had that before this patch too. 
---
oh my god plz new unarmed weapons
---
I want the nuka cola lamp that turnssssss!
---
Stealth nerf perhaps?
---
Every time I hear it I can't decipher what he's singing. xD
---
I know the theory of the math but we‚Äôre talking about 5 shots to kill a level 68 super mutant rather than 6 shots. That‚Äôs not the epic power people are imaging. Anti-armor or instigating also shave one shot off each enemy and don‚Äôt destroy your hip fire accuracy or risk killing you self with point blank shots. 
---
I‚Äôm glad they nerfed TSE but the two shot portion really isn‚Äôt out of range anymore. Explosive is the best suffix but does at least also add enormous risk for the user. 
---
Oh it is fine man I had to uninstall the game because it was making all my other games not run smoothly
---
Yeah they glow in the dark. I just noticed and started wandering if that had always been the case.
---
Yeah seems the fermenter inventory is tied to the stash. I found my fermenting beer and wine in there and I thought "that's weird but better not touch anything..."
---
For the first time in weeks, I was actually able to place a couple of turrets.  Much much better!
---
Already up to Level 180. Whitesprings and WeatTek do it every time. ;)
---
Same. I usually hit West Tek and Whitesprings and then go back to my camp and cook all my glowing meats. Last night I kept having spoiled meat. Almost seems like they doubled the decay timer. Maybe unintentional bug?
---
Pc specs?
---
Whitesprings still has camps so feel free to let them know how you feel. I like feel with a supersledge and mini nukes
---
How did they nerf raw flux? I haven‚Äôt been in a nuke zone since the patch. 
---
I haven't claimed a Workshop in quite some time, but it did not inform you that you would be placed in PvP mode before, that was added if it tells you that now.
---
I was evicted from my Camp on the monorail in Morgantown by the update T\_T  
---
I have moved camp about once a week since Beta and it was my favourite by far. Might have to move back up and reopen my Luxury Glamping Resort by Deathclaw Island again :)
---
Vendors and player trade works differently. You've never been able to do it in player trade but you used to be able to inspect with X when buying from vendor. Sometimes players sell their legendaries tovendors and you want to buy them.
---
This is how i get all my caps!
---
Those are two different perks.
---
FO4 crashed on a regular bases for me. So did the oh so beloved FONV. Not saying this should be normal and accepted. 
---
Are you telling me I can finally bear arms?
---
Yeah lol. Sorry about that. I was in bed when I saw this post.
---
Here's my album. I can also pay caps if you don't see anything you like.

I have a forest Asylum uniform, and I heard those are hard to get.. at one point, they were selling on the markets from 15-25K caps.
---
Here's SOME rare apparel, that has been selling for top dollar on the markets:
---
Cowboy outfit with chaps
---
different color asylum uniforms (red, forest, pink, yellow, brown, blue, green)
---
Leather coat
---
VTU jacket &amp; jeans
---
forest and urban jumpsuit
---
Whitespring jumpsuit
---
BOS jumpsuit
---
White Powder jumpsuit
---
etc..
---
This is not the full list. Now, unfortunately, the value and rarity has decreased on many of these, due to duping exploits that caused some of these to flood the markets.

DefWon  Xbox. That would be cool. I got a friend too I play with.
---
Imagine having to track every single item in the game and not just the designated potted plants. If you don‚Äôt see the difference then ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
you can do endlessly, its part of a recipe. its just like you picking logs in the forest
---
I don't dupe but I pick up everything in sight and, as my friends put it, I am a garbage disposal for unwanted legendaries, so I have my Strength at anywhere from 18-21 on average with Deep Pocketed Gear and full weight reduction perks on what I need, max carry weight is about 370 right now without power armor and without those perks my weight goes from like 270 to 1200.
---
Before the patch I took on 3x lvl68 fog crawlers near Huntersville. 1 legendary dropped a lvl 50 LMG
---
BURNED through 1000 rounds in like 6minutes.
---
Hoping this buff will help me save some 308
---
obviously devs will add vending machine icon on the map so you don't need to move
---
Yeah... that constant hover crap sucks. I gave up on that and just act as Anti-Air.
---
Sounds like someone needs a nice, strong drink!
---
What's max amount of turrets we can build now? I'm still at work and haven't been able to play with the new update yet. Are there any other CAMP item caps beside turrets?
---
Almost as though the handle of the sledgehammer is skinnier than a baseball bat! Whoaaaaaaa!
---
I tbought the floors could be destroyed
---
Mole miner is unarmed and meat hook is bugged
---
Mole miner, deathclaw  and tambo aren't they all affected by unarmed perks instead!?
---
Yes but the silver shourd and grognak is just fictional characters in the universe, they are not actual real super heroes. Just the concept of having some kind of real super hero group in the game is ridiculous (and even more so ridiculous when they are all girls, but hey, girl power seems to be the thing in this game, and no wonder when you look at what is happening at bethesda in regards to the video they released in e3 promoting "diversity"). 
---
I got offered 75k for my Leather Coat, but I only have 1 account so was useless money for me.
---
Which frat house? 
---
I woke up on a picnic blanket in the Cranberry Bog with some witches who look like they had some kind of suicide pact deal thing going on. I need to brew some more as soon as possible.
---
fer sure!
---
Smashed a camp at White Spring last night behind the club house. Worst part was they were a level 181 I can understand why the lower level players do it but at level 181 do you suck that bad you have to turret farm White Spring.
---
I‚Äôve had that issue and resolved it by removing any excess/unworn armor pieces from character inventory. 
---
Nope
---
So iron fist effects them then......thankyou so much for the info
---
I'm pretty chapped the Nuka Shine you create spoils super fast.
---
"IS THERE ANYONE WHO NEEDS ME TO PROTECT AND SERVE!?"
---
No, im on Xbox and have the issue.
---
My guess is that they don't want you to nuke the DLC parade, just like they didn't want us to nuke the new year's gathering.
---
It's supposed to.  It turns into Vintage Nukashine.  It's part of the Fermenting Process.  Takes about 10 minutes or so.
---
 Deleted itself means what ? It‚Äôs not on your quests anymore or ?
---
&gt;side note you can start the next main story quest by going to its location.
---
The trailer is south of Berkeley springs. It has these markings on the wall in the bathroom.

Whoa tin cans are lead??? 
---
Not sure. Ill have a look, what's your gamertag?  
---
Oh snap, didn't wait that long to drink it after I fermented it lol, thought I was going to lose it
---
I would recommend playing 100% if you‚Äôre still a lower level in the game. The new features right now are good for all players, but higher levels still don‚Äôt have too many options, which should change with the coming updates. 
---
Same here , on Xbox 
---
Also, now even the Atom shop isn't loading.
---
You would have had to attack them first, or owned a workshop for them to pvp you. No one can just run up and one shot anyone without some sort of pvp initiation.
---
I had similar experience the first time I went to watoga and I had level 40 assaultron trying to kill me a higher level guy revived me 3 times and helped kill the assaultron.
---
If I have extra plans, stimpak and stuff I generally try give it to a low level player, most in the community are like this. There‚Äôs the occasional bad egg.
---
Personally my friend and I took note last night as we were doing the Nukashine quest.  Razorgrain harvested prior to going to the Nuka Plant to farm up Quantums would be spoiled before we got back.  And my a lot of the ingredients farmed from my CAMP garden seemed to spoil quickly.
---
But...  I could not tell if it was some sort of bias on my part.  I only noticed it spoiling faster cause I was actually trying to use it rather than just discarding/selling/giving it away.  As soon as you pay attention to something, you wonder if it's always been that way, etc.
---
When Taco Tuesday goes wrong
---
GT: rcayton1 already messaged u on xbox
---
Too little, too late. This game is DEAD.
---
Good point.
---
Woke up on a cliffside in the savage divide. There were corpses in lounge chairs and a garbage can with a small basketball hoop set up on it with some vodka bottles inside
---
Correct. The Meat Hook is the only one that is affected by both Iron Fist and Gladiator. Likely a bug that will be fixed in the future. 
---
I wish people would stop trying to find ways to get around the cap cost to travel and just play the game. 
---
It's not quite noticeable by the name like the "Fermentable Whiskey" etc is.  But once it's turned to Vintage, it no longer has a Condition bar, like the other alcohols.
---
Can put them in your fermenter to speed up the process.  I haven't got any times, but it goes by really fast.
---
Firstly, I like to see where I'm going.
---
Secondly, have you ever been in the mountainous countryside where theres no light pollution? On a clear night sometimes the moon turns into a second flipping sun.
---
Yes, I mean it‚Äôs not showing up in the quests menu. Thanks for the help, I‚Äôll be sure to try it
---
cleaner power armor hud was the offending mod in mine and a few other cases.  deleting the ba2, removing it from custom.ini, as well as updating the custom.ini with the new archivelist names for this update will fix it.
---
That's awesome, thanks for the info!, does it always teleport you after tho?
---
Sounds good now i have to work out what else will put up my damage as getting killed with one hit off a level 55 kind of humbled me after he attacked for no reason and i hit back
---
They did modify the spoil system.  But I think it was supposed to have been to make stacked items spoil properly rather than all together at once based on the lowest CND item?  It was worded kind of oddly.
---
The new Brahmin Milk spoils really fast though.  But that's milk, guess it makes sense :).
---
I've yet to drink my Vintage Nukashine again...
---
It still has the "Warning:  May cause Blackouts."  So I am guessing the answer is Yes.
---
Ah typo, it was ment to say "now able to be picked up"
---
Before it didn't make sense that a heavy weapon's durability was soooo small. They made a great change.
---
Haha, free random teleport lol
---
Bet it‚Äôs gonna be in the vault raids for higher levels in a future update
---
and yet here you are, on a "dead" game's subreddit.
---
&gt; Don't even get me started on the fact that I'm an alcoholic and having all the content centered around drinking and frat life is a huge trigger. Not an issue for most people but figured I'd mention lol
---
I'm not an alcoholic but I agree it is a bit over the top. 'Drink 25 alcoholic breverages' as a DAILY quest was not smart in my opinion, and I had to force myself to complete it. 
---
Deathclaw is considered unarmed? I figured it was considered one handed, no wonder my perks did nothing.
---
You can do individual,pieces (like torso)
---
Seen multiple calls there last night
---
So what? Here's the thing Bethesda has said. The system is not automated. Each report will be reviewed. If you weren't cheating, harassing, using offensive language, you have nothing to worry about. 
---
If a person isn't cheating, and someone says this too you, just don't react. That's part of what they are looking for, a reaction. To know that they just pooped on your parade, because you beat them. 
---
The less you respond and react, the faster this will go away. 
---
I can just imagine the level 15 just in a constant state of paranoia hoping you aren't trying to kill him, lol
---
Happens sometimes due to server sync issues. Relogging should fix it.
---
Rarest I think is the Longshore man outfit, seen it once and sold it for a measly 3k not knowing/realising it was rare. 
---
I've had the tattered, got the leather...
---
Hurr hurr.
---
And they haven't fix this shit.
---
I shot some mutant hounds in Watoga HS. Should have one shot them but they kept a sliver of health and then regened back to full hp. Happened every time I shot one. Luckily they seemed to be stuck in place. Have had other enemies doing the same thing you are experiencing.
---
It seemed more buggy to me. I had to go out and back into vats several times before anything would connect. Using a crossbow though, and it has it's own issues.
---
Well i am also against it. You should read a bit more carefully. 
---
I still can't use it, it's bad enough I ask my friends for any .50 Cal, 5mm, 40mm, Missiles and Mini Nukes they find but I'm not asking for an ammo type that one of my friends uses regularly.
---
I only got about 7% haha :) I had that thing stuffed tho 
---
I'm getting constant server disconnects today. DC as soon as I load into the world. Happened 5 times in a row.
---
When you get them keep me in mind rcayton1 lol. You're my best supplier 
---
I have a Pink uniform!
---
Ten turrets max and fifty lights :) 
---
Make that 4X.
---
Ah, well thanks for offering. I appreciate it.
---
Doesn't help right now, since they did this without any warning, overweight characters can't even Eat or Drink now.
---
Essentially Bethesda is making everyone (including legitimate avid gamers) Purge their own items.
---
Don't you have some hentai to jack off to?
---
Xbox :(
---
I crashed outside the frat house, restarted the game and said to myself ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs a rad storm‚Äù. Then I saw +35 Rads and server hopped quick. I had about 90% rads when I rematerialized. Not fun. 
---
Clearing your cache after every update helps.
---
https://beth.games/2POGnZv
---
Hey man, unfortunatelly i didnt find anything. Cant sell these items for caps, im sorry 
---
Thanks. That's more then I expected, I'll probably never hit the cap.
---
THEY'RE MAGS NOT CLIPS. Just joking lol
---
I couldn't get him to give any dailies after I finished the quest. Do I have to wait a day?
---
*laughs in speed demon*
---
Same. Crash on quit to desktop.
---
It still looks to sometime bug on zero, at least while I was trying to blitz in melee. Had to keep dropping and re-enabling vats.
---
It still doesnt have the range of the old blitz from FO4 but I do love having a blitzing character.
---
With the nukashine update, I really want a nukashine cola craft station they was in fallout 4:nukaworld!
---
I am on PC.
---
Making a new character won't be painful either, I mean it has been I while, and I've learned a lot in the meantime.
---
Thanks for the response by the way
---
I get the joke but not all "adults" enjoy drinking. Though I'm glad many do. 
---
This did get me to thinking that it would be worth looking into a system to make flavor packets like kool-aid. I think that stuff started to get big in the 50s.
---
They just greatly reduced the amount of caps you get for selling it to vendors. I went from getting 12 caps to 3 caps per flux now. So it would take more than one nuke zone run for me to clear out the vendors now, if I used this method.
---
Biv offers a daily repeatable quest. I had done his intro quest this morning (Australia time). This afternoon I went back to him with my son, and interacted with him. Had to brew Vintage Lead Champagne. Handing that in to him and I got the reward which was the Greek letters plan
---
I heard about a lemonade recipe and I hope to go hunting for it later tonight.
---
Lol you should try booting up the game once.
---
It is far from dead, and they have a huge road map laid out in front of us. This game is alive and well and only gonna get better from here.
---
am I the only one who wants that damned Nuka Cola Lamp?
---
A rational answer BUT WHAT IF this is what happens when people black out on nukashine??
---
Pretty much nothing
---
Thanks for posting, it would only have been a matter of time before I did this.
---
I too, got a free ragstag pet. Most definitely did not have any pets before the update. 
---
Even says owned by me. Very weird.
---
So you were trying to dupe nuka-shine and the game stopped you. Is what happened there.
---
You only build in your own CAMP and in the workshops across the map. There is farming. No fishing. You can tame one animal at a time (not sure about this one).
---
The only time I have this issue is when I'm trying to use 2 of the same weapon. Ie 2 handmade or 2 ahot6guns. Just as a test. Pick another weapon as your secondary. And start a fight. If it stays then it's the same class of weapons. I stopped carrying my 2 bolt action snipers cause of this.
---
Sorry for any grammatical errors or formating. Am on mobile ATM.
---
Good luck and happy hunting. Let me know if this helps
---
I sold this exact onlast nighttime one of the train station vendors. 
---
Really interesting what you wrote. Got me more interested in the lore. Thanks for the read
---
Basically what every multiplayer salt game needs
---
Yes! I'll have mixed feelings if they change that. I mean, I hate when people build turrets back there, but I'm starting to like destroying them..
---
Part lead and part steel. Scrapping them thus gives you two out of the three things you need to make bullets. Gunpowder can obviously be obtained by killing super-mutants, who usually have a few units of the stuff on them. 
---
But yeah, generally speaking, if you want lead, ask yourself what things you absolutely wouldn't want lead to be in, then look for those things and you're sure to find some in there when you scrap them. The world of Fallout is gleefully perverse that way. 
---
The only thing I've noticed is when loading in or leaving a building some things in the world take a while to render, but that's to be expected in any MMO with a large new content patch.
---
Commie maaaa'aaaam.
---
You should be fine with the R5 and RX580 - I've played before on a 2400G with 1050 Ti and its fine for those settings.  Haven't followed as closely on the latest processor developments but I'd say an R5 2600 paired with 1660 Ti would be the sweet spot price/performance if you had other games in mind as well for the next few years.  8GB of memory works well enough for F76 but 16GB has more room to grow.
---
It is not an exploit. Test it yourself. 
---
1. Grab 2 friends have them form a team. 
---
2.You go claim the Munitions Factory and own it.
---
3. You and one friend teleport down to Forward Station Delta
---
4. Have the other member of your friends team start claiming the munitions factory
---
5. Confirm that you are not yet in pvp
---
6. Get one shot by your friend (assuming their build is worth anything)
---
Yes.
---
If the word exploit doesn‚Äôt cover it, ‚Äúflaw‚Äù will, it‚Äôs 100% an abuse of a mechanic that‚Äôs not intended to be used the way it is.
---
Oh, not familiar with Monster, but I was going to add that tonic glows under a black-light.  
---
I can‚Äôt agree with this more, I‚Äôve been wanting to do a pistol build with revolvers but the damage is pitiful when compared to the fire rate and ammo rarity. The mods are hard to find, especially seeing as one of the revolvers doesn‚Äôt have any, and a double action option would be great for clearing out large groups. Either double action or just make them hit like trucks
---
Can confirm! I hit the SBQ last night and I normally carry 2 3star gatling plasmas that MIGHT get me through a plasma core. I thought it was really silly but they did work on SBs. Last night I went through 2 plasma cores (all I brought) and the durability did not even get past my bonus.
---
&gt;The flack this game garnered, it definitely earned
---
Nobody is saying it is flawless. But do you honestly think it earned all the actual **lies** being spread to make it sound worse than it was?
---
Do you always demand for your hand to be held? Have you ever modded a game through ini tweaks before? You are displaying how much of an amateur you are... and did you forget that the word CUSTOM is right in the name? All mods are "cheats" if you are a purist,  its entirely based on your point of view. For example I use the "glowing bags" mod to make it easier to find bags and lots of people would call that unfair and cheating but I don't. I wont install the "easy lockpick" mod that gives away the sweet spot, because I consider that one to be "cheating". Either way its all up to the individual player and nobody else because its CUSTOM.
---
Bugthesda back at it again. An extra day lol
---
Sorry replied to the wrong guy. 
---
Not sure if this will help you.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42913/kw
---
Did you have any luck? Is a jet-pack the only way to get to that floor?
---
Thing is, I'm not getting crashes, just server disconnects. 
---
Interesting, hadn't specifically noticed that
---
This whole patch was like 8 steps forward and 2 steps back. Give them some credit!
---
The issue wasn't the crops. The nukes caused the waypoints and tracking to not work, even on a server hop. 
---
Ok
---
if you expected that extra day to mean it will literally have 0 bugs then you aren't very smart.
---
It's impossible to create software with 0 bugs.
---
Powerfist is also unarmed.
---
Adjustments need to be made, yes, but to bloodied builds no. The real problem here is how quickly pvp can be initiated, its radius in comparison to the workshop, and how it can be initiated without warning. 
---

I guess Biv is not the only who can drink alcohol. That is one hell of a hangover and a night of munching on Mama Dolce's products.
---
Thanks but I‚Äôve since checked on Xbox live status and seems to be down for social and gaming 
---
Looks like someone shoved a rocket up his ass for a mobility upgrade üòÇ
---
Lol. I love the game. 540 hours deep. I call em like i see em. You chug the kool aid and brag about the red mustache ya Trog
---
What do you mean by "Nuka Cola terminal? Do you mean the bottling factory on the west side of the map?
---
I think it¬¥s wrong error . I think it¬¥s just some random kick or may if u the last one on a map. some people in FO76 are only glitch the game. Log out log in log out log in and so on. for a bit scrap. well + the servers are far from stable. It¬¥s a joke. there wanna only take money not spend. I¬¥ll stoped playing come back after 16 Weeks because a page called gamestar wrote F076 now stable ,bug fixed. and so on. I see nothing .same bugs and problems. Atomic Shop still a joke. I was allready pised off about the main game. no new content. 90% FO4 content. A dirrfent texture does not make a new item. And the circle closes ,"There dont want spend money. only take it"
---
Interesting because I‚Äôm not having any issues on my end.
---
It's a persistent multiplayer world.  Other than a few events dealing with things like "power up this power plant" that have a short duration change to the status of that power plant before it deactivates again... things remain static.
---
You yourself progress thru a story, discovering what happened to the area before you emerged.  But this has very little affect on the world around you, for yourself or others.
---
CAMP building can be enjoyable if you are into that sort of thing.  Yesterday's update gave me almost 25% of my CAMP building budget back as they reduced costs of certain items.  I was able to expand my CAMP and make things much more enjoyable for myself.
---
I'm going to quite miss that humanizing moment when my bad-ass-hardcore-steath-sniper stumbles into a patch and I have to pause, eye close, deep sigh myself 
---
Well you sure didn't bother trying to convince me you weren't stupid
---
Um.
---
We were the ones that cared enough to bitch about the issues. So, you are welcome for the fixes.
---
If it wasn't for the pages of negative feedback, FO76 would still be on fire.
---
You can polish a turd until you can see your face in it, but at the end of the day it doesn't change the fact that you have been playing with a piece of shit.
---
Sure but let's be honest, the Gauss Rifle didn't really need a buff like the other energy weapons did. The Tesla Rifle was still pretty good beforehand too.
---
As i established earlier, first assumption was the bloodied damage. The workshop and the PvP tick 100% needs to be restricted to the workshop area. Makes absolutely no sense for it to cover the entire map without being contested by the owner, if left abandoned PvP should NOT be initiated for the owner away from the workshop.
---
Seeing as they also included something similar in fo4, I really hope they officially flesh it out someday.
---
Robot integration and nukashine at its best.  Now if only it had the armorments of the sentry bot....
---
I'm really in love with the vintage outfit, whitespring carpet, and the red stove to match the red fireplace.  
---
Are you using something like a 50 cal or 50 cal ball?  
---
I'll agree, I don't find too much of that.
---
Most critters and ammo boxes yields several of the more common ammo - 10, 45, 308, and 38, as do the ammo boxes just laying around.
---
Morgantown, do the airport event - you'll get a bit of XP from all the scorched, and typically a quantity of all the common calibers, and lots of low power guns to scap for steel.  The supply drop at the end usually contains some ammo.
---
Mutants drop gunpowder.  Scrap their boards for wood.
---
High mutant concentration at Grafton steel, WV lumber, and the prison.
---
fertilizer plant area is good for scap steel as well.
---
Thre are a couple places that spawn boxes of screws, but yea, of all the materials, thats the one I have the least of.
---
Pocket watches contain gears, I think handcuffs do as well.   As already mentions, fans and typewriters are easy to find and contain gears.  Some toys do as well.
---
Or - If you have lots of caps you dont know what to do with, you can buy gears from vendors.
---
&gt;Ultracite 308 also crafts 81 rounds at a time with ammo Smith so it's much easier to make a lot of ammo.
---
Interesting - didn't know this.  Do you recall how much lead/steel per batch of ultracite 308?
---
Just cleared cache but seems to still be having issues. Thanks anyhow 
---
 not evn gna snd u a full resp..
---
Not to mention it's more ammo efficient, and more durability efficient. Even if the overall DPS suffers by a tick (honestly not sure if it does), the side-effects are nice. 
---
So thank you all for the comments to me! I did it last night and it was not bad at all but I have to rat myself out. While on the way to the Glass Bunker, I was fighting 2 scorchbeasts and its spawns and wasnt paying attention and fell into the fissure \*face plam\* Well that sucked, couldnt get out so I had to kill myself so I could respawn, sucky part was all of the ultracite from the scorchbeasts I killed prior was in my loot bag at the bottom :( Oh well what a noob move....
---
Mostly trash
---
For real?! That location had [a pin on the Shear Terror map](https://imgur.com/UcbqAqE), connected to West Tek!
---
I outlined the map deciphering process in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/au1p7q/shear_terror_easter_egg_conspiracy_w_maps/) post I made a while back. That pin location was previously empty... maybe the other pins have new clues?
---
Yeah. I still have zero :) 
---
Not mod related since it is happening on xbox and ps4
---
I stopped for a while. Still am. But it seems like things are looking up and Bethesda are improving along with the game. While the flack was severe, it wasn't unjustified. It was a mess. A lot of silly "scandals" and a questionable launch product. Blown out of proportion, but not unjustified. I am still curious about the class action lawsuit.
---
Happy to see things going well, because i do like the game a lot.
---
Every online game worth its salt has a report system. It‚Äôs a way to collect data on potential bad players, it‚Äôs not like an automated banning thing. 
---
I do not. 
---
I didn‚Äôt even try, assuming so.. 
---
Fuck it, I'd do it, I'd nuke my house, too. In one final drunken decision.
---
Very sensible advice. I don't have the game yet but may I ask? If someone suspicious started trying to annoy me - if I disconnected and rejoined the server, would I be moved to a different server so's to get on with playing the game without them in the same game? tia
---
I'm pretty sure they intend to enable that in camps very soon, if not it's already unlockable. They literally said there'll be new camp items unlockable.
---
I've heard the same but no one has used it on me. We've field tested it and as it does drain ap we dont find it viable to us and how we play
---
Even with the better with salt perk maxed out i have seen some fresh harvested meat, only 1 in my aid inventory, spoil in under 3 minutes.  The spoilage rate is way too high on some things even cooked.  Likely bugged, but not unexpected at this point.  
---
I think it‚Äôs a bug with the new update. They hadn‚Äôt announced this change in the latch notes (that I saw) and others have reported the same issue. Could be a similar problem as when all silos were offline a few weeks ago after an update. 
---
I thought there was a horrid for another issue coming Thursday, maybe they will address this as well?
---
Certain junk you can sell. Gold silver circuits as scrap not bulk
---
Really wish they would ban salty people like that for 24hrs, piss off with that salt.
---
Them saying it's free is also a slap to the nuts. They're basically saying hey we fixed some stuff for free! Aren't you satisfied? I logged in yesterday to nothing new, same bullshit content same bugs that been around since the beginning. Just cause they give the patch a name don't make it dlc.
---
What exactly is a ‚Äúmodder‚Äù 
---
Assuming he meant ‚Äúduper?‚Äù 
---
Some people are too damn sensitive.  I trade a lot with players but I don‚Äôt blast them if they turn me down.  
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Whitesprings has a bar on the second floor that sells alcohol.  Just server hop a few times to get all you need with the better bargaining perk.  Make sure to sell some items to the store  to get some of your caps back.
---
Let's hope I won't disconnect while doing the dailies for these recipes tomorrow...
---
It really is excellent, I also love the way it starts with "sucks" before proceeding with the more elegant text. :-)
---
What?! More searching corners needed apparently....
---
The only mod you can change the LMG with is the prime receiver, which isn‚Äôt the worst idea since I‚Äôve heard ultracite 308 crafts in batches of 81 instead of 21 (with perks). 
---
It‚Äôd take a ton of flux, though. 
---
And yeah, that‚Äôs me with pretty much every damage perk and 20% health. 
---
LOVE IT, chally moomoo on drums
---
sucks you had to go through that. but thanks a ton for giving everyone the heads up! i'm sure this will save alot of people frustration
---
üëå
---
It works, they just nerfed the values of the dmg buff that adrenal reaction gives you. 
---
How do you get a brahmin?
---
Man... Outrage is a helluva drug...
---
There were a lot of people who didn't even play the game, who came here just to rage.
---
Tickets, please
---
Ah, a troll. 
---
My suggestion to help with your build is a couple of things pertaining to shotguns. You should grab enforcer rank 3 in agility because it‚Äôs ridiculously op for shotguns and crippling. Also I‚Äôd take one rank each of shotgunner, expert shotgunner and master shotgunner. You can also add scattershot if you‚Äôd like, those will significantly help your shotgun part out. 
---
*Hype intensifies* thanks for my new goal pal ! 
---
Few MMO's, especially when the acronym came into being, have actually had thousands on the same server, it's [more about the total player base](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game).  
---
EveOnline for example has been the exception, not the rule, where everyone existing on the same "universe". Most of the rest have had divisions of one form or another.
---
Something I notice.  Having a Brahmin now takes up around 10-15% budget.  I had that much left and decided to Pam e one down and BOOM. THERE IT WENT!  
---
I should have stored it to see how much (as a level 125) but I forgot 
---
I just wanted some Brahmin milk.  You can milk anything with nipples after all. 
---
Nuke was launched on Morgantown/PS4 about 9pm last night - there was at least one legendary bloated in the spawn.
---
He's talking about the fraternity house
---
So you can only twitter in neon 
---
Na server hopping is fine just don't take any of the beer you have fermenting out of the aid tab of the stash
---
"Modder" is the console equivalent of hacker.
---
Basically you can't cheat on a 'normal' console, so you have to mod the thing in some way to allow you to cheat.
---
There‚Äôs a couple spots that never change. It‚Äôs the spots on the third floor you want to check. 
---
Also if you want brown or green I have extra I can sell at a good price. 
---
This so hard, need something other than tin scraps used to make a roof when we can have proper brick and drywall walls and concrete floors
---
perhaps thats how long the alcohol effect lasted?
---
Sweet will check that out Thanks for the heads up ü§ôüèº
---
Sounds good, Thanks!
---
Yeah I check everywhere every time I go. I'm probably going there not long after someone else on the server has tbf. I'll keep that in mind but I wana try and find them first. Thanks anyway
---
You are such a joke
---
It seems the pendulum has swung the other way..? Last night, in some situations, I had enemies immediately at 40-50% when entering VATS drop to 0% by the time I could pull the trigger - as if the % chance is now being artificially boosted by the client when entering VATS (so it‚Äôs not 0) and then it drops to the real % chance when the server catches up.
---
I believe it was only happening where the enemy had a low chance to hit due to range, being partially obstructed by an object, etc. This behavior happened repeatedly when entering/leaving/re-entering VATS with the same enemies (who weren‚Äôt moving, so the line of sight didn‚Äôt change and the chance to hit should‚Äôt have been fluctuating).
---
Guess it‚Äôs better than 0% every time you enter VATS. But it creates the same lack of certainty when using VATS and makes me pause to see what the real chance is before firing. 
---
The scrapper perk is worth the investment  in you scrap weapons.  It also just got buffed woth this past patch by about 40%.  With 15 int and the scrapper perk each assult rifle is 19 steel, each laser rifle is 10 plastic 2 glass 1 rubber and a few steel.
---
Wait, you can put emojis in posts? Oh, man that‚Äôs a game changer...
---
Now I have to go back and put broccoli cat in all my old posts for added emphasis and clarity!
---
This game and franchise is populated by boomers with 3 kids and no time. They dont care anymore. Cash shop is their profit margin now. Turns out middle aged dudes and gals love blowing money on virtual vanity. Second Life had the formula ages ago.
---
I was under the impression that they were going to restore them to pre-patch 6 values?
---
According to the reps the 'nerf' was unintentional.
---
I... don't know man. At this point seems mostly a 'work with what you are given' situation...
---
I'm fine more or less, because I leveled 9 alt characters to hold equipment and traded for / farmed weight reduction gear, the **point is all of the other people who didn't have the time/insane obsession to do the same**.   
---
So someone with less than 1/20th of What I've collected, is way over the 1,500 hard cap (over base carry weight) and is completely screwed.  
---
The point is even if it's about the total weight, the destruction cap should be set at what the real hard cap for no long picking anything up is.. 
---
Just run in, take elevator to the third. Check bunk beds and showers near the elevator. No luck then reload. The rest of the place is just wasting time. 
---
Good luck. 
---
I feel the same way about Rockstars trailers
---
Tesla rifle did get a buff. Mine now does 160 damage compared to pre patch 120damage
---
So again were excusing 0 QA. No one tried the simple thing of server changing while fermenting. Fuck me, eradicate all Bethesda fanboys
---
LOL a few minutes after posting the above post I went into Pleasant Point river and contracted a mutated disease that turned me into a marsupial. I noticed I could jump higher so I ran back to the building and jumped on the displays to get up. There's nothing up there but water and a dead settler with a low level rifle.
---
That I saw, after the nuke, the party crashers \*inside\* the frat house and bar were   
---
 low level and normal appearance.
---
outside...those were glowing bloated....lvl 50+
---
Yes, all the crops in the blast zone were flux.
---
Wiki for resin locations, hard lemonade is sold from the lemonade stand random encounter, look for him near Watoga
---
Heavy guns got a 10% damage buff and a slightly reduced rate of fire, so you should do alright?
---
Just curious. What system are you on? I had the complete opposite experience last night on PS4 pro. The game ran pretty damn smooth for me. I could have just had dumb luck.
---
Actually, since the patch this has happened to me twice.  Relatively soon after I log in, I got a "server not responding" and then kicked out.  I kept trying; hasn't happened since and I put about 4 hours into the game.  Not sure what to tell you; I believe you, but keep trying?
---
Thanks alot
---
Soo,, maybe that's where they stuck the new skins for the Excavator and the Ultracite PA ? :D
---
I drop my duplicate and known plans in overseers caches.
---
Theres also 2 that spawn in a corner by the collapsed floor on the right hand side and one that spawns behind some fallen lockers on the first floor that's very hard to notice. Also the first trip there you gotta get all the first aid kits and mirrors
---
There is already a post from Bethesda that they're investigating the issue.
---
Lol, I did that once too
---
I think Bethesda needs to explain these mechanics more clearly in-game since most players don't seem to understand them. I suspect that the majority of "killed by 10k duper slap damage griefer" posts are this.
---
It also seems like the primary function of workshops has shifted quite a bit since launch. They used to be solid places for gathering resources but now it feels like they're (mostly) only useful of PVP since they nerfed extrator rates. Personally, I've never taken a workshop for resources as it didn't feel worth it, even pre-nerf. I claim workshops for the occasional legendaries in defense events and because I enjoy the added tension of players being a real threat everywhere on the map.
---
I tried the ambush method you described above a few times and found it very cheap and unrewarding although I do not look down upon people who do it. I always use stealth and wear a piece of chameleon armor when claiming shops which mitigates most of the threat. Sure, someone can constantly lurk the map and try to locate me when I'm not in stealth but I'm okay with this. 
---
That aside, I haven't seen Bethesda weigh-in on wether or not this is an exploit or a feature. The entire FO76 pvp experience is wonky as hell and feels like one big exploit so I'm not going to point fingers and call people that use this exploiters. I do not have any good suggestions on how to improve the system except one - at the very least, Bethesda needs to explain these mechanics more clearly.
---
I mean you could say that your mule accounts represent a set of close friends or family from the vault. The main character you play as is the most capable so they go out there and get stuff and do the fighting and the mules just manage and maintain it. Nobody steals your stuff? Thanks to mules. 
---
Hell, I'm RPing this and I don't even use mules. Instead I always play with a party of 3 people and we just specialize and share our hauls. I play the heavy and craft weapons/ammo, a friend is a medic shotgunner and they also do chems, and the last is a sniper build who also is our cook. Because we trade weight isn't an issue by using power armor. Huh. Maybe mules are lame. 
---
By eye, about 5-10%
---
Saving post, the mysterious occult happenings in the fallout games have always been one of my favorite parts.
---
nope sadly those will be atom shop
---
There is actually little to nothing persisting in this world.
---
Tbh Coca-Cola or Pepsi would also possibly work, monster assault tastes like an energy drink equilvent to these with a fruity undertone.
---
I did consider tonic in the recipe as I took info from nuka quantum for its glow effect but thought it might make the drink a bit bitter 
---
Rawr
---
I'm not outraged, and haven't presented as such, hell im largely unaffected by this, because I leveled about 9 alt characters to hold equipment, just my "donation" mules are screwed.  
---
The problem is the hard cap for Destruction is set at the same number you can no longer pick things up at, and it is (in my mind) unfairly targetting all the people who had been hording for the upcoming player vending.  
---
As of 2 months ago we can't add to any character 1,500 pounds over the max carry, having that same weight causing destruction, for a level 1 character with 1 STR designed as a "mule" seems excessively harsh since the actual potential with perks is closer to 30,000 
---
Were planning on moving to survival.
---
Im full 3 star cavalier. Gonna sprint past players and stike up convos lol.

*sprints past*

*Sprints away*

"Follow meeeeeee"

I don‚Äôt think those ones will spawn colored outfits though. They are static. Also don‚Äôt pick up the ones you don‚Äôt want or you‚Äôll lose that spawn point for a day.

Im on PC dude

/u/valseek
---
This seems like an important bug. Not sure if it was reported in the large thread yet.. It's hard to go through the 1k comments lol
---
Thanks for the tag...  
---
Guess I should brush off the dust and start new pages this weekend.
---
Good find tyty
---
He says " come back tomorrow to help me with some more quality tests" 
---
This is a bit off topic but early one morning I logged to a totally empty server. I played for about an hour before claiming a workshop and suddenly the entire map was populated with players. Perhaps it was just a coincidence but it felt like my actions bumped the server to the top of the player queue. 
---
SO basically what I'm saying is, I believe you.  There might be some initial hiccups with syncing your character to the new servers, I don't know.  If you try more tha  3 or 4 times and it's still happening, let us know.  Otherwise, try a couple more times.
---
I was in a random cabin just south of "The Vantage" to the east of Whitesprings.
---
Explosive is still king, two shot is now hated as much as hunters, exterminator edfect. Now every one wants bloodied explosives, instigating explosive, anti armor explosive.
---
Melee is back in style and the new BIG DAMAGE meta.
---
And unyielding armor. 
---
I did wonder that but I have to check them just incase theres a minute possibility lol I'm sure I'll get them eventually. At least it's more fun than trying to spawn the responder bot
---
Chally confirmed. 3 bottles received...
---
Why was that not added? I swear that was the only problem area anyway?
---
No kidding. I‚Äôm trying for lemonade vendor right now. 
---
Nah, we were all hiding behind the furniture waiting for you to take over the workshop.
---
You took your time too! my kneees were getting properly achy! you try to crouch behind a sofa for an hour at my age!
---
Op means the chassis, in order to get into it
---
I found an explosive one. Reminds me of a boltgun, that happens to make things stand still.  Ho god, does it burn through ammo tho
---
Nice to see Bethesda burning vault numbers for this shitass game. Who the fuck cares about lore anymore.
---
I tend to crash 1-2 times within 8 hours. No real rhyme or reason to it I've noticed. Can't remember the last time I was disconnected from the server. Can't say that it doesn't happen, but it's not noticeable to me. 
---
Like he said it seems to be a problem only if you remove the items through the stash
---
yeah it has changed, but did you find  a way of unlocking it yet ? :)
---
Except that's not what passive means. Passive skills are just things that make you generically better - such as a small damage bonus - while active skills make you able to do something, like pick better locks or craft better equipment. Which gives the biggest problem: Which category is Gunsmith &amp; co? They make your weapons or armour passively last longer, but actively make you able to better improve them.
---
Even if you use combat/non-combat division rather than passive/active, there's no obvious split there - guns lasting longer is a combat bonus, but repairing is a non-combat bonus. If you make them non-combat, they'll be no-brainer picks for any build that ever uses guns, but if you make them combat, people will get annoyed about switching them still (such as between gunsmith and demo expert for high burst damage).
---
Two groups of perks does not magically solve the perk management issues.
---
The Emotes in this game are insufficient. Many people take offense to say a thumbs down when that's all that really applies.  Why (BGS) cant we have something like a "Not now" or for team invites a response like "Maybe later"
---
Etc.  The vomit emote is just stupid...
---
Sometimes i dont feel like stopping and trading (especially in a nuke zone) and dont need any backlash from sensitive people that want to be on a team.
---
They do make it stupidly difficult for vendors to spawn. I've actually come across grahm at Charleston more times that the responder bot lol does the lemonade one sell anything other than lemonade?
---
Folks, this bug can happen even IF you dont touch those items in your stash. I didnt touch mine and am locked from that account exactly as stated here.   I was on a server that my camp spot was taken but I didnt plan to go to the camp that session as I was just farming and across the map anyway so I stayed and played. I didnt drink or touch the items from the ferm that I saw in my inventory stash when grabbing some snacks.  Its possible one changed its status during this play time and caused the bug as if I manually moved the item myself.  Anyway,  An hour later I got a message that the server I was on was going under maintenance and to join another world, so i left server and loaded another and boom instant disconnect every dam time. It doesnt even try to load a server it literally just instant D/C every single time. My other character loads fine and the only difference is that one has not touched the new stations and is fricken level 3....   
---
Get your shit together bethesda as this is the type of bugs that your QA teams are supposed to catch. Game breaking easily identified code conflicts.   As a QA tester myself its baffling the testing teams missed such an easily identifiable issue that players like myself encounter in just a few hours of play.    
---
Nobody expects new content to be 100% bug free, but when you have multiple players finding the same game breaking bug hours from the release of said content, it just shows the lack of testing (or care) on the developers behalf.  
---
That's awesome! I assume this is new?
---
He changed server whilst fermenting and decided to delete his camp when moving to a new server. 
---
yes, usually.. When you disconnect, wait maybe 20 seconds before logging back in Sometimes, if you immediately log back in, you may be put back into the same server
---
If this was Coke this would be my grandmas house. 
---
THey've moved on to the Anthem sub lol
---
Thank you, I wasn't sure if I was understanding it correctly so this clarification does indeed help me understand more so.
---
Spoil rates are at best random.  Had 1 fresh  stingwing meat from project beanstalk go bad in under 3 minutes with maxed out better with salt perk last night (the only 1 in my aid category).    They are for sure higher than prepatch, and likely bugged.
---
"55%! 55%! We wanted 85%!" in Dudley Dursleys voice

Plans for hard lemon aid. 
---
I did it last night when I was doing some of the drunk dailies. Was server hopping workshops and my last hop the camp didn't place. Checked the Flatwoods store for more booze and there was none, so checked my stash... saw some drinks there, grabbed them all (figured they'd keep fermenting in my inventory) and 30 in later or so when I server hopped I couldn't get back in the game.
---
I'm not gonna o back and forth with you on it. But I feel like a lot of people agreed with and liked my idea. Thanks for your insight tho. 
---
I woke up on a cliff edge where a tightrope was and I woke up at a pumpkin seance 
---
I can't give you advise on your specific build as  imgur is blocked for me, but you may retrieve some usefull information from the build I'm using on my [stealth sniper](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6c656d8&amp;d=su2sg2p02pd0pk0pp2pl0eh2eo2c72cu0ic4i10ar2an2as2ao0au2l71lt2lu2&amp;w=&amp;n=Sniper_Shotgun).
---
Note that there are 3 points free in perception as I run comando as well. You can use these at your leisure. The other are pretty much staple. Also, this is a build with mutations in mind as I run serveral of them (Marsupial, Healing Factor, Speed Demon, Adrenal Reaction and Scaly Skin)
---
I didn‚Äôt even get one daily quest out of him :(
---
Yeah, really though! They don't play the game? lol even post buff it's very obvious something is wrong
---
If you open your pip boy at the right time while spawning, you can get stuck looking at it until you server hop.  Fast travel does not fix it.
---
That's not what your post says. 1st/3rd person camera, and a different pip-boy UI are very different things.
---
Besides, this sort of change is surprisingly awkward and complicated to do. It's easier just to spread the word that the visor-type view lacks the animation.
---
My guess is that everyone will start building near the major zones (Whitespring, Harper's ferry, Watoga), and many of the train stations.. I've had a CAMP/shop built in the back of Whitespring Station for the last couple of months, and I have a feeling that I'm going to have a hard time logging into a server that will have my CAMP in it. Hopefully they start to allow CAMPS to be in a slightly closer proximity to eachother
---
Well, at least it wasn't a molerat or something that exploded like a legendary robot. Because that can happen, too. 
---
Because most people have already moved on and stopped caring/complaining lol.
---
No i lock my stuff but i also have a water purifier open for people who need it and crops for those who need it. Im also in the mountains where no one travels so my recommendation is to move from your location to something a bit more secluded.
---
I like it as it's kinda "fast travel roulette"  lol
---
Thanks for the advice, mate. I'll be sure to look into the Better Business Bureau and see what can be done that way... I wouldn't mind the wait if it wasn't for the fact that my tickets and tweets are blatantly just being ignored. 
---
It reminded me of gta5 story mode when you load in as Trevor. 
---
Don't be dumb.
---
Even without locks there are now people who have gotten so bored with the game they have resorted to destroying player camps just for fun
---
So locks or no locks some people will destroy your camp just for fun I have been having the same problem and I cant wait for them to fix the pacifist mode to prevent this
---
All good comments here.
---
Basically, I never seem to be out of mats to fix stuff, and i have a ton of ammo on me, of every type (i use perks to reduce ammo weights to almost 0).  I get it all by collecting stuff off of kills..it really builds up over time.
---
I had items fermenting, yet didnt touch them. I stayed on a server that could not load my camp for about an hour.  Game told me the server was going into maintenance so I went to change worlds and thats when the conflict began.   I would just not play at all on a server that you cannot place your camp until they fix this crap.
---
No reason to lock your doors. No one can take anything from your camp, other than resource extractor/purifiers. Go ahead and lock the extractor and purifiers.
---
Why do you want a super sledge? Pole hook is where it‚Äôs at.
---
Its possible but it would be nice to get 100% way to trigger the quest.
---
Learned about this right after logging on yesterday, I had logged off in Watoga, Pre-Patch, as soon as I logged in, I saw a legendary Protectron, so I promptly donned my DC Gauntlet and gave him a little slap up side the head, which resulted in a crippling injury, and a 5 minute search for his remains.
---
Thinking this was some sort of fluke, I repeated the mistake again just a few minutes later with the same results, so now I'm thinking about which is more valuable; Stimpaks or Ammo, Hmmmm......
---
&gt;My question is being new to the game am I asking for troubles by locking my stuff?
---
Na.  You'll just find random jerks.  They are not the norm though.
---
I keep my purifiers and junk extractor locked.  But none of my doors are locked.
---
I've only had my camp attacked once by players.  Other than the occasional new player who kills my Brahmin and gets a 5 cap bounty and panics.
---
One time there was a level 5 at my camp, and I got the "under attack" warning, looked and he had a bounty.  I assumed he killed my cow, so I ignored it.  Came back to my camp some hours later after he was gone.  Found two of my walls blow apart, most of my crops damaged, my generator and junk extractor dead.
---
But, I don't think he did all that.  I think he walked there and caused some eye bots or protectrons to spawn.  Killed my cow mistakenly, ran away and left those enemies to attack my stuff until eventually my single turret or someone else killed them.
---
AFAIK. The rug trick still works. Try a doormat
---
Really basic advice but if you're playing solo, I'd suggest taking Lone Wander (in Charisma) and maxing it out to three stars. Hard Bargain is great but you don't need it equipped all the time. 
---
Automatron DLC confirmed.
---
Love the update!!!! Every patch makes the game even better and more addicting... #ThanksBethesda 
---
Small bug, dunno if it is known or not:

XB1, trying to place a radio/object onto a shelf that is on the ground floor of a multi-level building will cause the object to be placed in between the flooring of the level above it. Annoying but not too much of a biggie, if you remove the floor above it before placing the object, it works just fine then the floor can be replaced.
---
Crashed once last night on me after I nuked White Springs. Luckily I had a team. 
---
On PS4 it‚Äôs the R3 button, don‚Äôt know what your platform is but thankfully Bethesda is looking into this
---
And why is that?
---
&gt; There is actually little to nothing persisting in this world.
---
I just mean it's not dynamic.  It's static.  It exists as it is from now until they decide to make an update that changes something big.  Nothing you do has any permanent affect on the game world.
---
yeah this happens from time to time. my advice- keep enough copper, concrete, and stable flux to make necessary repairs. (steel, wood, and plastic are too easy to find and/or you‚Äôll have them on hand anyway.
---
takes about 3 minutes to repair.
---
Any player who kills me is getting reported. I only play pacificist.
---
Was about to say this wasn't a bug and is a thing, but then I saw the image... definitely bugged.
---
They will spawn during the event at the Teapot where animals attack the machinery, if you're looking for easy ones to kill.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying for more great content.
---
That's interesting... if that's the case then completing fermentation is effectively the same as removing/changing the item within the fermenter. Not sure how people would avoid that other than to server hop until they find a camp spot... or just not use the fermenter at all.
---
Staying put when you camp has been placed in order to ferment does seem like the best course of action till this is resolved.
---
 While it does suck that it happens I do appreciate the information you've provided me. Thank you.
---
Love stuff like this.
---
Does a pole hook of the same level do the same or more damage?
---
100% mechanic abuse, if you don‚Äôt see anything wrong with killing someone across the map from a workshop there‚Äôs something wrong with you. PvP activates BECAUSE the workshop is contested. If said owner or workshop thief is then NOWHERE near said workshop, it should NOT be contested since there‚Äôs no 2 opposing players WITHIN the workshop boundary.
---
It‚Äôs mechanic abuse, an exploit. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a glitch, to be an exploit.
---
This. Both weapons are unarmed but the meat hook errorously also benefits from one handed perks.
---
Are referring to the new trailer for wild Appalachia DLC where is says free? All the content featured was not realeased in yesterday's patch, it's comming out over the course of the new couple of months.  
---
Just in case you missed it. 
---
Love it! Anyone else having trouble with their C.A.M.P. since the patch?
---
Doubt it's for wild Appalachia if there's missing textures after a 20gb update 
---
The lies were from betheada not the players.
---
Hmm, this might get me to give the game another go.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I hope I'll be able to get the challenge with only one beer.
---
That would technically be cheating
---
One of my first times at Mama Dolces, I encountered a similar thing with a Mr Handy. It's absolute gold lol
---
Please let it grant a protection against limb damage, that would be great :D
---
Truuu
---
I mean how pointless is wasting a perk point on Nighteyes :( !
---
I seriously cannot even tell when it is night time
---
&gt; and stable flux to make necessary repairs
---
Better word of advice:  Don't keep CAMP items out (not-stored) that require Stable Flux to repair if your CAMP is in an area readily accesible to other players.
---
So glad that the indie devs betheada keep milking me for money. I appreciate the drip feed of content am I right?
---
If you can‚Äôt show your vending machines on map for other players I will be choked. I have been practicing and perfecting trap builds and this is a must haha 
---
I got Quad explosive revolver.Thats fun.Only problem is that i havent enough INT for all the perks.Maybe alt or sell
---
 Definitely do Tea Time as stated above,  but also wander the roads to the west of Watoga.
---
Also, can we please name the power armor? It's a little bit sad that I have to pull them all out of the stash in order to find the one I'm looking for. 
---
Does that happen every time? I only drank it with the quest originally. 
---
No cups = no party , the cups must stay 
---
Patch note says 10%-20% damage increases and durability buffs. Neither the Gauss Rifle, Flamer, Cryolator or the Tesla Rifle are energy weapons. Did you check any of this or are you just getting upset for no reason?
---
yes, this IS better advice.
---
Thanks.  Appreciate it
---
This. The timing matches.
---
agreed, they "buffed" it by making you slower, and increasing thirst.. it's like you are trekking through the sandy desert lol
---
me three
---
No but the new content does. Yeah, it's not extensive but it's new and surely that's the defining feature that allows something to be designated as DLC.
---
That's funny.  I have been hoping to add Brahman.  Can't find the plan.
---
Can‚Äôt be appreciative of finally getting new content I see. 
---
That's reassuring - thanks!
---
YASSSSS!
---
VTU Jacket and Jeans aren't rare anymore, you can just find them lying around in the new house.
---
I need these backpacks. I NEED MY BEATNIK MICROBREWING BEERPACK.
---
Good to know.  I'll remove locks from shack
---
It's the only thing I was thinking about when I was playing. 
---
I NEED THAT LAMP
---
Aliens?! Maybe it‚Äôs aliens!!! Oooooo!!!
---
These fools think they are so smart...So over the weekend I became wanted for the first time in my 84 levels...There was a Govt drop box at Whitesprings and there was no one around. Infact it didnt look like there was anyone else on the server with me. I waited next to it for almost 10 minutes and no one showed up. So I thought what the heck and went ahead and picked the lock even though it warned me about "Stealing from someone else." I had seen this warning in the past and it never really did anything. So I collected the few items and got a 10 cap wanted title. I really felt horrible but went on my way. Not being a PVP'er I thew myself off a cliff thinking if I died it would clear the wanted status. Well it didnt. So I went on my way. About 15 minutes I get an invite from someone I didnt know, I accepted anyway and get a voice saying "oh jeez Im sorry I really didnt mean to invite you but lets just leave it anyway..." So I didnt think anything of it and went on my quest. He was 17 levels lower than me.
---
So I am at Fort Defiance and he was up in the NW corner of the map, next I know all of a sudden he is at Fort Defiance with me! So now Im thinking this is interesting. So I am getting suspicious. So I went and found him in the building and without saying anything he shoots and kills me...He then comes on the mic and in a timid voice says "oh man Im so sorry I didnt know I could kill you I thought we were on the same team..." So while I was happy my wanted status was gone, I left group, respawned, came back and two shotted him and stood over him and said "oh man Im so sorry I didnt know you were such an asshole liar....
---
Come on asshats, just admit when you come after people and want to try to kill us for a lousy 10 caps!
---
I might add a second purifier and leave unlocked.
---
Wait! 
---
I just checked a wiki on it, and I think it may be randomized. There are definitely insects that will spawn, but not always ants maybe? There were definitely ants the two times I did it, but maybe someone has a better suggestion.
---
Man bear pig
---
Yup. You can put any alcohol in the fermenter to make it vintage. Most basic alcohols are unlocked already, but it seems like some of the other brands of beer (such as black water brew) need to be unlocked. There‚Äôs also going to be a ton of other recipes to unlock. 
---
I assume pacifist mode will allow use to opt out of pvp?
---
Did my typical WS run last night, with poor results;
---
* Ghoul spawns were very sparse
---
* Only found 5 legendary enemies, 4 Ghouls &amp; 1 Honeybeast (Normal is 10-14)
---
* 2 of the Ghouls dropped no legendary items (not even a Drill)
---
Unyielding armor with low health, plus perk cards
---

4-5 rad ant fighting a deathclaw there
---
I was in the middle of a stream, I wasn‚Äôt going to close out the game for that. 
---
Inside one of the elevated train cars in the Cranberry Bog for me. 
---
If that's the case, I feel bad for the people paying 12k caps for them
---
lol I don‚Äôt die üòÇ
---
Yup, it's one of a handful of new random encounters.
---
I need to know this!!
---
Thx. I had not tested that yet. This is a side effect of the foundation stacking fix. They basically made it so that the edges of the campfire are no longer considered dirt.
---
Only the true believers remain. Most other people have given up. I'm actually one of the giver uppers. I tried the new stuff and I'm not impressed. Moreover, the game sill has some major bugs that would be easy to fix. They have had months to fix bugs. Why not do the easy ones??? If the game had mod support, then the unofficial patch would have already cleared 90% of the bugs.
---
It's a shame because I have a quad laser rifle I've been saving up for a while now. Any buff is better than nothing, but I was already worried about this a week or two ago when they released that into the vault giving details about the buff. 5x for the heavy energy weapons that were sorta bad, but only 2x for the worst weapon in the game in terms of durability?
---
Not all at 40 though, but pretty high
---
**ME TOO. BETHESDA WHY YOU GOTTA DO THIS TO US?!**
---
I just got one by doing Bivs daily quest. That, a new recipe and Plan: Greek Letters
---
Me too, its an unfortunate change.
---
That is what I understood from a Bethesda comment 
---
Well I tried the new stuff out for half an hour and met old bugs and new (at least new for me)
---
Ah, I had to interact with him to receive the note. I didn't get a notification that it was "added" to my inventory so i only noticed it way later. 
---
1000 Atoms, next week or 2 just u wait n see
---
What perks?  I know Radicool give STR a boost, but haven't seen any others.
---
Can confirm to have consistently encountered them there.
---
.....white Russian? Rugs? Bathrobes? It might be, like, just my opinion man but this reminds me of something....
---
Yeah my explosive splitters are pretty damn good now. I imagine bethesda will continue to buff/fix laser rifles, but will nerf the splitter mod.
---
Since when? What did they lie about?
---
YouTubers and redditors lied about anti cheat, being banned for no reason, game having no NPCs and so much more.
---
I don't recall Bethesda lying about anything 
---
No, it‚Äôs said that since day one. 
---
Could have seen this coming - sharing the storage with the stash was not a good idea.  Should have been a separate 0/20 container for fermenting items only.
---
I suspected everyone was hiding in the dumpster at Dolly Sods... *where they all belong*
---
I fell through the bunker but landed on another level. 
---
Not a very good one. I get that there‚Äôs restricted areas now, but how are we going to know where these are if we still can build anywhere we want? I built my camp in the same spot twice. Got the same message after I logged back in. Why let me build the camp there in the first place? I don‚Äôt even want to take the time to make anything until I know for sure that it won‚Äôt get taken away. 
---
I want him as a companion.
---
I got reported on R6s because someone had bad aim lol even left me a nice voice chat screaming and calling me all sorts of names.  Lol
---
i havent noticed yet..maybe becos im spending all day rebuilding my camp ü§®
---
[My camp by the lake near the monorail elevator](https://i.imgur.com/WLpl7Ev.png) was removed with a non-build area pop-up, which frustrates me quite a bit because I loved the spot and the build, and the blueprint will not fit on any other location so I will need to start from scratch somewhere else.
---
&gt;I just wanted to see if anyone else has had people 
---
You really ask that? Hell yeah, that's standard anywhere. Also, how is the player reporting you, to judge? It's not his thing.
---
&gt;abuse this report function to file false reports?
---
Say what? From what you say he clearly believed you were cheating. That's not abuse.  That's not false reporting.
---
I think the dividing line between 1 handed and "unarmed" is if it can be used in power armor. If you can't use it in power armor, it counts as unarmed. If you can use it in PA, it counts as 1 handed. 
---
Ouch :D
---
A lawn chair with a corpse surrounded by garden gnomes.  Somewhere in Savage Divide, or right on the boarder of Savage Divide.
---
If you mean damage in terms of the number indicated on the gun, I would remind you that if you put on the perk awareness you'll note that a lot of critters have half the resistance to energy that they do to ballistic.
---
If you mean you went out in the real world and tried it to see how effective it is then I retract my statement, because I have literally scrapped all my energy weapons because of their uselessness and so have no way of testing them. I wouldn't be surprised if you're right though.
---
yep, totally expected....though cool to see through the floor before it rendered in some buildings lol
---
That's a bold statement.
---
On PS4 hitting R3 in a vendor just sorts it for me
---
Any good party has collateral damage. Pour one out for that corpse.
---
ok...that makes sense.
---
I thought all the cards you were presented were selectable at any time.
---
  I made a few errors early on so I have a couple unused points in strength - I was trying to figure out how to get back to the full deck to use the points, and can't.
---
  I think whats confusing me is in all categories but strength, I have several cards to pick from any time I open the perks screen, and that I recall, the cards I can see/swap in those categories  are not cards I selected.
---
Last night i had one for 187 hours....this morning they were all at 0.....according to the silo holotape......well see

Mainly as a caps sink for the economy, not that it makes much a dent anyway

My furious minigun was absolute beast mode last night. Still chews through ammo, though
---
My 1st character was more stealth focused. But it is quite fun to gain high ground and rain death on anything in sight.
---
Picked this back up myself after a month. Good changes 
---
Pc
---
I 100% didnt touch the items and I have the issue. Read my previous post.  Its possible when one changes its status during fermentation while playing with it "in the stash" due to camp not being placed, may be triggering the same conflict.
---
I also wonder if OP is talking about the "we fixed adrenaline reaction so you can't get more than the intended damage bonus" fix.
---
Only spawned 2 for me, sadly.
---
Well, I can't do that challenge anymore. I've used the only beer I had :(
---
Yep, same issue on Xbox as well.. Hopefully when they fix it, they will add the ability to "inspect" in a trade window with another person as well. That was always a pain, and took a lot of trust when trading with someone.  Luckily, when I bought 2 different 3\* armors last night from a vendor, they turned out to be sentinel pieces.. 
---
Ah interesting. So much conflicting info around about rare items. 
---
I loan my kleptomania to the vendors in exchange for caps. Also, knees weak, arms are heavy my pocket is full of junk and spaghetti.
---
So am I! First technical data I dropped off after the patch and I got it. 
---
They are also probably just assholes ive run into a few of those over my time

When you pull up the map in FO76 look at Point Pleasant, you'll see a brown building to the south of the drawing on the map, this is a giant signal tower on a ridge, just behind it 100ft or so is another gigantic cult monument with several dead cultists laying on the ground. 
---
rug works fine. 
---
These evildoers will meet their fate soon!
---
Good god, reading some of the comments here makes me realize how infested with trolls reddit is  People are seriously arguing that the buff was just fine and the energy weapons now stack up just fine with hand made. 
---
That is just so nonsense.
---
My semi-auto handmade with  zero damage boost  from legendary effects does 103 damage.  My LEGENDARY Ultracite laser rifle with the same perks does 69 damage after the buff.
---
A combat rifle with zero legendary effects does 92 damage. 
---
Energy weapons are nowhere close to being on par with ballistic. 
---
PSA: anyone who has an indoor garden using campfires (they act as terrain for crops), the new patch has corrected this and you can no longer place crops indoors. 
---
If you have a blueprint with this you wont be anle to place it, and if you tear down your current camp, you wont be able to do it again.
---
Yeah definitely assholes.  Just wasn't sure if I was breaking some unwritten rule.
---
I found it odd they were hidden in my shack, then waited so long to destroy my stuff
---
Ya that's why a buncha people are mad they either bought or had to grind Events to get em, but now boom, widely available. But honestly I think this is much better, giving everyone a shot at grabbing em
---
Woke up in the back of a carriage bound for Helgen... 
---
There is a Bethesda post somewhere on the forums that said it is not an automated system.  Reports will still be checked out by Bethesda so if you didn't do anything you shouldn't have anything to worry about.  
---
Thanks. So what is the display to the other players?
---
That‚Äôs what you get for trying to sneak across our borders!
---
I crashed during the first five minutes if the new nuka quest while trying do drink the moonshine.
---
That's interesting, it wasn't mentioned in the patch notes (which I can understand) but it raises the question on what else was changed?
---
Same here. my camp was moved, so I set up a new one like 10 feet down the road. When I went to place my blueprint, I got that message. In the end, I ended up scrapping it and rebuilding from scratch. I think it came out better in the end, but, still annoying. 
---
There is a repeatable glitch that allows for doubling the effect of unyielding armour.
---
Pressing the poster doesn't give me the quest. Am I doing something wrong or is it just bugged? Thanks! 
---
I'm running into the same issue after patch 6.. logging in, or switching to/from power armor, my "quick" switch weapon button gives me bare hands. Quite a few times, I found myself overwhelmed by enemies when I tried to switch from a ranged weapon, to a 2-hand melee, and instead, had to either punch them to death or go into the pip boy to re-equip.
---
Responder Fireman Outfits and Clean Spacesuits can be added to that list.
---
Check every container carefully, got 5 plans since update and only 2 are duplicates. Also some of the high levels dump their excess stuff on them as well. Also they often gift to new players.
---
Xbox rep is still a thing!?!?
---
If I just go to a server where my camp can be placed, will I be safe from the glitch? Or do I just not take out the fermentable items
---
They didn't take anything away, you just can't place the foundations anymore.  So you're fine, but you won't be able to rebuild or renovate.
---
I used the number for my math, but I did take the weapon out into the real world.  Even my two shot laser sniper rifle (energy damage number is low 80s) took 3 or so 15 round mags to take down a high level (60s) Super Mutant.  I'm not sure you can call a weapon a sniper rifle with such a performance (lol).
---
I get Bethesda's fear about going too far, but with the craziness of this game, and I do mostly like this game, I wish they'd just take a chance and be bold!!!
---
Your point about energy resistance is well noted though.  If many baddies have lower energy resistances then obviously, we don't need a super blowout damage figure.  However, practically, taking down high level super mutants, scorched and ghouls, I'm still not overly impressed by the weapons.  My best performance was that scorched would drop within 1 - 1 1/4 mags.
---
They increased durability, but it's far from fixed. My semi-auto laser rifle still breaks *much* faster than my combat/handmade rifles. And I mean, it breaks WAY faster.
---
Very cool theory, your observation with Lewis is intriguing because it suggests that Bethesda want the players to take these connections seriously.
---
In top of a sign behind blair nt. It's like a billboard being used as a shack. Will drink again.
---
I wonder if my Anti-armor gatling plasma will work?
---
I like these ideas. Only thing I would add is that the ‚Äúfan the hammer‚Äù or panic mods greatly increase the degrading of the revolver. It‚Äôs super powered up, but you have to use that aspect wisely. 
---
Any advice about the distribution of S.P.E.C.I.A.L points? 
---
PD: Why someone votes in negative this post? 
---
Ehh playing other games. I couldn't see myself trying it again until all their roadmap stuff is out and even then I'd be wary.
---
Oh boy I get the chance to save a soul from the corporate monster bethesda has become!
---
One quick example while my bus trip to work is ending...
---
Overhyping the game at E3 with fixes stolen from the community (basically spitting on your face) from fallout 4 and claiming it as their own work.
---
Overhype got people to buy this game from within a no refunds store because if it was sold anywhere else they would have seen a profit cut and tons of refunds which would have been met en mass with what was initially released. This false advertising (which is even seeing legal attention) is one major lie bethesda has told you.
---
Only keeping the stuff, of any level, of value.. ie worth more than 150caps.
---
the day my 76 is supposed to install a 20 GB update happens
---
I had to do the same..  I'm having a hell of a time post-patch, re-running wires that won't connect anymore and power connectors that won't place. I gave up after a while
---
The last patch seemed to imply that glitch was fixed.

Is the pip-boy *screen* blank or you can't see it at all? Try server hopping and then open your pip-boy and give it like 30-60 seconds and see if it loads, it takes a while sometimes.
---
If that doesn't work then validate the game files, that worked for someone. 
---
Ah so you have no actual lies they told and just use the generic outrage stuff that YouTubers parroted.
---
Yes, TS doesn't use more ammo but recoil can be higher depending on the weapon.

Yeah chally the moo moo didnt appreciate it. 
---
I can't speak on heavy energy weapons, but the semi-auto laser is still made out of tissue paper. The 2x durability increase barely did anything, my ballistic weapons last so much longer.
---
Thanks for reporting this issue and contributing your valuable time to bug testing this game. After past experience with this game I decided to not touch any new content when it comes out and if asked I would advise you the same.

Many of us have had a heavy weapons toon. My TS gatling was usable. After the TS nerf I had to pop a drug against high level shit but now it's decent again.
---
I am not sure, but I don't think it was in the normal category.  It's called Vintage Nukashine I believe.  I had to go to a different location than I expected to get it.  It was flagged as a quest item and cannot be dropped.
---
Make sure to look everywhere in your inventory.
---
Halo 5 which is now on game pass thankfully so not as bad of a rip off,

Underground in the Cranberry bog.
---
They are Bethesda's way of saying screw yourself lol.

I believe it is labeled as vintage nukashine in your inventory.

That I didn't know, I kind of skimmed through the patch notes.

Waiting for the community ones which I find more... reliable.

&gt;it's missing a texture for where its number should be

Yep there it is

Same, it seems scientific, bit supernatural at the same time. I hope they don't kill it with overexposure though!

Oh, yeah! I had a place there, too. You reminded me because a friend was the one pointed it out, "do... You know you have a fissure right nearby?"

My game crashes off and on when I fast travel now.

Is it just one of those "area" markers, where once you enter, it just kind of "flashes" your compass, and doesn't give you a specific point to go to.

Feed the people does this with the items.  It just says "They are somewhere in this area, good luck, have fun searching every corner and shelf for the containers".

ah ok gotcha!

Another fine patch from the FO76 team. I'm glad I logged in and logged right back out. This sucks. :(

Well, to be a contributor to r/Fallout you have to only play round-based combat Fallout and/ or have the Obsidian logo tattooed on your genitals.

And we haven't even gotten to Tank Killer providing no benefits to your laser rifle.  Which further reduces the effectiveness of energy weapons.
---
That's not saying much.
---
I've never understood the bloodied and unyielding stuff. I mean, yeah, you get the most damage, but you also turn into a glass cannon. If you get screeched at by a Scorchbeast, you're pretty much done.

Seems there is some bug involving fermenting and placing camp if spot is occupied. It disconnects you in a loop from every server. There was more details reported earlier if you can find the post.
---
Everytime i log in it says i need to build it again
---
Anyone else brave enough to try and replicate this on a character on their account?
---
It's amazing what adding 15 minutes of new content will do for a community.

I wondered about that - I couldn't remember what it was pre patch.

As it stands there is almost no reason to use a semi-auto laser rifle. I mean, I still do, because it's my favorite Fallout weapon and I'm an idiot. But when you use them you really realize just how trash they still are.
---
I'd even be fine with the current damage so long as they make armor penetration work and turn the durability WAY up.
---
No worries. But I‚Äôll still make you the arms if you need. Heading to work but in about 12 hours I can help if you want

Lol.  I absolutely agree, and in imo, many of these people have already lost it. People freak out because someone wrecked their camp with a sledgehammer, imagine what they would do if they saw you ride up on a Giga and eat it with one bite.  But then again, that game was designed for large scale raiding and and clan warfare.  Totally different concept, but like all PVP based games, you had to know what you were getting into. I believe Bethesda underestimated their player base with this game and thought most players would get on board with the PVP aspect from the start. So many of the hardcore Fallout faithful wanted something just enough different to be new. They wanted the option to play with their friends or meet different players of course, but if PVP became a situation, they wanted to be able to opt out completely if they chose. While I think it appeals to a some, the PVP mechanics as they are now, lends itself overwhelmingly to childish and petty griefing with no real consequence to those who only want to harass and bully other players. Totally separate PVP/PVE servers is the only way to really satisfy everyone I think. Then again a lot of people will complain about anything, even if you hang them with a brand new rope.
---
Sarcasm?? /S 
---
I can agree to that, as it allows people a 'get out of jail' card in case a Deathclaw or Behemoth is right on top of them, and blast them with all 6 shots. Definitely would be the talk of the team around the campfires, no doubt. 
---
You're a generation or so off: It's the gen-x'ers and late-age millennials with 3 kids and no time.
---
The boomers never took a liking to console gaming as a group, and as for PC gaming the boomers are still asking the gen-x'ers and millennials to fix their computers for them and "help them figure out how the google works".
---
I'm assuming that's regarding the Nukashine quests. I was reading that, but if that is the case then I feel dumb. I'll wait for a few more replies, but I'll go check out the posters.
---
The armor alone adds +15 to all special except END. That on top of what you have without the armor then add in your perk cards and mutations. Not hard at all to get to +40 strength. 
---
Buy the Brahmin Pen plan from a vendorbot- used to drop a lot from workshop claim rewards also.
---
It'll be just a picture of a wheelbarrow-looking thing in your CAMP resource tab to build it- looks nothing like a brahmin in the menu.
---
The event won't start til the 19th, but I'm assuming it's like all of the events that are activated when you get close to them, like the 3 events on Morgantown

Woke up and it was all black, thought it was a bug at first.  Turned out to be a random outhouse.

This has been one of the nicest online games ive played besides like 4 people. Im surprised.

When there's nothing to criticize it's... usually because there's nothing to criticize. It's fine that Bethesda's latest release has so far operated without a hitch, but that does not automatically wipe clean the state that 76 was in launch.
---
I love what happened in the new quest but felt like it was a missed opportunity.
---
It should have panned out like a fallout equivilant of the sanguine quest in skyrim , where you blacked out and had to retrace what the f@#k happened the previous night ie the hangover style lol
---
My pistols already do huge damage, I don't understand why people think they are weak... 
---
Yep, plague walker aggro's brahmin when you get close to them and they run away. One of the reasons i quit farming my mutations and just bought the right serums on the trade subs.
---
I just realized I misread the date. I appreciate the clap emojis, though. I hope it made you feel great!

In a shack on a cliff overlooking Charlestown, with a skeleton chilling on a couch out on the cliff, clutching a bottle and looking like he had a worse hangover than I did.

You‚Äôre the idiot for holding junk while being wanted, I‚Äôm sure anyone reading this has no sympathy for you in this scenario

i didnt even know spoons were a thing. maybe i dont pay enough attention to junk items.
---
"SIXTEEN TIMES THE DETAIL" "ALL NEW LIGHTING AND RENDERING" those are facts?

you may be right :) I'm not the sharpest machete on the wasteland without my morning java..
---
I was told to wait until level 50 to do the main quests so the rewards would be at level 50, so leveling up from level 1-50 I found how easy it is to relax and just explore the world, grow crops, build my CAMP to my liking, and hunt for legendary weapons.
---
Im just now finally doing the quests, so i'll be busy for a while!
---
Still is there... before you walk into town in the trailer on the skeleton holding the safe

What youtuber are you on about? No if the game wasn't shit its reputation would be fine. Look at other objectively good games and their community...

One thing I see as being woefully neglected when people talk about Mothman and the Interloper:
---
[The church in Helvetia](https://imgur.com/H6yJp75). The effigy above the altar is very distinct from any of the other churches I've come across. 
---
If you are talking about the monster at the bottom of lucky hole mine it resembles the description of Cthulhu much more closely than a deep one. A deep one looks more like a mirelurk king.
---
Just drink some of that nukashine, boy
---
Personally, I hate pvp. I love cooperative multiplayer. I feel they need to up the difficulty and intensity and make that the point again. Of course, raiders are raiders and that‚Äôs just a part of it. But lore wise, I think more vault dwellers would be helpful than bad. 
---
Obsession with pvp is bad
---
Dumping them wherever i can. I don't have the spare space in my stash to keep them and i get way more legendaries than i can sell in a single day. 
---
I'm not rich caps wise either, only got about 6k but there's nothing i want to buy so it's not really an issue. 
---
Junk = everything under 3* that i don't want to use. 
---
Just like the fertilizer thing- can collect once and then there's some sort of timer 'til it resets.
---
Ah! I forgot about that!
---
Then it would seem that my seemingly full list is not as full as it seems!
---
Lucky, u got wooden spoons!!
---
Why didn't you just travel to your camp?
---
I checked my whole inventory and it wasn't there.  
---
Then I went to my stash, scrolled through ALL of my items in the Inventory tab and IT IS THERE... How?? If it's in my inventory, how is it possible that it can't be found under any tab, other than the whole inventory tab that you see only if you open your stash...  
---
This game is still broken.
---
Same here basically, only holding onto stuff that's 2 or 3* and higher than lvl. 40 for when the legendary vendor comes to town
---
Yes, I want to make a Nuka Cola corner in my C.A.M.P.: posters, vending, stash box, a display of all the Nuka products, t51 Nuka armor armor displayed. I‚Äôm hoping that the updates will allow for nuka cola and armor to be displayed
---
Thanks and that's an 
---
interesting approach, but i have weapons that i really value that are worth less than 100 caps.  Thats why i ask.
---
S6 P12 E6 C5 I6 A13 L8
---
Mine used to be that, now I've been keeping all. With the legendary vendor coming and being able to scrap legendaries for legendaries you want. That is easily what I'm looking forward to the most. 
---
I woke up roughly a min away from a deathclaw 
---
Thanks for PSA, I was debating killing my mule until I saw this.  The not being able to eat or drink part of the fix was pretty cruel, especially when the dupers from this time period were already banned, and everyone duping now doesn't go over max weight on a character.
---
I'm keeping a few 3* legendary level 50 to trade. Ones that aren't desirable for resale here. For the upcoming vendor update. Everything else gets sold to vendors right away
---
OMG... I have it and can't drink it, because you cannot consume from the stash level and it only shows there...
---
LOL people would freak about a Giga chomping their base for sure.  It's unfortunate pvp favors griefing currently, more by design atm.  But I really think a truly pve server of this game would be boring.  Remove the threat of others and there's really not much left.  So much of how this game was designed ( and in survival games in general ) is based on dealing with the player base.  This includes raiders.  Your point about Bethesda underestimating the fan base is on point.  People heard online survival Fallout and immediately thought Fallout MMO.  Nowhere near the same.
---
Would certainly encourage people to fight them instead of relogging to a different server. Not to mention it would make me want to get tag teamed by a 3 SB squad. The amount of bullets needed to kill them justifies all SBs higher than 50 to be at least 1*
---
Happened to me on PC last night.  Other weird things too, like not seeing the notice of how many wood you've collected when scavenging, some other stuff I can't remember at the moment...
---
Atleast uncommon - rare plans
---
same, 2 \*\*\* and got gold pocket watches....  
---
You can run around whitesprings non-nuked and get about 10 legendary kills by one shotting ghouls. 
---
I think an enemy that takes tons of bullets, can kick your ass from the air, and takes a good ten minutes to kill if you're solo, should drop a legendary item. It will probably be shit anyway, but the reward now for them is total garbage
---
It did! Nothing against you personally. I have just seen so many of these posts that I reached critical mass and I had to say something for my own wellbeing. 
---
I was already using this solution.  This appears to be something entirely new since patch 7, which ended when I discontinued the custom .ini altogether.
---
I‚Äôm keeping stuff to sell. The stuff I use is in my character inv. So I guess it‚Äôs up to you, whether you‚Äôre keeping to sell or to play with..
---
It finally smoothed out after alot of login attempts, but then a major bug appeared. Now i cannot connect on my main char at all and waiting for support to answer my ticket.  Just not my lucky day or game.

Bethesda Shill!!! Why don't you go back to sucking tod's teat! i don't have to play this game to know it's garbage and anyone who says otherwise is just a fanboy. 
---
I was going to just post this as it's obvious satire but then realized i've read this comment almost verbatim before, lol. so obligatory /s
---
Discontinuing use of the custom .ini did resolve it for me, so that's probably the issue, though I'm not clear on the specifics.
---
Got knight on my first turn in of the patch! Already had initiate  
---
That has nothing to do with what I am talking about.  One person on your team starts fighting a scorch beast.  All the rest were hidden.  As soon as the scorch beast knows where the 1 attacker is then the rest of you on the team aren't hidden any more.  You could be behind the scorch beast and far away, but you're still not hidden.  When I've person on a team is detected, all are.
---
That is wrong.
---
Last time when i did get wanted by taking stuff from resource drop (first time wanted as well) I jumped quickly to my camp, stashed all junk than fast traveled to whitesprings and asked first dude I saw to simply kill me as I had wanted by mistake. He shot me down. Ive thanked him and respawn at my camp. 
---
me as well,  have rebuilt 3 times fully now and same problem. this makes the game unplayable for me. just my opinion.
---
Yes the antique store will spawn some at times can also look for BoS lab coat while there
---
To be fair, few people actually know that sentinel effect actually exists. Did you tell the guy you had sentinel armour? You could have perhaps saved Bethesda support the effort of reading another BS reportü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Near the mothman museum. Next to 2 skeletons sitting on toilets. 2 guns at their feet.

I stopped excepting trade requests. No, I do not want to sell my main melee weapon and BOS outfit.

ash heap on top of some scaffolding
---
224 hours, I had to ask a newb friend to come help me launch! 
---
I mean yea they take a while to kill. But even as a melee character I don't mind them anymore. The Sonic attack isn't relentless and can be occasionally dodged. And they provide a small challenge for a chance to drop some nice plans. Not a big chance, but there are so many to farm I think that's balanced. 
---
Agreed.
---
It's because you are looking in the wrong tabs when you try browsing your normal inventory, but looking in ALL when browsing your Stash.
---
When I first started it, went to the "N"s in Aid looking for the drink, panic'd when I couldn't find it.  But then found it under Vintage, in another tab, Misc maybe?  It's been 12 hours, plus it caused me to blackout.  I cannot recall much beyond initially panicing when I couldn't find it but realizing my mistake shortly after.
---
Whoa!  Can you remember the area?  Looks like I have exploring to do...
---
But now I have 8S, there is some method to reset it?
---
And another question, I have Charisma 3 but any cards of Lone Wanderer there is some method to get that perk card without upgrade Charisma? Because I know that you get a perk card pack every two lvl, but it's so random ..

Drills and syringers üòñ
---
I don't use energy rifles or pistols, all I have is a gatlin plasma and it's a bloodied one but it's amazing now. Just hate it when it turns things into a pile of goo and there's no loot. 
---
The point wasn't about pistols being 'weak', it's about them lacking 1. Proper modifications to give people more variety of revolvers to keep on their playstyle, and 2. adding a function to allow them to have a high DPS capability, as they suffer with slow rate of fire and against large group of enemies. 
---
I've noticed it off/on with my Lever Action.  But could never be certain if it was really unloading itself or if I logged off with like... 1 bullet in the chamber.
---
I'm just curious..if I didn't see someone who was stalking me, or was by various means, invisible to me, if I crouched would I get a [Detected] indicator?
---
Are you seriously claiming that a bunch of clickbait youtubers **didnt** enforce lies and spread misinformation about this game?
---
you been living under a rock?
---
Yeah, kinda bummed that i you go a pound over 1200 and die you automatically lose all junk.
---
Better option would be to then not drop anything.
---
I melee'ed several and had the same experience.  I took minimal or no damage (Sentinel armor, dense and have fireproof perk)  The loot showed for a split second but then they disappeared.  Maybe they were throw really far, but I didn't see it.  Blast killed other robots in the area.
---
More like batteries in this case.
---
Did you check in another tab, other than Aid?  Like MISC?
---
I checked all tabs, and it's not under any tab.
---
HE COMES
---
* Sixteen times the size
---
* Very big map
---
* Possibly one of the most interesting and varied maps in the entire Fallout franchise
---
* New lighting and rendering is true, because it would HAVE to be to accommodate for a multiplayer game
---
Well, considering that I get a little irked when my bloodied sledgehammer doesn't one shot 68th level super mutants, that sounds a little under powered.
---
But yeah it's probably not fair to pass judgment on energy weapons until you've maxxed out all the relevant perks and find they still suck.
---
I'm getting the same on my lever action -xbox
---
Personally i think it‚Äôs a complete waste. Blocker reduces melee dmg taken, and since you one shot everything as bloody...
---
I have ammo out the ass but I got nothing in return, oh wow I got a brain and some bones look at home much I‚Äôm going to use it.
---
I believe I may have found that key last night. I found some Dome Key in a locker that was fallen over in the Nuka Cola factory. It was in the room where they took surveys about the products. Sorry if that is not #7.
---
I saw a post about the fermenter causing inaccessibility to your character. Something about leaving fermented alcohol in it then server hopping. 
---
I had this issue too but it seems to have gone now. I am on PC.
---
I can second this, I live on glowing meat steaks &amp; they were spoiling fast. 
---
He said 4x the size and for4. Lighting and rendering was proven to be be ripped from a modder. I put quotes around my statement for what Todd said verbatim. 
---
Also a lie about the 200 dollar collectors edition having a canvas bag.
---
You can relocate specials after level 50. Regarding the perk selection, check the center bottom of your screen when you select perk cards during level up. There you should see filters and button prompts how to change the filter. For consoles it is R1/L1 (PS4) and RB/LB (Xbone), not sure about PC. It took me a while to realize it, but you basically can select perks completely indipendant from the selected special.
---
Yes. Noticed it before this patch as well. Confirmed it today and was planning to make a post.
---
Your screenshots only show you checking you Aid menu while viewing Pipboy.  But checking your full inventory menu while viewing your Stash.
---
Also have trade issues now with other players, sometimes it just doesn't work, either they or I can't go into trade
---
hi mate, im on PC but i have the same Problem i cant login one of my Characters, but all others Characters working fine.
---
Did you joined a server were your CAMP wasnt able to be placed, cause I think its maybe related to the issue.
---
also this could be related:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ytb6/game\_breaking\_fermenter\_bug\_do\_not\_do\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ytb6/game_breaking_fermenter_bug_do_not_do_this/) 
---
im currently waiting for a constructiv response from bethesda support and not asking me if i restarted my router or assume i tried to play while server maintenance...
---
that Rad Ant Lager for the yesterday's challenge, frustrating. 
---
Just as long as you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre 100% right either.
---
I'll see if I can find it later on! 
---
Are you using mods?
---
Better Inventory perhaps? 
---
I meant All Night Long. Didn't think about the camp one. 
---
What's your current carry weight?
---
but shouldn't that be the way? i never understood why the haters were here to begin with. If you don't like the game, cool, don't play it. why would you hang out in a sub for a game that you hate, downvoting every post and telling everyone how stupid they are for liking something you dont? I don't like mustard but i'm not spending all my time in r/mustard calling everyone an idiot and a shill. 
---
It‚Äôs almost like the loot got worse.
---
you should come back to it, it has improved quite a lot
---
Was it the paint job?
---
I do.
---
&gt;The game is broken and showed me the item under Aid but ONLY after sorting to Chems... So it was but wasn't there. Don't ask. 
---
Some sort of PC Inventory management mod causing issues?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a giver upper. Love the game but the content is still not enough and there are still bugs that have existed since day one. 
---
I‚Äôm excited for the new content but I was more excited when they had announced it back in December. This update doesn‚Äôt feel like much since I‚Äôve completed most of the content already in the game, this feels like a small free DLC. Especially when there are still major bugs that prevent me from doing certain things, like building. 
---
I‚Äôll probably wait another 3-6 months before playing again. 
---
Try switching guns and back. I had this happen with my black powder rifle last week.
---
I had the same experience, very sparse spawns, not many lagandaries and relogging didn't seem to work to get a full respawn. Hardly any legendary items either! 
---
That's the key for the Nuka Cola Dome, aka TNT Dome 3 (\[spoiler\] where you can find the Nuka Cola paint job for the T-51 \[/spoiler\]).
---
Man you love dmg resist haha.... personally i think points are better spent with lifegiver (+45 health, 4 points) and solar powered (3end,3strenth) i feel the added health and strength are a lot more helpful paired with dodgy and nerd rage 
---
I noticed the game was a little more unstable than normal.  A few mid game freezes and choppy frame rates here and there.  I'm on a PS4 pro.
---
Judging by the fact that it constantly changes shape and that you're in The Mire. My bet is that its an Angler spit that was aimed at the Scorchbeast and missed.
---
Lol I promise you, yes. 
---
The steps to walk up to the front door, with the 2-3 dead BoS soldiers strewn about. They were basically impossible to walk up normally. You always had to jump to get on them even though it should operate you know, like normal steps, lol. 
---
215 without and 325 with PA. Carrying 168 pounds so I still have a lot of space.
---
Yea, I‚Äôm also getting HORRIBLE frames. Looks like a flipbook
---
Cheers, still annoying to waste that .45 ammo, that's rare on my character
---
Yes, and I did the fix to stop falling through the textures. Is there another one required too?
---
Never seen it sold ever (320,110,87) find it regularly at forward station delta next to the mini gun spawn 
---
That's like three caps each. 
---
Someone posted a picture of them getting the T-60 BOS Knight paint plan yesterday from Tech Data turn ins.  
---
That actually did always bug me too. . . I mean not enough to post about them when they were broken. But definitely enough to comment "GOOD JOB!", now that they are fixed.
---
I've always said travel between train stations should be free.  Not to or from, just between.
---
My CAMP was apparently in a no-build area... or maybe there was something wrong with my CAMP, I have no idea.  I was next to a scene where I could imagine Nukashine might transport players and ended up moving to the north.  Notably, I wasn't able to re-place my existing CAMP, even though it was a single-foundation CAMP, so there could have been something weird with how I built it.
---
OMG I didnt know that, thank you so much my friend :)
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs instanced since it‚Äôs linked to your stash. I wouldn‚Äôt see how it‚Äôd make much since if they could see what you have in there. I‚Äôm sure the one in your CAMP acts as their own when they access it. 
---
Yeah, I found out because that's where I've had my camp since the first day of beta. Haha real shocker there!
---
I have noticed the no damage bug has been more frequent
---
Could try removing the mod all together and see if it works as expected.
---
I don't have an extreme build but I can kill scorched beasts with about a clip from my rifle,so yeah, once you hit a good level and figure out your build, they really aren't a threat, just an annoyance. 
---
you mean a 15 minute questline isnt enough to suck you back forever!?
---
"You! Stop! You!" When I got close to it, it would just stop talking but nothing happened. My character is lvl5, it followed me from 1st town to the second Overseer's diary town (Sorry I don't know the names of the places yet.). Trying to interact with it didn't work, so i took a photo and left.
---
I previously was only keeping items level 45 or 50, with 2 or more stars.
---
But yesterday I decided "fuck it" and made a mule account. So now I'm just saving literally everything. 
---
When the legendary vendor comes I'll see if there's any use at all for less than top-quality legendaries, and worst case I have a bunch banked to sell, or use when leveling alts.
---
Exactly. I never put a ton of thought into it until I ran up there smooth. Pleasant surprise. 
---
Well maybe I like being a walking cinder block plus practically the entire build besides strength and luck is personal preference and I like rushing people avoiding damage.
---
r/unexpectedskyrim
---
I went there y after the patch yesterday and the legendary numbers were very low! 
---
Dude..help a fellow traveler
---
You haven't seen the extended roadmap that hasn't been released.
---
After this roadmap.  Comes...
---
"Sky Vault"
---
Yea I‚Äôll hunt ya too! Gt please? 
---
I too have spent a lot of time in build mode on a base PS4.  Haven‚Äôt installed the update yet, but you got me worried.  Is it consistently bad or just occasionally?
---
How do mules even work? 
---
Do you use two controllers?
---
Play only one at a time?
---
 (Both of which seem like a lot of work)
---
I don't want to have a mule character....just understand how it works.
---
I did that last night at a friends camp but do not remember doing it this morning when playing guess I‚Äôll play on my second thanks a lot for the response! 
---
I also found a hybrid, a protectron with robobrain treads instead of legs.
---
How long did it take to go? Any fixes you tried? 
---
I found this guy near the Philippi cemetery and he had plans for an outfit that you can craft with 3 cloth and 1 gold that you can sell for 25 caps (with unyielding maxxing out my cha).
---
So gold is super valuable to me now. 
---
I feel like everything is lacking unless it is a legendary with a damage multiplier of at least 125%.
---
Vampire and Suppressor legendary effects just allow you to take less damage while your weapons take forever to kill mobs.
---
srsly.  #goals.
---
Yup me too since Christmas anyway, the SB attacks are better after the last patch. I‚Äôm
---
Finally powerful enough to not die 25 times trying to kill a single one. 
---
A lot of my friends hate on the game have never played, they just boycotted it going by the meta reviews. 
---
Initially the outrage was mostly warranted but they had most breaking bugs fixed in couple months. 
---
Indeed, what is the point?
---
Is the point, that few dozes of 10 account, max chars per account whatever that limit is, "players", are selling it all? Because they got nearly everything?
---
The point? So trading is primary by you and few players like you?
---
Just deal with it. 
---
Plus in all likehood. Bethesda has made limits. Initially due to various bugs , the limits didn't actually exits, only on "paper". Now they have on and on made those limits more enforced. You think they are stopping here? Maybe, but they can perfectly continue to squeeze more.
---
Goals.
---
So the legendary us investing in your future? Hmm deep
---
If software always has bugs, then it is incumbent on Bethesda to test for them since there must be bugs.  Does anything in the last 4 months give you any confidence they test a single thing before just releasing it and hoping for the best?
---
I get the same thing I have a support ticket open now and I sent them your youtube link for more evidence. The worse part is I can literally log in with any of my other characters on my account except my main. So far I cleared cache and I uninstall and then re installed FO. If you hear of a way to get around this please let me know, 
---
I just spammed the interact command on Biv. Might have a timer since doing the first quest though
---
I woke up in a tree. There was a caps stash nearby, which was nice.
---
Happened to me last night then later on a different server someone launched 3 on fissure prime. I was able to launch one on again a different server after that. 
---
Everytime I go, and I havent tested post patch, but most legendary items drop from enemies that never say they are legendary. 
---
Oh great, that's what it was.  I'd just forgotten it was even installed.
---
Tried for over an hour at three known spots and at the new vault up in the NW.  It's fixed, and I think the ceiling placement glitch is fixed too.
---
I really really wanted to see what was in that new vault, and see what updates they made to the other three, but it looks like we'll need to wait!  Oh well, good job Bethesda, that one really did need to get fixed I suppose.
---
No, they are common enemies and clearly not loot pinatas.  Not everything has to be worth killing.
---
I love that goat mask staring at the Sheepsqatch!!
---
Were u in the original frat house? i picked up the nuka shine went to the second frat house fro the password and it wouldn't let me drink it until i got inside the first frat house or it didnt show up until then.
---
My first thought was the switch to Daylight Saving Time, but it seems like we would have seen reports of this prior to Patch 7 if that was the case.
---
Right OK, so ammo switching I can agree with. Not so sure about fire rate though, I'd probably switch to a different pistol for that. I guess they can't change that stuff too much as they do such large damage, if you increase fire rate they go completely OP.
---
My revolvers do roughly 2x the damage of my rifles so that's the big reason I can't really see a huge buff coming, it wouldn't make sense to give them faster fire rate too. 
---
&gt; Lighting and rendering was proven to be be ripped from a modder
---
You can't rip lighting and rendering. It's engine based. And modders have never been able to change the way previous bethesda games do lighting and rendering. They can make it look slightly different like with enbs, but you're never actually changing the way the game engine handles things. 
---
I'm guessing you're one of those that said skyrim special edition was literally the same as original skyrim and said that mods can make old skyrim look like that. Despite special edition using volumetric lighting and fog which was literally impossible on the original.
---
Better Inventory needed an update - not sure if it has been released yet.
---
Reg2k made it abundantly clear in the nexus page that due to the changes introduced in the latest patch his mod would need an update and exhorted users to disable it until the time such update was available.
---
Just a hunch: do you have game mods?
---
BOS knight is in, i sold a plan for 3k yesterday of it
---
if I had 2 PS4's i'd create an alt; otherwise, its just a pain to get a friend to help you unload stuff.
---
How do you use your alt to transfer stuff?
---
mutations like eagle eye
---
I have the same name as on here. I'm at least a month older and have a lvl 161 and a lvl 16. I have the same problem. Not many left of the old friends. I've mostly been soloing.
---
Agreed as they're killable in seconds. I think the occasional one should be legendary like everything else but not all of them.
---
From the description it sounds like it is safe as long as you don't try to remove an item from your Stash that is flagged as being in the Fermenter, while your Fermenter doesn't exist (due to CAMP placement).
---
So as long as you just hop to another server with your CAMP placed, it should be OK.
---
Test post-patch, you may find it different. I'm still trying to work it out. I was there and it was deffo different! 
---
Yeah, firecracker berries are much more visible too and glow red at night. I really like the changes they've made to some harvestable plants.
---
No, no mods. 
---
from the other replies, seems like random.  
---
My two teammates...lvl43 woke up just north of Gorge Bridge, lvl 112 near the  Charlestown train station.
---
At least they can get this bug fixed now before adding this feature to all the "Display" items in the future.
---
Everything tastes like purple.  
---
Still there and what are the prices for them
---
If a character is so overencumbered that they have to destroy items and they die, all loot on that character is destroyed, regardless of how close to the limit they were.
---
In the last 4 months we've had 7 patches that continuously fix bugs and seen bethesda employees active on this subreddit responding to bug reports.
---
And yes, software **always** has bugs. It is literally impossible to create software, let alone a game, that is completely bug free.
---
i 100% agree with you here. The lucky hole creature didnt strike me as looking anything like what a deep one would (or should anyways) 
---
Yeah, that would work for me if the odd one every now  and then was a ledge but if they all are people would just camp the spawns imo
---
Because simply tearing you down isn't good enough for folks like that. they want you to either watch in despair or log off. It's a dick move. 
---
I keep my extractors, purifier, and door locked (some mobs can open doors). My pad is still accessable if you have marsupial, there is a simple water pump and plenty of crops available so it isn't a total loss to anyone who happens by. That said when I finally obtained a rad cleanser (maybe.. LOL)  I will likely keep it stored when I'm not in camp unless Bethesda allows me to make wall mounted laser turrets and incendiary turrets along with a heavy radiation mine.
---
Never log out with items still fermenting!
---
About an hour. I didn't do anything. I don't know why one of your characters could be loaded, though. I have only one cgaracter so I had no way to try that.
---
There should be a ‚Äúno trade‚Äù emote instead of just deferring to the thumbs down.  I trade with other players (mostly shotgun ammo) and usually the experience is OK.  If they don‚Äôt want to trade, I back away and give them a thumbs up.   I have given thumbs down to a player if they want to charge me like 10 caps per shell or if they do stupid shit like build their turret camp outside of WS golf club.  Or if I am in the process of getting ganked for no reason.  
---
No worries thanks
---
I can't use any of my legendary weapons that have the "25% faster fire rate" because they all heal more than they damage the enemy if I hold the trigger down.  If I fire short bursts it works as expected most of the time but if I wanted to do that I wouldn't be using a fully automatic weapon. I try them again after every patch (since last year) and unfortunately I am still waiting for them to work as expected.
---
I just getting wanted 30 caps because I shot  ghouls with shotgun  who escape side mission to attack someone farm... I should get reward for save farm...
---
I cant complain with the legendary robots in watoga but i noticed, the explode right away when you destroy them. 
---
For awhile I was getting decent plan drops from them, so it wasn't that bad, but it seems they've stopped dropping really anything of worth for me.
---
As for Lucky Hole, has anyone been able to get through that door to the left of the entrance that says barred from within? I spent way too much time assuming that was an exit shortcut but could never find a path that led to it. 
---
it seemed consistent, once i go into build mode the frames start to drop immediately, you can still build, but turning around too fast really makes the game choppy.
---
It clearly states in the roadmap that it starts on the 19th
---
Nah, they way too easy to kill once u get Up in levels
---
TNT Dome 2, find a key, say hello, explore....
---
If that‚Äôs the case then whitespring needs some big fixing. It would make much more sense to have scorchbeasts drop legendaries rather then getting 5-7 legendaries from a single run through whitespring 
---
And r/lowsodiumanthem is the equivalent of r/fo76filthycasuals xD
---
Its honestly like de ja vu. Seeing the farewall posts, the splinter sub, the eeirly similar discussions. I had no idea I was signing up for round 2 lol
---
Yea I‚Äôm stuck at like 10-15.
---
The first non quest one I  noticed was at The Whitespring shopping area. I used the stash box next to it, turned around, then turned back around for a double take. It makes sense there is one there because of all yhe other stations, but I was not expecting it. Even has a nice placard above it.
---
Not even an inventory management one?  Seems that one really messed things up in the last patch due to them changing a lot with the inventory system.
---
Dodgy and nerd rage are both core for bloody builds... and an extra 3-10% mitigation on a 60 dmg attack from a mob is absolutely not on the same level as an extra 45 flat health increase. 
---
I get a daily quest every day, but I don't get every single daily quest.
---
Is that really the intent?  I don‚Äôt think so.
---
Shit happens. Some players try to gank you for no reason.  It‚Äôs part of the game.  But unless they are harassing or threatening you over and over I don‚Äôt see the point. 
---
I have one door locked but open. It's to the room I sleep in. I also have a powered door with the code lock. It's to my reactor and rad shower. Apparently the reactor and rad shower were prime targets for griefers and after getting to know what they cost to rebuild I hid them away. It's sad as I would have liked to help wanderers to get rid of their rads.
---
Could said sky vaults be a circle? Would they then have rims? Sky rims?
---
Sounds like something a commie would say, I completed the basic training 
---
There is another vault under construction, somewhere south of Lake Eloise that also has the boxes and such right out front.
---
Sweeeeetttt
---
Thanks a lot!
---
"Fermentable"
---
They were using a PC inventory mod that was incompatible with filtering of the Aid tab, apparently.
---
I‚Äôve got 2 planes in my box what‚Äôs a good price?
---
What about paladin?
---
It‚Äôs an issue and Bethesda is aware. 
---
Nah nothing
---
Ah OK, thanks
---
* PC Player, so I just bought a second account. 
---
* Launch my main game through launcher per normal. Launch second window using exe file, and manually log in.
---
* Once logged into both accounts I friend requested myself, join my alt's game, fast travel to the train station they're parked at.
---
* If there are people around I'll either wait, or just open trade window and painstakingly set all prices at 0, and "buy" things with my alt.
---
* If there's nobody around I'll drop everything in a cash register or similar "no max weight" container, then just grab it all with the alt.
---
And that's that, quick and easy transfer of items to storage. Then I can just log the mule out, or I can switch characters on my main account and get an item back if it was something I wanted to trade between my actual characters I play with.
---
Much more reliable than trusting randoms or having to wait for a friend to be online to either hold the item for you or lock a server you can jump back to and pick an item up you dropped in a container somewhere.
---
Yeah there are tons of shill youtubers out there that are in a way paid to promote the game. Lots of shill media groups do that. Lots of media groups and youtubers who aren't lying either. I dont see your point.
---
Given how bad Mirelurk Queens can be, a Mirelurk Empress?
---
Ahh gotcha. Seems like PC mods are causing allot of issues with this update
---
I got knight last night, so it‚Äôs in the game 
---
nuke it.
---
Radicool, mutations, chems/food/drinks, bobbleheads, underarmours etc. 
---
My strength is base 15, but goes up to 30+ depebding what armours i am rocking. Helps in a team too, as there is a perk that adds 2 to every stat if i remember?
---
First one took me on top of the red rocket in Flatwoods.
---
Second one I landed up in a ditch in the cranberry bog, next to a gnome. 
---
I'm just grateful I'm high enough level to cope with cranberry bog!
---
It wasn't mentioned in the patch notes and posts in this sub indicate that the issue is still present.
---
/u/Valseek or /u/Ladydevann - I see there were some quest changes and fixes to some bugs users experience with the Events. Any update on when we can see Daily: Heart of the Enemy being fixed? I'm still experiencing this since launch.
---
Info on the bug can be found in the ticketed information below:
---
----------------------------
---
Platform: PC
---
Ticket ID: 181207-001720
---
Problem: - Heart of the Enemy quest shows in the completed section and not active in my quest list, but cannot start the quest upon reading the Mission Orders.
---
How long has this issue occurred: - 60+ Day. I have only been able to start/complete this quest on two attempts within the first few days of launch. This issue has persisted through multiple days/logouts/server restarts.
---
Steps Performed: - Read Senior Knight Wilson's terminal (may not be required as the quest starts with the Mission Orders). - Read note "Mission 099-01 Orders" at Fort Defiance, but unable to pick it up. Quest does not start. - Went to Vault-Tec University, accessed the terminal which shows that I know the password. This indicates the quest is currently active. - Terminal and Analyzer show that they is waiting for a viable scorchbeast sample to process. - There are no quest markers on the map, and no scorchbeasts are marked for extraction.
---
Needed Resolution: Need the option to again start Daily: Heart of the Enemy.
---
Video Confirmation of Bugged Quest: https://youtu.be/1CDkJ7hX-1M
---
Yes you can rip code that someone created in the same engine and place it in a different game with the same engine and it works.
---
If you run shotguns skeet shooter in perception will help with narrowing the spread and increasing range, useful if you run stealth because you can justfiy adding a suppressor.
---
Well, this is a lot different than joining the scorched earth event and fighting the queen...
---
Egg head = +6 INT
---
Im gonna guess you didnt order one
---
I‚Äôm level 128 right now have a pretty good build and weapons, it‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre too hard, it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre more of a challenge than any other enemy in the game IMO. The ghouls in whitesprings are super easy to kill and farm, but drop the most loot on average, wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to have the much more durable and damaging enemy drop more Loot than a ghoul that can be two shotted?
---
I wondered why for only like maybe the 2nd time in like 5 months I found some. The other time was like 1. Last night I found like 15 . . . In one location. Crazy.
---
I have only personally received Initiate, and only turned in once since the last update yesterday.  And only seen the Knight paint screenshot posted.
---
Never thought of underarmour. Which one adds specials?
---
I don't know if this is a problem with the Polish version fo76, but sometimes it happens that the names of enemies are correctly in Polish and sometimes it happens that one or two enemies have a English names (problem also applies to items).
---
If it‚Äôs wood armor, it stays on the body. Anything else gets sold or put in a suitcase at a train station 
---
still there, the robot sell the recipes for 100-150 caps
---
Personally I think nuking fissure sites should produce legendary scorchbeasts. It'd make it worth nuking places other than prime or whitespring for one.
---
A member of our community made the code that was delivered to you via a mod that enhanced the lighting and rendering in fallout 4. That same code is found in fo76.
---
Came here to say this. One of my mates had a camp above the substation, deathclaw and ants spawned almost all the time there
---
Then... you're not one of the people I'm talking to. If you have no idea, I'm not asking you.
---
I'm asking those who DO know why.
---
It's...right there... in the thread title.
---
My character is much the same, so the brewing system is something she/I don't really care about.
---
Interesting theory, I didn't think of that possibility. That being said, all my crafting stations are on the roof of my base lol.
---
You on Xbox?
---
That is *for sure* Mothman though. 
---
Owl head (Most popular theory for the "Real" explanation), clearly moth wings on the wall behind it.
---
I believe that it is not possible to start it yet. It will be available soon.
---
Did you have the same problem where your C.A.M.P. couldn't be placed and you had fermentables sitting in your fermenter?
---
I also received the Knight paint for handing in technical documents roughly 2hrs ago. I've been handing in technical documents on and off for the past week and I didn't receive the Knight paint until today.
---
&gt;Probably already have been answered somewhere, but how do you Trigger this fatsnach event?
---
You wait until the event begins on March 19th ;)
---
Roadmap gives you the date for all the content.
---
I play since yesterday, after the character creation I had the same mistake directly, I'm from Germany and have unity media, is there no solution?
---
I have the forest enclave one and it adds +3 strength, +2 PER
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/
---
That's not what I asked.  I asked whether there has been any indication that Bethesda tests for these bugs BEFORE pushing out this game and subsequent patches, since as you acknowledge there are sure to be bugs.  The answer, of course, is no.  We've had patches obviously re-glitch old problems, like the now legendary lockpick weight one where even the slightest amount of patch verification would have noticed the problem.  We've had major bugs, like VATS missing 100% of the time if you fire "too quickly," that were evident to players during the beta but that somehow weren't fixed for 4 months.  There are hundreds of other examples of players quickly finding major bugs through normal gameplay, bugs that would have been identified and corrected had there been any sort of competent QC.  The simple truth is that we are the bug team.  As their customers that is completely ridiculous, like people who buy cars being expected to act as crash test dummies.
---
It seems like the safest option right now is either not to use the fermenter or server hop until your camp can be placed (in addition to never interacting with or removing the drinks you put in your fermenter via the stash).
---
It's not available yet. This question has been answered numerous times, it doesnt start till next week. 
---
gotta glitch in and see if they added more stuff, i remember glitching in on December and most of them were empty
---
But then wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to nerf the loot from whitesprings ghouls? Since launch large number of nuked ghouls have been ridiculously easy to farm for legendaries. I‚Äôd rather farm the tougher enemy to get the good loot drops rather than farm the most easily killed enemies in the game 
---
To be fair, he probably doesn‚Äôt realize that you are using legit armor and not some kind of hack. After all... why would Bethesda make armor where you can stand in one spot and not die lol. It was most likely just ignorance on his part and malicious intent.
---
Here's an idea, don't cheat.
---
You can.  There is a drink collect option just like you were at a river
---
Innit. I remember the outpouring of negativity from YouTubers after the ‚ÄòAdpocalypse‚Äô. If advertisers ditching YouTube because of unsavoury content wasn‚Äôt an opportunity for a period of reflection, I don‚Äôt know what is.
---
I appreciate that consumers are fatigued by microtransactions and games released before they‚Äôre ready, but we all have a tendency to take our criticism of one developer too far because we‚Äôre fed up with the mistakes of another. 
---
In the case of Fallout 76, we had a janky launch followed by a snowball of criticism because of the canvas bag, Nuka Dark Rum, dodgy data protection and an underwhelming, expensive leather jacket. The game itself was improving but being overshadowed by dodgy merchandise and a lack of quality control - across both the game and the bloody merch. We can all laugh at the woes and bumps in the road without declaring that something is a ‚Äòdead game‚Äô.
---
Some of these doom merchants on YouTube even make me regret some of my past criticism of developers.
---
Did they heal? I always had the impression that there are many "fake" legendary enemies arround. They won't heal at low health and also don't drop legendary items. And then there are seemingly non-legendary enemies dropping legendary stuff.
---
Exactly, I don‚Äôt get how farming scorchbeasts would be considered easier farming than nuked ghouls 
---
oh, sorry forget to write it, PC
---
The game is stable now.   The new content roadmap reflects an understanding that a continuous dribble of new fun is necessary.   This new content is not a massive release itself but us part of a pattern of consistent new content.  
---
Lesson #1 - if you get wanted status dump your junk ASAP.  If you know you will get wanted, dump if beforehand.
---
Lesson #2- if you get wanted, don‚Äôt fast travel to your camp.  Chances are someone will swoop in and wreck your camp and steal your shit as well. 
---
At the end of the day, you lost 10 caps. Who cares?  It‚Äôs pretty common knowledge you can‚Äôt take someone else‚Äôs drop.  
---
I blew up a dudes turret camp at WS golf club and got a 290 cap bounty.  Best 290 I ever spent and I let a low level player pick it up.  
---
I agree with that, completely. If a nuke on a fissure created a mini queen fight with a 2* SB that'd be nice. 
---
Hey there! Hopping in this real quick to let you know I saw this thread and I am looking into this. I may reach out to you via DM for more info.
---
On the video, it shows him spawned in due south of the antique shop in cranberry bog.
---
I think he might be joshing you.
---
Well, you have to nuke the ghouls first... 
---
Sorry:
---
9 alt 1500 + 9 800p stash = 20.000p worth of goods. 
---
"Build a stockpile"......
---
Give me a break. 
---
I'll have to check the plants on carpets.  Last night I put a water pump on a mat and was able to bring it inside.
---
While I agree this sucks, I think it's harsh to expect Beth to have found this, it's not exactly a simple task to trigger. 
---
Team members CAN build at your C.A.M.P.  What they cannot do, however, is EDIT or STORE the owner's placed objects.
---
Have you run WS since the patch? 
---
did you do anything thats explaind here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ytb6/game\_breaking\_fermenter\_bug\_do\_not\_do\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ytb6/game_breaking_fermenter_bug_do_not_do_this/) ?
---
do you haven an idea what cause your character to not be able to connect to a server?
---
and what did you do just before the issue appeared?
---
also would be interesting if your camp was able to be placed before the bug appeared to you.
---
Lol ok thanks tho
---
You're right. Brain fart!
---
I'm wondering if the reset clock is glitches, and you have to launch from an unused silo on a fresh server.
---
Hahahahaha it‚Äôs Fasnacht  not ‚Äú Fat Snatch‚Äù
---
Civil War Top Hats, then all the addictive Chems my character doesn't use, Rad-X, and junk Legendaries.
---
The latter ends up being an issue if I clear out vendor Caps too early on the weekends.  I've nowhere to get rid of heavy Legendaries I don't want, so I have to time things carefully.
---
So an entitled modder that thinks he invented a rendering method.
---
Doubt 
---
A simulation.  A vault located in orbit.  Running a virtual world.  Each person started as an individual in a land of snow and ice.  
---
I drop them off in the Flatwood Church Overseer's cache.  Plenty of new people.
---
People use them differently of course.  I used to open up instance of my game from my Microsoft Surface tablet and access when I playing (on my Xbox).  Xbox controllers work on it as well. Now I just use another xbox (son pays also so we have 4 in the house).  Just drop the loot in a container and pick it up.  Its takes about 3 minutes to load system and game, etc, the other part is about a minute.  I keep mine at Whitesprings station.  Its handy for whitesprings runs.   If you do the Uranium Fever event you get about 900 lbs of stuff from a single event (20+ Mole miner gautlets plus other stuff).  You can save junk on this character, you can log onto it once a day and sell 200c of this crap to the vendor.  I store all the legendaries from these events here, heavy weapons, fusion cores I picked up.
---
Was able to get a couple others to jam with me yesterday!  I'm on the piano.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/jTYm7ud](https://imgur.com/a/jTYm7ud)
---
I've equipped the craziest outfit I could find and sat at a distance with a chainsaw before to lower levels.  Didn't try to kill them, just creep them out LOL
---
So the new update just allows you to craft the alcohol that was already in game. There are new recipes that give you better buffs but you need to unlock them by doing the daily quests for bim. 
---
Have you been to WS since the patch? I nuked it yesterday and it was lean to say the least! 
---
Party boy/girl can yield another 6str if you drink whiskey.
---
So "support" got back to me, and told me the equivalent of unplug and plug back in (reboot) my computer and update my graphics driver.........   Totally ignored the fact I have multiple machines this ONE character wont load for and all other chars will.  I purposefully have not installed the latest driver as it gives me more issues on other games but for the sake of this support ticket ill install it just so they cant blame the user aka me.  
---
So just to shut them up on blaming the user I am fully updating my system right down to every little driver, just so they will FINALLY look into this properly, and when it still wont load as I guarantee it wont, I cant wait to see how they handle this.  
---
I bought the game twice
---
Yay!  Ladydevann to the rescue!  This one sounds like a doozy.
---
Put a nice dress
---
Put away your gun
---
Wave multiple times
---
Stop the object and keep pointing at it
---
That's what I do. 
---
Sledgehammer their head if they don't listen.
---
I tried that at Aaronholt a few times last night. Kept getting the same 3 pieces (both legs and a chest piece) then it switched to T-45 so I went to bed. I‚Äôll keep trying if no one has a spare on here.
---
I was able to one-shot low level enemies. I didn‚Äôt get enough time to test much. 
---
It seriously needs a sight mod too, but I guess that can wait until after bug fixes. I found it darn near impossible to aim in first person. 
---
Nah, we're all just shills and fanbois trying to pretend we didn't waste our money on this literally completely broken game.
---
Or at least that's what they tell me.
---
Cool, thanks. I‚Äôll be on after 6pm eastern today.
---
At lvl 65 I solo'd 3 at one time. Not particularly challenging aside from running out of bullets and having to melee the last one.
---
It's a big deal in a SBQ fight, or any other time you get mobbed. You one-shot everything as bloodied, but everything is a real threat to you.
---
Is there a way to pre-emptively "fix" things so you can't get in this situation? I put stuff in my fermenter last night before signing off. If I log in today and it loads normally, can I immediately go to my fermenter and remove the items from *that* menu - and will that save me from the problem?
---
you are typically put into a new server. if the person persists, you can block them, then change servers to make sure they don't try to follow you
---
I dont know about you but the Harpoon gun really needs a buff. Its base version requires 2 shots to kill regular Scorch even with 60% Heavy Weapon.
---
&gt;  low and behind 
---
Lo and behold.
---
You getting autocorrected?
---
that's not the intended use of the report system.
---
yes, this needs to be fast tracked as the new patch broke it
---
It was always blown way out of proportion but the hate was selling views.  Game was always good, but it just for a lot better and will continue to do so.
---
If you are a melee build and only carry limited ammo then they dont land. It's a bitch even at level 200 
---
I think so. Honestly it was working completely fine for me up until my C.A.M.P. couldn't be placed. I think if you server hop until your C.A.M.P. places you should be able to just remove them from the fermenter and be completely safe.
---
Good job, Bethesda!
---
That's not a lot of information to go on, bud. Why'd you leave on day one?
---
nope, im on ps4 and cant inspect
---
I agree they should have atleast a chance of dropping a legendary. Plenty of times I have gotten legendary drops off enemies with no star or legendary title. Conversely, i have killed plenty of tagged legendaries who dropped no weapon or armor. Predominantly this happens in whitesprings. I really don't understand why anyone would oppose this. Are you going to seriously sit there with a straight face and tell me it's harder to farm legendaries in whitesprings and watoga than it would be if scorchbeasts had them on their loot table? 
---
My house is small but not gimmicky. No bugs exploited. I just sucked it up and rebuilt. But now I'm consistently getting a message cannot place item: nothing is selected. Trying to put a couch down, clearly have it selected and it's green so it should be good to go. Getting a bit frustrated 
---
The distance required between CAMPS can be very long.  I know when my CAMP cannot be placed it's usually a person way off in the distance by a Lake I cannot see from my CAMP.
---
Plus, if a person logs out afterward, you won't see it.
---
There are the occasions where a location glitches.  I was on the very edge of the map once.  Built a nice CAMP.  Then it was not allowed to place ever, because, I can only assume, part of the build area was overlapping the OOB, (even though my items were not).
---
I had to abandon that spot.  But that was 100% cannot build, it never placed it after the initial build and log out.
---
That's a crappy bug, but it does say on the Fermenter that what you see is in the Stash.
---
They extended the boundaries of the no build zones
---
Just hit it there. It‚Äôs by the line of concrete pillars. 
---
I like this approach. Especially the last bit.
---
I did not do any of the above, and my camp did not have any placing issue. However, I got disconnected once while I was playing, and then kept getting booted when trying to relog, just like you. So just a heads up, it may not be Fermenter related. The issue resolved itself after a couple of hours and I could log back in normally. I did not attempt any fix except for restarting the game/launcher/laptop but none of it helped.

So then why not add legendary drops to the level 80 scorchbeasts if whitesprings has lost its reliability? At least for the level 80+ ones, sure the level 50-65 ones are pushing it I get that, but I feel having some sort boss type enemy to get a legendary from would be nice without having to drop a nuke, especially since nuke zone legendaries are nerfed now. 
---
Well if this is true, i may have to actually start picking up .308 ammo again, and use that gun for once. i never could bring myself to use it before due to the shit damage, but now? that sounds beautiful
---
You can reach me too .. I have the same issue. 
---
Honestly, no. It‚Äôs one quest that takes about an hour to complete. 
---
XB1 here, and yes I am!
---
i just exit the stat view and re-enter and it works.
---
I did not do any of the above steps, and my camp did not have any placing issue. However, I got disconnected once while I was playing, and then kept getting booted when trying to relog, just like you. So just a heads up, it may not be Fermenter related. The issue resolved itself after a couple of hours and I could log back in normally. I did not attempt any fix except for restarting the game/launcher/laptop but none of it helped.
---
Yes please, if the jukebox played Appalachia Radio I wouldn't care as much.
---
From the patch notes:  
---
C.A.M.P. Placement Adjustments: Occasionally, new game content may need to occupy a space in the world that was previously usable as a C.A.M.P. location. When this occurs, a new no-build zone will be placed in that spot, preventing players from building there in the future.
---
* If a player‚Äôs pre-existing C.A.M.P. location would overlap a new no-build zone on joining a world, a notification will now inform them that their C.A.M.P. cannot be placed, and they will be given one free C.A.M.P. placement.
---
The top of a precariously made windmill north west of Grafton!
---
This.  It depends on why you left the game.
---
you must have a thing for fat bottomed girls...
---
How did you come back and kill him? You can‚Äôt seek revenge after being killed with a wanted level I thought.
---
I agree, the green gets annoying. I would love a white light option
---
When I was a level 20 something, I came across a much higher level player by random. We got into a fight with a Scorch Queen and I tried to help in the fight anyway I could (from a distance). After he finally killed it, he left me a bag full of all kinds of goodies, though it took him a while to get me to understand to look down and see it.
---
That helped me so much and I was so grateful. I wish I could have verbally thanked him. Just a great gesture.
---
Wait, did they? What did they change?
---
can confirm syringers from 3\*
---
@Lady, you guys told me to update my graphics driver.... So I am just to show you this isnt the issue so a real fix can begin. I guarantee you that's not the issue as I have the same problem with this ONE character on all of my computers. This isnt a user side issue as the support ticket reply assumes. 
---
Interesting... may be a different bug? This issue has been ongoing for me at least 12 hours now (happened last night). I was also able to reproduce it "on demand" and broke my secondary character.
---
LOL, I am forever turning off radios everywhere I go.  Damn near every radio in the wasteland was left turned on.  Tactically, I want them off so I can here enemies.  I had jukebox in a camp once and I didn't figure out how to make it play something other than stuff I didn't like.  Now I just put up a wind chime and enjoy the sounds of it, the missle turret and wind turbines.
---
You ferment it longer to make it vintage which enhances the buffs 
---
Yes, the game was not in a great state at launch, but the potential should have been obvious to anyone. The hate and vitriol were just a MEME, which should be obvious too.  People acting like the severe hate and trolling were/are necessary to get Bethesda to listen are just trying to make themselves not look like so much of an jerk (and please don't forget how much of that negativity was directed at other players/redditors). Negative feedback is one thing, pure boiling rage and hatred are another.
---
However, things have been headed in a positive direction the whole time (regardless of what some would have you believe), and I am very glad that Bethesda is adding new content.
---
That's what I just said. I wish I didn't have to edit or store everything. I constantly build with friends I trust and want to be able to do that too even on my CAMP... That's why I said they should add it so we can switch something to "Trust" or whatever so they can edit and store as well. 
---
If someone left "Day One", after only playing for a day, this game just might not be for them. And thats ok. There are plenty other games out there. And plenty people playing 76. But imo, if anyone actually gives this game a chance, they will like it. 
---
Friends camp was near death claw island, said his camp was in no build.  He moved a little south along the river and rebuilt.
---
:) i know it's part of the game the way it is -  essential for leveling and advancing int he game. But it weirds me out.. when you guys talk about sever hopping like it's basic mundane game mechanic :D 
---
The protectron who always wanted to be Gutsy finally got his wish.
---
Yeah they did
---
Look at the road map... It has dates there for when everything gets released, it's not coming out all at once! 
---
If the game devs wanted us to have friends or family that held our gear for us while we went out into the wasteland, that's how they would have designed it. I actually RP too. Mules isn't something an RPer would tend to use, because it's specially about cheating the system but doing so in a subtle and almost justifiable way. These people have double, triple, quadruple the stash space as people playing the game as it was intended to be played.
---
Read the [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) for the dates of released content.
---
hahah! i have chased many a new player screaming into my mic "TAKE MY STUFFF!!!!"
---
&gt;  it's a quest chain and some drinks. 
---
Sounds good to me!
---
Hic.
---
You got that plan? Was it the red Ant Lager quest? Or the next one?
---
Yeah, I guess I was just hoping a little TOO hard.  Explains the 20gb update...
---
Did you take no damage at all with Assasins sentinel in this encounter? Or did you have to heal with stimpacks?
---
Hmmm if this happens again can you DM me?
---
ok thanks for sharing. i have the same problem that one of my characters cant login and i think in my case it either camp placement or fermenter related so i was just curious. and since you can login again i tried that too but without any luck, my character is still not able to login. 
---
Tried all basic stuff like router restart/repair game/... 
---
Next to highwire over a gully in Southern divide. Hadn't been there so that was nice view. 
---
repair bacon with eggs??
---
currently no. Armor pen from any source doesn't affect any energy weapons right now.
---
I drop all my known plans/recipes outside vault 76 so new players and alt characters get hooked up immediately right out of the womb. 
---
Can you shoot me a ticket number as well?
---
1 stars are piles of shit, I'd rather have the none legendary stuff to scrap
---
Here's to hoping you aren't on an 11 day cool-down before you can launch another nuke. It's a good thing there is a convenient way to check in-game if I am on cool-down that way I don't waste my time going through a silo /s.
---
You should crosspost this to r/falloutlore
---
Just before the DC I tried picking up a flower but pressing A was not picking it up. Then the controls froze and in a second or two, I was booted. A few failed tries later, I logged in once. Killed a few Mole Miners,rmthen tried to disarm a can chime but same thing again, followed by DC. This continued the loop of failed logins. After two hours, I tried logging in and it works now.
---
Ticket #190314-002173
---
I guess because one doesn't equal the other. I agree boss enemies would be great but I feel they should exist in "dungeons" you have to fight through. SBs aren't worth 3* and 1* doesn't seem to even be desirable to most people so that would be pointless. And still, I could lap the map at spawn points and cheese farm them. For me it's not one or the other, neither is great and we need a better method/challenge to get legendary items. 
---
Sure.
---
It was more laziness on my part because the daily wanted you to capture workshops but I didn't want to go around the map and the western workshops are a lot less annoying to claim. I was also hitting a few event spawn points here and there so you have to server hop to reset those. Agreed that server hopping is weird.
---
mods. disable them.
---
I misread the date. I appreciate you stating what was already said, though!
---
I agree. That doesn't change the fact that it is the only distinctly Mothman effigy done in the Interloper style that I've come across in a church. 
---
Naw.
---
Your confusion is now forgiven.
---
Much like a moped, a fatsnatch is fun to ride until your friends see you.
---
I woke up in front of a giant cliff with a tightrope to the other side. Yes, I did walk across it. Got a sweet pic half way through too!
---
I don't play to be annoyed though. When I hear that goddamned screech I server hop ASAP.   
---
Such an irritating, unrewarding enemy.
---
Oh my he looks possessed. 
---
You have to be a member of the fraternity to enter their clubhouse...
---
Hi friend, are you still open for business? I was looking for a twisted muscles serum for a melee build. PSN is AndyMatches. Thank you!

---
 &gt; Oh my he looks possessed.
---
There are multiple bugs that have been fixed that were just brought back with this patch.  It literally happens every single patch.
---
A flat boulder that had a living room set up on it in the open air under one of the giant metal towers, just north east of camp mcclintock
---
I had this happen to me yesterday I logged in and got the message and lost my whole camp and only a quarter of my base got saved so I had spend an hour getting materials to rebuild. I rebuild my base and the game crashed relogged in and spent another hour finalizing my base (camp was still there), had my camp almost finished then the server crashed. Relogged in and the message came and lost it again. 
---
If that happens, *and then you take the fermeting alcohol out of your stash*
---
I was not aware of this when i posted the previous comment, but its also not that bad? It seems like something that's not particularly likely to happen in normal play, to me at least.
---
At the very least they should remover or temp ban the player from being able to report again for some time 
---
I personally use a TSE Gatling Laser and a Furious Explosive Gatling Plasma and I have no problem with armor penetration. But I can where the downfall is with the rifles, all the usual rifle perks perks should apply. 
---
I mean if the Vault has a name it probably means it was meant to be added in the game eventually, perhaps not with this patch. 
---
You're neven going to take a workshop then? 
---
Happens to me all the time
---
I can see some people being really upset by this but let's face it, all those people would be equally if not more upset if they just had their camps destroyed when the updates came out.
---
Yep.  It's a weird back-and-forth unmarked quest with a trail of keys.  I shouldn't be shocked someone did it all by accident without realizing it.
---
‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt launched a nuke in over a week‚Äù is a great sentence.
---
Does your character break if you don't server hop? I'm not a server hopper myself and I have yet to use the fermenter.
---
I woke up in the river by Harpers Ferry bobbing in the stream...Definitely brings back memories of getting smashed and waking up in front of random people's houses.
---
Best MMO I've played since Diablo 2 and I've had those .08 diablo memories rush back in from long ago. I concur Bethesda has done a heck of a job!
---
Patience is one thing. doing a vendor run with Grape Mentats on a ten minute timer is something else entirely, especially when there's a line up at a vendor.
---
I‚Äôm not the one commenting in the subreddit of a game I dislike. Am I right?
---
How do you know they weren't legendary... maybe you just don't know the legend of the wooden spoons.
---
I think the Heavy Weapons still need another pass especially the Harpoon gun. It takes 2 shots to kill even normal Scorch. Meaning its completely unviable without Double, Quad, 2-Shot, or Explosive Legendary effects.
---
I noticed something similar, but in addition when I stopped playing my Food and Water levels were critically low and my Needing to go to the Toilet bar was maxed out.  
---
Think this update might need another Q.A. pass, to be honest :)
---
Bad thing is, it took two visits for me to figure it out, I'm clearly slipping :/
---
This type of anger pleases me. ‚ÄúOmg its not an emote its an emoji, duh rofl lmao insert more millenial slang here.‚Äù
---
Scorchbeasts are brilliant in that aspect, sometimes though (especially the fuckers in the Bog) they will single you out whilst you‚Äôre in a big fight. Outside of high level areas they seem fairly less aggressive
---
Clearly Bethesda fault. 
---
I found it in the random encounter location north of New Gad, for those who aren't on PC and/or don't make it in time to join egabor.
---
While the game has definitely less story to play compared to previous Fallout games, the lore is definitely still there, and it doesn't break much like people keep saying. 
---
Cannot find Nukashine:  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b104yn/problem_with_the_new_quest/
---
Cannot drop Items:  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b10h2z/cannot_drop_items/
---
Both seem to be related to an incompatible inventory management mod.
---
Theoretically it's not so much about the hopping as any time you join a server and your camp can't be placed you're at risk of it happening... if you server hop a lot the risk is higher. But it could happen just normally if you join and your C.A.M.P. set up. The two things that right now seem to trigger the problem are:  
---
\- Removing the items from your stash when your C.A.M.P. isn't placed  
---
\- The items finishing fermentation in your stash while your C.A.M.P. isn't placed
---
Exiting build mode and re-entering build mode fixes this problem temporarily for me. It's happening with other objects as well.
---
I can as well but I feel like what they drop just isn‚Äôt worth the bullets, besides I think that if they dropped even 50-75 caps I wouldn‚Äôt mind having to spend ammo.
---
This is 100% playstyle with one of my characters. It's super fun.
---
That‚Äôs what L3 does for me. Maybe you (or I) changed the button layout? 
---
No expects literally 0 bugs. But anyone with a lick of sense expects literally 0 **GAMEBREAKING** bugs. You see the difference right?
---
I spared your life and left you to a lifetime of misery. I'm sorry Harold.
---
Death has no consequences in adventure and no one engages in pvp in adventure mode. I would like the stakes to be higher. When I hear gunfire in the distance I want to be nervous. I don't think I'm the only casual player who wants to play survival but is not interested in constant pvp. 
---
So, to go back to the original point, shooting people unprovoked should incur a bounty. It will incur a bounty, because survival has more consequences. 
---
I'm on XBox, but I've noticed worse performance since yesterday's patch too.  Not at my CAMP, but out in the world.  Stuttering, mini-freezes for a half second, etc.
---
Nicht dein Anbieter ist schuld. Ich denke ein Fehler mittlerweile. manchmal bekomme ich ein Anschlussfehler "network validation error." Launcher kann nicht automatisch den login machen. Ein Fahler in Fallout76.exe. Das ganze passiert bei mir n√§mlich nur wenn ich die .exe benutze. Starte ich erst Bethesda launcher und starte aus dem launcher raus.passiert der fehler nicht mehr. 
---
We need more roofs as well
---
i have a wierd case with camp placement too.
---
one of my friends has a camp thats pretty close to mine, just outside of the circle radius.
---
whenever i join a server first both camps get placed, but when my friend joins first my camp doesnt get placed.
---
do you know, does it matter where you move the "CAMP machine"inside of your circle after you placed your camp on the map?
---
Level 80s have a chance to drop rare plans.  That being said it‚Äôs pretty damn uncommon.  I‚Äôve killed dozens and probably had one or two rare plans drop.
---
While the Ammo Economy should be a easy fix, these people took 5-6 months to fix the Assaultron Head eating all your ammo. 
---
I had this happen to me yesterday I logged in and got the message and lost my whole camp and only a quarter of my base got saved so I had spend an hour getting materials to rebuild. I rebuild my base and the game crashed relogged in and spent another hour finalizing my base (camp was still there), had my camp almost finished then the server crashed. Relogged in and the message came and lost it again. I've seen a few people having the same problem pretty sure it's a bug. 
---
Let‚Äôs be honest, the lighting in Fallout 76 sucks, the first area is way too sunny, and the nights in the northern area just look terrible and for some reason too bright.
---
heheheh i giggled
---
&gt; ‚Äú Fat Snatch,‚Äù
---
Scares me more than SheepSquatch
---
Upvote for awareness... it used to do this then at some point the blueprint capacity was greatly diminished. Can't hardly store anything in there now.
---
yeah im not sure what is up with that, its very disappointing, i even once removed all decorative items and just tried blueprinting my base structure to be able to move it someday, but the blueprint doesnt even allow 1/2 of it to be added
---
is this a bug?
---
I'm sticking what I consider to be good legendary items in suitcases at train stations, and I try to show people that they're there if I see them at the train station, I can't sell them off fast enough due to vendor caps and my character needs to lose weight.
---
I'm trying to hold on to a few 2-3\*'s with different good legendary effects for the legendary vendor (I have no clue how they will work ((I'd like to know)) but people say they are holding on to some of those.)
---
I also do not want to deal with a mule or player trading.
---
Ya, I hated that about my Jukebox.  Now I have the Classic and Appalachia radios, and scrapped that Jukebox.  I just select which one I want to listen to when I'm at my camp.
---
You're not dumb.  A dumb person would not ask questions and would choose to remain ignorant. 
---
GOD I hope the Alpine horn goes "bbbwwwwaaaaahhhhhhhhh" when you activate it.
---
The were no stars on it.. I rly want a legendary spoon to tap on ghouls. 
---
And I think Mothman should give you some badass loot if you kill him. I was totally underwhelmed after seeing only my 3rd Mothman in 200 hours and being able to kill him. It felt like a huge achievement for me (a mutt-build level 40-something at the time). But the loot sucked.
---
Wait, you can hop to do dailies multiple time?
---
this is a good idea. Still a little risky - I want to be absolutely sure somebody gets them. Some of the plans are pretty rare
---
I leave all my extras in the Overseer's camp cache.
---
I'd be interested to see the concurrent and peak player numbers for Fallout 76 compared to last month, and the month before.
---
I imagine that has a great deal to do with it.
---
Question EVERYTHING hahaha
---
You want a toe, Dude? I can get you a toe. He'll, I can get you one that talks!
---
Exactly.
---
I got stuck in a glitch surrounded by enemies that were at range (I was on my melee).
---
I couldn't move, I couldn't fast travel. Decided to drink a vintage nuka shine and I was out of there just 1 minute later 
---
The lever-action is what I'm getting it on also.
---
Interesting. How do you get the quests exactly? Do they just show up in your pipboy or do you have to travel near the npc starting the quest?  I have 5-6 quests I like to do. Every time  I log in they show up in my pipboy as completed and travelling near the npc usually does nothing. Does that mean that I might have to do other daily quests first before my favorite ones can reset?
---
It's a fun time.

A few areas are a bit off. But as a whole it has some good lighting.
---
It is really weird how much Bethesa is against double action revolvers.
---
I kill them in a few seconds, server hopping takes a lot longer. You should look into how to defeat them quickly, it'll save time in the long run! 
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be all of them but a few legendary sb based on RNG is absolutely needed. Right now I just avoid SB unless I‚Äôm in a bad mood. Ghouls are the real deal when it comes to loot drops. The ammo and time wasted on sb and the pathetic reward is just not worth it. 
---
Wasn't implying that it uses more ammo, but it does in fact increase the recoil on the LMG.
---
Yeah it drives me crazy, i really liek how the jukebox looks in my CAMP, but even though i turn it off each time, every time i return to my camp, the jukebox is turned back on.
---
the radios seem to remember how i had them set,
---
maybe just please make it so the jukebox is by default "off"??
---
maybe @Ladydevann or @BethesdaGameStudios_ or @Valseek could look into this?
---
I had a small and pretty basic camp and I was able to go nuts in comparison to what I had before. Well... it certainly feels like I have more freedom in my opinion :)
---
I got it for the daily, today that was brewing Ballistic Bock. You obviously get that recipe, I got 1 Red Ant Lager too and that plan. Assuming the plan is random or semi random from a new plan list. Don't think I can do another until tomorrow
---
Welp, that's a massive disappointment.
---
yeah I should have done that but since no one was around I just went on my way...
---
Depends on if a bunch of non-damage dealers are going to be in the area buffing the Queen and not pulling their weight. Unless they toned it down recently. 
---
 Psn Deathgod905 
---
Kill it with fire, holy water, silver knives, just do it!

I'd give my right testicle for that secret door.

---
Nyss. 
---
Oh lovely! üòë. The spot I chose doesn‚Äôt really fit my camp blueprint from my previous spot. So I ended up scrapping it all and will start over this weekend. Hoping to make a new and better camp. It‚Äôs really annoying but oh well. Hopefully for the better. 
---
Any news on paladin?
---
Careful admitting to killing someone, regardless of the justification, the carebears on this sub think anyone who pvp's is an asshole.
---
Hey kids, you love GTA online right? We're just as whacky! Come play our game about 1960's people blowing up cars with really big guns! We're also funny! 
---
It's your custom .ini or mods.
---
Last night Biv gave me the quest for red Ant Lager. Couldn't get any more from him after. I'll try again tonight. 
---
Bethesda has long term never been a disappointment. Are their CS services shit? Yes! Can they be stupid and do things to keep their parent a float with it's other shit companies? Yes! Do Todd and squad always have our best in mind and really want to push through restrictions to make us some good rpg's they love as much as we do? Y E S!
---
&gt; ONLY after sorting to Chems

There's an issue with Better Inventory. Dev says to [disable it until the update is available](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showtopic=7151926/#entry68468251). 
---
I believe lonevaultwanderer said he passed this issue onto the development team. This was a thing in Fallout 4 as well. 
---
With that being said it‚Äôs hard to tell if this was by design. I sure it hope it wasn‚Äôt by design. Since it makes an already underpowered Energy Rifle completely fall flat as compared to a ballistic counterpart. 
---
and spotlights ;)
---
Yes, but this would be open to exploitation. 75 caps per SB would turn them into cap farms. Less scrupulous players would just do that and max out their caps super fast. You have to consider how other players might cheese a mechanic rather than assuming everyone would play as fairly as you do :) 
---
Sounds like the same angry mouth breather who reported the NYC guy yesterday. 
---
Uninstall/Deactive mods if you have any installed. they seem to cause this issue atm
---
Just like in New Vegas 
---
I rented it from Redbox a month ago, enjoyed it so much I bought the next deal I saw.  I would say not worth sixty but maybe $35-$40.  I have like 250 hours atm.
---
Also sorry for fizziness, didnt realize it was recording my mic xD
---
Now they just need to make .308 ammo a little more realistic to obtain. 
---
I think this is at least part of the issue. Seems when there is a "diseased" or other legendary with a long enough name that it truncates part of it, the guard mobs can spawn with a false tag.
---
I've seen it twice with ghouls, but I also found a diseased glowing bloodbug that had 4 "legendary" bug guards. None of the bugs listed as legendary dropped anything unusual, but the diseased bug dropped a legendary item.
---
Hey actually just bought it, nice to see alot of people having fun with it tho :)
---
You know, honestly, that guy's dead.. soooooooo ... \*YOINK\*  I have a new Nuka Cola lamp!!  Best in Appalachia!!
---
Can confirm I used to place Vega tables in my stash and they would stop spoiling now they spoil I put maybe 30 razor and 16 corn in today and they spoiled in 5 minutes but I still have items like corn and carrots that I had in there pre patch that are still good also had a stack of cooked glowing meat maybe 16 of them that spoiled at the same time. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a glitch with the new spoil timers they added.
---
Most people just have friends lol
---
Every time I log in I get a daily depending on where I am. E.g. if I'm close to Camden yards I get one of those. When I fast travel to Grafton I get one of those.
---
Pretty sure it's just RNG. Personally I haven't been getting the vocodor syringer daily, maybe I'll try fast travelling there and then serving hopping and see if I can get it that way.
---
Same, glad the radio is back, but I want to keep the Jukebox even if I don't have it on.
---
It's iron Man

In your conjecture, you say that we don't know where FEV comes from. However, FEV is known to be developed by West-Tek during its Pan-Immunity Virion Project. 
---
There is some debate over the differences between laboratory FEV and post-war environmental FEV.   
---
Yes thank you Bethesda!!! 
---
Try building random things at that location and re-log. You will get the notification and free move again. If you only place the camp object it won't give you the error upon re-logging. I played with it this morning when I noticed something was wonky with this new no-build-zone implementation. Why they didn't just extend the red zone where you cannot place your camp is beyond me. Too bad it wasn't that easy.
---
Lead from the weights in the fire department and any tin can or toy you see.  Also I agree with the .50 Cal mod. You can make 100 .50 for only a little more than .308.  If you are using the hunting rifle on Xbox I can mod it up for you.
---
So doing the math, I decided to do a comparison of the auto heavy weapons buffs (ballistic vs. energy), assuming that Stabilized provides no benefits for energy since it only changes the DR.  SBQ has 300DR/300ER (165DR after Stabilized).  All weapons max level.

**Conclusion** \- The Minigun should be a beast now after the patch, but you'll burn 5mm ammo at twice the rate of 50 cal ammo.  The Gatling Laser makes up a lot of lost ground, but is hurt by Stabilized not providing any benefits for ER penetration.  And it has reloading ammo issues.
---
Note - I've played less with the Minigun and Gatling Laser, so I haven't included damage modifying mods in the analysis.

**Conclusion** \- Gatling Gun (using an estimated fire rate since the tool tip is obviously way wrong with it) has less sustained damage than even the Gatling Laser but is very ammo efficient.  Its still respectable damage, and once modified with a speedy receiver, that goes up further.  However I'm skeptical of that estimated fire rate, given my own experience, the 50 cal should easily have more sustained damage.
---
The LMG though should be an absolute DPS monster now, outclassing every other auto heavy weapon out there.  Only limited by its 75 round drum so you'll be reloading more often and the ammo isn't as easy to come by.
---
yeah unfortunately it happened to me lat night after the patch as well
---
also, the legendary robots in Watoga explode as soon as they die now...
---
The Fire rate decrease is painful when using a charging barrel for the gatling lasers.
---
I shoot slower than a normal gatling gun on top of having technically lost DPS as the 33% fire rate does not make up for the damage increase in actual gameplay (atleast with the charging barrel). 
---
My time to kill has increased exponentially for most mobs. With some requiring upwards of 2-3 more shots to kill. And that's with a TSE gatling laser. 
---
The slower rate of fire means it doesn't completely nuke your ammo stash. 
---
I've just converted mine to ultracite because you craft 308 ultracite ammo 81 at a time with ammosmith and it takes florescent Flux which is all around Whitesprings. 
---
There's currently a bug where the small pew plan gives you a church bench for your camp rather than a special laser rifle. They should fix it.
---
This was not broken by the new patch because it has never been a feature. I hope they fix it, but I have never had occasion to use it in vendor trading, though it would be useful in player trading.
---
About the drop - the only thing I can think of is the raw fertilizer coolers where you get a similar message ‚Äòyou sure you want to steal this‚Äô and no bounty. Or knocking down a cargo bot. Same message. No bounty. 
---
I‚Äôm not defending asshole behavior, but the first cargo theft bounty I got was for the same reasons.

A while back I was watching a presentation on recycling and saw aluminum cans and got very excited.

I want to introduce Biv to Drinking Buddy from Fallout 4. They're a match made in drunk heaven.

/u/Heartwork420's (Carcass rules, btw) latest [Atom Shop datamine](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ng59/datamined_new_atomic_shop_items_1303_patch_1108/) has the [Vault-Tec Scientist outfit](https://i.imgur.com/ro4DaoO.png), which is a clean lab coat, so there's one down :)  
---
I'm with you on a lot of the others. Of course, I also want the scrappiest of scraps for more wasteland-y characters, so...just more CAMP stuff, basically.
---
Some people have DeLoreans, we have Fallout 76.
---
Now why cant they do this to the suspended players? That would be the easiest solution, then they could come back and even spend money in the atom shop.
---
Sugar, water, purple.
---
I suggested this after i first started playing, i was really disappointed there is hardly any difference at night from day regarding visibility
---
apparently then they told me so many people complained it was too dark at night so they nerfed darkness....
---
hopefully if this gets more traction they might revisit that decison
---
I know my CAMP whould never place if I had logged out while in my CAMP...and the game whould spawn me in within the footprint of where my main building whould be.
---
I'd like it a little bit darker. Right now it feels like early evening to me. I'm expecting it to get darker and then the sun comes up lol. It is what it is with that one, can't please everyone with whatever they go with. Maybe a graphical slider each player could adjust just like depth of field and FOV? 
---
Why?
---
As a fellow sneaky bastard. Is muffled better than ultra light build? Sneak is the build I feel best at, but I don't know what to do?
---
I haven't had and high RoF TS weapons and I haven't seen anywhere that it increased recoil. If it increases recoil on one gun, it does it for all of them and that hasn't been my experience.
---
I was kidding... 
---
How did you guys keep your caffeine levels from zeroing out? I lose all ap when mine reach critical level. 
---
The Sanguine quest is what I thought of, too. Good times.
---
Such as. I assumed those were just regular daily/weekly quests
---
The night is dark and full of terrors
---
It's new.  I like it :D
---
So originally anyone could flip the switch but now, you put the 4 digit code in and it sends power for like a second

Haven Church is haunted and music plays at night.  Read the notes scattered around.  The raiders talk about the music.  
---
I mean 1 of every kind!
---
Doesn't ESO charge for all its expansions though? I don't play it but I swear I saw an ad recently for an upcoming expansion and it was like $40 or $60. You can't really expect the same level of content from a free update vs one that's the same price as a full game.
---
Hey dude!
---
I was out wrecking camps and forcing PvP the other day and came across your awesome build. 
---
I was so impressed that we just talked  and jumped around for a while then we had some light pvp and my gang beat up your friends. Im sure you remember.
---
Very impressive stuff! Best bar ive seen yet. Building into things is a fine art!
---
Good seeing ya again

Launched on prime yesterday and noticed the ferns were a lot brighter than before. Made looting them much easier!
---
How long? I left bourbon and beer in there for an hour
---
Why not?
---
so you were LYING lol
---
This paint is from Atom Shop
---
Well at least we know the dev team was notified... I really wan to use energy weapons, but even with the buff I worry they will feel so much weaker due to not being able to ignore armor like the ballistic counter parts
---
I haven't looked up the new recipes but I'm sure if you actually search the reddit you'll find them... 
---
No, I'm fairly sure it doesn't. It doesn't increase the recoil on any of my 3 TS weapons so unless the LMG is bugged it shouldn't be.
---
You know, you're right. I had previously stored a larger compete C.A.M.P but now I can only store part of the structure. Seems like a significant bug.
---
Besides using random chairs &amp; benches in the world, I also like to squat in station toilets w/the door closed when AFK. Haven't been caught yet with my pants down...

on ps4 last night, every legendary protectron blew up instantly

Junk from player kills.
---
Nice!
---
Because Bethesda
---
Agree.  I have my color calibration FAVORING a darker look because I play a lot of RPG games and I like my torches to actually matter.  FO76 nights are still super bright though, lol.
---
every legendary i killed blew up instantly on ps4
---
The ROF changes shouldn't be anything but a buff for your damage output. Each individual round doing more damage means more armor is bypassed. 
---
Murder them and fill their loot bag with plans. A little reverse banditry never hurt anyone :)
---
This is "exactly" the type of bug a QA tester is hired to look for, considering its triggered by simply using the new workbench aka content as we are told!  Craft a bench, put your crap in it, and play the game.   
---
They have the system to allow you to play without your camp placed, so the testers should know to check for conflicts regarding the new items they are adding and camp usage/pacement and all other combinations of situations regarding the system. Part of testing new implemented systems requires setting up as many scenarios as possible, and It's not like what triggers this is a very unique situation at all.
---
Why not what?
---
The point is it's artificial, because the same character would have a burden under 1,500 with correct perks.  
---
The problem is not the weight but the number of unique items.
---
That is freaking fantastic!! Thanks for bringing it to my attention
---
Thanks for the answer. I'll do a little server hopping at the Southern Belle Motel and see if that bomb defusing robot will speak to me eventually
---
Your build area is a big cylinder. Find roughly what the horizontal radius is, and build your second camp that distance away from the border. 
---
They won't be that close together, but you'll still be close enough to see each other depending on terrain.
---
Thanks.... now if I can just finish that novel I've been working on for the last 5 years. :)
---
I'm almost 90% certain it does.
---
I know for a fact that using a two-shot cryolator -with- the crystallizing barrel it does considerably. But I think that's partly because the crystallizing barrel adds recoil by itself. 
---
I too woke up in the monorail car.. didn‚Äôt even know this particular car was accessible until I realized it wasn‚Äôt the crazy scientists car. I got one hell of a surprise when I stepped out as a Behemoth was waiting for me..

The haters have moved on to other games. I hear some AAA game is crashing xbox or something? I am sure that subreddit is full of negative karmafamas
---
Been playing since day one of beta still love the game after 700+ hours. 
---
Mods can increase recoil, but TS doesn't.
---
Closer to 20,000 X 9 = 180,000 for me presently, but that point is not my personal "stash" as I am largely unaffected, as had been mentioned a few times, just the "mules" that were for donations.   
---
The point is the people who didn't have the addiction and time to make the dedicated leveled Alts 
---
They would be too easy to farm.
---
SB are really easy to deals with once you get a correct build 
---
Am college student, can confirm. 
---
Pacifist mode means YOU are a pacifist and won't attack another player. It doesn't make every other player instantly a pacifist as well. Even so what's the point of playing if there is no sense of danger? You're better off playing Minecraft on creative mode at this point.

Here's to hoping i run into a crew like yours, sounds like fun. Spent the first 50 hours of the game roleplaying as an italian chef with a chef hat, ski outfit and a rolling pin. I would set up camp just outside the overseers camp and serve carnberry cobblers and radstag meat to noobies, good times.
---
I added 30 new muttfruits! hooray!
---
Lol I shouldn't post while working

man i miss raider armor from fallout 3+NV, that stuff was the stuff of badass wet dreams. dont get me started on the pit.

Exactly on point, they had to do 25% more than ballistic to effectively be "equal"

Alright alright very true! Lol

What does that mean?

I do events, craft ammo, make food, craft ammo , help friends with missions, craft ammo, craft food , craft ammo, do more events, craft ammo, go scorched beast hunting, yep , craft ammo.

Weirdly enough a shitload of folks are getting Knight paint right after the update... me included and yes I'll paint on PS4.  HOWEVER, BEWARE:  I had a ton of technical data on me and when I "inserted technical data" during Forbidden Knowledge, it took all of them out of my inventory.  Previously I had been able to cycle through them by dropping/retreiving them in the metal box in the same room amd doing them one by obe.
---
I‚Äôd give you more upvotes if I could sir
---
Yes! This will be even worse when we can decorate with items from our stash. I can't imagine having to place everything all over again.
---
Gotta love the default responses. I have no sound on my laptop but they won't help me because the GPU in the laptop is slightly below min spec &lt;eyroll&gt;.

In a small u marked abandoned shack along the cliffs of the divide, getting staggered by a glowing radstag, I found it very fitting

well, they are back, and we can craft them, but where the hell are they?  checked all vendors, no plans.

\*tips fedora
---
After reading the comments I was thinking the same thing. Instead of all of them maybe just the level 80+ SB‚Äôs should have legendary drop rates 
---
Not sure. Just know that's the case. I filled my fermenter last night before logging off haven't checked them yet
---
So in bed how much time do we get?
---
So thats what happend last night! Killed one and it exploded instantly. And took a few cars with it ...
---
wasnt that fallout 3
---
Feed the people aside, the markers were actual objectives i.e. buttons to press 
---
That is awesome, please let me know if you get any other paints like Elder or Paladin! 
---
I want this lamp so bad! Both in game and reality! Such an awesome lamp! 
---
That would be stupid. These are so common enemies, you would be farming these all day. 
---
I thought it was going to be just a small % of budget made with the fix, but man coming home to 50% budget free, i have about 30% that i really don't need now lol.

Pics or it didn't happen.

On the new nukashine quest, I found a lunch bag full of chess pieces next to a chessboard. Nothing happened after I collected them and sat at the chessboard but I feel like it should have started a game. I even had a friend with me sit across. I'm keeping the chess pieces just in case.
---
Leaked event from wild Appalachia? 
---
I woke up to two skeletons sitting on toilets sharing wine and mentats with a 10mm on the ground. 
---
That's where I spawned after my first round with Nukashine. Funny coincidence was, that's my camp. It was quite the experience.
---
I really wish Wind Turbines produced maybe 20 or 25 units of power rather than 12.  They look cool, but I wouldn't want to have more than one if I could help it... and given that a Water Purifier consumes 8... well...
---
Ah, thanks. I think when I get my friend on I'll test with him to get a definitive answer.
---
I'd say for better or worse your team is probably one of the most thick-skinned community managers in the business, fallout fans can be absolutely vile sometimes. Don't take that stuff to heart, a large majority of us really appreciate what you do and it does make a difference! It's not easy to stay positive when you have to read negative comments all day but you're handling it brilliantly.
---
That‚Äôs my next goal. I mine tech data multiple times a day, so I will let you know if I find it. 
---
I was thinking of this last night.  If one of the the guys in power armor who took the group photo happens to see this post I'd love to see the pic.  It hadn't even brought up photo mode yet at the time otherwise I'd have snapped a pic myself.
---
Good read!
---
I like when the three star robots drop a drill and then explode in your face while you're trying to figure out where the legendary item is.
---
Did they say they would do this, or are you just making up expectations?
---
Already got Initiate and knight paint, thank you tho! I‚Äôm just curious to see if they put in the others since there was no news about it
---
Ah, I see. I suppose that makes more sense. 
---
It's next week
---
It's been an issue since the beta and reported for more than 2 months now.  
---
The engine currently doesn't have a mechanic for ER reduction in the same way a DR reduction is hard coded in.
---
put a spoiler tag in this
---
Stopped for food on way home so didn't have to cook, stacked up drinks on desk before starting.  Started regular dosages and things took off from there!
---
Thanks a lot for the vendor "Actual Garbage". 
---
Yeah no problem! I was so surprised to find it works if
---
I have a strange issue with this quest, I left all of my technical data in my stash before unlocking the Forbidden Knowledge quest, and I periodically get a technical data when switching servers. It just puts one in my inventory automatically when I spawn and tells me to turn it in. At first I thought it was coming from my stash, but I still have the exact same amount in storage even though I have turned in like 100 of them.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what sucks. I just added you so if you wanna do one let me know
---
Nukashine beats caps payed at fast travel only downside it would be a random fast travel lol 
---
Yea 50 and 65 can be Legendaries too, just mix them up with RNG like all other creatures. Occasionally I‚Äôve got a few surprises from SB in the past, such as prime receiver plans, from different level SBs including 50 and 65. 
---
They used to be, and then they changed it to just 76. Not sure why.
---
Yup... you can never wrong with single malt that's old enough to drink itself.
---
I didn't have much time to play last night but I saw you could make plain beer, wine, and liquor. But can you learn to make the branded beers somehow? Like Pickaxe Pilsner? 
---
We are all a bunch of crack heads, aren't we...
---
No problem! :)
---
Shouldn't is the key word. Sadly my time to kill has increased, not solely due to fire rate. It is taking anywhere from 1-3 additional shots to kill most endgame mobs.
---
We have a radio volume slider in the options now! 
---
The bug I've noticed is that when the gun auto-reloads, it tends to auto-reload 2 bullets and nothing more until I manually reload it.  That's not new to Patch 7, though.
---
Not automatically, I don't know if they're available by finding recipe plans. 
---
You sound so cool. 
---
Does it also go in the body?
---
lol
---
Dropped a L62 *** ghoul, received a drill.
---
Exactly what happened to me yesterday. Blasted to near death and found a fancy drill. 
---
I bought 800 nuclear material two weeks ago and am now down to 200 trying to unlock those last few mods. Might as well be throwing screws into a fissue ;_;
---
I know right? 
---
Unfortunately this doesn't work because it is removed from your inventory and then interacted with. It's not like a "normal" piece of armor. I thought about this before as well and why it would and wouldn't work. It would be nice but it's put on your well, you use it, it is then removed from your inventory, thus removing from your wheel. You would have to "favorite" it every time you exited it and that sounds like a major chore. 
---
it's in fermentables

Once I stumbled upon a Sentry Gutsy just outside of Watoga. Sentry Bot body, Gusty weaponry and speech. I was quite confused. I wish I had taken a screenshot but instead I just shot it..

So was i 
---
After I thought about the blackout, that was one of my fears, WTF will be there when my character wakes up
---
I think you'd be hard pressed to convince me that it's any easier than the many random single Legendaries in Watoga...
---
passive aggressive much for no reason?  man i hate the internet sometimes

*sighs* yes, they have said they are will be adjusting no build zones.  last night many people said they couldnt place their CMAPS as they are in the new no-build zones

but there are still turret camps at whitesprings

So you are saying you like it?

I run with a gang who forces PvP constantly. 
---
Everyone is taking 2 weeks off until survival drops in fear of being reported
---
Only 3 of us are doing any PvP right now...
---
I was told i was reported last night twice by players who though my armor was "cheating". Another group thought i was bobblr heading because i killed them far away from their workshop...
---
I ended up explaining how i mitigated their damage with cavaliers...
---
*oh well we both reported you for cheating anyway.. Do you know where we can get some of that armor?*
---
Now they are on my friends list... Im working with my trader pal to hook them up with some sentinals...
---
Bad timing Bethesda.. You should have put the report fuction in AFTER survival mode!
---
So for the next 2 weeks my plan is to be super lame over the mic...  I started doing this last night...
---
" I am going to initiate PvP now. Do i have your consent?"
---
"You own the munitions factory, my teamate is going to claim it in 10 seconds, which will allow you and I to PvP. Prepare yourself!"
---
Then i have to console them for a few minutes and explain the game mechanics... *Smh*

Seems like the new update has brought back some of the old shit heads. I had a similar encounter yesterday.

No, 15 is the max

Scorchbeasts = more annoying Cliff Racers

Under which one though? Didnt see nukashine as an option in any of the menus. 
---
So weird, I only go AFK in train station bathrooms, crouched with the door shut. :)
---
And yes I love to swing around here to see the flat earthers equivalency in gaming when I think it wasn't real to see it once again and laugh my ass off.
---
There are clothing , and food buffs, you can get to boost them higher I should add, but this is the max for perks and such.
---
oh! I had a camp near the junk pile there and I used to get that quest all the time until I did it and then I never got it again.
---
Yeah maybe that is bugged?
---
I think they had to take them out early in the beta because people were placing a bunch and breaking servers. 
---
Cool cool !
---
Gives new meaning to the name ‚Äúfallout‚Äù
---
Actually being able to store the whole camp was the bug. Listed in one of the earlier patch notes. Granted now the blueprints are useless. 
---
I'll have to try it again tonight and see what the deal is. Maybe there's something inconsistent about how/why it happens.
---
Off the top of my head, I was using a gauntlet; maybe that doesn't count as killing it with a melee weapon for this purpose? 
---
omg lol
---
Tards gotta tard.
---
Wait... Are you saying we aren't supposed to eat those?
---
Not likely. If Beth didn't add NPC's to the beginning of the game, they likely won't add any in the future.

My pleasure.  And thank you for providing a platform from which those stories might flow.

The durability for laser rifles is still *way* too low. I can't speak on heavy weapons, but my laser rifle still breaks crazy fast compared to my combat/handmade rifles.
---
Dude i know... I liked a little bit of grass.
---
So you have the rare "problem" of an unlimited loot and caps source?  Dammit, I got a worse deal than I thought....
---
Do you know all the tricks? 
---
It's one of the most endorsed mods in fallout 4 and yes he made the same lighting tweaks and edits in fo76.
---
Go west. 
---
I‚Äôm lvl 112 and still haven‚Äôt killed one yet. I thought maybe I could get a couple yesterday after servers came up but it was later in the day and no dice. 
---
Need Saint Juib to come drive them out of Appalachia 
---
Its a bug if you have mods, I think
---
If you‚Äôre referring to the past 24 hours I have not gotten the chance.
---
But even if I get 1 it‚Äôs easier to do that repetitively then to kill a scorchbeast (IMO)
---
Oh oki doke. Guess I just didn‚Äôt see the notes.
---
Hopping worlds often Green thumb perk then pick 2x corn razograin from billings homestead and corn tato mutfruit from my camp make vegetable starch scrapped adhesive bulked to sell at vendors. Maybe loot whitespring golf clubhouse selling golf clothes too.
---
If Bethesda wanted to turn the Fallout series into something more "The Secret World"-esque with more supernatural elements and corporate conspiracies...I would be ok with that.
---
Stay in the Forest until you level up a bit.  You'll look back in like a week or so and wonder how you died so much. Just stick with it. 
---
It's in fermentables. It should be listed as fermentable nukashine
---
If you are paying real money for something that gives you any defensive bonuses-its pay to win, sorry, but that's a fact.
---
Doesn't change the fact that Bethesda obviously lied to you about lighting and rendering. You just believe that betheada actually made all new lighting and rendering when we both know it's the same.
---
Killed her last night with a buddy, easily our fastest kill on her. We finished with about 15 minutes to spare.
---
They didn't MAKE new lighting and rendering, they changed the lighting and rendering 
---
I use as many copies of Backwoodsman 3 as I can. Are there other tricks?

It affects recoil. I have a two shot 10mm smg and perfect storm. I prefer perfect storm because the recoil is way less on it. They have the same attachments too. 
---
Seems every single patch the textures for Atom Shop items get messed up for PC users using Mods.  The INI files you are deleting likely include the Custom INI file.
---
This patch is particularly bad as it did a big change to the inventory system, and it's not just textures that are messed up by the mods now, but the whole inventory system at times.
---
Ah, like I said I hadn't heard of any specific bug but that's interesting to know. 
---
It might be a terminal. I don‚Äôt remember. As far as music is concerned, have you been to Valley Galleria?
---
What did they do with moth man omelettes? I tried it a few times and the eggs wouldn't respawn.
---
After the first 30 days after the game release and reading reddit, you'd turn to a lot of alcohol too! :P
---
If I could just create a Scorchbeast swatter spell like in Morrowind...
---
But I'm melee prime so I just angrily look at them flying above til they land. 
---
Lol we do a chef bit. 
---
We walk up to a camp *while arguing about who is a better chef* usually in italian accents.
---
We try to get a player to taste our dishes and decide.
---
Then whoever he doesnt pick kills the other chef.  And asks for help hiding the eveidence. 
---
Later the cops show up asking about a missing chef...
---
Well they're working now and as far as I know I'm the only one who requested them be put back in which was read by a bethesda team member 
---
Yeah but that doesn't justify adding in legendary SBs, that only exacerbates an issue. 
---
Drop rates is 1 issue imo. I have 900h in the and not 1 awesome , godly call em whatever rolls . Best gun is a 2* IE gatling and best armor a sentinel ass robot arm lvl 30 . 900h and i 90 % if the time hit spots that should spawn 3* enemies
---
They had been there since beta, just got temp removed
---
I feel bad for the people reviewing the reports... I'm sure they get abused a lot. Hell, I'll admit in GTA I've abused it a few times when I'm feeling particularly grumpy (not that rockstar ever does anything with the reports anyways which is why I think I take it so lightly). 
---
I'm going to guess most of these companies will only bother looking into something if they get repeated reports of similar behavior from one person (that's how I'd do it cause I know people are going to be salty but if multiple people are complaining about the same thing then there usually is something there).
---
they see it as a legitimate way to farm legendaries. It's not wrong, but it is selfish. i havent destroyed any bases but i have just shut the door, lol. 
---
I feel everyone posts this same thing the day after a patch and then you never hear another word until the next patch. I'm wondering if there's something that happens during the patch that causes the food to spoil but not update the condition bar. Then when everyone logs in, all our food goes bad really fast. But then when we pick up new food, it goes back to the normal rate.
---
So much this, I have had little to no problems going back to even day 1, me thinks its because when I log in I stay on 1 server all night. The majority of the glitches I have encountered seem to happen while first joining the servers.
---
They weren't temp removed. There wasn't any intention of adding them back without people asking. It's the same with some other things
---
You raise a valid point. Only time will tell.
---
Didn't you hear? They added the ability to ride Scorch Beasts...but only when you're black out drunk.
---
Hang out in the first area for awhile.  Don't worry so much about following the questline.  Just explore the area and gain some levels.  As you get perks things become a lot easier.  Once you build up a little you can stop concentrating on survival and start building up your combat skills.  
---
15 is the max value for perks points for each stat. You can't have more perks selected for each stat than that.
---
Increases beyond the base 15 still affects things like damage increases, ap regen, crafting, etc..
---
Ya.  Last night I logged in with an extra 25% budget to work with.  And I only had ONE turrent.
---
Now I expanded and put 9 higher level turrets ontop of my house.  I feel so good.  No more gardens destroyed by molerats I hope.
---
The fertilizer one?
---
Unyielding gear is awesome for boosting special stats. Radicool will give +5 strength at 50% rads. 
---
my camp is right next to the flagpole at devil's backbone. i love my camp but secretly hope they made it non-buildable because i also like building camps, lol. 
---
If you are dumb enough not to research a expansion before you play it then you deserve disappointment 
---
scorchbeasts are nothing, but I do think the queen should be a guaranteed legendary
---
No.  It's a bug.  Doesn't seem to affect everyone though as people were launching Nukes on my server last night (PS4).
---
I thought it was a glitch. Ended up in a underground cave, I think I‚Äôm gonna drink some more.
---
Yea, it was odd to find they‚Äôd been removed after the beta. Made no sense
---
I just wish there was a way for the player base to be trusted with a ‚Äúking of the hill‚Äù style fight for control over the radio station. All those jukeboxes are just sitting around... it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre begging to be looted of their tracks for us to create and compile our own library of music to use and set in the rotation. 
---
But they don‚Äôt want abusive and obnoxious DJs... so how does one get around that while adding something that could be a lot of fun?
---
Honestly, I'd say the troll following and bugging you is definitely the type that is not abusive to use report on. If you are changing servers and they are following you, that's not playing the game, that is actively trying to harass some one.
---
I went to the supermarket and saw a display full of garden gnomes. Thought my luck was in, all that concrete lol.
---
I don‚Äôt farm them for plans. I farm them for meat. But I‚Äôm very simple, if I get a plan great, if not no biggie. I don‚Äôt bother with their bones just leave that crap and whatever loot they drop, I harvest the hell out of the organs though.
---
It might be. However I have the same problem with "play time" in Berkely Springs, "queen of the hunt" at the hunter's shack, "waste not" at the red rocket mega stop and "cop a squatter" in Watoga. Haven't tried the other quests in a while though. I'll try them and the server-hopping-solution this evening.
---
man people are being assholes to you Op for no reason
---
some people spent alot of time on bases, and really enjoy them
---
i feel for anyone who lost their homes
---
of course they can rebuild, but its never the same..
---
here's hoping your next house will be even better than your last one you lost!
---
Yes they definitely would have to work on the functionality of it as it would operate differently than other favorited items. But I have faith that our friends at Bethesda could figure it out.
---
I take it someone already looted the weights :-)
---
Sure he did pal. He single handedly changed he engine despite not having access to the engine code.
---
They really need to buff the Plasma rifle and raise the cost of the cartridge. Ideally it would be about 50-70 damage behind the guassrifle. A maxed short barrel version should have around 90 damage  and the sniper 165-180. A raised cost of copper or a massive decrease in ammo per build would balance out the higher damage and return the plasma rifle to the satisfying hard hitter as it was in fallout 4.
---
Looks like this is only once you insert the keycard - just found out the hard way at Charlie. About to confirm at Alpha if we can be bothered...
---
Way harder than other late, at least from the amount of ammo you need to take one down.
---
Even better, the cows don't always let you milk them. Sometimes they are surly and try to kick you instead.
---
Also, there isn't a way to add tracks on console at this time. It's like with GTAs custom radio station but it's only on PC due to accessibility of files
---
Pretty much. Few days ago I was at a vendor and some clown just comes in trying to kill me. I exit out of the trade screen and see he is doing jack all damage to me.  I shrug him off and and really wish there was an "F Off" emoji with a middle finger. So I move and crouched into sneak to have chameleon pop and sat there silent near the exit opposite the vendor. He just stood there looking like an idiot expecting me to do something and then he went away. I dont give these people the time of day to actually attack them back since thats what they want. 
---
I wouldn't mind it being possible for them to be legendary, but scorchbeasts are not especially hard to kill so I don't need to always just drop legendaries at their current difficulty. They already have a chance to drop some good stuff.
---
The higher star scorchbeasts would have legendary health regen and whatnot so be careful what you wish for if you consider them challenging already.
---
It would probably be more fun, but when they drop a drill or a one star nocturnal board you might not be super happy about it.
---
Im not saying every legendary should be an awesome 3* but a little better the odds could be. Maybe remove some like medics , who needs that ? I have seen 0 enemies that deal that much dmg that a medic is needed. Atleast on pve side. Pvp i dont do so i cant comment
---
It's really useful after nuke zones &amp; events like Uranium Fever. Players tend to sell their unwanted legendaries to vendors (then drop the rest)
---
It's playing the game because the game allows for it. They aren't hacking anything or using some kind of exploit to find this person.
---
That aside, blocking and changing servers solves the issue, so you are still abusing the system because it is an issue that you can resolve yourself.
---
It has become a basic daily mechanic for most in this game. Me included. I hoped alot for leveling and grinding caps at the lumber yard on the NorthWest corner of the map. Now i really only do it if I'm getting greifed or if a quest glitches and I cant complete it. Or if someones already launching a nuke out of a silo I want to use
---
*bethesda wants to know your location*

Maybe we can find a Todd Howard statue to bring us whole &lt;3
---
NukaCola..  Need a NukaCola! 
---
If you created a more robust cap sink in the game, you could also increase the cap limit without triggering massive inflation.
---
What they should do is setup the legendary vendor on a token system where you PAY to take the legendary effect off of item A and PAY to apply it to item B. The cost could be tiered between primary, secondary and third effects for three star items.
---
People can then use their caps to either make the item them want or the item the economy wants, and more caps can freely move from one another's hands instead of the strict barter system that has developed in the absence of a cap sink. 
---
I did a quick reddit search, it seems all dailys are in fact bugged
---
If you are on ps4 I can give you a piece of legendary armor that will keep you alive (autostim) long enough to level.  Also, stay on the left upper and middle quadrants of the map.
---
Good to know, I actually saw this mentioned already in another post and was wondering the outcome of mule death. RIP
---
Have you considered trading a vendor for some adult diapers?
---
Wait, you couldn't inspect while doing player trades? How did I never notice that? Will update post, thanks!
---
Obligatory +1
---
Nope i just encounter random prize bots
---
That's an ultra asshole move. Pacifist mode keeps you from hurting them not them from hurting you. Dont waste peoples' time. 
---
I know there are a handful of resin trees on the east side of whitespring. One or two in each of the areas north and south of the entrance by the train station. I also seem to remember seeing some just east of the railroad tracks between Charleston and Sutton stations. There's some in the area just east of Pleasant Valley Station. Jump over the wall down by the pond where the brahim swim. Go around the north edge of the pond and a little further east and you should find a tree or 2. That whole area has several trees and more blackberries than you could ever use or sell.
---
If you look at that mod that fixes this, it was first uploaded before the patch. This to my knowledge has never been a feature. I hope they fix it nonetheless.
---
No, I was claiming the same 2 workshops on different servers and triggering some event spawns (like the Charleston vendor).
---
Awesome read! Merci!

i'm holding onto anything that is light. If i find an armor that has 2 or 3 stars that i can put ultralight on i will and just stash it for the vendor. anything over a pound or two goes to the vendor. Fist weapons are my favorite since they weigh like nothing.

Before when you had to worry about your C.A.M.P. being destroyed by another one I would blueprint my base. Now, it won't actually hold my C.A.M.P. and I do not even bother. It's an abandoned feature that is no longer of value.
---
Literally quote from Todd Howard "All **NEW** lighting and rendering."
---
I thought my brother was kidding once.... Sheepsquatch got him.
---
I'm sorry, just cause you can resolve it yourself doesn't mean following some one into different servers isn't harrassment. I'm not talking about following them in the same server (Though I still think it's pretty shitty if they have shown/expressed they are not interested in pvping with you), but deciding to actively follow them into other servers. That's just harassment at that point cause the person has very very very actively shown they don't want to deal with you and you are going out of your way to make sure to piss them off.
---
And then add bloody guy the 1k plus damage hits. 
---
why not?
---
That's why the gatling gun is still the strongest heavy gun imho. Not the more damaging, but its lasting power, stopping power and ammo economy makes it a  great gun.
---
Oh no, I'm saving all my 'output' in case it's needed for one of the upcoming brewing recipes. Say, you don't happen to have any spare glass junk, do you friend? Making all these mason jars is really depleting my stocks :D

---
try to put some skills into the sneak perk is my advice, then you can sneak up on enemies and get the substantial bonus damage for attacking them while you are in stealth
---
It was definitely broken in this patch. It hasn't been a feature in player trading, which is dumb, but you could definitely do it with vendors.
---
I also do the oversee camp
---
This is already a thing in fallout 4
---
Do you know how mods work? Bethesda also said they refuse to change their engine because its "easy" and the "modders know it well."
---
They had me at ;
---
All these cool masks, you should add a feature to "hide" your PA helmet so the underlying mask can show through, or your bare head if you want.

That way you don't lose the Excavator bonus because you want to wear a cool mask with your PA.

Anyone else feel like some of those underground areas looked like a vault that had a GECK run amok?

Remember when any other game ever had issues after updates? I do. 
---
I guess that‚Äôs fair, but I feel like it would be a nice endgame reward, I‚Äôd rather not pay like a million caps for a missile silo holo tape just to have it crash on me. so I feel like it would be easy to get caps and to make it more fair, or they could do what another person said and make it so for every scorchbeast you kill you a token that you can trade in for items from the enclave.
---
So far everything you've provided to defend betheada has been proven to be in error. You going to re-evaluate your first statement that betheada never lied?
---
what a pitty. I hope they fix them soon as more stuff to do in the endgame is desperately needed. Thanks for taking the time
---
Yeah I ran whitesprings last night on someone else's launch so I know the silos are working.  I am more concerned that I will need to wait 11 days between my own silo runs.  I had been clearing it myself and doing multiple queen runs on the weekend looking for prime receiver plans.  I experience no joy in sever hopping looking for scorched earth to join, so a two week cool down is less than ideal for me.
---
Ill have to look again when I get home but when I went to the craft station in the speakeasy, I believe it had beer, spirits and wine as menus to go into. In any of those menus, nukashine wasnt there. Am I using the wrong craft station and have to build my own at my camp?

Ok, I am Dr-Knightro on PSN and will be on lateish eastern time.

don't get your hopes up about getting help anytime soon. i have a bug with the damage output of all my weapons (-50%)  and I haven't heard from bethesda anymore since last friday :(  (to be honest did they contact me a couple of times on friday and issue got escalated to a specialised department but no news since then)

good luck!

No where does it indicate that you are auto placed in PvP mode.

I had something similar, but as a melee build I was basically just really hungry and thirsty all the time for no reason
---
hello, i see it  but i don't understand how does it work...(
---
Once you build your camp,  try to di it near a spot where players go frequently, like the oversee camp. I always visit and drop goods for you.

This new simulation starts it's tale with a horse drawn cart tho.
---
**I saw a super-mutant in the real world last night**, but it was just my mother-in-law

agree to disagree.

Yup, and before today there has never been colonel gutsys in watoga just mr handys.
---
As long as people can't destroy our camps then I'm down with that. I already get anxious when anyone walks within a mile radius of my camp.
---
So if a person only suspects someone else may be cheating, it's best to not report at all because you might get suspended if you're wrong?
---
I'm sure false reporting may eventually cause issues, but perhaps don't have the threshold for that set at 1.
---
Here is what you will see [https://ibb.co/P46XpRs](https://ibb.co/P46XpRs) if you're stuck with this bug.

---
Don‚Äôt forget to build scarecrows. They attack them first! Plus they look cool
---
Yeah they do....they stick around untill they die.  Or glitch out, whichever comes first!
---
Sure, but how should Bethesda go about deciding who is "falsely" reporting? If I genuinely thought someone was hacking because I'm lvl 32, and I have never seen or heard of a certain weapon or trait and I report him, it isn't malicious, simply being misinformed. (Didn't happen, just example by the way.) Maybe they could find a recording of the incident I refer to and see that the other player hasn't modified anything, but they can't know that I didn't know that.
---
Well, don't I feel stupid. I always forget to check my mods after an update....
---
Hopefully, I won't need them eventually, as they're all basically just QOL mods.
---
Thanks for the reminder.
---
ok , without activating radio in pip boy ?
---
Holy fuck.
---
New compared to fallout 4 you fucking sperg.
---
How pedantic do you have to be?
---
Must of been a measure taken to prevent that easy legendary farming in preparation for legendary vendor. I didn‚Äôt peep much of the patch notes this time as I just want to do the nukashine quest and get on with my day. But I am curious if this is another one of those stealth updates they slide into the game and leave out of the patch notes.
---
It bums me out because there are so many games that give a THOROUGH listing of changes down to the base values in most patch notes and Bethesda does the exact opposite.
---
Exactly my thoughts. I expected to be able to build maybe one additional turret. Now I have a chance against the SB‚Äôs that harass me occasionally 
---
Absolutely nothing you have said has disproven anything.
---
I missed it at first glance last night as well, but it was there.
---
Yep. On PC. *Every* quit to desktop locks up the game and the system. Have to ctrl+alt+del and have task manager end the task. I let it sit for 5 minutes one time just in case.
---
It‚Äôs not new, it‚Äôs a random event I‚Äôve had it happen quite a few times, every now and then it will spawn a legendary gutsy 
---
i put one and activate and nothing..
---
Holy crap that's good news. I used to have to take 4 count 'em 4 cryolaters into a SBQ fight. Now maybe just one or two! w00t this is great
---
did you go to the frat party first?
---
So you are saying there is all new lighting and rendering? If you dont have access to the source code then you cant prove or disprove that there is or isn't all new lighting and rendering.
---
 ...except you can prove that the only visual differences to the player are those made from a modder in fallout 4 that bethesda ripped from. You know.. the people who made their game any good to begin with.
---
You modded the other games for 10 years because vanilla they suck ass like fo76.
---
It should totally be a choice to show it or not :) but I‚Äôm down for passive mode invincible camps (and pets) in adventure mode 
---
Ok, but you're wrong :P.
---
They will always be available lol
---
Weird, never seen it before in +250 hours
---
it personally doesnt bother me. I usually hit up watoga HS or cat lady house once a session and end up with 500+ shells for my effort with ammosmith and super duper. when i get down to 100 shells i do it again. It seems better than trying to farm .50 cal. 
---
I woke up in a trailer in the Ash Heap
---
You are right and if the game had a way to produce more useful rolls, that could be all we need. A furious dragon? How many shots while I be taking to build up the furious effect? 
---
I'm guessing the note did not load in properly. If you have modded the game, try uninstalling your mods until they're updated by the author.
---
reported
---
Go get 'em, Shroud!
---
Because Bethesda ripped it from a modder. It would he identical to fo4 if they didnt.
---
So what do we milk for "Milk of human kindness"?
---
All us BOS folk want to use the BOS gun of choice, the laser rifle. But we can't. They simply don't do enough damage to be usable. I in fact have never seen anyone BOS or not using a laser rifle. You just don't see it used, ever, and it's such a HUGE waste!! 
---
Most of it was pretty much scripted and is not really available to play is my guess.
---
I judge the economy by how much things are selling for in USD$$ on websites. 
---
Months ago thr economy was saturated with dupes. Top end weapons or armor was selling for 5 bucks. 
---
Now, its about 20 to 35 USD for a top end weapon and up to 80 USD for a 5 piece 3 star end game armor set. Which is on par with other games with healthy economies. 
---
The issue is caps. Most good items are preferred trade. Not sure what to do about caps but this is starting to feel like Diablo 2 where some odd duped item may become the standard for trades. If any older gamers remember when the diablo2 economy was driven by SoJ's as currency. Lol (it's a duped item, stone of jordan iirc)
---
Disclaimer: *I do not partake or endorse purchasing in game items with USD, It is merely a metric to evaluate the health of the in game economy*
---
A big contribution to the flaws in the game were dupers crafting thousands of items in minutes causing the servers to become unstable and crash and in even worse cases it would role back people's progress about 10 minutes but they didn't care as long as they got there duplicated gear.
---
u/Ladydavann
---
i have kind of the same problem, im not able to login one of my characters after playing for a while after the server maintenance was completed.
---
i send in a ticket, but didnt got any helpful respond for now, just basic tip(router restart, game repair, firewall setting, etc) which i already tried without success.
---
the lkast response is now i should send in feedback for the devs. 
---
so i guess the support isnt able to help with this problem atm?
---
Did any of them spawn as legendary?
---
Your aware your in-game behavior is going to get you reported for harassment and the problem isn't your behavior but the large number of other players interpretation of your behavior.
---
When I played the LOTRO mmo you get drunk enough that you would pass out and wake up in unexpected locations, some that you could not otherwise get to.  It became a sport for some people.

Thank you for sharing with us. I just moved my camp from where I had it for the last 7 weeks so that I can use a full size water purifier for more water and rebuilt a house to fit two more crafting table in it. Now I'm gonna be to scared to use them though. I'll probably just hoard the materials until we get a notice that the tables are safe to use.
---
No
---
I think i figured what causes the glitch it is after you place your camp down and then move the camp bench in a zone that you can't originally place it, it has something to do on the the way it loads it and the update reading the camp bench location instead of the orginal placement of the camp/zone
---
Forgot the "son" -.5
---
Buy/learn the treated one, then you'll start to see the next upgrade. Keep going and you'll eventually start seeing the shielded upgrade once all others are learned.
---
yup, 1\* items have lost all value now so it's hard to see them as good rewards. I get my silo tapes from the vertibots that carry them, you know you can do that from the Enclave Bunker, right?
---
I've seen that quite a few times when clearing Watoga. For me, they usually show up in a gang of 5 or 6.

I have. Just made a post about it.

Can't enter the parlor... Looking to see if there another quest to make more booze

After dealing with the obvious ones, that's up for them to decide. But you know people have to have at least tried and possibly succeeded in abusing that feature out of rage for losing. People can be very petty like that. 
---
Forward station delta if you're not afraid of scorchbeasts.  it often spawns rad ants for me in sets of three.
---
Yes I completed that all last night 
---
When I was server hopping a lot a few months ago it would happen fairly often but since January it seems to have become a less common occurrence 
---
Not for me. They took time to explode, like enough time to walk up and get a face full of shrapnel. 
---
This vault doesnt have a number? "Vault Purple"

Maybe leave the spoilers out of the title... goddamnit.

I did the whole questline last night... including the daily after it... did you miss a step of the questline?
---
I think i figured what causes the glitch is after you place your camp down and then move the camp bench in a zone that you can't originally place it, it has something to do on the the way it loads it and the update reading the camp bench location instead of the orginal placement of the camp/zone. So be careful where you move the bench after you finish building or don't move if your not sure. 
---
Same. It was swarming with possums. 
---
For the Record,
---
Ultracite Lasers CAN be Legendary. It's Ultracite GATLING Lasers that cannot. 
---
And the Ultracite weapons are not identical to their normal counterparts. Ultracite Lasers have a higher ROF and lower damage compared to the normal Laser, and Ultracite Gatling Lasers do a little more damage than the normal variety.
---
Did you ever find out how much it trades for?
---
did you go to the back door
---
I saw my camp had more capacity to build after the update so I started making it more homey.  Then I hear missiles. I hardly ever hear missiles! I run outside and my missile and laser turrets were firing pretty far off down the road. It was awesome! I knew I saved them for a reason!  They really come in handy when there is a scorch beast because it takes some pressure off of me, though costly to repair.
---
Lol yeah üòÇ but ofc in rng based games there will be a lot of shitty drops, 1 point they could start with is make it that 2 * and 3* would drop guaranteed 2 &amp; 3 * and so on. But ofc is someone plays casually and does not care its fine. I usully give away all legendaries if i know i cant sell em. I see lots of high lvl players with non legendary weapons all the time
---
Huh. well I feel stupid, I thought it was only keycards.
---
Unfortunately no, you never could inspect in player trading. If you clicked the R3 (on PS4) it would switch to "show items up for trade" screen. This has been discussed before and it was always frustrating because you never knew for sure what you were trading or looking at when you trade with another player. 
---
Oh, I know that car, but it‚Äôs not the one I woke up in...I was further east.

Imagine waking up with that hangover and having to deal with that big bastard!

No no,

---
"Hey Bethesda, this guy called me (insert hate speech here)."
---
Yeah the no legendary loot is still a thing. 
---
Has anyone else been getting level 34/40 loot at White Springs from full level ghouls? This started before the latest patch for me, like last week. 
---
This has been happening to me.  I used to have a camp in the forest and when I logged in I would usually immediately get ecological balance.  If I walked over into the ash pile one of the Camden park would then show up.  I‚Äôve moved my camp up close to the top of the world and if I fast travel to try and trigger one the mire daily‚Äôs I haven‚Äôt gotten one in weeks.  Last night I loaded in at Camden park and a daily immediately showed up so I completed it.  Then after time in the forest completing the nuka shine quest I noted no forest daily‚Äôs has been started.  After a few hours of playing I went to the toxic lake by grafton steel for the event swarm of suitors.  That triggered the daily at the target range but after I had been to every other region in the game.  
---
yeh, there's a science perk card that reduces costs too. I found about both of these the day i got my final mod! I did a post that day and some people replied with tips, it might be worth a look!
---
They could still take useless legendary effects out of the table for items they won't apply to. Or weight them so that you would be unlucky to get a useless roll instead of winning the lottery when you get one that makes sense. 
---
Sharing is caring. It's always been that way, allows people to do what they want, when they want. No reason to have to wait for a static respawn timer just because someone else was there before you.
---
I have! It‚Äôs just that that music didn‚Äôt turn down my radio
---
how rare is Science Scribe outfit? I‚Äôve only seen it once and i never see anyone else wear it.
---
ESO breaks after every DLC. EVERY SINGLE ONE.  Its still a widely popular game. FO76 has made HUGE improvements from BETA, Give it time.
---
I'm hoping maybe this is a sign we may get wallpaper, but yes, I need that Nuka Cola lamp real bad.
---
I have two toons full of those useless legendary items for when the vendor drops just incase it ends up being a quantity system as opposed to a quality mechanic. 
---
Then why do they have 18 melee damage cards if you can only partially complete that. Sounds like terrible game design. Can add that to the list 
---
Morgan Town, there is a fraternity, but first you need to read the party poster at the train station, or you can grab it from Atomic Shop. 
---
One issue besides the rarity of Legendary is the randomness of them.  In other MMOs, you have ways to try for specific gear. Like in ESO, if you want a certain gear set, you grind a particular dungeon to get it. In Fo76, every legendary enemy has the same loot list so the strategy is just find a place with high lvl Legendaries and hope the RNG gods smile on you. We need a way to try for certain effects
---
Does seem like they drop less the last few weeks. I used to get hand mades/lever actions too. 
---
I kill SBs all the time, my running days are done. Plus they taste yummy.
---
We really need to stop beating this dead horse...
---
Wonder what oil they‚Äôve been giving him, looks like he needs to see a mechanic 
---
Get a good melee or another weapon you have plenty of excess ammo for and go clear out Morgantown Airport, inside and out, Morgantown Trainyard, Helvetia, and Sutton. You'll be swimming in .308. If you're strong enough, swing over to Summersville for some gunpowder and make your own. Have lead tagged so you can pick up anything that has it. At a low level, .45 is harder to find, but .308 should be no problem. So farm 308 and make 45.
---
Ok I‚Äôm bored now (and at work :))
---
If only there was some way you could see if someone else has had exactly this same issue?
---
My brain automatically read that in the protectron voice.
---
Yes... 
---
same for me, logged first time in 2 month for the first real update, and i'm falling. 
---
Is that a new outfit ? A Responder uniform of some sort ?
---
Harvest cranberries in farms and make cranberry cobblers that give you do boost. Find super mutant spawn locations. Super mutants give you a lot of xp. Once you leveled up a bit you can use mutations that help you in most aspects of survival, have access to better weapons and armor. The only thing I found hard in the beginning levels was to get enough ammo. You can save up caps and buy them here or take the munitions workshop and pray nobody will pvp you.
---
ah and yes, i can't see 80% of the items on the atomshop or idk the name
---
I‚Äôm 100% behind this. 
---
The proximity respawn for new players is actually one of the most player friendly mechanics in the game and keeps people from hoarding an area for loot.
---
I think it's working beautifully in that regard. 
---
A step in the right direction, to be sure.  I hope this trend continues and down the line I might try it again.  :)
---
I haven‚Äôt played a lot since the update. But I noticed the opposite last night. An area was respawned at a much higher level while I was still in the middle of clearing it.
---
The issue isn't about not wanting to share, it's fine by me. I just hate walking around just to have a bunch of overpowered super mutants spawn around me. It's not like i somehow missed killing a dozen of them in the school in Grafton. As someone who like to sneak and snipe this leaves me extremely exposed due to issues far beyond my control. 
---
Yeah that may help the situation. Its just so far away 
---
That creature looks more like Star-Spawned. 
---
Thanks. Is it possible to untag resources?
---
I don't know how lol. I guess I got lucky, I did all mine within 20 minutes.
---
Pvp isn't actively possible until you hit level 5.
---
Just go slow and steady and get perks you think sound useful. There is no wrong way to play the game, just do what sounds fun. If you find yourself running out of aid and ammo or tough creatures, you can fast travel for free back to vault 76 and "start over". The enemies near the vault are quite easy and there is a gun immediately to the right of the exit of vault 76.
---
Thank you! Been looking for this.
---
I really wish there was a viable single-player method for twinking alts. Maybe when they implement the ‚Äúrejoin last server‚Äù functionality. 
---
Im so excited for player vending! I actually moved my camp out of the mountains and next to a bridge so people can find it easier once the vending thing starts! I have alot of stuff to sell but I hate using the community pages to do it. With a proper Pacifist Mode and invincible camps, I cant wait to be a vendor!
---
it works, i have to restart the game...
---
Yeah , the reporting feature is gonna get flooded with trolls. Another one of them Good ideas, Bad Ideas 
---

---
Try playing without mods. This is a common issue for pc players using mods after an update. A quick search using your keywords will point you in the right direction. 
---
I have only one character so I couldn't try it.
---
I have 4 charisma am i able to tame one with just max waste land whisperer?  Or w animal friend rnk 1 and the above mentioned? 
---
That vault does not show up on the pipboy location finder either.
---
Haha, that's great.
---
They make you weigh the cost/benefit of the perks you want. There isn't any build where you get everything you want.
---
Try taking just 1* in each of the melee dmg perks, instead of maxing them all.
---
On my melee alt, I have 
---
3* Barbarian
---
3* Blocker
---
3* Incisor
---
3* Martial Artist
---
1* Slugger
---
1* Expert Slugger
---
1* Master Slugger
---
Not everything, but for min/max it does what I need.
---
First you need to read the party poster at one of the railroad stations, or grab a copy from the Atomic Shop. After that it will show you the location of the fraternity  in Morgantown. From there you will go inside the fraternity and that starts the quest. Go up stairs to the terminal and that starts the second part of the Quest, I will leave it there for you, I don't want to spoil the rest  lol! Have fun, hope too see you in the wasteland literally lol! 
---
Yes. Have some junk on you that has that resource, go to the junk menu, look at the bottom for the different button options and go to the component view. Highlight the component you want to tag/untag, and hit the appropriate button. I have a bug on mine where I can't untag cork for some reason. And sometimes things stay tagged/untagged until you logout and log back in. 
---
I woke up at the mad hatters tea party both times I drank nukashine.
---
üëç
---
Unfortunately a lot of us are victim to this. I accidentally bought atom shop items a couple of times. Please leave salt at the door. 
---
Thanks for the advice. I am planning on taking my time as I've heard it can become quite empty of quests after a certain amount of time. I've been wanting to pull the trigger on this game for a while, and theres no other game I have enjoyed exploration in as much as Fallout.
---
I know how you feel. Every time I see a globe I think screws and clipboards I think springs.
---
Everything is easy to deal with once you get a correct build. Currently ghouls are usually farmed for legendary's. It's far easier and quicker to kill 10 level 62 ghouls than 1 scorchbeast.  
---
I guess my crazy doctor character is a responsible drunk, because he woke up at his own camp, lmao.
---
I had to reinstall. Its the mods :(
---
You're not convincing anyone that a modder changed the core engine if the game mate.
---
You killed your mule on purpose hoping the junk would drop so you could transfer it 
---
nope, when you go into the military bit and up the stairs walk straight ahead to the corner of that first room, there;'s a terminal there that will give you a mini quest to track a cargo bot, shoot it down, grab the keycard, bob's your uncle!
---
Really suits the drink lol
---
&gt; that Nuka-Cola machine speak easy door
---
omfg yes
---
&gt; I thought what the heck and went ahead and picked the lock even though it warned me about "Stealing from someone else."
---
I dislike griefers as much as the next guy, but  dude, come one.   Stealing makes you a target, as it should. 
---
Thought so myself.
---
I am locked out of the tattoo parlor
---
At least you get ballistic fiber ;D
---
Lmao keep your delusions
---
No he died because you cant eat or drink and then a supermutant that spawned shot him in the head.
---
Maybe a cool down timer? That sucks
---
Last night i killed a dude with a 500 cap bounty. 
---
He then reported me for cheating..
---
I have a scarecrow, some fences around the area, and a bunch of oil lamp posts.
---
But my one level 4 turret on the corner roof of my house wasn't cutting it.
---
We'll see how they like 9 heavy machine gun turrets lined up around the roof of my house overlooking my generator, garden, cow, and junk extractor now!
---
Oh god you brought back the Morrowind PTSD "SCREECH SCREECH SCREECH"
---
I think the flatwoods vendor has them. 
---
Relogged and it let me go in
---
No offense but that‚Äôs a terrible build 
---
It‚Äôs a bug. Bethesda is trying to fix it. Sounds like it comes and goes
---
Good to know. That is exactly my experience so I am not the only one with that problem. u/valseek and u/ladydevann can you add this to the known-issues-list or pass it on to the devs? thx!
---
Wow, I never thought to throw that on since it requires gunsmith. Thanks a ton!
---
I thought the same thing when doing the quest last night! LOVED that room, And LOVED the Nuka Cola Machine door! I NEED ALL THE NUKA COLA/NUKA GIRL THINGS! üòç
---
that's always going to be a plus.
---
I would call this a bonus.
---
Can we please have a gaggle of gutsies every single time we kill a 'native' robot and never ending spawns of 'native' robots?
---
I might never leave Watoga again.
---
Finally a killing field overflowing with lead.
---
Oh the joy!
---
I have, I've gotten quite a few legendaries in a few golf club runs post patch. Maybe less than before, but it'd be negligible. 
---
He's ascended in order to become the ultimate lifeform that can defeat all Commies
---
Did you open the nuka cola machine
---
I saw him yesterday too, though he told me he was not on duty (or something like that). I was hoping to get some sort of creative insult, but alas, just disappointment. LOL
---
I got an old opossum recipe this morning 
---
You have to scrap to learn the **True (or Stabilized) Long Barrel** plans. /s
---
I swore I saw the plan at Sutton, Grafton, or Morgantown.  I will keep an eye out, on PC too.  Feel free to add me.
---
I didn‚Äôt mean to infer it doesn‚Äôt happen at all. I just think there‚Äôs a few bad eggs doing it, it‚Äôs not a super widespread thing.
---
So just talk to the bot?
---
Enjoy the patch. I legit haven't been able to play the past month due to an acute case of flap limb, which is presenting with jelly fingers and lock joint.
---
I‚Äôm a Nukaoholic . More More More
---
Oh good. I saw some people saying they implemented it to prevent people from dropping too many nukes, glad to hear it's just a bug.
---
My personal tip would be to follow the main quest line for a bit until it tells you to go to the top of the world, because then you will have basic knowledge from the starting quests but you will have time to learn more about the game yourself before continuing the main story
---
Yeah, I never had much luck with  Lvl 4 turrets being effective. I switched to 2 Lvl 28 missile turrets and one heavy machine gun. But honestly the heavy machine gun never sees any action since the missiles obliterate any mobs.
---
I haven't played in 2 months. Waiting for it to get better. Is it time to try and come back?
---
Just give in. 
---
"Turning"? Fallout has been wacky since the turn-based games.
---
I think the next part starts 24 hours after completing wasted on nukashine
---
Noticed this you can‚Äôt inspect on vendors either apparently 
---
i'm used to running it for an hour or 2 and getting so many. I need to launch some more nukes and experiment, unfortunately i have the silo bug now and can't launch for 220 hours! I am curious about your statement that there are less that you notice but still consider it negligible, could you expand?
---
rusrs?
---
I've only launched twice. ... Didn't know. 
---
Put in a support ticket and ask for a refund.  They seem to be pretty good about helping in cases like this.
---
Pretty sure they at the WhiteSpring vendor ? Have you checked, I bought a lot of camp plans there
---
yerp, i only run 5 INT so it wouldn't have been much use to me!
---
This happens to me often in Watoga.  Has for a while now.
---
Suddenly about 10 level 52 Colonel Gutsy's spawn.  And boy do those AA Bullets hut.
---
I've seen them come out of AMS and the High School.  I saw them show up in the isle behind Phoenix once.  I've been attacked by them four times in the last month.
---
I suddenly here "Is there someone who needs me to kick their ass" and I know I need to get my AA Handmade out quick before I get overrun.
---
First time I saw them, they came out of the AMS building.  I actually assumed it was some bug and it was the Gutsy enemies inside AMS somehow aggroing me and exiting the building.  But then it happened 3 more times.  So I figured it was just some random event.
---
Once it happened I wasn't even killing robots, I was just going to the Comic Book store behind Phoenix after vendoring, and they spawned down the alleyway.
---
I'm deliberately going to sell super rare plans on the cheap but you have to find my camp first
---
If there genuinely is a Sten I'm hyped! Always thought they'd fit right into Fallout, plus as an Englishman I feel it is one of our signature guns. 
---
Same problem, and I don't even mod, and never had any customs ini file created before. 
---
I woke up on a stage in front of rows of empty seats outdoors in the middle of toxic valley near the putt-putt golf course lol! Halfway expected wake up in Markarth!
---
Good idea except the farming of animals - I‚Äôd rather this vile practice kept out of the game.
---
What I‚Äôd like to see instead?.
---
Maybe the egg one is fine but animal taming such as hounds as companions.
---
The rest of your ideas are pretty good - we definitely need planters for crops und I‚Äôd like to see a fridge or food storage of sorts added so that you could store food then prevent it from expiring too quickly.
---
Just an example. I only use it for ammo/mat farming and playing around with non-rifle/crit perks.
---
I‚Äôm on a cliff by the ski lanes under near the ammunition‚Äôs lot. Never had my camp removed, and it works when my character is a ranger marshal and with the nuka shine quest I got this hidden cliff where I can brew, craft, and lounge in private 
---
Na, it is just a random existing event.  It wasn't added this patch, I've been attacked by them all on multiple occasions before.
---
Dutchrudders151 shoot me an add and we can tear it up on the grind for exp and loots
---
Stop acting like bethesda only added them back because of you.
---
That's good news, i haven't been able to place anything on the round rug since the patch, which I was able to do with ease before.
---
So what's with the two new vaults? 51 and 65?
---
Probably closer to the real truth. 
---
ooh, that gives me something to do with level 5 legendaries I get, drop them off at the overseers cache...
---
The only people who enjoy pvp have full sets of 3* legendary gear that were among some of the most heavily duped weapons and armors.  Either you have this supposed-to-be super rare gear(all legit drops, obviously) or you get completely wrecked in PvP.
---
Maybe if duping was never a thing and there was some remote semblance of balance PvP would be a fun side activity.  That's not reality though. Getting regularly oneshotted by people who stand still and never take damage will never be immersive or enjoyable.
---
If you didn‚Äôt get banned it doesn‚Äôt matter if they reported you. If you weren‚Äôt doing anything wrong. 
---
Good bot
---
I will take a look later today. So far, I have checked most of the vendors in the Forest sector.
---
Do events and daily quest that pop up. Don't worry about dying. 
---
For the love of god. Before making a post about a bug, search to see if there are other posts. If you had taken the few seconds to search, you could see that there are way too many posts talking about this bug. In short, it‚Äôs your mods conflicting with the game. 
---
Id like to know this...one of the challenges yesterday was to brew 10 different things...pretty sure im only capable of making 5 things total right now, at the brew station.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs gonna happen hopefully they are just trying to scare you and if Bethesda looks into it more than likely they will be able to see you aren‚Äôt cheating.
---
Half of my raider PA is gone now üò≠
---
I woke up in skyrim intro
---
Sometimes they do!
---
Hey, I think I saw them on the subreddit a few hours back.
---
My original CAMP used 2x Laser Turrets.  They worked fairly well, but they cost a TON of budget at the time.  So I just abandoned them all together.  But now that there is very little budget cost, I decided to put defenses up again rather than just relying on myself to clear out things.
---
I'm pretty sure I saw that in Sutton earlier today.
---
Did you do the quest, you can only enter when you're solving the riddle.
---
I killed almost 30 protectrons last night and maybe around 5 were legendary. None of mine blew up, not even the legendary assaultron.
---
I only know one. Lol
---
Could've sworn I saw some starlight berries on the way to work today
---
I was using one mod: Save My Stuff
---
Beta had them
---
The first location it transported to was the Alice in Wonderland style dinner table set up in the middle of nowhere. I had already found this and took a picture of it with me standing in my underwear next to it. 
---
A raider church north of Sunnytop. Looked like the pastor shot the entire congregation and then himself.
---
Yes but useless against most enemies due to no armor penetration.
---
Doesn't it goddam suck how much people hate this game? People be calling us F76 cultists.
---
Lmao got me 
---
Can I please get an OBJECTIVE answer:
---
Is it good yet?
---
Oh no we are in for a lot of these posts aren‚Äôt we. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry. 
---
Most multiplayer games have a reporting feature. It does not result it automated bans. It‚Äôs a way to gather extra data on players. An account usually isn‚Äôt flagged until it gets a lot of reports of the same nature. And even then, the issue is looked at with an objective real person. 
---
I have had the occasional gutsy go hostile but never had them all try and come after me. Kinda like only the ones that witness the murder of their friends 
---
So funnily enough I got trashed last night and decided "what better way to game drunk than to pursue the in-game brewing quest?" I got sidetracked before finishing, but drunk me totally could have done this, especially since my current build uses a lot of "no really be drunk" perks. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I really wouldn't worry about it. You'd need a statistically aberrant amount of reports just to get your account reviewed, and even then no one is going to instaban you based on some whiny kid.
---
Chems
---
Encountered him closer to Watoga today. Almost due north of the Civic Center, by the road sign and within sight of the bot stop.
---
Ummm I don't rightfully know. Everything I've read and saw explained you need animal friend 3 *and* wasteland whisperer 3 to have the option to tame a creature. Without both at 3, you only get a chance to temporarily pacficy said creature based on your current charisma stat. 
---
Mine wouldn‚Äôt show up at first either. I crafted a whisky then beer then nukashine showed up for me. Had to go back for more ingredients a few times. It was a little buggy but I finished it eventually lol
---
Sometimes, very rarely, a Colonel Gutsy and a Protectron will fall in love.
---
This is the story of how they mass produced offspring and took over the world.
---
‚ÄúEyed‚Äù Piper
---
Or the Vault 
---
Sadly I don't own a PS4, but thank you.
---
Go up the stairs to the platform above it and there's a way to drop in from the top. Should be a set of raider PA in there. 
---
Are you working on the full changelog? I really look forward to your work on these.
---
I‚Äôm going to start always ending my game in the mire so it‚Äôs where I load in the next day and see if that makes a difference.  
---
Ya'll need to host the next one in the nukashine speakeasy
---
Doesn't appear to have been fixed.  I accidentally scrapped some of my bulk leather in the Whitespring bunker last night vendoring (New Bunker Stash Box is a major win though).
---
They said they have to make a larger change to the system to classify Bulk as being consumed when Repairing/Crafting, but NOT when Auto Scrapping.  Related to the Mod consumption fix a couple patches ago.
---
For now be careful carrying Bulk Scrap in your inventory.  I only take it out when I'm going to sell right away.
---
I removed the door to have a look inside, there's [nothing inside](https://i.imgur.com/TzUva9h.jpg) :(
---
or the Macbeth shot in Online
---
Danke Bruder, werde dich adden
---
Very excellent consolidation of lore. I have been taking photos at each of these holy sites. How does the cult of Atom connect?
---
This is really nice for me. I tend to go AFK at 2:30 to get my kid off the bus one block away. When the bus is on time, I can make it back before disconnect well rested and ready to harvest my farm again before heading out for questing/looting. The extra wiggle room will help me settle on a server I like before the usual errand and return ready for my play session
---
Hey I'm on Xbox too gladly pay you 3k for the BoS leg plans let me know
---
Went to the sickleman. Freaked me out
---
Just because a game is released with bugs doesn't mean they didn't test it. The millions of lines of code interacting with millions of unique setups is nearly impossible to test for. Even if bethesda had a team of 100 testers, that's a drop in the bucket compared to the user base.
---
tl;dr relax 
---
I though this sub got replaced with the anthem one what the heck
---
Yeah, I find that I'm more mindful before scrapping all. 
---
It's this kind of thinking that put Mr. Pebbles on the moon!
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had the same, but strangely, after yesterday‚Äôs patch it was a lot quicker. Will see what it‚Äôs like when I play again tonight.
---
I prefer their current ability to drop ultracite plans, at end game levels you can chew up scorchbeast with any class. At low levels they should be a terror, it's why they killed every living person. 
---
Bethesda stated this is not a bug. Down the line they may set up the ability for players to flag items they do not want scrapped. Until then, place bulk items in your stash so they do not get get scrapped.
---
Each time it has happened to me, it has been many Gutsies all at once.  First time there must have been 10 of them pouring out of AMS.  Scared the crap out of me cause I heard them but thought it would be a passive robot just aggroing some Mutants or Scorched down outside the town.  Instead they start tearing me a new one.
---
Agreed - steel is totally my bottleneck for ammo these days. With some minor changes to my daily vendor run and a couple outdoor spots to hit lead veins, I don't even step into Lucky Hole anymore (which honestly just changed the bottleneck to acid which is even more annoying to get).
---
I've considered moving some occasionally-used guns over to Prime receivers since the ammo is less steel intensive.
---
Sometimes it turns in to vintage nukashine without you noticing maybe ?
---
For me there was a few seconds where the door was boarded up in the middle of the quest line. But it quickly reloaded and revealed the actual door to the parlour. If that happens again, maybe just try reloading the game. I only had to wait a couple seconds in game though. 
---
I hope its all a simulation so the retcons dont apply to Fo5.
---
I know. Its just annoying how easily people get butthurt
---
Get an empty PA frame this helps a lot with strength. Levels 1-10 or 1-15 are the hardest, after that you should be able to take care of yourself. Get the raider PA at level 15 or start collecting it so it is ready by the time you get to level 15.
---
Make sure you levelling up your strength tree with things like slugger and Basher and I recommend using melee weapons until or if you want to switch to guns or using a combination of both.
---
Stay in the middle of the map until you ready to move to high level areas and take more on. I spend a lot of time in the middle and west until I felt ready and had lots to do.
---
I wish so much that you folks were on PC :(
---
50s do too. All scorchbeast drop marine/ultracite plans. 
---
Brick walls are pretty clean
---
Considering I was the only person to my knowledge who made a thread regarding the matter which attracted a community manager of bethesda, I am allowed to say that the thread was part of if not the whole reason why it was added back and unless you can disprove that, what right do you have to shut that down 
---
That would be crazy. It‚Äôs one of the few endgame activities. 
---
They said it was something they couldn't fix right now and had to make a larger change to make it work the way we want.  It's not a "bug" but an unintended consequence of the Mod Consumption fix a couple patches ago, while still letting Bulk be consumed for Crafting/Repairing.
---
I need that lamp!! 
---
You got mods
---
It's coming. In fact, we're finalizing our own version of Cross-Play as we speak. Trust your HOA, we won't let you down... unless you build a square floating box held up by stairs alone. 
---
Yes
---
We were getting legendaries from non-legendary ghouls last night. Was weird.
---
Hmm, you of potentially garnered hostility in AMS. All robots in there are 100% hostile. Kinda like if you go into a medical center and piss off a bunch of supermutants. When you leave the building they will all chase you outside. Not to say you went Into AMS but they way you describe it seems you‚Äôre somehow drawing the aggro from the enemies in AMS.
---
BIV's daily quests reward recipes.  And a random event Lemonade vendor sells some.
---
Yes. The time seems to be a bit longer sometimes after yesterday's patch.
---
Thank u
---
fantastic
---
That would be really cool but I'm betting the fact that they're already done that is why it isn't a thing here (also it seems like a pretty low barrier to entry to do it, I think they want people to access this pretty early on)
---
Yeah. They just dont get how easy a one hit melee pvp build is to make. And probly dont know what vats does for mellee range and accuracy
---
Right? If anything I think they need to add new nuke zone bosses for each region since killing the queen over and over again gets a little old
---
I just ignore em man, casual gamers are soft. It‚Äôs such a repetitive loop of crying and trolling and hearing you‚Äôre getting reported and banned, I just go on with my day. It‚Äôs almost unavoidable nowadays 
---
Maybe you turned off the radio's in audio? Either way they're a nice addition to Camps especially when you want to listen to some music at your camp whilst practising your banjo or piano or cooking up a batch of nukashine whilst listening to country roads or sandman
---
All Responder vendors stock it.
---
Really? Can i get a link.lol
---
March 19th. All will be revealed on that day. 
---
Bethesda has done a pretty good job of rewarding help (they get event rewards for defending your workshop) as well as making griefing low level players unrewarding (what they take from you will never be worth the bounty on their head or losing their junk either). For the most part, a lot of bored high-level players spend a lot of time CAMPing near early game areas and dumping off un-needed inventory for nothing. I personally CAMP in a high level area central to the locations I like to loot when I log in then I'll swing by lower level areas if the server seems decently populated and drop things I don't need to scrap for plans anymore
---
That time though, I had not stepped into AMS at all.  I walked into Watoga from the West Train Car, reached the Vertibot, and suddenly there were Gutsies everywhere.
---
And they have appeared behind Phoenix in the Alley when I showed up to sell stuff, and at the High School when I walked around from the Station.  It really is just a random event that occurs.  At least 4 times for me in the last month or two.
---
Nope, you're getting the full PvP experience!!
---
Woke up at sickleman. Thought it was a pre war plot to murder to jock frat if they got in. 
---
He's just got his melee build perfected, that's it.
---
It could be a bloodied build, and power armor isn't as protective as you would imagine, different armor types are much more powerful. 
---
It absolutely was not. People have been complaining about this for months. That mod was created a week before the patch. What was it fixing if this feature just broke? The link below is essentially the same complaint as OP, except it was posted last month
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alet92/psa_vendor_inspecting_broken_with_latest_patch/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Probably have the 20 hour wait.. like most resets.
---
This is another feature. More proof that the game world is actually a buggy virtual reality.  Congratulations, you win the game!
---
It was honestly hilarious. I sponged 100s of bullets, nades etc.
---
To call it a content drop is an insane stretch. It's one quest to craft alcoholic beverages with other single quests/events in the future. No one is denying bug fixes. But that's not content. That's fixes. Even some of the other stuff is fixing how to do something. Like reaching the Atomic Shop from the crafting menu. 
---
Think back to Oblivion with the Shivering Isles or Fo3 and Point Look Out. These were whole new worlds with new items, quests, and characters. Games as a "service" just aren't as exciting. Idk maybe these were before your time.
---
Also, the patch size isn't indicative of anything. Fo76's prior patches were larger and wasn't a part of a new "content" drop. It has to do with how the game code is structured and can be delivered.
---
This bug comes and goes with the patches. I usually just log off my windows account to exit the game.
---
Yes we are. Haha
---
Nuked ghouls at whitesprings are probably legendary 1 out of 10 times. If all scorchbeast are legendary I could farm prime the glassed cavern any time. I do it pretty often anyway. Scorchbeast have a good rare drop table. 
---
hopefully there will be an in-game option as well though. 
---
I rebuilt my base 4 times  every time I load in it sez it interferes with new content even if I just completed the base and just jump servers.
---
I love lamp.
---
The guy/girl was probably using an Unyielding build. You get +3 to all stats when low health. The lower your health, the stronger the damage. Thats why people use Bloodied weapons. They increase damage the lower your health as well.
---
Been on servers that crashed an never once lost ten mins of progress... worse was putting me back to where i fast traveled from ( crash ten seconds after fast traveling somewhere ) 
---
I think if you could be more specific that the forum would be more helpful ( without spoilers ). Are you dying right after you leave the vault - level 2-5 or later ?
---
If early, level 2-5 then I would suggest slowing way down and explore the area around the vault. You will discover a lot of helpful items and face less challenging encounters. Also - use VATS to look for enemies and don't be afraid ( pun intended ) to just run away if you are getting beat down.
---
Submit a ticket, they'll refund it. They have done it for people before.
---
Just be glad it quits at all! When it was first released, it wouldn't quit to the desktop at all (at least for many people; don't want to exaggerate).
---
It does help to quit to main menu first, and then quit to desktop (again, at least it used to be the case). Even doing that, I find it takes at least 10-20 to get back to just the launcher. I don't have the latest patch though (work/life, y'know).
---
Anti armor melee is a thing. Even wearing power armor makes it feel like you are simply wearing a hazmat suit. If I were you, I would not have humored the guy at all by retaliating. He was obviously ready to ko you.
---
By the way.... F. 
---
Food and drink items now spoil insanely fast. I can have corn and razorgrain in my inventory spoil in the matter of 5-10 minutes, when it would last multiple hours pre-patch.
---
I have done a little searching, and it seems i am not the only one with this problem.
---
My main is 203 and when I'm playing it my primary form of entertainment lately is "stealth-helping" new characters.  I'm a full chameleon-sniper build so I'll "stalk" the lowbie following them unseen, and once they've tagged a mob I'll one-shot it from the shadows.
---
The devious side of me snickers as the lowbie starts looking around in confusion wondering what the heck just happened to cause the mobs they were fighting to suddenly die.  Then after helping them for a while I show myself and drop a crafted Brotherhood Sniper Rifle, some ammo, and food/water before sneaking off to "stalk" the next lowbie.
---
This was a good benchmark test for my camerawork. I loved being part of this and look foreword to the many crazy adventures we embark on.
---
Alt + F4
---
Damn man. That was some serious heat. I love it.
---
-"IS THAT SOMEONE WHO NEEDS ME TO PROTECT AND SERVE!?"
---
THEIR ASS! 
---
\*clap\*clap\*clap\* I agree. This is one of my favorite games now and is almost the only thing I've played in the past 2 months. I played the BETA and did not get it at release, which was probably a good thing. I'm really glad I waited and avoided the frustrations of the early release. RDR2 single player was a great filler for that. Now I've found over these two months that FO76 would fill the hole that RDR2 Online left with its emptiness and blandness. I am very proud of Bethesda for trying something new and I've personally seen almost nothing but kindness and a willingness to help one another from the community. When i play this game I get a feeling of pride to be part of such a dedicated community of fans.
---
It is. Scorched earth gives you a legendary guaranteed. That being said it may glitch on occasion but you should get 2 plans and a legendary if you participate. 
---
It was unnuked, I log in/ log out at the golfclub. I did 4 golf club runs. Each golf club run netted roughly 4. That's typical, but maybe it was admittedly a small sample size. 
---
Got High Voltage Hefe yesterday
---
Last night I had placed stuff in my fermenter and later when I checked it, it was back in my inventory and not in the fermenter. 
---
My brain automatically read that in the protectsy voice.
---
Love this idea!
---
maybe a dumb question, but are you using a scope weapon? If not, perhaps try that.
---
I heard you can still do this by using some of the carpets instead. I haven't been on, but I saw someone mention it earlier today. 
---
I hate to be *that* guy, but you could just not carry bulk.
---
Its happened to the best of us, it's happened to the worst of us. Either way I will leave with this....
---
F
---
seems like it.
---
This made me super sad when I realized.  I have a nice indoor garden, and will lose it if i ever tear down camp.
---
We really need indoor garden trays.  They exist in FO4.  All of the coding is still there for it.  Plus ive seen them in the overworld here.  Hope we get that one day.
---
‚ù§Ô∏è desk fans
---
When we went up there. I saw no note. Then again maybe I missed it. So as of now no deets on this vault. 
---
This time for some reason I read it in Bivs voice.....
---
I disagree they should be that. The game is Fallout 76, not Farming Legendaries 76.
---
Are you focused PvP? Perks &amp; gear?
---
Power armor is useless in PvP...
---
Someone decked out for PvP should own you in pvp if your not focused on it. 
---
There is a wealth of info on PvP builds but they are expensive... 150k caps should get you a good PvP loadout. 
---
Levels dont matter after 50....
---
Nice, your character blackout stumbled home. Lmao.
---
ich auch und dann logout. Dann den Netwerkfehler. Wenn ich aus dem launcher starte . ist der fehler nicht mehr.schade das es bei dir nicht klappt.Vielleicht ist es auch eine Windows Berechtigung. Wenn kein zugriff da ist. Das ist was was ich komplett raus genommen habe. Ansonsten f√§llt mir gerade nichts weiteres ein was sein k√∂nnte. Nicht den launcher oder exe als admin starten. Das w√ºrde wahrscheinlich crashen. Ich meine das dein Benutzer alle Rechte hat
---
Nice. Its awesome just to have new things to do. Thanks. 
---
Your spelling reminds me of a trailer park boys episode haha
---
Sounds like what happens whenever I walk up on a random person's camp. Been getting rid of my 2 star leggies to offload, just dropping them as gifts to random players when I see them in their houses. I pull out the Santa PA to let them know what's going on with that
---
That was my intent üòé
---
He was just confirming the spot I was in, no huge secret
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Even being in a popular area doesn't nessessarily confer more risk to be honest. I'm in a well-traveled area, and while I'm out of sight I'm certainly not "hidden". I've yet to have anybody do anything fucked up to my camp. :)
---
That must be why I had the logout-login fake-safe issue. When I tested a logout/login, all I had done is built my camp. I ended up finding another place, and I believe I'm good to go in the new spot.
---
Cheers!
---
Maybe in an update??? ü§î
---
I have over 300 hours played in game, all I have left to do is try to get better gear :/
---
Did four servers with a Watoga circle route and onky the 3 star legendary blew instantly for me. But,, all 5 of them had multi star drops.
---
All other bots seemed like normal rando sploding.
---
I hate to be negative, but I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath.
---
Where you using four leaf clover perk to gain multiple crits?
---
Totally agree or have new locations that spawn crazy amounts of legendary enemies 
---
Yes you place a carpet put plants as close as possible to it then pick up the carpet and it takes the plants as well
---
you did the brewing quest, what happened in that quest?  you got where you were somehow, it took time I'm sure...
---
I had the same experience, the door get replaced after you have done the daily. Not sure if it's supposed to be a feature or a bug, but I'm betting on the last one. 
---
I'm delusional? You cant even address statements that Todd even said in e3 because you tell yourself they are true when they clearly aren't. You are the epitome of delusional.

---
Mine was to test Agility by performing a sneak attack.  I drank the rum and immediately shot a ghoul in the back.  I even got the message about 2.5x damage for a sneak attack (perk card bonus), but it did not complete the quest.  Thinking that it's bugged or I need to do melee not ranged? Either way I can't seem to complete the daily.
---
I'm stupid.  I had to read it twice and all the comments to figure out this wasn't talking about a bug with in game time.   ....or it is...and I'm just extra stupid
---
tried both, gunna get a throwing knife and see if that works
---
You can still put down a rug, put down a crop nearly on top and when you go to pick up the rug itll pick up the crop with it. If it doesnt just retry until it selects both, then wherever you place the rug the crop will grow such as a table or anywhere else
---
Do we have a thread where Bethesda made a response to this cool down timer issue?
---
just crawled behind a workbench, curled up in a corner, and slept it off.
---
Walking through IKEA, wall and shelves full of plastic pet bowls.
---
The treehouse in the Mire.
---
Did you drink rum you bought/looted or rum you made with the brewing station? It didn't work with the later.
---
I have about 450 hours in the game, and I haven't done everything. Still enjoying it, still going. 
---
Maybe take a break?
---
I went thru a similar problem after playing RDR2 Online to much before I got FO76. Whenever I'd see flocks of bird flying by I would ponder:"If I shoot all of them out of the sky I wonder how much I'd get for the feathers..."
---
Login/logout at the whitespring golf club, and get 4 legendary drops from it everytime with no nuke. That's 2-3 minutes. It takes far less time to clear the golfclub, than to go into the glassed cavern to where the scorchedbeasts are and kill 4 of them. 
---
This makes sense since it was apparent there was some incomplete quest at Arktos with those weird recipes you can pick up but then have no use for.
---
I will keep that in mind. Thanks for the information. The new update seems quite promising going by all the comments on here.
---
This.  1000x this. 
---
Ha
---
Yeah, the game needs a lot more adjusting. I‚Äôd rather see legendaries with scorchbeasts then ghouls. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm really getting at I guess 
---
Pvp ballance is bad, plus melee has been op since release 
---
Here is my ticket number: 190314-001120 How long do you think before this issue is fixed? Is there a way IT can like force respawn me in my camp or even Valt 76 or anywhere really just want to be able to play 
---
I most certainly will do them. Anything I can to expand the play time. Cheers.
---
I've never run that mod and I've always been able to inspect vendor items
---
Yeah. I believe someone said 
---
"Tjarnold2010 5 points 13 hours ago 
---
Actually, I had also removed the doors for the other vaults. You are no longer able to enter those either. I guess they have added new content and do not want anyone actually getting in!"
---
So many they did it to make sure no one peaks this time or gets in? 
---
the real secret is the other 70% of the game
---
The Modus and Map dupe methods effected servers but the methods that most used required another character to stay on the server.  There hasn't been much of a change in performance across all the patches and bans.
---
How do we know this? I don't remember seeing anything about that.
---
I was able to get to yesterday into this morning simply by spamming the interact option until he gave me them. I also seem to have a glitch every time I sign out with an active daily Quest from him when I sign back in I have a totally different Quest from him
---
It happened to me a couple times. 
---
Oh Damn, dowloaded the patch yesterday but didn‚Äôt have time to play, which side of town did you have your camp????
---
Oh I thought it was Biff from back to the future. 
---
It's not in the university, walk to the front door, turn right and go between the buildings to the street. On the left you'll discover the location
---
Aww no way thatd be hell sad, i just finished the mission and was thinking hed been kidnapped and killed but when i read he went to a vault i thought it was a happy ending.
---
As a doctor character, I may have to try this, but also dump a bunch of aid items in their loot bag as well. Lmao.
---
I usually switch between 76, destiny 2, and battlefront 2. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not enjoying the game, especially with more content releasing, I just wish the scorchbeasts had better loot and were more like boss fights  
---
&gt; Just because they're actually usable now doesn't mean they're in a good/competitive spot.
---
I would go so far as to say they aren't actually usable, not practicably at any rate. 10-ish reloads breaks a Two Shot laser, and as quickly as you go through ammo the only way you can keep using it is if you stay close to a weapon bench. Normal lasers aren't much better.
---
Remember to wait at least 15 mins before picking it up
---
/u/Ladydevann Yeah, I ran into this issue last night as well on a second character and am giving up. I am also experiencing the 'fixed/resolved' movement hangs/lags (character is walking, gets stuck, starts again. Its not my connection or computer, I can guarantee this). Maybe have Dev check and made sure they're not merging old code branches again?
---
I've spent more time troubleshooting this game than playing it. It''s just not worth it to troubleshoot this *still*-broken game, when people could spend their time actually having fun in another game that doesnt require the player to also moonlight as QA for the developers.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can sell it to a vendor if it has a purchased paint on it?   Wouldn‚Äôt let me sell my 10mm with Tricentennial paint at Watoga. 
---
The only decent thing I look forward to killing them is the exp &amp; meat. The sb meat is great after cooked, restore a bunch of hp and gives pretty good buff. I don't know about all of them being legendary.. but a least spawn in some 3 star or a 2 star here and there. That would be cool.
---
they will
---
No what is weird is a guy with 10% health can one shot a guy with 100% health, but the guy with 100% health has to hit the guy with 10% health four times.
---
Yup. 
---
Everyone is reporting PvP. 
---
Bethesda should have saved the report function for after Survival drops..
---
I guess my point is this. If the only thing left that seems to be a challenge is killing scorch beast, and the rewards for doing so, aren't worth it.
---
Then maybe the game is done for you for a while? I'm not being mean or snarky. I get you want to keep playing. But until something new is added, that is a challenge for you, maybe just put the game down.
---
Its really cool, really they shouldnt open right because the next vaults with people in them dont open for ages after the first one being 76, im not sure im not to sure of history
---
No, you could simply keep the trigger held with automatic weapons to continuously critical hit until you ran out of AP.
---
Wall decor I believe
---
All heavy ballistic weapons got a 10-20% buff and damage per shot reduced by 75% 
---
Drinkin buddy was a protectron that brewed and kept drinks cold for you, while also telling jokes.

---
Here you go Sheffield.
---
Hey, why don't you come work for me, you filthy addict.
---
Yeah, I didn't get a legendary (or any loot) from a dead queen last night, but that might be a separate queen bug. Spinny circle for several minutes and then a failure to load any loot. 
---
That‚Äôs odd because you cannot sell broken weapons.  At least I‚Äôve never been able to.  
---
I didn't mislead anyone.
---
That "build" is over-powered why can a dude with 10% health one shot people with 100% health, but he has to be hit 4 times?
---
Yeah, there are "way point markers" in the middle of many of the obstacles that you have to cross over to get credit. It isn't just about hitting the buttons, you have to pass through the markers to get credit.  
---
I'm pretty sure they know we want this option. 
---
It illuminated red, can't miss it
---
Had to mark the occasion with a pic I was so excited!
---
https://imgur.com/O9zaltc
---
As a sniper, I've learned (the hard way) to wait a few ticks before going to loot those.  Not a big deal, but I know if I was melee (or if they were too close), GTFO NOW when they die.
---
I've never seen instant detonation before, if they're doing that it's definitely new.
---
A drunken, blackout stupor was how I originally ended up with Fallout 76.
---
Like the gatling gun I have was boosted from 72ish to 86ish with the same fire rate 
---
Honestly it seems like the legendary vendor could be a big save, if it takes caps and legendaries to reroll or change legendary effects then it could be the best cap sink in the game to the point where they actually have value again
---
You never responded to 16x the detail or the canvas bag. You like to ignore statements that contradict your point dont you?
---
Yeah it must of been a bug. Not seen anything similar but it's been a while since I played. 
---
Give lamp!
---
Some folks are here for the pve and care nothing for pvp.  Heck the raoder/griefer thing even goes against the recommended path and is constantly blamed for why everyone died.
---
Wait, was it adjusted? When? May need to expand my purifiers.
---
The ultracite Gatling seems to have improved quite a bit, to the point where I think it's viable.
---
Someone should check the location for that orange dot in the northeast corner to see if something is there now too. I would but I am at work now.
---
16x detail is basically correct if the map is larger and just as detailed 
---
Nylon bag has nothing to do with the actual game that was promised 
---
Yeah because its code ripped from fallout 4 and a modder who edited several aspects of the piss poor lighting in fallout 4.
---
"iT's NoT eXpLoItInG iT iS pArT oF tHe GaMe!"
---
No it is exploiting, the dude has 10% health and one shots me, I have 100% health, and he takes four hits.
---
PvP shouldn't come down to who opened VATS first and clicked.
---
You can hack games on console, but to do it you normally need to modify your console so that it can interface with an external machine(like a computer)
---
People who play with these modded consoles are "modders"
---
I know. Like its just a game. Happened to me all the time before i got a proper build
---
Reactive plates for PA really help
---
This is what I have been thinking since day 1. Yet so far all we got was a stash box and a Quantum sign.
---
can you elaborate on the quantity of plastic bowls? lol
---
im all about that rolling pin life
---
*with my chef hat of course
---
Ok mister "my friend recoded the entire creation engine and gave fallout 4 all new rendering"
---
A drunken, blackout stupor was how I ended up with Fallout 76.
---
Use a melee whenever possible, save your ammo, use only one good gun, craft leather protection
---
OMG YES! I saw that thing and was filled with immediate sadness when i couldn't pick it up! cmooooon BGS add THAT to the atom store!
---
Is it stealing when the contents are instanced?
---
I don't think it is fun to one shot on PvP how the fuck does this community think that shit is fun?
---
You have auto-aim with VATS, that shit is not fair to be the first to hit attack
---
they should‚Äôve just extended the non nukable area to cover where the dlc is, seems stupid to stop people from launching nukes
---
Blow it out your ass.
---
Then why are there mods fixing it and people complaining about the same problem before the patch?
---
Terminals inside talk about them developing something. It could be referring to the strangler virus, but I took it to mean the scorched plague 
---
wall decor, scroll over from the mothman poster
---
Drills and syringers 
---
Odd, i had the better inventory mod installed and after disabling it everything fixed itself
---
I didn't change anything and haven't had any issues. 
---
Pretty much exact response i got. But im on xbox. Dude was literally so mad he was crying.
---
Not every single item. The player chooses which ones he wants to convert into buildable objects. After that they act like any other object that can be build (physics are turned off, and they count towards the build limit).
---
Why hide the vault number?
---
I made it in the brewing station, fermented in fermenter (appeared to be normal run in my inventory once fermented).  Are you saying I should try with just any old rum that I find out in the world?  One more update after I drank it it did show that I completed the "drink fresh rum" part, then told me to perform a sneak attack, so I did.  Then it reverted back to "drink fresh rum" again. I'll try again with a found/bought rum and report back.
---
you cant blame the player for exploiting..blame bethesds if anything..you could have the same build as him if yiu wanted to and go around one tapping guys..just pick the right perks,weapon and armor.
---
We do, but the process is rather slow. I am with high fever the last couple of days and bethesda changed once again their file format, so our tools had to be updated to support those changes. We just got the latest custom build for xedit, so we hope to start seeing results.
---
Same still happening to me after patch.  3 star ghoul had 1 pen and that's it.  
---
Yeah, you can select where to put points and the perk cards for your hand independently.   
---
For example, you can add points to strength when you level up but you can then select a card for the Intelligence category.
---
But, if you apply points to a category and you haven‚Äôt selected enough cards for that category, then you will have unused points in that category.  
---
The points still matter.  In your case you can carry more and do more melee damaged because of the points in strength.  It‚Äôs just that your not able to take full advantage of the weight reduction perks until you select more perk cards in the Strength category.  
---
lol most people play solo, I rarely run across teams...
---
ah ok, i thought i was going crazy last night...
---
i will have to check this further, thanks for the heads up, im primarily a farmer (actual farming,like plants and crops) in game so I always have a TON of food/drinks on me
---
i do this as I drink soups as opposed to take stimpaks
---
I just don't like a dude who is at 10% health being able to take four hits till he dies, but one shotting everything.
---
That needs to be balanced in PvP.
---
MissingNo.?
---
Include the spaces? 
---
Level 91 and haven't killed one yet. I've legitimately farmed more TSE weapons (1) then I have encounter a ghoul golfer. 
---
noticed this with raw flux as well, whole bunch had half gone bad before I‚Äôd even left the nuke zone
---
260 hour charlie cooldown for me. 
---
Also had the final boss in AWOL armarments spawn as a Crown enemy, before upgrading itself to a legendary. I killed it slowly, allowing it to Mutate and the loot it dropped was equivalent to what a regular Crown enemy would drop. Its corpse labelled it as a Legendary, but it did not drop a legendary item. 
---
Food seems to spoil at really random rates. 
---
Logging in/out clears all of my well fed/rested/tuned and food buffs on some occasions, regardless of remaining duration.
---
Placing your own land mines and then picking them up again now correctly places them into your current stack. It no longer creates a fresh, unstackable land mine in your inventory.
---
Paper Bag now seems to only spawn AFTER you leave your pipboy. Im not sure what happens if you drop items and ALT F4 the game before leaving your pipboy.
---
Pacifist mode only means you won‚Äôt accidentally engage other people into pvp. They can still attack you and your camp.
---
Thank you!
---
The gatling plasma is a great weapon to use 
---
Can you take down bosses though? What about those flying fellas?
---
We were all warned about using mods/playing with the ini files. Blaming Bethesda for this is pretty silly lol, you tinkered with the file and this is the outcome. 
---
That said, I know a few people who had the issue and after restoring the ini they've been fine. So you've got a way out.
---
That doesn't matter whatsoever.  It makes no difference if you one shot it or empty a full clip into it.   I've tested it several times through westtek and whitesprings 
---
yeah if they just give us the indoor garden trays from FO4 this wont be an issue!
---
My friend has a laser rifle, I cant remember what it is for sure, but I believe it's a bloodied/explosive with the scattershot mod. Even post buffs it still can't unload a full clip before it breaks. When I said they're usable, I didn't mean all of them. Some of them are though, like the gatling plasma and gatling laser. Usable != practical though and just because you can use it in a pinch or save it for certain mobs doesn't mean they're a good primary weapon.
---
I mean, as soon as I walked in the room I got the impression it was a marketing ploy to get us pumped up to buy them when they are released.  
---
Oh, you want massage? We have hot oil massage.
---
Thanks, but I think I'll save those for my 1950's asylum doctor build.
---
Same here 
---
Sounds good man. Looks like we have a squad of 4 maybe 6. That'll be a good grind.
---
He's also a stage-5 clinger. Lewis is gone bud! Move on!
---
/u/Valseek /u/Ladydevann /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ Is it intentional that the new brews do not benefit from Party Boy?

I got the daily today for the Rad Ant Lager and was amazing when I saw the 50 carry weight. I immediately unequipped Party Boy just to make sure I wasn't seeing things. And it stayed 50, then I reequipped it; still 50, then I drank it... And 50. I was really hoping this would benefit from Party Boy given as a Lager it lasts all of 2 minutes as a buff.
---
Nukashine also doesn't benefit from Party Boy or even the Nuka Cola perk.
---
okay?  are the updates stopping today?  are we getting no more new content?  when did this happen?  I thought we had a full year of updates coming?
---
it might not be fair. but you cant blame the player for the type of build his character is. 
---
It's stealing when you get a notice that tells you, "You are stealing." 
---
Ive been wanting some Ultracite paint jobs for a while now but prototype yellow ways not that.
---
Bigger does not mean more detail lmfao.
---
If I have a letter-head sized piece of paper and then I get a posterboard sized paper and both of them are blank I dont say the poster has 16 times the detail as the letter head sized paper. I say the posterboard is bigger like every other same person.
---
It's not out of context because Todd also stated **size** when talking about 76 directly after his 16x the detail statement.
---
That was a poor defense. Honestly all of them you make for this point will be poor because it's a lie.
---
I couldn't get a single quest to complete last night defo bugs
---
I'm worried next time it asks me to relocate! I hope they implement the garden boxes soon.
---
Im on a mission now to see how many times i can get reported for playing the game the way it was made.
---
i saw the plan at flatwoods vendor last night
---
I think it‚Äôs really gonna fuck over people who have devoted many hours and levels into the game. There are people well over 300 and it resets you back to level 1...the benefit of throwing away 300 levels needs to be extremely appealing 
---
... but I loved those jokes!
---
I wonder if when reviewing these claims if Bethesda will suspend or ban the person who reported the incident. In this case, even though one side of the story, if the reporting party presented video and Bethesda saw that the reporting party was the one harassing, will they reprimand that player?
---
Yeah happens to me occasionally but it happened pre update too 
---
I feel bad for the poor folk at Bethesda who have to look through and assess all these reports.
---
Neat! I'll try that! Do you know if it is ANY carpet? Or like specific size ones? 
---
Seconding this. I love the look of the jukebox but this is a little thing that would improve my camp experience a lot.
---
I wasn't being bad to you but I'm super frustrated about having to keep grinding just to fix my fusion generator and water purifiers and I dont even get the chance to take a few caps from the idiots 
---
Damage per shot reduced by 75%
---
I‚Äôve speculated on whether a reactive mod, or reactive plates on PA, are a good counter to bloodied setups. But I‚Äôve never had the gear, or frankly the will, to try it out.
---
Better inventory is broken now, custom.ini need some modification with the patch
---
I can completely under stand this. You know thee would be assholes nuking morgantown and helvetia just to fuck with the updates.
---
Awesome, so basically like the campfire then! Thanks. :)
---
Not disabled. Was able to launch twice this morning. Server crashed before the second one landed though. 
---
Interesting. I‚Äôll try a little more spamming. Heh. 
---
I haven't logged in for a month or two until yesterday's update.   Maybe I'm playing too much also :P
---
Do events! They‚Äôre a great way to earn XP and get supplies 
---
same
---
Killed 6 or 7 scorch beasts last night at Fissure Prime, nothing but shitty guns and organ meat. 
---
&gt;It was the couple of ~~months~~ weeks with no communication that really started to breed the negativity. Great to be back to the honeymoon
---
Fixed that for you. People were extremely negative about the game at launch, and the circle went full jerk when the price dropped for Black Friday.
---
Also noticed this.  Really quick when you log in and out.
---
This is not intended, if you launched a nuke near patch day you have a 300 hour cooldown from your last nuke launch.
---
Players who did not launch a nuke near the patch day can launch them just fine, and only get a 3 hour cooldown. 
---
They do not intentionally disable the nukes, and if they did i would assume they would make an announcement. Further proof is that bethesda devs have been in the comments are asking about the bug, trying to get more information to fix it.
---
Give EVERYTHING!
---
Oh and if you want to make it more aesthetic, buy the ‚Äúresort planter‚Äù plan in whitesprings, it brings an empty pot to build and it can be built over plants, so itll look like your plant is in a plot hiding the rug and look more realistic lol
---
Bullets? it costs me maybe 20 or so. Just a few to keep it angry till it lands, then the beat down begins.
---
Yeah love. That mod
---
I disagree, they know it's one of the things players want the most. The last item on the roadmap "Wastelanders" might deal with newcomers to the region, possibly from the new vault.
---
I woke up on a cliff completely on the other side of the map surround by teddy bears and a skeleton holding an axe. Good times must have been had 
---
It will at least kill them by reflecting back 50% of that massive damage. 
---
Bloodied weapons are in rn bc of the ridiculous damage some can put out but personally I‚Äôm a big fan of the TSE Hardened Combat Shotgun 
---
Im going the other way and becoming the pvper the CareBears want... Until survival
---
"Hi do i have your concent to pvp?"
---
"Hi my buddy is going to claim your workshop. In 10 seconds you and i will be pvp enabled... Get ready!"
---
I used the flows and could get 3 plants on it.
---
events or grind an area in the Forest region for awhile.
---
Guns have range so when someone is melle build taking on the sbq or scorchbeast theycneed higher damage because we tank the damage for gun builds 
---
Im glad we didnt wake up in a temple only to find out im married to a swamp hag...
---
For being lvl 128 you surely have no fucking clue about the game. 
---
Here‚Äôs an example, for 2y olds, so you can understand:
---
A smart kid came and kicked your dumbass and your friends out of your little sandbox. Instead of leaving or ignoring him, you came back over and over, getting your ass kicked again and again. 
---
And now your whining on the internet because you and your friends suck. The end
---
Just found this too: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRP02uM6hIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRP02uM6hIc)
---
The rate at which Laser Rifles/Pistols break is still too high, especially if you have a Two Shot Laser weapon. I know that the Two Shot prefix was changed to make gun condition degrade faster, but on energy weapons it's *way* too much of an increase. Getting a Two Shot energy weapon should make you salivate over the potential damage. Instead it makes the gun unusable unless you can go somewhere and repair after every other encounter.
---
As a suggestion, the Science, Science Expert, and Science Master perks could be modified to reduce the condition decay of energy weapons. Gunsmith does the same for guns and Makeshift Warrior does that for melee weapons, so one for energy weapons would fit.
---
I tried twice last night and it said that both times I was pissed 
---
I have had better luck. Enough that I go eagerly running after them if I see or hear one. I would say every third beast or so has 1 or more plans on it. And as a Carnivore, those foods rock. 
---
Incisor plus an anti-armor melee weapon with an anti-armor mod means your PA might as well be a plastic bag for all the good it's going to do you. 
---
Maybe with the planned underground locations in the Wild West Virginia DLC, as shown in the trailer, maybe this ‚ÄúDeep One‚Äù could be the raid boss just like the SBQ is technically on the surface. Maybe it only gets awoken by nukes, could be a new possibility in the future to nuke certain sites, vault doors or fissures and jump into them to get underground locations.
---
Mate if u need a roof over your head a place to crash i can set u up. 
---
Things like this are all over.  
---
Above the bar in Flatwoods is a bear smoking a cigar gambling with a skeleton.  
---
blueprints are useless for more than that reason, go ahead, try to put down the blueprint you just made in the exact spot you want it, unless you are on the fairway at the Whitesprings Golf Club good friggin luck...
---
I never said anything about editing the engine my man. You dont need to edit the engine to edit the lighting...
---
Right above the Morgantown sign as you enter across the bridge from the direction of the train station. It was such a cool little spot. Not much room, but very atmospheric :)
---
I took the Nukashine left the frat house and the game crashed on the loading screen. When I logged back in it just started me outside of the frat house and I never got to experience the "waking up in a random place" that everyone was so excited about. Boo. 
---
I'm being pessimistic I know. Looking forward to more content, just being impatient. 
---
You're right. Bigger does not mean more detail. But the fallout 76 map is both bigger and detailed. 
---
Oh yeah Melee is OP for sure and yeah people need to learn that there will always be some one better than them.
---
I also would like the ability to fast travel to player vendors on the map.
---
https://drive.google.com/file/d/12AohVwMYveyJXkVYgEdqIEVjgfg4__86/view?usp=drivesdk
---
Idk how that‚Äôs logical but sure lol. They nerf gun builds like crazy because they 1 shot things yet melee is still left untouched. Part of the reason why this games player base does nearly a months after release lol. Besides every other issue, and there were a lot lol. Melee has always been OP. As a matter of a fact most people don‚Äôt even peek into melee and still handle most thing with ease. 
---
You on ps4?
---
Is the player cool down time 3 hours or the particular silo cool down time 3 hours? 
---
Never happened to me before the update. It's so bad though I can't see anything lol
---
Ive seen the gutsys in watagoa several times before. I noticed last night though that legendary protectrons were exploding the second they died instead of a few seconds after. So dont melee kill them.
---
u/valseek
---
That's really cool! I think I'll try that too! I'm trying to build an indoor greenhouse, so that sounds like something that will fit perfectly.
---
Better safe than sorry :) 
---
Maybe it'll have something to do with the cryptids update that's coming. Maybe its a cryptid hunters base and that's where that map with the red lines will be
---
It's a reflex, just like picking up every wrench you see even though you don't need them. LOL
---
It never happened to me before the update. It's so bad though I can't see anything
---
If you wanna grind kills for xp:
---
Grind harpers ferry until you can grind whisprings golf course solo. 
---
Just server hop and use melee. Move your camp right next to where you are grinding. Just die alot. Dont waste consumables. You dont even need to wear/repair armor. 
---
You could hit 50 in less than 10 hours...
---
I crashed a few times right after getting a blueprint I really wanted. Was it related to duping? I have no clue.
---
Is it you!!! Cuz obviously you haven't learned your lesson son. Don't take workshops you can't defend.
---
I'm assuming this is tied to the new "aging" mechanic for the spirits and beers. Has happened to me as well. Food should \*not\* spoil this fast. Even with a maxed out Good With Salt the food still spoils in under 5 minutes.
---
Both.
---
Absolutely!
---
Woah woah woah, what? It took you there? My blackout took me to an unmarked house near the Valley Bridge. That‚Äôs so cool 
---
Then don't attack back and don't take workshops. Simple as that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Anyone else encounter an infinite loading screen while playing on the PS4 post update? I was playing last night and twice, when trying to fast travel, I never exited the loading screen. I was playing with friends and they were able to fast travel easily enough while I sat there on the loading screen. Had to restart the game.
---
Just curious.
---
I'm hoping for something with the c.a.m.p. updates in the coming months. But until then, I guess I won't be moving my camp!
---
Farm the materials needed and craft them with ammo Smith and super duper
---
Depends on your gunü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. My pistol build basically involves me building a crit with my 10mm and then crit with my +50% VATs revolverüòÖ i use around  few bullets doing so - probably 20-30 .44
---
Meanwhile, my buddy used his prime mini gun yesterday and mowed a SB down with a few hundredü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I have a recent video I put up in the settlement sub if you want to see how specifically it looks
---
My method: grab everything not bolted to the ground until I'm over encumbered. Scrap, sell, store, repeat.
---
You're telling me you honestly believe there is more detail in the textures of this game when compared to fallout. I can see the the argument for the same or possibly a little better but it's not 16 factors above what was seen in fallout 4.
---
He didn't say bigger and more detailed. He gave quantitative values to us... not qualitative ones.
---
The game looks outdated graphically when compared to most other developers of similar caliber and the statement about detail was a lie to get you to buy the game.
---

Somebody deserves a raise. Any open positions in this field?? üòâ 
---
I appreciate the response. Thanks! 
---
Really? I wish it had have done that when I was hopping to get strangler blooms earlier.
---
Because there are perk cards that let you avoid damage, you absolute fucking dolt. Serendipity 3 alone lets you dodge attacks 45% of the time if you‚Äôre below 30% Health. You probably didn‚Äôt even ‚Äúhit‚Äù him four times. 
---
Some servers just crash right 
---
Running outdoors i saw some wood pilesüòÉ almost stoped lol
---
Cool! I have that one. I'll be sure to try it out. :) Thank you very much. 
---
Are they tho ?
---
5mm prime ammo still require the same 30 steel/15 lead + powder, ultracite and flux... I don't know about the other.
---
I'll take a look! Thanks!
---
So just don't take fermenting stuff from your stash and it'll be fine?
---
Duped stuff!

Having fun everyday with this game! Come and join us.
---
&gt; below min spec 
---
even a GT650m can run Fallout 4 lol... I mean, not very well, but it runs ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_\/¬Ø 
---
I just want to know how much total weight per tab.
---
50 lbs in aid
---
100 lbs in armor
---
67 lbs in weapons
---
And so on...
---
Somebody I know was making fun of 76 yesterday, and he said "no" when I asked him if he ever played! The insane social media hatred for this game has made so many non-players believe that 76 is a waste of time in spite of its many good qualities. I'll admit the game was released when it was half baked, it probably deserved another 6 months of development, but at least Bethesda hasn't given up on it.
---
I have a full set of unyeilding and +1 strength gear, so with 15 base and radicool thats 40
---
And then make them way way tougher. Give us something HARD to do in the end game.
---
me too! i had to take down a scorch beast right after was doing laps over head when i was reading the label
---
At first his voice scared me, then i realized he was Bender and now i love him.
---
It‚Äôs also hinted that the scorchbeasts are just regular mutated bats that are particularly good at spreading the disease. It‚Äôs all related to Eckhart and his quest to force Defcon 1.
---
Of lol I didnt read the description lol my bad I thought you were asking haha
---
You remind me of a guy I heard about who did something similar way out west in Zion Canyon.  :)
---
That would be Awesome
---
At the very least  I think they should drop ultracite  plans (power armor, prime receivers, etc).   I know, the do it now, but only very very rarely. 
---
I don't understand why this would be a problem.   Ultracite plans dropping from scorched beast require killing  scorch beasts and ten a fair amount of grinding to gather the needed materials to construct whatever the plan is far. 
---
And as far as I know, Ultracite plans   don't  produce anything that is ridiculously OP.
---
What would be the argument against this?  That people will no longer hunt the queen (who never drops the plans you want)? 
---
Soundtrack playing over and over in my head constantly.  I had to turn the radio off in game, not because i dont like.  I actually love the songs but they are taking over my life and now when i get to a location where there is a radio playing the music in game its a nice little surprise. 
---
"....mr. five by five......"
---
yup, non-stop.
---
#BECAUSE OF HIS GODDAMN BUILD HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU HAVE TO BE TOLD NOOB?
---
How do you know what the dailes are?  Every time I go into the Data tab and move through the quests it only has greyed out quests, nothing active.
---
Or do they only activate when you are in a specific location?  
---
Totally agree, hoping they add some good and legit boss fights in the future 
---
Great counterpoint.

Do you have to actually interact with the player to report them or can you do it from the server player list on the server? Cause i can create multiple accounts on xbox, join a server with said multiple accounts and then flag a person all day out of boredom. 
---
how is this not open to abuse for people that are going to go "i dont want to pvp but i want to control this workshop, he killed me so its harassment" 
---
For me, it was happening even before the update. And it's spoiling while I'm offline. By the time I log in, things that were full health the night before are either spoiled or just on the edge of being spoiled. 
---
I should have specified I meant the daily atom challenges not the "daily quests"
---
The flamer should be an optimal weapon in enclosed spaces and buildings but flamethrowers have always had dependable range. Would be great if it had the length of about the throw of a hand grenade. To compensate a greater range, how about being forced to arc the trajectory?
---
You've obviously never played fallout 4 then, as there is an entire quest about becoming the silver shroud and killing bad guys
---
ahh, right, that explains the difference i think. I meant during a nuke. Before the patch a non-nuked WS could get me maybe 8-10 and nuked gives more usually. This time i didn't notice many of the non legendary ghouls dropping items like before.
---
Relic of Argus from WoW was one of my favorite ever items, purely because I let it dictate what I felt like doing on that day and it is truly random. It's effect was the same, randomly teleports you somewhere on base Azeroth. That item only had about a dozen different teleport locations, so here's hoping Nukashine has many many more.
---
never knew there was lead in them tin cans..all those missed opportunities! thanks for this..
---
You need a bigger iron on your hip
---
you are probably right, but I could see them at least adding one in game obtainable per suit. 
---
yeah, i think we just need a more fun way to encounter them, like working our way up a skyscraper or through a cave system before being confronted by a 3* beast! That would be EXCITE
---
This is best advice.  I have more ammo than I know what to do with. 
---
Dammit. I hate to be the noob here. How do you get this to work? Is it the poster you download from the atom shop? I didnt quite understand what that was. 
---
I'd honestly suggest playing the older games and reading things as you play them, FO1 lets you know about the sterile thing, as, if your smart/sciency enough you can actually point this out to The Master, and he realizes his error and pulls a hitler by killing himself in his bunker (and triggering the self destruct sequence)
---
When you favorite frag grenades and throw all of them they disappear from your hot key wheel. But when you pick some more up they are favorited and applied to that same slot. 
---
Power armor should have the same functionality
---
I launched a nuke without any problems this morning. It seems like it‚Äôs only the people who have launched recently who are unable to launch now. I haven‚Äôt launched a nuke in months. 
---
I have noticed often legendary enemies dont heal in FO76, assumed it was a change they made.  You think this is a bug? 
---
I feel like its the vast majority that I have come across now that I think of it...
---
you actually use those shits? do they do anything other than fart all over the place?
---
I killed the final enemy in AWOL Armarments and it spawned in as a Crown enemy, before re-labelling itself as a legendary. I killed it slowly, allowing it to mutate fully, yet it still dropped items as if it was a Crown enemy not a legendary.
---
Mine was like thay b4 the patch... Now its fixed. 
---
Are you using adrenal reaction? Try reapplying a serum.
---
It absolutely is Bethesda‚Äôs job to plan for and test new database features and how they impact one another. ‚ÄúOkay, what happens when you store the fermenter? What happens when your CAMP isn‚Äôt placed?‚Äù These are basic questions for implementing a new system.
---
Legally speaking that‚Äôs harassment, making it a point to follow someone despite their attempts to stay away from you is harassment and may even count as cyber bullying. No means no, if someone wants nothing to do with you then leave them alone.
---
Fuck, i managed to put mine in the garage a little bit further in :(
---
Quick question, why are you carrying weeks worth of junk on you?
---
that looks siiiiiiiiiick
---
I didn't watch the trailer so it was fun with me and another random guy looking around the house for a few minutes and then finally opening it lol (mostly by accident because I always open them xD)
---
I woke up on a gas station roof where the Fertile Soil event was going on. Made it seem like my character passed out there and only woke up when the Farmhand Supervisors started shooting everything lol
---
you mean in front of the console, in the silo, not in front of the silo...
---
It‚Äôs literally a team game lol. Hence the reason you are posting on this market place and making connections with other people. You may play solo as I do, but I have made friends who play and I got them up when I need to shuffle items. The whole point of this game being online for the first time is to make connections and play together. Not alone. Did you even notice the charisma perks that are specific to teams?
---
Why would it be a 'vile practice' to domesticate these new, wild things?  I mean, I could see it argued with deathclaws of the Gray Tribe as they have human intelligence, but why is the act of domestication a 'vile practice'
---
i do this quite a bit.. load in at ws, go to club house window start firing (make noise) with a random weapon all the ghouls run up to window, put on powerfist one punch anything in arms reach of window, go in loot. server jump, repeat. takes 5 minutes maybe, dozen rounds of ammo, get 4-6 random legendaries, jump servers and repeat. character i do this on is 65 i think, been doing this since she was level 50. (just make sure to stick on hazmat suit before ya jump incase ya log into a nuke zone)  
---
my level 220 can has fought up to 4 SBs at once relatively easy fight, no stims used, but alot of ammo shot up into the sky to get em to land, then quite a few rounds put through the handmade to finish em off, not hard fights by any means but takes a bit more time and alot more ammo than ws runs and server hopping. i also farm watoga for legendaries on this character check all robots, ams, and civic center. takes 20-30 min a run checking everything and nets me 4-5 legendary items. in that amount of time my 65 has done 4 ws runs.  
---
so legendaries vs time invested better to do a ws runs than it is anything else at the moment.
---
this was good
---
He‚Äôs right man. I run a completely unmodded vanilla game and I was always able to inspect weapons from vendors. I was not able to inspect items from other players though, so maybe that is what the mod was fixing?
---
I actually checked John DiMaggio‚Äôs wiki to see if he voiced Biv. It really does sound like Bender‚Äôs voice with a slight modulation filter added. 
---
You say you've nodded bethesda games but you somehow think its impossible to edit the lighting via mods.
---
Nexus any BGS title and in the most endorsed section there are various lighting edits. The one is lala land is you mate.
---
This is a great idea. Also sounds like the next plot to another Hangover movie
---
How does one check?
---
What do you mean? U can't server hop to cause respawns?
---
Instigating rifles and 2H weapons for PVE.
---
Bloodied for PVP.
---
I personally enjoy the Gatling laser, I haven‚Äôt played since the newest patch though
---
Plot twist, they added that note in the latest patch. DLCeption.
---
But seriously, awesome find. Now I have to go back and actually read the notes i skipped over.
---
They are not disabled.  People were launching nukes last night in my server.  There is just a cooldown bug affecting some players. 
---
You have ascended, praise be to Atom. 
---
They‚Äôll just look into the guys inventory or something, it‚Äôs saved on their servers 
---
About 14 plastic bowls. Some were stacked in a white locker by the steps of the vault. Some spread about by the open orange trailer/truck. I don't know what it's called vehicle? Then dodge balls in boxes and on the ground. I picked up 5. Left the rest. 3 Stim-packs inside the open orange trailer in a box. You know if you're in the right one since there is a workout bike in it.
---
I guess if you place a camp there. Good way get some plastic, rubber, and health. NOT A LOT but you know. XD 
---
I dunno. I do think people are getting kind of worked up over this. 
---
It‚Äôs simple. Don‚Äôt use offensive language. If your not sure what that is, then don‚Äôt say what you were going to say.
---
Don‚Äôt harass players. If you find yourself in conflict with a player, just move on if you can. It‚Äôs a very big game.
---
Don‚Äôt exploit.
---
This isnt a MMO, its just a survival game with persistant stats/inventory.
---
I never understood bloodied and unyielding. I mean, sure, you get the best damage, but if a Scorchbeast yells in your general direction, you're pretty much done.
---
Somebody launched a nuke while I was at the speakeasy, so no, they aren‚Äôt. 
---
I kinda wanna give it to new players in flatwoods. They will either love it or hate it. I'm gonna warn them it's a pretty powerful drink though aha.
---
Did you try vats
---
Exactly, a total of 5 nukes on 4 different servers and there's no way to get them to re spawn anymore. Tried loading in with multiple characters, on multiple servers, and even have some buddies give it a go. They just don't spawn. 
---
Im taking dodgy off... 
---
Doesnt work well once your geared for PvP or end game 3 star effects... 5/5 Cavaliers does a great job protecting me while i have AP. 
---
a gatling gun for example rips thru my AP from dodgy. Now i can't sprint... Not sprinting is certain death!
---
Nope.  I joined a world last night at the frat house and almost died from rads before I could server hop.  It was an active nuke zone
---
2 words: Tin Cans
---
They scrap for 2 steel / 1 lead each.
---
You get 9 from a can chime.
---
There's 4 can chime here: [https://youtu.be/\_-JxonzgdbE](https://youtu.be/_-JxonzgdbE)
---
Which can be farmed very quickly and easily - over and over.
---
Other good spots at Pleasant Valley Ski Resort and the Eastern Regional Penitentiary.
---
Enjoy!
---
How do you remove doors? Through coding? Did their use to be an entry into other vaults? I thought theyd make it blank behind a door as you just load in, im not to good with game development or anyway so sounds like sorcery
---
They should bring back the settlement beacons from FO4, but instead of attracting setters it would show your C.A.M.P. on the map.  Don't want people to see your C.A.M.P. anymore?  No problem just flip the switch on the beacon and your not broadcasting your location.  It would be easy enough, just a quick asset flip.
---
Your last sentence is probably the explanation. There's another thread on this subreddit saying that one of the previously inaccessible doors doesn't say inaccessible now. I believe it's Dome 7.
---
Mine was a nightmare, woke up in the basement in a house looking right at the large scratching on the walls say ‚ÄúThe sickle man was here‚Äù and piles of skulls and headless bodies. I immediately checked my character in 3rd person to make sure my head was still there and my liver wasn‚Äôt cut out and sold. Thankfully it wasn‚Äôt like getting the lobotomie scar on your head like Old World Blues
---
Or why not build CAMP beside a lead deposit set an extractor and never worry about being the can man again? 
---
 I mean if Bethesda gave me a shopping kart to push around I'd rock some rags muttering and grumbling into my mic ... But that's another story

Well i have the questline done on my alt to recreate the problem, but i need someones base to coordinate with my base to finish the recreation.  We just need to have our bases at the same area, and I can move mine to your plot of land on a separate server than join your server... but atm I need a break as that was more work than I planned to do and bethesda sure as hell isnt paying me as a QA. I will be back later if anyone on PC is wiling to help for 5 minutes.  Would be nice if anyone, especially a dev would help for a moment finish this considering I'm not doing this for fun but to help prove the problem so nobody else ends up locked out of their main account like those already screwed.

damn.  i actually bought them on steam this year, but hated the gameplay.  (i started playing FO3)

Just nuoes and respwns in general?

On the 360 it used to be on your profile, not sure about the new generation though..

Good point, far too tiny to be Cthulhu and they share many similar traits.
---
The lemonade stand is not in a static place. There are several ‚Äúrandom event‚Äù spaces that it can potentially show up at. I ran into it just outside the overseers camp. 
---
Good to know!
---
I see nothing wrong with the SBQ, complete it every few days
---
Build will alter drastically based on pve or pvp. Was strictly speaking towards pve. 
---
&gt;I disagree, it would be too easy to farm them
---
Strange argument to be making, seeing how a trip to white springs will net you 4-6 legendary items in a matter of minutes after easily mowing down a massive horde of ghouls, whereas a protracted fight with a massive, mutated bat will get you scorched beast liver and a pipe rifle. 
---
No worries.  I'm a filthy casual so I don't always know the most efficient way to bang out the quests.  And with some of those new skins from the data mining yesterday, those atoms are gonna spend fast.
---
Thanks for replying!
---
I'll give it a shot on the weekend!
---
yeah sure, have 2 plans left. GT: Exqlus1ve 
---
Wow I posted this 118 days ago. Cheers mate. 
---
That guy says you need all of those on at once for a proper build
---
That is contradicting in itself. Nobody ‚Äúknows‚Äú anything for sure. People just observe something and are convinced, that their assumptions would be true.
---
So how would Bethesda know, whether someone filled a false report intentionally or just was genuinely wrong about his interpretation of whatever he witnessed?
---
My quest for that started at the Charleston Station, there was a poster for it on the bulletin board by the Stashbox 
---
Oh sunofabitch I'm an asshole then. I cruised through a fresh nuke zone solo last night before anyone else arrived and smashed all the glowing ones before finishing my vendor runs. If I had know they wouldn't respawn I wouldn't have.  No one heads to the golf resort for meat piles.  
---
Sounds like they changed the Watoga spawns too. Are they trying to prevent legendary farming?
---
Thanks - that‚Äôs exactly what I do wrt going back to the menu first. It isn‚Äôt a huge deal... just kind of annoying.   ï Õ°¬∞  ñÃØ Õ°¬∞ î

My grandson uses this website and I do not want him to see something as inappropriate as this post. I cannot accept you posting such awful things on the good Christian Internet where innocent children can see them! The Internet should be a safe place for kids to spend their time without adult supervision! I am reporting you to Facebook and contacting my state politicians to inform them that such filth is being posted online, and I hope they will pass some laws to prevent this from happening again. Thank you and God bless you. Facebook please post my comment now I am done talking, thank you. Bob, can you get some Beano at the store? My gas has been acting up and it is really getting out of hand and I don't want to offend the Franklins when they come over for dinner tonight. Oh, and have you tried this voice thing on your phone, dear? It lets you talk into your phone and then it turns it into text so I don't have to push those tiny buttons to write on Facebook anymore. Isn't that great? It's been so hard to type on that damn keyboard. It's so little and my arthritis makes it impossible to use. It's bad enough that I don't understand all the things our little Johnny is posting on his Facebook. What are these me me things? A lot of them are very inappropriate and rude. I think his account was hacked, because our grandson would never post such terrible things, right? He's such a sweet boy. I can't wait to see him graduate from university! That reminds me, remember to pick up a gift for his graduation. Maybe get a bottle of sparkling cider, not champagne since our sweetie bear doesn't drink! He's such a good boy.

[][][] #FORTNITE  Me and my son have always had an up and down relationship. I think this is due to us not really have much in common, its hard for us to bond. He is a huge fortnight fan, and his mother made him a John Wick costume for Halloween (His favorite skin). He was beyond happy. He really loves Fortnight. I took Halloween as an opportunity to bond with him more, so without him knowing I had his mother make me a fortnight costume to surprise him. I scrolled through google looking at different skins and eventually decided to go as what they call "Rust Lord". The outfit seemed easy to put together and it had a bad ass feel to it. I even researched some of the more popular dances (The Floss, Best Mates, and Orange Justice) I spent hours learning these 3 dances, I don't consider myself all that coordinated but after some time I felt I had them down perfectly. Halloween night came and my son went out trick or treating with his friends. As they were out I put on my costume before handing out candy to the kids. I was surprised with the amount of kids that recognized my costume, I was a hit. Until this group of kids, dressed up as skeletons, I guess they are called skull troopers nowadays? I dont know, looked like skeletons to me. Anyway, what seemed to be the leader of the group didn't seem impressed with my costume, he actually seemed bothered. In a demeaning tone before even getting any candy he asked if I could floss. That smirk on his face turned into full blown surprise as I dropped the bowl of candy, and put every bit of energy into the best floss I could muster up. I nailed it. Surprised but still unimpressed the leader said not bad, but lets see your orange justice. I don't know what came over me but I completely blanked, he caught me off guard despite my hours of preparation. I couldn't let this 10 year old alpha me so I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and started flailing around like an inflatable tube man caught in a hurricane. I finished my dance, and silence followed for what seemed to be an eternity. Next thing I know it the group of skeletons erupted into laughter and started jumping left to right while holding their hand in an L shape formation. I was embarrassed, I slammed the door and I kid you not, thought about crying at that very moment. My man hood compromised by a group of young children, but that wasn't even the worst of it. 20 minutes later my doorbell rings, which is strange considering I turned off the porch lights after that embarrassing incident. I turn the light back on, opened the door, and my jaw dropped. a Group of what seemed to be 50+ characters gathered across my lawn all jumping left and right with simultaneously while forming the L shape with their hands. I yelled at the kids, slammed the door and ripped off my costume. What have I done. 30 minutes later my son comes home and I guess word travels quickly in a small community, he already knew what happened. He didn't even make eye contact with me, I tried asking how trick or treating went and he ignored me, went up to his room and slammed the door. He hasn't talked to me since last night and I really don't know what to do.. I don't think he respects me anymore. homer sexual got him  me parents are fuqin nonces they like putting "RULES" on legit everything i wanna get its dumb so for example i buy headphones rules will be put in place for the headphones wanna buy a game they will put rules on that like a couple mins ago i asked for a legit credit card and there like NAH youll have restrictions and im like shut the fuck up youve already put rules on my phone, laptop, most shit i own and i dont even listen to the rules cos there that fucking stupid like one rule for my phone is "dont bring your phone to any place except home and school" like what type of gayass bullshit is that but ofc i dont listen then there like O_O and try to fuck me then i make them realise just how reBarded the rules they make are. Basically, frICK my fortnite....d.as.d.   MOMO MOMO MOMO MOMO MOMO TIDE POD MOMO People have been sending me this! Why??? I'm honestly feeling in danger right now... This makes me feel very unsafe. I'm honestly shaking and crying whilst writing this I can hardly hold myself together please kindly tell anyone who post this without a trigger warning to PLEASE add one to keep their followers safe! I had to take a 30 minute breather after seeing this in my camera roll when posting this before I even typed it. Just... Stay safe...  LIGONDESE lmao $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

[Added this to my Weapons roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aobkwm/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_weapons/), hope you don't mind.

This i can get behind. And what's up with all the locked doors within the resort??! 
---
I'm so sick of getting spammed with the trade emote and then butthurt babies attacking me when I say no. At level 250+ I feel like I have a giant target on my head, like "oh, she must have some cool stuff at that level." Yeah no, that "cool stuff" lives in my stash and comes out only for the Queen, go away.
---
Lucky you! To me (and quite a few of my friends) this happens frequently. If there are a more then 6/7 players fighting the SBQ the server seems to collapse about half way through killing her.
---
Does Graham have nipples?
---
It's you, check your audio settings
---
I bought the Twinkling string lights from the Atom shop quite a while ago. They now project 'Nuka Cola' onto the wall, like that Nuka Cola lamp does in the frat house.
---
Makes my bar look baller, hope it's not fixed ;).
---
Holy fuck how stupid are you?
---
I literally said mods can make the lighting look different, but THEY CANT CHANGE THE WAY LIGHTING IS RENDERED AND HANDLED BY THE ENGINE.
---
You very clearly don't have any idea whatsoever what you're talking about here. Stick to a subject you actually know more about.
---
They‚Äôre great as pvp builds... that said I still don‚Äôt see a reason to have pvp in a game where everyone has an aimbot
---
*Giggles* That was good!
---
We cant build inside
---
What's weird is that sealed jars only give glass even though they have lids.  But if you find the lids by themselves, they give aluminum.  The sealed variants should give both aluminum and glass.
---
Since when does detail literally just mean texture fidelity?
---
C'mon dude, you're out if your league here. Just give it up. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
Anti armor doesn't affect energy weapons, your anti armor Gatling laser is no better than a regular one, at least as far as that effect is concerned
---
My C.A.M.P. kept falling through the ground.    Logging in and out fixed it.    Also putting it on a foundation kept it from happening again.
---
You do if you want to change how it's rendered. Which is literally what we're talking about here.
---
Nothing about dupers saved the game.
---
The others are. For example Prime .308 comes in batches of 86 with Ammosmith so I have a couple Prime LMGs which are my occasionally-used guns.
---
With my 1* Bloodied .50 cal I typically spent 2500-3000 rounds in a SBQ fight. Before patch 7 I changed it to Prime and was spending 1500-2000 rounds. Technically it's more steel efficient but I'm probably going to change that one back since it's my main SBQ weapon.
---
PvE is way too easy imo. 
---
I feel like i could easily remove my perk cards and solo a nuke silo...
---
PvE build? Wood Chucker, green thumb, cannibal, reflect, ghoulish, rad sponge, . Fun stupid perks all the way lol.
---
Yep, gone with the wind, had it there since the beta :‚Äô(

Dude it is the apocalypse, have a drink
---
didnt they nerf that last patch?
---
this is great
---
I ran into so many issues after the update.  
---
Nukes won't launch (260 hour till cooldown bug) tries twice , two different servers. 
---
Character stuck frozen after fast traveling (twice). 
---
Very laggy , hoped through 4 different servers and no help at all.  Internet connection is very good btw . 
---
3 star enemies drop a single "pen" and nothing else.  
---
And killing a scorchbeast respawns another one immediately. 
---
2 buddies and I killed a 3 star legendary albino deathclaw in the cranberry bog area 3 days ago. As soon as it died it was no longer legendary. The body just said albino deathclaw and it didn't give anyone a legendary. We weren't very happy about it.
---
Yeah, i still get my ass kicked. Very rarely. But i still do
---
It worked for awhile post patch but has since been patched it seems. No more 8 corns on a single fire :(
---
They fixed the bug with them and ground purifiers as well(they also can no lomger ve stacked ime). Still carries crafting stations and chairs though. 
---
Point still stands, gatling laser is unimpressive. Especially when compared to stock .50 cal.
---
It's that's the case, then I might need to move my base to find a new resource: salt extractor. /s
---
I also posted here about this. I ended up hitting him and he gave me insult added. I also killed him. http://imgur.com/PhPmt16
---
For me it kept them as blueprints that were placable. Just cant make more.
---
I'd keep to the lower levels for now. Do events that crop up there as they are good for xp etc, explore, whatever. Just work on getting a few more levels under your belt and improving weapons etc.
---
Part of a reason is simply level up so things are easier, but partly because some quest rewards are levelled, so it is better to do the main quests later than sooner. 
---
Video games don‚Äôt fall under Title VII in reference to harassment. Ofher laws or legal standards could apply especially if threats of violence or terroristic comments are made.  But it‚Äôs a game people let‚Äôs keep everything in its proper context. 
---
I watched the trailer and didn't find it until somebody else opened it.
---
I went scorched-earth (no pun intended) and scrubbed everything ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù from my PC. Did a fresh install overnight. The base vanilla game is running without a hitch, just fine. Made an external copy of this (functioning) version for an easy re-install later. Now on to test the mods... 
---
Glad to hear you figured it out! Truly. And well before the end of the event. Good luck out there!
---
Players shouldn't be able to destroy others' camps anyway, is there any reason for it beside for griefing? Getting your camp nuked would be fair game because of the warning
---
I agree
---
Use the search function on the fo76 sub to enter your keywords, you will find hundreds of posts describing the exact issue you are experiencing. 
---
OK so you can't just pick cards you dont have, they obviously have to correspond to your special points, but are you really denying that you can change or alter builds here? When you get to a higher level you'll realise that with a ton of perks from levelling and many, many perk packs, you can drastically change your character. You can set up many different builds on one character. You can take all the cards off and play as new. 
---
hmm, i'll fiddle around a bit. I can hear everybody else fine though. thanks for the reply
---
Id ban the person filing the reports for harassing me, if i was the beth employee
---
Not sure but if you're farming non-nuked ghouls it's pretty trivial to just switch servers and get more spawns. It's more of an issue if you're trying to stay on the same server with friends
---
"WHO NEEDS THEIR ASS PROTECTED?!?"

I want that one pretty bad for my plasma gatling. 
---
After reading the riddle i just searched for the tattoo shop.
---
After my blackout, I woke up inside a drained swimming pool near the water park. I could've drowned.
---
Lmao. Im rolling
---
I don't think it's intentional? We'll see but my current theory is the no-build zone extension just fucked up somehow and now spawns don't work.
---
There‚Äôs a dude on the market sub who does a plan scavenger hunt regularly. Great fun
---
PRAISE MOTHMAN!
---
MAY YOUR PANTS BE EATEN LAST!
---
If any of these items appear in the Atom shop I'm buying without a thought, I have been collecting Nuka Cola stuff almost as rabidly as that dude, I want everything in that room but the light is the best item I've seen yet in the game.
---
Probably you cause I can hear him from upstairs 
---
Ok.  I‚Äôm glad you said you could still build.  I‚Äôve put up with worse.  Thanks for the info!
---
When a couple of your friends keep talking smack to your level being so much higher than theirs.
---
You're acting like nobody has ever tried abusing the report function to try and get someone banned because they couldn't handle getting a beating repeatedly while trying to grief someone. 
---
You know it's true. 
---
It's the Responder Fireman Uniform, which is a super rare quest/event drop. I was really lucky and got it from Thirst Things First, IIRC. There's a matching helmet which I don't have, so I use the Fireman Helmet (the one from Cap'n Kids at the Whitespring) instead. Here's the complete lowdown on the outfit, with Firebreather comparison pics:

AMEN brother
---
Hey. I was nice enough to offer his caps back. I didnt need them.
---
You‚Äôll likely be trading in a number that largely just serves as a status symbol for the opportunity to gain more powerful and useful perk cards.
---
You‚Äôve benefitted from the current system by getting to grab most, if not all, of the current perk cards whilst chopping and changing your SPECIAL points along the way.
---
If you get to keep all of your perk cards, mutations and SPECIAL points, and simply trade in the number that shows how experienced you are for level 1 of Prestige Rank 1 with a new level-up system to work through, how exactly are people going to be fucked over?
---
Is it just a case of ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve put more time into the game than other people but now we‚Äôre being forced to be the same level as them because of the Prestige system‚Äô? Like, have you ever played any other games where you hit a level cap that was then extended with an update and new content?

You get the poster from atom shop but it is available in all train stations I believe. I read the poster and it gave me a misc quest, the location for the quest did not actually appear for me until I got to morgantown though.

Yes but what if we could set up a stand in one of those hand scanner rooms or something??? 
---
Its a pc mod issue right?
---
If only there would be similar interaction/activity/fun in reality. (PC) :/
---
I'm always alone, most low levels run in panic away, no one talks, no one uses instruments. The "wave emote" and/or "heart emote" when I drop stuff are the highest levels of interaction I ever experienced.
---
Drop it in a bag and cycle your pip boy light is PS4 etiquette. The trade UI is clumsy and confusing for new/newish players

They said there gonna be adding no player damage if your in pacifist mode to your camps.
---
I woke up in some unmarked camp along the border of the Mire and the Savage Divide. Looted the place and wandered back to my camp that wasn‚Äôt to far north from there.
---
Never saw that place before, so that was a cool discovery 
---
Me too!
---
No the pure white string lights. They come as solid, blinking, or twinkling versions. Only the twinkling ones show nuka cola .
---
This changes nothing from the previous patch for a legitimate player like myself. You could only get up to about 1600 lbs before the server realized you were overweight and prevented any further items from being picked up. I tried, by dropping more and then doing a "take all".  What this WILL do is prevent players who have 10s of thousands of hundreds of thousands of pounds of duped items from dropping / trading them. These existed on players still because even though the max limit of 1500 was imposed last patch, many dupers still had 10s or hundreds of thousands of pounds on them before the patch, and unless they were banned, they still had access.
---
For reference - I have 2,000-3,000 of every resource (minus flux and acid - I use those up pretty quick), hundreds of legendary armor and weapons, 10-40K of every ammo type, lots of aid items, etc., all on my primary mule. He's at less than 300 weight. This is pretty easy to accomplish through carry weight reduction perks and gear. I just got a -20% weapon weight reduction chest piece that will complete his set of weight reduction gear, and should help even more.
---
Also for reference - I did queen and nuked whitesprings with a full server last night with my alt on the same server and the loot loaded instantly. 
---
That's the idea of a rare drop table. 1 in 10 isnt rare.
---
I found a fix to this bug. I simply just uninstalled the game. Problem solved. Worst game ever.
---
Yeah, this has me wary too. I've been saving my last character slot for Survival.
---
While didnt have that guy work at their bar?
---
Lol. People still play this dumpster fire?

You vending machine will be in your camp, and they would have to add the ability to fast travel to other players camps for it to work the way you want.

---
These are only for melee as I haven't researched ranged as much. If people could tell me the highest damage for each ranged catagory I'll amend my post. These are not considering mods.
---
Best 1H: Combat Knife. It's the fastest speed and highest damage knife. A knife with Vampire can heal for more damage than you take from ghouls, so it's useful for farming and all around.
---
Best 2H: Seems to be Super-sledge, maybe Grognak's Axe. I have a reg sledgehammer that seems to be on par with a super after mods but not sure honestly. Whatever you use, think about Instigating for efficiency. 2 hands, 1 hit.
---
Best UA: Until they fix the bug, Meat Hooks benefit from 1H and UA perks, so consider that. Although you don't have enough room for all of them plus other melee perks, you don't have to max out every card to beat others. After that probably the Deathclaw until they release the new unarmed teased in the trailer. Though I think that's a skin tbh. With Anti Armor effect most unarmed have max armor penetration.
---
Yes, I want op to do his own dirty work. I don't even run this game on pc and I've directed many to the solution.
---
Now that I think about it, I should've searched first.
---
on xbox you just need two consoles and then you load up on a 2nd console with the account that bought the game 1 time(lucky i live in a house with 3 consoles)
---
I read another post that said it had to do with items placed where they shouldn't be. Like the trick where you put the plant on a rug and then move the rug. Do you have anything like that?

I'm on xbox and it's absolutely not in my camp inventory. Nor is some mothman poster people were saying should be there. I had to read one at a train station. 
---
I also bought an item from the atom shop a couple weeks ago that never showed up. The stone vault boy statue. 
---
Lmao barely 24hrs in and already we got toxic player whining and trying to get people banned. Why because they don't know how to play. Get beat and come back for more.

Hey dum dum try blocking player then server hopping next time. The big meanie can't follow you if you do that. I promise they'll be crayons and puppies in your new safe space.
---
You'll be sooo safe from the bloodied weapons there no one will hurt you. And don't bother learning how perks work so you can get gud. Because if you and your friends can't take out a lvl 30 with barely any health on thier player you flat out suck and should go back to minecraft with the rest of the children.
---
At this point I would just rather not have a vending machine than move my camp. Would be nice if they added a mini camp just for vendors.
---
"Hey, you. You're finally awake."
---
What platform are you on? I'm level 35 and new to gaming. I've pretty much been playing with other people (very generous and fun people). Most are higher level than me. If you want to grind ghouls at Whitesprings, there's a trick you can use standing on the wall to stay mostly out of harms way while you tag ghouls. Still need Radaway and probably a visit to the sulphur fountain after to get rid of disease. Still easier to do with others around.

I've had teammates at higher levels take me into WS nuke zone with one sharing lvl 3 radsponge. I followed them around, shot what I could, managed to stay alive lol. They took me through the bog and the mire, took workshops, explored. Got lots of experience with that.
---
I've found that getting lvl 2 Starched Genes at lvl 31 to be great so that I could get Marsupial (which I bought at a really good price from a player) without losing it. I just take the Int hit, which is mitigated by my underarmor and sometimes by a teammate sharing class freak. Marsupial is great because I can jump high on things easily and shoot enemies without them going melee against me. (I also have Grounded and Carnivore since they don't affect any stats I'm worried about.) 
---
If you're open to teaming up, try that. If you're on PS4, you're welcome to join us. I could also take you to the place to start the Enclave quest. I will probably need to have my bloodied melee friend with us to help clear the enemies there though. 
---
remember when you ask for things like turning off what little pvp there is you also have to take decreased workshop outputs due to the lack of threats. things are more connected that you would think
---
&gt;the instruments play differently in every region.
---
Wait what?
---
Better call a whaaaaabulance this one's gone toxic
---
I so want that wallpaper
---
Yeah okay the Mothman sure belongs in fallout.. 
---
Currently, that is the point of it. More drink recipes will do different things and make other builds compatible. Any additional parts to anyone's play style is great. 
---
So at least 3 of you got repeatedly destroyed by a guy in slow moving power armor who needed to get very close to you to inflict damage. Try this next time.
---
Have mics so you can communicate this is a must. Keep your distance remember they have a melee weapon. Do not engage with your own melee weapons circle them with your group and use medium to long range attacks go for the legs it will slow them down to a crawl once the legs are destroyed grenades and mines are your friends just don't blow yourself up.
---
Next time don't cry like a 4 year old about getting owned. I bet you would of got a lot more constructive feedback if you asked for how to defeat someone in a bloodied build or how best to defend against PVP scenarios.
---
I am guessing that you are between 6th-9th grade let this be a lesson that venting to the internet is not very smart if this was Facebook or any other social media platform which uses your name potential colleges and employers could come across old post of yours and this could reflect badly.

If you keep exiting and viewing it the stats will eventually show up

Clearly he isnt Irish, every Irish child knows how OP a wooden spoon is in the hands of Mammy

I have to stop myself from grabbing wind chimes, there are dozens on my block. Also I have a metal fist aid kit and occasionally get the urge to search it.
---
Min-maxing builds. 
---
The drinks you can craft could give a substantial damage boost which is really useful when SBQ lands for example. 
---
ROFLMFAO
---
I stand lately corrected!
---
I have also lost stuff out of my stash as well as off my person. Mostly junk, but still. I had a dude give me 76balistic fiber and 52 adhesive last ni guy t and it's gone this morning . Adhesive isn't  much of a worry, but that much ballistic fiber is a big deal. Please tell me what is going on. Thanks!
---
yes please, had no idea you could build into the ground and would love to know how on XBox
---
I'm emphasizing lighting. Sorry I did not make that apparent earlier.
---
We cannot prove or disprove if the rendering is improved or not. At least not me or you.
---
Lighting on the other hand yes. We can prove if it was improved and if it was something Bethesda "learned" from its modding community for free.99.
---
bethesda should not ban anyone for PVP, even if you grief someone in PVP they should stay out ofit, reason why? you can just jump server and avoid the player....duh? makes no sense reporting someone for killing you multiple times if you cannot be bothered to press the join new server button lol..
---
Yes. When I do this, give stuff to people within trade, I will direct them to the "up for offer" page using my mic. It saves so much time plus I can see what they actually need when in trade and can offer simple advice such as "why are you carrying burnt books?" or "how come you have 50lbs of gunpowder on you?" 
---
Yes it does
---
I know you‚Äôre not accusing him of that, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have the right to tell people what they should and shouldn‚Äôt say. People can say gay if they want to. They aren‚Äôt using it as a slur, they‚Äôre using it as an adjective. Words have alternate meanings. Gay used to mean happy. Did the gays ruin that definition? No, they used the word for a different t meaning. People don‚Äôt have to walk on eggshells to avoid offending people. People need to learn to grow thicker skin and stop getting offended by words. They are words
---
If I see even one less bloodied build because of this I will be happy. 
---
Yes I did last night after the patch. It was awful 
---
He was obviously talking about graphics quality. You know one of the things us gamers like to reference too?
---
For me it was a small brown cardboard box, printer cartridge, sitting on the printer and all I could think of was wonder what mod this is.
---
Brother Nuka's Traveling Salvation Show? :)
---
Holy crap I just noticed this as well. I have them hanging in my home and I went in there today and saw the Nuka Cola projected on the floor and was freaking out trying to figure out where it was coming from. 
---
Are you on PS4 Pro? Cause I have the same issue. I can barely hear him and if I turn the volume up everything else get to high.
---
Wait how can you get legendary effects on the dragon
---
I can hear him chattering from upstairs, but when I go down and talk to him it's the same low volume...but I guess i'm just getting old. thanks for the replies guys. 
---
‚ÄúLearn how to reddit‚Äù -person who spends too much time on reddit.

How about learn how to be a decent human being mate? You aren‚Äôt above anybody here.

Lol. Yeah but I haven't followed you into another subreddit and started harassing you there.
---
True! There are also locked house on the gold course itself as well. Always been a mystery to me. üòè 
---
No, he's talking about detail. 
---
I.e things like area design, items placed in the world, things to discover 
---
My mules are like my favorite thing about the game! Lemme give you the low down on muleing.
---
Some dudes use a fresh out of the vault level 2 mule and just stack them overencumber. This is bitch ass rookie muleing. Don't do it. You only have 960 lbs. The pro way to do it is to play that mule up to level 50 and take all the weight reducing perks on your way up. When you get to level 50, buy your mule a sweet set of unyeilding weapon weight reducing armour. My weapon mule compresses weight so efficiently it's hilarious. A 20 lb fatman becomes 0.2 lbs on my mule. The worst weight compressing weapons are rifles and they drop to just over 1 lb. I have practically unlimited space for weapons. I have a second mule for everything else. Ammo, FDC and armour mostly. This mule isn't as efficent but you can carry a shit ton of ammo and FDC with another unyeilding set that focuses on compressing those weights. 
---
Another huge benefit of mules is that vendor caps reset daily per charachter. I play all 5 accounts (3 fighters, 2 mules) and i can clear 7k per day in vendor caps. They all can craft the union hat, so 100 cloth per day each clears a charachters vendor caps. Takes about 20 minutes per character to do. 
---
You do need a friend to help you transfer stuff. I have 2. A good way to find one is to help a low level player, give them stuff and grind together. If they're decent guys they'll say "let me know if i can ever help you with anything," "well actually, there is something i could use your help with...." 
---
Hmm, actually now that you mention it, I recall the blunderbluss can't spawn with legendary modifiers so the same probably goes for the dragon. The guy referring to his TSE dragon was probably just referring to the black powder rifle. My bad!
---

this is because the campfire was part of the foundation bug that lets you create foundation midair, it was a bug and has been fixed, so anyone wanting castles in the sky made of unbreakable material can kiss it goodbye.

Soon as vendor shops drop I'm starting to vend alcohol. Got 70 razor and 70 corn planted atm.

Best seller is probably going to be red ant lager once its made available.(hopefully tomorrow)
---
You aren‚Äôt really spoiling much. The quest was 15 minutes of nothing lol.
---
Do events that pop up especially if there are other players already there to help you out. great way to get supplies, XP, and discover new locations. 
---
I want the speakeasy door too
---
nope, Xbox. but nice to know i'm not the only one having the issue :)
---
On PS4 but I already tracked the plans down. Thanks though!

You've also not addressed the blatant copy paste from the community's mods into the data mined fo76.

Top post on PerkLoadoutManager describes manual fixes, and the misc files has a new working custom.ini

I tried this last night, i made blueprints with a garden i already had placed, and it wouldnt let me place the blueprint.  Said it needed proper terrain.

My account was suspended for having 35,000 ultracite 5.56 that I traded two legendary weapons for on reddit.  My character was never over weight.  I always say at about 285 pounds with 500 weight in my stash.  No secondary character at all.  They need to let some of us back on our accounts.  
---
This is why I kill SBs: I will have my Ultracite Calibrated Shocks.
---
i'd rather have this as a setting. I like the look of the Jukeboxes more than the radios. 
---
That's about it...... lol
---
Yeah, like less than a half hour of playtime. I went back to my base for razorgrain and corn; by the time i finished making nukashine and got back home all the excess in my inventory had spoiled.
---
I've found that the best locations for high traffic are near a train station seeing as it has a vendor who carries caps. This is a benefit that works both ways for you and your customer. You can log on and visit said vendor, milk him of caps, and take a glance at his current inventory, then go back to your CAMP across the street and do your own thing. People that frequent the area will notice your structure is a player home and probably pay you a visit once they have milked the vendor as well. 
---
Thanks for taking one for the team 
---
April is when the Player Vending is coming. Ammo and Cores will be my specialty. 
---
I agree and the same with the flatwoods monster. If these creatures are going to be very rare they may as well drop rare loot. 
---
Oh yeah you're right, because of the added dmg you spend less ammo.
---
Damn I need a bloodied .50, my TS one is costing me too much missed shots. Not much on a big target like SB/mirelurk queen, but on everything else half the shots are blasting the wall behind the target at 10+meters.
---
I flash my lights(pipboy or PA headlamp) to start with, then if they don't pay attention, i take me 10mm and shoot the bag. Sometimes that still doesn't  work. I guess everyone is scared to death of griefers. In one way, i can't blame them, but in another way they need to trust people a little more. I try to give people stuff all the time, but most low levels run from a level 80+. It sucks that people are scared because of a few bad apples. 
---
If you didn't, you weren't using your settlement to its fullest potential.
---
I logged in today to my maxed out camp being down to 75%, very happy! Actually got to put up my neon lights. 
---
Hmmm, shit, I may be wrong. My Extra hooks modded pole hook does more than my Super Sledge. But I just realized my Pole Hook is over-repaired. 
---
Pretty sure, just go back to him and start talking to him.  I have not been back to him yet after finishing the first quest last night (still at work :/ ).
---
Holy shit that's sexy. Thanks mate !
---
thanks a lot. i tried that already, but i wasnt succesful... i'll give it another try, lets hope. nice video btw
---
All building materials(walls and doors) need to be placed on foundations. Crafting stations, and most other things can be placed on the ground or foundations.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Yes, and less build cost, and you can overlap them. I've got 6 each mutfruit, tatos, and corn on a single piece of floor in one big clump. I just spam "harvest" until I stop seeing new stuff pop into inventory.
---
Lorewise, the X-02 hasn't been made yet by 2102. It was probably developed between Fallout 2 and 3.

In 12 years playing some variation of a Fallout game I've never been more immersed in a world. I'm proud to have gone through the supposed difficult first few months and now I can't wait to explore all the new things this year. Just down the road from Charleston, if you happen to spot a big wooden building with a Mothman sign on the roof feel free to come on in. 
---
Mothman Bar &amp; Grill open for business. Open door policy as well. Tell your friends and brew your own illicit Moonshine. 
---
This happens when you dont stay on the balance beams in the water portion or the balance portion. there are multiple markers visible that i think were made invisible at some point because i only see the button markers now when i redo the quest. 
---
You can still interact with terminals when someone else is already on it. Step aside and click it, it‚Äôll open up your pip

Oh man the anthem sub was jerking each other off on launch.. they mellowed that shit right out once the load screens started hitting them.

The even more bizarre part is carpets used to not work(at least for me they didn't). I had tried it before when I first discovered the firepit glitch.
---
Just opening up my bar tonight, been working on it for quite awhile but with the new patch out I'm hoping more people will be passing through the Mire.

Yes, people still play this dumpster fire as you call it!

That's awesome! Good luck. Tis a hard life.

The game marks a spot on your map with the yellow circle thing. Search inside it.

Or a hub workshop where anyone can place a vending machine down.

Thanks for the feedback :)

It's probably so they can continue using the same trailor for the whole season. Don't knock it, it's just advertising. The road map was released weeks ago and should receive more attention than the trailor anyways since it's all in print right there. 
---
Theres a farm down the street from the tattoo parlor. That with green thumb will give you enough for both.
---
Didn't know that, which makes the even even dumber on their end. 
---
I'd say it's acceptable with 76, as long your not cheating.
---
GIB LEBER ACTION &gt;:(
---
Surprising how many people don't use the hand holding that the game gives you already :)
---
It's the daily quest thing. There is also a lemonade stand random encounter that sells hard lemonade recipe
---
I got it now. I guess it was lagging.
---
No, and there isn't a silencer either. Just thinking about it makes me sad.
---
Knocking down cargobots is the best.  Not quite as good as blowing up cars but still very entertaining. 
---
Can confirm. My razor grain soup spoiled much quicker than it did pre download. 
---
I clipped a legendary 2-star yesterday that only dropped a Drill... 
---
If you literally slap damage me to death, then you're getting reported, and YOU are the asshole, not me.

The game was lagging before the Search Area appeared on map

If you're wanted and hiding in your base, then I'm going to need to make an entrance

Some level 9 tried to PvP me inside the speakeasy. I was level 31. Shot at me a couple of times, then threw a Molotov and got herself killed. Only had a toothbrush on her, though.

People are weird.

You might want to put in a support ticket.
---
What's up with the customizable backpack.  Couldn't find anything but a mention in the trailer. Anyone know anything?  Google just beings me to that canvass bag imbroglio from launch. 
---
You don't need the terminal after the quest is over, do you?
---
I love lamp
---
Yes we definitely need cap increase. The inflation has caught up with the cap limit. Mutation recipes cost 20k and in some trade among players 25k isn't enough.

I drop a bag of goodies in front of them and they run in the opposite direction.  As if the bag is going to explode or I am testing them to pick it up before I kill them.

Thats where i ended up too

The entire area around vault purple is pretty buggy when it comes to camps. The vault itself isnt build protected, and many of the walls dont disallow placement inside somewhere it normally wouldn't.
---
Not doubting you but do you remember where this was said 
---
I actually forgot those recipes do cost 20k Dang yeah 25k cap is annoying and trading has gotten hard
---
Billings Homestead and the farm right next to it just to the north
---
Head towards the Ash Heap, people generally avoid it so the mobs should spawn around your level. Plus it's a great place to explore and gain exp quickly.
---
I dont even bother anymore lol
---
I experienced this on PC, but was able to figure out how to get around it. One other person posted experiencing the same problem on XB1. It might be a potentially legitimate bug.

*Gasps* Oh thank you! Thank you! 
---
Really? You.. you mean it? 
---
Wait for player vending. Unless you have 75k caps and lots of endgame stuff you aren't going to be very lucrative.
---
Really? So to you, slap damaging a pacifist player to death isn't harassment? That's fucking stupid. I'm guessing you're going to get reported frequently.
---
yes. it seems like everything rots faster. I was farming supply to make flux this morning. I did a round of collecting at whitesprings, and it was almost all useless by the time I made it to the workbench inside the resort. Not only the stuff I had just picked, but all meat/viggies too. So bummed. I hope this is a mistake that gets fixed. I assume that this may be a byproduct of them changing the values on nuked flora, and inert flux. Which is also pretty lame imho. 
---
I'll flip if there's a NEIPA recipe. 
---
So much troll salt in this thread. It's going to be a joy to see assholes like you gone forever.
---

---
Ditto, my food always takes a condition hit while I'm offline.
---
I wasn't refuting your point, just stating that anti armor is useless on it. ALL energy weapons were unimpressive before, and the numbers in the patch notes don't seem to change that at all. The durability buff is nice though.
---
I get that it's better advertisement but it's misleading as represented in the article game informer put up. So yes I will knock it. 
---
I love the work you did to achieve this and the writeup was fantastic. I could go on all day about the other games I've muled on but I don't want to bore people. It's quite interesting to see how you got to where you did using this method. Everyone plays the game differently so keep doing your thing I say. üëç 
---
Yep, growing more things now for all that brewing!
---
It's just a troll joking, and you taking it serious like he really means what he is saying is falling for it.  :P
---
Don't feel bad , pvp in this game take as much skill as copying the most meta build on the internet and then aimbotting your ass for 4 digits of damage, your character is probably a normal one that does not orbit around stacking the usual 4 or 5 bullshit damage/defense modifiers avaiable.
---
So moral of the story, either go with the meta or get roflstomped by the same 2 or 3 builds over and over.
---
Or pvp with friends, its a lot of fun when everyone runs off meta builds.
---
Nice! I'm gonna look for a spot on the river between Flatwoods and Grafton, but I'll keep a look out for yours!

Really? My day 2 was ready for pickup this morning. Might be a platform thing(xb)

If you have Radaway on a hot key and use it just as you enter a Nuke Zone you can freeze your game. At least I've done it multiple times...

The X02 is Creation Club stuff, so I am not sure how much of it is actually canon. Although I have heard that Bethesda apparently said that CC content are canon.

Last night my whiskey was Fermenting in about 10 minutes or less in the Fermenter.  I didn't actually time it, but I made half a dozen really fast, and busted out some Grape Mentats.
---
Please stop, you're harassing me.
---
Reported again
---
interesting. 
---
I'm happy to see this as well, it was a rough ride for a few months, but i'm glad people's patience was rewarded and Bethesda can now start working on new content for us.
---
Yes!!!
---
No this person wasn't a troll their tone showed they where serious. 
---
&gt;And it's spoiling while I'm offline. By the time I log in, 
---
Thing spoil by a set amount when you fast travel (or load in)
---
Yeah that pissed me off.  I wasted a good amount of ammo and time for nothing 
---
It happened the other day too when I gave my lvl40 all rise to a lvl39. He was like please don't kill me and I don't have caps. I was like dude. It says its free just take it. Took like 2 minutes of convincing and he was the third I tried to give it to 
---
likely looted it in the speakeasy. 
---
Has anyone tried drinking some when overencumbered? Might be the only way to fast travel and keep your junk
---
Really regretting all that soup I made now.....
---
I assume you could use it to open the door to the supply closet and get more nuclear materials. Have not tried it yet myself.
---
Level 86, and I've managed to kill 4.

Yes please! This is my #1 request to get fixed ! All armor pen perks like stabilized as well as AA legendaries.
---
I already run a Gunsmith, so adding a distillery to my shop just seems like a natural evolution...Because Guns and Booze!
---
Frankly, I much prefer that to the random delay. "It's been ten seconds with no explosion, I must be safe - aaand I'm dead."
---
Makes the nukashine quest harder as its spoils to quick as it won‚Äôt let me harvest new food in the spot indicated.  By the time you go get more it‚Äôs spoiled. 
---
Nope, I think they where just trying to block people from doing the first stage. 
---
No, they were a troll.  Evident by the fact that they were making a "big deal" about alcohol in a game that already had alcohol and is filled with blood, gore, murder, etc.
---
You just fell for it.
---
I love it with people to play with, even randoms...I'm a noob currently
---
Yep. It happens. Playing mmos and modern games I'm used to it.
---
Yup. Fun!
---
I'm surprised you took a chance on buying an expensive game that was advertised as needing playstation plus.
---
Hey you, you're finally awake! 
---
People talk about exotic places they got sent to. Me, i got sent to Flatwoods and the first time and to a cliff near the Charleston station on the next.
---
This is going to make for a rather boring Whitesprings nuke - it‚Äôll be cleared out if 15 minutes and empty.
---
I find it fun, dont come expecting a fallout game ime tho. Much more of a fallout themed survival game.
---
I thought I might be imagining it, but you're right.
---
That sucks, because I pick up various ingredients all over the map to make some of the food/drug recipes. It was already a race against the clock to get everything together before the first thing spoiled. 
---
It‚Äôs very annoying when you‚Äôre making a trade and have to switch to a mule for caps
---
Basically like WOW or World of Warcraft it has the same thing 
---
Why so people could bitch about how they just copied a quest?
---
That's a great spot, lots of traffic. My bar is located in the Mire between Harper's and the Red Rocket. I just made an announcement post last night if you want to check out my build. I'll keep a eye out for yours as well!
---
On PC, I noticed load times have become extremely long ranging from 2 to 5 minutes. Experience this during login and almost every time I fast travel.
---
Yeah been like that since game launch does the same with gatling lasers as well
---
All the negative Redditors moved to Anthem
---
Stayed at the frat house.
---
I have 15+ armor pieces with the sentinel effect. I think by the time you‚Äôre lvl 127 you‚Äôve seen an assasins piece and a sentinel piece and can draw a conclusion as to the existence of Assasins sentinel piece if you haven‚Äôt already encountered one in trades and whatnot. 
---
If this player was lower lvl I‚Äôd understand your point but not lvl 127.
---
I'm eagerly awaiting an answer or even an acknowledgement on the issue. If its an issue with nuking Morgantown, make it a no nuke zone for a few days.
---
my keypad isn't even interactable either...
---
Who knows if ops armor and gun are not left over from the great dupe wipe? He is basically a cheater if that is so. Still hate bethesda for not pulling through and going hard on the exploiters...
---
I was considering coming back to the game with some of these changes, but looks like legendary drops are still wack... i'll hold off until that legendary vendor comes out I guess.
---
Gosh, it's almost like they don't bother to investigate what they publish as fact.
---
I wish I had a wife
---
This is way more than slap damage. You're getting seriously pwnd.
---
This is the entire reason I was looking forward to this update. Sourcing whiskey for grape mentats was tedious.
---
They'll still get worshiped for it is the funniest part 
---
According to Bethesda,via reply they gave, what was done in this video would not be deemed harrassment. But that was my initial fear
---
How is it Bethesda's fault that Game Informer doesn't properly vet the stories they publish? 
---
It's a lot of fun, moreso if you're playing with friends!
---
Love the dutch angle!
---
Have you heard anything about cargo bots going away? 
---
Yeah I wish I have a copy maybe I play with you 
---
I found my offending mod, better inventory.  I hope it's updated soon.
---
ü§£ I was in rush 
---
Wut
---
One of my friends didn't have the cool down last night and we nuked white springs but all other friends had anywhere from 120 he's to 240. I thought it was the silo glitching out at first so I hopped servers and still had the same cooldown
---
Hey u/jivesukka,
---
The plan is for this to be fixed in a future update. As soon as we have the specifics on when that is we will let you know. 
---
I was in a rush ü§£ but do you know where it is?
---
You definitely still take damage if someone uses the right perks and as soon as you‚Äôre staggered you take a lot of damage. It‚Äôs not really broken because there are ways to counter it for sure.
---
here is the recipe for Nuka Cola Syrup [https://i.imgur.com/Shh1rQ9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Shh1rQ9.jpg)
---
But what if you don‚Äôt have any friends 
---
You have an advantage now over casual players, I don't think that is quite fair. These files are unavailable for consoles, as well, so it's almost a different game in comparison. 
---
I figure it's just the game world tapering off as to not encourage people to be hitting up against that invisible wall too much. It does leave them plenty of room to work with though. 
---
But doesn't that make YOU wanted? ü§î
---
Hmm, but all of the ingredients I picked to make Nukashine right after the patch also went bad super fast. We shall see.
---
I prefer a laser weapon myself. It's a cleaner shot, and it leaves that memorable ozone smell after firing.
---
It just increases its fermentation speed. You get plans from a daily from biv.
---
You can do it through the main menu social tab or just by clicking on a players icon on the map 
---
Think of them more as potions, really is what they are. 
---
Better inventory needs to be removed temporarily until they release a new version.  Read their notes for more info.  Also the INI file needs to be adjusted for all mods.
---
On PC, sometimes I experience problems when using a hotkey to switch weapons. 
---
\- Sometimes it doesn't work.   
---
\- Sometimes it looks like I am holding a weapon, but it is not visible.  
---
\- A couple of times I briefly get a weapon that I don't even own. After a second or two, it goes away.
---
Workaround was to use the selector wheel to change weapons.
---
I've drank 3 so far. The first took me to a random camp NW of Berkeley Springs, the second one put me in an unmarked cabin roughly halfway between Mountainside B&amp;B and the golf course, and the third one brought me to that tunnel that runs under the highway near Bog Town.
---
Its what I like to call "The Bethesda Fuck Up‚Ñ¢" (not bashing on Bethesda just kidding lmao)
---
Happy cake day lol
---
I just cleared out every Protectron in Watoga to test this. No Gutsies.
---
The same issue happens with "shotgun" mods on the gatling plasma. Friend has one and it breaks in one mag, even post patch. The issue (we think) is that every particle is taking durability with every shot, so every shot is like 30x durability loss per shot.
---
ever figure this out?  I just installed one and powered it up - cant interact with the pad
---
Where did u find the notes @brotherhood I didn't see it
---
Well, if the ghouls hit me then they do some decent damage! But I can take down a scorched beast in seconds, Whitespring takes me quite a bit longer and lets face it, out of those 4-6 legendaries, you'd be very lucky to get much above a 1\*. Like i said to another poster, what i really want is a little dungeon type thing with a boss at the end, that would be super fun.
---
Did you even read my post lol? this guy was definitely not in pacifist mode, in fact he engaged me. 
---
I posted my concern about this here and got a lot of backlash from people. However Bethesda did reply and stated they review the reports first. It's not automated. I even post a video of a similar scenario as yours. Bethesda said no rules were broken
---
Awesome build! Mine won't come anywhere NEAR this! Very jealous. 
---
It works while overencumbered, but since you have no idea where you'll land it's a bit of a gamble.
---
Damn, alright. I guess I'll just always be mindful of that
---
same for me
---
That‚Äôs your opinion though. Not everyone takes full advantage of what FO76 has to offer. He could be a primarily solo player and just grind off other players nukes and like the PVE aspect. I don‚Äôt agree with that play style but very possible. 
---
The guy is super serious and super salty. I foresee tons of this happening. People were explaining the mechanics and he just wouldn't get it. He was just a lot more vocal than the other run hide and report noobs. 
---
Infinite lol if anything 10k stash limit would be great and 100k cap limit would be amazing 
---
Cause dumb. I am guessing they are used to single player so said "We should let people have names!" but then went "Oh we don't want people to hide who they are, so only account name" and didn't think about how that made the character name pointless. 
---
I watched a video of someone making this. They seemed to like it, definetly worth a try imo.
---
No sadly there arent objective markers. It state only "do a sneak attack" 
---
ahh I see. That would be a nice feature though I feel some people would probably start spamming  one song over and over again. Maybe a radio station run by a robot and when listening to it, a prompt appears allowing all users on the server to vote for the next song playing. I think this idea plus yours would be a good addition to the game somewhere down the line
---
Oh yes, the guy making a big deal in a game about drinking that has had drinking since November of last year is TOTALLY SERIOUS, guys.
---
It's text book trolling.  Simplest, most common version of it to be made.
---
(And you say _I'm_ the one that is not smart?)
---
I doubt it's for the vault raids - they've already announced the two numbered vaults we'll be seeing first and they exist on the map so adding an extra raid vault unannounced would be unlikely. Someone else has pointed out it lines up to a location in the shear terror image so it's probably a part of that. 
---
I think it could be part of the same system they will use to put stuff from your stash on "display" in your CAMP.
---
Would always take a while before cooked meat goes bad in me but yesterday I saw a whole stack of spoiled meat pop up.   Might have to go Carnivore and just stock up on Ionized Meat at this rate.
---
Cool. Thank. I have just finished creating my character. I'll definitely try and do as many as I can.
---
Woke up in a ditch in the Cranberry Bog. It was like a lawn gnome tea party with some skeletons. 
---
THIS. ^^^^
---
1. Find a pretty place to build your camp.
---
2. Wander around [Point Pleasant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothman) and [Flatwoods.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatwoods_monster) They've got interesting things.
---
3. You can never have too much wood or rock if you're building.
---
imgur.com/a/WvNh7mw  
---
I'm not even sure how I got it that high. Full unyielding set, shielded underarmor, radicool, whiskey (with max rank party boy), psychobuff. Still should only come about to 47 or so I think.  
---
Good to know! It was crazy, I just had waves of them coming at me.
---
Bruh are you he lvl 127 I killed lol? what do you mean it‚Äôs not his thing? He engaged me in PvP. By the time you‚Äôre lvl 127 you‚Äôve seen Assasins gear and also sentinels gear. If the player was lower lvl I might understand your point but not with the amount of hours it takes to get to lvl 127.
---
Suits. All Black and Blue and Red.
---
See Grand Exchange in Runescape for a perfect example
---
Not hard to get, but hard to get in huge quantities. I'm personally loving the change. I can go through 2-5K .50 cal rounds in a single SBQ fight. I'd say 2K is really the minimum. So when I craft ammo, I craft 10-20K at a time. That requires a lot of steel. Ironically lead is the much easier component for me, since .50 cal requires a 4:1 ratio of steel:lead.
---
yeah same thing for me dude, pretty annoying especially when hitting the queen. by the time it reloads, she usually is very close to fly away. thats why i switched to a 50 cal. i absolutely love energy weapons, but i had to get rid of it untill they fix it.
---
It reminded me of that one Skyrim quest actually where you bang the gross witch or whatever.
---
Yeah, I just see it as a small challenge.  That area is a good place for a CAMP because you're pretty centrally located to all the major vendors, except the Responders, but Vault 76 itself takes care of that.
---
I had him tend to my weed fields.
---
Yeah wall decor, but mine was hidden under an atom shop suggestion item. I had to select it and scroll over to find the poster. Took me way too long to find it, lol. 
---
So you‚Äôre looking to stroke your own ego here... that‚Äôs basically what you just said in that response with your use of defensive justifications. 
---
You want to feel special... and when someone (rightfully) tells you that you weren‚Äôt the only person to notice this or say something (Because, you weren‚Äôt... people were asking about the change when the game launched... I was one of them), you then act all indignant and butt-hurt.
---
I have made a few things oit of the book the desert salad was amazing
---
Bug does not always occur. I was fermenting and got server bumped and was fine.
---
Very strange, cant say I didnt expect some issues such as this with the new quests though. Took them forever to fix the token turn in by the civil war reenactment.
---
This should hopefully get solved quickly though, as your daily progression might be slowed. And its the only way to get plans for the dlc(I think)
---
Did you try the Vintage Nukashine?
---
&gt; ALL energy weapons were unimpressive before
---
Negative Ghost rider. The gatling plasma is actually quite potent, it's a solid backup gun or special use gun for something like SBQ.
---
Though I do want to say thanks on the anti-armor being useless for energy weapons. I had learned that prior to getting my gatling laser but I also forgot shortly after because I didn't care about energy weapons at the time.
---
Been losing anything not on a foundation when it is relocated. The blueprint missing my arch and fusion generator made me cry. 
---
I mean it's possible and I'm not arguing it, but you people do what I described. I'd love to know how often it happens though. I'd like to think it's rare or varies per game/platform. 
---
Seen this a couple of times.  First time was doing the Enclave quest there and I thought they were attached to that mission, but it seems to be a random occurrence.
---
I had one last week. Just finished mine. Was only getting it for the Nuka Cola paint. Will keep an eye out for a left arm.
---
I did indeed. That's why I was talking about me, not you. EG I play in pacifist mode. If anyone slap damages me to death, then they get reported. You're free to do whatever you do. But that's what I'm doing with the new reporting system. It'll certainly put some griefers out of action.
---
What do you mean by "server bumped"? Did your C.A.M.P. place the next time you logged in? If the C.A.M.P. didn't place did you either remove the alcohol from your stash or wait for the fermentation to finish? These are the conditions for the bug... it won't happen just because you're fermenting or leaving the server.
---
Yeah, probably jas to be nukashine unless you found a new brew. 2 rounds in the fermenter from base craft.
---
I love the LMG but with the fire rate and clip size... you blink and it's gone lol.
---
We got spoiled by F04 I picked up everything I came across.
---
I'm very unlucky to find for the first daily a daily bugged. Thanks for your reply 
---
I‚Äôm pretty bad at Reddit, just downloaded it for this game. I can screenshot the conversation but idk how to post it.
---
I could see them intentionally keeping this one a secret though, after people have glitched into the others, gotta keep something held back for a surprise! 
---
man i thought i was just imagining that...
---
Same issue here. If I forget to check, sometimes I walk into combat and find myself empty handed.
---
Patch notes stated that the issue preventing players from crafting known confederate hats was fixed, however I still can't craft the hat. 
---
:) Exploring is what we were doing. 
---
I think you're right.  I noticed that when putting some beers I made in the fermenter.  It'll be cool to show off some items in the display cases, hopefully.
---
Entirely possible. I figured it was something along those lines as well tbh, but frankly we can't know if that's intended or not. If it is, then it's a bit stupid. If it's not then they don't care or don't know its an issue because it's been a problem with energy weapons since release.
---
Did you read the original post? Game informer is going off the trailer that Bethesda put out that mentions no release dates but instead says PLAY TODAY. I'm not trying to hate, just posting this so people who DO think they have all the content now will be warned. I've already seen a few. 
---
Anything that isn‚Äôt 3 star legendary as anything else just replaces itself 
---
I mean they could have just kept like something bolted over the number on it and over time it would start to fall of leading up to the update
---
Yes but even still it'd be nice to be able to change the name to refelt your current build or role play. I mean heck, you can change your name in real life.... 
---
Food also isn‚Äôt satisfying hunger near as much as before 
---
I 100# agree. Give us planter boxes, and make them big enough to hold say 5 or 6 plants. Since they limit the number of certain things they let you build now, they could limit the number of planter boxes to say 10 or something.
---
Happened to me too.
---
Yeah, I kept reading comments in the thread. I'd like to amend my previous comment to read "no way" in the sense of incredulity rather than as a denial of possibility. People really can be that dumb, it's just weird to see them that adamant about it. Holy crap.
---
I did indeed and i found a bandaid solution, editing post
---
In my experience fast travelling and server hopping speeds that up as well your hunger and thirst.
---
It does. I have used both TS .50 cal and gatling laser. The accuracy and recoil are both noticably worse. Basically, you have more recoil / recoil control issues because you're firing twice as fast. I had a lot of trouble controlling the gat laser, and it's range was quite poor due to the recoil control making it spray all over the place, even when using ADS.
---
The twinkling white lights from the Atom Shop now produce the Nuka-Cola logo in the light, much as the lamp in the new frat house does.  Probably an unintentional overwrite.
---
I've heard reports that the new World Radios volume slider does not apply to jukeboxes, which have had a unique music stream that's a subset of Classical Radio.  The volume slider should apply to those too.
---
Man at that point it sounds less like a game and more like a full time job to me. But to each their own gj getting to where you're at üëç
---
I second this. I would LOVE to see 76 Creation Club content. I think there is just a lot of stigma around it though, so that is probably why they just launched with the Atom Shop. In Fallout 4, you can just make/download free mods, so a lot of people really disliked the Creation Club because they saw it as unnecessary. In 76, however, where mod content is restricted, it makes a lot more sense to have something like Creation Club. However, the only issue I see there is new CC content would have to be distributed to absolutely everyone like the Atom Shop content is, so the paradigm for CC in that respect is a little more unwieldy for 76.
---
A good idea really. Pin would be nice.
---
yeah this bug has been around forever but nobody cared because no one was using energy weapons
---
would be nice to get it fixed now
---
Hey man no problem, I was pretty sad when I found out, had a nice AA Gatling laser early on and realized it wasn't working right. I am eager to try out Gatling plasma again though, it wasn't great but the durability made it useless back when I was messing with it. The damage wasn't doing it for me then but it was no LMG. Lol
---
Seriously.  I was legit hovering on the ‚Äúleave world‚Äù button when three level 170+ players were at my camp.  They jumped to local chat and gushed about my layout and I relaxed a bit but damn if I wasn‚Äôt still on guard.
---
I just quit out of the game and went back in and now they are no longer projecting Nuka-Cola. feelsbadman
---
Thanks!It's easier than you think. Just build for the terrain and I'm sure you can come up with something similar if not better. 
---
Nah this just sounds like a baby version of what most PvP players want, they already said something about if you‚Äôre top 3 on the server in kills people can see your location. You sound like another PvE player that gets mad when I take your workshop and kill you. You‚Äôre literally describing adventure mode and it‚Äôs annoying just stick to PvE bruh.
---
That's because the GMO's have been modified. üòâ
---
No but this was already a problem to me before the patch and it's unfortunate to hear that it's worse now. 
---
I haven't noticed it when fast traveling, but my food does always take a condition hit when I'm offline.
---
Last night I stayed on one server, though, and everything seemed to spoil very quickly.
---
Looks like a C.A.M.P. to me
---
Wasted on nukashine is the intro quest line. To the dailies that you pick up daily from biv for more drink recipes.
---
No, its a camp
---
As it was written in one of the posts, even if you DON'T have any mods installed or never had any, you still might need to add the Fallout76Custom.ini file to \*\\My Games\\Fallout 76 with whatever line there has to be. Try it please and let us know if it worked for you.
---
We really did and the infinite cap limit too 
---
Yea on the loading screen for the new update but not sure the location
---
Blamco Mac and Cheese resulted in a massive pan of food. I gave it a little extra bake in the oven so I got the crispy cheese on top. Spices as given are tasty but not too powerful. Kick it up a notch. The blended carrot thing is strange but it adds that kinda off color for wasteland goodness.
---
I do like 76, yes.
---
In game or IRL? In game it looks real enough. IRL, probably not. As a resident of WV I can tell you that houses here are either really nice or look like they‚Äôre from the slums in Brazil. There‚Äôs no in-between 
---
Shielded for Raider i got myself, i had bought the first levels, treated / resistant. And was doing events. Although i didnt see the drop. i found it in my inventory some time after doing uranium fever, and a couple other events, looking back over my clips i didnt see a drop, which makes me lean to uranium fever because the loot list trailed off. not all items received visibly listed. others have also suspected they received this lining from this event. but the amount i must have done that event and not got it.
---
last time i played shielded Casual Lining was locked behind a bug. i believe the person who stated the bug said it requires queen of the hunt. which at the time was always temperamental for if it was or was nto a daily for me for some reason. good luck 
---
I have to say I clicked on this post with intent to down vote, but I always completely read any post I consider down voting first, and you raise a very good and reasonable point. While it is true that dupers caused issues of their own and need to go away now, they definitely did enable a lot of fun in the mean time before new content began to drop.
---
I remember being at the habitat store, seeing a bunch of alarm clocks and thought I should break those down. 
---
The reason gat laser feels so underwhelming is because it's missing the 45% armor pen from stabilized. Take that perk off and use your .50 cal - you'll be shocked how bad it is. If that perk was working for energy weapons, gatling laser would be reasonable, although I still think I'd use the .50 cal because it's slightly higher dps and has higher damage per shot, meaning it will deal with 300 armor targets like the SBQ better.
---
That sounds to helpful and easy to do (I am sure  it is harder to do then we are thinking but even those who like the game it is more fun to poke fun of it)
---
I got that one yesterday. Turned out to be super mutants.
---
I mean where is the location lol
---
Ha, I remember you guys. Would have followed you to White Springs, but I was out of caps. Stop by anytime!
---
I‚Äôm just saying if I‚Äôve found 15+ pieces of sentinel gear in less time than him then I highly doubt he‚Äôs never encountered one or even a cavaliers piece. I like the PvE aspect too.. that‚Äôs how I got most of my gear so I don‚Äôt see your point?
---
I remember my dad calling someone a behemoth as a kid, but it was just andre the giant. (Super nice guy too!)
---
On PC, he's definitely quiet compared to other NPCs.
---
i only found the one you needed for the quest and already drank that yesterday, are there any more to be found or is there a way to craft them myself?
---

---
I was a little slow on the trigger but next time I won't be.
---
I live in a recreational marijuana state, ive made some buffout tabs that had a bit of a kick too it, the green butter mixed pretty well with the macha. 
---
Dread it, run from it, Destiny still arrives.
---
Ya yeah yeh...
---
But what about the mole miners??
---
I think...
---
Mole miners are... üë∂Babies!!!üë∂
---
Hear me out... They always drop toysüöÄ... I think they were children of the miners. Swathed in miner gear that fused to their soft baby heads. The miners took their babies to the depths of the mine.. Moments before the bombs dropped!
---
No language, stuck in their cute lil miner outfits...
---
Lord of the flies! I want a mole miner boss that acts like a petulant child. Like a toddler that was caring for the infants after the miners took their babies down the mines to shield them from the bombs. Wrapped in miber gear. A toddler king!
---
I considered removing the door panel and replacing it with a wall. Not sure if that would keep them out. 
---
Guess I need to make those next
---
can you still do the foundation stack?
---
You can ferment drinks multiple times? i didnt notice that thanks for the tip
---
I've debated getting it even though I've watched a ton of live streams of it and it's mostly positive feelings I see being voiced about it (except for passing trolls). I'm starting to think the "it's terrible" sentiment is mostly negative hype that sort of steamrolled after a rough beginning. These negative hype events seem to take on a life of their own and many people just go with it. Most of the negative folks I've talked too are just repeating what they've heard and now that it's not popular in general most that i know aren't playing it and that fact alone can hurt the game long term because as we know many gamers don't play games unless friends are. The game's moment in the sun has passed and unless those that are happy with it don't start speaking up things will remain down. And that's a tough thing since the majority of gamers don't say much unless they have support.
---
What Train car is it? Just when i leave the watoga station the train outside with the few steel boxes in it?
---
Could you please inquire about the bug with the grounded mutation's negative effects not being affected by the class freak perk?  My pip boy stats menu says it reduces my damage by 12% but the weapon stats menu shows a 50% reduction with the perk equiped.
---
Seems like we would have gotten an update if this was an intentional delay of nuke launches.
---
Going to be honest, I have a TSE max level and a Bloodied max level .50 cal. The bloodied .50 cal smokes the TSE, but only if I'm sub 20%. Tested with all the same perks / mutations, and I had on demo expert as well. The TSE did slightly less damage in pip boy than the bloodied, but the effective difference due to the bloodied damage being "all one shot" was massive. With TSE you've effectively got what... 4 sources of damage ? 2 bullets and explosions? Bloodied is all one source.
---
This was a lady. 
---
&gt;  you'll be shocked how bad it is.
---
I really wouldn't, I don't need to take the perk off, I just need to shoot while not in PA and I can tell you that the .50 still blows it out of the water 3 fold.
---
Oh nice its repeatable? Wasn't sure if it was tied directly to that particular quest. 
---
It‚Äôs the fertilizer thing under resources, once you‚Äôve read the plan. 
---
Or the sanguine quest in skyrim
---
Will do.
---
Make and ferment a drink. Then wait until it‚Äôs condition bar drops completely. Now it‚Äôs ‚Äòvintage‚Äô. I was wondering this yesterday myself. For instance, compared to regular nukashine, vintage nukashine has the same effects (I think) plus adds 100% increase in unarmed attacks
---
The Nukashine you brew should turn into vintage Nukashine once the condition bar runs down. Not sure yet if the same is true for other brewed drinks.
---
Check later. Ive had stuff disappear and reappear later.
---
It's definately somewhere with trees. You should just walk around until you find trees.
---
Exactly! I‚Äôd spam 1 song sometimes JUST to bait a fight. I‚Äôd stick it on the most annoying/disliked song and wait to see how long someone came to fight me for control. MAKE kids engage in the PvP if they want to hear something different
---
The radio station IS already run by a robot. ‚ÄúTop of the World‚Äù is the radio station... that‚Äôs where Rose is. And ‚Äúvoting for the next song‚Äù would just result in a small handful of the same songs over and over again. Fighting for control over the station is the only acceptable answer. (And with it being called top of the world... something tells me this was the original idea... but too many FO fans have ‚Äúcontrol issues‚Äù)
---
A mutant max lvl gatling gun with sanguinary 3, +30%dmg from perks is clocking at 140 dmg per shot unbuffed on me.
---
Pretty nice.
---
It would be fantastic if they‚Äôd implement it in the way you described. I don‚Äôt know enough about their software architecture to say whether or not it‚Äôs feasible though, obviously. 
---
Thanks.  I've seen the resource in build mode, but can't find the plan.  Need to start spamming workshops
---
Same here? Wtf
---
Only some of the newer ones. Wiskey, bourbon and the others still stop after one to my knowledge. 
---
Nukashine recipe can be found by completing the quest from biv(think its called "wasted on nukashine") 
---
Less than an hour, quite a few loading screens tho.
---
Ya got me. Betheada has been completely transparent about everything all the time and has never misled us regarding fo76. This game shouldn't be doing this bad, the fanboy community was right and this game is just misunderstood.
---
The long series of nerfs did seem to really enhance bullet sponge feel of the game.
---
I think its because more came back on since the new patch. 
---
Me too.
---
yup, just thought I would add a GTA easter egg to a GTA comment...
---
It‚Äôs called brahmin pen I believe, unless it was renamed between me taking a break and yesterday 
---
That would kinda suck. I launched two within about 3 hours of each other (different servers) on xb1. It was my first time so I wanted to see if there was some sort of Cooldown. 
---
I‚Äôm fine with a cooldown, but 150 hours is excessive. Maybe like 5 hours or even 12 hours. 
---
So what? Chicken butt dude. I‚Äôm js I feel bad for the people who have to sort through all these, and I don‚Äôt think they can. There are plenty of instances where people don‚Äôt get responses to their submitted tickets for other things and this false reporting is gonna slow down their ability to respond to things that really matter.
---
Also it‚Äôs like the boy who cried wolf, if everyone reports someone as a duper then the function is useless. 
---
So if this is a good game to you then what constitutes a bad game?
---
I mod my armor with shadowed mods.  I believe you can only mod legs with muffled effects.  It says that it reduces noise while sneaking, so I just go by what I'm reading.  I have no idea if it's better than ultralight.  I put a stabilized mod on at least one arm piece to dramatically improve scoped aim, and a dense mod on my chest plate so that I take minimal damage from my explosive weapon when I'm too close to my target.
---
I'd have to experiment with ultralight mods, but it's difficult to ascertain which is better, because there's no obvious, hard numbers to crunch.  I'd be curious as to what information the devs could provide in terms of the stats and numbers buried in the code.  Stealth seems to have a lot of factors involved.
---
Oh man ive been wanting to try that one too, i was a bit hesitant cause of the carrots but blending totally sounds like i something i should do to hide them from the family.
---
You have mods
---
Agree'd. 
---
On my main character it never showed me on the map or even showed the list in the top right corner. however on my alt it did show up. Might of been cause i had some of the ingredients already? idk
---
Also try a stealth built, and outsmart them. 
---
I want to know about the red ant lager, too. There was a daily challenge for it but I didn't know how to make or find it. Maybe it's something you'll get from a Biv daily quest?
---
A bunch of billboards and signs with Nuka Cola the same style as the mothman/west virginia signs have been datamined so Nuka Cola content is coming for sure.
---
I actually used it as a shortcut through Morgantown, just start sprinting before the buildings could load. I kind of wonder what would have happened if the buildings popped in while I was running through it.
---
He was totally trying to white knight himself. Kids like this need to just stop playing, it's this sort of negativity that prevents me from pvping and raiding myself. I've had my PSN for years and I don't want to tarnish my reputation because some pleb can't get salt out of his eyes. 
---
This is great!
---
"Vault Purple" is now my favorite name for that 
---
In ny experience, the Mole Miner Gauntlet, once you add the third claw, does more raw damage than the Deathclaw Gauntlet does.  I'm not sure if the DCG confers other benefits though.
---
Is the light machine gun going to be usable soon?
---
One that I don't like.
---
Well why didn't you suggest that pre patch...üôÑüôÑ  
---
My main build is VATS shotgun, specifically for PVE. D:
---
I really enjoy doing the workshop radiant defense quests, and now I can't do them without getting bothered.
---
I know people use words for different meanings, but just because someone can use a certain word to mean something doesn't mean they should :) Equating "gay" with "bad," adjective or not, is a slur.
---
In all fairness, I was using a bloodied .50 cal before the buffs. It was one of the best weapons in the game, if not the absolute best for long sustained dps. Now it's just the uncontested best weapon in the game for sustained dps.

This is the place to go if you want a LOT of both ingredients.
---
Mine worked last night and this morning.
---
ü§îMysterious, I will check tonight.
---
That's probably true, but I don't get why they'd want to constantly keep farming caps for a game they don't play.
---
Hey I wasn't calling you out or anything, just thought I'd add a relevant similar quest from a different bethesda game.
---
You do you, playboy.
---
Thought it was just me! I had cooked a few grilled radstags as per usual, and those would have seen me through for a decent time. But I was throwing away spoiled meat and veg like nobody's business after patch.
---
I'd also picked up extra corn etc from the nukashine quest so figured I'd make soup. Nope, most of it spoiled.
---
I'm pretty sure there was something about fixing a bug with mutt chops not spoiling, maybe something to do with that bugged out all food.
---
Whatever, I'm just going to live on dog food till it's fixed!
---
Its simple and clear.
---
I highly doubt that considering I‚Äôve just reinstalled it to a new hard drive, wiped the previous. I may have previously had mods but now I have none, no ini changes, no extra files, the only thing I have is shop items which aren‚Äôt showing there textures
---
Because I don't play the game and keep myself full updated lmfao, happy cake day btw
---
What I've seen from the update so far (3hrs of Gameplay last night);
---
* Server Stability has....Nevermind, Complete Server Crash, Twice last night, and difficulty reconnecting with team (Had to use XBL Dashboard to rejoin friends.
---
* Legendary Enemies Still dropping no legendary items (50% of Ghouls in WS, 30% of Robots in Watoga)
---
* Enemies Dieing when approached, (Ants at Thunder Mt Substation and Appalacian Antiques all suddenly die when approached) no other players in the area.
---
* Empty Containers, everywhere, Mainly Ammo Boxes &amp; Medkits, more than 80% empty.
---
* Much lower than normal amount of enemy spawns, everywhere, even Server hopped twice with no change, and some areas were not spawning any.
---
* Prize Bot Following me, but I could not interact with it, after 10 minutes or so, I just killed it because it kept getting in the way.
---
* Unable to view details of items in trade menu with Vendors.
---
Havent tried a second one yet but the disrciption does say "may cause blackouts", so I imagine it does include the random teleport.. fun but somewhat impractical for serious engagements :p
---
I guess your quest wasn't active? Also the quest does glitch out sometimes. It asked me to read the Nuka Cola Instructions but it wasn't in my inventory, and also Biv wouldn't respond when I activated him. Relogging fixed both issues.
---
Thanks guys !
---
Love your content bro! Yeah I just worry about their ability to sift thru all these reports when people who submitted tickets for other things haven‚Äôt recieved responses after weeks of waiting. 
---
Point taken tho, I think this dude getting #triggered might have triggered me to make a post a little too late last night. I‚Äôve got faith in Bethesda just hate the haters who can‚Äôt stand getting beat lol.
---
Thankfully I wasn't too far from "safety", as I came round in ["The Mire"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaghYDNiDfc)
---
Well... my first sights started lot of time ago when I was injured and forced to be in bed for like 2 months... my sessions were like 14-18 hours per day, for many many consecutive days. At some point, I started having dreams...they were so real. I was running to save me and my family from nuclear explosions. We ended up hiding underground in some caves which are in my IRL town, very deep underground. The blast came... and I woke up. This happened multiple times, even after I got back on my feet after the injury and stopped with those crazy sessions. then I realized I was playing too much. So i switched to New Vegas -\_-
---
I‚Äôm a stealth melee I love watching a tse run around trying to find me 
---
Then, idk 
---
late reply.....the points is you cannot solve them. At the end of decryption you are left with an anagram to solve. You cannot solve the anagram, because the word is obscure. instead people brute force various iterations of the numbers, maybe using any numbers/letters shown in the white-spring bunker.
---
my fear is they make it hard in a place it doesn't need to be hard, and one day those responsible for decrypting nuke codes who currently find the answers move on to other games and any one still left playing FO76 may be struggling to launch a nuke.  And for no reason other than it being made difficult where it doesn't need to be
---
They should add "jobs" you can take over in certain locations that have nothing to do with aqquireing territory/loot but instead just reward you with stuff like atoms so people can earn atoms by rping npcs
---
Ps4 was happening randomly before the patch now I have to equip a second weapon every two minutes otherwise it‚Äôs bare knuckles.

He ate a LOT of beans.
---
When I first got downstairs big was locked in that storage room and I had no idea how to get him out. I managed to talk to him thru the door
---
I do it sometimes to check how different builds work in pvp. Using a stealth build and having chameleon armor. Instigating rifle, all rifle perks equipped.  Can kill someone in one to two shots in sneak mode
---
chad handmade. lul 
---
I like collecting. This setup is great for doing that. Theres really not much to it. I spend 90% of my time playing on my 3 fighters. I just ship stuff over to the mules every few days and clear caps on them when i need to get a bunch together fast for something expensive i wanna buy
---
I just talked to a guy with a 500 hr cool down LOL
---
I just want to put vending machines at workshops, not change anything about them. When survival mode comes out I don‚Äôt see the harm in being able to make your personal camp passive :) 
---
Thanks it's my first!
---
Thanks for the pleasant joking around. 
---
is everyone forgetting they passed out and time passed?  I keep seeing posts about time dilation and food spoiling...  y'all...  you just passed out and woke up somewhere random, time passed...
---
It won‚Äôt tho.. it‚Äôs part of the game mechanics. Until BGS fixes pacifist mode to where you take no damage then people can kill you thru slap damage and if you don‚Äôt like it then leave the server. I get your point but this is another example of abusing the report function, maybe if the follow you to other servers then it‚Äôs considered griefing but not until then imo.
---
Since day one :)

I set a table outside my camp with a vault boy pointing where I drop bags for anyone passing by while I‚Äôm on the server

Apparently purple textures is a default for mods conflicting with a new update. It sounds like you edited files but forgot which all you edited before you moved your game to your hard drive. 
---
Best suggestion at this point is don't use mods. Un install and reinstall. 
---
YOU MONSTER
---
I have the red and white twinkling ones. But they were projecting Nuka Cola. Now they are not. Have you entered Build mode since seeing them project? 
---
yes. that too.
---
I agree and i want to add one thing that there are some instances where there is a reward. When defending a workshop in the mire or the savage divide and you get attacked by 3 scorched beasts one will drop a prime reciever plan. Ive gotten this twice now that it hapoened to me. 
---
That would be awesome if they allowed us to build basements.  Our own little one level underground vaults.  Bethesda, make it so!
---
Play on console 
---
love it!
---
1 in 10 also isn't all, as you stated above. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it goes further.  Once it no longer has a CND bar it‚Äôs done.   The Nukashine has another bar and goes to Vintage.  
---
Ya def a bug. Everyone's cool down is different 
---
Yeah but if we raise the cap to 50k+ (WHICH I WOULD LOve) it would make trading even harder. People will start selling shit at 30k-50k sell 1 item have a max caps. I hate people who do that shit. We‚Äôre playing a game to have fun not be reminded on how the real world works 
---
I have the plain white twinkling. I built more this morning and they worked.
---
The plot thickens. 
---
Thanks.  Love the Reddit name by the way
---
Well, he did say the drink could kill the customers... and didn't seem to mind.
---
I believe it has to do with your character's level (but don't hold me to that).  When I was lower level, I could barely build a 4 x 4 shack.  Now that I'm in my fifties, I'm finally able to make a swanky pad.  Curious to see what happens when I get to triple digits.
---
Yes. Apparently you need the full amount reserved. I read someone else had this problem and when the download actually started it was the correct size. 
---
I opened up a can of crushed tomatoes yesterday.  After rinsing it out, I thought "I should save this for lead.....", then thought "just the jet I guess........stop talking crazy!"
---
Only mods I can remember installing were faster power armour animations, lockpick bar and a enb reshade. Now I‚Äôm also having an issue where all the textures are loading and I‚Äôm falling through the world, I can only swim in water. Man what is going on 
---
You can find dog armor, so dog companion at least should be a thing.
---
Max reduction is 90%
---
Yup. Just logged on to check and all of the food I harvested around 11 pm last night was gone. So minimum 12 hrs to spoil and was only logged on for 1-1.5 after I harvested it.
---
People sell armor sets already at 25-50k and it‚Äôs really good up to 70k it‚Äôs crazy but you‚Äôre paying for good gear I guess so it makes sense 
---
Looks like I need to buy a new NVME drive then. I've been looking to upgrade it anyway.  
---
Seems like an oversight though. Blizzard had this figured out over 13 years ago.   
---
In the meantime, looks like I'll be bringing the lappy to work tomorrow.
---
I hunt them at regular fissure site a couple hours a day, I get plans fairly often. I been at it a few weeks now. I've learned almost every prime receiver and lots of ultracite plans
---
Make a farm at your camp? 
---
I plan on hopping back and forth -- both games offer a unique flavor that I enjoy. 
---
Honestly, the stuff going on with 76 now gives me hope for Anthem in the future. 76's launch was objectively rockier, and if they could put their nose to the grindstone, work out the kinks, and bring out new content that makes players excited again, so can Anthem.
---
Yea. Don't use mods online mate... Experience the game the way its supposed to.
---
On another note, good luck. 
---
If you think prices are bad just wait til the cap is increased. 
---
Bethesda set an artificially high price so that it was difficult to get (it is end game content) and traders could still make caps on recipes found in the wild. 
---
The cap is what is keeping prices in check. Remove that and legendary prices will rise. When all is said and done, there really isn't a lot to spend caps on and the right meta legendaries are still super rare.
---
If you slap damage someone once and they do not respond to you, slapping them a second time *is* harassment. Reporting harassment is exactly what the report function is for. I'm guessing you're a griefer.
---
Ok this is gonna sound dumb. But I think I can only see the Nuka Cola projecting when it is dark outside. I was at my house in the day and even though the lights are inside it didn't show Nuka-Cola. But as I waited and it turned night time now I see it again. 
---
I noticed that too. When I went to the chem workbench I had like 55 spoiled vegetables or something outrageous. 
---
Does cooked food spoil at that rate now too? I always have a ton of glowing fungus/corn soup on hand. It would be a bummer if all that spoiled last night.
---
Just not that much. I could understand 10k for. A really good piece such as a 3 star deathgaulent bloodied. But come on 30k for that ? Most people I see with it doesn‚Äôt even run the build they have it just to have it and I‚Äôm like you don‚Äôt even fucking use it. 
---
I think that may be a random event type of thing. I've definitely had a swarm of Gutsies come after me in Watoga but I was not killing the other bots at the time.
---
Eh, I try to relegate my consoles to either console exclusive titles or streaming for background noise.
---
And to significantly reduce accuracy in terms of VATS. 
---
I'd be impressed too if there weren't all the comma and incomplete sentence problems.  I'll give it an A for effort though.  The semicolon is certainly underutilized in modern writing.  I tend to use it on short sentences sharing the same thought or idea since one reads through a semicolon with less breakup than a period.
---
You're gonna be upset when they make your campsite a no-build zone later this spring due to that new vault.
---
To be fair I've never had SBs drop anything other than garbage loot and meat
---
If you think watching is great, try being the host. Flips my switch hard. :)
---
Nice, I like that idea
---
Looking forward to that shiz
---
I mean that's not what these people are doing.
---
I promise you I don't get mad when I die or people kill me or destroy my camp. The tension is fun, having higher stakes is fun. I'm not a complete casual, I have optimized my build and it is designed for pvp. I can one shot players at a distance, and I will. I'm just saying that I'm also going to be playing the game while I pvp, such as making vendor runs and farming legendaries. I will take your death bag. However, I don't intend on constantly seeking out players to kill. Adventure mode just doesn't have the consequences or difficulty I'm looking for. I'm not sure why this is difficult for you, but I hope to show you if I come to get the several hundred cap reward on your head.
---
I've noticed big time.  I was shocked to have 15 spoiled veggies and meat in my inventory.  I rarely have 1 or 2 during normal game play in the evenings.
---
Very nice, I like how you wrapped around your farm/garden + the gazebo.
---
Ah ok. Thanks. 
---
I was under the impression you could age stuff further
---
Hopefully it includes the option for outfits too
---
Hey man, he's an addict, I'm not about to put him behind a bar with all that temptation. Far better to have him deal with something safe like pot.
---
Sounds like you're gonna need a young priest and an hold priest over in the dev area, stat!

Looks great!

Pay a certain amount of caps to have a spot in a hub. You log out and have to pay to put it back there again or something idk I don‚Äôt make games I just suggest things lol. that would be a good idea for a hub.

SBs aren't really that hard to kill anymore, but they are very annoying, and considering that the are Alpha Enemies in the game, I agree  they should drop substantially better loot than they currently do.
---
I know there is a small chance of them dropping some supposedly Rare plan, but the only thing Rare I have seen is for them to drop a plan at all. 
---
Even the level 10 Grafton Monster by Charleston Train Yard drops better loot than any level 80 SB.
---
I enjoyed taking all the chess pieces 
---
Chess too. All the boards are going to waste. Speaking of board games, any of those cool looking off-brand games would be fun to try. Really just something to place at camp that lets you play a minigame with someone else would be amazing.
---
Okay. What is your IGN so I can look for and accept your invite?
---
This is the only reason i wish I had a PS4, this is great!

Hopefully someone can organize this for PC
---
I had the opposite thing happen, guy takes a workshop from me and kills me in my home with a sniper. When I respawn I fast travel to my other workshop and wait with chameleon. Sure enough, he comes up and tries to take it and i heatshot him with my bloodied gauss, take all his junk and change servers. He then adds me as a friend and i accept, he comes to my camp and tries like 10 times to buy the gauss rifle from me and started shooting me when I said no, lol.
---
I'm no fan of PVP myself, and avoid it for the most part. That being said, I totally get that it's part of the game (that's why there are legendary armor and weapons with PVP-specific benefits, FFS) and I'm assuming risk when taking over a workshop. Only time I've ever been attacked was in a workshop and I got lucky defending myself; I guarantee if he'd returned after my lucky stab through his power armor with my Blade of Bastet I'd have disconnected before he could kill me a second time.
---
I totally agree that if he can't handle getting attacked in a workshop, keeps respawning for more abuse, and thinks that players using advantages deliberately put in the game by the developers is an exploit, he needs to stop playing.
---
Holy fock boys, it's a samsquamtch, must be a 10 footer
---
PC; This is the stuff i experienced since the last update.
---
1. Game becomes "Not Responding" after shooting a mob. No clue how to recreate the bug but it happened twice so far. Never had such issues before this update.
---
2. Placing powered conduits may fail. You select the thing, press E to place it but nothing happens. No sound, no error, literally nothing happens, as if you didn't even press E. Fixable by relogging.
---
3. Attempting to place camp items may give "no item is selected" error, making it impossible to place anything. Fixable by relogging.
---
4. Power armor frames can hold multiple items of the same types. For example you have a frame with raider power armor, unmodded (haven't tried with mods on). You find another raider power armor out in the wild. You can pick up all the pieces from the second PA, place down your 1st PA. When you click raider pa torso to move it into the frame the original one that's already on the PA will be moved to your inventory, clicking the original one that just got moved into your inventory will move it into the PA frame. This way your PA frame will have 2 raider power armor torsos inside it. I don't know if the effects stack.
---
I tried to store a jetpack X01 and a stealthboy X01 torso in the same PA frame but it didn't work. Makes me think it's only working for same type of items.
---
If I put a vendor at a public workshop, and some one else takes over that workshop, who now owns all the things I put in that vendor?
---
I would love to have the greenhouse building pieces added into 76.
---
I'd pay atoms for it
---
I understand. Thank you. Hope you get to feeling better soon.
---
Is there a good tutorial out there for someone wanting to poke around and take a look at the files themselves?
---
Except here it wasn't "SUMMON THE LOOT" but "SUMMON THE BUG FIXES."
---
At the very least, we could do with some Enclave themed X-01 armor. Or, expanded uniforms for the Enclave... I know we have Forest and Urban Recon armors, but some camouflage fatigues like what the BoS have would be nice too. 
---
My point has nothing to do with who likes PVE or PVP lol. My point is simple, you are trying to relate you‚Äôre experiences in the wasteland with his experience by comparing the amount of legendary armor you have acquired at you‚Äôre level. That is an egocentric approach as everyone experiences and plays differently. There is no way of knowing his level of knowledge without asking. Maybe he has 5 pieces of sent/ass himself... but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs put any thought into understanding how the damage calculations are applied. He could be a new player, a younger kid, so many possibilities. Neither of us really know. I think it‚Äôs naive to assume his reaction was malicious, simply because YOU ASSUME he knows about Sent/ass based off YOU‚ÄôRE experience being, ‚ÄúI know what sent/ass is and I‚Äôm a lower level, so he must know.‚Äù We really just don‚Äôt know what his intentions. You could be right or you could be wrong. Keep an open mind cause we don‚Äôt know unless you ask. 
---
Nice,  it is more for static use, so it not disappear with the server hop
---
They should make a spot where everyone can set up like a market that would b soo nice.
---
Some do it to farm caps,  still if u wanna claim a workshop u have to pay caps for it and most players just leave servers anyways. Thats what they wznt, that u keep defending the workshop. So they can shoot u over and over.  Thats why i have a stealth build,  just sneak sit on a good spot with chameleon armor and stealth + rifke perks maxed, and headshot them.  Having an instigating legendary and the sneak perk maxed well kill them in one shot or two. 
---
Yeah! That would have gone total above my head without coming back
---
Woo! Bacon!
---
I have no idea but many of the fixes included with fo76 I hope are implemented into fo4 as well!! There were so many frustrating bugs in Fo4 that have been addressed in fo76. I don't have specific examples off the top of my head, but I hope to return to it one day and experience a whole new game again! üòÅ

You can block players as well, meaning they can't see you on the map, join your server or add you as a friend

My volume of reporting got to the point they actually asked for my phone number and called me directly about 6 weeks ago.
---
No, I don‚Äôt like that. It should function as an auction house and taking someone‚Äôs listing down just because they log out doesn‚Äôt sit well with me, tbh. Although, That‚Äôs no different than your camp despawning when you log off. 
---
Regardless, it shouldn‚Äôt cost you caps every single time you place it down, that‚Äôs a bit much.

Is it just me, or is that a Whitespring bot based on the paint job?

Ha! I've seen this post a thousand times now. They all say they don't have mods or use mods. Ninety nine percent of the time it turns out they do. 
---
Thanks. Not sure why they are using a monolothic system like that. Limitations of the engine or how the game is packaged?

Just found out I had picked up ultracite ammo... I picked up a bag at WS, just rapid punched the Y key and took everything, dumped stuff I didn't need to include ammo since I can;t use it and you also can't sell it, next day banned.

I picked up a couple of level 50 items from a non-nuked Whitesprings Clubhouse run last night (post patch). (PC) 
---
Yes.  I harvested some corn and razorgrain from in front of my camp, opened my pipboy to eat whatever I had left over from the day before, (I don't like to mix up half spoiled soup with fresh soup) and noticed that the corn and razorgrain were already at less than 90% condition when I had literally just picked them.
---
I was harvesting flux in a blast site and 1/3 of it was spoiled by the time I cleaned out the zone.  I didn't have Good With Salt equipped, so I guess that was my bad.  I'm used to flux lasting at least an hour or so, giving me plenty of time to harvest and get back to camp without swapping in perks.

But since you have already asked... I'm assuming you're here looking for folks to game with on Xlive, right?

Im experiencing same issue since yesterday.
---
First of all, I had to move my camp. Ok, I did it, but my building blueprint was not working at all. I tried many many times in all possible ways, it was simply red all the time. I gave up, destroyed the BP and decided to start building all over again from zero. It took me two hrs (i was planning to rebuild it anyways, so it wasn't a big issue).
---
Everything was okay, working decently, just a few server disconnections which I thought were related to the massive amount of players downloading patches, moving camps and so on.
---
This morning  I've been reading messages from a friend, in which he reported me major issues with his main character. He gets disconnected immediately after joining a world. This doesnt happen with his mules.
---
So at lunch break I had 1hr and logged in. Wow. I started to run in major issues too. Getting disconnected multiple times, not as soon as logging in, but after a few minutes. I noticed it happened at least 3-4 times when trying to apply a mod on my gauss at the weapon workbench. As soon as i was scrolling throught he mods, bam, controls blocked and disconnected from server.  So i stopped using the workbench, I wasn't getting disconnected for a bit, then again, without even getting on the workbench.
---
After like 30 minutes or continuous disconnections after a few minutes, I managed to stay in a world for another 30 minutes. Did nothing particular to do that. I don't know what's happening, but please BETHESDA do something because this is a serious problem. I don't have a mule, only my main. I don't want to start again.
---
IMPORTANT: I bought from atom store  the mission map for the brewing, but I never created it in my camp. I didn't even read the poster in stations. So I basically never started anything concerning the brewing DLC missions. I was too busy rebuilding my camp. So I assume is not related to that.
---
Not just bacon, AWESOME bacon. 
---
They stack,  adrenal just got nerfed. 
---
i didnt have to download full game but it took 2.5 hours last night to download..i played FF12ZA during that time
---
Thanks, will credit and add later
---
Thank you. I wanted to do it that way so that it's protected all around it. Plus it's also a center piece to grab the attention of those who come in.
---
last night on PS4 to DL the patch it said it was 20 gigs, i had 70 gigs free on my system, but it wouldnt let me DL it, said i still needed to delete another gig from my system to be able to DL it..
---
so i did, and i now had like 71 gigs free.  THEN the DL could be launched, and it was still only 20 gigs.
---
So.... why did it need 71 gigs free?!?!?!?
---
Yes I was wondering is it safe because later after school I think of doing it but I didn‚Äôt made up my mind and I never gameshare before but my little brother has
---
There is years to come . Not to worry. 
---
Thanks for both those!
---
ROFLCOPTER
---
Touch√©.
---
For guns and bobbleheads its always been like that going back to FO4, I think it has to do with the fact of the rack acting like a container for the weapon instead of making it a static spawn. But I think theyre gonna make it so you can place other things like junk items anywhere too 
---
I've noticed some increased load times, but nowhere near that level on PC.  Are you running FO on an SSD or HDD?
---
Do you have a specific definition from Bethesda?
---
Yup.
---
I don‚Äôt have friends to gameshare Fallout 76 
---
That depends. Are you looking for a serious Xbox relationship? Or, a fling? I'm Xbox but I'm already spoken for. Us Appalachian Xbox'ers are fiercely loyal.
---
A wooden spoon
---
I'm partial to the Monster Mash myself
---
I'm on console and this is happening to me
---
Yes, on PC. If it wasn't for having subtitles turned on, I wouldn't even know he was talking. All my volume settings were turned up. Completely inaudible. 
---
No, adrenal didnt get nerfed.  The damage curve is back to the way it was before Patch 6.  The datafile doesn't lie.  Bloodied didnt get nerfed, either, the damage bonuses are still the same.  They've either changed that they stack at all, or how the damage is calculated.
---
In any event, damage for Bloodied+Adrenal builds has gone down.
---
Shhhhh. ;)
---
‚ÄúHe could be a new player‚Äù... he‚Äôs lvl 127 tho? 
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying but it‚Äôs even more of a reason not to spam that report button if you don‚Äôt fully understand the game. 
---
That‚Äôs like saying a politician shouldn‚Äôt be held to the same standards cause it‚Äôs their first term in office. Ignorance is not innocence and all it would take would be one google search to find this information out. In the time it took him to report me he easily could‚Äôve google searched ‚ÄúOP armor in fallout 76‚Äù and found the answer to his salty question. I don‚Äôt get why you feel the need to baby this guy, again lvl 127.. someone who‚Äôs put countless hours into this game, not some low lvl newb. 
---
i have to check my hunger thirst meter if theres a difference..i alwasys have so much soup on me so i dont even realize if its faster or slower for me
---
I have a couple questions regarding the TNT domes. When I first visited the domes there were 2 domes that were in some way accessible: Domes 2 and 3. Dome 2 was locked, and needed a key, but Dome 3 was unlocked. I was able to go in and grab some Nuka Cola outfits, and plans for power armor paint job.
---
When I returned with the key to Dome 2, I went in and was able to find some alien blaster ammo, and a cryo-tank presumably with an alien inside. However, I couldn't find an alien blaster anywhere. I thought for sure it should be in there. Am I mistaken? Is alien blaster ammo the only thing in that dome?
---
Also, on my second visit, Dome 3 (nuka one) was now locked and required a key. WTF?
---
I am guessing it has to be placed in something‚Äôs inventory like a shelf or case so nobody else can access it or take it from your camp.
---
I am on fallout 76 nearly daily
---
Thank you, I will try again, new to this lol! 
---
You know, you don't need to go to the spot marked on the map. When I need corn &amp; razorgrain, I just go to the Billings Homestead. If you can take the workshop (or someone else has built the brewing workstation), it's even better.
---
But faster spoiling will suck for the next 'Make Mentats' challenge, as I haven't found a place that has all three ingredients (firecap, brain fungus, and carrot flower) in one spot yet.
---
Again WTF??
---
I like to have a friend on Xbox as well but I don‚Äôt like using a microphone I afraid to get bullied 
---
Lots of people reporting cooked food is spoiling significantly faster now.
---
I haven't seen this, I had food from before the patch though, will be checking it against newly cooked food today.
---
I never had that on xbox
---
No don't!
---
the person in question will die instantly to a Watoga Bot explosion!!!
---
JUst a little confused, sorry.
---
Are you worried if that online community is creepy/ full of predators... that sort of thing? For that, I'm going to tell you to do whatever your folks tell you to do... even invite them to sit with you while you play for a while, and let them help you decide if it's for you. This is NOT the question for you a forum full of strangers... leave this to your folks.
---
Twice. I usually forget. I'd really only do it for the shotgun shells and scrappable weapons. The legendary item is rarely good.
---
I mean how would you harass someone in-game that breaks the game rule that isn't a different reportable offense? If following someone and destroying their shit cross server while shit talking them doesn't constitute harassment then what does? 
---
I'm not in game so i havent checked the report options yet, just spitballing here mate no need to downvote.
---
You‚Äôve never been able to do it in player trades but you absolutely could in vendor trades. I‚Äôve done it pretty much daily for the past few months. 
---
Sounds good will be online later tonight will send you a msg.
---
How would the vending machines work anyways? You put stuff in and anywhere you put your  machine it has all the content inside?
---
No y don't. I spent 6h last night rebuilding my camp. Had to replace it 7 because of the limited flexibility of camp building. No fun when all I wanted was to play the new content.
---
yeah me too
---
It happens by just getting in to a fight as well it happens to me every time now since patch 6 I can't even play as it is all it does is makes me mad to play it with it being broken like this getting killed because my quick change weapon is gone and the one I had in my hands was out of ammo 
---
I would too. Having snappable ground tiles that can be planted on would just make life so much easier. Make them cost x material plus fertilizer and water and call it a day. Geeze
---
I usually don‚Äôt have bounties but yeah I‚Äôm on XB1 GT ATXlien. I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick about it I just think your system leaves itself open to abuse and doesn‚Äôt fit the PvP environment. Hopefully you‚Äôre wrong and this won‚Äôt be a feature but I guess we‚Äôll have to wait and see. 
---
The tesla rifle atm is only good for tagging multiple mobs for xp, but ive never seen anyone use it for any type of good damage. Ik the shotgun mod on it may make it do more damage though
---
I'm currently on vacation so my only outlet to fo76 is living bi curiously through everyone else on these subs. Glad I could help. 
---
pre-launch: literally everyone in this sub.
---
post-launch: nah you're the only one left.
---
Very in-depth thank you for that response. I‚Äôll keep trying my main character and see it I can get through , very weird how my secondary is complete fine though. 
---
Ok but I 16 
---
&gt;I'm also wondering if your in a battle, let's say a queen site nuke, would it teleport you out of the fight? Is it always a "blackout" or are there any circumstances that negate the random travel effect?
---
I was still in combat when I blacked out during the quest.  I was actively fighting the party crashers (ghouls).  It just loaded as if I fast travelled and didn't care.
---
I should have added /s at the end...  I know this full well
---
Yeah, I remember reading a note to that effect when I first cleared that place. And on one of the big FO76 conspiracy posts, it seemed to indicate that he maybe has some connection to the cultists or lucky hole mine. I could have read it wrong as the whole thing is complex and confusing.
---
Yeah those wind turbines give me a creep, they sound like from horror movie.
---
Do they plan on addressing this "feature" in any updates? It's unfortunately a red line for me and my gaming group that everyone in the squad has to complete quest goals in order for it to "count". It's asinine busywork that is just unacceptable in 2019.
---
And the nuka door!
---
It would be fun to wake up  with 5 supermutants warlords around you ready to  crush your skull with a sledgehammer.  Or waking up while getting  ' Yeaaaaargghhed' by scorchbeasts
---
I‚Äôm hoping for a broadcast tower that you could turn on and off to let people know where your camp is. 
---
Tested this with a friend yesterday.  Dropped a bag and quit out of the game to switch characters.  The bag persisted.  If only for a short time.  
---
Someone else could probably test this more thoroughly to see how long a bag persists after a player leaves the server.
---
99.9% of the FO76 is good people willing to help others. Don't give on trying to help others.
---
Yeah after thinking about it I agree with you. Mules are lame and only add to server strain. I don't use them and won't be. 
---
I've had same problem for weeks
---
i didn't do that, i actually decide to delete all the minor files from F76 main folder and everything under documents and then do a scan and repair, it worked fine 
---
I guess it would be good thing but what about the new upcoming legendary vendor people may grind and then exploit that who knows I dont know how it will work but I think that's  good idea.

Yeah it still giving me the error message even in flat land. I might just scrap/store it and redo it. Thanks  
---
I wake up on a caravan in the center of Cranberry Bog, the problem is that I'm lvl 27 I have to run for my life, fighting with some mole schorded rat on the way. It was awsome!
---
Xo2 is technically the power armour the enclave wear in fallout 3, so it is canon
---
I was referring to current food stuff.
---
I'll give you $5 and a trip to Benihana if you can make a Scorchbeast Mixed Meat Stew before the spoil rate is fixed. Laaaates.
---
If this isn't a feature, then there is no risk associated with pvp, which I highly doubt will be the case. Unfortunately I'm on ps4
---
I think they accelerated spoilage because fermenting booze uses the same mechanism now, and  they didn't want us to wait a day or so for the drinks to be ready. You know, what could possibly go wrong with such a convenient change, right? :-p
---
This was another event that could've been named alongside Uranium Fever. I've probably done that one 100 times too. Monster Mash is a pain because I have to lower my TV volume and take my headset off
---
No I don‚Äôt do slap damage killing but way to assume things. I‚Äôm js if something is part of the game mechanics then for the most part, it‚Äôs not griefing. You should probably report that lvl 98 death claw that kills you too while you‚Äôre at it... oh wait you can just leave the server.
---
What did your silo holotape say before you ran through? 
---
Installing a switch also works.
---
Can't lol patch notes you cannot even craft ROFL.
---
Yes. My food lasts about an hour now.
---
Three times I have tried each time the game has frozen. 
---
Some are bugged. You need to wait for their loot to load and show up
---
 Yes,  only at the locations for the most part
---
I'm pretty sure you can't be molested through XB Live. Just don't tell them where you live, and don't accept a bus ticket to their house. 
---
Follow those two rules and you should be ok. Probably.
---
It's strange that they are holding back on the nuka cola stuff. It will probably be very popular, i would get it all!  
---
I would love a nuka cola jukebox with chill elevator music, like in the atom shop!
---
Same on PC, I have the voice actor volume turned all the way up and others are fine, but not Biv. 
---
I get that, I want all the content now as well, but if they released it all now there would be nothing new to come, as a fan of GTaO I like how they do quarterly releases with those broken up into weekly chunks, it gives us something to look forward to.
---
He was my favorite part of FO4. Well, maybe a second to that epic Red Death battle.
---
They made a comment about it here.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ax6ll8/bethesda_should_fix_pvp_its_not_fair_to_those_of/
---
I dont think bloodied has been touched at all. Adrenal was nerfed, just not this patch, this patch they fixed the curve that they messed up last patch when they tried to nerf. 
---
I missed that.  Can you bulk?
---
I use it for experience grinding more than for the legendary drops myself. It will be an useful event once legendary vendors are added eventually 
---
You're speculating, I actually have proof.
---
What changes from the datafile do you have to back up your claim that Adrenal was nerfed?
---
I doubt it. I think it's spans racial/sexual/discrimination of "protected" peoples kind of offensive language. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Quick question: Did you use any tricks to get items to go where they normally don't go? Like plants on rugs or campfires? Not saying that's the problem, just trying to figure it out.
---
Your writing makes it difficult to understand your specific points and you really only need a single punctuation symbol at the end of a sentence.  if you have video post it on Bethesda's forum and open a support ticket with them.  Venting here is fine, but a real complaint needs to be coherent and have video evidence or it is quickly forgotten and may be downvoted just because it is annoying to try to read it.  Good luck.
---
Yeah shotgunners who jump around you and cripple you causing the stagger can really do work on an Ass/sent build 
---
I had to as well. 
---
you mean stuff you collected since doing the Nukashine quest?  I mean there def could be a bug, and it could have something to do with the time passing in that quest, time in Beth games is always a bit funny, when you start messing with it you can get some pretty weird bugs, like when they added the cameras to Creation Club for FO4, they had a bug that would mess with time, there could def be a time related bug in this update, I was just reminding people that time passes while you are blacked out...
---
You can craft Nukashine at the brew stations.  Same exact recipe as the quest.  Then you just let it continue to ferment until it turns into Vintage.
---
Hell yes
---
Dome 3 has a key too, someone may have opened it recently on the server you were on that day. :)
---
Also whats the point of *** legendary creatures to spawn if they drop * legendary items and * legendary creatures droppig *** legendary items.
---
The system is so messed up.  And wtf is with the legendary wood armor pieces,  i picked up so many that i could start  building a camp with it. 
---
I hope so, I watched someone open my window and throw an artillery flare in my house the other day. It‚Äôs rather devastating to watch.
---
Dude I not a baby I use the internet before and I know about stranger danger

Ah okay.

The risk is getting killed.. and dropping all your junk and aid items.. and double cap rewards.. there are plenty of risks my dude, I just don‚Äôt understand your reasoning behind what you want but hopefully BGS listens to the real PvPers and makes something fun, not where you get punished for engaging in PvP. 
---
&gt; they tried to fix a bug where certain kinds of meats never spoiled, and they ended up breaking all foods.
---
Maybe it's all working as it's supposed to now, and everything really was supposed to spoil as fast as Raw Flux :)
---
Indeed. I subscribe so I can see all you people beg Bethesda daily for a fun, functional game. Then, I get to watch Bethesda completely fuck up over and over. It's quite hilarious to those of us that escaped this nightmare of a game. 
---
Will you get them all if you buy the plain one? I will probably have to wait a patch to see if it's a bug or a feature.. 
---
Pretty much. People are getting softer and softer. Being offended and seeing what prize you get for being offended is the new fad. Ive been muted for weeks for calling out assholes who then tell on me because they are offended that im mad at them. Best advice is let them go and dont say a word, wait til they go to their camp, and rain orbital strikes on their house. 
---
By nature, you, yourself, can never be an npc. You are an imposter npc. Own it. 
---
What does the organs do for you?
---
Ive heard of a ton of people/posts experimenting with picking up/making thousands of different ammo types and nothing happened.. so not sure if theres other factors involved in them looking into your account in the first place or not
---
The only time I went near there was for rubber. I had tons of excess caps for things like steel and other common materials but it was easier for me just to go get some rubber instead of waiting an hour 
---
Level 149... zero times lol
---
And then after 60 seconds you black out and are teleported somewhere randomly around the map.
---
I think it would be better If we could bring a little upgradeable cart around with a tiny build li.it around it so we could do pop ups and have impromptu farmers markets  and little communities pop up temporarily. I made a post about it and it got viewed like 5 times and made me super sad. 
---
Ok sorry 
---
There will always be nothing but love for Battlestar Galactica, what the eff are you talking about? ;-)
---
One increases luck by 3, one intelligence by 3 and then the other is either end or str can‚Äôt remember.

That's a strange use of your time, but I'm down with diversity.
---
They are looking for someone to gameshare fallout 76 on Xbox with them. Why they are asking if it's safe, and to that op, unless you know them personally I wouldn't trust anyone with my password and I sure as hell wouldn't expect a random person to give me there's so I can get a game that costs 20 euro for free
---
Wasn't serious. :)
---
Talk to people in game, you'll be fine. Worst that can happen is you meet jerk, then just unfriend them.
---
There are so many in this game, it would be pretty neat.
---
So according to that guy there is no limit and you can just keep dropping it by 20%? But some people (like above) say it‚Äôs capped at 90%, does anyone actually know 
---
Thirst and hunger feel accellerated as well. Perhaps they changed something with the in game time?
---
There should be a mod in there that rigs your alien blaster to use energy cells as well, but as far as I know, there's no alien blaster in there.
---
Or you could move to whitespring. It will probably be a good trading hub anyway, with many living there already. 
---
What's your proof they didn't?  
---
Yeah I met jerks in my life they really suck 
---
"Honey?"
---
"What?"
---
"Where's my Power Armor?"
---
"What??"
---
"WHERE. IS. MY. POWER. ARMOR???"
---
I'm literally only saying this one thing... if player 1 is in pacifist mode and player 2 slap damages player 1 more than once or twice--and especially if player 2 slap damages player 1 to death-- then player 2 definitely deserves to be reported. Leaving a server because there's an asshole is like crossing the street to avoid a pitbull. It's easer just to shoot the brute.
---
I think it's just a random spawn. Had this happen one day on log in. I was dead before I could even move. Then a couple days ago I had a horde of scorched spawn near the crashed vertibird. 
---
I got a level 25 instigating shotgun from a 68 ghoul in the bog. I did not look at level, it should have been a great find. I equipped it and wondered why its damage sucked. thats when I noticed the level.
---
The proof is that the bonus damage for Adrenal Reaction is the same as it was pre-Patch 6 based on the values in the datafile.
---
What's your proof that they did?
---
was it a legendary drill?
---
Sorry ok I shouldn‚Äôt have ask 
---
No idea, I'm glad they told me what it was and why I replied back. Looks like a lot of posts had to do with ultracite ammo specifically.   
---
I guess the algorithm they use shows IF you ever had it apparently since I know I dumped it in the hallway at WS along with cannon balls and harpoons.   
---
Not exactly 100,000 or more like they said.   
---
If it was duped stuff then I guess I had duped stuff, just didn't know you get in trouble also for dumping it... like who do you give it to if you find it? WS police? lol  
---
Now all I want is to fill a display case with 20 melee bobbleheads, to strike fear in the hearts of griefers!
---
You should get bone worms. Those little fellas (and gals) will keep you company whatever you're doing.
---
I know it's dmg is laughable, but as understand it, it's a prefix combination that doesn't roll anymore. Wondered if there was a collectors market for it. I've seen them sell over the past weeks for 15k and more. I'm skeptical of posting it without exploring the market on it a bit more.
---
Thank you for your input. I appreciate your time and opinion.
---
P.S. worst part about it is that the bolt doesn't arch with the explosive prefix, RIP.
---
Love this idea, but it has to be owner only permissions in that case.
---
took me a minute to see where you were going with that haha..
---
You can make S/A &amp; C/A gear?  Noooo you cant!
---
Punctuation is your friend. I have no idea what you are trying to say...
---
*"False, If you know what? To do you... Can make? It for 20k!"*
---
Wtf you don‚Äôt even deserve to be debated with a comment like that. I‚Äôve got 3 pit bulls that will lick you to death and ignorance like yours gets these dogs killed for no reason every year, go to hell with that attitude!
---
Pretty sure there is a holotape for this. Cant recall the name right now.
---
theres a rumor class freak doesnt effect the food/water drain of speed demon anymore. 
---
Or 20 explosive bobbleheads to let them know you know their tricks
---
Urban legends usually turn out to be regular stuff. So this is actually cool. Real thing will come after fashnact festival I'm sure
---
And party boy doesn't work with nuka shine
---
Its even worse than that - when I kept driving past wood piles by the side of the road and kept thinking - Gather Wood!
---
nice try.  
---
if they tell you they have to ban themselves.  
---
Is it fun
---
Nuke Silo Holotape or something like that.  You get it for Free from the Enclave quests, and can buy it from the Armory Modus terminals if you need to replace it.
---
I went on a Field Trip earlier this year, and in that field trips there was at one point a big-ass stack of clipboards
---
I had to stop myself from taking all of them and look like a idiot in the process
---
I think they still roll, bethesda ended up editing that inside the vault to say they wouldnt remove it from drops
---
Love that moon mask and reference to the 1902 scifi movie Le Voyage dans la lune!
---
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A DEATHCLAW IN THE ASS, LARRY!

My first wake up I thought it was in Detroit.  Then was like ‚Äúnah too clean, must be toxic valley‚Äù.
---
The cap rewards are the bounty my guy
---
If I remember reading an inside the vault from a while ago my understanding of the player vending was not a vending machine but being able to put prices on items that you can place in your camp. 
---
maybe /u/Valseek /u/LoneVaultWanderer /u/BethesdaGameStudios /u/Ladydevann could look into this?
---
Haven‚Äôt seen anyone do this with ultracite ammo yet and that seems like the only ammo type on the ‚Äúrare‚Äù list
---
I wasnt talking about the one specific example you chose to show us.  They weren't accusing you of harassment; they were accusing you of cheating.  They were clearly approaching you the majority of the times you downed them. 
---
I mean if over the course of a month everytime you log in you're getting reported for harassment the problem isn't all the reports.  Sure, harassment has a broad interpretation.  Outside of something really egregious one isolated incident wont get you punished.  If you're consistantly meeting other players interpretation of harrassment you deserve to get punished.     
---
Disagree. Scorchbeasts are treated like Mirelurk Queens and behemoths. I think scorchbeasts should just drop plans and better loop. No need for legendary status.
---
Nobody tends to care.
---
Get higher energy resist, heavy leather is good for this, get some teammates to aid you as well. If you don‚Äôt have friends (I feel your pain) grab some higherish level randos of the session.
---
Thats incorrect, it will be vending machines, you can actually see the vending machines on both the new loading screen as well as the roadmap!
---
#üòà 
---
To shreds?
---
So another words game informer wrote another half-ass un-researchd article and that's now bethesda's fault?
---
Tin Cans scrap for 2 steel / 1 lead each.
---
Try again, I had this message before.  It cleared once I stopped the game in the Xbox menu.
---
Warning Spoiler! I don‚Äôt think your meant to walk out of the party house, the last bit of the quest in the house is to drink the nukashine and kill the ghouls while your effected by it then you black out from it and are teleported to a random location
---
Ah, I c. My information is about a month old and at that it was a temporary thing because explosive was intended for ballistic weapons and they were figuring it out.thanks for the update &lt;3
---
If you launched the game. 
---
Haha sorry I had to do it.
---
Just an XB server issue. Keep checking back.
---
Mr Prize-Bot is my only friend
---
Dude, no way. I am not gonna live with the guilt of using my All Rise to bash in babies heads.
---
I havent stopped playing since beta.  I do my daily ghoul run and watoga run. Besides that theres is nothing much left to do for me. I did some events but it gets boring after a while.  
---
Like in other games, reporting functions as a way to gather data. When a player reports you, nothing happens. Nothing will ever happen until you get a LOT of reports. At that point your account may get tagged to look at. And a real person will address the situation. They will look at different metadata and see if anything is going on. 
---
Reporting is not some sort of automated banning service. 
---
I wouldn't be so bothered if it wasn't such an unfair fight. I didn't build for a rifle build, so I now have to change it due to unfair mechanics?
---
From what folks have said, it does stack but not by adding. It‚Äôs multiplicative.
---
Thank you for the tips! I appreciate it! Do you know any great places to nuke besides fissure sites? 
---
Have Marsupial for 7k

3 times.  Same as above, when I read it was capped at lvl 40 items, and that it was drawing "instigators"  it became and automatic pass for me.
---
Xbox I bought mine yesterday for 2.5, however, I saw another guy asking 6k. Energy weapons and flamethrowers etc I don't think are dropping with explosive anymore, so it will be a lot more rare.. especially since it wasn't duped heavily like all of the other ballistic guns 
---
I dunno why you are downvoted. You are right. 
---
Probably just caused by random connection issues.  Authentication Failed type messages.
---
Do you have a real job?
---
The first method required an artillery piece and another player. Then after you could do it solo, you would create I believe 300 items which caused you to crash after 5 minutes of the first creation so right before you crash you put the items in a container in the world and go back in the same world to collect the items + the originals would be in your inventory again.
---
Of course they didn't just leave it there because they wanted as many items as possible and as efficient as possible so they stayed in the same server and did it again and again until they were in the thousands. Putting and taking thousands of items in and out of containers in a short period of time caused a lot of server delay and in severe cases, crashes. If you ever even opened a dupers inventory through trade you would see it takes a good 10-30 seconds to load everything. 
---
PC version can be modded similar to fo4 and fo3 but certain aspects were gated off which limits the scope of what modders can do in fo76.  
---
There's even a section of the nexus for fo76 with a handful of mods available.

i think something happened to food/drinks/consumables in this last patch
---
nmy food is spoiling waaaaaaaaaaaay too fast, and last night at a Nuke drop, all the flux i gathered expired within minutes
---
As far as i remember i did the exact same as you, not to say i could be wrong. That said, maybe its 50/50 with the bug.
---
even planters like 4 had would be OK.
---
Yes but you have to realize each 20% reduction is going to be off of the previous 20% reduction. It's not additive. So that means it's not 20%+20%+20%... It's 20%(20%[20%]). 
---
I appreciate the post. Hope you get stickied.
---
I was having an issue with HUD elements missing. Information on my HUD is missing. For example, the level, stats, weight and descriptions would not show. I used Perk Loadout Manager, a PA compass fix, a manual texture for transparent PA HUD, and Better Inventory. 
---
I removed everything, deleted my Fallout76Custom.ini and reinstalled the game.
---
I removed every .ba2 extension. My issue is probably with the texture file that I edited, so I just deleted the corresponding file and did a Scan and Repair to validate. The file was SeventySix - Textures05.ba2
---
~~I am in the process of downloading the respective file, but I don't believe it will help. If that doesn't work, then I will shove everything Fallout76 into the recycle bin and download again.~~ This worked and this issue is gone.
---
Another issue I am having an issue with the title [screen being black and missing names *LOOKUP FAILED!*](https://imgur.com/a/bMYKaq7) in the Atom Shop/Challenges. I edited my Fallout76Custom.ini because things like this have happened before and that was a fix. However, that did not solve the naming issue. I couldn't care less for the black screen, but the LOOKUP FAILED! is preventing me from knowing what challenges to complete.
---
How do you know you fast traveled?  You were so blasted you can't remember.  Maybe you waddled there. :)
---
They have an 11 day cooldown?
---
Workshops are pvp zones not intended for resources, is like mini survival mode you take one and try to hold it as long as you can.
---
Take a deep breath, it‚Äôll be ok! This error happens after server maintenance.. you didn‚Äôt get deleted 
---
Just go to a fissure sight wait for a scorched beast and say hi. They will try to talk back to you with a sonic scream I have no idea what they are screaming about but after you make friends they will follow you so you won't be lonely.
---
Im so glad all you took from this rant was my lack  of grammatical composition !! Thank you for taking the time to look down on me from on high to correct me!! My apologies for offending you with my misplaced punctuation!!!!!! oops to many exclamation points sorry!!!!!!
---
There is a video on youtube of someone being banned bg just passing 5040 ammo between two players as a test on a new account.  https://youtu.be/zzcvTjXEElc
---
200+ times, at this point I do it for the shotgun shells and the hope that I‚Äôll get the rare whitesprings jumpsuit drop or other rare plans. Easy caps and xp too. If lower lvls are there I let them tag everything and do the cleanup with lever action headshots. 
---
I smell salt in the air. 
---
Yeah, I had that installed too
---
Will be on later. GT is warp58. 
---
Dozens of times.  Each time I waddle to the workbench carrying 1000 lbs of extra stuff.
---
Added ! Thanks 
---
So you got an exclusive purple skin for your pip boy and power armor, rock that shit.
---
Had some guy try to challenge or team me at gorge 
---
No response to repeated inquiries about intentions. No mic or txt
---
I didnt know what else to do. Blocked
---
Agreed, it takes me about 3 minutes to kill one of it never lands. It‚Äôs about a minute if it does land
---
Pretty cramped bud!
---
Thanks for the info. I've seen such varying cost on this item I wondered especially with the energy weapon rework. I traded for this early in the game and frankly, I assume it's duped. Certainly not as commonly as the TSE lever or handmade, but I know they were floating around quite a bit for awhile, then dried up. Possibly because there is no market for the weaker gun. Personally have had a lot of fun with my quad tesla, but the explosive doesn't chain between mobs so far far less useful.
---
I had to stop using my Better Inventory mod for this reason.
---
Like when you buy multiple table dances at the strip club... so. Yah.
---
From my understanding you get double cap rewards for killing a player and lose double for being killed. This is different than a bounty where you‚Äôre wanted and are visible to everyone on the map. 
---
I'm not gonna share personal details here. But this doesn't take more time, it's spending the time you have differently.
---
It is balanced... 
---
Use a Vats crit.. Stagger with melee or a  shotgun/gatling gun. 
---
Go invisible with a Stealthboy. Repeat. 
---
Look i just killed an "OP" build in anywhere from 1 to 3 hits. 
---
*YAY*
---
Im embarrassed to say this but ... "Git gud"
---
Thanks man! I do but it was probably me, not autocorrect. 
---
I'll try remember for next time! :) 
---
Did you take the time to research what you were talking about before posting?  Confirm that Party Boy stacks with Nukashine?  (Another poster says it does not).
---
It‚Äôs magic and just empties like a stash? Haha 
---
It would be but a snapping tile piece would be so much more functional.
---
You're absolutely right. 
---
Once.
---
There are more drink recipes in game now?
---
The only new one I have seen is the Nukashine which only give an Agility regen buff which might be semi-useful if of course you dont blank out.
---
Knock knock
---
i feel for you. that sucks. 
---
There were changes to the Assaultron head but no buff to actual damage
---
OMG!!!! WHAT THE HELL!!! Mayday! 
---
That sounds the easiest to me 
---
You've confirmed that your \~Documents/My Games/Fallout 76 folder has no Fallout76Custom.ini?
---
You didn't praise Atom enough
---
Yeah I totally understand that, blocking them is encouraged especially if it makes the game more enjoyable for you. But since they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong really you shouldn‚Äôt report them for anything imo. 
---
sort your holotapes by value, the enclave holotape will be at the top and has all this info
---
Started almost every sentence with "I".   I give you a B-
---
Theres nothing Fallout about Fallout trailers anymore. Were basically borderlands cross rage.
---
F..... For Mr Fuzzy. 
---
Do you remember when nights were so dark you couldn‚Äôt travel without night vision or a bright headlamp? 
---
Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
yup, seemed like the ideal spot. Except for the super mutants that occasionally swim across the pond to attack my walls i can't complain. 
---
With some sacrifice you could maybe just move a tiny camp around :)
---
Selling items at vendor and rather than normal behavior (stays at same place in list) jumps to top of list. Major pain if you‚Äôre selling something starting with R or S (Radaway, Stimpack diluted for example) and suddenly you are back at ‚ÄúA‚Äù again and have to scroll down all the way again to get where you left off.
---
Xbox, not all vendors and not 100 percent of the time, but VERY repeatable. 
---
oh snap! thank you!
---
Noticed that too when I was server hopping and that weight carry buff you get from Ribeye steak wasn't carrying over lol. Just gotta report it.
---
I play solo sometimes and I definitely missed a companion to begin with. But I got used to it. I'd prefer a companion, but I make do with the sounds of the crickets (and occasional screech of a scorchbeast) to keep me company.
---
Would be nice if you could have some kind of companion. 
---
Ever done any troubleshooting? Asking you to update stuff rules the drivers out as a cause which narrows the possible causes. It‚Äôs more helpful than trusting the intuition of people you‚Äôve never met personally to isolate the issue. 
---
  I agree with this concept.  Its not just bullets that encompass the cost of the battle ( I'm speaking about fighting SBs solo).  
---
  Anything you do in the game costs resources.  So a battle with even a low level SB is going to cost repairs to your gun, repairs to your armor, deoending in your level and bulid, along with the level of the SB itself, it can also be a lengthy battle that leaves you comsuming healing materials as well.
---
  Taking all of this into account, I don't believe Im controversial in saying that the rewards in return for the battle are not even close to being worth it.
---
Same!
---
You couldn‚Äôt pay me a million caps to move there haha :) 
---
If you display items in your camp, they wouldn't be available for others to pick up, right? 
---
Even if that interpretation is incorrect? Based on your logic if someone lies on you repeatedly e en though you're not in the wrong you then become guilty? 
---
Oh, that makes sense. I wasn‚Äôt familiar with how it worked in other games (prefer solo gameplay). 
---
In my opinion pvp is broken.  And yeah its not fair.  I dont like losing caps everytime i get killed. Idc if i lose my junk though. If someone challenges u for a fight; most jump around all the time shooting u with a TSE shotgun that mostly kills you in one or two shots.  Armor seems kinda  pointless when it comes to pvp.  Maybe that feature that will give u the possibility to make u legendary when u reach lvl 50 or above  will change it.
---
::long rant deleted::
---
TL;DR: Dupers have ruined this game permanently by permanently off setting item balance.
---
And I remember reading in the Nuke cola tasting room notes about one flavor that included a certain ‚Äòpart two ingredient‚Äô and some of the effects. I also remember finding a bunch of that ‚Äòpart two ingredient‚Äô scattered throughout the facility. Maybe Lewis somehow caught on to that recipe and adapted it to make nukashine. 
---
I love lots of lights and had 3 turrets so there wasn‚Äôt a lot of budget for anything else but I was so thrilled to log in and see I now had 50% of my budget back, thank you Bethesda :)
---
Added you
---
/r/market76
---
Oh yeah I know it‚Äôs not additive of course that‚Äôd be crazy, 20% off 100 is 80 another 20 isn‚Äôt 60 it‚Äôs 64 etc. But aslong as there‚Äôs no cap I can get lower and lower with more Armor that‚Äôs good 
---
My 6x6x5 bunker still stands, just can't make any more modifications to the foundation shell anymore.  At first it was just an experiment on enclosing a base over the industrial water purifiers, but I think I'll keep it now that it can no longer be done.
---
Just to give a scale of this patch...  
---
The whole .esm file contains 4.330.797 records.  
---
Patch v1.1.0.8 contains 290.980 edited records (changes/additions).  
---
Patch v1.0.6.0 contained 628 edited records.
---
Biggest patch until now was v1.0.3.10 with 48.003 edited records.  
---
You can see that this starts to go beyond the scope of a logical monolithic changelog. We are investigating alternatives and how we can process such a vast amount of edited records.
---
Oh I agree about your post.  Griefers don‚Äôt consider the consequences of their actions especially when someone better geared or speccd beats them down.
---
I commend you on schooling kids and wouldn‚Äôt worry about being banned 
---
I‚Äôll try to figure out how to post the link from polar bear igloos video on you tube , I‚Äôm not very post savvy .
---
He gives a note if you hit him. It indicates that the Watoga High Robotics Club made him.
---
Nope that is crafting, cannot eat and drink either. ROFL They might as well delete players chars if they are over. 
---
I'd also request that these items be made for the real-world so I can decorate my man-cave with them.
---
No worries. I‚Äôm playing it mostly solo too. Enjoy your adventure ü§ò
---
Amen.
---
Im sure itll work like how the stash does, where when others look it doesnt show your things
---
I woke up next to the insult bot lolz.
---
I get that, but they're also good for PVE. I wouldn't so bothered if these TSE's didn't appear from nowhere and instagib me.
---
Exactly. If someone downs a nuka shine amd tries to kill you, just run out the clock lol
---
If you buy eso plus all dlc is unlocked free for you, it‚Äôs about ¬£20 on steam for plus...and the content is good.
---
Gt is the same as username here. I‚Äôll probably be within the next 1-1 1/2 hours. 
---
I see your concern in relation to PVP, but not PVE.  I suspect that there will be ways to address this within the PVP-emphasized Survival mode.  
---
I made the Quantum recipe and it was disgustingly sweet lol. Once I cut it down to about half the amount of syrup it tasted pretty good though. The BlamCo Mac and Cheese is pretty great as well.
---
The book is a pretty fun read even if you don't plan on cooking anything. Lots of little lore tidbits and fun details.
---
Oh, that happened later. This one had them actually spawning from the pods instead of Mr. Handys and Protectrons. It was terrifying.
---
It's clearly a bug, but the Twinkling White Lights from the Atom Shop produce the same Nuka-Cola effect.
---
+50%(50%).... Not 50%+50%
---
Grahm Cracker. I made myself gigglesnort
---
The Twinkling Red and White lights also project Nuka Cola on the wall (when the white set of lights is twinkled)
---
Bit steep in price, but I'll keep you in mind if I get no other offers.
---
Is this for all the recipes or just nukashine I‚Äôve been wondering if so then it‚Äôs not really worth the trouble to make them
---
I found out mine still does this morning as well. Turrets are cheap so I just threw one 8 for some power 
---
Added you back are you appearing offline? Having a problem finding you
---
Yea the Red and White hanging lights and the Plain white hanging lights are also projecting Nuka-Cola. I got them in my house already. Not sure if bug or intended. 
---
Walked into my utility room last night and though I heard the sound of a caps stash (fortune finder perk) so I‚Äôm either playing too much, too obsessed with caps or I‚Äôve developed tinnitus lol
---
I never realized there are desk fans in Rainbow Six Siege until I started playing FO76.  
---
I can't hear his dialogue when I'm standing immediately next to him (and crouching, even), on the PS4 Pro. It doesn't help that there's always a couple of people on open mic coughing or creating noise in the immediate area, either.
---
I‚Äôll send u a request then and then you send me a message and lmk when ur free thanks man
---
Never seen mad max eh
---
Lemme nuke those spots
---
Hellfire is not the same as X02, just as X01 is not the same as Enclave power armor.
---
Yea if you buy a set it comes with three variants. Static, Blinking, and Twinkling. 
---
Random but I've been wondering how long nuke zones last. An hour?
---
They should make it where after drinking that you see the small game like squirrels, chickens, and frogs as Deathclaws and Gulpers and you see the Deathclaws and Gulpers as small game.
---
Appears to be just an effect of the Nukashine.
---
Warning:  May Cause Blackouts.
---
I'm confused as to what people are saying here. Are you saying my damage will be higher if i dont use adrenal? lol
---
Wait so day I have stabilized where heavy guns ignore 45% armor and then have an anti armor weapon are you saying it does 2250? That doesn‚Äôt make sense to do that, but if they do stack by just adding it would be 95%. The only reason I ask is because perks that change run speed do not stack.
---
I ate til I had a full food meter last night. Fast traveled and the meter was completely empty. Food was gone. Just another in the long line of the sad saga that is BGS
---
Yeah i agree to the pvp part of it. but a power armour melee build takes alot of damage from beasts especially hordes of them. While in a team the gun build can just stand back and get shots off without needing to take any damage.
---
Instigating is king of PVE solo but is awful for groups or the queen. 
---
That would be an amazing easter egg! Just the intro screen for 20 seconds then back to the FO76 world.
---
More like "Are you gonna buy something Smoothskin, or just stare?"
---
Wow! Great Public Service Announcement that helps us all! You didn‚Äôt even say what system you‚Äôre on and a quick google search leads you to other subreddits used for trading 
---
&gt;Do I have to manually scrap my junk into building materials or will just transferring it to my C.A.M.P. suffice?
---
Yes, you scrap it at a crafting bench and then store it in your stash. However, there is a "scrap all junk" option at the benches which make the process take literally 5 seconds from scrapping to storing.
---
&gt;Second, I was wondering if I can solo the game all the way?
---
I did, up until the SBQ fight
---
&gt;Any tips for a low level player in general?
---
Grind the forest for a while before slowly moving north and west.
---
Don't know, next played those. 
---
How does it make sense to ignore more than 100% armor?
---
Yep. I noticed this last night. It's a real problem. 
---
How dare you imply game informer should do a 5 second Google search.
---
What cpu also?
---
this is a good idea, before I  started my new character I was helping low levels,  but this is what is different from the first run through is that most people are not doing the early missions, maybe that will change with the new patch and content, hopefully we have people coming back, starting new characters and new players joining.  
---
What about Harpoon Gun? I didnt see there pictures in your link
---
Amigo - put out a request for people to travel with on this or another FO:76 sub reddit. Don't forget to put what system you have the game on. Also do you have a mic? If so state that as well. Good luck finding peeps to explore Appalachia with :)
---
I typed another comment earlier.  Maybe you can give me insight...
---
So I fermented bourbon.  Got a regular version.  Now,  how do I make it age further? 
---
Not enough insults.
---
Can you scrap your junk? What about scrapping weapons/armor?
---
I get that message when the servers are down for maintenance. Try resetting console and don't stress about it. Its just another Bethesda feature.
---
I'm talking about real bloodied builds everyone, not some random build that has some bloody guns. I'm a bloodied build and really don't mind the nerf but it indeed appears to be adrenal reaction was nerfed. 
---
Yes, I really really want that lamp. I'd totally buy it in the atomic shop (but be cooler if I could actually find it. It's much more neat finding an item you really wanted than just buying it).
---
I'll have a look there at some point. Thanks. I accidentally set my camp not knowing I couldn't just pick it up again. This is going to take a little time to get use to.
---
Yea, prices are definitely everywhere on these. I've heard that it works better when you out the charging shotgun barrel on it.. then it can be devastating.. however, you lose the arc to tag multiple enemies
---
That's sometimes how random drops work. I've gotten probably 8 ultracite or marine plans from them. I got the double barrel reciever last night from one. I can assume I've killed 200 of them though 
---
I never denied it at all, I would have not done it if someone was there. Dont make it a point of taking others items....
---
Do we know for sure they, themselves, developed it? Or could it have come from here with them just claiming they developed it?
---
Lolz
---
..yea I wasted a card at .charlie - my time was 249hrs 13mins..
---
https://youtu.be/zzcvTjXEElc
---
That was where I went my first time!
---
You maniacs! You actually did it! Ah Thank you! Thank you from the wasteland!
---
I have the nuka cola stash box. I always put it in when ever I claim a workshop. I'm kinda curious if it stays a nuka cola stash box when I leave the server.
---
And its probably wise to look up the nuke codes when you get to them. Working them out is a huge pain, as I've heard.
---
Items for display have to be in your STASH. So most likely what this will do is enable a placeable object that *looks* like the item. Meaning people won't be able to pick it up anymore than they can your statues or other ploppable decorations.
---
Once by accident when I was exploring the cave during a Rosie the Raider quest at about lvl 30 and 2 level 100's popped in a started the quest. Haven't been back and don't intend to be back especially now I'm lvl 100+ &amp; have no intention of wasting ammo on a dice roll for level 35 &amp; 40 mediocre legendaries. Easier ways to get more XP and better legendaries without having to go spelunking. Maybe if they up the mole miners to level 50+ so they'll drop better loot I'll take a gander but until then I honestly don't see the point.
---
You probably didn't re get your adrenal reaction when they broke it.
---
Hur dur dur youtube video. Hey guess what? Extensive testing has shown that you can‚Äôt do more than slap damage unless the attacked person has initiated pvp. If they own a workshop someone can contest it, travel to the owners location, and then kill them. How about before whining and spreading false information you sit down and actually look up the basics to what you‚Äôre saying 
---
1) You have to scrap your junk down, it‚Äôll save you carry weight. Just go to any workbench &amp; use the  scrap all option. Be warned, that will also scrap any bulk scrap you‚Äôve got. 
---
2) You can solo all the way to the SBQ fight but you‚Äôll need help to beat her. 
---
I think it was one of the EARLY updates. I remember shortly after launch discovering I could do this, being level 20-30 range and thinking "thank mothman that'll save me some caps!" Then they changed it and I got sad.
---
No you cannot do any actions.  Basically you can log in starve and die.  Till you have destroyed all you own down to the carry weight max limit.  Must click DESTROY on guns, resources, food, ammo, ores or whatever you need to to bring weight to under 1500 lbs plus carry weight.  Destroy till under then you can trade, sell, eat, craft etc.  Till they you might as well be dead lol
---
+50%(+50%)=75%.....
---
Apparently it does . Polar bear igloo posted the video on you tube today check it out yourself .ist perk 100% 2nd 200 3rd 300 .
---
Any update on naming PA?
---
Ryzen 3 is recommended here, "The best bang-for-your-buck build in this entire page. It goes neck-and-neck with the PS4 Pro and XBOX One X in performance while offering the flexibility in your gaming experience, such as if you prefer fancier graphics or framerates smoothness. This build, is suitable for running most modern games at 1080p/60fps/medium settings.
---
It provides for PC versatility, as well. Do you want to play at 144 fps on a 144 Hz monitor for your First-person shooters? Perfect. Lower your settings and your framerate shoots up. Do you care less about the frame rate than the extreme-quality visuals? Wonderful. Crank those dials up and witness the glory." https://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds  
---
Also, https://www.gpucheck.com/compare-multi/amd-radeon-rx-580-vs-amd-radeon-rx-570/amd-ryzen-5-2600-vs-amd-ryzen-3-2200g/high says that it will do 84.2FPS on HIGH, and 49.2 on ULTRA. So I think it is a good budget card these days.
---
Now I want to place a Cryolator in a display case, just so everyone who played Fallout 4 can be like "I'm coming back for you later."
---
Think they have the asset you can build already just need it to do what youre asking
---
Actually, you could not turn it because it was the ONLY staircase.  Make another staircase going up and then you can turn it.
---
If you using the scrap perk card you will get more scrap from manually scraping. You can almost complete the game by yourself. The end game is launching a nuke. You can launch it any where on the map. This will complete the game. If you hit Fissure Prime the Scorch Beast Queen will come out with a ton of Scorched creatures. You will not be able defeat them and the Queen by yourself. 
---
I might have been wrong with my previous comment. I‚Äôm testing some stuff out as we speak to see how long it takes regular alcohol to become vintage. It‚Äôs been over an hour and everything is still in its ‚Äúbase‚Äù form. I‚Äôll let you know when I figure it out. 
---
He is just venting some Excess Gas, I would likely do the same with someone pointing an AK47 at me.
---
There isn‚Äôt any incentives to really have high level players do the events or help with quests and it can even make them harder with level scaling to the highest player. The only time I saw higher level players go back to the start was when Feed the People gave items to the entire server.  But hopefully when I go on tonight I‚Äôll have some people on that side of the map or people joining in. 
---
They should bring back the robot workshop, I loved having my brobot in FO4
---
I drank it twice. The first time brought me to a random desolate place that almost looked like an outdoor church. There was a mini stage and pulpit and maybe 10-12 chairs facing it. I was somewhere north in the Savage Divide, east of Palace of the Winding Path and west of the Pumpkin House. The second time it left me in the Ash Heap near one of the abandoned mine locations.
---
Oh I understand now, thank you
---
At work have a recent password reset that you keep forgetting about, get the alert that you'll be locked out if you fail one more time, so you stand up, step away for a moment and it resets so you get another three attempts.
---
I'm too anti social to try to sell to random players. But I'm not going to put my camp some where more visible. I'll just try cheap prices so if you find my camp you get rewarded with a cheap shop.
---
Since C.A.M.P.s are replaced when you join a server and that place is already occupied maybe you could get a willing friend to build when you're set up and join his server? I'm only thinking of quick fixes but this definitely needs to be fixed thank you for the warning.
---
yes in the new questline the fermeter you get says "display item" or something like that now this is just telling it you want to ferment the nuka but i assume the shelves and display cases will work like this
---
Just like many other posts today and yesterday, it‚Äôs either a bug, or to prevent people from nuking the area of the limited event. 
---
I don't give a damn about numbers and formulas. But i can tell you exactly what happens. 90% is the cap tho,that's true.
---
You can use the perk at level 3 Or use 3 pieces of food reduction armor and lvl 1 perk card. The result is the same overall weight.
---
Anything over that is useless and you won't even see your weight decreasing.
---
You want kombucha or??
---
I did 
---
Oh well screw it. It‚Äôs to late now but I build a new base so I‚Äôm happy. 10 rocket turrets ftw! https://imgur.com/gallery/nUvsX9s
---
I know he post a video so bad this perk doesn't work with nuka shine :(
---
Legendary wooden spoons if that ain‚Äôt a big FU 
---
I dont know what is lolz
---
Pa and fire proof makes you immune to explosions
---
&gt; even if it goes F2P
---
Here we go again.
---
Ooook cool. 
---
I did the same thing last night.  I put 1 of each regular alcohol in the fermenter. And nothing happened. 
---
Another dude told me that if it doesn't have a cnd bar then it's done. 
---
I'm assuming you need the recipe to age further?  Idk.
---
When the info appears at the loading screens, one stated about a violent hive controlling the scorched. What I thought was that there is an entrance to a raid within Appalachia that allows us to traverse underground and find the source of the hive mind so that we can kill it for good.
---
The brotherhood were too caught up with scrochbeasts above that they no idea that the threat was coming from below. Fissure sites always come from underground, I don't understand why they wouldn't remove those areas in the first place (without nuking)
---
It‚Äôs cool! Thanks for the info tho guys
---
After expanding my farm to accommodate more razorgrain and corn, i couldn‚Äôt agree more with this post. 
---
O.o I want to nuke Mortontown so badly now. Trollolol.
---
I don‚Äôt feel lonely and I haven‚Äôt played with anyone in a group since the BETA. 
---
I get the feeling we will be able to make robot companions at some point. looking at you, last tab on the roadmap...
---
That and you can get animal friends by specking into charisma. 
---
speakeasy door was amazeballs. shoot. while we're at it a maiden of mysteries type door, key card door, and whitesprings turrets would expand the way we build our bases.
---
Yes. The ultracite ammo is what sets off their "trigger". Once the trigger is set they look deeper into the account inventories to see what they have. If there is nothing else suspicious they shouldn't have taken action. My skepticism is in that you can't pick up 54k items in one swoop (don't ask how I know that). The max you can pick up is about 32k. So unless you were in the transfer menu with the bag and took 32k and then 22k ammo this wouldn't have even been possible meaning you must have known what you took unless there were two separate people/bags you took tons of ammo from.
---
The real issue is that 54k ultracite ammo isn't even that suspicious to me in 30 days. Say you run the queen only one time per day and use 2k shots on her. You could sell your drops from the queen and grind some other caps, buy up 10k ultracite ammo every few days and EASILY acquire a "suspicious" amount (over 60k in a month at that rate). The problem is this makes players nervous about playing too much, unjustly punishes their hardcore player base, and spreads rumors running rampant through the forums and airwaves. 
---
My issue is they provide no transparency into the bans. Their responses to the community are truly sad and disappointing but people seem to be living through it. Most have created at least 1 new account which raises their player number significantly. On top of that they have provided no insight into when the banned accounts will be unbanned. They've created so much ill will in the community the franchise and possibly the company could very likely end with 76.
---
Same message. Got Rascorpions. Was disappointed.
---
You killed a bad player who let you get in melee range in the first place, any decent player who knows what he is doing will mealt before you take one step even when using stealth.
---
Btw they will be shooting at you with full damage while you try to counter the assassin sentinel perks doing 0 damage, so you are always at huge disadvantage.
---
Regarding the counters
---
Vats crit - use stealth boy to negate vats
---
Stagger - admanutum rank 3 and reduce stagger time armor mods and you are good
---
What other counters you got ? 
---
Thanks, that makes sense. 
---
I'd love this as I'm both a magnet for SB..but I also hunt them for fun. I dunno about ALL of then being legendary...I typically take on 2 at a time down in the bog just by fast traveling to Delta...but at least SOME would be fantastic. I'm a PA heavy/melee build, so they aren't really a threat or spongey (I tend to use my Gatling over a 50cal or Gatling plasma). 
---
I‚Äôm confused?
---
Where the fuck did you get over 50k rounds of ammunition?
---
I will invest. From your experience, does it make TSE instagibs take time?
---
I dunno. I (a low level) got fast travelled unexpectedly to where a scotch beast was chilling and died within a minute. I‚Äôm not testing it out again for a good while now! 
---
I saw a roll of ductape on a table earlier today and got excited for a second. And my family must think I'm addicted to super glue because I pick it up every time I see a tube.
---
All the building set plans are sold by numerous vendors.
---
Whitespring Station is probably the easiest to get to.  And the building set plans are pretty much all it sells.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the heads up.
---
No, 45% from stabilizes, 50% from AA, 72.25% ignored.
---
Lmao!! Right!!! 
---
I am a software QA test engineer and you're exactly right. The first step is that the developers need to anticipate this kind of interaction and code for it so the bug doesn't happen in the to begin with, but QA are the last line in protecting the product you're putting out. We've had some very odd bugs found after release, but we always take ownership of what we let slide through and make action plans to prevent things like this from happening again. 
---
What platform?
---
I get a massive twitch whenever I see duct tape, like at Home Depot.
---
They added a stash box to the enclave bunker.
---
Every offer I‚Äôve been given is 20-30k every other offer below that is either on Xbox or Pc. Ps4 is filled with a bunch of people ripping each other off. If you come across one let me know
---
Yes? I mean, if your talking about voice chat, just go into a party and make it invite only. That way, you can‚Äôt talk to anyone who isn‚Äôt in the party. 
---
By the way, since you‚Äôve clearly done some testing, do you know what type of weapon it is? Does it benefit from pistol, rifle or heavy perk cards?
---
Instagibs?
---
I don't get why this is important to people. You only get perk point for each level after 50. You will very likely keep those points when you prestige, so nothing is lost except a 3 digit number next to your name, which can be earned back.
---
A level 300 player has no power differention from a level 50 player anyway, it's just a number. You probably got some decent legendaries, but it's not like you will lose them or your caps. 
---
It‚Äôs happened to me once also. Not every bot was aggressive, just the newly deposited ones. Hasn‚Äôt happened since.
---
I completely forgot about that.... Where is it again?
---
Sheesh yeah xbox we got decent deals lol 
---
Yeah, don't even waste your time on those. 
---
Right? It's amazing!
---
Yeah, just remove some of your foundation in the center of your building. If you're built on dirt,you can plant inside.
---
Called it, tbh.  I knew if people complained about the turret towers enough, Bethesda would *half* listen.  Instead of actually listening to the proposed solution (extending no build zone), though, they decided to just nerf everything instead.  Cool.
---
Well again, you can replace any non legendary guns and armor, so toss them. Then toss the junk that‚Äôs everywhere - ceramic, oil, leather, etc. then you have to decide between keeping screws/springs/ballistic fiber or stimpacks/rad-x/Radaway
---
Wood, steel and lead are everywhere. Dump them
---
Don any legendary armor with weight reduction perks, equip any perk cards that do the same. 
---
It‚Äôll hurt, but you can do it. 
---
The Harpoon isn't an Energy Weapon though?
---
Same issue, seems like food does less and spoils faster after the new update. 
---
Try talking to other players when you're nearby - I've made over 20 friends in game doing that lol.  But a npc companion would be cool, especially a dog since the dog helmet is in game.
---
dude, we get it, literally everyone that saw that light wants it, for literally everyone that makes a post asking for it or other Nuka Cola stuff, or anything really, the game is still getting content updates, we will most likely get what you are asking for...
---
What? No.
---
ya... here is the next problem. my resource generation is in the middle of that. 
---
dam wanted to add a roof top garden to my camp...
---
I got that today too, and for me, it was just mole rats.
---
FUCKING MADLADS!!!!
---
I'm a lil overprotective of my stuff
---
But it is a Heavy weapon. Im curious if it got a buff because the Flamer is a heavy that got skipped
---
Ah.  Yeah, that makes it difficult.
---
I mean I have never experienced a Bethesda live service game before and the last live service game I played before Fallout 76 was EA's Star Wars Battlefront II so you gotta understand were i'm coming from.
---
ya it does
---
Yeah I had a single vault tec linoleum foundation block that was turned the wrong way. 
---
Forever or temporarily?
---
Thanks, I understand now
---
It's a bug.  Because people are still nuking.  Had two drop last night (not on Morgantown though, which I really wish would have happened).
---
Just temp an in game hour I think but I use it when it counts 
---
time in Beth games has always had wierd bugs when you mess with it, my guess is the time that passes while you are out is having a weird effect on time overall...
---
That's all I want. I always collect the undamaged and preserved items to decorate with. I've got several saved in my stash in case we can ever decorate with them.
---
They cost 1350 though. I only have 500. I was hoping to trade maybe a few guns win someone and some caps
---
Nope, it's not the same problem. That post is about only being able to inspect the first item a vendor has, meaning they could actually inspect items.
---
This is different; the inspect option has been *completely removed* from vendors in the latest patch. Nothing in the patch notes about it, either.
---
Yes, this is how I've found great people to play with.
---
I just don‚Äôt get it... I‚Äôm low level (107) farm materials to make 308 and shotgun plus 10mm. One star and one piece of armor, and 2, 1 star weapons (10mm robot 30%, and a quad capacity shotgun) 
---
If I picked it up then I‚Äôm guilty but what then? If you pick something up how do you report it or what do you do with it??? 
---
I admit, I either use or sell what I find and if I can sell or scrap it, I dump it... 
---
Not sure what the rules say when you pick up something like I did? 
---
As far as the queen goes, I haven‚Äôt done that yet since last 2-3 times no one could kill it and I ran out of ammo...lol
---
Getting one/two shot in PVP by a TSE.
---
Good point 
---
I‚Äôve played solo the whole time, 634 hours last time I looked including solo nuke silo runs and launching nukes, when you launch one people will show up to help out especially if there‚Äôs a SBQ to take down, my biggest tip would be take your time, don‚Äôt rush and stay in the forest area to rank up for a bit before travelling to more dangerous areas. Also every time you see a work bench scrap all to save carry weight but be aware some things don‚Äôt auto scrap like beer bottles, you‚Äôll have to go into the junk tab and scrap them individually, they‚Äôre protected from auto scrapping because they can be used to make Molotov‚Äôs
---
I just spent way too much time on that site.  Good to know my work monitors are decent. 
---
It hasn't always been that way. Sometimes they'd explode right after death up to like a minute after and sometimes they wouldnt explode at all. Now it seems to always be right after death.
---
Yeah, first level support that you have to get through for your issue to actually get reported to devs is kinda frustrating because they're there to spit out macros, not think critically about the issue that you are encountering. This is just how it works, they rule out whatever they can before passing it on to second level support. Most of the time users don't give enough info to actually understand what's going wrong anyway.
---
Regarding the SBQ fight: if you nuke it, they will come. I think as long as you do it at a time when people are awake and playing, a decent number of players will always jump into a nuke zone when they see one.
---
really? the vaults were free to fast travel to?
---
General small tip, which you may already know: Not all general "stuff" is considered junk, meaning you may still have do something to it to turn it into scrap rather than "scrap all," and/or you'll have to go into you "misc." pipboy tab to find it. Examples of the former are different types of ore, which is in your "misc." tab and must be combined with acid to make scrap metals (which are junk). An example of the latter is gunpowder (found often on super mutants) which is also found in the misc. tab, but has to be manually entered if you want to put in stash. It can be a bit confusing at first.
---
The reason I mention it is because these materials can be quite heavy, and early game, it can be a source of a lot of used up carry weight without realizing  it. I still sometimes forget I'm carrying around gunpowder that I should stash.
---
That sounds suuuuuper cereal.
---
I have all of those for 200caps each
---
Dang. That's staggering. Wish there was a way for you to segment what's related to the new content vs changes to existing. Then you could obviously ignore the new Wild Appalachia stuff for right now. But I'm guessing there's no way to make that distinction.
---
Thanks for the links. I've seen where people somehow extract the locations of objects, like crafting tables, and put them on a map. Is this the correct tool for something like this?
---
i7 7700k
---
also 16gb of ram
---
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
Make them *optonaly* visible on the map.
---
how do people accidentally scrap stuff?  you get a confirmation screen, you literally have to press multiple buttons before you can scrap something, yet I see so many posts about "make such and such unscrappable"...  I mean I get it for mods and nuke zone stuff, but how is anyone scrapping armor or weapons accidentally?  even if this is your first Fallout there is a confirmation box before you scrap it!
---
  I take a look at my messy coffee table and just really with there was a "scrap all" button/option
---
Most plants don't grow well on rock.  Move your camp, or wait for planters etc to become available.
---
I saw an increase in workshop and non-workshop PVP several weeks before before the patch. So no. No further increase. 
---
I bet it‚Äôs going to be an entrance to those underground dungeons, along with that unmarked vault in another post
---
White Springs... its the only place you see bags of any type... this had to be also early in the month. 
---
There was cannon balls and harpoons in there as well, like instantly went over... keep in mind this had to also be before weight limit was set I guess since I have no idea how much that weighs in at? 
---
Protectsy
---
Why the downvotes bud? The cap reward is the bounty in pve, I'm not sure why it would be different in pvp. I'm also not sure why you would think the wanted system, which is absolutely going to be in pvp, will have more limited rules like you only get wanted for destroying a camp. That seems silly to me. The cap reward is the bounty and wanted players get bounties. Otherwise, how are they going to prevent campers from lurking at train stations and sniping people as they spawn in. Those people should become wanted and earn a bounty. Climbing through the ranks and earning a high bounty makes you a juicier target. There are rewards for being high ranked though to encourage people to take that risk
---
Yah, I'm guessing this guy doesn't hang out in the mire...
---
Really? Even bobbleheads are temporary in this game, lol. üòù
---
It's a buff from eating them, so it's temporary.
---
&gt; that Nuka-Cola machine speak easy door.
---
I have to admit, it took me entirely too long to figure that out. Would love to have one for a "hidden" room in my camp. 
---
Ran into Insult Bot yesterday... he just kept repeating himself... wouldn't leave me alone... so needy
---
It‚Äôs widely reported but is game-breaking so sure. Submit a ticket. Good luck. 
---
Wow I‚Äôm stunned ! I post about a possible new exploit against pve players and all I get is trolled!wtf ?! are you people playing this game ?it‚Äôs not whining it‚Äôs a fact -pve players are being attacked without taking workshops without pvp engagement, and yes under normal condition slap damage is fine but I‚Äôm not talking about normal , so  automatically I must be lying because this game is beyond reproach right?? 
---
I bet this has something to do with that terminal where you had to encode a code on an ID card also related to the other TNT Domes.
---
That sucks wow
---
It's soo needed on top of my nuka cola stash box!
---
Okay, i thought i was imagining things. Most of my ingredients spoiled before i could get to Biv. That's fast. Too fast. 
---
Thanks for this. I'm no longer falling through the world and now I can have my quality of life mods on again.
---
I'm at level 306 and I still hit it every time it comes up. The stigma against non-max level items is a bit silly, in my opinion.  I picked up a swing speed bloodied deathclaw gauntlet there that does 1200+ damage with my build and a fun little bloodied exploding combat shotgun that wails pretty hard.  They may not have the greatest resale value, but I'm not playing the game to get nuka-rich.
---
Just repair all for a tiny bit of junk if it does happen
---
It had more caps available after my purchase. I can‚Äôt say which faction though cuz he was at 0 to start and I had sold to all factions already. I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs tied to Watoga Station and grahm though. 
---
He just built inside a sewer underpass thing that's already there
---
Look in Atoms shop under Icons - that's where most of them are
---
I'm on xbox and it's happening to me as well, so it's not mod-related. The weird thing is that it doesn't seem consistent. My 3* exploding 10mm showed the stats on the left every time I inspected it, but my 3* Grog Axe only showed it ~25% of the time I tried to inspect it.
---
Thing I never understood about Gun-Fu lag is you can just press Z or C to cycle targets manually in VATS and there's no lag at all... 
---
I always knew that F76 playerbase war pretty stupid, but you just took it to whole next level of stupidity. 
---
I made this with the Mantis Marsala. I opted out of the carrots and I thought it turned out great. Mine was a little dry and lacking a bit of flavor probably due to not having enough butter. The Marsala was great, I wasn't too wild about the apricots in it though and I opted out of the leek to save a bit of money. 
---
I killed a dozen today including the SBQ and didn‚Äôt get one damn brain. It‚Äôs all I needed to cook the super SB casserole. 
---
Somebody posted a long while back that you could plant in the seam of two half floor pieces connected along the wide side. They even had a screenshot of it, where they had the pieces placed over water like a dock. They said it was finicky to do though. This may have been on the filthycasuals subreddit, if not here. Haven't tried it myself (down shoot the messenger!).
---
Could be the "protected" thing. It almost seems like you're trying to say something there with the quotes
---
Imagine that, researching expansions make you dumb
---
My frieng, still super low lvl, so pretty new and still learning.
---
You can milk Brahmin? Where have I been???!
---
My you do put an interesting spin on things.  My reply was meant to be helpful constructive criticism, but it seems your insecurity does not allow you to accept it as such.  Carry on.
---
Food buffs are temporary. That's why they need to keep farming them.
---
I don't think we're referring to the same thing. It only popped up temporarily and I wasn't near my teammate. I could see his name, out of my line of site, and a red skull above it. 
---
Also on my compass there is a star that recently appeared but nothing seems to be on my map.. Beginning the walk there to find out first hand I suppose!
---
I saw someone snapped plants (corn, mutfruit) to the edge of a campfire inside their base - is that still a thing?
---
Uh, you can have my Ultracite PA plans and damn ultracite explosive vents x5
---
how do i get access to the bunker lol
---
And hunger and thirst rates go up faster than they used to. I can fast travel from my camp to the other side of the map and I'm already dehydrated. Guess I'll have to start taking 50 purified waters with me when I go on a scavanging run because i am all over the map. Fix one thing and fuck up 5 more. This is getting ridiculous. 
---
100+ times easily 
---
I second this, would happily part with atoms for it
---
Pretty sure they removed that but we should have a non bug way to be able to plant inside. 
---
I had a pair show up and all i heard was gunfire, logged out asap and logged back in to find half my camp leveled as they were lobbing grenades when i left. 
---
Happened to me yesterday, I was too tired to be angry about it and let it download
---
Yeah. I saw a post yesterday and thought no way. Hes lying but sure enough i milked a brahmin and than i drank its milk. 
---
Enlightening.
---
Thanks, let me know and if it changes with the perk card removed and re-added.  
---
Last couple patches had a similar problem, all cards had to be removed and re-added
---
I saw 2 bottle caps on the ground and fought the urge to pick them up.   Probably should of, just in case.
---
You can also now craft radios for your camps! Haven't seen anyone post about that yet! 
---
Right. 
---
  There are "2 unused" points shown under the Strength column
---
  But the only unused strength card I have is packrat 1 (and I've already maxed out the packrat card)...I think I still have one point before I max out the melee speed/weight, and one more to max out armor, but have 4 more levels before I get another pack.  Tis OK, I'll have fun getting there.
---
Thx for clarifying it for me.
---
The trailer mentions release dates.
---
...in the description.
---
[Here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=xbox+store+fallout+76)
---
&gt;People are not willing to sell their most valued items for the in game  currency, caps. It‚Äôs basically a barter economy when it comes to  anything deemed especially rare or valuable. This is a problem and  leaves everybody worse of compared to a situation where players would  accept caps as a currency. 
---
a) what's wrong with bartering?
---
b) have you checked [Market 76](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/)?  plenty of people want caps for their stuff...
---
&gt;there is very little to spend the caps on in game. With the notable  exception for plans and mods, the vendors offer close to nothing which  is not readily available to be picked up. 
---
plans, mods, weapons, armor, there is plenty of stuff in vendor inventories to spend your caps on, sometimes there is even a good legendary.  a lot of stuff in this game is not even close to "readily available"...
---
&gt;Caps are mostly useless 
---
yeah, no they're not...
---
&gt;you cannot have more than 25k 
---
didn't even know this was a thing, never got close to that number in 100+ levels
---
Valid. I'm sorry for my admittedly elitist assumption. üòû
---
I think I left 3 pieces for the next person
---
Alien blaster is somewhere else. You didn‚Äôt miss it.
---
I won‚Äôt spoil the location unless you want me too.
---
My theory is whoever found it felt the walls closing in and tried to dispose of it or hide it. Hence why it‚Äôs not in the dome. I could be wrong though. 
---
Every vendor per faction/location is connected, so if you take all 200 caps off of one in whitesprings youll have to wait 20 hours for the next reset. Theres 7 diff vendors equaling a max of 1400 caps per day. Also when you buy itll be a fraction of it
---
Yeah man living the dream
---
The lookup failed was linked to better inventory for a number of people having similar issues...  
---
If you've not, try one boot with no mods installed, see if it shows up the same 
---
I wasn't talking about hellfire I was talking about the enclave power armour.
---
It's your mods/custom .ini
---
Hmm. Okay then. Wonder if it's new with the update.
---
I will and thank you again lord of grammar your insight is invaluable and I strive to one day be worthy of your laments!!!
---
STRONG NEEDS MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS!
---
Good info, thanks, I'll try to replicate on PC 
---
I agree with what you are saying. I wish it was like that too. 
---
If you want this to get attention, post this on the Bethesda forums, reddit is good to connect with players or vent about the game. But suggesting changes here is just a fart in the wind. 
---
That is worth 100 screws lol
---
It will protect you vs tse weapons, keep in mind there are more op weapons then tse, and always crouch in pvp situation there is no other protection vs vats builds and head shot will always kill you. Crouching makes you untargetable in vats
---
They're bugged out though
---
I had issues where after placing a few items in my camp from the stored tab it would say nothing was selected and not let me place anything. Exiting the build interface and re entering it fixed the problem for a few items, then repeated. Also could not highlight the conduit power point to attach wires. If I went from an object to the power point it would attach. Only experienced it with the through wall conduit.  As well as floating crops when placed on a slight hillside. 
---
Thanks.
---
Yea this game needs an in-game player market, like every major MMO, so that we can buy and sell 24/7. Maybe have a big terminal+vault in the Enclave. I hate waiting around my "gunshop" CAMP hoping I bump into someone who has the specific legendary weapons and armor I want. Most players are too afraid to trade on PC due to the few instances of hackers "trade stealing".
---
It could be an option on your physical CAMP device.
---
That way only you can access it and you don‚Äôt have to go trough the building menu to craft an extra thing and take up space. 
---
Dude, it's all over reddit. Many posts. It's a glitch. They are working on it.
---
Relax.
---
If you‚Äôre camping then you‚Äôre going to be higher on the leaderboards and thus other players can see your location on the map. That‚Äôs how they‚Äôll prevent campers. 
---
I‚Äôm not proposing more limited rules for the wanted system.. you only become wanted for destroying a base or or picking locks in an owned workshop and that‚Äôs how I think it should stay. 
---
You‚Äôre confusing the hell out of me with your definition of bounty. You get bounties for killing players that are wanted that have BOUNTIES on their head! If you engage someone in normal PvP you receive a cap reward for killing them.. these are 2 separate things you‚Äôre confusing as one. 
---
Also paragraphs help my dude just fyi. 
---
Brilliant! I want this. 
---
Not if it's your base and you're wanted. I think
---
Powerarmor is something that you use when you want to lose in pvp. Damage resistance via armor is useless. Damage distribution is the way to go (sentinel/assasins/cavalier/blocker).Damage resistance of 1000 is useless if you get hit by 1500 dmg shots. Use few assasins (-8%) from players and sentinel/cavalier (-15% damage) and you are good to go. Those distribute the incoming damage so 1500 dmg shot becomes much less and then your armors damage resistance does the rest. Also TSE is not god tier anymore after TSE nerf. Bloodied (+explosive) is the new meta especially when they buffed the sweetspot for bloodied build hp that generates more damage.
---
Excellent. I hope this takes off. 
---
I was thinking of pulling together something similar but hadn‚Äôt gotten around to the formal rules I knew I would need. 
---
I wanted to use Tiny Tim‚Äôs Livin‚Äô In The Sunlight for its happy versus tragic contrast but was a bit stuck on whether it would meet my rules. The recording is from ‚Äò68 but the song is from the ‚Äò30‚Äôs. 
---
Similarly I thought of Fly Me To The Moon, both for its era,and its association with the post apocalyptic Anime Neon Genesis Evangelion.  
---
3 hours
---
Thanks homie üëç never thought I was gonna get a reply. But I didn't give up. Thanks for not letting me down. 
---
Not sure if it was by design, or an early bug, like it thinking the other vaults were the same as 76 (I discovered this in the 1st week of release). Hopefully someone from the Bethesda team will correlate/correct me? (While you're at it fix the damn brick wall keypad!)
---
See !I‚Äôm already learning only one exclamation!
---
I saw someone nuke morgantown last night on ps4 and though what a jerk but than i appreciated the humor of it.
---
I do it for the steel and the glowing meat. Probably about 75 times. 
---
I had to turn up some audio to hear him better.
---
Yep, same thing here.
---
Scattershot kills it. I think each beam from it dings your durability
---
I just mean he could be new to fallout out. But yeah I feel you. I wouldn‚Äôt go reporting people for killing me so I don‚Äôt know what he was thinking. I‚Äôm sure he was raging out a bit lol
---
I told my father I had some cloth to make a new baseball outfit that he was looking for 
---
One can hope.
---
Do you have a custom ini file in your My Games folder? (even if it is as of yet not modified).
---
Right!! Lmao!! 
---
Seeing those turrets on the small floors gives me flash backs to ark. 
---
This is ragequit
---
I have 2 Xboxes, and run multiple characters for trading, I keep all my vendor characters below level 5 to avoid any PvP issues with them.
---
Other players tend to assume I must be a duper when they see my 150+ &amp; level 2 characters trading, so I've been attacked several times, and had some very upset when I kill them.
---
The other issue is players wanting to trade with my main, which I seldom do, unless I'm in voice chat with someone I've done trading with in the past. Random trade requests can be someone just checking you out for PvP, and I don't carry trade items on my main anyway.
---
Some players get very upset when they request my primary weapons and I won't sell. I had one request my TSE Handmade then message my that they only had 600 caps, but really needed one, I'm guessing they were a spoiled 12 year old.
---
God damn it you all planned this 
---
I doubt you'll see this, would allow players to basically fast travel all over the map for free and bethesda seems like they are trying to minimize the number of caps in the game by limiting vendor values, making things so expensive etc. That being said it would rock.
---
Just wondering, how does ‚Äútoon‚Äù mean character?
---
Dude it‚Äôs always been viable. Durability was the only issue. The damage is insane. I‚Äôve killed scorchbeasts in like 3 seconds once it landed. 
---
My daily quest today was to make ‚ÄúHoppy Hunter‚Äùso I now have the recipe for that, can‚Äôt remember exactly what it does, think it improved gun accuracy or something
---
Ok thanks. 
---
Also can you not drop items to decorate your camps? 
---
No but for real I am searching high and low and can't find it, sorry bro. 
---
They have the dirt tiles in the game at Flatwoods, I dont see why they wouldn't be able to make them usable in camps
---
For #3 I found I did not have to relog. I just had to exit the build interface and re enter it. But it was just a temp fix and had to do it multiple times. Pain in the ass when you are trying to rebuild a whole camp from the stores tab. 
---
Thanks, will check into these and report later tonight
---
There's a decent veganized version of mac and cheese that uses starchy veggies and carrots for the "cheese" sauce. 
---
Much of the fun of that quest was peoples' reactions when they saw you. "You really went on a tear list night Dragyborn!  Nord, Nord, Nord,...."
---
We got no peeps here. It would just be a linnear scavenger hunt. I'm glad they didn't do it.
---
This was something that occurred to me during the quest. It felt almost like a fair ground ride, rather than an immersive adventure. That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, but seeing all these other folks on the scavenger hunt was not immersive, at all.
---
This or planters, yes please.
---
We can craft fusion cores, we understand nuclear fusion, but can‚Äôt put a plant in a pot in our camp.
---
Fun Fact: One of his voice lines contains his full name. Its Biv E. Ridge.
---
I‚Äôve got this bug too , can play find on my second character but my first one disconnects as soon s I join a world 
---
That code popped up for me on PC during maintenance when I tried to log on. It's only while servers are offline.
---
I feel your pain.  Question though: why are you claiming PvP workshops if you don't want to PvP?
---
Thanks for the info, the floating crops is not new I regret, but I'll play with the others and see if I can replicate and will report.
---
Is crossplay supported? But even then, what about reshades?
---
YES! I want that and the prestige system you have planned.  BGS please see how this will bring players back, and keep us long term guys super happy. 
---
I'm already seeing people rejoin after quitting, and new players asking if they should buy it....answer is **yes**.
---
Not yet, but that's coming in a future update
---
This is the first time a salute photo has been justified.  Thumbs up my friend!
---
Well I mean the leaving and coming back trick isnt really an intended function lol. Its pretty much an exploit. Personally ive done it a bunch of time but expected it to be patched sooner or later.
---
Every login, server hop and fast travel gives a hit on condition of fresh food and drink, it is time passed. The lesser known cost of fast travelling (and apparently logging in and out). Especially after a patch when everyone is fast travelling around to do dailies/weeklies/new quests/looking at new content you tend to notice it more.
---
I literally haven't been able to play the game for months as there's a now patch to install every time which takes 24 hours for me üò£üò£üò£
---
I woke up on a cliff just south of miners bed and breakfast, and it was really high up. I‚Äôm really confused how my character got there.
---
Scrapping dozens and dozens and dozens of looted weapons and armor in a row will get you there.  Your brain gets trained that to scrap something, you hit the button twice.  It's automatic.
---
Add in a few beers, conversing with teammates, and you have a recipe for disaster.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it means that enemy is needed for you to complete a mission 
---
If they need to be killed to finish a quest they will be marked like that. Other than that I'm not sure. 
---
Point taken.
---
  Similar scenario, though.  
---
  I'm usually overencumbered, and at my level, I would not FT to join an SBQ fight, but since I can't FT away, if a fight pops up around me, I'l be inclined to do what I could.
---
And if I died in the process, I'd come back hunting my junk....
---
In the ‚Äúlight‚Äù source on the crafting menu there‚Äôs a campfire, you can grow crops on the campfire
---
This is exactly why I'm waiting a bit for everything to die down before I even try to check out anything new. Immersion is important.
---
You trying to get rank of general for enclave? If so, that.
---
They usually don't. You're using some identification scope that tags your enemies.
---
You may need to wire it up to a generator 
---
Its a quest item or a marker for a kill in order to get a reward.
---
Yup, easily 20-30% longer, actually went back to older videos I have posted to see the difference when it just felt slower.
---
If you make trailer about features that expansion includes, like they did. After user has seen it and he now needs to go and do a research about expansion, then your trailer failed to deliver what it was supposed to deliver. This wasn't cinematic or teaser trailer for upcoming game, where user needs to now go and search up the game. It was straight preview trailer of features that "Wild Appalachia" expansion includes. Expansion that on Beth site is labeled as "Available Now".
---
I've been thinking about doing this, had blueprints set up for a inn. I barely got anyone to ever visit though.
---
What does it sound like? Are there words to the song? I don't know which event you are referring to exactly. 
---
I was about to say use player vending when it comes out and camp near flatwoods to sell your plans for 1 cap or 0 caps if it's an option.  But the more I think about it, someone can just come along and buy all your plans and sell them for a profit. I think we just need an emote saying "Free shit in the bag, take it".  You can always position yourself in front of the bag and to the right.  Then use the team up emote.
---
I like your idea but paragraphs would help my dude.
---
I get broken weapons and armor along with going through food for health and really get nothing so I just ignored them, unless I can't.
---
No it‚Äôs not like fallout 4 etc :( but they are bringing camp decorating to the game (not sure of exact date) and they‚Äôve so far confirmed we will be able to display bobble heads and weapons. If you drop something it just ends up as a brown paper bag so the way it will probably work is you‚Äôll have a display case sharing room with your stash and you‚Äôll mark items in your stash that you want to display on the display case, shelf or piece of furniture but we will have to wait and see
---
Yes the first section of Wild Appalachia is available now. 
---
Every company shows the entirety of the expansions in a trailer dude, and only releases it in parts. It's common sense
---
Don‚Äôt want to spoil too much, but you need to go to a location in the mire and find a dead enclave guy.
---
Question, have you noticed 9/10 times you log in an oversight mule (2k+) your attacked with in 2 minutes of logging in, often before you finish logging in?
---
test it....only you can answer that question given your perks/mutations etc...
---
Also, test condition b/c a great dmg weapon that breaks quickly is of now real value.
---
I thought that you designated items already in your stash as elligble for sale (or not). Otherwise, everyone gets a stash size increase in the amount of the vending machines capacity. 
---
True, almost as they turn the Ultracite in to a Excavator and the Excavator into a Ultracite , lol
---
We did, back in the 70‚Äôs:
---
[A Boy and His Dog](https://youtu.be/5BDxqhI9qDw) 
---
Bugs me too, 
---
I couldnt tell you. I know for sure its not a rifle. I just dont have any heavy/pistol cards on my lvl210 character. Hard to believe i didnt have any. I dont spec into % damage cards because i think damage in this game doesnt matter for the most part. I kill the queen and people in pvp with just bloodied/anti-armor, adrenal reaction and chems. 
---
Found one on the post I saw: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/aoq7cz/keeping\_it\_filthy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/aoq7cz/keeping_it_filthy/)
---
I found a robobrain that fired projectile rockets out of his back earlier. It killed me üòÇ
---
OMG there is so many good bits added to the book, defiantly worth picking up if only to read. 
---
no nuclear materials? looks like fake
---
yes.
---
U sound so much better than all of us,
---
Those that were patient and worked with the game through its mistakes.
---
Those that enjoyed every bug knowing it would be gone.
---
Those that watched many cry and leave only to see new ones join with eyes in awe.
---
Those that may have doubted, but strengthened their own resolve in the end.
---
Those that did not leave.
---
Those are all of us. This game has been enough, now it‚Äôs more than enough. And you don‚Äôt deserve to come back. 
---
That‚Äôs a good, I‚Äôm thinking maybe add a  ‚Äú rather large spider‚Äù somewhere in the game, and then have a brief ‚Äúflash‚Äù showing the spider and your dude running away. Then it cuts back to the silo, and your person says ‚Äúthis will show that damn spider‚Äù 
---
Then it should be a 50/50 it kills the spider, vs makes it super big and rampaging. 
---
PROTEKT AND SERVVE
---
Whats your offer?
---
Go into charisma. There are pacify perks that you can purchase that allow you to gain animal companions. I'mma about to do it just to get a wolf friendly. 
---
112 DR
---
Thanks for spreading the good word!
---
Is it in both Frat houses or just one of them, and if so which one? Haven't seen one and if I'm gonna have to server hop to get one it'd be nice to narrow down where I need to look.
---
Oh no... not the frost spiders!
---
Nah, I noticed it as well. 
---
It‚Äôs in both the frat houses.
---
I'm thinking about searching the estates again to see if anything changed there. Figure that's the only breadcrumb I have to follow for now.
---
Do you have posters or things on the walls? Sometimes the height/placement thereof can make things tricky.
---
Spot on.
---
It's mutant antigravity grain. Roll with it. 
---
So this is what it's like seeing a man riding a giraffe telling another man to get off his high horse.  
---
That hits close....
---
yep
---
Currently have 300 caps and a instigating Shishkebab.
---
Awesome! D'you have any more hints as to where I'm looking? Like in the bedrooms or on a couch or something?
---
You have the chance of asking it to be added for free, yet you jump straight to "add it to the Atom Shop so we spend money"
---
-_-
---
I tend to fast travel a lot in my ordinary play. Like a minimum of ten times in a play session of, oh, two hours. Normally I could hit a nuke zone, log off overnight, then log back in the following day and fast travel to multiple vendors selling flux before it went inert. 
---
I guess I can't rule it out entirely, but I'm pretty sure it's not just observation bias. 
---
They require electricity 
---
sure, I spam both as well, but with the knowledge that I could accidentally scrap something I really want in the back of my mind so I am more mindful while I am spamming, no beers on my end but plenty of weed and I still haven't accidentally scrapped something in any Fallout game, just be mindful...  
---
having said all that I do understand, and for serial spammers like us I would like to see a way to lock items from being dropped and/or scrapped...
---
When I joined events like feed the people after they started I would help because it was me just bashing a bunch of lvl 1 ghouls. But your right if I was in the group it would level up so I would be more of a hinderance then help 
---
laughing at "literally" 
---
That is pretty much Michigan... JOKING from an Ohioian

Tse with the demolition expert perk. +60% damage
---
I just looked at all over the house tbh.
---
LOL!
---
If you are on Xbox let me know where.
---
Okay well thanks! Gonna start hopping now I guess
---
That has been patched
---
Even put on my smart threads to give it maximum respect.
---
the second floor of Top of the World should have been a passive zone and player hub...

I'm online now, I'll do 250c so you have grocery money

I have never seen enough cryolator ammo in one place to able to test if was worth weight in the moment of sell or keep. i think i had like 50 at one point and i aimed it at an npc and it with "fffth...." for about a second and then went eh this is shit. 
---
Lol. Oh well...
---
And the bug that after you scrap the last piece of junk, a random apparel is item is shown.  As someone else said, you get on autopilot scrapping a bunch o stuff at once, poof.
---
Thats how I accidntally scapped my dirty clown outfit....I was not a happy camper after that - its my favorite outfit so far....
---
and I have no idea what I did with the black dress w/ the green stripe.
---
i notice this is only for the ghouls at whitespring??? lol
---
Resources and the radiant PVE quests.
---
I'm more than willing to PVP, but not unfair one-shot battles.
---
Silva homestead and Billings homestead. Lots of corn and razorgrain
---
I am waiting, Jesterskull25
---
Even so, without scattershot it lasts maybe 2 clips? Still totally unacceptable.
---
The event itself was downloaded in the last patch, so they basically just have to turn it on when the day arrives, It looks like the sheepsquatch is going to be a new creature in the world, rather than one mythical beast.
---
I don‚Äôt know the answer but I was wondering how you get your damage so high to begin with?  I have a two shot gauss, maxed rifle perks, tank killer and only get about 280. I don‚Äôt do bloodied. Any suggestions to help me out?
---
Yeah, so for anyone interested, assuming 5 pieces of armor (2 arm, 2 leg, chest) with a given "20% reduction of weight for X" this is how it'll work:
---
\# of Bonuses| Total Weight (nearest%)
---
:--|:--
---
0| 100%
---
1| 80% 
---
2| 64% 
---
3| 51%
---
4| 41% 
---
5| 33%
---
Assuming you had another perk like "90% off of X" for the same item, you could get it to 
---
3% of total weight by taking 90% more off.
---
might be to strip off potentially incompatible Mods. Im on PS4, so just guessing.
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only one that struggled with this.  Spent 10 minutes looking for it in wall decorations and everywhere else, walked away for 2 or 3 minutes, came back and found it right away.  
---
&gt;2 cups Water
---
Theres like 10 rads in there. 
---
Good luck, are you on ps4?
---
Those divisions are usually thousands or hundreds of players across muliple servers that can have thousands or hundreds of people.You wouldn't call Minecraft an MMO, even with as large as some servers, so why would a game billed, built, marketed and designed alongside Online Survival Games like Rust not also be... You know, an Online Survival Game.

This is the official game soundtrack Playlist off of YouTube. There's some bangers in here, I hope it's in there-- I don't know what you're looking for exactly.

well fucking run then.

Totally :)
---
It‚Äôs the same as my reddit name, Atomogen.
---
I know, never said I do not know how to manage what I own I said I was angry I am put into this situation by Bethesda because no protocol was in place at launch to stop me from harvesting, keeping, my reward weapons, crafting food etc.  I like having back up of supplies for days when I just wanna take over all the workshops, or roam the lands and not worry if I have enough food, water, stims and ammo.  I know what my options are for reducing my weight.  I am just not going to do it. :o)
---
Sad times :(
---
Why dont you all ask for the planter boxes that exist all over the map currently. 
---
That sounds familiar and easy :) 
---
r/madlads
---
Yup! You wanna swap if one of us finds extras? ü§£
---
Are you okay bro
---
&gt; be buying another USD$60 worth of Atoms 
---
Lol. That shit has literally no value.
---
My game crashed while I was fighting the ‚Äúparty crasher‚Äù ghouls. Touche, Bethesda.
---
Run, Forest, Run.
---
I have one extra if you want it.
---
Or it could be a terminal like the Vault-Tec Personnel Management System in FO4.  But since there aren't settlers to manage, it would be the Vault-Tec CAMP Management System (or CAMP SITE/CAMP FIRE if you can figure out a way to make those acronyms work).
---
Options could include "make CAMP visible on maps", seeing statistics of budget use, repairing individual items instead of just "repair all".  Maybe some STASH management options, like setting "always/never auto-scrap when crafting" rules if that's possible.
---
Each terminal would be tied to the user's CAMP, so just like the STASH, you only see your own info even if you're in someone else's CAMP.
---
LOL. Who were the guys on here talking about how the delayed patch release indicated what a thorough QA job Bethesda was doing?
---
I have seen them listed as Letters at a couple different vendors. Usually 10,500 caps or something crazy like that depending on your charisma.
---
By that logic you can camp and sit at number 4, reap the rewards, and incur little risk. That isn't a camping prevention system.
---
I'm just not sure how what you're proposing really incorporates a wanted system at all. Taking out someone's turret camp by train stations that is attacking me incurs a bounty? That seems absurd. Incurring a wanted bounty for initiating pvp makes more sense. 
---
I'm not entirely opposed to having a more limited wanted system in survival, but there has to be a system in place to discourage camping and griefing while still allowing for fun pvp. 
---
You would probably disagree with me on this, but I would also like a wanted system based on first aggression so there is still an incentive to play nice in any player hub that might arise whenever vending becomes an option. 
---
What I don't want to see is survival turn into a glorified deathmatch mode when there is potential for more dynamic gameplay and role play.
---
Added in a 'bonus' to the beaver damn, because my friend reminded me that beavers produce Castoreum, which is rather similar to vanillin
---
Oh already? Cool, like for free?
---
I didn't have this, try removing mods and scan/repair game files.
---
Slightly got my hopes up for a legendary chainsaw then too... 
---
He‚Äôs very quiet, I have subtitles enabled, switch them on it settings, it‚Äôs really handy for some of the quieter holotapes too

ok cool so ill take...

so thats 1800?  I'm ready when you are

LOL OF COURSE YOU HAVE A SHITBULL. The stereotype is never wrong.
---
yeah, im not that tired yet. Quite annoyed though.
---
According to fallout wiki you can find them at pleasant valley ski resort raider vendor bot and watoga shopping center BOS vendor bot
---
Shweet, add TheGrandDuke
---
I will add you in a bit.
---
Surely you mean just let it fly? 
---
Because planter boxes were a pain in the ass to use and it can't be much work to modify a foundation or floor piece into a new function
---
So the first time it took you to A.A.
---
You mark enemies with the recon scope.
---
yeah, my fire crops look kinda stupid right now, would be nice just to have a little farm instead.
---
Where do I get the damn plans to build the moonshine table!?! 
---
Depends on if you want to team or explore on your own. 
---
For the latter, an empty server can be a great thing.  Ditto farming for various items.
---
Since Morgantown is now a nukable location, I'm sure there'll be some high levels around at various times.
---
This is a bad idea, since it will prevent high level characters from assisiting and giving items to low level players, which is one of my main duties.
---
never installed any mods. the launcher has changed the directory to a new one (which doesn't exist) so thinks the game doesn't exist.
---
The only cement walls I'm aware of are in the defense section of the camp. You get them by taking any workshop for the first time
---
Toon town, MMORPG made by disney.
---
Your character was called a toon, its become a term since then for a character in MMO's. 
---
Ok psn is same as username
---
For my build it‚Äôs really anything 
---
Well it was a glitch. If you want plants move somewhere until you can have planter boxes 
---
Did you encounter it the same way? By joining a server and not being able to place your C.A.M.P.? Did you remove any drinks from your stash or did you just play for a while and then later on couldn't re-join the game?
---
Cool beans, I'm gonna see if I can track down a matching Cap in the meantime
---
they announced that with the roadmap.
---
the one thing they listened to that is urgently needed in the area of finishing the features of the current game systems. I would have preferred a combo of the other things that need finishing but this one was requested the most, a lot less than action bar customization, finished container system, streamline trade and perk and controls / customization, real modding for solving that if they cannot devote development to that
---
slip187o
---
LOL @ this sub: FO76 Wild Appalachia will be a game changer! This will really turn the game around ala No Man's Sky!  
---
Bethesda: Hold muh moonshine! Killing our remaining gamers' accounts is the ultimate game changer, and we won't have to pay to maintain servers and employ the D-team of developers we found in the Home Depot parking lot before long.
---
same problem
---
When you joined a server and your C.A.M.P. could not be placed did you go to your stash and remove the drinks from the "aid" tab?
---
Oh yeah no it‚Äôs still pathetic even without it. Makes no sense 
---
I removed some last night from stash without my camp in the world but I was able to play fine for a few hours this morning until reaching this bug 
---
I don't think it's in that list. It's a short loop ambient music that plays through a speaker at the "Bots on Parade" Bot Stop ‚Ñ¢ stations only during the events to protect the robots while they are reprogrammed by MODUS. It's like shopping mall / elevator music. 
---
Can you DM me the location? I want it.
---
my character does have that..but even when i use a diff gun the icons are there
---
They have planters.  I found the plans to it yesterday while questing.  Is this what you mean:  https://imgur.com/jL7QqXx
---
One of the guys in our group got it and took a screenshot of recieving it in the forbidden knowledge reward list. Knight paint is legit reward now.
---
Yeah, but do you have a beverage here man...
---
When I read your comment I heard it in Mr. Gutsys voice. 
---
I still want to display the heads of my kills like in FO4, though. The mounts are IG as well at that hunting lodge in Grafton.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll stick with character I think, haha. 
---
Okay thanks,  certainly won‚Äôt be buying them anytime soon anyway.
---
Max Nerd Rage, Max Bloody Mess, Max Rifleman, level 1 Expert Rifleman, level 1 Master Rifleman, Adrenal Reaction mutation, very low HP.
---
&gt; Max Nerd Rage, Max Bloody Mess, Max Rifleman, level 1 Expert Rifleman, level 1 Master Rifleman, Adrenal Reaction mutation, very low HP.
---
yeah my flux almost went bad pretty quickly
---
Totally agree :) 
---
But with pvp it‚Äôs who can one shot each other first... phantom devices &gt; any cards lol 
---
When I get home, I usually have to click the damn thing a couple  times to turn off the music.  It's like it knows it's turned off but is playing music anyway.   Love the look of the jukebox but not a fan of the music it plays.  Might be bearable if it had some upbeat tunes instead of the creepy haunted mansion music it plays.
---
People say wood is the best for stealth. But I run all vanguard marine armor with one chameleon peice.
---
This one should be good for weapons:

---
This is a full list of scrap mods for armor, barring patch changes, but you have to make some guesses about what they relate to as it uses internal names:
---
[https://i.ibb.co/5WvGhVk/armor-mods.png](https://i.ibb.co/5WvGhVk/armor-mods.png)
---
I'll have a go at a slightly more readable list of non-scrap mods. First misc mods. The exceptions here are probably Bethesda typos:
---
* Ultra-Light for anything except combat armor torso.
---
* Strengthened for anything.
---
* Dense for anything.
---
* Deep Pocketed for anything except marine armor (either torso or limb).
---
* Lighter for metal armor torso.
---
* BioCommMesh for anything except marine armor.
---
I think all the material mods are scrap unlocks, with the exception of Brotherhood of Steel (combat armor) and Shadowed (various). The helmet paints for these can be unlocked though.
---
It does +60%  for the gun damage? I thought it was just the little blast radius around it that had a set damage
---
I don't believe it's a companion, per se.  I think the pacified creatures hang around your camp, but I don't think they travel with you.
---
go to holotapes in pip boy and look for nuclear silo tapes open it will show you the sites and there cool downs.. each site has a (24 hour cooldown..might be wrong on time) and its just for that server so if you have 6 key cards as long as you have the codes for each site you  can nuke amywhere 3 times in that server and hop to another server and potentially nuke another 3 times if none of the sites are in cool down
---
When I went to school we learned about discrimination of protected classes this included religion, handicaps, race, sexual orientation, etc... I'm sure you can Google what a protected class is. 
---
It's likely a step back for you career wise, but I'm surprised \*someone\* in the industry hasn't offered you some sort of job.
---
A few more people have got them from tech data. One of the people in my group screenshotted getting it as a reward from the forbidden knowledge quest reward display, not the plan. Some console BoS players have also shown it existing there. So its legit.
---
That's serious?
---
What if they couldn't produce Enclave stash boxes? What if the means to make them had already been destroyed?
---
Wartime efforts demand resources be put to war.
---
They cut back on making coins, card and other items to use resources for the war effort. I would think this would be one reason why they sourced Vault-tech stashes and not their own.
---
Just a couple thoughts on why they didn't use or make them.
---
Oh I‚Äôd love a weapon stand to display things
---
Had to move my camp and when trying to place it now it tells me "needs support"
---
Thank you for the info. I‚Äôll check it out
---
If its a tse itll do +60% extra to the explosive damage, which on a tse weapon is a lot of it
---
nice, lolz. 
---
Lmao yes 
---
I know it wouldn't stop someone from launching artillery but just so you know, you can lock those shutters. 
---
Raw Flux --&gt; Inert Flux within a couple of hours now - with a maxxed "Good with Salt" equipped.

Power armor?
---
Oh alright thanks üëçüèª
---
Adding you now

Yea im sure thats coming, specially since nothing else fits the whole ‚Äúwild‚Äù theme better, they said to look out for a bunch more camp improvements so maybe thats included
---
Tiny Tim's an absolute classic for sure, and it hits the tone perfectly. I can absolutely see myself weaving through a firefight with it in the background. You're also right the recording does have a very Beatles / late 60s vibe to it, but the introduction is great for a playlist like this because it has the nice record intro. Hmm. 76 did add the Beach Boys though, so maybe I'm overthinking it. 
---
Fly Me To The Moon, on the other hand - added without hesitation! Awesome suggestion. Can't argue with Sinatra / Basie. 
---
"The Effective punsihment of not having the atoms..." for cosmetic items in an online game.  OH THE HUMANITY OF IT ALL!
---
and some serious studdering that feels like it's trying to crash
---
Quite a few of us have been talking about this over the last couple of weeks, it‚Äôll be a fantastic way to increase player interaction. I like the idea of an area or two with pre existing foundations (2x2), each player could then build their own shack/stall in addition to their existing  C.A.M.P. It would also serve as an area players acting as npcs could help new players. 
---
Upvoting in the hope the idea player hubs for trading gains momentum.
---
Making grape mentats counts for that challenge if that makes it easier, it‚Äôs just whiskey, mutfruit and mentats so that‚Äôs what I do, the recipient is available at the Enclave bunker medical wing if you don‚Äôt have it already
---
Knight paint is now a technical data reward (and confirmed by one of the guys in my group taking a picture of the actual forbidden knowledge reward "you got this" list from the turn in... so is legit). Still looking to see if paladin or higher pops up so if anyone gets it, take a picture in this same way of your turn in - make sure you get the reward list on the screenshot to prove it came from there. :)
---
I was hoping for a toga, maybe we will get one in the Atom shop.
---
None of that is in the game yet
---
They stay marked once you marked them even when you switch gun and when they are dead, I haven't played the latest patch yet though.
---
I said it before. Make a moving zone that is heavily guard by insanely high sentry bots. Hit a player get shadow realmed. Mob gets close, Swiss cheese. 
---
A moving zone gives players that either aren‚Äôt strong enough to venture in that area or go from the mire to the whitespring or the forest. 
---
Make a few or a ton of stalls that players and display their wares and whatnot. And boom. 
---
Leading theory is that it‚Äôs the location of one of the new underground locations teased in the trailer. 
---
yes, everything floats and it bothers me, the razorgrain one was so bothersome to so many people a modder [fixed](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixqomOsILhAhVDSN8KHbOzCUcQFjAAegQINxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout4%2Fmods%2F13823&amp;usg=AOvVaw2q00kzdU3VTMIQ7QYy2AsB) it in FO4
---
Not yet :(
---
I'll be testing tonight. I've seen screenshots of cooldown times from 36 hours to 240. So I'm just a bit confused. I'll update this post as we do some research on it. Thanks for the info.
---
Had to research what that was, I don‚Äôt know is 0.5% alcohol a lot? Never had the stuff but it seems some people say they can get drunk on it and others say you can‚Äôt. Certainly like the idea of making a non-alcoholic fermented drink. Might try it, I like tea so this might even go to some RL benefits.
---
Hat was the update? :0
---
They chose that based on where they plan on implementing new events/quests
---
I personally am using full weightless marine... except a leg which is combat armor for a lock pick bonus. When it comes to snipers you want armor for stealth.  
---
The best armors are in this order from top to bottom.  
---
1.Wood, do to its low weight, how cheap it is to get weightless, and its stealth upgrades. (seriously a full weightless set can cost as low as 1,000 caps.) IT doesn't have much protection but when you have a full weightless set with its stealth bonuses you are pretty much undetectable.   
---
2. leather, once again low weight and how easy it is to get weightless. Doesn't have the stealth bonuses of wood but has a bit more protection. Better if you know you might end up in a fight from time to time.  
---
3. Marine armor, weightless only. On all of these there is some inate stealth bonus the armor has... for marine it is just the fact that ultra light weightless weighs nothing with fully upgraded armor. Meaning it is the go to for a sniper who has CQB options like Shotgun or SMG spraying.   
---
It be so cool to nuke a cave somewhere and a giant spider would crawl out and go on a rampage, until you could get enough people together to stop it. 
---
I heard strange in numbers perk messes up adrenal reaction
---
There's lead in Aluminium cans to. 
---
glitches im assuming unkess they updated it
---
Same here.  I basically just did my regular stuff last night.
---
Yeah i use cavaliers assasin &amp; cavaliers unyielding.  They dont "let" me get in melee range. I kill sentinals daily... I run with a pvp group. We kill eachother and practice. I know how to kill sentinals...
---
I am aware that end game pvp comes down to stealth boy vs stealth boy vs berry mentats. Most players rocking sentinals. Some of us in cavaliers.
---
I dont see how it isnt balanced tho? I dont have trouble killing anyone. I do t have trouble being killed by the builds i know beat me.. Its like i know which people to run from. I drag them to my buddies who get them with vats crits... It is a team based rpg battle after all. Take any WoW type game.. Some builds may kill mages but get owned by rogues. Some builds might kill tanks and get owned by mages.
---
Melee comes down to swing speed. Which i dont love. Im 2h so i find the buzz blade is alot of fun. Sledges are in a bad spot vs all the fast speed unarmed one shot builds.
---
Some tweaks are necessary. But a nerf to sentinals is knee jerk and frankly a recommendation that screams "i dont have alot of PvP experience"
---
Power creep is coming. 5 star legendaries have been teased. I think a nerf is unjustified. 
---
Some other counters are certain gernades, recon scopes. The best counter is a good team with coordination. 
---
Its funny when 2 good teams come across eachother. Invisible everyone. Glowing pink from berrymentats. No vats. Blind swinging and gatling/shotgun shots blindly.  This "top end" meta is a bit silly imo.  We usually set up one guy with sentinals as bait at that point. Circle him with invisible melee boys who kill anyone who takes the bait. 
---
So is it balanced? Right now: its better than its ever been. Some tweaks would help but big nerfs are dumb. 
---
Id recommend:
---
Maybe make stealthboys targetable in vats beyond recon scopes.. Maybe  stealthboys would carry a  a -50% hit chance when targetted in vats to keep it a bit faster paced. But only if they are stealthboy'd and i have a berry mentats active, then i could vats them (with the -50% hit chance). 
---
Thanks! I would love to see it too. Endgame right now for me is trading, building camps and the rare nuke drop. Would love to see them go in this direction 
---
I have a stealth build and i shoot these things out of the sky using vats pretty easily, and the only vats perk i have is one rank of concetrated fire, i dont think they should be guarneteed legendaries, i also used a bloodied gauss rifle once and almost one shot the scorchbeast out of the sky, its not that they are not hard enemies, they are just hard for some peoples playstyles
---
I‚Äôve unlocked it for my left arm but not my right. I have it for both my legs and just missing my chest. 
---
Okay, the god damn roadmap is not that hard to understand. I give up on all these damn posts.
---
You can do BIV quests more than once? 
---
Is this new? We used to do multiple silo runs a night and never have had an issue. I started launching nukes right after the official launch and have never seen this.
---
It‚Äôs called SURVIVAL mode not baby mode, just stick to adventure mode man, your ideas would ruin what it‚Äôs meant to be. If you get killed then don‚Äôt respawn in the same location and you won‚Äôt get griefed, or come up with a strategy to take the sniper out. 
---
I fundamentally disagree with incurring a bounty for engaging in PvP in a PvP server, that‚Äôs ridiculous and it‚Äôs funny that you can‚Äôt see that. 
---
I‚Äôm done arguing with you, obviously we both have our beliefs, personally I think yours are trash and hope they never get implemented, but let‚Äôs shake hands and part as wasteland survivors, nothing more nothing less. 
---
No I understand that, my point is that it‚Äôs the most oddly shaped terrain and I don‚Äôt understand what could be placed there instead especially when it‚Äôs just drag away from the burning mine which is a very cool location.
---
@lvl 39 - did it for the first time last night.  
---
Failed the quest, but achieved my goal of acquiring a good number of miner suits to scrap so I can make excavator armor.
---
It was my safe and calm spot for a camp. Far from everything and everyone. And these fuckers spoiled it. I've spent months looking for this stop and weeks building it. Probably it will be the last drop for me. You don't change the damn map after release! Especially in a game, where camping is a thing! Bethesda idiots.
---
Why was this such an apparently requested feature?
---
I‚Äôve sent you a friend request, could you come to me.
---
Fucking run you commie bastard. lol ! 
---
Yeah the game is waaaaay better now than it was at launch. End game is still lacking, but there's incentive to play and trade with people 
---
Thanks for the reply, but I'm not using that perk. Though it does seem that the culprit is the adrenal reaction, but is it bugged or nerfed...
---
No legendary vendor until the end of May my fren.
---
The math on that is wrong, the explosive damage isn't "a lot" of it. It's only %25.
---
Lmao I do like the counter idea. (Or you BOS trying to start a war) Modus is the fucking man he got the missle silos rolling. He's nuking the shit out of the wasteland just because he can. He has a legion of soldiers and unknown hordes of robots. He could easily manufacture these. 
---
Also your've covering for the fact that Beth missed this opportunity to create something new and awesome. They totally could've been like we planned these since day 1 but we wanted to get them just right before we added them.
---
Yea thats what I mean, they arent placing any new location, they are most likely just adding a quest tied to the nearby locations or an event in that area, most likely tied to the burning mine
---
not sure i havent been on since the tse nerf. and it was the same for me. took on the queen 3 times in a span of 2 hours. 
---
Did u get them by breaking down equipment or what?  That's weird you have it for one arm and not the other I thought when u unlock armor mods they unlock for all limbs and then another time for the chest
---
I have all of the mutations you requested
---
Jesus Christ. Can no one read. Just read the damn road map! Read it! Don‚Äôt listen to what your idiot friend told you because he probably didn‚Äôt read it either.
---
Didn't the holotape in that room say something about getting part or something for it in Morgantown? Wonder if we can find it there someplace, plans or something.
---
We can meet at the Nukashine!...oh, wait...
---
found them.  under appliances.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about all the glowing meat too. I get over 150 steel scrap per run. Good event when I'm out of steel scrap
---
The TSE.  Although you're better off now with an AAE instead.
---
Oh yeah 100%. I'm just saying we need to either base our fear on few experiences or base our trust on many.
---
The nerf definitely brought down my damage values. My shotgun went from 1100 damage to 325 but the real difference is the amount of ammo i go through.
---
There was a thread yesterday where this was brought up and someone said everyone in his group checked the silo tapes and they looked good, but when they got to the launch pad the time was at 200+ hours.
---
Considering most other perks besides rifleman dont add that much damage, id say that its a lot of it chief. The perk itself says +60% therefore thats what I said
---
I'm no quitter!
---
In my Fallout4 settlements, I always found him hanging near the bars. Made sure to keep my eyes on him 
---
Yeah I think the rare mobs in this game drop literally the most underwhelming loot of rare mobs in any game, I've ever played.
---
I don't even bother hitting mothman or scorchbeasts.
---
What's the point ya know?
---
Idk why you're so salty bud with those downvotes. Good luck. 
---
Do you play a low health/high damage build?
---
same drop from 750 to 125 with tse handmade. i cried... 
---
How do?
---
Yeah, this is a Quadro M1000M... works just fine. But... wtf does that have to do with no audio? :)
---
Yeah, my handmade was similar. From around 425 to 126.
---
It‚Äôs my own fault really, the one time I try and build something outside of the forest and look what happens, ah well I guess I can try to relocate once I find some similar terrain 
---
No, its technically not adding resistance which is what shows up on the pip boy, its just mitigating damage, so from my experience I dont see it show and I have a full set
---
&gt; unfairly targetting all the people who had been hording for the upcoming player vending.
---
That seems like the whole pupose of the thing to me. Because it prevents people from flooding the market and inflating everything to make stuff dirt-cheap. If that were the case just buying whatever items you want would be a better way 100% of the time than actually playing the game and thats not a good way to go.
---
Awesome!gonna get piss drunk,see ya soon
---
Yeah, I run at about 20% health.  Primarily play as a bloodied rifleman, but use unarmed/one handed melee as a secondary option.
---
The cheese recipes would instantly become the most valuable commodity in the game. 
---
The strangler heart for Heart of the Swamp has been randomly disappearing and in one case, according to the map marker at least, relocated itself behind a wall in Ella Ames' bunker.
---
And don't know how much of this is from before or after but the quest Irrational fear is all sorts of messed up. The handy that starts it just sort of disappears at the start with its marker just sitting on the ground before finally showing up. None of the spawned enemies actually ever attack him, they just spawn and run up and stare at him. When moving between spawn triggers the handy will reach the destination and then turn around and retrace the path to the last trigger point before returning. And the quest can be completed on the final wave just by killing the crowned enemy no matter how many others are still alive. 
---
I‚Äôve tried to get the key many times and no luck so obviously this keys appearance is a random thing, do I keep server hopping, will the key appear?
---
Oh, tell me about it!
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
Enclave stashes would be a big Atom shop seller.
---
I'm a zit!
---
Lol yeah he picked the lock while I was working on some weapons and armor.
---
Legendary protections are suppose to randomly blow up some time after they are killed, that is not a glitch or anything, thats intended
---
I hear that but what Im Saying is putting protective in quote may seem like you are being sarcastic. Which is why you probably got downvoted. 
---
I've found it to be incredibly stable. 1 disconnect in probably 50 hours.
---
Try to let them destroy charlie extractor and focus on the other two. thats what I do. you really only need one excavator to survive to win it
---
it still doesnt work as of the patch released on march 13. just tried to repair and its not white bar repaired
---
What platform? 
---
Patch notes said something about reverting it to its original state. They also mentioned they fixed a bug that allowed you to double the bonus from adrenal reaction. My automatic vats critical build was similarly nerfed through a fix. Apparently keeping the trigger held during a critical hit to retain the bonuses for each shot is an exploit. It is pretty absurd if you ask me.
---
I am starting to suspect these bug/exploit fixes are intentional nerfs in disguise to avoid angering people like the TSE nerf.
---
I was playing Metro 2033 redux the other day and the womp womp sound of the flying things was just like scorchbeasts, and a little bit triggering. Just can't get away from it! 
---
I had to turn the voices slider way up to hear him well and then the robot at the other house blew out my ears.  So yeah.
---
I can‚Äôt really kill a scorch beast. I‚Äôm doing something wrong apparent. But, yes about Mothman 
---
Arms and legs are separate for limbs I believe. And no idea. I got the one from a shadowed arm. The other was originally a mod. 
---
Sure thing
---
Its a good XP grind. Theres also over 150 steel per run (without the scrapping perk card bonus) and every miner drops glowing meat.
---
No disconnects or  my game that freezes. So i am glad with this patch
---
Yeh your right, I've made a great build for less than 25k. Probably just shy of 20k. Power Armor means jack shit to me. 
---
By breaking down equipment! I've unlocked it for every part if you wish.
---
Was wondering this myself. Would think it's someplace in the beginning forest area. The thing that got my interest would be the items on the left corner of the shot. What are those? Looks kind of like a gas storage tank cabinet or something..?
---
I don't think the trailer Bethesda released yesterday is doing anyone any favors.  Yes, the road map spells it out, but if you missed that and just saw the trailer I can understand thinking all of that content was just added.
---
Yeah when ever I need steel I check the map and if the event isn't available the  I grudgely head to Grafton steel. 
---
the first time i killed a scorch beast i was level 34 and i killed it in a couple punches, it was just after i got the ghoulish card
---
the number of times i was killed by scorch beasts i couldnt kill before that, i didn't count. it was a lot
---
Found him, waited for him to insult me but nothing. Killed him and got the note.
---
It's probably tied to the underground areas shown in the trailer
---
You guys have a weird idea of "not hard to kill" 
---
That is correct. I have like 12 mutations and didn't feel like playing russian roulette with rad-away. In any case it does seem like they fixed it.
---
You're not missing out on much. A bit of ultracite and some meat. 
---
If they attack my camp I always log out. Some people have really specific specs and crazy strong weapons so it doesn't take them long to kill one.
---
Played about 5 hours yesterday over 2 different play session, no disconnects at all. Hell, it barely even stuttered during an SBQ fight with 10+ people smashing on her.
---
Sorry I meant the brick building set, I didn‚Äôt know what to call it at the time
---
I was just wondering I don't have anything right now but I just got the plans for arms and am trying to gets legs and chest too.  I broke down quite a few on another character and didn't unlock anything so wasn't sure if it was bugged or you had to buy it in steps like the linings of underarmor
---
PC
---
Are those rare? Got them on the first daily, ha. Trading them for a camp architect, they're gonna field all the materials to build me a nice farm with a still somewhere
---
I'm also having trouble finding a group for the new vault raids and prestiging my character, has this obvious bug been reported, or am I complete moron wasting everyone's time?
---
no, not much of a drinker myself, but if you start an Al-Anon group I might go to meetings...
---
WHY ARE WE YELLING?
---
Thanks for posting this, have been wondering where to look for those letter plans!
---
He insults hostiles. 
---
Where in the trailer shows "First section of Appalachia is available now"? It doesn't even try vaguely say, that everything you see in trailer isn't inside the game, even tho they advertise that expansion is out.
---
This is not common sense. Common sense is to state in trailer:"This is what is coming in Wild Appalachia expansion, that rolls out over 3 months". Does ESO releases its expansion or DLC in pieces and make trailer, what show all the parts even tho no all is coming in day one? No they don't. Even games that turn their expansion into pieces, doesn't show you all the pieces that are about to come and say "Available Now". WoW's this expansion is being release in parts (Like all their expansions?), did they show you all the raids in gameplay their trailer and then say "Available Now"? No they didn't. They showed you in feature trailers thing that are available in release day. They didn't show you dungeons and raids that aren't inside the game day one and then label the video "Available Now"
---
For food &amp; chems it's additive stacking on top of the perks, with a 90% cap. So with Travelling Pharmacy x2, stimpaks weigh 0.2 with one armor piece, and 0.1 with two or more pieces.
---
For weapon weight the pieces stack additively with each other, but multiplicatively with perks. If you have a weapon that weighs 5lb after perks then it'll weigh 3lb with two armor pieces. I'm not sure if there's also a hard cap.
---
Drop all the required materials into your stash or bring them all into your inventory. They have to be in the same storage space because of a bug. It's a hassle
---
It's your internet. 
---
Yikes. What platform was that?
---
No disconnects, did have a couple of instances last night where lap did not load after fast traveling.  
---
I really liked the bobblehead display you acquired in Fallout 4. I hope it's something similar in 76.
---
It has always done this from day one. You just noticed this now? Oooooookaaaaaay.... 
---
Nah it was perfect Bethesda humor. I've seen Animal House about 15 times and I'm only 28
---
No clue if they are rare or common not enough data to know, but seeing how letters are always rare they might be. 
---
Don‚Äôt think so I just tried to drink it without strong genes and I didn‚Äôt lost any mutation
---
Xbox
---
I logged in today and it said that I was in a no build zone. I was just across from the cat lady. However I just re-placed it in the same spot and it was fine.
---
you can do the social menu
---
SHUT THE FUCK UP, DONNY!
---
There are two places to attach the wire. If you attach the wire to the little switch it will open and close, but if you attach the power to the other side of the door (and it will let you) then it just stays open. Hope that helps?
---
yeah i noticed that too, you always have to click it twice to get it to stop, so its like the game remembers it was set to "off" but some bug keeps it playing...
---
and i also agree, if we could get another jukebox that plays other music hat would be great as well
---
Yesterday's patch added 2 new locations in Morgantown, which was alread packed with marked locations, so just because it's close to the Burning Mine doesn't mean they can't add another spot. 
---
As for the terrain, flattening it out is like world editing 101.
---
Good trade for me, I don't have to hassle with the end game... Camp building
---
Could they have possible been duped? Not saying you duped them but did you get them off someone else or organically?
---
At least they'd have something worth buying. I'm sitting on over 5K atoms (earned through gameplay) with nothing worthwhile to spend it on.
---
I noticed that as well and I run good with salt on all my chars 
---
yeah I've noticed that, too
---
SBQ should always count as a 3 star! And I'd make SB between 1 and 2 stars
---
Yeah you have a point there. Video editor made a mistake on that one. 
---
Is it a one time use item?
---
Nah.  I intend eventually to convert my pad into Appalachia's premier combination power armor garage/gun shop/package store.  Winning!
---
It shows you everything upcoming, you know, like every other expansion trailer in 2019? 
---
You have to be pretty dumb to believe that much content would release on day 1
---
PC.  That‚Äôs cool when random players jam together.
---
I got the smg from a drop but I traded with another player for the two shot gauss
---
I ruled the gpu and windows possible issues out with basic common sense as the driver I didnt have wasnt anything that would cause the type of problem I was reporting. It's a case of 1+2 could never result in 8. I had an 8 and they were asking me to check my math....
---
 Its like buying a computer and it showing up with no monitor and the support people tell you to plug in the tower and see if I can see a screen appear...  It simply wont as that even if broke, wouldnt cause the issue at hand.    I tested with other computers, other accounts and different characters.    
---
I've worked in these departments as well and know the drill in eliminating the obvious, which is why I appeased them and checked the driver even though I already did this before even contacting them. 
---
Different people also respond one after the other showing the revolving que they are using in which made my end of the conversation repetitive and extra annoying. I would just start to get one guy to comprehend the basic issue I'm explaining and have to start all over again, Repeating obvious points of the situation that were in the entire discussion history to begin with... Said all over again just in the hopes they finally actually read the text I sent.  After repeating myself a third or maybe it was forth time to yet another email guy after the previous had asked me if I would work with them to fix this after realizing it was a basic driver type issue I replied yes, but that I already did everything possible on my end and told him that, and all the sudden I get a new person replying and I have to start all over again.... /facepalm After already having explained the D/C error is due to the account being bugged on their end and not properly hand shaking while my camp is fetched to render due to the conflict in the new items implemented.
---
Eventually they said the "devs" are aware of this now and they cannot help me further through the support ticket, if I have more details to contact them (devs) directly using the report a bug feature.... 
---
So basically I'm locked out of my main character "hoping" they will eventually address the fact I can not use the only character i actually have invested my time into. Assuming the person I conversed with even forwarded the issue properly as said it took explaining the same problem 3-4 times until they finally read and comprehended the issue properly.
---
This wasn't just a "I cant login" or my shitz broke ticket message....  I explained what was occurring in detail with logs, also detailing what works and doesnt with multiple accounts and computers.  These points/observations/facts as stated negated it being a driver or port issue from message #1.  
---
The annoying part was having to repeat myself till they actually read the original message.... Only to basically find out Support isnt really support but just email relays which I should have assumed to begin with. If i was speaking to an actual developer the conversation would have been MUCH shorter.
---
It was annoying to have to update a driver which wastes my time further as well as fucks up my other games just to confirm to them they broke their own shit which any entry level test would confirm with a simple login attempt on their end.  If they did as I said initially and read what I had said they would have spent less time dealing with me to get the same results all together.   Instead they wasted my time and theirs and I'm still in the same boat and so is the faulty code.
---
I've worked in support for T-A company's, the reason I dont anymore is exactly this type of stuff. I was not happy having to lie to fellow gamers, wasting their time, or outright having to point blame onto them for issues we knew the products we covered were responsible for. It made me feel dirty and they sure as hell didnt pay enough for me to live like that.   Example is when a large batch of Guitar Hero peripherals were knew for a fact to be a massively defective reached the hands of thousands of players, we were swarmed with complaints and issues and the half dozen of us were over whelmed. We were told by the department head to just lie and of course copy/paste some bullshit trouble shooting responses to weed down the amount of traffic as most people would just give up and never contact us about it again, and at all costs we were to never admit we had known we had sold faulty equipment.  It wuld "cost" too much.... and sadly I bet some of you bought some of them too.
---
  I dont blame the support staff personally, they are forced to handle so many messages per day they cant give each situation the time required especially with this game as it has been, and that's exactly the problem outside of the problem I was contacting them regarding to begin with. 
---
SO I wasted my time playing email tag, updating drivers and rolling them back just to confirm what i already knew and here i am still locked out of my character, NOT account or ability to load the game/servers, play, or stay connected to the game. (Just the main CHARACTER that is bugged as I had explained to them at the least 3 times and possibly as many as 6 times overall.) 
---
Sorry for the book here, as I have yet to sleep as I was up all night "trouble shooting" and explaining a simple problem and I'm half in the bag now.
---
I guess what I mean is it's 60% of the 20% (of the base damage) which ends up not being too much damage for 5 perk cards (12%) but I always forget Two-shot gets two explosions
---
FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT!!!!!!!!!!
---
That second projectile explodes though so I don't think that's accurate
---
When I server hopped the first time after logging in, I saw a nuke zone over near prime. I fast traveled to the drop site and boom - disconnected. Bleh.
---
Ive seen posts showing that tse still does more damage, but nothing is confirmed I feel like 100%
---
About 20 people day 1. Lots of excitement.
---
yeah that's great and all but fo76 isn't an MMO
---
Yea for me without the 5 perks my tse lever is useless 
---
That is true but that‚Äôs not going to be a core part of gameplay for most high level players. Once they add more endgame activities people aren‚Äôt going to chose to help out lower level people when they have content at their level they can complete. 
---
Maybe a compromise would be to have it tied to the prestige levels that way there would be a level range of 1 to 50 for each server and that cooperation could still happen. 
---
I had a hell of a time camp crafting last night. Continually had to go in/out of camp mode, as well as dashboarding several times. Right there with you, amigo 
---
This is indeed a bold strategy.
---
Hey, if you got some joy from it, and this is a personal thank you to black/white/grey "hats," that's cool. Feel your feelings.
---
That being said? Not seeing any hard evidence that duplication exploits "saved" anything. This feels like a misguided narrative at best, and is certainly a list of opinions presented as a fact. 
---
Is it the same as the atom shop music? There's 3 different atom shop songs.. can't seem to find anything else that fits the description. Unfortunately I don't have access to the game to find out which song you mean exactly, I'm going off guessing. I suppose I could lookup someone doi g the event and go from there. 
---
I don't believe so.
---
I've seen several comments from people who checked the holotape and saw the countdown timer at 0:00, but when they got to the bottom of the silo the timer was at 200+ hours.
---
There's also no consistency to it, because other people have launched nukes.
---
Yes my camp could not be placed and i joined a new server. Must be where we differed.
---
Thanks for the great update! I'd suggest looking at the plasma gun. Because it does 2 types of damage, it's really ineffective. It seems like this weapon was intended to be more powerful than the laser rifle but it's actually much weaker. Players don't use them for endgame. 
---
I was actually hoping for a Legendary Varient of a drill. I really want a Stalkers drill the VATS AP cost is killing me. /s
---
It is not like you are short on caps. You travel whole day by fast traveling and you don't even feel its affect on purse.

---
I'm PS4, same thing happens all the time
---
i did get booted from a server last night in the middle of a nuke zone, was pissed
---
on ps4
---
That makes sense, you either have to remove the drinks via your stash or wait until they ferment there... if you hopped immediately to another server you wouldn't have had this issue.
---
I‚Äôve started a collection in my CAMP for the last week in preparation for this update lol. 
---
I got mine from speaking to the robobrain and completing his Daily Quest.
---
Ah, I‚Äôll give it a try.
---
I have full light BoS combat armour (all either weightless or chameleon), like others said it's kinda up to you, but there's probably some types of armours better than others.
---
Nuke cool-down is 200+ hours if you launched a nuke before the patch. 
---
I launched my last nuke Monday night, and I had a 175 hour cooldown timer preventing me from launching another   
---
It‚Äôs been fine up until this point though l. Is that really a coincidence? Everything else seems fine 
---
Crops seem to mature mach faster now. At least my razorgrain did.
---
I believe they are one of the rewards that can drop from doing the dailies for the wanna-be Bender (lol)
---
I actually never have a problem with mine. The base of it is the staircase single tile combo and it works great. Have moved 4 times
---
It's either a gun with a recon scope or the targeting HUD mod on your power arm.
---
I had a 1x1 "floating" CAMP that I couldn't place last night either. Couldn't explain why.  Ended up building a new one.
---
No problem
---
This wasn't E3 trailer.
---
Things would be so much better if they just fixed everything wrong with the game 
---
Where did you buy your copy of FO76 from?  If it was not from Bethesda,  did you at any point ask for a refund? Do you have the transaction, (receipt,  bank stmt, credit card trans #)?
---
Barrens chat &gt; fo76 community
---
?
---
It definitely can be a great thing. It‚Äôs helped for taking workshops when people were more focused on the other side, but I‚Äôve also had it where level 100+ players have taken over all the starter area workshops. 
---
I am in the same situation. I loaded up my Fermenter last night with 10 things to ferment and went to bed. Got up this morning to join a friend to help him make a T-45 set, and when I joined my CAMP could not be placed. However, I wanted to be on that server because my friend was there, so I chose to stay. Was on the server for about 30 minutes, and then quit to the main menu. Tried to join another server, and DCed. I did not take any alcohol or anything from my aid tab, in fact I may not have even accessed the Aid tab, only the main tab, Misc tab, and Junk tab. However, crafting PA stuff pulled materials from my stash, and I put some Junk and Misc items back in to load it back up to 800 after I was done. But I didn't transfers in or out of Aid. So, I didn't do your step #4, but did all the rest. I'm going to file a support ticket now. My alt account still plays, but main is hosed.
---
Even if duped, it shouldn't have just disappeared.
---
Yeah like internet providers suck sometimes and have slow downs that can cause stuff like this. Try rebooting the Xbox and wifi. 
---
I need to re-verify a few of these, but because I haven't seen them announced at all, I'm assuming they're still broken.
---
[There was a good post some time ago by another user](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad7fxu/enclavescout_armor_all_you_need_to_know_about_it/) that effectively covered most of this, but I haven't seen it brought up in a while and wanted to see if it's on the radar.
---
Summary Urban/Forest Scout Armor:
---
* Urban Scout Armor Left Arm has low/incorrect stats.
---
* Neither set can drop as legendaries.
---
* Most mods are indistinguishable if it's arm/leg/chest.
---
* Arm/Leg specific (Lining_LimbArm / Linging_LimbLeg) mods are broken but generic "Limb" (Lining_Limb) mods work fine.
---
Ah came across him, but no insults, says he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòworking‚Äô or something. Didn‚Äôt think to shoot him.
---
Well, that's "decor".
---
Jesus, is it possible it was a mod and I simply remember it as "stock FO4"? In any event, it was awesome:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/1490
---
Agreed, the load times are about 20% longer.
---
Same
---
Or just build your house on a resource spot and your own.  I found a spot with two, barely need junk anymore.
---
Agreed, the load times are about 20% longer for me in Patch 7.

Aluminum can here, aluminum can there... Finally, enough Aluminum!

Always running out.in-game, but go to the store, or just walk down a neglected road... Aluminum for days

1600 cap/20 hours?!?!?! Haha try 1600 in 10 minutes. Hit the higher lvl players in pvp. In 1 hour last night I made 4000+ from 2 players. I wasn't griefing I have two workshops I use for lead and steel, so I took them. The currency isn't broke, the players are. 
---
No kidding, that‚Äôs where it comes from?
---
thx..i did the fertile soil event so many times..but i notice the icon at whitespring for the ghouls at first i thought it was because they were legendaries but that is not the case
---
Gonna go with option B, but also, yes it has been (stupidly) reported.
---
plasma "gooified" they still have the infinite loot load bug rendering them all unlootable. :-/  
---
So all plasma weapons are still useless :-/  
---
I haven't used a flamer yet in this game but the Wild Appalachia trailer shows a flamer at [1:47](https://youtu.be/CIZ-LGaRB6M?list=PL9RuW_6cAHni5LPEjwqhr0397EyB3Cyid&amp;t=107) and it appears the player is aiming up at a Mirelurk Queen and the arc is pretty long before he connects and starts hitting the Queen, compare that to [1:40](https://youtu.be/CIZ-LGaRB6M?list=PL9RuW_6cAHni5LPEjwqhr0397EyB3Cyid&amp;t=100) where the player aims it level and the range appears to be halved and it appears arcing does extend the range...
---
I can confirm food/thirst refil is notablly less than it used to be, it took 6 pure waters to fully fill my water meter, when it used to be about 4 to do so, glowing meat steaks also used to restore alot more food than they do now (I had to eat like 6 of them for a half meter)
---
Decay wise, not sure if it's faster, but depletion/gain are notably tweaked
---
They pop up fairly often as event rewards, so go claim workshops and do their defense events. If nothing else, you'll start earning enough caps to buy them.
---
If you claim a power plant and collect the fusion cores you can sell them on /r/fo76bazaar for 100 caps each. The processor creates 8/hour, so it shouldn't take too long.
---
Even if they just cleaned outside Charleston Fire Department, there‚Äôd be plenty of room for a small market in an area most new players reach fairly quickly.
---
Exactly, welcome to my thread kind sir 
---
Aahh i see. Well that makes sense. At least we know it can be avoided by just joining another server.
---
I just made a post about not carrying enough food because it spoils. Start carrying more and it all went bad and I starved to death on a roof again.
---
I have a question for God.
---
#Why?
---
Ok. Thank you for the tip, I‚Äôll give it a go :)
---
I thought maybe the bot stops would give is robot companions. Until the enclave missions. 
---
we have all seen the utilitarian and practicle one square foundation builds, but if you want to blueprint literally anything else it almost never wants to place...
---
Okay serious this time. Is this the link you are looking for?
---
https://youtu.be/Q3lDY0zqFbM
---
This is exactly why I use a single foundation CAMP, which I used to be able to blueprint and move without problems. 
---
Haven't played the new update yet, but you used to be able to put a plant half on/half off a rug in the dirt, and then pick up the rug and the plant with it. Has that been patched also?
---
If that's the case, the new adrenal reaction damage values start at below 50% health, not 80-90% like it did before. Max damage should still be the same at 10% now, not at 20%. 
---
If you had a total of 112 DR, you would take 22% less ballistic damage than with 65 DR.
---
This sounds like you're talking about a single piece of armor though. Armor DRs are added up over the whole set, and a difference of (for example) 347 DR vs 300 DR would be only 5.5% ballistic damage reduction. That's why pure damage reduction pieces are so powerful, regardless of quality.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox as well. Though the worlds have been spawning a little funky today, I haven‚Äôt been kicked it disconnected from a session....yet. 
---
I sure hope party boy works with nuka shine and other vintage alcoholic drinks... It would be absurd for them not to! If someone wants to be a one-shot monster killer for 60 seconds with a risk of blacking out and fast travelling in pvp then it sounds like the game is working as intended.
---
They come out in May, I think? Possibly April but I think May. Regardless, not this month.
---
Place a rug on the ground, not on a floor, the actual ground. Plant crops as close as possible to the edge of the rug. If you get them in the right spot they'll be attached to the rug when you try to move it. If not, keep fiddling with them until they stick. Move the rugs somewhere else inside your house.
---
Vault 94... I found it. Is it new or old thing?
---
Thanks for that. I did finally discover that after an hour or so of frustration. The place that was blue printed was really  built for where i was originally,so i had to rebuild from scratch. Roughly the same design,but a bit smaller and some design changes to take into account the new landscape. I just hate having to re-wire the thing for the power. Lol. Just mostly peeved at having to move in the first place as i had been there since the first week of the games release and i came across the spot and really,really liked it and found it perfect. Ah,well.
---
I will check
---
Sorry for thinking Bethesda came and took it. 
---
yeah, and it works mostly, but I shouldn't have to make an unrealistic single foundation base just so I can move my camp, let alone blueprinting (part of) it...
---
LOUD NOISES
---
**As creepy as in game!**
---
Workaround: Campfires. You can plant crops in campfires and place campfires on "floor" pieces.
---
I'll tell you right now, I'd grief the shit outta you.
---
Steel is literally everywhere in 76 and if you're running low you can wear your excavator armor to Garrahan and come out with 100+ steel easy. (Or heck literally any industrial building and pick up all the canisters and wrenches you see.) Plus there are other places like Watoga where the bots also drop steel AND much more useful and rare metals like lead and aluminum PLUS they drop level 50 legendaries and if you've done mayor for a day they don't even attack you. I just don't see the point of marching a mile into the deepest reaches of a man-made cave and taking dozens of level 40 mole miners just so you can farm mediocre suboptimal legendaries and literally THE most common material in the game.
---
Because it's one of the few faction vendors that didn't have a stash box. Phoenix doesn't have one either, but it's like a 30 second walk to the train station so it's not such a big deal.
---
They come out in a different patch. I think it said they come out around the 23rd or so
---
Possible joking aside, they already did have different spoil rates for things.  Raw Flux spoiled much faster than food stuffs.
---
But... I don't have any hard numbers to compare before patch to after patch.  Everything is just "Feels" for now and I cannot tell if it's just because I spent 4 hours running around doing Brewing quests and gathering ingredients and I didn't realize how much time I was spending doing stuff.
---
I can't wait till I can kill the Scorchbeast Queen without the game crashing.  Oh that's right.  I just tried too and it crashed again.  Well thankfully I haven't been able to loot the last 4 Queens I helped kill and I was really happy it ate all my ammo resources for literally nothing.  Like really happy.  
---
And the fluctuating excavator weight on login.  
---
And Endless loot loading in nuke zones. 
---
Aaaand no one at Bethesda is can or will do anything about it. 
---
But that's ok because the online store has been updated constantly since launch.  That humor is almost as black as the Fallout universe itself.
---
what i'd give for plants to actually go in the ground

Who‚Äôs there?

This aggression will not stand, man.

The main thing I want now is a type writer at my desk, toilet paper and a towel in my bathroom, and flowers, a black bowl, raw meat, and cultist dagger at my shrine to our Moth and Savior.

Knowing my luck I will just get a lactose intolerance debuff.

But you will get fertilizer regularly till the debuff wears off.

I did not know this.  Wow ok.  Do you know how much 
---
For me, the lemonade vendor (I found him in Cranberry Bog) shared the same cap pool as Watoga station.
---
There's the "Missile Silo Holotape" available for sale in the Enclave Bunker.  Buy it, check it.  The game already solved for this in a way that works
---
My two shot gauss with reduced weight is a trophy piece in my collection. Legacy weapon that no longer exists (at least for now). I turned down a 10k offer.

Well, that was pretty stupid on my part, but you get what I‚Äôm saying. ;)

Details on build?

Git gud gear!!

I was just letting you know.
---
They knocked the numbers of mass duplicated items to 1. So even if you did get a dupe from a shop, you'd still have it.
---
Can I steal this love note? Or can I sign it next to your name and make it a twofer? I'm cheap and don't want to make my own.

Does fallout76cusom.ini need something to change, this time.
---
This time I dropped constantly under the ground and spawning again in the air and again dropped outside gaming area again and it repeated until i removed my mods.
---
Oh. I don't care about clout or karma. I got my point across and people can interpret it how they wish. If that's how they see it, then they might be part of the problem also. When you assume.... You know the rest. 
---
The thing is Mirelurk Queens and Behemoths should probably be dropping better loot as well. All of them dropping legendaries or plans should be the route they go.
---
Seems pretty hard to cripple their wings, even with tormentor
---
have another player kill you.
---
GameInformer is owned by GameStop, fuck both of them...
---
Hey. I‚Äôm with the Operation Tourniquet discord. Most of our members are having trouble with their first or second nukes after the patch. Could you tell us if either of you ever used glitches to exit the map, or had the game glitch to put you out of the map, especially in the silos? 
---
I am anticipating a deeply religious experience tonight. 
---
Does this thing talk?
---
How did you think players would contest for ownership? Pie eating contest minigame?
---
I‚Äôve made this and it reminds me of Pepsi with lime. It‚Äôs actually not that bad.
---
Put your stash in stash box then don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
Are you talking about BIV? Yesterday i unlocked the crafting benches.
---
Today he just give a new alcohol recipe and 50 caps....
---
Are those rewards random?
---
Could you have pressed r accidentally (maybe as you pressed t)? Ive lost 2 high tier guns to this, so its definately possible.
---
I largely agree about the perk cards. They‚Äôre overrated. My quad double barrel shotgun gets the job done despite no perks and my handmade isn‚Äôt all it‚Äôs rumored to be despite having perks. I appreciate that the current balance allows experimentation.... when the guns work. I‚Äôm eagerly awaiting seeing what my instigating assaultron head will do. 
---
Are you using mods? Some of them can break your strings if they edit text and the game updates. 
---
The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man.
---
To answer your question, it has been patched
---
In all I dont blame them personally but yes it was annoying jumping through hoops just to prove I wasnt some blithering idiot trying to stick a square peg in a round hole.   
---
Now I have no idea if ever i will access this character again, as they stated Bethesda support itself can not help me further through their system and I have no idea if they really are even looking into this properly. I can only hope one day I can magically access this account when they discover the poor code.
---
Put all your scrap in your stash box, and strip down to your underwear. Then hang out in Whitesprings. Someone will take of you. None of your armor gets damaged and you lose no scrap. 
---
I've done this many times.
---
See I had to directly NOT complete it. The amounts were insanely high anyway. But if they were going for realism they nailed it because I now have to run around completing quests drunk and with my friends
---
Awe nuts. I was really hoping for an alcoholic sneaky sniper build with some of these other drinks like firecracker whiskey
---
People have them for sale. They range from 1.5k to 2.5k which is a heck of a lot less than the 10k+ vendor bots sell them for. 
---
I think they were duped so the plans aren‚Äôt widely advertised. 
---
I figured. Those builds seem to be the only way to get crazy damage like that
---
&gt;This is how a base should look...
---
that's subjective...  I don't want my base to look like a prison...
---
Same here -- discovered it with this character, in fact. She was in the middle of a heated card game between some teddy bears and a garden gnome. The gnome had a judging expression, so she shot him in the face.
---
The lemonade vendor appears to be a Random Event at places where random events can occur.
---
And he seems to share pool with other existing vendors.  As others have reported in a few topics already.
---
The issue is that you picked it up meaning you "acquired" it. Acquiring that much ammo within a 30 day period is apparently "suspicious" and grounds for a ban. It's all in their scripting. The worst part is they clearly aren't looking into it and don't care because none of the people wrongly banned have been allowed access again.
---
I haven't tested other new alcohols maybe some will work
---
Alright thanks!
---
hahaha - back when the world was a simpler place.

Not that I‚Äôve seen. I FINALLY got it from doing treasure maps.

Clearly you are just worried about getting attention and people agreeing with you rather than fixing the problem, or figuring out what the actual problem is.

YES! I friggin‚Äô HATE that!!!

Have to have razorgrain to farm adhesive otherwise I‚Äôd say screw it. If I could just constantly harvest Silva Homestead (if my camp was closer to there) I‚Äôd scrap the 4 bushes I have.

 [2073](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline#2073). As [China](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/China) became increasingly aggressive with their use of  
---
 biological weapons, the [United States](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/United_States)  government felt that a countermeasure was needed. The Pan-Immunity  Virion Project (PVP) was officially formed September 15, 2073.   
---
 [2075](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline#2075).  It became clear that the best way to combat the newly created  biological weapons was to alter uninfected DNA so that it was no longer  susceptible to standard viral infection.  
---
 [2076](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline#2076).  Unforseen side effects began surfacing in early 2076 with the PVP.  Animal test subjects began showing an abnormal growth rate accompanied  by increased brain activity.   
---
The U.S. government took notice of these discoveries, and in the  interests of national security, moved a team on-site to secure and  oversee the project, which was now dubbed the FEV ([Forced Evolutionary Virus](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Forced_Evolutionary_Virus)) project.  
---
[2077](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline#2077).  FEV nears completion. Test on lab animals are at a near 100% success  rate. Size and muscle density increase approximately 60%, and the  protential intelligence increase by 200%.  
---
Effects upon human subjects remain unknown; although they are theoretically promising.  
---
The military, wishing to continue further testing, builds a  large facility at the Mariposa military installation in central  California. At this new facility, testing of the FEV virus continues on  volunteer subjects from the military.

I posted this to warn people about grabbing everything by either hitting Y fast or selecting everything without looking first.

Second is that if someone does pick up something, what then? How do they get rid of it or turn it in? 
---
Dumping it I guess didn‚Äôt work...
---
I also forgot to mention I had a tree that when building would disappear allowing me to place a foundation or work bench, then as soon as I placed the item it would reappear clipped through. Had to get rid of a whole row of foundations cause I did not want a tree growing through my camp and bedroom. Lol. 
---
I'm sad to see that even though you liked the game, you stopped playing it because of how forcefully other people disliked it. However I'm glad to see you're back. Don't let the mob tell you what you can and cannot enjoy. They are all just jealous because they can't handle someone enjoying a new Fallout game that their YouTube overlords forbid them from playing.

Dmg per shot was increased by 10-20%, even more for weapons that had fire rate reduced. To make it easy we can say dps was increased by 10-20%
---
I found my graphics settings went to uktra and caused me long loading times and many crashes. Put it back to high with a little bit of medium mixed in and everything got better.

PVP cap rewards are based on Level, and are separate from Bounties.  Mutual PVP is not penalized.

30 pounds isn't enough for some weapons....

Oh ok thanks for clarifying 
---
Ran into this after the last patch.  I stopped using blueprints for this reason.  Now i just move it and it just stores the whole CAMP and seems fine. 
---
I still need to replant my plants and place water purifiers but it brings them all and no blueprints.  Seems to work ok so far.

TNT Dome?  I'm lost.  What's a TNT Dome?

personally im more interested in the dome and how to get in, searched near the new vault nothing all around the domes and nothing

will be trying near the fraternity area next in hopes of clues on where to get the key

What spawn event? I've only ever done the Charleston one and was able to get the Spacesuit I wanted. You don't have to give me all the details, just something I could google. Thanks dude.
---
Well damn.
---
I run into this quite often actually. Pan your camera up and down near the bottom or even under where you want to place the wall. Sometimes you will notice the area to grt it to flip is very small.

Alternatively remove the piece of floor behind where you want the OUTSIDE of the wall to face.

Their parents took em to the bottom of the mines. Wrapped them in miner gear. Then the bombs dropped and killed everyone but the babies. They grew up and their soft baby skulls fused to the miner gear. 
---
They had on elders so they grew up like lord of the flies. Creating their new infant society without language or writing. 
---
Sorry about the late response it was late last night and I just got home. Unfortunately something is going on with my internet I‚Äôll let you know once I can get on to do the trade. My gt is giokiwi but if you happen to get the plans from some else feel free to. 
---
Gambling.
---
And maybe other shit.
---
But definitely gambling.
---
Rtdosen was his Reddit name. I don‚Äôt recall the Gamertag. It was 5 days ago. I don‚Äôt know if he has more or not. Also I paid 2.5k, not 2k. 
---
This is not a real location yet. It has a vending machine in it which has not been released yet.
---
Yeah, damage output is pretty phenomenal.  The drawback is if something sneezes too hard in my direction, I'm pretty well done for.
---
I left plenty of space lol
---
"works just fine"
---
Yeah, clearly. 
---
Touching items doesnt matter as I know I didnt touch mine whatsoever and I'm locked out for that char. To be safe just do not play on a server that cannot spawn your base.
---
That‚Äôs a bug. Some other people have had the same problem. 
---
PC user, he was super quiet for both me and my wife.
---
Yes, rewards are random.  Keep completing them to get more recipes, or apparently the Greek Letters.
---
Ah...thanks. 
---
yeah, that's a bug, *each* critical hit takes the full bar, if you are getting multiple crits with one bar it's a bug
---
I have 1 piece of chameleon armor equipped.
---
Another for health regen when not in combat.
---
The rest of my armor is tailored for melee, using light or ultra light builds if I can can.
---
I‚Äôll the plants need to be set lower and should have a portion go through the ground.  I mean, they are in dirt, not your second floor... so make it longer then it needs to be devs!
---
Definitely there.
---
My camp isn‚Äôt too far from there. Not sure to build up defenses or scout for new locations. 
---
WHAR BACKPACK? WHAR?
---
So. Wait the people I hunt as the main centerpiece of my time in f76 were innocent sometimes?
---
I feel less righteous now.
---
Welcome to the club my man. We should have a 'were screwed' party.
---
I would hazard a guess it's related to the next update when we will be hunting down some rare beast(s), and is just a minor change made prior, like the addition of the new vault door, and changes made to the other doors (which I believe have been said to all have rock walls placed behind them, instead of their old zone entrance).
---
I don't see this happening any time soon. This would destroy the individuality of unique builds. Some would tell you it'd be easier to start a new character and plan your build from the get-go. Also perk packs are completely RNG, it doesn't take into account perks you already have. I've gotten Hacker 3 times now. 
---
Yeah, happens to a lot of people I guess, kinda disappointed 
---
No. Players need to make their own. Like some have been doing. That's the idea behind this game. 
---
if you hae a mission to clear enemied from (location), the diamond marks them.
---
Maybe next time play the game and come to your own opinion of the game instead of letting people dictate what you should do.
---
got it thanks
---
I think it's because it comes off a little defensive, as if I'm accusing you of something. I was just adding to the reference, there was no need for you to explain your comment unless you somehow got the impression that I was trying to correct you or something. And the elipses at the end makes it sound passive aggressive, like you're implying I did something wrong adding to the list.  
---
I didn't downvote you, just an explanation
---
Yeah, don‚Äôt feel bad. Your doing us a favor actually. But a lot of people do end up with bounties for reasons they can‚Äôt explain.
---
That's not a good spot. To hard for lower levels to get to. 
---
Also, we should be making our own player hubs. Like the farmers markets people have been doing.
---
It appears you may not have any control over this. Just using the Fermenter and accessing stash at all might cause this glitch, even if you do not add or removing anything from the Aid tab in your stash. See my reply here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ytb6/game_breaking_fermenter_bug_do_not_do_this/eija0oz/
---
Right there with you. I know for a fact I didnt remove or touch the items 'cookin' but stayed on the server that couldnt place my camp.  Our best guess currently is while we were playing our drinks finished cooking which changed the items status, triggering the bug just like manually moving it would do.   
---
Help I‚Äôm having the same issue too. My first house built pre update worked great then the update hit and then it gave me the error. I stored it and rebuilt a 2x2 1 level home with just a bed and a tinker and weapons bench. Now when I go to place it, it give me the same error. I‚Äôm praying for a fix 
---
On the PC, I am lvl 31 with no addons etc (never have had). I cant aim with a scoped Recon True Sniper Rifle - right mouse button doesnt do anything
---
Tried remapping right mouse button with no joy.
---
You can close that hole with two trapezoid shaped wall pieces and two short walls. It leaves you with a chimney shape which you can then choose to close off with a flat roof piece. I can show you a picture from my base if you're having trouble finding that piece.
---
Can't even see the KidSecure ID in my inventory. Tried moving all the necessary materials into my inventory from stash box and it's still greyed out. I've tried logging out and back in too with no luck. Is it possible the last patch bugged this even more?
---
It existed since the cold war not made by vault-tec 
---
Yeah, I don't think it's him, but whoever voiced Biv was definitely inspired by Bender.
---
I read this post last night, so I was aware of this problem. I was careful to never add/remove anything from my stash from the Aid tab.
---
Nonetheless, I am in the same situation and it is not due to anything I did. I loaded up my Fermenter last night with 10 things to ferment and went to bed. Got up this morning to join a friend to help him make a T-45 set, and when I joined my CAMP could not be placed. However, I wanted to be on that server because my friend was there, so I chose to stay. Was on the server for about 30 minutes, and then quit to the main menu. Tried to join another server, and DCed. I tried several times, in and out of a team to join a server, and always DCed. I cannot join any server now.
---
I did not add or remove anything from my aid tab, in fact I may not have even accessed the Aid tab, only the main tab, Misc tab, and Junk tab. However, crafting PA stuff pulled Junk materials from my stash, and I put some Junk and Misc items back in to load it back up to 800 lbs after I was done. So, I didn't do your step #4 (add/remove alcohol from the stash that may have been in the fermenters), but did all the rest of the steps.
---
FYI, my alt account still plays, but main is hosed.

My ticket #190314-004781
---
/u/Ladydevann this is terrible: I can't play on my main character and cannot make any caps offering services or trading. I'm completely shut down. Can you please make this a top priority and provide us regular updates here (or somewhere)? Where's the best place to stay tuned for updates? I pressed the subscribe button on the page -- is this the best option?https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/45572/kw/disconnected
---
The new drink recipes have some crazy effects. On I saw was just a flat 15 percent incease for ballistic gun damage
---
Is your stash full? It uses stash space - up to 10 pounds of the 800 if you have it available. 
---
I'm sure creating your own hub wherever is what they currently have planned. But having a localised hub where players can congregate would be great for this game. Many MMOs do it, and although it's not an MMORPG, it would greatly enhance the community interaction. 
---
Yeah haha I had this happen for me also, was so sad when all that was there, was Molerats XD
---
When you are in an area that you have to clear out, like a workbench area, all the enemies you have to get rid of are tagged like that.
---
Came to say this. I'm heavily into ballistic weapons; I'm based on a lead deposit with another lead seam up on the hill; I swoop down into town to get caps, gunpowder, and scrappable steel weapons from supermutants then go back to my base, harvest veggies and water for adhesive, and make ammo for the evening's adventures. Yesterday's update gave me brahmin milk on top of it to wash down my mutant hound steaks. My mini workshop costs me nothing and gives me almost everything i need.
---
It does make things harder exploring alone. Like I'm trying to head to Top of the World at level 15 and there's level 30 mole miner supervisors.
---
You bet it does. 
---
Had a dozen of the same plans on me, the ones around the Volunteer Church. Would always loot for food after hunting bounties in the area.
---
Dropped them all for a mew player.
---
Wonder if he still has them.
---
I had my opinion, its a beautiful game. 
---
To clarify, I stopped because all my friends stopped and I had nobody to play with anymore.
---
All those negative critics and YouTubers was a bit like a brainwash that the game is maybe really bad 
---
thanks, for the explanation and not downvoting
---
I think they patched it.
---
Simple solution: don't do the Horde Events in the newbie areas and the loot will be better. Horde events in the the Forest gives lvl 5-15 loot. Ash heap and middle map gives mid lvl loot. If you do Horde Events in the east part of the map you will get lvl 45-50 loot instead. 
---
I'll just set off my siren.  So keep your ears open :P
---
I suppose I assumed that leaving myself in pacifist mode meant I would not be able to defend the workshop, and would simply have to abandon it, or switch off pacifist mode.
---
The real issue is the total lack of information on the game mechanics from Bethesda, I even have the $30 Book, which is of very little value with it's limited explanations, and all the changes that were made Post release.
---
Yes, many people.
---
Yeah unfortunately I‚Äôve gotten too many duplicates from these packs. 
---
This one hit a little too close to home.
---
Got a plastic spoon from a 3* legendary bloated ghoul. Probably the same spoon that made it fat and bloated. 
---
Didn't notice myself.  As soon as the update hit I equipped good with salt to gather razorgrain lol
---
Thanks man I‚Äôll check him out 
---
This is correct. Also, if you connect a terminal to it you can [set all switches to On] and the gate will remain open until you enter the code. 
---
Thanks man, the 7% extra is huge for me, if I‚Äôm carrying over a 1000 nuka colas that 7% is more than 70 carry weight!
---
That is a good build but yes, glass does begin to explain how fragile it is. I'm trying to unlock perk cards so if I wanted to I could switch to that build. Personally I'm a T51 Tank Build
---
I would love to see them add "communities" or "guilds" or something similar where players can be matched together more often. 
---
Just last night, my wife and I started new characters and met an awesome dude who had his camp nearby. We added each other as friends, but it would be much better to just be put in a server with familiar people to build community. 
---
The current retail version of WoW has this same issue with phases and sharding. You never see the same person twice, and that is a big drag on community and a feeling of persistence in a world. 
---
I recently moved and I can't place stuff on campfires anymore
---
I mean, I was maybe in my teens the first time I listened to the radio signal for the Top of the World, if you do the main quest it's only right after the Responders portion...
---
Curious, another player mentioned it before too.  And the OP of this topic asked, but I lost the comment in the mass here.
---
Did you have a drink fermenting in the Fermenter when you logged out?  The OP had wondered if it "maturing" in your Stash and being automatically removed from the Fermenter queue while the Fermenter did not "exist" counted the same as removing it manually?
---
Would sort of make sense that the bug is related to the Fermenter being utilized while the Fermenter doesn't exist.  Either by manual or automatic systems.
---
Run in fullscreen not windowed.
---
Where did you get these at?? Is it a event or just on bodies. 8f a event name location plzs 
---
Same problem
---
What's a prime receiver?
---
They probably added creation club content.  
---
The Sunday brother's place has a new brewing station as well
---
&gt;Thanks for the assistance, ill try out what your post offers, and if i get the same issue ill report back to you my friend!
---
I befriended a rad stag, hangs out at my house.  Sometimes it is glowing..sometimes not... sometimes he attacks my walls but does no damage...but still it's something lol
---
Well besides the significant percentage of players are reporting 200 hour reload times for muke silos.
---
Oh and then there's the whole, if you're brewing something and get disconnected and end up in the next server without your camp and leave you're account will be permanently inaccessible, thing.
---
 And considering Bethesda individual player support I'd expect it to be like that for at least a month.
---
But besides the game breaking glitches... All good
---
What if one of us is Sierra Petrovita's great great ... great grandparent?
---
It was in the savage divide
---
I didn't see it posted. 
---
Someone please make a meme, first panel is drinking Nuka Shine and passing out, second Panel Skyrim "You're finally awake"
---
This ain‚Äôt runescape 
---
Thanks for your reply.
---
I have 100 pounds of free space.
---
I did notice while checking inventories that I can't drop items either.  I can move stuff from inventory to stash and back without a problem.
---
Glitch.
---
Yup, mini workshops are the best, no need to contest.
---
In game I role play as Sierra the crazy Nuka-Cola lady. 
---
I got this message on my PS4 too! I just shut down the application and started back up and it worked 
---
Huh
---
BTW....The silo slate list holo tape....apparently dosen't work for this. Mine all say 0 hours, untill i actually complete the launch prep.....THEN it tells me about the 30 hour cool down time remaining.
---
They didn't add just 1 drink. You can complete 1 quest a day for a new recipe at Biv.
---
I had a look around my camp and didn‚Äôt see any bags but it could have fell through the floor 
---
You‚Äôve had Whitesprings all this time polluted with people constantly. 
---
What step were you on when you quit?
---
My teammate kind of bugged it last night.  I was on the Storeroom, and opened the door to get the second half of the recipe.  He had just entered the area for the first time but ran in behind me and got the second half before getting the password.
---
It wouldn't let him progress properly, simultaneously telling him to get the password and collect the ingredients, but neither updating properly when he got the password from the Terminal, or gathered ingredients.
---
He logged out and back in, and it properly updated the password step for him, and set him to just needing to get the ingredients.
---
Are they time limited such as they event next week?
---
50? I want to avoid being unreasonable big
---
No, it appears brewing is a permanent addition to the game, and Biv's daily is likely permanent as well.
---
I'm on top of a mountain (stone arch)
---
I omitted that one because I don't have any explanation for that particular one. I do agree it's for sure the Mothman but why is it so different from the other...
---
We may have new clues with incoming content tho', at least I hope so :-)
---
So attach to the switch in the brick side?
---
Currently it's like through the middle of the side with the keypad
---
Oh yeah let's nerf end game content. That's what everyone's been begging for right? Or.. was it...
---
Woke up under a (radio?) Tower where there was a locked door (that I could walk around) with a couch, a TV and a bucket with a Plunger.
---
*Sigh* Bethesda gonna Bethesda. 
---
Luck my dudes and dudettes. Luck determines anything that gets dropped.
---
Thx, don't know about that location, gonna check it out asap
---
This wastelanders expansion is awesome
---
Where's you camp homie?
---
I'll go water your crops for you.. ;)
---
try switching to fullscreen not windowed if you haven't.
---
&gt; I did notice while checking inventories that I can't drop items either. I can move stuff from inventory to stash and back without a problem.
---
This is related to the inventory mods.
---
So it's possible your Fermenter issue is related too.
---
The update did a big change to the inventory system, and the inventory/sorting mods do not work properly and cause problems.
---
I mean, if you are going to have a box specifically for gifting items it should be able to hold at least one of each item...  (not all at once but one at a time, there are items in game that exceed 30 lbs in weight)
---
It‚Äôs listed under your available weapon receiver mods, just like ‚Äòautomatic‚Äô and ‚Äòvicious‚Äô receivers. With a prime receiver you need to use ultracite ammo which deals more damage to the scorched, but for all other creatures the damage is the same as Hardened receiver. So if you don‚Äôt do much SQB fights, hardened is better choice. Ultracite ammo is more work. 
---
I'm on PC and have been having a hard time hearing him as well. If it wasn't for the subtitles, I wouldn't have known what he was saying.
---
I do this already. However,  moving from area to area to get specific resources is expensive. I suggest a 'better bang for your buck' method of renting out area to do what you want with so long as you have the caps to spend. Also taking into account that most areas only house one type of resource per ploppable area. A mini workshop would provide 4 - 5 nodes of resources for players to cash in on. 
---
Me too! I‚Äôm gonna try to move it to my personal stash but I swear I‚Äôve done it this when I had all the materials on me before and it still didn‚Äôt work 
---
And yet we have ghosts and little green men from space.
---
&gt;sunset
---
&gt;night
---
What kind of black magic is this!
---
It‚Äôs not the time consumption I‚Äôm worried about. It‚Äôs the ammo consumption. I unload their entire weight in lead before they go down. 
---
Ignore all enemies that spawn &lt;50
---
Basically if you want level 50 gear don't waste your time with anything other than robots, super mutants, and scorched. Scorched for some reason have an extremely low spawn rate for 3* legendaries.
---
I have no clue why Bethesda decided to cap Wendingo, mole miners, snally gasters and such at &lt;50. It's pretty stupid that you can't get level 50 gear from a Wendingo because they cap at level 42.
---
Damn... your was a far nicer setup than mine too :(
---
Yeah, I guess it is related. I just updated them though. I'll try removing them and see what happens... Thanks!
---
I myself liked leveling an alt recently, part of the reason was that there WASN'T as many people, especially in lower level zones.  It really felt like walking into a post-apocalyptic world that was frozen in time, I found it very immersive.
---
Areas weren't pre-looted. This was a big issue I had when I played after launch, coming into new areas, and everything was looted, locked doors were opened (even those as part of a quest). It broke a lot of the immersion for me.
---
I had a legendary liberator also immediately explode on death. (PS4)
---
The trailer video showed a mole miner for the legendary vendor, so at the very least we will have one more "living" npc to keep Grahm company.
---
I don‚Äôt want what many MMOs do. It‚Äôs one of the things about this game that brought me back to playing MMOs. 
---
Those player hubs in other MMOs don‚Äôt greatly enhance the play of the game. 
---
They mostly become cluster fudges and price fixes market boards. 
---
What they need is to add tools and options that allow us better in game communication and ways and reasons to connect.
---
Considering that we‚Äôll be getting in camp vending machines I don‚Äôt think they will be going in that direction.
---
I do think they could easily put something in the pipboy that allows us to post messages to a message board. LFG posts. Looking to buy/sell adds. Missed connections. 
---
I'm not on the PC.  But there are numerous topics here about it, and some mention that on Nexus the author of the inventory mod recommends turning it off until he fixes it.  (Third hand info though, but players who disable their mods fix their issues).
---
Cthulhu would be much more bigger in my opinion and both Cthulhu and the Deep Ones matches the description of what we find in Lucky Hole mine, it can't be Ug-Qualtoth itself tho', I chose to believe this is a Deep One or the hybrid progeniture of one (because they mate with humans)
---
That's where you usually find the raider PA used by Jeff Lane ;-)
---
Dig it!
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed that sort of misty lighting in my CAMP before. The sun set directly facing the front of my building... does the sun move across the sky seasonally in the game?
---
If you can't find it let me know, I'll try and get pics of it for you! Or show you on the map.
---
It‚Äôs not a live enemy. It‚Äôs a washed up shark and it‚Äôs through the grass past the little shack that has the picnic tables around it and the half assed tent you can loot. More in back of where you pick up the bucket of coal to do the event where you have to put the coal in the miners carts. At the tip of that along the water
---
I loved it, entering the speakeasy with level 30s to level 100s walking around talking to Biv (Best NPC) crafting beers was immersive as hell
---
No luck on the consoles, either. It could be a new mission coming soon, or it could just be an unfinished vault. Whatever was going on there, there is a volleyball net nearby and looks like they were playing until the bombs dropped.
---
Holy crap! That worked, thanks.
---
So a five piece set will mitigate 75% of an attack‚Äôs damage, right? As long as I‚Äôm standing there (basically not moving the movement stick and only shooting)?
---
Is this the best way to get use out of Sentinel? Or what do people typically do to maximize?
---
I once found that the disco ball gave me the ‚Äúobject is floating‚Äù error. 
---
Oh I‚Äôll have to check what mine are. What‚Äôs your CPU/GPU?

---
I sugested this before as well, along with a large number of other things that I think would benefit the 'food' side of the game an let people trade more because it'd make some food types reliable to make for people that enjoy making such things
---
Actually toon was used long before toontown. It was used as a short term for Cartoon Character in some D&amp;D forums and such it just stuck into some RPG's 
---
at least that is my understanding of it as myself and some others have used it before toon town and they nor I have never played it 
---
I hope when the faction system gets introduced it will work a little like a clan of some kind. That means you can always team up with clan members. I find that works well if the clan is upfront and honest about their objectives in the game. It makes it really easy to connect to random players with similar goals in mind which translates into good play sessions.
---
To me there seems to be this logic from high level players that levels above 50 matter. But in reality they don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know what all this salty ness about not getting to prestige multiple times if you are over level 100 is about honestly. Granted we know very little about how the system will be implemented or what it will do. 
---
TL;dr it bothers me that there is so much anger towards a system we know nothing about, that most likely won‚Äôt affect anything but a number next to your name. 
---
I don't think this is the place to ask, if there are they should be in the trophies section, if not then there's your answer.
---
Are the vending machines in game already?
---
Dude, there were five clipboards at the Walgreens today when I went to pick up my meds and part of me freaked out
---
I simply drop the paper bag near a vendor entrance, people grab them real quickly. 
---
Really? You can find a plan to craft that shark to mount on your wall? I‚Äôve never heard nor seen such a thing
---
I‚Äôm noticing something going on too. 
---
I wonder if everyone experiencing this (as I am) also has Speed Demon. This could be the cause, as it's otherwise a pretty lossless mutation. 
---
Got four drills since the patch, including one from the three-star legendary Gutsy at the end of AWOL event. It‚Äôs really an insult now. 
---
Aye, apply power to the little connector on top of the built in switch on the brick side and it should work correctly. It can be kind of a Charlie foxtrot getting the wire there though, depending on which side you want facing out.
---
I was joking, but who knows what the future holds. It would be pretty awesome. Hopefully they get those, and all the other animal heads.
---
Yeah, thought about that after I posted. Cleaning up my install now. 
---
everytime the queen regens i am devastated because the last several runs at her are so sparsely populated by geared and high level players that it takes nearly the whole time just to get to 50% let alone get through 150% of her hp.
---
if scorchbeasts were starred I'd avoid them more not less.  flying enemies are too unpredictable sometimes the damn things just peel off like a mile away once you start making a dent in their hp. imagine the devastation you'd feel if you hit 50% regen back to full and started to get back to 50% again just to have the damn thing fly across the map to attack a radrat in a different zone lol. 
---
Atleast the ghouls run at me.  lol
---
The QoL boost is tangible with this one. No more running back and forth to sell stuff.
---
Were you playing with a team, or had been earlier?
---
Myself &amp; others were having some strange issues last night after someone from the team left to join another Server.
---
I've seen this complaint quite frequently since the update. I have a feeling it's a bug. A lot of features were tweaked having to do with CAMP objects, as well as CAMP placement and locations. I'm sure it's getting looked into as we speak and hopefully we can expect to see a hot fix or patch for this next week. Until then, we might all have to be homeless.
---
Good luck fellow ressie.
---
I don't know who downvoted you, but thanks for the info.  
---
Please learn to spell trailer.

It was the 'Save Everything' mod, which I forgot to update!

Everything works as it should now :-)
---
This passage is from update 9 released in 2002, long after fallout 1 &amp; 2 releases, I do not think it's related to the master, which is more like a "bag of organs in a can"
---
As for the FEV, like I said, we know everything about it, but you won't find any text in any Fallout lore specifying West Tek **created it**. Unlike the limit 115.
---
The eating/drinking is the single most annoying mechanic in the game.

I was getting my excavator armor in Garrahan mining, a level 136 wAs also there dummy. So I couldn‚Äôt help it

Count yourself lucky. I think I've seen a total of one scorchbeast that ever gave up on me. 
---
Thx, will do
---
? 
---
Correct, there is also unyielding sentinel and vanguard/bolstering sentinel that can add to the build depending on what you prefer. Also for pvp, sentinel + assassin can mitigate over 90% of damage since assassin adds in 8% from players

I dont know the amount but if i make food and store some of it in my stash and fast travel a bunch i end up with a stack of spoiled food when the food in the stash still has remaining condition.

Yea if you could eventually craft everything in black whatever lodge that would be f‚Äôn sick! And if we eventually get all those that also would be sweet, gorilla and rhino‚Äôs incoming lol

It is, it really is, but at the same time, there's a core demographic for this game that would riot if it was removed,  they enjoy that aspect, and it *is* kind of an important factor to the whole survival aspect... but by the same token, I want to play the game, not stop every five minutes to give baby his bottle.  :/

Do you guys have the key to the TNT Dome #3. It spawns 3 quantums inside and it also held the Nuka paint for T51.
---
I do though, My brother and 2 of my friends were banned/suspended without even getting a reason why. (Brother and 1 friend never got an email at all, and last friend just got the generic one). 
---
All of 4 of us are pissed about the situation, the lack of communication, and blanket labeling done by the community. But we truly enjoyed playing together and having wacky shenanigans in Appalachia, and would go back to it if we could. 
---
As for me I just have no interests in playing without my budz, it feels hollow and a bit disrespectful.
---
If you do the uranium fever event, everytime a legendary mole miners come, you will hear the automated voice saying "a former employee from management is detected, please evacuate him" (something like this, sorry, I don't have the game in English)  
---
\+ you find some evidence in Beckley indicating their specific mutations could be the result of contaminated cranberries they ate before the war (cf. ANNEX of my post)
---
P.s. I haven‚Äôt read it yet depending on how badly you want it. 
---
I also got the combat armor one and it sold instantly for 12k. 
---
I see someone has an ego problem
---
Windowed mode is capped I think at 30fps? Maybe 40.
---
Talk to someone who‚Äôs real
---
He spawned next to me after I drank nuka shine, so I thought it was part of the quest.
---
my luck is if i attack them sometimes they fly away if i dont attack them they follow me for miles or until i log off. 
---
YuP..... GONE
---
I would be fine if I didn‚Äôt get the drip or stomach growl every 5 minutes. I actually find myself swearing under my breath every time I here those noises. It‚Äôs just too much, too often. 
---
The charging barrels have always lowered fire rate, but they are useless in thin game. Stick to the standard barrels for much better dps.
---
I am aware of this, it's like I said, we know everything about the VEC but his very origin ;-)
---
Does anyone know if Camp Fire still work? 
---
Its just like those watchtowers you find everywhere, with people growing their plants on them on every level. I want to do the same with my CAMP and tower-like buildings but somehow Bethesda must have forgotten to copy them from FO4
---
&gt; We may have new clues with incoming content tho', at least I hope so :-)
---
With it being located in Helvetia, it isn't beyond the realm of possibility we'll be drip fed a few more clues. 
---
None intended. Words can be twisted quite easily online, thanks for the catch. 
---
Today my main 400+ hours character level 193 got deleted after the new update. But my mule alt character level 4 i got left with. Now done with Bethesda, was a loyal fan of the franchise but not anymore.
---
Worlds have been awful and laggy on Xbox since the patch. Like a giant stability step backwards. 
---
I've just noticed that on top of all that, food hardly refills the meter at all now, so with that, I'm done for a while.  I have no time to play the game if I'm constantly looking for/hunting/cooking food.
---
Would you happen to know if that's in game time or if the timer will go down on it's own without playing that character?
---
I'm getting a 404 Not Found on your 2.0 link. The 1.0 looks awesome so I can't wait to see the refresh.
---
The game has eaten a couple of my high end weapons in the past, but none recently.
---
The worst was logging on and realizing all my equipped armor was missing (3\* Combat, 4 pieces), went to my Stash to retrieve my set of 3\* Heavy Metal, and 4 of them were also missing.
---
If you submit a support ticket to Betheseda, you will get a canned response stating that they cannot replace lost items.
---
I'm glad someone else had the balls to say it and take the downvotes. Have my upvote to balance out all the jerks.
---
I literally got it today from doing the daily Shooting Range quest
---
I know it doesn't make sense!
---
Same issue here.  Wound up rebuilding it.
---
I don't have a floating razor grain problem but I do have a floating corn problem.
---
 They are literally a foot off the ground where I plant them at my base
---
Eat faster damn it!!!!! Wipe the flies off, it‚Äôs still good. *cringes*
---
Yeah it's really a pain
---
I just checked it on my phone and it came up.  Might be a website glitch.
---
That's the whole problem. You're tagged and can't get untagged no matter what. I thought they'd update their ban script or have some kind of update but so far still silence
---
Strange in numbers is still removing the positive effects when viewed in the pip boy, watoga bots sometimes explode directly on death and body can't be found to loot.
---
Yeah I want a nice looking greenhouse for my adhesive farm
---
Love it.  Only one thing:  you may want to move the dart boards if you use explosive weapons.  I placed mine on trees and/or the external side of an existing in game structure
---
This was patched, but we really shouldn't need a workaround. 
---
Floating gourds for the win
---
Because I'm dumb, where is the playing vending in the camp? I tried looking for it but couldn't find it. Do I have to find a plan for it first?
---
I noticed you have a wack of fans, is your push / pull air flow through the case screwed up?
---
Do you have a way to check temps inside the case and the cpu/gpu/board?
---
 With airflow you want your intake air amount and your exhaust air amount to be similiar, with the exhaust side being larger than the intake if you cant make it equal.
---
If you have more intake air than exhaust, you pressurise the cabinet, and cause the air flow to stagnate a bit which will create higher temps inside the case.
---
Check that you dont have fans working against each other, ie all case fans are exhausting and no intake, or fans on each side that shortcut the airs ability to flow all the way through your case.
---
In a basic case you want the air being intaked from the lower front of the case and being exhausted out the back closer to the top (warm air rises and we want to get rid of the heat.) I run 2x 120mm on the front of my case, one exhausts over the hdds at the bottom and is intaked and exhausted by the gpu card, and the top 120mm blows directly over the cpu heatsink and is picked and exhausted by a 92mm and my psu's fan.
---
On my PS4 account (lvl 78) I had to defend the ammo plant against 3 level 80 SBs... all I got was SB scraps and duplicate plans. Would love to have gotten a couple legendaries from it 
---
I have carnivore mutation, so at least I can skip the cooking thing. It chaps me to have to put 3 points into can do to search garbage cans constantly for food. I just want to explore and kill stuff 
---
I had major issues rebuilding mine last night. It wasn‚Äôt letting me place items that had no reason not to place. I constantly had to go in and out of the build menu to get things to work. I also couldn‚Äôt plant all of my crops even though there was dirt everywhere. Very frustrating and never had these issues before. So yeah, you‚Äôre not alone.
---
I'll check it out when I have some more time!
---
I am talking about just the chest piece. All the others would be the same. How does the sentinel factor in? Video game math is the hardest math. Next to toilet paper math of course. 
---
You know what would solve this problem?
---
Having a dam server text chat like a normal online game.
---
Where can you find it?
---
Thanks for the suggestion.  I'll look around the area for a good place for one later today.
---
This.  I am so done with being forced to micromanage hunger/thirst instead of actually playing the game.  
---
It's nice to know we have a way but eventually this will be patched out. We shouldn't have to do this anyways!
---
Food seems to fill me up less and i have to eat a lot more regularly than before!
---
That update is split up from this week until may, each week introduces one new thing from the trailer. But yea its in a pretty good state
---
Yeah I remember those. I like to build my own watchtowers but I get what you mean!
---
I just did a nuke and it says i have 120 hour cool-down. Server says all nukes are ready but for some reason i have a 120 hour cool-down. 
---
Be Advised. Nuking for this week is off-limits. 
---
NP, although, warning in there, I may have found a PETA supporter or Vegan as they commented about how taming/domesticating animals is a 'vile act' lol
---
Agreed, they certainly are not worth the effort, time and ammo in their current state.
---
Hey, welcome to FO76.  I too was late to the party, I picked it up at launch but ended playing more Red Dead 2.....i just went back to Fallout a few weeks ago.  Game is much more stable than it was in the beginning, and I have not really run into any griefers.  I think the game took a slight hit to stability with the most recent patch....I had two freezes in 5 hours yesterday...both while using fast travel...but others are not having that issue.  
---
If you like the fallout universe, especially FO3 and FO4, FO76 will be enjoyable.  Great community, seems each server has at least one high level player just going around and helping other players.  
---
You may not care, but those of us who write well care, and the fact that people thought the post was praise worthy is indicative of a deep need for better literacy in the world.
---
What if they collected all the caps everyone spent on fast travel and made it a special event to retrieve it or a boss to defeat to get all the caps. 
---
You need to have at least 1 Chameleon Armor Piece, select all others for their Perks, looks aren't important since most players wear an Outfit that hides the Armor Anyway.
---
I use mostly Combat Armor, and have experimented with BOS vs Shadowed mod and found no significant difference to Sneak success.
---
Be Aware that there is a bug messing with Stealth that is worsened by being on a team.
---
Hehehehe
---
I'm looking forward to that. Anyone want some muttchops? Haha
---
As someone else mentioned, it prevents positive interactions between high and low level characters. It also prevents lowbies from participating in more difficult content without fear of being overrun. High level folks are aware of low level players and often times try to watch out for them in case they get disabled. Levelled servers would make these interactions impossible.
---
I am gay.
---
The chance to gain mods plan is very low for every set of armor. 
---
To clarify the RNG behind: 
---
\-You roll a dice for every armor mods unlockable (each having the same unlock chance)
---
\-If any succeeded you get the higher roll among them
---
So when you start farming it would come somewhat easily (4-5 breakdowns) and when you have many plans unlocked it's a real pain in the ass (I broke down at least 500 to get every material for every parts+pocketed+lead lined). 
---
Note that which parts you're broking down doesn't matter, so I would advise you to break arms as they are the cheapest to craft.
---
Eventually, the linings you can unlock are shared for limbs and arms, but the materials are separated.
---
For more info on getting mods by scrapping either armor or weapons, here's my reference : [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5pbsr/every\_weapon\_mods\_learn\_chance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5pbsr/every_weapon_mods_learn_chance/)
---
A huge thanks to this guy.
---
Blackreach mines
---
I‚Äôve gotten some really good drops from violent night lvl 40 ish unfortunately. I only try to keep 3* max lvl drops due to the weight limit. Haft to get rid of sooooo much nice stuff. 
---
It seems that decay time on all types of things (food items, your hunger/thirst meters) is tied not to in game time passing, but frame rates, this may be the cause as this last patch did have some performance updates in it as well
---
This is what I do as well, although I have two accounts and my PC can handle running two games simultaneously, so I just drop stuff on the ground with one account and pick it up on second. Still working on my full unyielding + wt reduction set.
---
Really? I thought it was the real Harley quinn... Phew, I'm so glad you set me straight. Us dumb girls not knowing the difference between fictional and real people.
---
Brewing potions and poisons in Skyrim was my absolute favorite pastime, I was constantly on the lookout for new ingredients and tinkering with my recipes to make the deadliest substances I could brew. I don't think I'd ever stop playing Fallout if it had a similar system.
---
I do but I‚Äôve had them for weeks without issue. Good suggestion thought I might see if moving them affects anything.
---
Yup it happened to me just now ugh :/
---
It is widely speculated that the wastelanders DLC to be released this fall will include NPCs. New storylines are being released every few weeks for the next several months. There is still only voice chat. I suggest you watch the trailer and read the roadmap listed. I hope you come back! The game is still pretty fun I think.
---
Since the above guy didn't answer you, but I do the exact same thing: yes, I work full time 9-5 as the head of IT for a medium sized public library. I also run a successful youtube channel that earns me a reasonable side income. 
---
Nuka Quartz is amazing too, even if it is just vanilla cream soda.
---
Make sure your flooring is all the right way around. This will at least help with your exterior walls. 
---
Partitioning rooms etc. will require some messing around. I recommend placing another floor piece on the other side as others have suggested, this usually allows me to flip it.
---
...but yes I would totally love not having to do this, have some karma!
---
Someone would get 25000 caps because of the currency cap. It would be less depending on how many caps you have. Nice thought though. 
---
Yes, last night I loaded it up with 10 drinks to ferment and logged and went to sleep. I logged this morning to a friend's server to find my CAMP could not be placed but stayed anyway because I was going to craft a PA set for him. Crafting pulled materials from my stash. I loaded my stash back up with gunpowder and junk The fermenter (not placed) probably aged some of those 10 things in the time I was on the server without my CAMP. I quit and tried to join a new server. DC immediately on connect. Happens every time on that character. My other characters work fine.
---
I wish I knew that before I flew through my quest levels in my first 30 levels. Oh well that‚Äôs what a second character is for
---
I had a level 40 bloodied/explosive/15% vats Western Revolver drop at Whitespring. By far the best drop I've ever gotten......I feel like I beat level 40.
---
Maybe they're less worried about people spelling out Œ®Œ©ŒõŒó all over their camps
---
I was getting an issue where I‚Äôd try place something and it‚Äôd come up with an error along the lines of ‚Äúnothing to be placed‚Äù. Had to quit build mode to fix it. 
---
I would say it‚Äôs nice for the first hour or so and going into flat woods but the game feels like you should start seeing other vault dwellers around the time you start to take on the Farm Supervisors and start doing other events.
---
I agree with the quest immersion, I feel like some of those main quests should have an interior area that‚Äôs instanced. It was such a pain trying to kill the guy for the overseer quest. 
---
This was fixed in the last patch 
---
I love how people downvote you. "THAT ONE IS DIFFERENT!! GET THE PITCHFORKS!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!". 
---
My husband was at the lumberyard yesterday bought a bag of screws(to finish the Exactor power armor), lol
---
Yeah odd. Pulled up on my phone okay so it‚Äôs probably my office network filter. 
---
Very nice work. I like the idea of a public and private area. 
---
Some areas seem to blocked out due to Creature, or legendary spawn areas, I hade the same issue in the Cranberry Bog, after weeks of scouting the perfect location, I couldn't build anywhere near the location I wanted.
---
But it seems Bethesda thinks it's OK to build a Floating Turret Base right outside the Back door of the WS Golf Club, Go figure.
---
Legendary items is going too far.  They actually spawn quite frequently, and they probably don't want people farming them.
---
Other tougher enemies drop some useful materials, like acid, screws, or springs.  I think if they dropped 4 different materials like that besides their meat and hide, they'd feel like worthwhile enemies to fight.   Considering what's in Scorchbeast Guano, I figure them holding 4 different materials like screws, and ballistic fiber is a believable prospect.  Perhaps even flux?
---
I've made about 50K .50 Cal Ultracite Ammo in the last 2 weeks (honestly pretty easy to make). Kind of afraid to make more.
---
Hmm where abouts? I always go to tanagra to fight the group that spawns over t the right by the run down shacks, is it near there?
---
I noticed mine was slow again, I popped a rad x to compare it and it sped back up, weird. My mutations weren‚Äôt suppressed at all...now it seems when the rad x wore off they slowed down again
---
Seems very possible. Good analysis. So, maybe OP can update his TL DR warning, move it to the top, make it big bold and red, and tell people that if they have a fermenter in use and join a server where their CAMP cannot be placed, leave immediately before something ages in your unplaced fermenter and screws up that character's ability to join any server afterwards.
---
Tbh the stash thing was mainly because they had all the crafting stations but players were unable to use stash materials like at every train station, so it became more of a quality of life improvement rather than a lore thing
---
Thank you. My plan eventually is to open up everything but the personal water supply once pacifist mode applies to camps.  I only have the arch locked up to keep people from damaging it.  That thing is expensive to repair.  I always open the door when I'm there so it can be used.
---
Mutations are op. Especially chameleon for pvp. You can buy them for 200-400 a pop by posting here. Bloodied is really good for pvp if you use rads to keep your health low. Especially in nuke zones. All plans are available at a specific vendor now, which vendor they are at depends on the plan. Workshops are pvp zones and people actively server hop to look for workshops so they can take them to pvp, even if they are a much higher level so be careful. Oh and finishing the BOS questline gets you a free set of lvl 50 ultracite armor. Thats all i can think of at the moment. 
---
Lmao slowpoke.jpg
---
Yeah, it usually takes me about a minute to quit. When the game first came out, however, I couldn't quit the game at all, it would simply hard crash. So I'll take the longer wait time.
---
This may be a huge pain in the ass, but you may also want to test with / without the Speed Demon mutation.
---
that's curious! Was it a diluted or full strength one?
---
You know you would make more caps just selling the individual ingredients right?
---
Done
---
What system?
---
I would suggest you re-explore the map. Work on your build. Maybe start a new character. You will probably have more fun starting over. It wont take long to get to the mid thirties and you will be back in the swing of the game mechanics
---
Maybe a compromise could be part of the prestige system where you would have a max of 1 to 50 for each prestige.  That would allow high level people choose to be in an area to help lower level people but the people that want to prestige to do higher level content can still move ahead.  
---
Any prestige perk bonuses would not skew the pve or pvp aspect of it too. As the people in servers would have similar bonuses. 
---
You see, this is what I am talking about. That trailer was misleading/clickbait to players who haven't following the news. And that trailer wasn't some E3 trailer to hype with some cool cinematics 2 years before game is being release. It was trailer to show what is in expansion. It should been also include label saying that "This is what is going to roll out over the next 3 months" etc. What makes it even worse, they labeled it under "Available Now".
---
Not sure what changed, but I sure take a lot less radiation damage from collecting water as well.  I think the meter has always said '1', but I collected almost 100 last night with nearly no radiation damage... whereas before I'd have to pop some radiation drugs.
---
You should go take the food processing plant for a day and stock up on Salisbury steaks, herbivores can eat them too (somehow lol)
---
Changed my world, now if I ever run out of food, there's my never spoiling Salisbury steak and purified water to get me through.
---
I will however admit I noticed I was becoming thirsty super fast so swapped out ghoulish for dromedary, it helped a lot, even nukacola restores like 18% thirst now.
---
Its amazing. I can only get kn to game for an hour or two a day.  These guys must have so much time on their hands its crazy to me
---
Thank you, omw
---
I can confirm those issues on XB1 with turrets, the mothman statue, and many other things.  Leaving the build mode and re-entering allowed placement.
---
I have a feeling it's something to do with new Julia cola lights coming out sometime soon and their effects ts being attributed to certain other camp lights by accident. 
---
I don't believe it's a vault. I do think it's a bunker with a dark past though. All vaults were built with a similar design. The bunker doesn't look like the vault on the inside.
---
Can you invite
---
The faster fire rate can be offset by having, as stated in the main post, a greatly increased recoil and spray as you fire, making it more inaccurate as you pull the trigger. That's why I stated it would be a close range, emergency option in case of being swarmed by numerous critters.
---
I'm curious as to what your revolver does though, can you list them out here and show me what perks you're using? 
---
Yeah but that would sack. You'd never have your home base. I think a mobile shop solves a lot of problems
---
Protectively asserting dominance.
---
Interesting, I‚Äôll buy that for a dollar.  Still feel kind of bad bashing in the heads of the mentally challenged though.
---
I'm just wo seeing on average how much you play I can only get kn for an hour or two at a time 3 or 4 times a week. :(
---
Xbox has been miserable since the patch on my machine. Laggy, slow loads, etc
---
Nah. High levels can smoke scorchbeasts. Given how frequent scorchbeasts come out in the Bog, it'd just become the new Whitesprings.
---
My HW/PA Bloodied build literally chunks level 80's in about 6 hits. My stealth sniper bloodied takes about 3 (headshots and crits)
---
I did it last night with a friend... he picked up the items first, and they were there by the time I was finished checking out the new building.  I know the door closes really fast and relocks for the password room.  In fact, I was thinking that it would be a problem but it seemed to respawn so fast for us that it wasnt.
---
What's your gt
---
How you doing it? I got the same gun
---
I agree with everybody else to get somebody to kill you, but there are still a lot of people out there reluctant to PvP even when there is a bounty. I walked around for a bit and people were ignoring me so eventually I jumped on my mic and asked somebody to take me out and they obliged.
---
I got my bounty because I didn't realize taking items from somebody else's supply drop creates a bounty. I thought the items populated for everybody on the map just like the supply drop for the Morgantown airport event.
---
Zartu
---
It won‚Äôt. Kind of a mute point. I doubt any release going forward will be strictly single player.
---
I have the same thing going on right now but I have to drink Bourbon
---
Same. I'm thinking damn, just what I need to fix my PA to be immune to headshots... and any shots
---
Not that bad 
---
Hey, we get it. You're upset.
---
These perk cards and mutations are working as intended. Using them in a manner you don't feel is appropriate is not exploitation, it's entitlement.
---
Consider adding reactive plates to your PA, consider gamma guns, consider staggering him or crippling a leg to disable sentinel, consider executioner's weapons, consider using a bloody build yourself, consider running away and living to fight another day (with more caps.) If you refuse to use the tools offered to you, and insist only that every single perk loadout be completely level, then you're setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Good luck.
---
&gt; Could they not use the same coding that lets foundations be 'sunk' into the ground a bit? 
---
Yes, literally. 
---
We are looking into addressing this issue with an upcoming hotfix. As soon as we have all the timing we will update this thread.
---
All valid advice, except I would prefer they just fix it.  Or not fuck with it in the first place. Leave that crap for the survival mode, maybe?
---
Has the one at the Mount Blair trianyard always been there? I just found it last night on one of the small buildings. Won't let me put in a code though.
---
I'd rather a nonspiteful legit lolz quest where you experience the wackier side of the wasteland.  I'm talking party hat wearing deathclaws, a lvl 3 ghoul and lvl 1 scorched romance, a random eyebot popping out of a scorchbeast guano pile playing the BoS anthem, petrified corpsea having notes on them being like 'I lost my Jangles, I can't go on, JAAANGLLEESSS NOOOOO!!' 'Quantum Teddy Bear, demands I take him to Pylon V13, said his home is there, I must complete his desires, I must, return him to the past to undo this evil that is nuclear bombs!' 'I JUST NEEDED THE GUM, GUMDROPS, WATERMELON GUM, GRAPE GUM, COLA GUM, GUM, OH THE GUM, I NEED YOU, WHERE ARE YOOUU?!!'
---
And maybe even a super mutant birthday party 'ME STRONGEST MUTANT', 'ME BIRTHDAY, ME STRONGEST!' 'NO ME!' 'NO MEE!' 'MEH, HAVE MEAT, BIRTHDAY MUTANT, MAKE WISH WHEN BITE!' 'I WISH YOU BE STRONGEST MUTANT' 'Daww, you shouldn't have &lt;3'
---
I would LOVE stupid silly zanny whacky stuff like this.
---
World full I am in queue 
---
I've been maximizing my efficiency in games for a long time. It comes from playing lots of MMOs and games like Diablo 2 and 3, Path of Exile, etc. I treat FO76 the same. I typically play for 2-4 hours in the evening after work, and on weekends it's not uncommon for me to get up, make coffee, play for 7-8 hours, get food, then play until I pass out. I'm single and don't have / want kids, so there's that.
---
I'm pretty sure we won't be seeing any multiplayer in the next Fallout &amp; TES.
---
Ah okay
---
Yeah they probably won‚Äôt resolve it
---
Way it usually goes for me on xbox, world loads but I can't move, can move but not jump, my objective list/ missions show up, all good. Open up pip boy at any point and game feels like it hangs for an extended time. Been like this since patch 5 for me.
---
They arent mentally challenged. They are mutated baby people without the advantages of a society. Raising themselves as a first generation with caveman type intellect.
---
They could arguably be as smart as humans just no foundation to their society
---
Almost directly to the right on the map. It‚Äôs an old sheetmetal warehouse looking thing.
---
Disappointment
---
Concrete and steel
---
Concrete will be the main ingredient. 
---
Ehhhhh....
---
There's such a huge variance in performance based on your gear and build, this is a hard one to call.
---
My damage focused PA/HW Bloodied build with just a 1star bloodied gatling gun downs Any scorchbeast in 10-20 5mm rounds, which are cheap. I take almost no health damage, I have healing factor so as soon as he's dead I regen automatically, and I haven't had to repair my power armor in a month or longer. 
---
While I agree the rewards arent worth it, guaranteed legendaries from them would just end up with players like me farming the Bog endlessly
---
Similar opinions. Dupers did help a lot of players to get where they are now. Instead of farming months, many players can play the play style they wished to play with instead of having no fun due to lack of ammo, etc reasons. 
---
Most of the players didn‚Äôt realized that though. If you have a god roll or semi god roll gun or melee weapons or armor pieces, 90% of chances they are duped items. 
---
If you walk underwater you can see fishies swimming and part of the Nuka-Cola plant that got knocked off. Pretty interesting stuff under there once you can swim without Rads/diseases....
---
Mine takes about 30 seconds to fully load in. I have great internet, so I figured it was my xbox - original almost 6 years old.
---
Cranberry baby food!
---
There is a plan out in the world I think, but you can buy it from the Harper's ferry vendor
---
I completed my daily from big and got lead champagne Bellini recipe. It takes carrot flower nectar and vintage lead champagne to make it. Now I just need a recipe for lead champagne and Bellini's all round
---
I'm going to disagree.
---
Not saying that there shouldn't be ANY legendary SB's but imagine the CAMP set ups by the fissure sites with missile turrets all set up to make quick work of the Sierra Bravos. It'll be a an automated legendary items farm. I killed 10 in 45 minutes at that BOS outpost in cranberry bog with that missile turret set up there and got my Enclave General rank 
---
Do you need someone to ay with? What system are you on.
---
The game is fun solo but better with other players. I rarely join teams with players I don‚Äôt know but I will follow them around and interact with them. 
---
Take workshops and your player interactions will increase 80% good and 20% negative. 
---
Ah ok, thanks will check it out, I must have missed the keypad or something, cheers!
---
I hope it works. I had this issue start a few weeks ago, and it wasn't every wall with things stuck to it, either. I make modular 1x1 that I can snap together to have a nice CAMP, and I could place one but not the other two. I also had some items stacked on top of shelves/rugs, but this was theoretically patched. Good luck!
---
r/sarcasm
---
Yeah, I wasn't quite sure if it was 30 or 40 fps.
---
Can confirm. Same issue.
---
Thank you. I'm apparently receiving down votes because it's game informer's fault, not Bethesda. When truthfully, the fault lies with both. 
---
I have had them drop 2 or 3 times from patrol duty quest. I can't make any promises but I will check and see if I still have one when I get on. 
---
Def happened to me on xbox at watoga station 
---
I'm on PC. What are workshops?
---
Still full
---
I am pretty sure they will be coop optimized.
---
If the eating/drinking added anything other than a pointless grind, it wouldn‚Äôt bother me. It‚Äôs just a worthless waste on time. For many with limited play time because of this thing called life, the mechanic detracts from the game. 
---
Yeah one thing I forgot to mention I did in fact switch and lowered my resolution all the way 
---
Weapons still being deselected/unequipped on FT, or enter/exit PA. also sometimes randomly unequipped while playing. On Xbox one. 
---
Great Work! 
---
The great thing is it can be played both ways. I‚Äôm playing it as a lone wanderer and it‚Äôs a lot of fun. There are less proper npc‚Äôs than typical fallout games so it can sometimes be lonely. But it fits with the story so it‚Äôs not so bad. As for the story, you learn about it by exploring and reading terminals. For me that is one of the best things the game has to offer and it‚Äôs best done alone. But I do say hi to my fellow vault dwellers when I see them. 
---
I play solo most of the time and it's great. You can bump into people a lot depending on where you are and what events are happening, but their mostly chill.
---
You got some inside info you'd like to share with us
---
Yes! I would love to have fertilizer plots back!
---
Lucky hole mine + Hornwright Test site for lead / steel ore. Toxic Larry's for acid (server hop for ~20 acid per hop from the 3 snallygasters). Ultracite I've had stockpiled for a while, but you get a reasonable amount from queen fight (20 IIRC) and you can always clear out Glassed Caverns for more if needed. For making violet flux, I just do queen fights and thoroughly clear the area afterwards with Green Thumb on. A good run, assuming the nuke is in the right spot, will yield 170+ Raw Violet Flux, which with Super Duper can easily = 22 stable violet flux, so that's 22 x 180 = 3,960 (x1.3 for super duper) = 5,148 ammo made.
---
I usually buy my gunpowder since new players typically have lots that they won't use. I also clear West-Tek out for steel and legendary farming.
---
Deadliest I found was a mix of Jarin Root and ninroot (sp)
---
I'm getting the overencumbered icon and being prevented from fast-travelling despite having an inventory weight below my carry weight. One step forward and two steps back...
---
Yes, the cake is a lie.
---
lowering resolution can actually impede fps. Set it to the native resolution and try again.
---
Good point, maybe have it be a daily quest? Or an event like a mini queen fight that spawns at fissures, just instead of a queen it‚Äôs a legendary scorchbeast. Makes it so there isn‚Äôt constant scorchbeast farming and there can be legendary scorchbeasts if implemented 
---
Hemlock holes is really good for violet flux! More than 250 raw violet! Thanks for the info dude
---
Sorry but I skipped your suggestions on fans lol. I have a liquid cooling system and I OCed my gpu and it‚Äôs still running under average. All aren‚Äôt pulling, and all temps on my pc are good, I‚Äôll check out your links my friend.
---
Yes the camp load ins are awful since the patch
---
I think it's broken... I hope I will have more luck tomorrow \^\^
---
No, seeing I already had 1980 1020 as default and encountered this issue that‚Äôs not the problem my friend.
---
Calm down, Dala.
---
I've been having a blast, personally.
---
Agreed.. I'd love to come back to my camp and be able to go on the roof for my food..
---
Instead of coming back to destroyed crops..
---
I have enjoyed it by myself. You do encounter others,  how often depends on where you are. You can go hours not encountering anyone. Most that you do encounter are respectful of people wanting to play alone. However, they're some people that want to provoke player vs player. But most are cool and respectful and will help ya out if you're in trouble
---
Fuk dude, you gotta start writin all this down. Nice!
---
It really bugs me the Stash Boxes are not Enclave stash boxes. Then I was told WS Bunker is a Vault and I protested the idea. I'm on the fence because MODUS is something Vault-Tec would make. TBH I kind of like the idea now. That Vault-Tec is responsible for the Enclave. 
---
I'm also wondering if he isn't Vault-Tec who made him and why?
---
Oh! Lever action rifle! I thought I read Hand Made.
---
I can make both up at your needed level with whatever receiver ( except prime ) barrel &amp; stock configuration you desire. Just give me screws and 2 minutes. My game tag, georgepluck
---
Hmmm I may have to do this. Didn't realize there were so many ferns up there. Good tip man.
---
Honestly I personally never downvoted anything to do with this thread. 
---
I forget to mention that both of the wall pieces are a mirrored texture.
---
As a different guy responded earlier i think the closest thing is a star spawn but yes much too tiny for Cthulhu.
---
There is so much up there dude! Also you don‚Äôt have to worry about the queen making a ton of noise haha 
---
Lol 50. You need about 800-1k to do a queen fight, if you're conservative. If there's other people handling DPS though, especially melee users, then it's super worth it imo.
---
Mine just sent me to Flatwoods
---
wat? It has always been 5 rads each time you collect water....
---
I'm lvl 65 and have played solo the entire time.  The only exception to that is when I bump into other players and we clear an area together, but in that case I haven't teamed up or use voice chat with them.
---
I love the game and it's managed to keep my attention since it's release.  I do have a lot of the same issues with the game as others such as stability, but overall the experience has been good.  
---
The drills are legendary. We‚Äôre talking about them, aren‚Äôt we?
---
Y'all eat non-spoiled food? Pffft amateurs 
---
They streaming today?
---
Yes I crafted over 100k 5.56 and I got temp banned for it a month ago
---
I saw some wind chimes at my parent's house yesterday...oh hey, aluminum scraps.
---
I had been earlier. Then he left so i thought it would be just me. But a few minutes later, it said leaving world without my consent
---
Noted! I'll add this to our feedback.
---
They should have left the stacking and just made the foundations breakable. 
---
Tequila sunrise is bugged, a friend of mine got the recipe, doesn't show up, and you need 1 tequila sunrise to make 3 of them ? wtf
---
That sure is one heck of a combination but iirc Jarrin root was mostly limited to a single instance intended for that one Dark Brotherhood quest, meaning it wasn't really a viable source of poison in the long-term. Great for taking one thing down, sure, but I tended to prefer stuff that was admittedly less powerful but also renewable.
---
April 9 :)
---
April 9
---
They tweeted they were streaming on Twitch today
---
There‚Äôs the stupid predictable comment I was waiting for. I bet you say that to every post with ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù in it
---
Lvl 278 solo. I like it solo
---
If he only knew with certain foods and adrenaline etc im power attacking for 5-6k.
---
Yeah having a centralized hub withe everyones vending machines for even new players to reach and a zone where no one can hurt each other will be great. Maybe near the overseer camp or something? Or morgantown airport. Not sure. Free faster travel too. People should cluster around like that. Would be more lively
---
Yeah I was the same my first play through 
---
Play the main story quest. 
---
When they announced 76 I recall them specifically saying they were not done with single player games. I think you are just assuming.
---
I have had all plantable food since beta razorgrain soup was the standard food for me. As well as several of my friends. 
---
I work in a shop where we use aluminum and copper strip by the ton. Sometimes I just touch it longingly and look for loose screws. 
---
Yes, it's been happening on PC. Monsters don't seem to have a problem attacking it when it hasn't loaded in though.
---
On stream today it spawned us on the top of a Red Rocket that had the word "HELP" on the roof haha! Some fun tidbit information from the Dev's that designed the Nukashine on that stream too. [Here's the VOD!](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/395430233)
---
I played solo 95% of the time (lvl 68) and it is really enjoyable. 
---
Small interaction with other player is also good. 
---
Grief only one. 
---
#Temba! His arms Wide!
---
I have a level 5 TSE 10mm that is the love of my alt's lives.
---
I got it in one of these events :) And now I always do them. My alt's levelling armor is EPIC at this point :P
---
Is a hot dog a sandwich? 
---
You sir or madam are drunk, not tipsy.
---
I'm honestly waiting for a rorikroll meme video to come from the Nukashine! 
---
Dude was trying so hard to kill me using chamelian and gamma guns and kept coming back for more. Yet defending myself was harassment
---
I'll mention this in my feedback :)
---
Try the fullscreen mode, seen a few posts on it today.
---
Is the push pull set up properly on your rad? Is your rad clean? Pre mix fluid or DIY? (viscosity q?)
---
Have you verfied flow on your loop? Any air in the loop or piping?
---
Do you have any case fans? Or is just the gpu/psu and rad fans? There are components on the board too that get hot like the north/south bridges and the vram. Usually you cant go full passive liquid cooling unless the board / case are set up for it.
---
"Still alive" 
---
One minor content implementation after 4 months of bugs, errors, server issues and exploiters? They only break stuff when they patch once a month and even then they stealthnerfed so many things. I played active till last week, did 3-5 nukes at least every day with my clan and always saw the same randoms around. Always see the same persons who are claimed workshops and always the same names at white spring. 
---
The game still feels like an bad early access, no story or mainquestline except you count the fetchquests which 90% of all quests in fallout 76 are. 
---
Now they add one crafting item with two workbenches and a cheap 5min quest what take one developer 2-3h to code and another a few hours to model stuff as new content and everyone is hyped out and is happy the game turned so well...
---
Sangu√≠nea quest, skyrim's brotherhood... Good times
---
Dont feel bad. Todd wanted it this way!
---
Sometimes i wreck camps just so i can rack up a 500 cap bounty. 
---
So high level bounty hunters will hunt me. 
---
Poor guys with his camp wrecked.. Just so you and I could PvP. 
---
Thanks Todd!
---
I don‚Äôt think they should be *legendary* because then their health would have a chance to refill, and they‚Äôre already a large enough time sink. Their loot table does need changing though. 
---
Is nukeshine provided or shall I grab some from my stash? Pretty sure it‚Äôs still fermenting üòÇ
---
What a great time! I'm so stoked I got to watch it live! Let me know when you do it again :D
---
Well in the wasteland defenses are a must! 
---
Its old.  Been there since the day the beta started.
---
Oh. Then to answer your question, you can watch the replay on twitch itself. They save them according to ladydevann the last stream
---
Can't fully confirm, but that is a random spawn spot. I reloaded 14 times. 4 deathclaws, 3 radstag/wolfpack/rat deathmatches, 2 scortched and tent, 1 dead body with note and holotape, 4 nothing. 
---
Presumably on their Past Streams on Twitch.  The last one was archived, at least.
---
I have played solo I am lvl 156 "I'd say 25 levels were with friends" the game is 100% way more fun with people but that doesn't mean it's bad alone. It's what it is.. lonely but if you ever decide you don't want to play alone anymore then nothing's stopping you. 
---
Although I got 25 levels in a team, I have messed around a lot with friends but those friends aren't even irl people (real friends don't like the game) they are people I met in the game and had a blast with. I don't know how friendly people are now since it's been out a few months but when it first came out, anyone with a mic I spoke to was willing to roam around together doing quests.
---
This would be fantastic, the uneven terrain wreaks havoc on my ocd to the point i dont even plant crops.
---
I just created a mod to change the doors to an empty mesh.
---
Doo doo. Never gonna give you up. Never gonna say goodbye. Classic Rick Astley
---
Daily, after i am finished repairing and crafting i bulk up whatever scraps leftover and sell. Bulk is light to carry.
---
Hmm thats odd mine seems to be working better than before but ive been doing the dehydration thing too. If im low health and dehydrated my dmg goes way up. 
---

I don‚Äôt mind the lower lvl drops . I would like to join a event for x amount of caps and then be invested in that event and not haft to pay up to 4 times to get the rewards whatever it may be. Let me pay once travel to the locations and then fast travel me back to the starting point I don‚Äôt care. 
---
Like I said, yes. My fans are fine. It‚Äôs not the cooling with the system I monitor everything when I play 76 and it was all fine, I played other games and they are fine aswell. It‚Äôs just an FPS type error/glitch nothing to do with my cooling my friend. Everything is clean and new, all fans aren‚Äôt pulling, I have a couple case fans, cpu and gpu temps are good to go, all other components are being cool via multiple case fans. I put research and thought into this build so cooling isn‚Äôt the issue. 
---
Please add this, even if it's atom shop only I would buy the heck out of that.
---
Where are you located? I can't fast travel, and wanted to know if I was close enough
---
My cousin got a blueprint for the cryolator, but I want the crystallizing barrel for it, where would I find the blueprint?
---
They need better money sink. 
---
First they should get better content that actually makes sense and favors rather good teamwork than luck, because current way of getting gear is garbage RNG. 100 000+ item possibilities from single drop is garbage. The SBQ is garbage. And to all that, there are high chances for crashes and freezes. This whole endgame is garbage.
---
Once they fix the content, add special ammo (like ultracite) to vendors for caps and balance them into reasonable price with reasonable quantity. This mean, people who are in endgame can spend money to skip crafting the ammo. This creates situation where money never loses its value, because even if there are no items you to buy with money, you can always use it buy ammo, that you are going to get destroy in progress. As you run out money by shooting bullets and you need more of it. To get more money you are now willing to sell items for money rather than for gear. 
---
Also I tried the full screen fix, even worked my resolutions down to minimum and nothing, trying something from my previous post atm.
---
For real? I wonder why the times are so varied.
---
I have a full set of 2* unyielding the only thing I‚Äôm missing on the meta build on one of my characters is a bloodied melee
---
Yeah, the "investigate 4 places" is a bit irritating. For those ones, I do feel the boss should be guaranteed max level (or level scaled for the under 50s).
---
A minor issue I found: 
---
* Have some ammo loaded into the magazine of a gun
---
* Relog
---
* Click or hit "R" to bring up the weapon
---
* Observe that all the ammo that was in the magazine has been returned to inventory, and the magazine ammo count is 0
---
I can repro this at will with "Perfect Storm," a 1 star Legendary 10mm SMG. I think it was a quest reward. Didn't try it with any other weapons. 
---
Are guaranteed drops the next big QoL fix? Sure getting a lot of traction in this sub.
---
Id play it but go back after. One of the reasons I like games like F76 is that there really is no end.
---
How do I make concrete again?
---
This happened to me too.   What solved it for me was this...I purchased a drink from the bartender in Whitespring (in my case the quest called for rum), took it outside and drank it. Waited for the quest to tell me to perform a sneak attack then proceeded to range attack a ghoul with a sneak attack. That didn't work so I meleed a second one. That didn't work either so I ranged a third ghoul that was in the process of standing up and finally it registered. The quest then proceeded to say "Return the results to Biv".  Long story short it works, just not every time for some reason.  All three of the ghouls I killed clearly popped up the sneak attack damage message but for some reason it only registered success on the quest after the third kill.  
---
I'M JUST SO FUCKING HUNGRY.
---
A deep one has the head of a fish, i guess you could argue that a cephalopod is a type of fish but that's never how i imagined it or seen it portrayed.
---
Not really, as you said there is no choice other then block and leave server when someone decodes to be an a-hole.  
---
Yeah that‚Äôs wrong. 
---
Thank you. I hardly ever go on to Twitch so that‚Äôs good to know
---
You have to hit it
---
If it blended the better aspects of 76 (scrapping weapons, better crafting, layering armour under outfits, mutations, perk card system etc) and merged it with the better aspects of previous games (memorable locations, quests, characters, ability to role play and affect the world in a tangible way), fuck yeah I‚Äôd dump 76. I pretty much only play it on those rare times my friends hop on these days, and even then I don‚Äôt really enjoy the game so much as thinking of dumb shit to do with mates. 
---
Yeah I like that too. What do you think about Fallout 4s end game? Is 76 better to you or 4?
---
As far as I know it doesn't.
---
Only mirelurks do that.
---
So you can safely removes the drinks if your camp is put back down after another server hop right? 
---
Except your not stealing from anyone, it's your instanced loot behind the lock.  Not like we're talking claimed extractors.
---
I think I read in one of the terminals somewhere in the bunker that they paid vault tec to design and build the bunker so the enclave owned it not vault tec.
---
Quite possibly I read this online too so take it with a grain of salt until someone can confirm this or I can find the proof.
---
I would set aside 76 for the single player iteration. 
---
Like immediately. 
---
Good to know. But it‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs literally internet points, anyway, no one died. I just thought your comment was a bit uncalled for. If you don‚Äôt like Harley Quinn that‚Äôs cool, the same as it‚Äôs cool if I do like her. 
---
Did that quest right after servers came back up post-update, it totally reminded me of running through Flatwoods for the first time in the very early hours of our first beta with people scurrying around to solve the quest. We need more of that.
---
I thought It used to be 5 per collection 
---
Well there's holes in the ground now.  Invisible holes that you fall though the world and die, so.  There's that.  Other than that, no clue.
---
That's the kicker. I just saw you as the dude in the blue shirt in [this Kids in the Hall skit](https://youtu.be/trpZOYY3YGM), standing still with your fist out while the dude ran full steam into it.
---
Goatman is an adaptation of the native american legendary "skin walker", a shaman who has accepted dark powers leading him to be able to turn into any animal.  
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin-walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin-walker)  
---
Probably why the same legend can be heard all over the US.
---
65 to 80 can keep dropping rolling pins tho :)
---
Cool, sounds like you got the liquid cooling thing down pat. Sorry im bad for defaulting to the idea most people dont understand a thing when dealing with computers.
---
Hopefully running in fullscreen gets you back into Appalachia with some decent fps.
---
Lol wow I guess that's gonna be part of the dlc where you fight underground or something like that
---
It‚Äôs been five rads per water you collect, sorry if I was unclear.
---
Carp, hopefully your able to get things sorted.
---
I‚Äòm experiencing a strange issue after the patch. After I logged in I started to clip through the floor a couple of times until the fall killed me. I tried to respawn at my camp after that but there was the same issue, as if parts of the ground hitbox weren‚Äôt existing. I hope this gets fixed fast as I can‚Äôt even spawn into the world without dying.
---
Yeah no worries my friend! I tried out a suggestion which was turn it to medium preset, adjust the textures to how I like, shadow dis on low and delete my ini files before hand and it worked! I appreciate your suggestions my friend have a good one!
---
Any way to fix it?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I did, I used 12 at a time and didn‚Äôt lose my only one, it‚Äôd be pretty nice early on.
---
I killed my first 80 scorch beast this morning. Had 1 normal armor I think hide ammo and another thing I forgot. Not worth it.
---
Following :)
---
I had &gt;!made the nukashine and used the flash fermenter , so the "shine" is in my inventory.!&lt; The quest objective on screen changed to &gt;!give the nukashine to Biv.!&lt; Right then it froze. When I restarted 76, logged back in the item was still in my inventory, but the active quest was gone. &gt;!Also I can't give the shine to Biv, he just rolls there saying his usual shit...!&lt; 
---
You find it in the world and scrap it. You can find it in giant bags of cement mix (usually found at power plants and factories), garden gnomes and lead pipes. There's also a few nodes where it can be harvested in the wild.
---
Yep, needs to have "surface" snap point about a foot up the stalk so you can plant on irregular terrain.
---
OH! Nvm. I got it to work after 4 restarts or so
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b15amt/quest\_line\_concept\_the\_farmers\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b15amt/quest_line_concept_the_farmers_life/)  
---
I sort of wish we had more then just planters. Something like the brew quest with plants. 
---
&gt;The only time I saw higher level players go back to the start was when Feed the People gave items to the entire server.
---
This is a small sample size of N=1, but unless I'm in the middle of something I do every event that pops up in the Forest and Toxic Valley. Most of them only take a couple minutes, and even at level 140something the rewards are worth it. I get plans (usually duplicates that I can gift to noobs), assorted scraps and chems, and occasionally a level 5-10 legendary item that I can either keep for my alt character or give to a low level rando.
---
If there's someone else in the area I'll let them get most of the kills since they need the XP more than me, but if no one else is around I treat them like time trials. My record on Fertile Soil is 2:10 from the moment the event notice pops up. My current record for Poseidon (fully repairing everything) is just shy of 18 minutes, but I'm still working on the most efficient path through that maze and I think I can shave off at least 2-3 more minutes.
---
Most of fallout 4's end game came from mods. Never had much desire to keep playing after I beat the main storyline. Survival mode, FROST, and Horizon took me from \~600 hours played to almost 3,000 hours played. 76 feels less replayable (thought I do have several alts I'm leveling on for fun) and more about the end game grind.
---
Yes, was trying to plant some around my camp, but after 10 minutes of trying to plant it so that it wouldn't float I decided to have no razorgrain in my camp. Would be really nice if plants and some other items could be placed into the ground to a certain extent. 
---
Fuckin‚Äô shitty fuckin trailer park supervisor that hangs around with a big gutted drunk elf thinks he getting‚Äô us thrown back in jail but he can‚Äôt because he‚Äôs got no evidence.

we have beer.

Now we just need to be able to grow half the plants for it. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b15amt/quest\_line\_concept\_the\_farmers\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b15amt/quest_line_concept_the_farmers_life/)
---
It does this for other missions as well which was a disappointment for a game that is supposed to  e cooperative. So I was playing in a group of 3 people doing the early enclave bunker mission. You had to get through a laser grid either by hacking a console or running around finding clues to get through it some other way. I figured hacking would be easier but it needed a level 3 hacking and none of us had it at that level (this was earlier on in the game for us). So I sunk the perk points into the hacker skill, jumped on the console and powered down the laser. We all went  to the laser grid and i walked through fine but for the other two in my team the lasers were still active and they couldn't. Because they didn't have the points to upgrade hacker they had to go through the process of finding the alternative way to get through the lasers so I ended up following them around waiting for them to get up to the same part as i was (which also meant that I did the alternative way to get in and denoted the point of hacking in the first space).
---
*WITH* level 3 "Good With Salt", it feels like food is still spoiling faster than it used to without any level of "Good With Salt". 
---
Also, at least some cooked items are spoiling faster than their raw ingredient. I picked 3 Firecaps, and made 1 Firecap Soup from them, and the soup rotted first. ???
---
If the single player had mods, absolutely I'd play it. This is a huge map with so much potential to mod. I'd probably come back to the base game though from time to time.
---
Do a search, it came out during the patch ;)
---
Just means there is future content that is going to take up the space where your camp was.
---
50 should be 1, 65 should be 2, and 80 should be 3
---
It's not quite as strong I found. It's a pretty faint nuka cola on the wall. The spinning one seemed way stronger but it xpuod have been the lighting. I hope they never fix that. It made my bar/lounge so much more inviting. 
---
Had the same issue on my low level alt. Joined a new world and got in.
---
Nope, that didn't fix it. Its a bug not only limited to mods
---
You're going to be put on DOUBLE Secret Probation!
---
I did a search. Maybe I didn‚Äôt got the key word correctly. Sorry if it‚Äôs already out. 
---
That would actually be amazing, with robot corpses everywhere
---
Hahaha. It was like fighting an angry 2 year old who just keeps getting more and more mad and fails harder with each failed attempt. I was even stealth killing them with my xo1 armor while the headlamp was on.
---
Did your wife divorce you? 
---
Do you suppose this could be related to TNT dome #7 no longer saying "inaccessible" and now saying "requires key"?  Seems far away for a back entrance, but certainly adds to the intrigue...
---
I understand that‚Äôs what the message is for. I‚Äôm kind of wondering why I didn‚Äôt get it on my first login with my camp there. Or my second, or my third. To hit me many logins after seems like something is up.

The bunker/vault was built by Vault-tec under contract from the department of agriculture (I think). Vault-Tec is part of the grander "Enclave" which is made up of Government and Corporate big wigs. The Enclave are essentially the illuminati, as they have their fingers in multiple corporations and governments across the globe. One fine example is Poseidon Energy, they were contracted to create advanced weaponry. Look at the "E" next time you are at the plant, hidedn in plain sight.

Curious /u/BSloth  did you end up getting Fallout 76? And if so how does your system handle it?  
---
My specs are:  
---
Intel Core i5-3470 @3.2GHz  
---
16GB DDR3 RAM  
---
Nvidia GeForce 1050ti 4GB  
---
Been thinking about getting the game but would like to know I can run it ok before I do so
---
You'll get there on your own if you follow the main quest line somewhat as follows:
---
Overseers quest -&gt; Firebreathers -&gt; Rose -&gt; BoS -&gt; Enclave
---
You can always jump around and do things out of order, but that's the intended order.
---
You have my username, just add as a friend, I would be glad to join you on some quests. ReddPyramid and I got together last night and ran a couple of quests and farming.  It was a different dynamic playing with someone else when you are used to doing solo.
---
Has it been 20+ hours since you finished the last quest with him?
---
The problem with that is always the time constraints and thats why companions are better.
---
I only have a few hours every odd day, i would need a few dozen people willing to play to always find someone that would also be able to play at the exact time.
---
Thats just not feasible and too much hassle.
---
A NPC would solve the issue and is always available. Thats the whole point of the post.
---
Wasn't trying to be a jerk. That's why I put the winky face up :)
---
Here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1681u/patch_7_data_mine/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I wish there was one closer to the Harper's Ferry vendor. That and a crafting table that wasn't in the danger zone.
---
we had to have 4 people come in to try and launch. the 4th person could launch. this happens on different servers and silo's
---
I‚Äôm gonna build a heavy weapons armory/compound CAMP when this comes out.
---
Yes, there's a thread somewhere about it and the perk loadout mod guy on Nexus wrote a sample ini file under optional files.
---
 Okay so bare with me here. First off, I recommend reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), the OP is an absolute hero, who has worked with this engine modding and ect. since skyrim, and fallout 4 as well.
---
For a TDLR, delete your current preset files from config (under my games fallout 76 generally) with the game turned off. Then boot up the game, Select Full-screen, and the Medium graphics preset. Then from there you can change some settings like textures, however make sure shadow distance is set to low, and DO NOT TOUCH ANY FADE SLIDERS.
---
Once you've done that, if your getting solid frame-rates and want a graphical improvement, go ahead and check out [this reshade](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/234) by the same guy. I found that I actually got less stuttering in general with this, however my rig might slightly outclass yours, in which case just stick with the setting changes. If you're in game and your GPU still has around 30-40% usage left, that's when I'd recommend using this reshade.
---
Basically, the presets for High and Ultra aren't meant for 60fps gaming, they're there for cinematography and ect. The OP of that post I linked explains how the medium preset for fallout 76 actually sets values higher than ultra fallout 4, to put it in perspective. So when you're using the medium preset, then for instance upping texture quality to ultra, you're getting the same visual experience as running it on the ultra preset, except ultra runs in general 15-30 fps slower ESPECIALLY in places like harper's ferry.
---
Hope this helps man, I've dropped the same knowledge bomb like 5 times in 3 days, thinkin' this stuff needs to be in a sticky thread.  
---
Copied this post from the last time I made it. Also like people have said use fullscreen.
---
Sorry. I have no idea how this bug works yet. I haven't seen it; I've only heard it reported in several threads. 
---
Been hating this since 4, as well!
---
Thanks for the help!
---
I've seen them at Harper's i think it was, so there at least.
---
Crystalizing is mandatory, basically. It also makes it weigh less for some reason, so sweetness.
---
It is a timer based on last interaction? Not a set timer? And does the main quest line for nukashinr count? 
---
No it has not been 20 hours since I finished the nukashine quest. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs like vendor cap refreshes.
---
Hey mate just coming back to update you about this. The team is now investigating the issue. Thank you again for reporting it :)
---
Thanks for fixing this quickly!
---
That‚Äôs actually link right back to my post though. 
---
I think a better idea or an improvement to this idea is player pop ups. 
---
Basically you get a little cart or stand, which is upgradeable and has a tiny build limit with limited items so we put out a table and couple chairs , our vending machine, a sign , etc. 
---
This way we could be walki g along and see 3 or 5 people who put out their pop ups and it would look like a little farmers market. 
---
We could have signs to advertise prices and upgradeable  carts so you could see whose been trading for a long time and who just started out with their rickety wooden stand. 
---
Idea can be extrapolated to full player stores later down the road.
---
I honestly think it's such a dope idea and I've made a couple posts and comments and they get like 1 or 2 views. Its making me sad haha :(
---
And Vault 95 in Fallout 4 had the same exterior as well.
---
I woke up playing some sort of table top game with a gnome and skeletons
---
Tempted to move to the golf course for this reason and this reason alone. 
---
My character has already became addicted 9 times...
---
Yes if you are friends on your console you can play together 
---
This is exactly why people after finishing main quest come here to ask- what now? In other MMOs when you hit endgame you are rather overwhelmed of options you are given. I mean you don't know what dungeon is droping what gear, so you aren't quit sure where to start and you hit all of them one by one, just maybe get familiar with them. 
---
In F76 you don't have such thing and it is bad. You can sit in camp do nothing, RNG smiles, AWOL comes up, 3 star legendary drops you TSE or maybe less (probably simple TS), but unlike from other MMOs there is no such thing "I am going to do that and maybe in 1-3 runs I already get item i need". 
---
What makes it even worse in F76, is that you succeed in events almost all the time but most of the times you are not getting rewarded because RNG. In other MMOs you fail maybe half the times, but when you succeed you actually feel rewarded and this how it should be designed- hard by content and not hard because RNG didn't favor you.
---
Its coming, but we only recieved the first bit of content from Wild Appalachia
---
Might be for newly made food (post patch), but I lived off a stack of soup yesterday while hopping servers for several hours (that I'd made the day before) and there were no issues.
---
Going to be experimenting a bit today to see if I can find a pattern.
---
A dog companion you can dress up would be amazing
---
Thank you, does it spawn all the time or must I server hop? Also where do I get a cryolator plan of my own? And is it as good as it was in fo4?
---
That is extremely helpful, thank you! Never occurred to me to try that variant, and I just planted mutfruit at my camp, so I'm set. ;-)
---
Now if the daily challenges only wouldn't make me drink all my available booze all the time... Note to self: stash some whiskey &amp; mentats.
---
Move your C.A.M.P in the pipboy is the quickest way
---
Thanks so much, and thanks for all the hard work you and your team does!
---
Oops :-D. It's fixed now. 
---
Today me and my friend hardly killed 3 star legendary mirelurk queen  and the drop was one star shitty something.
---
It was just waste for the ammo.
---
Disregard the dumbass talking about holes in the ground. Obvious troll. What he's talking about is a bug that people who installed mods are experiencing where they fall through the world. Entirely on their end, not bethesda's fault.
---
As for new content, there's a ton of it. 
---
They released a [100 day roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
Newest addition from [the last patch](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4rzMQ3PdnK5hOjt1fc9VAV/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-march-13-2019) was [brewing and distilling](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1vtgqSxLlbipZyHOA19tT5/inside-the-vault-wild-appalachia-preview-brewing-and-distilling) which introduces a new side questline with a new location, the ability to craft and ferment alcohol with new crafting benches, new recipes etc.
---
Thanks a lot. 
---
Just using the normal pistol perks, bloody mess, concentrated fire and you could add in adrenaline to boost damage a lot. I also run adrenal reaction and have bloodied pistols I use mostly, my favourite is an auto 1\* Bloodied 10mm which is a beast! Non bloodied I only have an executioner's western revolver on my character right now, for solo play I'd probably grab my instigating for the double damage on first shot. If I was just under 50% health without adrenaline active, these are the stats:  
---
Executioner Western -189 (or instigating would be "double" at full health)
---
Bloodied Explosive 44  - 358
---
Bloodied 10mm - 101
---
Has anyone just got an infinite loading screen after drinking the nukashine and killing the party goers?
---
I started playing solo because none of my friends play the game, but  I eventually met some people that I play with on a regular basis and it's more fun that way.
---
Keep in mind that being on a team doesn't mean you can't do your own thing.  At times my team is four people going in four different directions haha. 
---
And honestly, most of the quests seem to play more like solo quests anyway.  Even if everyone on the team is running the same quest, each person must complete a specific task within the quest separately for it to count. The only exception I can think of is "I Am Become Death," the nuke launch mission.  If all team members have that quest active, then the quest will complete if one person launches it. 
---
But teaming up while equipping the inspirational perk is great for leveling.   So sometimes it's good to team up for that reason alone.
---
The latter happened to me. Was surrounded by scorched, mole miners, and a SB. I knew about the blackout before hand and had an appropriate weapon and perks loaded and had no issues, but I feel bad for low levels that this happened to.
---
I get it, I had something that was bad apparently... but now I‚Äôm suspended the same as people actually duping stuff. 
---
I also can‚Äôt be the only one who picked up stuff like this. 
---
Here‚Äôs the thing, I dump everything I can‚Äôt use or sell, no sense having that ammo if I can‚Äôt use it. Now if it was regular shotgun... yeah I would have kept it! 
---
for all we know, it could show up on the map, since they aren't live yet, we don't know, so maybe hold off on feedback about something that isn't in game just yet?
---
Just het friends lol. Bethesda literally says the game us meant to be played with friends 
---
What‚Äôs your psn name
---
Where is it listed?  I tried to find it today and I don‚Äôt see it.  Maybe I completed it with the horde of gouls the come poring out of clubhouse and missed the notification?
---
I didn't say that. I was suggesting you just walk away and not humor the attacker. A lot of people suggest block and switch servers but I don't even do that. I just pretend like the person isn't even there and continue playing. The slap damage they inflict is minimal. But some will continue to attack to trigger your mutation electrically charge or unstable isotope, doing so will activate pvp. If you don't want to pvp then don't use these mutations or take workshops. Pacifist makes it so only YOU don't initiate pvp, which is useful in areas such as the SBQ fight where there are a lot of players nearby you could accidentally damage. 
---
I woke up in the Savage Divide, there was a tightrope suspended between 2 cliffs just above Mountainside Bed and Breakfast.

Most of the time it's nothing malicious. I can easily destroy half a base in one shot from my harpoon gun, and have done so when aiming at an enemy and hitting a players base instead. 
---
Though, if I see a whitesprings turret base, it's getting orbital srtiked. Screw turret bases.
---
I thought you said lever action first tho lmao. Which has better base damage with a hardened reciever? I had a two shot handmade but sold it to a vendor tbh. 
---
Ill add u later
---
It's your mods
---
Many times people with bounties are bait. They get their high level partied friends to kill you after you kill them and flag yourself for pvp.
---
Yeah, I grabbed some razor grain to take back to my CAMP. I got stuck defending a workshop and when I returned it was gone 
---
No I am not denying that you can alter builds. Your confusion clearly shows that you would be fine with having a rifle build with 1 PER, or a melee build with 1 STR, or sneak build with 1 AGI, etc. Good luck seeing success with any of those builds.
---
I am on a completely new install
---
Thank You!! I really appreciate the thourough response.
---
That would scare the shit out of me lol
---
The Condition (CND) is how long until the fermentable alcohol goes Vintage. You're basically waiting for it to 'spoil' and the Fermenter speeds up that timer.

Pretty sure there‚Äôs a crate full next to one of the uranium generators in uranium fever

Yeah, but I mean my whole house floats, so...

I just got a two shot gauss the other day from drops.
---
You forgot the /s at the end so it makes it look like you were being serious. 
---
Ha, I have the same thing, except a behemoth slam explosion, which appears like a huge boulder
---
To elaborate, if you move your camp you will have your entire camp blueprint in the ‚Äústored‚Äù tab when you rebuild. If you have a complicated or wide base that won‚Äôt place where you want you have the option to delete that blueprint, which puts all of the individual parts in your ‚Äústored‚Äù tab instead. I‚Äôve rebuilt this way so many times... but I‚Äôd much rather edit my complex/wide base :)
---
Except at higher levels, scorchbeats take 2 seconds...
---
Will try again. So frustrating
---
Don't even bother dealing with them as they are bullet sponges and don't really give anything worthwhile.  I only deal with them if they are in the way and I need to do something in the area.  If they dropped plans regularly, I'd be really interested. Random junk and meat aren't worth the bullets or time to get.

When you place IN A WORKSHOP ONLY then instead of the basic teleport to the workshop when you teleport you spawn where the mat was placed

It was in the corpse flower event.  I don't remember the exact name but I believe it had corpse flower in title.  It was Northwest of vault 76 when I did it but I think it can be anywhere in Forest region.

Not sure about the ban stuff, but with that much ammo, is it possible that carry  weight become an issue even with weight reduction perks? 
---
Yea. But stable went from 30 to 100
---
I'd mostly play the single player version with third party mods instead of relying on Bethseda to 'improve' the game.
---
I happen to really like the fact that there is a cost to fast travel.  It really makes me think sometimes before doing it...which is good.  It encourages exploration.

Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. They already have owner-only permissions for moving/editing CAMP assets.

I've got a new one- you can't inspect items from vendors anymore to see what the other two legendary traits are.

Have the people that say marry her in every thread ever had sex? The answer to both is no.

Haha and now I'm locked inside my panic room lol

What platform are you playing on?
---
Mods were broken this patch. 
---
The penitentiary patrol quest you're referring to right? Just to be sure. Thanks anyway for checking friend!
---
After 20+ hours of the last quest you ran for him.
---
That‚Äôs an issue with mods, although not mods specifically- it‚Äôs your custom.ini that needs to be updated with the new files. I forget exactly what, but search around, there‚Äôs plenty of info out there on what to add.
---
There's Mr Handy fuel behind the Red Rocket in Flatwoods, iirc. Just don't pick it up and then scrap it, if you plan on using it for the weapon. 
---
Depends.  I‚Äôve played 3, NV and 4.  Wasn‚Äôt interested in MP.  I‚Äôm lvl 120 and have enjoyed playing solo.  I think I‚Äôm interested now to get in some MP in like for example joining someone on a team to do a nuke run who‚Äôs never launched.  That might be fun for me.  Note though you can do it solo as I did.  I‚Äôm on PC with IGN same as here.
---
naw there's holes around the map as well. i play on console with a few buddies of mine and weve been experiencing this since the new patch
---
Oh that‚Äôs wild! I would love to see what yours looks like.  
---
i know i don't have one of those i don't have any mods or anything like that because this is a new install
---
Definitely spoiling faster and requiring more food and water. Smallest of things making me hate this game right now. Why do we need to eat 12x a day and drink 100 gallons of water?? Also food spoilage. I picked some razorgrain, made Mika‚Äôs home for the quest and fast traveled to my camp with 14 extra to plant. Already spoiled. 
---
Hi there... I don't want to start a whole thread...but I think I saw something strange occur.
---
I was adding a bunch more things to my base and there down on the ground below my base - at the area where you spawn with fast travel, I saw what looked like a set of plans lying on the ground.  Except, it was in a red folder.
---
So I hopped down and went to take a look and ALMOST picked it up... It was "Technical Data".  But I've never seen Technical Data lying around... only ever in loot... what's more, the option was "Steal"...
---
IT'S A TRAAAPPPP!!!!111 was the first thing I thought and I started checking everywhere to see if someone had dropped it...but then... brown bags... so how exactly did a folder-like Technical Data end up on the floor at my CAMP's spawn point?
---
Yup 
---
Shaka, when the walls fell üò¢
---
Just tell him no
---
I got it but I have not tried it nor installed it yet ^^'
---
I modded skyrim once again and well, I'm waiting for fo76 to be stable before starting my playthrough
---
Sorry
---
I was in a nuke zone and couldn‚Äôt even harvest any.  I just kept begging the regular flora.  
---
They not working right anyway.
---
I wonder why.
---
It was ok to sell those things as they were.
---
Why reduce one and disable another from being sold????
---
We need money to buy stuff so it shouldn't be hard to get money
---
Your better off just taking one of the power plant workshops
---
A Dog. We need Dogs.
---
Guess I'm getting all the Fasnacht masks....my wallet is already crying.
---
I did and still kept trying to buy it so i blocked for session
---
Robot, called Insult Bot. Wander around a bit, you might find him.
---
Yeah I haven't been able to get Camden Daily for 2 days now sigh.
---
Add to the list "no object selected" when I try to place some objects. I have to toggle out of build mode and back in, then suddenly I can place the object. Took several minutes to figure this out. And I still have grass, dirt and tree branches coming through the walls and floor. 
---
Loving the bigger budget, though!!
---
What level are you? Because they have more of a damage resistance than their non-scorched brethren
---
I‚Äôve killed numerous scorched creatures with different weapons. They‚Äôre just quite strong and take a while to kill. Scorched beasts are harder to kill when they‚Äôre flying, but when they land you can generally get better hits on them as they‚Äôre not out of range 
---
Spoiler alert:  Secret Fallout 76 is hiding is&gt;! There is no secret! !&lt;
---
Oki doki loki
---
How do you normally get the plans anywho?
---
Thank you so much I must have missed that post 
---
46. But shouldn't I be able to do even minuscule levels of damage?
---
What‚Äôs your weapon?
---
Ask and you shall receive! [heres a post I made, with a video](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a75lcj/behemoth_hit_me_so_hard_he_put_his_attack/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
lol - story of my life! Yeah, you'll need another switch or terminal on the inside to get back out again :D
---
Bethesda could create a new super mutant npc as your wife.  You wake up in one of the churches to an amorous super mutant who informs you of your wedding to him and starts saying sweet nothings.
---
I have the same problem too and I am also loving the budget increase!!
---
A level 40 tactical hardened combat rifle. I've also used frags and plasma grenades to no effect
---
I've been lucky enough to have weapons that specifically cause damage to scorched. Before I switch, it really looks like I'm hitting them with a tissue paper.
---
Yes same problem on PC, using Xbox 360 controller. 
---
It doesn't work with stable flux either. Probably a balance thing? 
---
When did you stop playing? Turrets are still very easy to defeat. Explosive weapons were nerfed heavily. However, there are still some very powerful rifles and a bloodied build can still do massive amounts of damage with the right weapons and perks. That being said, everyone is beatable. What level and what kind of build are you going for?
---
It‚Äôs probably a bug then, I can kill them just fine with a similar lever action, just try restarting your platform and relogging.
---
Then look at the custom ini's and see what is different.
---
Better Inventory has been updated
---
Everything, including that link, assumes that it was created because they said they created it. There was no in-game sequence showing its creation. WT could have falsified documents stating its origin. You see what I mean?
---
This would be an absolute game changer for me for my camp.
---
/golfclap 
---
I posted about something similar the other day unfortunately I can‚Äôt get back in the game glad to know you figured out exactly what it was
---
Yes that will get you suspended 
---
I got suspended for under 50k ultracite 5.56.   Never used any exploits whatsoever.  Traded two legendary weapons for the ammo and was banned.  Or rather suspended.  My character weight is never over 280 and my stash stayed around 550 .  
---
I‚Äôve stopped taking trade requests. Usually the other player just wants to buy my main weapon or outfit. 
---
The strong point I think they were trying to bank on lasers is their large magazine capacity and slightly faster fire rate.  It's what.. 30 shots? That's 10 extra from the default of a combat rifle or handmade, but fusion cells are a little more uncommon as an ammo, not as much as some other types, but definitely not as easily accessible as .45 for example.  I think the fire rate is tied with the handmade.  Also, are laser rifles generally lighter than a combat rifle? I get the feeling if anything, the laser rifle is supposed to kind of just be a lighter alternative to the combat rifle, but you'd expect more from an energy weapon.
---
Not sure about their VATS action point economy, since maybe they could be worthy there too, but I dunno.  Either way, laser rifles are kind of always going to be in a weak spot so long as high-level enemies have near equal defense for energy and ballistic damage.  I believe a colonel Gutsy has 110 ballistic, and 100 energy defense, which is silly, since it's a robot, and metal armor is supposed to be susceptible to energy damage.
---
Lasers could really use some damage-boosting receivers, or just give them inherent piercing capabilities.  Also, the sniper barrel on this thing sucks.  It increases damage, but it requires you to wait for 3 lights on the barrel to light up.  And it takes like 3 seconds after each shot to get to that point.  If you shoot before that, you're doing less-than-normal damage.  Plus if you put a reflex sight or scope on it, it obscures the charge meter, so you can't even see it anymore.

Honestly I killed three the first time I went to Whitespring in probably December, and don‚Äôt even know how I killed the fourth one about three weeks ago.
---
Sokath! His eyes uncovered!
---
Yeah, you're showing your age, but I saw them too so that's showing my age as well. 
---
I only kill them out of a sense that my character has a direct interest in killing them for the sake of the world. It would be really nice if they dropped loot to reflect that motivation.
---
I have seen legendary radrats, which makes no damn sense when comparing it to scorchbeasts.
---
Happened to me today.
---
Happened to me everytime is try lately.  
---
I have heard that some people can launch one though.  But I can't either I hate it 
---
Yes that's the quest. I've never triggered it myself. I always got it by hopping. Seeing if it was active then hopping again. If you enter the prison it can trigger it too. I got them well over Lvl 100. I will let you know as soon as I can. 
---
There are two events that happen there patrol is the one you want. I'm almost 100% certain
---
Haha yeah
---
I can't launch either it sucks bad 
---
Missile turrets do not make short work of scorchbeasts, it is actually the other way around. Scorchbeasts own turrets.
---
I think something got crossed up with legendary enemies and enemies in general. I went to a few different locations last night and in a short time came across multiple 3* enemies, only 1 dropped 3* loot. In an hour in a half of play time i would normally be lucky to see a single 3* enemy. Also, enemies are sporadically spawning at very low levels. I was at west tek by myself and all super mutants spawned at level 5 or 10. It was by far the quickest run I've made through west tek.
---
Wait, the end game area of the game would become the end game area of the game? Make it so!
---
I don't know off hand the base damage...But the lever has more than the std. Handmade. Even with the Hardened receiver the lever does more damage. I would love a tS or TSE handmade tho, sounds like a heap of fun
---
That was awesome!  Thanks!  
---
I understand you are trying to help but I don't have a custom ini file or any additional files in my data folder
---
It just seems so odd. Automatic receivers typically lower Vats costs. It feels like that's where the developers are trying to push you towards. Damage is lower on automatic weapons so it made sense you would be able to chain multiple of them together to make up for the lower damage.
---
And still, yeah, if anything it was a bug, but they call it an exploit in the patch notes.
---
Good. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äútrick‚Äù as you so casually put it. It‚Äôs an exploit that wasn‚Äôt meant to be able to happen and they fixed it. And now here you are asking the community of they‚Äôve found new exploits so you can cheat again. Is it minor and inconsequential? Probably, but it‚Äôs still an exploit. 
---
Given that the entire storyline involves how we should be killing them off I am 100% okay with people being interested in farming them instead of the ghouos at whitesprings
---
This bug sucks so bad lol.  
---
You have to replace that line *up to a point*.
---
So mine looks like:
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, **BetterInventory.ba2, ChatMod.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2**
---
Where it's bolded is where the copy and paste ends.  They cite the mods I'm loading, which isn't in the text above.  Does that make sense?
---
Yep it seems like they did the same thing all around the map my legendary run isn‚Äôt the same anymore
---
This has got to be the best post I've seen in months. Bravo!
---
Makes sense, with green thumb I'd be swamped in the things after a run through a nuke zone selling them was a way too easy way to get caps.
---
Where the fuck's the purveyor?
---
To be honest the best idea IS vault 76 you can‚Äôt nuke anything around it (to the point where it is in the blast radius even if you could they could just fix that) and it means players can boot up the game for the first time and see a vault sprawling with little stands and players walking around hell make it a no comat zone so no level 200s go trying to force the level 10s to give em everything at a discount vault 76 is the best spot as it is a place everyone will probably agree is one of like 3 locations that even have a chance to do this and two of which are actual viable
---
Learn to build. 
---
Wish I would have seen this yesterday
---
I had finished all of that moving on to the next part. 
---
If you guys noticed, every time we log out or switching servers we always lose our food / drink / rest buff too...
---
The endgame IS farming legendaries
---
Oh boy here I go again. 
---
You didn‚Äôt properly read the roadmap man....
---
Just you. He was quite loud for me. 
---
I just saw and did it. Woohoo
---
So you didn‚Äôt actually read the roadmap huh? Go reread it. 
---
For the love of god. READ THE ROAD MAP. 
---
I would pay money for this in the Atom store Bethesda!
---
tbh you couldve just left server and saved your camp/caps. it was your decision to fight. although, i do think with the new pacifist fix, that should make your CAMP untouchable. But it doesnt sound like you were even in pacifist. 
---
You wanna trade in that fake news for real news? Best I can do is $2.57 or 5 bucks store credit. 
---
How were they forcing you into combat? And why didn‚Äôt you just server hop?
---
Does your luck have a play in it. My luck is very high and I've only seen full ones. 
---
Yes, its ugly as hell and i cant believe that didn't fix it when they bought it over from fo4. There were even mods that i would use to fix it
---
Unfortunately it‚Äôs a PVP game. Hopefully Bethesda will implement PVP only servers to give people the choice to fight or not. It‚Äôs sucks getting your stuff destroyed and being killed all the time.
---
I‚Äôm sorry people suck ):
---
I just wanted the VTU Jacket &amp; Jeans and the Tin foil hat. It took me 6 server hops lol
---
For sure I love the series I was just saying it's a frustration for some people. 
---
They can't do that, having a crippled game is incredible job security for the dev team
---
Yeah just server hop when you've got 3 workshops.
---
Or, they could stop the two shot explosive dumabsses from 1 shotting people 
---
Literally read it fuckwit, all it says is content starting to roll out the 12th (now the 13th because delay), with a dev post stating the anticipated delayed release of survival mode.  
---
I actually can't speak to the craftable CAMP turrets because I have not / not yet able to craft those. But that red BOS turret, I just stood there behind it while it shot up those SB's. It broke multiple times but I just hit x to repair and boom, back in action.
---
Death blossoms gg lol
---
Gorge junkyard produces concrete
---
STARTING to roll out. It says may 23rd for the legendary vendor......
---
I showed up at the location of one of those suicide cults.
---
Guess the drink really WAS something powerful.
---
Still not working for me...
---
Yes I‚Äôve wanted this for so long 
---
It's probably too hard for them to fix this bug (OR it is intended). They didn't even fix the bulk scrap issue and it's been 3 weeks since the bug appeared.
---
lol they nerfed tse a long time ago.. they probably werent even two shots, probably anti-armour or something a lot stronger + a good build. if you didnt wanna leave you couldve just taken the loss on your CAMP and kept running your workshop, but chances are they would‚Äôve came for those too. 
---
i got on last night, did the new quest in about 20 minutes. it really could have taken 10 minutes though if you hurry.. 13gb patch.
---
Now only if I had this last week. I wanted to keep the Marsupial Mutation.
---
Your playing a BoS character and the other party refuses to surrender their high tech weapons.
---
Each pic has release date......
---
I just crafted a TON of flux after raiding two nuke zones. Defiantly had super duper proc.
---
Can‚Äôt speak for brews though, 
---
Exactly, Bethesda made the VTU Jacket and Jeans a guaranteed spawn, however there‚Äôs so many players going there and taking it, that you have to server hop a lot to you want the loot.
---
Damn it Todd
---
This guy was not beatable even hitting him with my hardest hitting dragon he would not die, he would take dmg and then instantly be back to full health over and over and over, while he would sit there killing everything with no issue, a build? Just a rifle dmg build PA as well, nothing special I spose?
---
Fallout 4 for me. Saw a wrench today at work and almost scooped it up for that mechanic in Vault 81...
---
I am a sandwich.
---
Thanks for the tip. Do you know, are the cores you get for taking a workshop always 100% full?
---
The Helvetica event is next week on Tuesday 
---
No. It would NOT be ok for a non cosmetic item to be atom shop only. Don't encourage that type of business practices
---
Thank YOU for reporting back to us. Unlike the Bioware devs at Anthem, you guys actually seem to be listening to the community and I've noticed a lot of positive changes over the last few patches. Very impressive. Thank you to you and the whole squad over there. Lol.
---
Maybe if you could tag a specific food and/or drink to be automatically consumed when your stat gets low. Still lets people play with their aid but doesn't distract you in the middle of a SBQ battle...
---
You‚Äôre finally awake?
---
Yes they are
---
Posting a question post wanting an answer and then proceed to call people fuckwit when they do. Bravo!
---
Don‚Äôt even bother.. nukes are broken.. just tried and have a 182 hour cooldown message
---
It was a hoot, to be sure. Next one will be going back to the trivia game show format, with a twist, and of course, the HOA will definitely let the home office know. 
---
Thanks for checking us out, we're having too much fun with this nonsense. 
---
:)
---
Since patch I‚Äôve had legendaries drop drills, syringers and nothing at all. üòû
---
Adrenal reaction was returned to its old values, which didn‚Äôt go as high when you were super low. I believe it caps at 60% bonus damage, whereas for the duration of patch 6 it could go up to something over 100% bonus if you were under 10%.
---
Can‚Äôt speak to food though. 
---
Was meant to be a sarcastic joke, however kombucha is easily doable at home and it does have its benefits (or so the hippies say). Honestly it isn‚Äôt bad and it‚Äôs a great non-alcoholic beverage that is brewed. Perhaps they will include it in further iterations if the brewing / fermenting system. Vodka and whiskey probably are still king, however. 
---
You're right it is lighter in weight, I forgot to mention that. And it has no magazine options, the Combat rifle can get up to 25 and the Handmade to like 70. I'd honestly be ok with the damage as is, if they would at least bring the durability up to an acceptable level and give it proper armor penetration.
---
This got pretty toxic
---
I would like a sentry bot companion named hellga with an angry school bus driver lady voice please
---
I mentioned this in another thread, but I had the same experience yesterday: Gutsies spawning from the robot pods. Not a slew of them coming from out of nowhere, but actively spawning from the pods in lieu of the normal Protectrons, etc. I had the other encounter happen afterwards outside of the train station. It was a banner day.
---
Oh this is gonna happen the instant I get home
---
Oh, and, there‚Äôs no getting drunk on kombucha, at least to my knowledge. You‚Äôd have to drink a lot and you‚Äôd probably get sick of it first. .5% is on the high end of it and even that is very low. Just have a beer.  
---
Sounds like something a synth would say
---
You do you comrade.
---
He uses it, so no
---
That lack of clan/guild functionalality baffles me so much
---
Hindsight is a great thing. I reckon many of us did the same. 
---
I struck lucky though, I found most items of the max level at vendors, so I just bought them. It's worth keeping an eye out, you never know.
---
It's probably because of the budget cost decrease for lights and turrets.
---
It‚Äôs just NW of the lookout tower. If you want to know what‚Äôs going on, go back, notice all the bottles around, and then have a look on the shelves inside the pulpit.
---
Not quite. It‚Äôs just NW of the lookout tower. If you want to know what‚Äôs going on, go back, notice all the bottles around, and then have a look on the shelves inside the pulpit.
---
Yes I did read that the scrapper perk is now a lot more effective. Apparently having high INT also effects the amount of scrap you get. 
---
I used to get 11 steel from an assault rifle or combat rifle, how much can I expect now?
---
Id love to be a ghoul like the F4 grouls, but it would need downsides too for balance.. eg whitesprings bots always agro to you, go through water and food faster but take no rads from eating/drinking, become more easily addicted to chems etc.
---
the lemonade stand is a new ‚Äúrandom spawning‚Äù vendor, which has recipes to make lemonade for decent buffs. it‚Äôs literally looks like an old school, child-run lemonade stand haha. 
---
I think that's the first time anyone's acknowledged my username. Thank you
---
I was hoping to see a fix for the Rocketsuit texture, but I guess since it's off the store now I'll never be able to use it. Great
---
I tried twice last night on two different servers and both said 260 hours till cooldown . After eating my keycards
---
That would be a ASAM and I wish as someone RPing as a BoS revivalist I could build one in a camp because scorchbeasts just demolish player camps close to instantly. Craftable turrets just die to Scorchbeasts
---
I might be wrong but if you own workshops they could have had a fourth team member contest a workshop which would immediately force you into PVP with the rest of the team who was there at your camp waiting.  
---
I think they should only force you into PVP if you‚Äôre at the actual workshop giving you the option to just walk away but it is how it is I guess.  
---
Haha np, and i agree with you in reality, i just would really like to see it implemented.
---
It does. I'll try it out. In my case there was a backup ini file (basically a cookie not in this folder) that my game was using.
---
Yup, I would gladly pay money for a costumes/skins for my pet since I see it all the time. If you play in First Person View you only see your gun so I don‚Äôt buy costumes or masks, tattoos or hairstyles.
---
Ahhh okay thank you!
---
Harper's is kind of a pain in the ass, but at this point I just account for it by grabbing things from the stash before heading there. The other spot that really, really needs on is the vendor bot at Camden Park. I found myself overencumbered the other day after running Breach and Clear, looked at the map, and decided to hike to Camden. After I got there I realized the vendor was out of caps for the day, and AFAIK there's no benches there, so I ended up hiking all the way up to the farm supply store west of the Nuka plant so I could scrap some stuff.
---
Is this real?
---
White spring is still pretty good for xp and caps, Charleston capitol (inside) is also really good for glowing ones. In terms of flora I‚Äôm not too sure
---
You forget to mention the UI bug when trying to inspect items. The left panel that‚Äôs supposed to display item stats appears blank. In order to fix it you have to inspect the item again.
---
thanks!
---
You're not the only one. Based on the numbers I'd say there are well over 10k players who were wrongly banned. Wrongly banned meaning they may have inadvertently taken advantage of duped items, but never actually duped. In their minds they did nothing wrong, but technically they did. The severity of the punishment is not matching the "crime". 
---
Please be aware I am not on Bethesda's side in any way. I just try to spread the knowledge I've gathered to support the community.
---
They better have this fixed before the event starts
---
A) it would not take them thirty mins to destroy your cap. 
---
B) you can‚Äôt be forced into PvP, you retaliated and get crushed by more experienced better equipped players
---
C) you could have easily logged out as soon as they attacked and lost next to nothing besides some building materials. 
---
D) publicly cry about game mechanics that have been in game since day 1 some more it‚Äôll help...
---
I usually get some frogs outside my camp but that is pretty much it.
---
Scorchbeasts are the reason why I stopped playing this game. I hate them. 
---
Not just razorgrain but all of the CAMP pieces that have collision and wont sink into the ground. It makes camp design way too difficult in some otherwise prime spots.
---
What if we put the GE in the wilderness?
---
@180 hrs here, still hangin' tough...
---
I never even noticed them when I was in earlier! 
---
Mind you I was likely still in amazement at the amount of stash boxes in the enclave bunker.
---
\^\^\^
---
Also, most people who play a game with RPG aspects to have their replaying as part of the gameplay. If I wanted to roleplay in my head I'm play a tabletop RPG like DnD.
---
I really like this.
---
Uhh.. the liberators were dropped into the US by the Chinese gorvernment themselves so yeah I would expect them to speak Chinese
---
My guess would be the devs initially put this in to be changed later, but was overlooked before launch and still hasn't been caught in testing because I imagine nobody really checks the subtitles. 
---
It didn't give you your keycards back? Now that sucks.
---
Nukashine questline and effects are awesome, super well done. And of course building a moonshining shack is a fun roleplay element. Plus I find it runs smoother and now that all the "Fuck Bethesda" people are gone, the active players are very helpful and kind. It's definitely getting better. Also, welcome back brother/sister
---
They don‚Äôt and they can be killed by other players.
---
Unyielding with Ultralight mods. 2 pieces have acrobat, appropriately the legs. I‚Äôve got a bit of perception and agility scattered around as secondaries.
---
I have a Chamelon piece as well, I only throw it on for PvP though. 
---
WTB pixels
---
Yeah came in yesterday‚Äôs update
---
So are saying it doesnt work for your CAMP but only a claimed workshop?
---
What if I just collect water and skip collecting water water? 
---
Nice camp looks like we are neighbors. Welcome to the cliff. Happy hunting.
---
Dont know why, but this honestly feels like a joke 
---
What was your health? They reverted Adrenal Reaction back to pre-patch 6 values. Patch 6 had insane bonuses once you got below 10% health, even 20% was higher than before. 
---
how are people by-passing this? i recently joined a nuked lobby and was wondering how.. cus ive seen this same problem going around everywhere
---
I have no idea.. wasted a keycard 
---
Frig of ricky
---
&gt;It would be fun to wake up with 5 supermutants warlords around
---
Like that meme of the porn star on the couch surround by 5 big black dudes?
---
&gt;and we don't even get a translation seems odd.  
---
Immersion. Do you know Chinese? How else would you know what they're saying?
---
Ok. Sorry I couldn't help more. Good luck.
---
The liberators speak Chinese. You can hear them speaking Chinese around you. Beth didn't put a translation in the subtitles. Perhaps someone that speaks the language will translate. I'm sure whatever they are saying is kinda funny
---
In Fallout 4 you can meet a ghoul who was part of the Chinese navy before the bombs dropped.
---
He's the commander of the nuclear submarine that launched the weapon over Boston. The Chinese were the ones who kicked off the end of the eastern US, so it's only logical that their machines would live on after the loss of their soldiers.
---
Or just use the brahmin pen at your camp and have your own
---
Animal House? Man those were just references to modern day WVU frats haha
---
Thank you.  It's nice to know it's a popular area.  I always enjoy seeing other camps in the area.
---
wow thats dumb.. surprised they havent hotfixed it by now.. saw some people saying they did that so Morgantown wont be nuked.. for the new quests 
---
I assume you‚Äôre gone?
---
Well u will have to wait till he gives u that recipe then 
---
I love having to eat or drink, and making us do it more often is fine. It's the fact that you need to eat 4-10 steaks and drink 1-2 gallons of water to fill up
---
... I don‚Äôt even know how you can ask that question. 
---
You‚Äôre comparing two secondaries.
---
One does 10% more damage, only while aiming.
---
Once does 20% more damage, all the time, in an AoE, and can be increased to 32% more with a perk (demo expert).
---
Ask me again which one you should pick.
---
Still no daily for me either. 
---
If I had bad stuff then so be it but if someone unknowingly picks up something how do they get rid of it since dumping it doesn‚Äôt work? 
---
Bethesda also removed items from players leaving them one of the duped items and let them play on.
---
We know many dupers are still playing on their main accounts and still selling, ain‚Äôt no way all these 3 star legendary stuff is still and has been for sale considering many high level players hardly have ever gotten anything like a 3 star TSE Weapon... yet there are many for sale. 
---
I hope they address this, if I‚Äôm guilty of having it I take my punishment but there has to be a method in which players can dump stuff if they get it and not get banned. 
---
My push to talk button only works half the time when pressed even after changing the key. 
---
Nope, we‚Äôre still here. Come on down!
---
Yup, totally agree with this. 
---
Thanks for trying I just been really frustrated with this mess lol
---
Nuke holotape says all three are clear when you get the 240 hour cooldown bs.   You won't know until you get to the end.  Tried twice last night and wasted my time 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aa3c2e/how_to_significantly_increas_framerate_and_reduce/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
This was a game changer for me. 
---
Yeah I know it‚Äôs not the best picture.  Sorry.
---
I wish servers were a little more populated and wish people didnt get scared off by anyone level 100+
---
Glowing blood
---
I wish trade windows only displayed what you're willing to trade, not the whole inventory. 
---
I wondered how I got so much steel scrap today.
---
I closed the game out &amp; restarted my console. Haven‚Äôt had an issue since. 
---
It all floats in fallout 76...you‚Äôll float too
---
im there now I can hear water on the other side idk whats inside 
---
Anyone who camps at the Whitesprings Golf Club is a dick.
---
I shot him in the face last night, because he kept repeating himself and following me, it gave me a not saying I'd been insulted. Fun times indeed
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if the new quests started I assume... in 182 hours the new quests will still be there
---
Does the one to see if Bethesda stealthily nerfing posted too?
---
It didnt take them 30 minutes for them to destroy my camp. They stood around for 30 minutes. I'm still with them right now. There's literally 6 of them now. All hanging around my camp destroying shit and attacking me.
---
Agreed. My camp is currently out in the middle of nowhere and I don't want to move to flatwoods or whitespring just to be able to sell stuff.
---
As someone else mentioned in the comments, a beacon could work well with this.
---
So I guess I can also fix it by uninstalling my mods for now?
---
Good shout, deffo worth doing if you want lots of milk lol
---
Yep definitely don‚Äôt drink all the whiskey lol, there‚Äôs so much drinking in these challenges I‚Äôve had to spend some points on the professional drinker perk lol
---
Posts like this prove to me that a lot of people don‚Äôt pay attention to the story or read terminals . 
---
how exactly would your character automatically know chinese 
---
Easily 100+ times. 10 minutes spent on that event easily gets me enough crap to clean out all 7 vendors, plus a net gain of 150-200 shotgun shells.
---
Also, even though the gear is capped at 40 I still find useful things. When it comes to armor, the damage resistance doesn't get that much better between 40-50, so I'm more focused on the effects. The other day I got a level 40 3* combat armor leg with Assassin, +1 STR, and -20% ammo weight. I'll take that over a trash 1 or 2* level 50 piece any day.
---
But I have a spot just outside my front door where I will sink up to my chest in the ground
---
No one is talking about, what I find to be, THE most annoying thing about gatling plasma/ gatling laser. 
---
Every time I whip out any gatling plasma or laser my clip ammo always matches my # of cores. Even if I pull one out and load up a fresh core and then switch to something else and back again, it still will have the same two numbers for my ammo. Has anybody else noticed this or is it just me???
---
Really annoying having to reload before I can use any of my heavy energy weapons, especially since they're not quick to reload (yes I am aware of the perk that speeds this up)
---
When I heard him I was thinking it's Tony Plana (Glottis - Grim Fandango).
---
Yeah, this has bothered me sine the day I started playing Fallout 4.
---
they are adding a no-pvp restriction "survival" mode.
---
For the longest time this happened to me when fast traveling to my camp, I too have experienced the sink.
---
It has a number?
---
I think you're slightly missing the point. It's about gaining permanence of workshops while retaining balance. It's great that you have everything 'YOU' think 'you' need right within grasp, but why not have an area that you can upgrade over time, gaining another sink for caps and time? So, you know, a chap like me who works for a living and has a family has an option of doing all of the things you've listed in a fraction of the time? 
---
Or an emoji that tells them "free shit".
---
Luck *does* affect condition of items you find,i don't know if it extends to cores but I imagine it would. 
---
He‚Äôs too powerful 
---
I've got my dog armor stashed since the earlier day I found it in eager anticipation of dogmeat 2.0
---
YES
---
Would love to be a ghoul so I could go into nuke zones without PA.  But it would need trade offs like radiation heals but you take additional damage or something.  Likewise becoming a Supermutant by consuming FEV would be really cool.  Like increased melee damage but lowers intelligence and you can't wear PA or something similar.  But I think both would have to be permanent changes per the lore...
---
still doesnt give any screws :(
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was 20% thanks!
---
Dude. Calm down. You sound crazy.
---
Okay.
---
There‚Äôs a lot to look at here, but I‚Äôll focus on your complaints of getting killed. Do you have reactive mutations? Unstable isotope, electrically charged? At least for electrically charged, I‚Äôve confirmed a Wanted player can get you into PVP with them if they hit you and it strikes them back. Doesn‚Äôt happen with Reactive plates. I haven‚Äôt personally checked Welded Rebar or Unstable isotope, but I‚Äôd be cautious of either of those. 
---
If you eliminate the reactive damage from your character, they can‚Äôt force you into PvP (unless you own workshops...) and thus can‚Äôt do anything more than slap damage (5hp/second). 
---
Okay. As long as you opened the floor to places dicks CAMP, I fucking hate when people CAMP near the pond  at the Charleston train station. 
---
It‚Äôs a random encounter point. Sometimes the Responderbot Vender strolls by. 
---
It's been 24 hours since I completed the initial quest to unlock the brewing station. I've been talking to him a bunch periodically. No daily given yet.
---
I solo all the time no problem! Its fun
---
Firstly get you butt to a stash box right away. 
---
you will have little luck just walking up to people because most people playing the game are not interested in pvp. 
---
if you dont have a mic then it will take you longer to find someone and convince them to kill you to kill you. good luck wastelander.
---
Just a tip if you do play again, grab all the ionized meat in nuke zones. Doesnt spoil, and 2 fill an entire health bar. 
---
I just came to grab some TD and saw it...  Holly shit
---
If you like the Fallout 4 gunplay and exploration you'll like this game. The negativity at launch was blown out of proportion.
---
This looks like an ‚Äúexample Player C.A.M.P.‚Äù. I wouldn‚Äôt bother looking for it in game. It‚Äôs like the demo scenes in the atom shop.
---
Thx4thesaddness
---
There is a normal cooldown for a single person launching a nuke (I can't remember exactly, 1hr?) and then there is the bugged (for some people) cooldown this patch to which I referred to.
---
I would just love to have planter boxes
---
Have you tried moving the camp?
---
I was too, it sounds like only the new recipes can go vintage (currently)
---
which platform
---
It procted for me making stable crimson flux this morning, so it does still work for flux.
---
I thought it might be! Bad press at every turn, I did see their first expansion drop was delayed (if only by a day) so I was concerned the issues may not be over 
---
Lol I've gone on a couple different rants about this in the podcast I cohost. Nice to see it finally get some broader recognition (AKA Bethesda come sub to our cast plz, we have good ideas. Promise &lt;3 ) 
---
There's a watch tower near west tek that has functional planters on all the stair landings, so it's already doable in the game 
---
Hi. I have both Arms and Wetsuit plans to sell.
---
On PS4. Will only be available tomorrow evening GMT
---
I wonder when the Times New Roman event will be
---
The loneliness, yeah.  Fallout 76 is a very lonely game.  The servers can't accommodate enough people to fulfil Bethesda's promise of 'every person you see will be a player' and all other Human NPCs are dead.  The robots are nice enough, but they don't really do anything apart from vending or giving quests.
---
The thing about Fallout 76 is that it doesn't matter what you do, *you've already lost*.  This is post-apocalypse in a much more real sense than in the past Fallout games--you aren't doing anything for anyone but yourself.  You're not making the world a better or a worse place for settlers, companions and so forth, because everyone that isn't a robot or an enemy is dead.  The fact that this is an online game means that nothing actually changes, either--you don't actually defeat the scorched, because whatever you do they're always there.
---
I like this game and I really want to immerse myself in it, but wandering the wasteland by yourself and simply being a witness to the devastation, in my mind, makes it a really complex walking simulator.  You're on your own, you're doing everything for yourself and whatever you do isn't going to make a difference.
---
Companions would mean a lot, especially for players that can't team up for whatever reason.  But I wonder if it would actually change that loneliness much.  Dunno.
---
Thanks for this, definitely helpful. Returning player here, level 40, and was wondering if I should just restart? I have a stealth build and for some reason, even with a black powder gun, i can two shot a lvl 62 legendary, and then take 30 shots to take down a level 24 assaultron. On tough fights the stealth doesn't help me at all, and i end up going into my power armor to survive. Its fun, today i solo'd a lvl 65 Scorchbeast that randomly spawned in Watago, then spawned like 3 more times everytime i tried to complete the Mayor quest. Had to get in my power armor and take potshots with my pistol, took an hour, and now i feel like i want to play a PA build with heavy guns, but have all the wrong perks for it. I know after level 50 i can start reallocating points but not sure if this process would be painful since leveling takes me pretty long. Advice? My planned power armor/heavy gun build is gonna be https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwoBAgMMBQ4BAQEAKE8DLQF6ASMD8gEDxgED7gEDQQPgAQMLA5kBA8oBA4gBA4kBA3EDcwOsAQHqAQNJAtIBAgA=

Yup it sure helps. Before I moved in with .y girlfriend I would game like you. I put thousands of hours in skate 3 and Fallout 4. Now I have a baby and I'm lucky to get a quest done after I tinker in my camp for 30 mins. 
---
I'm just jealous tbh.
---
Can't help you but I like your restaurant
---
This is good stuff. I made the changes he suggested back when this was posted, haven't looked back. 
---
No. But it‚Äôs default mag holds 30, which is among the highest for default mags for any rifle-type gun. Laser rifles have the same size.
---
But it has zero muzzle and scope mods :(

I have noticed I'm basically always hungry/thirsty since patch but i thought i was just forgetting to eat. Also glowing meat all spoiled before i even made it to camp, good to hear ot wasn't just me.
---
I'm good on screws, always running out of steel tho, this is good.
---
‚ÄòMilking your brahmin‚Äô is what all the kids call it these days. For real, though, my Brahmin tried to kick me when I milked it. Not sure if it does that every time.

The C.A.M.P. object functions as a sort of welcome mat I believe
---
You're like a Comic Sans the humor
---
Actually really sad they patched that. Like I guess that's a total game breaker for them? 
---
A non-non-player character? NNPC?
---
Is it just double? I haven‚Äôt checked 308, but baseline 308 with ammosmith is like 21; someone was telling me ultracite 308 crafts in 81!
---
Im On my way!
---
They aren't.
---
Ok what's your screen name? Mine is unclemartypp7 
---
Zing.
---
I read this in a darlek voice
---
Thank you! It looks soo much better in its current form. I‚Äôm currently battling with the green blueprint that can‚Äôt be place because it is but isn‚Äôt intersecting something.
---
I‚Äôd tell you to stop by for some of my Granny‚Äôs famous cranberry cobbler but,  I‚Äôm having issues. 
---
Can you expand? What specifically do you have issues with? Sorry, 0 experience with the game 
---
The first time I fired a Gatling gun it blew the arm right off of a bloated ghoul - it was love at first sight.
---
Camp Venture, in the cellar room where you turn in Technical Data.
---
Cool dude... pretty home-y
---
Am a brother LOL i got FO76 back after getting bored af on Hitman 2
---
Same here.  Remapping did nothing. 
---
What's your screen name mine is UncleMartypp7
---
Yeah I agree. I think Bethesda underestimated the undertaking when they decided to branch out into online multiplayer but I guess they had to start somewhere.
---
The genre is expanding at a rapid pace so keeping up and coming from behind isn't easy.
---
There‚Äôs two things at work here. Melee tends to do slower, big hits. This naturally works very well against armor, as the bigger your hit, the less armor reduces it. 
---
The other massive one is melee gets 75% armor ignore from perks. Combine the two, and essentially, everyone might as well be naked vs that dude wielding a 600 damage super sledge. 
---
500 amor from t-51b? 125 after Incisor perk. 600 damage against 125 armor and 300 health? Yeah, it‚Äôs gonna crush your skull with 1 swing. 
---
Yes- happy to finally see a stash box in the bunker :)
---
Ps4
---
Me and my friend did this it's infinite just religious in and ull be fine
---
Only explosive weapon I have is a Western revolver. 
---
Mole miner origin confirmed
---
Pretty sure ive got the marine armor plans, id do like 500 caps
---
I am always hungry and thirsty there 
---
Thank you.  That's the feeling I was aiming for with it.  Just a nice, warm, and inviting place.
---
This is why I always use the Travel Agent card. People seem to discount it, but it adds up fast. Plus placing your camp in the center of the map and using it as a free fast travel point also saves you a ton of caps. 
---
Yeet
---
Still buggy though often enjoyable at times.
---
Yeah I had to move my base today and had issues with planting. Kept saying i couldnt even when they were green so i cant line them up like my ocd wants to
---
Does the nuke silo holotape show this timer?  I've only read it a couple times but I think that's what its supposed to tell us.
---
Have you ever thought this was intentional? That they are just there to terrorize and not reward?
---
They‚Äôre farming you. Don‚Äôt let them (unless you‚Äôre having fun, but sounds like you‚Äôre not)
---
There is a power armor station you can use to scrap in camden. Inside the roller coaster track where the raider power armor can spawn.
---
So only in the hundreds when compared to the thousands of every other weapon type, with the damage being closer to automatics, with the highest resistance meaning you're only roughly higher than 50% damage resist in terms of damage in PVE? That's not...really impressive, what with folks sitting comfortably in the 1,000 and up range while also boasting superior DPS and fire rate as well as armor piercing. But, I don't want a damage boost, just rather an emergency DPS boost that's incredibly inaccurate when fired in rapid succession. 
---
You mean it always had that? Oof. I aint worried about it then.
---
nyL0C666/XB1
---
When is the separate game mode feature coming? I thought that was going to be on this one? Been waiting patiently (maybe impatiently would be more accurate) for that! Is that what you mean by "survival mode" in the comments directly below here? (it's below now, not sure once my comment is posted lol) 
---
I just need the arms plans and wetsuit if you got that drop your screen name abe we can do this asap
---
it did until i read about being about being able to plant on top of campfires and other objects. now my farm is on my roof and i could careless. outta site, outta mind
---
LadyDevann whom you may see on here sometimes inspired me on todays stream to give FO76 another shot
---
I meant for crops.
---
Wish I was on pc so I could join them. 
---
thats funny because i never encountered them when i first started playing as a solo player. until i started playing with other people they would always run into them and i never noticed and thought it was a visual bug.
---
I walked from Charleston, trying to get to the top right corner of the map. I was kindly given a Nukahooch at the Overseer's Camp, and blacked out at Slocum Joe's. When I came to, I was at on top of a cliff overlooking Charleston Train Dtation.
---
I was royally pissed off.
---
I hardly ever found fully charged cores in suits, but I agree, they were mostly around 75% before the patch, and I've found more with 25% after the update. The patch notes said that there is more fusion cores in generators in the world now, though, so maybe this is the trade-off for that.
---
So, forgive me for being a dumbass, but there are now TWO cults in the game? I thought it was just the Mothman cult that was in West Virginia, and thus chalked up every occult thing I found so far to them. But I see I was wrong now?
---
So there are two cults, one worshipping Mothman and one worshipping the other creature? And this other creature, is it the same one we saw being worshipped in Fallout 4?
---
I just use walls and attach them downward as a second print. Usually works for me. Ide show you in pictures but i just got my house how i wanted it and remaxed my budget. You have to work your way down but it can work.

is this your first Fallout game or something? it is a known fact in Fallout lore that the "great war" was caused by a US vs China war. previous games have had Chinese soldiers that survived as ghouls (most as enemies, and who can blame them? trapped in a foreign country for hundreds of years, I'd be pissed too). it isn't racist in the terms of the game to have Chinese enemies, especially when the US government/military isn't exactly portrayed as "good" either.
---
I would pay atoms to never worry about hunger and thirst in this game. It's just an annoying chore.
---
Fuck, I‚Äôm an asshole, sorry. Your very courteous reply made me remember that the tooltip doesn‚Äôt specify the damage. I‚Äôve been playing since launch, the values are all in my head now. 
---
If you were already bored by December this probably isn‚Äôt the game for you. 
---
It's in c drive / Documents / My Games folder.
---
No I am :P
---
I havent seen any others, do I need to buy them from traders? I've only seen more treated ones
---
i had a feeling hat all recipes after the first would be randomized. this proves it. oh well, incentive to keep playing the quest lol.
---
Lot's of the bugs were fixed and there is a fun and interactive quest about a new Nuka-Cola drink, It's really fun and you get a Vault Tec University uniform. There will be new content coming out like ever week. I personally re downloaded it and im having a blast.
---
Why? I had done all of the quests and group events and hit 50 so my character was done progressing. I had done basically everything in the game. Is there not more content now?
---
Huh, TIL. can't believe I've never noticed it. Thanks! 
---
I don't know.  I haven't seen anything about stealth nerfs. 
---
Hahah I got that too, I don‚Äôt think the Brahmin like it much
---
Nope like the other guys said if you were already out of stuff to do by then...no don't bother till around may
---
I think only the bloodied melee bros are sitting up that high now since yesterday's patch and they're going to be at much lower health, probably 5%.  My bloodied revolver was doing 1k before that. I do like the idea of the emergency boost though, if it activated like nerd rage perhaps. I guess the problem lies in the pve/pvp balance too. 
---
Apparently I'm the only one who hasn't noticed a difference. I never have a problem keeping up with food and water, but I try to leave myself topped off all the time for the bonuses. I treat it like the old school idea of your car's gas tank being empty if it isn't half full.
---
I'd do what another poster suggested, find a way to stock up and make it last. I took Good With Salt recently because I wanted to craft some high quality food. It helps all around and I can make stacks of things that last a long time. Combining it with stuff like Green Thumb to get two of every harvested plant and Super Duper to get bonuses crafting and you'll make out alright. If you're ever starving just hit up Flatwoods for all the ingredients to make Appalachili, or set up a garden to farm sweet tato stew. Snaptails are the only extra you need for that (to make sugar) and they're available in abundance along the river south of the vault. 
---
Cool, I think I'll give it a go.
---
They can do this because you can leave the server. The power to engage is yours and yours alone.
---
Strict but fair.
---
I've got a wall all ready to go to display a few mounted animals. 
---
Dude your comments are at least reasonable,  have you read some of the responses I‚Äôve got to this post? lol . 
---
I do have most of the defensive mutations ,unstable,electrically , plague but if I‚Äôm in passive mode that should still not instigate a damage response from another player .
---
I‚Äôm talking about all the exploits that are being used to instigate unbelievable damage and there is absolutely no countering it in power armor that I have come up with if there is other than running away I would welcome the advise .
---
I don‚Äôt go around video taping my game play but maybe I should to  bring light to this broken ass pvp system .if you don‚Äôt want to participate there shouldn‚Äôt be rewards  or incentives  for  griefers as it is they generally win and we lose . And just to be clear I don‚Äôt instigate pvp ever I don‚Äôt hunt bounties and I never take over workshops . I‚Äôm all pve and my character is set up for that.
---
Yes sneak is still bugged . It's rather annoying.  It works properly more often after patch but still stops working pretty often as well.  
---
owning a workshop means you are automatically added to PVP. read the notice when you claim it. while they were definitely assholes, there is zero fault on them for taking your caps when you WERE flagged for pvp combat.
---
You could switch servers, there isn't going to be a CAMP there every time... Some like to build near a vendor or train station. Just think of it as another random encounter. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Just need to update your custom.ini file.
---
Some mods need updates/uninstalls as well though- better inventory was definitely broken, although I hear it‚Äôs been updated today 
---
Also in the old E3 footage lol
---
It would also be nice if the pieces shaped like trapezoids could be placed into an existing corner. Instead, you have to build a wall opposite where you want the trapezoidal piece, hang the roof, hang the trapezoid from the wall, and then fill in the sides adjacent to the trapezoid. As a consequence, two trapezoids are unable to be place adjacently to each other.
---
That very well could be. 
---
Except the part where I mentioned I literally never attacked them. 
---
I was at a workshop, my friend was at my camp and said some guy was invisible inside my camp. I fast traveled to my camp to see. The SECOND I load in the guy sprays me and I die in 1 shot.
---
I didn't have a bounty.
---
Ah, gotcha. I thought you were just realizing that it irradiated you. Sorry i jumped the gun. I should have read more closely. ;o)
---
Not working here either
---
Thanks a lot
---
I have always played game like this solo so it doesn't bother me too much. As for companions, they bug the hell out of me, but I can see why they are needed in the game.
---
you are flagged for pvp when someone takes your workshop. I was across the map at my camp, and none of them claimed my workshop.
---
Dumbass.
---
If anyone could answer my questions  It'd be awesome thank you for your time.
---
Np! 
---
I did the quest on an alt and noticed something interesting. On my main, I don't think there are any undiscovered locations left. My alt is level 15. 
---
It dumped me in the middle of the Savage Divide in a place I'd never been with that character. 
---
It‚Äôs Chinese. Do you not know simple lore from any fallout game?
---
They added brewing and distilling crafting and all the challenges are alcohol related
---
It‚Äôs all good! Thanks now I know
---
There are a TON of locations meant just to explore and read the terminals within them. Most of the lore within the game all comes from that. If you aren‚Äôt interested in that part of the game you are probably better suited for more of a looter shooter game.
---
I was gettimg 18 per assault rifle with the scrapper perk. 23 for miniguns 14 for combat shotguns. I did uranium fever with 4 ppl and everyone had over 1000 steel from one run
---
I know.. one day Todd will bless us all
---
I explored all of the marked locations too.
---
Downloaded the 17GB still not unbanned from the error code 4:8:2000 from a month ago I‚Äôve heard nothing about from anyone or Bethesda...
---
My floating water purifier is bugging me but I‚Äôm not concerned enough to try and move it. I agree with the razor grain too! 
---
I never knew what the exact number was, but i am glad it dropped to one. I need all the help I can get. LOL ;o)
---
...And Fallout 3 and Point Lookout DLC as well, the Ug-Qualtoth cult is canonical, the sacrifices and cult designs in the Mothman cult is inspired from Ug-Qualtoth cult in Fallout lore and not the other way around - hence way I think their cult have several gods, like many religions, and one chould choose which deity he prefers while aknowledging the existence of all other deities
---
Thanks for the warning man. Sorry it happened to you though that‚Äôs a bummer. Hopefully they‚Äôre able to find a fix for you soon
---
Holding for a little while if anyone wants to stop by
---
No TSE is not the meta. They got a huge balance change (nerf) and are no where near as powerful. They also added explosive resistances in the perk cards. 
---
Alright, you‚Äôve convinced me to go for another couple of runs...
---
That's where I woke up too. I ended up getting distracted by a bunch of unfinished minor objectives around the Mire and Cranberry Bog and still haven't made it back to Morgantown yet.
---
Just searched all over Tanagara and the only thing I found that might be a clue is that theres a chalkboard with an 8 and 6 written on it.
---
My Harper's Ferry runs now end by going to the Armory, grabbing all the Coolant Caps from the Air Condensers (30 free aluminum!) then heading just a little south to Red Rocket to break down scrap, check the PA station for a fusion core, kill whatever is there, then fast travel. 
---
Where on the map? I can't fast travel, but didn't know if it was walking distance for me
---
Just follow the quest line until you reach Morgantown, then do as you please you can find some Astronaut suits up north in the toxic valley, there is a lot to explore. If you're on PS4, i can help you around.
---
Vending machines should really be put in the whitesprings vendor hallway. Add free fast travel inside the building and you are set!
---
This is actually how subtitles should be handled when dealing with a language that is foreign to the character. The other alternative is giving a *transliteration* of the sounds, but not a *translation* of the speech (e.g. You would write 'Xie xie' not 'Thank you'). 
---
Chances are if you are specced for rifles and stealth, that it would take you several levels to get your special score right, and then several more to get the actual perk cards for the build. Then you might get all that done and decide you don't like it and want to go back, but you can't because you've changed your SPECIAL layout. 
---
The best advice I can give anyone for builds, because this happens to me all the time, is just use the planners as a guide and not necessarily a rulebook. As you are developing your character, you will find that you want to make subtle changes from the build that help the character feel more comfortable to you. Nukes and Dragons is my personal favorite, because you can set up the end build you want, and then swap all the cards out and see what other builds can work inside of that same SPECIAL set. For instance your power armor/heavy guns build would accommodate swapping out to the weight reduction and crafting perks, so you could benefit from both.
---
The only thing I would say is mandatory is maxing out the damage for ONE weapon type in your build. You can fill out a few other perks for a back up weapon if you want, but you will never see the damage numbers you're looking for if you have 30% in each weapon class. Also, critical will play a big part in that damage, and armor penetration is really helpful for Assaultrons. They have INSANE armor values. That's why a level 24 of those seems so much harder than a scorchbeast or even a deathclaw at level 50-60.
---
And no pvp inside
---
It could still cost the teleport fee you know. 
---
On the road next to Lady Janet‚Äôs Soft Serve
---
I‚Äôm coming!
---
I would suggest that you don't, it might spoil the experience for you. Just run around and shoot and collect stuff. Enjoy the mystery and the unknown. Be the vault dweller going out into the waste to rebuild with their own vision in mind.
---
It‚Äôs crazy how much downvotes these comments get, people are so narrow minded... smh!!! Bethesda can do no wrong in their eyesüòÇ
---
Man I drank my Nuka shine. Next thing I head was ‚Äúah you‚Äôre awake‚Äù
---
TSE? and ok..but my build does not call for explosive resistance? My big issue is being over weight all the time due to wanting to use a few rifles, I feel like I have to use the excavator set or I can't move.
---
I play by myself 90% of the time doing the quests and it's fun. i encounter other players often but usually they just wave and go about their buisness. there's the occasional guy wanting to trade, the friendly CAMP owner who invites me to rest in their base, and of course the asshole who tries to kill you for shits and giggles (i have also bet some who shoot me once with the "slap damage", basically asking me to fight. i throw the "no" emote and they leave). but for the most part I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with others.
---
Still have the Lemonade Stand going at the moment if anyone still needs recipes.
---
Darmok, and Jalad... on the ocean.
---
Well that‚Äôs good way also! Would be like grand exchange in runescape. I‚Äôm not sure did I write it there but you could like tp freely to the sellers camp to check things out also.
---
Ohhh it won‚Äôt let me join, says you‚Äôre offline :(
---
30 minutes. 
---
Not the guy you're replying to, but I can give you the wetsuit plans for 800 right now. I have the marine torso and legs, but not the arms, unfortunately.
---
I'm in the game right now, if you want the wetsuit: add me, my PSN is miskhak, join my world, I'm at Watoga right now.
---
I haven‚Äôt tested unstable isotope or welded rebar, but I promise you, if a wanted player attacks you, and Electrically Charged triggers and hits them, it won‚Äôt matter if you have Pacifist on, you‚Äôll become in PVP with them and they can do full damage. 
---
I‚Äôd call it a bug, but it is what it is, for now. And I don‚Äôt disagree about PVP balance here. Just trying to let you know what you can do to limit the impact, right now.
---
It‚Äôs not about doing absurd amounts of damage; that doesn‚Äôt break slap damage limits. It‚Äôs about getting you in full PVP with them so they can do normal damage. And your reactive mutations will allow that to happen. 
---
I‚Äôve done extensive testing of slap damage itself, I‚Äôve never been able to overcome it (and I‚Äôve pushed between 10 and 18 thousand damage with sneak headshots). 
---
Ok, it ain‚Äôt that buggy if you are on PC and you get to micro-manage everything from your loadout, your armor and weapon condition, and...well everything.  
---
It all degrades.  
---
Yes, I enjoy this game.
---
And if you are on Xbox one, I can help you. I love helping newbies. Not to mention, it gives me more time to look for scrap. Just let me know. My GT is BillyZ1962
---
Look me up anytime. ;o)
---
Preach 
---
How do you make ultracite ammo?
---
Good to know! I won't attempt it.
---
This would actually be pretty neat. A companion app similar to the one Destiny had. You could view your stash and manage your inventory, check out your status in pip-boy, study bits of lore, and view current challenges. 
---
Oh, you want to chat recruit? Well I heard that Jenny May WAS EATEN BY COMMUNISTS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T FINISH YOUR TRAINING IN A TIMELY MANNER
---
TSE is 2shot explosive. I'm saying you can have explosive resistance now which further combats the nerf they got. Then you throw dense on your chest and explosive damage is almost nothing. Sound like you need some inventory management. I run around with 4-5 rifles all the time and haven't used power armor for a long long time unless I go into nuke zones. 
---
I‚Äôve checked a couple times now and he isn‚Äôt carrying it?
---
Maybe I just take my time more. I like to read the terminals and reflect on them as I explore the locations. Sounds kinda lame but it extends the game and makes it more fun.
---
Worked for me over encumbered. I‚Äôm basically permanently over encumbered because I must be terrible at inventory management. 
---
OMG this. I collect low level legendaries for alts, themed alts, or friends
---
I actually prefer to play alone. And miss the solice that could be achieved in the previous games. However I do play with some friends a lot and it can be very intertaining. 
---
 There are some days I wish I could play by myself. And not have to hear some young kid ask me to fix his crap! While I making my daily run through the vendors. 
---
 I hate to say it. Sometimes this game can almost mimic real life. I have to go to work and do team stuff, and then deal with annoying people. Till I can get home and relax after a long day of looting and questing!ü§î
---
Would it be connected to the same switch? 
---
I've heard that Graham shares the same cap pool for special vendors as well, but I don't know for sure. 
---
Good explanation of how it works. 
---
Is it just the lemonade and hard lemonade recipe, or does he have more?
---
That's fair. I mean I read all the terminals and stuff, I just played a shit tonne. 
---
There is also an armor workbench on the other side of the divider by the PA station
---
yeah i know thats why its dumb.. if anything they shouldve just made the area un-nukable or something for a little bit. but thats only if that hypothesis is correct. tbh probably just a screw-up on their part like always. 
---
Yeah idk why just message me and I‚Äôll invite
---
Please atleast be minimum specs when you try to play a game, they made the game for certain systems, and you're trying to play under what they determined is the minimum neccessary to run it... Makes it harder for support to pinpoint the issue too
---
Still there?
---
So this is just speculation of course but wondering if this Vault was meant to have an experiment involving athletes or something- I took a look around the site, and there‚Äôs a trailer nearby containing some kickballs and a power cycle, and if you follow the road away from the Vault door, there‚Äôs a volleyball net set up just outside the Vault...
---
Just the two that I know of. Me and u/UND00MED only got Lemonade and Hard Lemonade also.
---
Yep, join off GT
---
Right. You could have a machine at your camp that is tied to the same inventory as your machine in whitesprings.  If someone is using it in one place it can just say it's "busy". 
---
Whitesprings would also be a great place to meet up and go adventuring. Or just a great place to trade!
---
Literally everyone since they started playing Fallout 4, yes.
---
When I first encountered the keypad, I assumed the code would have been the episode number of "Darmok", but the keypad didn't work.  I'll have to stop by and try it again.
---
Agreed. Loot tables are still shit, just killed 2 ** mire lurk Kings and no legendaries....
---
That was your quest?  Hmmm.  Well for mine I needed to drink the drink, then wait for the quest to update to tell me what to do next.. didn't get that one yet though so not sure.
---
I just want to get rid of my addiction, can‚Äôt find the the cure anywhere! I don‚Äôt have the plan either if there is one!
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure either so I didn‚Äôt mention it for that sake. Hopefully someone else may chime in to verify.
---
Came here to look into the faster hunger and thirst meters. If anyone drank and ate this much irl they would be morbidly obese and their kidneys would shut down from hyponatremia. Hopefully they can fix it soonish
---
In queue
---
Lets go a little lower than 800
---
good idea
---
I was wondering about that as well. It had been awhile since I played so I wondered if I'd just forgotten, but it did seem to drain pretty quickly.
---
Nothing epic about it. Just a simple statement of fact. You‚Äôre crying because you don‚Äôt understand how the game works. Good job. 
---
Right now it‚Äôs a bit unstable, but earlier in the week it was amazing, and you can probably expect it to be back there soon
---
Cause its fun! /s
---
No, but in all seriousness, anyone actually enjoys this micromanagement of thirst and hunger? Isn't rad and health not enough?
---
Are you trying to troll up some sjw bullshit?
---
Sounds like you chose the perks you didn't want to use 125 times. Just keep grinding buddy. Hopefully you get lucky in a perk pack at 130. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You could always start a new character as well. 
---
Also it will be a while b4 I can get on
---
Didn't realise that my post garnered so much attention.
---
I do try however - cue the smallest violin in the world - I learned English out of need and rather late in life therefore most of my formation on the subject is... rather informal.
---
In my defence my Basque and Spanish are considerably better *wink wink*
---
Awesome! Thx for posting !
---
I have the cards need to adjust the points, guess I wasn‚Äôt clear. 
---
Good to know I‚Äôm in great company with these feelings!
---
just exit and then go back to the mirror and it will show up again without the cost of raw materials
---
Not sure what you mean, the mirror is almost fully submerged in the wall, can't get it out by normal means. 
---
I hear ya. I had some tool that was calling in my base and provoked a wanted level. It‚Äôs definitely not perfect and I hope those people that pull that crap move on to something else. 
---
Same issue allowed both. Foundations, like crops, can only be placed in the ground.  Campfires were considered dirt for whatever reason, and this allowed the stacking of foundations as well as planting crops on the campfire.

I always use a terminal because it doesn't have to be wired directly to the door, just in the same circuit. Uncertain about how to wire like a floor switch, but I've seen them in builds.
---
Yup I'm lvl 290 and have godly gear but I don't like pvp in this game so I don't take workshops it's just how it is
---
Yep. There‚Äôs just one thing that I noticed when I played runescape back in the day. Grand exchange ate up most of the dynamics of the map like player wise. Most of players would just stay there  all the time and sell them selves as ‚Äúgirl friends‚Äù lol. Don‚Äôt get me wrong this white spring method would be also fuckin awesome but it could eat up possible ‚Äúculture‚Äù that could form to around the trading. 
---
Maybe. Do you have your launcher set to allow background downloads? You could have had most of the patch downloaded, but there was stuff still running in the background.
---
There‚Äôs a guy here trying to attack me so be careful 
---
Works full. - queued to join
---
That in effect makes them a power levelers dream.
---
Time gating them would be better.
---
Well you used a bug to build your house, so it only makes sense that items you placed on it could bug also. Sorry for your loss but one piece of decoration being unusable is not a big deal. I've had way worse things happen while building and stuff eating my budget. 
---
Yes I would miss them.
---
I consider it a fallout tradition for them to be in every game.
---
how do I not know how the game works?
---
They abused the lack of balance to one shot me over and over again.
---
Well shit the Nords might invade Fallout
---
I am fairly certain that it was only activated in the most recent patch.
---
If you manage to find the appropriate code well, I don't mind my coffee with a spoonful of spoilers :P
---
Not just steel. Laser rifles give double the plastic (these have always been my secret plastic source- go kill a bunch of super mutants, scrap 20 laser rifles, get 120 plastic... now it‚Äôs going to be like 200)
---
Gamma guns give like 11 steel&amp;plastic
---
It's very disappointing that it doesn't work in CAMP, arguably the most important place where you'd want to change where you land. Who cares about temporary workshops?
---
Side question, why do so many people on this sub feel the need to preface their posts by telling people they played in the beta, or leveled up to 100+ ? 
---
It would be too easy :/ just go to fissure sights and light them up
---
I think the flux values were listed
---
Honestly with the dlc. They should have gave the basic nukashine and one of, non tradeable drink let‚Äôs us roll around 3-5 special points. 
---
went there today to find the paint and there was already open xd
---
Yeah I normally wave at people and then ask how they are going. Sometimes have a bit of a chat. 
---
Have met quite a few people like this, have joined a guild, and met a cool neighbour who's camp is right next to mine. 
---
Haven‚Äôt found the legendary vendor or a single sheepsquatch yet, I‚Äôm guessing they release later this month too?
---
Guessing you played minecraft lmao üòÇüòÇ
---
Oh that's not that bad then. Just sounds like a grind fest to 130 then. Make sure you choose which specials to shift carefully. I have to move about 10 points to fix up my first character into a full stealth build. It started as a jack of all trades/ survival class that I decided needed to be a more focused build to be viable end game.
---
Can I get a F please? 
---
It‚Äôs in your my documents/games/FO76 folder, not in the game install folder
---
Been trying to get his daily. Did the quest yesterday do I just keep visiting the tattoo parlor till it procs?
---
I think graham shares the same pool as responders vendors.
---
I've got an extra copy I'll let go for a cool 500c
---
They were. Everything OP listed was in the notes.
---
There is hope for this game. Omggggg yesssss
---
Level 10 monsters will drop level 10 legendaries
---
i spawned in a wacky tree house lol, pretty neat! never saw it
---
It's not griefing if it's a game mechanic 
---
Nah hover lol
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with not listing every new thing in the world‚Äîlike Brahmin milking, brighter flora, new random encounters etc. It helps add surprise and a feeling that the world is evolving. 
---
The flux value change was definitely in the patch notes, not in love with that but it was there. It was a long list. 
---
I‚Äôd agree that nerfs or negative value changes should be listed in patch notes, with explanations. 
---
Instructions unclear. I shot a workshop on the back but failed to claim a PvP initiate.
---
You‚Äôre a crying little fucktard welcome to my block list. 
---
I loved the Nuka-Cola lamp until I noticed it has a Nuka-Cherry cap...
---
Okay cool. And that's fine. I'm cool with that. I was just getting frustrated because I was wondering why nothing was starting to turn vintage. But I guess that doesn't make sense.
---
Honestly I love survival aspects like this. But food is too abundant, same with water. So the game might as well not even have this. Feels like a chore at times. Especially when food spoils in an hour.
---
The game is fine. Yes there are some issues. Some vary from player to player. But it‚Äôs better than launch. 
---
Pvp needs a tweak or 3, the player driven market is overpriced and over saturated. 
---
I‚Äôd get it. You‚Äôll likely make a friend or two and have some laughs. 
---
It was Windows 7. Which they supposedly said was supported.
---
It's not nearly as buggy as it was at launch. My gripe is they took too long to implement and some of the nerfs/buffs effected my build. It's almost worth starting another PvP character.
---
I too was hesitant about the weapon/armor condition and other survival mechanics, but past level 20 they are pretty manageable. Just make sure to do the first few quest lines to get all of the necessary plans.
---
Maybe you should, oh, play with other actual people?  
---
Yes, it does. A LOT.
---
Mine is 250. It's a liiiittle bit frustrating.

---
Use search in the fo76 sub. 
---
If you buy the poster in the atom shop to start the mission where can you find it to post it?
---
There are bugs, but I personally haven‚Äôt had any problem with huge bugs that make it unplayable. I enjoyed fallout 4 and at first I wasn‚Äôt sure about 76, but over time i‚Äôve come to love it. My only problem has been with the quests since they only have a few quest lines to follow, but since they just added a new one I do genuinely think it‚Äôs getting better and worth it. 
---
This is why I can‚Äôt get into the game. I think it would only be fun if I could find someone to play with. To me what makes F04 so fantastic was the companions. No NPCS, companions or otherwise, feels very lonely and empty.
---
Kept checking to see if I got parasites or something as I kept having to eat and drink non stop now.  First time since I started playing I ran out of food traveling.
---
The valley just north is good. The electrical tower has a random spawn point. You‚Äôll be a full sprint from the station. 
---
I let him do nothing. But one (ingame) night, i was freaking out. The guy goes to sleep and there's that green light comming out of him.
---
Took me a long time to understand he had picked a rad gun somewhere.
---
I've heard people have been trying to find it since the beta, according to another reddit post, it can be found in random events in the Myre, aka the darkest region on the map.
---
Plz do I'm not the only one wtf
---
Did you give him a Nukashine?
---
The campfire trick was the secret to building massive fortresses of indestructible foundations, and in order to eliminate that exploit it screwed the camp fire planter exploit as well.
---
OK... but what about placing lone items like say making a pool table with rack &amp; all? there's only so much you can display if it's just inside racks :\... I was starting to collect junk items but now I'm getting a bit disheartened.
---
Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life.
---
You forget Patch 5 already?
---
This is totally off subject but don't feel bad guys I'm level 82 and I've never seen a sloth rarely pick up 2 * legendary items
---
Agreed! There should be a small reward for completing all dailies or weeklies besides atoms. Maybe.... More atoms? 
---
This would be awesome. I‚Äôm so excited to have vending machines. I‚Äôll finally be able to start making caps and buying the plans I want.
---
That didnt list everything lol, they had already said decorating with stash stuff
---
Not that high of a level yet. I probably wouldn‚Äôt last long there. Definitely seen people wearing it though 
---
On PS4 I don‚Äôt believe I can run the game at all unless I‚Äôm on the most current version. 
---
Either way it‚Äôs happened to me and another person I play with. I‚Äôve even updated the original post with a pic of someone else‚Äôs camp in a spot it told my buddy was illegal, and I‚Äôve been able to replace my camp in my original spot.
---
If it‚Äôs working like intended why do I get to drop my camp and build in illegal spots without a heads up? Why will it stay there on multiple logins? Why do other folks get to build there?
---
IDK what it is, but somethings not right. 
---
It‚Äôd be super helpful if BGS let us know what the claimed areas were for reference. 
---
Bethesda really missed an inside joke by not having a burnt couch somewhere during this quest line. 
---
Couch burning, for reasons I have yet to understand, was a time honored tradition among WVU (the real life university VTU is based on) partiers. 
---
Not just one, but a bunch of them. 
---
I had this happen at least 4 times last night. All syringers. One was a 3 star enemy :(
---
Just take your time finding it, There is another cool suit that can probably substitute it, the astronaut suit which can be found in the north region of the toxic valley.
---
I think you have to interact with him, it didn't activate immediately, but when I did it once or twice it worked.
---
Found a Bobby pin on the ground and got stoked for a second... I am a man.
---
Thank gosh for radios!
---
Now I just pray we get a version of the Jukebox that plays jazz or swing or something. It makes no sense that the "life of every party" plays a single holotape with a tiny variety of classical tunes.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love classical music, but my swingin' diner/motel/trading outpost needs some 50's rock'n'roll or some proper swing or... Something. I'm attracting the wrong crowd! I want the cool cats and whatnot. All I'm getting is weird old guys in lab coats who are offering copious amounts of chems in exchange for my Daddy-O and beer.
---
If we get some rockin', swingin' jukeboxes, I'll be a happy man.
---
Also, radios take a very long time to actually play anything ~5 minutes of silence before they start making music.
---
Blocking someone on Reddit lmao 
---
I don‚Äôt have an issue with PvP at workshops, but it needs to be limited to the workshop zone. That way if a player doesn‚Äôt want to engage they can just walk away or not travel to defend it, effectively surrendering the workshop. 
---
If im not mistaken, theres already a terminal (advanced switches plan) you can use in your CAMP to control light colors and switches etc. 
---
Isnt this already owner restricted access? Might be wrong obviously. 
---
Apparently u have to hit him without killing him to get him to insult
---
+ karma thank you for the insight !! I defer to your knowledge and that sounds like a reasonable answer to getting passed the slap damage . Its also another example of this broken pvp mechanic that they can exploit that .
---
Thanks again .
---
I really miss that glitch. Being able to put all your cores in the PA chassis and have it be included in the flat 10 pounds. 
---
I still try every now and then but it was officially patched in like December I think. 
---
Dog food and water practically rain from the sky, makes the mechanic a meaningless chore.
---
I don't cook shite, I don't even  pick up meat from corpses because it's heavy and clogs up the aid screen. 
---
yea, I hope they mean you can decorate the entire camp with items from your stash free placement. Such a huge list of items I've collected/still want to collect for that purpose.
---
Yeah I am actually off the mind that you should be able to stack foundations too, but I guess that's another game breaker.
---
And I'd be fine if they just took out being able to destroy camps. It serves no good purpose except to harass other players. 
---
yeah i know, that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm a bit confused. Probably another ‚Äûfeature‚Äú of their latest Patch.
---
Well if anything remember we are playing a Bethesda game and bugs are a feature.
---
The same happened to TESO, it had a rocky launch and now it is one of the best MMORPGs out there. 
---
I missed the flux value change in the notes. 
---
Show me where the 3 other things are listed. 
---
The new speakeasy Place to me atleast. IS THE PERFECT location.
---
Minimum integer
---
Same, no Dailies appeared yesterday or so far today
---
Try google
---
Shame they couldn't fix the entire "operation could not be complete" bullshit so you literally can't install mods or creation club content that you've paid for. How glorious paying for content you can't access.
---
I am continually surprised by Bethesda's decisions.  
---
Still no brightness slider?  
---
Having to mash space bar for a few minutes making enough boiled water is still annoying.  
---
Why, oh why, did you take out item preview during transactions?  What was the reasoning behind that?  
---
Also, why do users have to look up solutions on forums to fix all the bad UI decisions Bethesda forces on us?  
---
My Fallout76Custom.ini file is getting quite massive.
---
Yeah, its weird. there was some of that in Fallout 4, but in Fo76, its much worse AND the water thing. They clearly drew a lot more water and then covered it with land later because a lot of my camps keep getting an error saying I can't build on water and I'm a good 10-20 feet away
---
Whoa, you're willing to pay 2000 for both, I'm offering you the rarer of the two plans for less than half, and now you start haggling? :-) 
---
But okay, I can offer them for less, I have lots of other plans you might need as well. So, still: you can have the plans right now, or you can wait until tomorrow night, your choice. I'm not doing reservations, though, so if someone else asks me for them, they're gone.
