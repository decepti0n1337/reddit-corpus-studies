Yeah, I'm sure there's always someone, but they're an outlier. That'd suck though. Speed is the only "hack" to slap damage.

---
I've seen this happen twice with one happening while I was in the loot menu. The mole miner had a key on him. 
---

---
What I did notice is that this happens when another player shows up and the enemies respawn, in the case with the mile miner i managed to kill the one with the key again and loot it along with the missle launcher he had

Add /u/6a6566663437 to this list as well, who hopped on a troll account to send hate PMs lmfao
---
How did this get upvoted so high? This sort of post normally would have been downvoted into the ground.
---
Of course people are starting to hoard now because it means more legendaries for when the vendor comes around.
---
The people who benefit the most from the legendary vendor are people who use mules. Who do you think are the ones madly farming and hoarding their legendaries?
---
That looks great! I guess I know what I'm doing when I get off work tonight!
---
&gt;Lol, you are such a fucking dumbass. No one thinks it's real, 
---
Oh the irony from someone who cant even read all the comments in this very thread who prove him wrong. Pathetic.
---
It should. I‚Äôve used automatic rifles and have gotten the effects
---
Cause they enjoy being an asshole and it's fun for them.  
---
Now I've played games where the point is to be an asshole like TTT or jailbreak and it's fun as long as everyone is in on it
---
Rules of the game. This is a feature. It's scummy to drop a nuke specifically to kill and loot others bags, but if I see a bag of junk I'm taking it. Well I'm taking the plastic and nuclear material anyway.  Theres only 1 real consequence for death in this game and it's dropping your junk. People seem to forget that. 
---
Get naked. Hit some one with a rolling pin or board. Go to white springs and hog the vendor. Take your health down to almost nothing by jumping off ledges. Just make killing you a very easy enticing thing to do. 
---
Haha I found a dead ‚ÄúBrahmin‚Äù on the giant bridge above Flatwoods. It was labeled Brahmin, it‚Äôs inventory was a brahmin‚Äôs inventory, but the model was a Radstag, and searching it with Butcher‚Äôs Bounty gave me Radstag meat.
---
It just works! 
---
Ah ok thanks a bunch!
---
Gmorristwn on Xbox. Hit me up anytime!

I figure, it'll grow back.  If they notice all they'll notice is that the stuff they expected to be there isn't there.  
---
When I sometimes manage to load into the middle of other people's locked camps, I really like leaving them a paper bag full of fertilizer right in the middle of their locked building.  Maybe if I'm bored enough one day I'll wait around in Chameleon armor long enough for them to come find it and see what they say.  The stars haven't quite aligned that well, but I have left a number of sacks full of fertilizer for a few people now.  
---
In my mind they arrive and say, "oh wow, someone left something in here for me?" ....  "Wait a second, how did they get in?  I closed the locked door didn't I?"  ... "I wonder what they left me?"   ....  "WTF?"
---
Now, if only I could light that paperbag on fire.  That would be perfect.
---
I usually have lots of junk on me because something about mindlessly salvaging junk soothes me. Accordingly, I usually fix other players turrets and stuff because the wasteland isn't going to rebuild itself. üëç
---
Always exit pa. I won't pop off a bounty in pa cuz I don't Wana do any unnecessary damage to the armor just because they stuck a bobby pin where they shouldn't have. 
---
&gt; while having even more issues than it's predecessors 
---
This is the part I strongly disagree with.  Fo3, 4 and Skyrim had *LOTS* of problems on launch, and it was only months later that they were as "issue-free" as you imply.

I've been hoarding atoms for one of these two skins ever since you first posted them! Thanks for sharing them with us. Here's hoping they actually release them some day!
---
Id take one :) if ur still willing 
---
Ah, thank you. So absolutely nothing I'm interested except for the free nixie clock. Great.
---
Your posts in this thread are at -3 to -5.  You have an odd definition of "upvoted".
---
I wasn't going to watch it, but then you said this:  " (Be warned - his language is terrible!) ".
---
&gt;When a game has a secret ending for a full-clear, it still requires actually beating the game.
---
Oh look another one! Do you need glasses kiddo?

Looks amazing, going to be using this for sure, thanks!

Dude - I'm a 51 year old man with 4 kids, went to school for Philosophy (dropped out), my dad was a Lutheran minister (died last year).  A lot of what you writes resonates with me -- I wanted to do music, went the programming route, and have been a programmer for 25 years doing some cool things (including voicing Captain America on the old website).   This year has been stressful both in terms of my parents both dying (less than a year from each other) and of course, money.  I've been working on a lot of left-brain stuff, miss the right-brain exercises (and music) and have to worry about paying the mortgage.  For the time I'm on F76 it makes more sense -- just scrounge, just live, as you said.  Very black and white as opposed to the grey of 'I'll pay this bill and we have more time with this bill.".  Also trying to homeschool kids (3 under 7) while the oldest (18) is preparing for college. I get you man.  Don't know if you're a PS4 guy or not but look up grimmwerks on Wed and Fridays. Would be proud to explore Appalachia with you -- and honestly, even though my wife bought me a mic and headphones -- I've still avoided others.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Oh, and I appreciate all the shit you've got to wade through for your clients.  It's honestly brought another side to the 'lawyers are terrible' you always here about.  Thank you for being human. It's a rough ride though.
---
I would prefer a system where you could type in what you are looking for in a teammate first, then match up based on those interests. Perhaps a swipe left/right...oh wait, what are we talking about again? :P
---
All glory to our new insect overlords!
---
Of course it doesnt sound like something Bethesda would do, but it certainly didnt stop the diehard denialists of this sub from kicking and screaming while being brought back to reality. 
---
Was this the case for everything last week, too? Cause I might have bought some more stuff if I knew that.
---
I'm the same way.  I scavenge for ammo ingredients and junk to bulk for caps a lot so I always have some spare stuff on me.  Exactly,  the whole point of Vault 76 was to rebuild the nation after the war.  
---
Artifical scarcity is a common sales tactic, both in games and real life.  Guild Wars 2 often puts items on the gem store for a limited time.   Same thing when a store says "limit 2 per customer" on a sale.  
---
And of course, obviously,  there was nothing.
---
One needed only to look at the data mined info to confirm it but spending all day just to confirm theres nothing to the denialists of this sub is good enough for me. 
---
Pathetic enough to lose with 4. Last thing they need is more negative publicity.
---
In the Atom Shop? lololol, go to the menu for that shit.
---
Hmm. Just checked, my alt still could make them. I was sure they'd remove it.

Guess it's ok then. ign monokoi - come by soon and I'll gift you one.

You need help.  Karen, our psychologist, will help you with your...Karen, wtf are you doing with all those bears?

Cute cherry picking. Still at a net positive! Nice try kiddo
---
I've never spawned inside of a locked camp and I try to keep my locked area small, just large enough for a fusion generator, my decontamination arch, and a small water purifier so I always have some if I need it.  I've had people leave me ammo and aid items after they visit which is always a nice surprise to come back to.
---
All men must follow moth like a moth to a flame....we are mothmen whi live for mothman
---
Thanks for the info.
---
There's a junk pile right by the Top of the World right across the road to the train station
---
South of Windigo caves there is a spot with lead deposit right by a cliff with a nice view to the east towards Berkeley 
---
There's a flower on the map slightly southeast of the Pleasant Valley station. If you go there and poke around, you should find two lakes.
---
One will have three Brahmin living in it, and slightly to the south, there is another lake with an acid node in the middle. I used to live on the acid node, and I'd often load in to find neighbors living on the Brahmin pond.
---
You apparently also have an odd definition of positive.
---
You also apparently want to give people lots and lots of other posts to vote down.
---
damn them for  having a good time!
---
This is what got me thinking exactly. 
---
Cry more :) still positive btw 
---
Came here to say this. A sale on many low-selling items, combined "removing" them from the market, is often a microtransaction strategy to drain in-game currency before a high-cost/high-interest item gets released. The new item has a short (1-day) availability, a high cost, and because you've used your currency on the recent sale, a high likelihood to be available only with real cash.
---
Bowie knife with 40%swing speed.
---
Lol why would Bethesda do anything? Death is part of game who gives a shit if it's a streamer. Maybe their viewers actually got a good show out of that, seeing them four get their asses kicked out of nowhere
---
&gt;I hear these stories all the time, but have yet to encounter anyone grief me in such a way.
---
In a couple hundred hours it's only happened to me once, and it was fucking hilarious. I was shopping in the bunker when I hear a handy blade and start taking damage. I backed out thinking I might have accidentally aggro'd a robot, but it was a level 370 something (wearing the creepy clown mask of course) hacking away at me. 
---
I tried to ignore him and finish shopping, but the stagger klept pushing me out of range. I gave him the confused emote while slowly backing away (towards an assaultron), and then jumped out of the way and watched him him the lovely lady. Next thing you know he's got 10 angry robots on his ass and he died before he could get to the exit of the bunker. 
---
I grabbed his bag of junk and logged off.
---
Near the flower on the map up near top of the world.
---
Great place, ample amount of water for purifiers and fairly quiet when it comes to enemies 
---
I'm not any better. My fiance gave up on fallout so I have his account. The limit of characters are maxed and each have more than 1.3k plus the 800 in the stash. 
---
That's adorable &lt;3
---
I bet they talked about it and just said, fuck it, too much bother we won't give support for in game items, saves on staffing.
---
I have been thinking about this when I saw a fissure site close if nuked a few months ago. but didn't think bethesda would do something like this I Would like to help people by achieving this.
---
Fallout 76 can become a classic if handled wisely.
---
I honestly believe the suggestion ManyATrueNerd gave you about a campaign (even a short one) prior to the scorched plague is all the game needs to turn the hate the game has suffered into admiration
---
If you search online "resource node map fo76" it shows a map of all the resource nodes 
---
Its already been disproved. Theres nothing hidden lol
---
It's a miniature replica of the Doomsday Clock.

Sorry, this isn't real, and the story is still bad.
---
I am in.  Level 190+ Bloodied Sledger with hundreds of queens under my belt with my team.  I stream on Twitch as MinnesotaMenace and even if it doesn't do anything, it sounds like a fun time!  
---
Just know that pacifists in groups may not shoot you because it opens the whole group up to PvP.  If I'm by myself I'll help you clear it.  One of the groups I play with tends to carry lots of valuable junk (they like to sell stuff to people and trade) so they frown on having a group member open them up to PvP retaliation.   So, if I'm by myself, I'll even bring out ol' Bessie to do it.  Not a lot of people get to see ol' Bessie.   She's a Two-Shot BPR with extra aim damage.  That sneaking headshot will be nice and clean.   She may not be special to most, but she's special to me and that's good enough.  ;p
---
So if people don't take you up on your invite to end your wanted status, they may have other reasons as well.   There are some people going around asking people to take their wanted status and then taking advantage of the PvP.
---
Pacifist only prevents you from damaging them, you are still fair game
---
1) Approximately 1/2 way between Cliffwatch and 98 NAR Regional, top of the trail, south side, there is a lead deposit next to the cliff overlooking the western view.  Don't camp there. MINE. ;) (there are firecracker berries on the trail leading up, usually gives a nice warning if baddies come up the hill)
---
2) There is another lead deposit in a build-able area roughly due north of the Whitesprings Golf Club, up on the hill, about 50 yards past the fence line. Usually outside blast zone...
---
Probably some build-able sites with copper and other stuff in between, but there are set enemy spawns that will likely complicate matters.
---
Coincidentally, site 1 is at the top of the "easy" route up the ridge from the forest side, although there is a fissure below cliffwatch that occasionally becomes active. Bravo attacks are rare, but often you will see one flying around below you... 
---
  
---
Good to know. You have Adrenal Reaction? Ever since the patch 6 fuck up I wanna have extra just Incase. On ps4 as well Sleepz2184
---
I don‚Äôt think that you should be punished for being in pacifist mode because there are people that just go around killing people for caps especially higher levels 
---
They actually are about the same from a dps standpoint. TSE has a huge accuracy debuff though
---
Hmm...it seems there's a sudden mass of positive votes right before you post, that then gets overwhelmed by downvotes.
---
You're not creating sockpuppet accounts to upvote your own posts, are you?  'cause that would be very, very sad.
---
If you had someone join your team, then why didn't you just disconnect and rejoin through them?

Thought so. Reminds me of the classic overwatch seasonal event items

Neat, good to know, will have to start looking around for it

Laughter dissolves the power of tragedy. I‚Äôd recommend finding solace in reading some of Kierkegaard‚Äôs pseudonymous works. Philosophical gold and he‚Äôs probably the best writer on anxiety we‚Äôve got. Best of luck to you in the wastelands: virtual and real. 
---
Ahhh i love a happy ending! W.springs can mess you up no matter what level you are! Normally get baiters, poachers and griefers in nuke zones. Grabbing everyones bags being general dicks. Only time i will agree with griefing is with the w.springs campers. Putting your camp next to the windows is a real dick move. Like, fair enough have your camp there, but take off turrets!
---
Any chance the Blackbird power armor paint will have another week in the store?
---
I've played since release and somehow missed it.  Only found out it exists from reddit.  Would totally gobble that one up
---
Ah a fellow hoarder, it feels nice having a bunch of stuff doesn't it? So many things that you could craft but don't because you want to save resources.
---
Yes it's all a conspiracy, this sub cant possibly find the delusionists stupid. Thatd be absurd. Try harder kiddo
---
Oh, good to know. I'm so out of the loop on PvP dynamics I had no idea. That whole aspect of the game is just very unappealing to me. I get that when roleplaying some people want to be raiders or whatever, it's just never been my style.
---
I used to park my CAMP next to the Brahmin lake until I had to flip served one too many times ‚Äòcause someone else had the same idea.
---
will do! 
---
Yeah, I scrap often. I also invested most of my skill points into everything being lighter, I usally go for weight reduction before other upgrades.
---
Hey man really respect the hard work. Unfortunately it doesn't count as you completing the experiment so the mystery is still out there.
---
That said i assume you are correct that nothing happens.
---
You never really know though, for all we know aliens invade.
---
Norespawns, Final Render, and BADCompanySarge are the ones I watch the most.
---
I'll drop all that kind of stuff if people are actually there.  I just don't want to risk having good stuff evaporate if they log off without coming back.   I have spawned inside of locked buildings.  It is my favorite way of B&amp;E in the game.   
---
Now on the flip side, I'll wander by people's camps and if they are around I'll try to see if there is anything they want... their favorite kind of ammo, maybe some materials I happen to have on me, or these extra nuka colas I'm always picking up.   I just can't bring myself to drop any of this stuff on the hope that they might stumble across it.
---
So life's confusing that way.   The guy that just took all your food, emptied all your unlocked collectors, is also the same guy that repaired all the broken things he could find (man I really wish I could just repair their camp at the camp station like back at mine,) and he left you some goodies in a bag if you were around to take them.  Maybe even some plans you haven't found yet, if I happen to have some on me (50/50 on that one).    I figure life's confusing so the mutated Easter Santa Troll thingy leaving presets and taking stuff that isn't nailed down is a good fit for the wilds of this area...  ;)
---
Yes I do you on rn? 
---
Saw him fairly close to the border of Ash Heap and the Savage Divide, a bit west down the mountain from where the Morningside Bed and Breakfast.  Saw his brahmin first, and then followed the brahmin running to catch up to him.  Eventually a scorchbeast came out of nowhere and started pestering him from above.  
---
Nice fellow.
---
It feels like safety 
---
\#7 is asking for abuse
---
Safety and progress made. Do you have the perks that give you extra defense when you carry x amount of junk, because I like that one
---
The Hard Times is a punk/gamer parody site.  They have some great stuff. 
---
Of course it makes sense. Spend you caps now. The more the better. Buy caps for new limited time items coming in. Make sense now? ;)
---
Badass, thank you for posting this!
---
Thanks for sharing man!
---
Of course they will, once desirability has been generated.
---
I was usually fine on the acid lake. But after I showed a bunch of people my nicely furnished camp, some of them started to claim the spot.
---
That's okay, though. I moved to [the overpass](https://i.imgur.com/apsclWL.png) just south of Harper's Ferry. It's close to two useful locations and it's really, really time-consuming to build underneath the overpass so people rarely challenge me for it.
---
\[grumble\]  
---
Why yes, we should have some sort of tag signifying that we are "**Looking for Group**"... that's a good idea.   
---
(makes me google simple crap... #old)  
---
\[/grumble\]
---
I love it when someone stumbles upon my camp while I'm there and doesn't start attacking it or me.  It's fun to see other players outfits or just the gratitude of a player who needed a safe place to rest up and repair their items.  The interactions are really fun at times.
---
&gt; what if the Handmade is set to be in between 0 and 0.001 instead? You'd get randomly get 1 in 100 drops on average.
---
One in a thousand in that case, but nevermind: I sense a big disappointment coming when you have accumulated sufficient numbers and done the math. In an ideal world, Bethesda's RNG loot algorithm would be step-wise, or cascading: 50:50 chance if it's an armor piece or a weapon, then a 50:50 chance for ranged or melee, then your 1:23 chance for any prefix, then further dice rolls for 2nd and 3rd tier effects, if any.
---
What I am a bit afraid of that it will all turn out to be instead: the loot table being exactly that, a giant database table with any permutation of all possible weapon and armor types and all possible legendary effects, and any entry has an equal chance of being your drop (of course the table will be queried with the enemy level as an argument, but that could be all). This would explain the prevalence of armor drops (with five possible bodypart types simply the biggest subset), and it would be the fastest possible algorithm for the server, much more than the cascading algorithm taking all the various sub branches of different length into account (that would be a nightmare of hundreds of IFs and ELSEs to code, and you know that the devs for Anthem screwed that one up, bigly).
---
That would come down to: with tens of thousands of possible combinations (let's randomly say 50,000, but maybe the real number is way higher), any particular drop has a 1:50,000 chance to happen. And even if you focus on ranged drops: it will only be a 1:23 chance for a particular prefix if they can all equally apply to any ranged weapon. Zealot's and Nocturnal sure can, but can Two Shot and Quad as well? And I don't think 46 drops would have any significant statistical meaning, at all. I would go with an absolute minimum of 30 times the possible variations, so that would be 690 drops, before I'd draw any conclusions. Anything below that is at best anecdotal.
---
Yea I think if your on a team you can
---
Just need one card per run. 
---
You only need one card if you don't mis-type the code it's best to have a spare just in case you type the code wrong you have a back up. It's one card per code imput, right or wrong it costs 1 card.
---
It seems about 50/50 for me whether or works or does what you said
---
You only need one card, you place it into the panel on the left, the code goes into the panel on the right. Then you're ready to launch. The passphrase is only for decoding the code.
---
Thanks for clarifying.  I did not know that. Picked up new information as well
---
Oh, you poor poor thing. Karen, stop skinning those bears and help this dude... 
---
No. Every other day I do an inventory purge and transfer what I dont need to the other account.
---
There are some good flat areas around the bog to the East of top of the world that also have resource nodes. Lead, steel and such. Lead one between the northern end of the bog and wendigo cave. 
---
If you're looking for defensible there's a lead mode down the cliff just north of that certain deathclaw for a quest and its west-southwest of the fast travel point from too of the world. Can build up against the cliff side and anything that attacks has to fight uphill.
---
Yes! I have 2!! I‚Äôm going for it boys wish me luck!! XB1 GT is domafett513 if you want to join in and help?
---
i have a spare nukecard on ps4 if anyone wants to buy this week :).
---
Have fun I'd join you but it's nearly 1am for me lol
---
Only had it pop up 3 times so far, worked fine each time
---
^ This
---
It's especially prominent if you're pulling an entire area's spawn into one spot. The ones from furthest away will disappear on death and their remains will appear back at their spawn location. 
---
Hell√∂ br√∂ther
---
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs literally a promo image from Bethesda prior to when the game launched...
---
what are the legendary effects?
---
i have a few weapons or amour we could trade or i have caps if good enough to buy :).
---
psn - Chronic\_Coit.
---
will be online at about 5pm aus time
---
Yeah, I've only ever had one player attack my camp.   Thankfully a teammate knew exactly where this guy's camp was and led me to it.  I dropped an orbital strike on it.   So, his, was the only camp I've attacked to date.  
---
I've had great player interactions otherwise and I really like seeing what other people come up with for their camps.   I also like shedding some of the weight that I'm carrying around when it seems like they can benefit from it.   (Always better for me to stumble across a lower level player's camp than a higher level player's camp.   Less of what I have can benefit the higher level one unless they just happen to needs some materials or I have extra of their favorite ammo type.)
---
Not yet, I can‚Äôt play until later tonight 
---
Glad the Nixie clock was free, as it does not show the time - ones Pipboy does.
---
I like the game a lot, but so many things seem half finished or rushed. A constant wave of hype and disappointment. Not giving up yet, as this is the game I've always wanted.
---
i assume it is supposed to be stronger with both legs. but as far as i know it does not work the way it should. causing no impact damage
---
Honestly I'd also do that and I wouldn't call it pay-to-win either so there shouldn't be many objections from the community.
---
What? I'm trying to help the community?
---
So do you need it?
---
Swing speed bleed damage bloodied effect and 1 endurance 
---
East of Middle Mountain Cabins and North of Emmett Mountain Disposal is a little lake/pond I tend to camp at.  No resources that I‚Äôve seen though, but plenty of water
---
Prob covered but would like see that you can have profiles say melee you have these perk cards, riflemen you have the right perk cards and to alter game play you just choose the profile you need, saves time swapping in and out cards like at a vendor you have to spend time switching perks for better trading.
---
Oh okay that makes sense. I just waddle around the map looking for trinkets, I scrap all of the guns and armor I don't need and keep moving. I don't purge though and at this rate I should transfer so I can have a junk empire.
---
I'm the bear man, I'm here for your junk.
---
I've never attacked someone else's camp so far.  Never had a need to.  I posted my camp a while ago but I'll post it here so you can see what I did personally.  I need to take new pictures inside since I've moved things around a bit.  https://m.imgur.com/gallery/QOw7PJY
---
camp storage should start off currently at that allotment, but allow you to buy up to a max of 2K stash space (100 per 100 atoms maybe) also do something similar with camp budget, bumping it up by 10% per purchase. 
---
if they also wanted to make people buy a better pacifist mode i would also go for that, a version where your name is baby blue, you take and deal NO PVP damage and your camp is immune to PVP damage (it also has baby blue health bars). 
---
turning it on disables access to contesting workshops and forfeits them if you have it on when someone attempts to take it from you. if it is owned by someone else then you cannot claim it without turning off Super Pacifist 
---
Welcome to gaming.  It really is a great escape that books or movies can not provide.  Just be careful.  The more stressful your life the more that carefree game time can consume you.
---
You're right. But I wish more players and Bethesda devs would look towards Warframe. A true F2P game making copius amounts of money, because they have a different approach:
---
**Make the player love the game and its makers.**
---
Personally, I very likely would be against that, depending on how it was implimented. Big QoL improvements for Atoms... Could get messy.
---
Did you stop reading halfway through? Look at the edit at the bottom
---
Its taking me a while to really read your response. Sorry for not thanking you sooner stranger!
---
Lmao! You can sleep when your dead!!! XD
---
In this buggy mess of a game everything is an exploit to everybody. I don't see a problem with this method. It has a cost involved and only awards experience. 300 is not a huge amount. Spending 300+ aluminum got me like 60-70% of a level. That was all of the aluminum is gathered in a week. 
---
Sorry friend, I don't mean any offense, it's awesome that you're offering help.  But you don't actually need any of the code pieces unless you're trying to decode the code yourself, which almost nobody does because it's a [pain in the ass](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ygyy9/stepbystep_guide_to_decrypting_launch_codes). You really just need a keycard and nukacrypt.com. 
---
They are just giving you a hard time...no one gathers the cards anymore they wait for the code to be cracked then just go in with a key card 
---
Are they leaving permanently or is this like the 'Disney vault' where they will return for sale at some point? I think this needs to be made plain and clear so consumers aren't misled into FOMO purchases.
---
Fuck this quest in March 2019
---
My new screensaver now
---
yea for sure, i was just offering something that might give you a taste of it.
---
wolfs/dogs used to have a chance to drop Dog armor due to them having it in their drop table in FO4 so hopefully down the road they add a quest for dog companions 
---
People's gonna flip 100%. They gonna cry p2w bethesda didn't live up to their words and shiet. Those youtubers gonna make about 500 videos about it. Well, gotta get dem mule accounts 60 bucks
---
Swapping perks around is really key.
---
My usual Luck perks are Bloody Mess, Starched Genes and Class Freak, but I swap in Super Duper when making food, drinks, ammo, stable flux, stimpaks, or anything besides bulked scrap.  Swapping in Ammosmith and Super Duper helps tremendously when making a bunch of ammo.  The same with Chemist and Super Duper when making glowing blood packs and Radshield (you learn the recipe during a side quest in the Mire).  I also swap my normal Glow Sight or Gunsmith for lock picking or hacking when I want to access a locked safe or door.

Speaking from Personal Experience, I have never had to craft anything that required 550 asbestos scrap. Which is how much of that crap I had in my stash 2 days ago. #freeyourself #dropthatshit  
---
;)

Turn your addiction to good. Start Santa Clausing new players. Craft a bunch of level appropriate gear for newbs. Leave gift bags in Flatwoods with Black Ti scrap, screws and springs. Give away your favorite power armor to a lower level character.  See a level 2 about to leave 76? Give that fellow vault dweller a nicely upgraded set of Leather Shadowed Deep Pocketed armor (level 1 of course), over repaired to hell and back.  Become the neighborhood elf.

If you have an aggregate stash weight of over 2K, your freaking base better make Todd Howard drop in for tea... ;)

This is sooo epically wonderful to hear. There‚Äôs this place where I go where‚Äôs there‚Äôs lightening bugs and the gentle sound of the wind chimes. It calms me this game and when I play with friends it‚Äôs just soo enjoyable, friends I‚Äôve made playing this game. I‚Äôm on XB1 GT ohnomitorta I usually play with my hubby so if you ever need a laid back chill group with nothing but dad jokes, come by my camp for carrot soup firebugs and my husbands bad jokes. 
---
Thanks!
---
wait what am i missing? my base is right at whitespring looking oh so nice next to the little bridge
---
Sorry - missed the second part of your post. It takes 10 raw flux + 1 hardened mass + 1 glowing mass + 1 high radiation fluids = 1 stable/pure flux. All of the above come from nukes areas - make sure green thumb is equipped.

They run away to take the programed path to get to your location. Sometimes, you smash in an I programmed spot and they end up running all the way around the map.

git gud (with salt)

So you have money to burn, who cares.

run good with salt on my main constantly to combat food spoilage rates, i never would have thought that i would have lost cranberries in the less than hour it took me to get them and walk back to camp. hadnt planned on getting good with salt on this character until after 50 so i could keep her dps up for faster xp gains.  
---
my complaint is less than 12 hours game time, something spoils.. to me thats a tad overboard.
---
Or just have it give option to use caps, not cheap obviously (maybe your cap limit). Problem solved
---
Thanks! Lots of fun to be had in the trees!
---
Just about every weapon I use, first shot always misses even at 95%. Only times it doesn't miss are when I kinda give it about 5 seconds before shooting or if I leave vats and reenter. Really annoying bug, especially since I use a gauss rifle.
---
Same problem on PC
---
Yes. We can purify water and prepare food but not take a bath or use proper toilets! My wife saw my dude in his underwear and remarked "Nice bod but no wonder you have all those worms."
---
3k caps

Where did you find the plans?
---
This went a different way than I expected, and I'm glad it did. :)

Also make sure Super Duper is equipped!

Yep, except the secret bunkers opens to reveal a ‚òÜ Nocturnal Laser Pistol.
---
I am going to pound this joke into dust.
---
I have had it happen to me a lot. I first figured out what was happening in Fort Defiance that the bodies that vanished teleport back to their spawn point. In fort defiance the ghouls go back to their position of laying on the floor. You can melee the body anywhere from 1-30 times and it will do one of several things. Stand up, walk forward, walk backward, walk in a circle, stand up and and twitch in place. After you have attacked the body and make this happen you can then loot the body. Or you can wait till it turns into a meat pile. The problem is not all turn into meat piles and not all show back up to their spawn points. I have found that when the spawn is a "wanderer" meaning the don't need to wake up or be startled they rarely go to their spawn, they often completely vanish. 
---
I have had this bug happen to many different creatures. Mainly happens to ghouls or scorched but also happens to many other mobs. The bigger creatures never seem to be able to be looted again. I had it happen to a mega sloth and it respawned 15 feet in the air. I could hit it, I could not loot it. It never turned into a meat pile. 
---
If you come across an enemy that is laying on the ground but does not show up as an enemy and has no tag it is probably the body of something you or another killed previously that teleported back to the spawn. 
---
I wanted to type this out so someone might see this if they search this bug. This is all I know about it. I have experienced it a lot.
---
Start a new character, go to bugged locations.  
---
Any challenges completed during BETA don't count, as well as trophies for leaving the vault etc.
---
I think snowman has it he'll buy for 3000caps lol.
---
I don't even sell my tse's for that much 
---
Yes! That üëÜ
---
Did you start playing before or after they added the achievements? Iirc they were not activated retroactively. You need to start a new character to get them.
---
Yah that would probably be the case, but it would also be nice for when you not in game and you see someone looking for an item (here or somewhere else) and you want to check if you have that item. Also it would be another excuse to wear my Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV (fallout 4) while playing lol
---
I've been offered 7k on Facebook for it lol 
---
What are the deets on it? I'm interested. What system?
---
Add your platform so people know if they can trade with you or not
---
In a team or not, once you drop out, any paper bag of your stuff fizzles away
---
Actually I was thinking about donating supples to the players that were looking for the secret ending but I think that ship has sailed. I want to help put my low level friends but they dont play much.
---
Not sure if I got it, gt TurdFergusonn 
---
My phone should have given me a notification, didn't see it yet. 
---
I like it.  It's sitting on my nightstand now and looks very cool.
---
Does it really work? I've like 3 characters and I just can't get unlock Grafton Dam location. Is it just my bad luck or does it not work for everyone else?
---
&gt; A guy claiming to work for Bethesda is in a party with my German friend, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs bad translation but he seems to be hinting at repercussions.

My dad works at Bethesda and says it's all good. No worries man.

But seriously, sounds like chain rattling to guilt/scare you. Open PVP like this is what they hype up. Don't even trip dawg.

underrated comment!!!
---
Mod plans are on vendors now as of the last patch. The excavator PA mods are on a couple vendors around the Ash Heap. The T-XX mod plans are on Watoga and Harper‚Äôs Ferry. Raider mods are on a couple raider vendors in the Savage Divide. There‚Äôs no plans for X-01 mods, just the mods themselves from the enclave vendors . Actual armor piece plans are still incredibly rare.  
---
The post you‚Äôre responding to is 3 months old :)

I started on Christmas of this year. So Im not sure when these were activated. I found some locations sort of recently though thats why im so confused

It may not be pay to win, but it is still a shit idea.

1 the legendaries I hoarded were being saved for the legendary vendor patch. The other 150 lbs was ammo. Mostly unused types and fusion cores. Honestly ending up 350 lbs overweight when combining two characters isn't all that bad
---
2 if I wanted to just play through to get it all back without saying anything, I would have. My point is that with everything that they have given us they still have major bugs with base equipment that is destroying people's playing experience that have been there since day 1 but nobody cares to fix
---
Huh? I sent it for sure because I tried to again just now and it‚Äôs not an option anymoreü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è same profile pic too
---
If your on PS4 Ill pay handsomely 
---
Maybe you can hit me up when your done. How long until after you get off before you make it home to get on? Just curious lol no rush!!!
---
I run a support heavy gunner and would love this idea. 
---
Most of my build is focused on team play and debuffing enemies [supressor perk and supressing weapons, one man army, and the one that increases damage taken] 
---
I usually send team invites to players I run across but only have about a 10% acceptance rate.
---
Too much radiation maybe. Try seeing your local Responders Bot or member.
---
Heeeey sorry, I got it. Just on a break between meetings here and trying to get caught up, i just had to force close the app and it popped. 
---
Sorry Xbox. Two star level 45. 
---
oh, the dam one doesnt work for me on any character either.
---
Maybe theres a specific spot you need to stand, but I can't find it.
---
I agree. All of my meat and vegetables were spoiled the other day after an extended session of play. Even the cooked stuff. I've never seen it go so quickly until this past week.

Probably be on about 9:15 Central.

ARRRRRGVGGHHH

He wandered by to the Whitespring golf club while it was nuked.  I briefly looked at his inventory, but I was getting over-run by glowing bloated ones...
---
 So excuse my ignorance, but isn't a bloodied melee weapon a bit useless? I mean you will toast the guys you hit, but any incoming will kill you. 
---
I picked up Good With Salt in the beta and ran with it all the way until I started getting ahold of mutation serums and I needed Starched Genes and Class Freak. I noticed a *huge* difference, it was ridiculous.

Yeah. Worry about the players named ‚Äúxxx69sexgodkillugood‚Äù

Well I for one am absolutely shocked that this convoluted, thinly-supported theory that flew in the face of data mined evidence turned out to be incorrect.

Very interesting...
---
I play a sniper and always carry a couple cryo grenades to lure hidden enemies, such as mirelurk queens, out of hiding.  I don't really use them for DPS, just as a method of getting enemies milling around in curiosity so I can initiate battle passively.
---
Back in earlier Fallout games, I'd ALWAYS have 4-6 bottlecap or plasma mines to lay down on chokepoints and doorways, so when I engaged combat enemies coming to investigate from uncleared areas would get an unpleasant surprise.  Unfortunately, I've found that mines are all but useless in 76.  The timer is long enough that most enemies will run across and through the blast, taking little to no damage and avoiding crippled legs entirely, or the mine disappears after a few minutes.  Laying traps was pretty key to my strategy in Fo3, NV and 4, but it doesn't seem to be effective at all in 76.  Mines used to be my "fabric softener" when dealing with deathclaws and sentry bots.  They become so much less dangerous when you cripple the legs.

I just fought her last night. It was a long fight but we downed her around 20-25minutes in. PC. Haven‚Äôt had many since the patch but we‚Äôve downed her every one I‚Äôve been on. Not the 3 minute fights I‚Äôd seen near the end of last patch though; typically 15-25 minutes.

I'm also an attorney who enjoys his video games. I can understand the rigors of practice and the pains of anxiety and depression; I have dealt with them somewhat myself.
---
I can only say that I truly hope you can find peace and employment that you won't despise. I know you said you cannot retire, but why not consider and explore other employment? There's so much to do as an attorney that isn't even law related. Non profits, think tanks, teaching, etc. Reach out and see what you can find! 
---
At any rate, just my 2 cents. So glad you enjoy the game and that it's helped you through some difficult times! 
---
Saying something negative about anthem is NOT saying something positive about 76.  I can say i hate brussell sprouts and then say that brussell sprouts are better than another food item, but still hate brussell sprouts
---
What‚Äôs you‚Äôre platform? On PC, I can craft all heavy weapons, I think the lowest craftable is 25, which is around when you first start getting perks for them.
---
 Its pointless. I have less than 40lbs of non junk. I can make any damn thing. ;)
---
 Its all just junk, the cute Gnomes are just junk. You'll get used to it. Until then,  keep that Excavator in good repair.
---
That's just what a legendary hoarder would say. 
---
You mean, the Toddman? 
---
I'm not sure but I try to at least ask permission.  Only seems fair
---
I know this is an old post but i get what you mean, its a workshop and its meant for pvp, you shouldn't get wanted for destroying those turrets. Im having the same complaint
---
I mean like...you get Atoms in game. For free. And half the time for stupidly simple things. Literally breathe in the right direction and you get 10 or 20 Atoms. Fire a shotgun at the Scorchbeast Queen and bam you just got 10 Atoms for killing a Mole Rat you probably didn't even know was there. Wander into an empty workshop, claim it, and oh look holy shit more free Atoms bc it was a weekly challenge.
---
I love my heavy weapons build, but heavy weapons (basically) require power armor, and some people hate power armor. 
---
Yeah i know that, like i said in another comment this is a second character i run good with salt on my main (lvl 221) to combat spoilage. But concentrated on getting perks to increase dps to help me kill faster as i leveled the 33..
---
I never would have imagined picking "fresh" fruit it would be spoiled in less than an hour or less than an ingame afternoon.. i could see 48 hours, maybe even 24 hours in game but less than 12 game hours?

Fallout 76 has a wonderful community most of the time.

What serums?

That's what turrets are for, friend B)

Mutation serums , like  marsupial speed demon etc

You have all of them?

Just yesterday night I had a level 76 show up at my base, I'm level 51.  I have my filthy casual sign out in front. I saw him stop at the stash box, and over to my junk extractor, then pick some of my crops, then started opening fire on me.  Unfortunately for him I had just finished crafting a fresh set of heavy leather armor and with my perks it was at over 100% condition. I stood there as he kept shooting me. I have pacifist turned on and I decided not to return fire.  After around 25 shots I was only down to 75% health. Rather than waste my ammo on him I logged out.
---
Some people are just douchebags.

What the hell

Right?!

Couldn't help but chuckle
---
And sell the excess raw flux. Be aware that when they decay to inert, they have a weight of 1. 
---
How much is it going for?
---
Yeah, I shot down two cargo bots and took the nuke cards yesterday night. It was really odd..... I have never seen one of those cargo bots in over a hundred hours of playing and I saw two of them yesterday night within an hour. I have no use for the cards so I sold them to a vendor for 20 caps each.
---
Totally agree.  Happened to me over the weekend.  Was level 18.  Took me to their camp, converted my blood packs to like 24 diluted stimpacks, made me a few weapons, then took me to area with death claws.  Let me get in my shot then killed for me.
---
Awesome!
---
I know its pointless, I just can't help myself. Ideally I'd just have a rifle a melee weapon ammo and meds. I love the gnomes though, I had a gnome shrine on Fallout 3, I must pray to the gnome gods.
---
Speed demon, scaly skin, marsupial?
---
Hey I do still have it. If you still want it its yours. Shoot me a message on XBL GT- NCCxPwnSausage
---
Honestly what do you think would be reasonable. I‚Äôve never had one before so I‚Äôm just trying to get it outta here. 
---
I live over at Site Alpha. Nice enough place, there is water if you do decide you'd like a purifier, and the enemies usually aren't too bad, some mole rats, dogs, an occasional pair of Super Mutants, and sometimes Scorched/Feral Ghoul Officers just come rushing to give you their code piece.
---
I have them except scaly that ones hard to make coal is a hassle to buy n make so I rarely have it 
---
I don‚Äôt know if anyone has done the research on this. I‚Äôve been trying to find the answer too. I think ‚Äúharder to detect‚Äù is usually a secondary or tertiary effect on legendaries from what I‚Äôve seen from traders (the exceptions being the quest reward Stand Fast armor). Chameleon on the other hand is usually a primary legendary effect. I‚Äôve been trying to accumulate both armors and test them because I hate not being able to use gun sights with chameleon. In FO4, I think each chameleon piece would add a 20% stealth field, so you get more benefit from more pieces. Not sure if ‚Äúharder to detect‚Äù was in FO4.

Don't limit yourself to living at a deposit spot. Unless if that's specifically what you're after... Just wonder until you feel inspired by a location.  Hoever, The deposits can be great locations, usually 
---
No 
---
Would 2500  caps be ok?
---
I've thought about it more and 100 fuel for 200 caps is still drastically worse than most weapons. 100 fuel doesn't last nearly as long as 100 5.56 or 100 45acp in my opinion. I think it should be like 50caps for 100 fuel 
---
I have tested it multiple times. I have only once gotten one of the special events to trigger and that was when the house was in a specific spot. Going across the other bridge generally still works, but I have never gotten the vendor to spawn there. 
---
They all aren't that good but I'll buy them lol  add me 
---
You do know that theyre very easy to get and cost nothing if you do the quest
---
They all aren't that good but I'll buy them! Lol
---
Fuck him and fuck the approach 
---
I get if you are a low level pulling that shit but if you are perked out and decked out you are a complete lazy chickenshit.   I am high enough level to kill anyone immediately chamleoned or not.  I will take great pleasure in bringing those fools some pain.  Then I will decimate their ‚Äúcamp‚Äù and send them back to their mammies crying all the way home.  
---
I cleared and reapplied so many times it keeps bugging out.

I am game! im on PS4 let me know

I will start farming nuclear key cards!

Last night I paid 4K for a 3* level 50 so probably 3k ish. Depends on how bad whoever wants it really.

Yeah, I‚Äôm not going to sell good stuff wholesale‚Äîbut thought you might be trying to build an inventory or stockpile for legendary vendor. 
---
So, THAT'S what the rest of your camp look like?  Not that I expect you to remember, but about a month ago (maybe a little more than that?) was your camp parked on the south of the map right on top of a junk extractor location?   I recognize the fusion generator downstairs and the locked door, though I was looking at it from inside the locked area, so I never got to see the rest of the place.  I was in the process of dropping you a bag of all kind of stuff INCLUDING some fertilizer (but some good stuff too) and then the camp disappeared out from under me.  I fell to the ground and my bag was stuck up in mid air where I couldn't reach it.  It was that moment that I decided not to drop anything of any value for anyone that wasn't home because they could just leave and I wouldn't be able to retrieve the stuff I dropped for them.   If memory serves correctly, there was an open floor pit at the bottom with a junk extractor and a row of corn.  I don't remember if there was a row of another kind of veggie, but I remember the corn. (I very likely picked it all while I was down there, not that you noticed.)   Man, I wish I could have left a "post it note" or a "sticker" or something stuck to one of your walls that says: "BC Was Here" just so that you could have run across it later on.
---
No joke, true story.  If that wasn't your camp, they had a nearly identical downstairs, but I don't recall there being a decontamination arch, so it would have had to have been before that.
---
What are you willing to pay (either per piece) or for all? 
---
I did not
---
I may have to carry a second helmet then... I use the highlight enemies mod for faster target acquisition 
---
fo76 went so far to shit it wasn't fun anymore to pick on it. It's been like three literal months of people just yelling about how bad the game is in this sub. Everyone knows every bug. Plus, they've done enough that it's finally starting to look like it should have at launch.  
---
Anthem just has the honor of being the new kid to get picked on, that people aren't tired of hearing about yet. It's got a lot of issues, but it's still massively fun to play. People are blowing stuff \*wayyyy\* out of proportion with regard to what's bad, and Bioware is still scrambling to fix bugs  (and doing 1000% better than Bethesda did)
---
You're comparing a trash fire to the Pacific garbage patch.
---
Hah that‚Äôs a good one didn‚Äôt think about that.

\*farts in your direction, haughtily trots away\*

A Pip-Boy app like for FO4 would be friggin' sweet.
---
I bet they did nazi that coming.

/not sorry
---
Why are we talking about white dudes south of the Mason-Dixon line? I thought we were talking about Germans.
---
Adrenal and SiN were fine before the patch. SiN broke some other perks/mutation combos though.
---
What‚Äôs you‚Äôre gt dude?
---
Many.  I hate using a controller and I need mods to give me some Qol -the bugs are driving me nuts.
---
I think there is a bug where if you fast travel to a location to join a friend, it will not count. And since you have already discovered it, you can't "rediscover" it. That's why starting a new character works.
---
There's a junk pile directly across the street from the Pleasant Valley Station. I usually build my camp there when I'm working on Rose's quests.
---
Man, I thought I was slick using my PA as a ladder, that VATS gernade jump is awesome.
---
Unless it‚Äôs somehow *both*, my bet is it‚Äôs Scorched in relation to legendary effects.
---
You can buy those plans from vendor bots at Watoga and harpers ferry
---
ima just hope it gets changed soon
---
One would think that. If I were a betting man that‚Äôs were my money would be. I‚Äôve heard both sides of the argument but have seen no definitive proof. 
---
yep in watoga. and not jsut graham . legendary graham.  laser rifle toting legendary graham. 
---
You‚Äôll notice I literally never stated my opinion on the game. 
---
 So just shoot the sucker then, Cool. ;)
---
Pay no attention to them fools!  Scrap your bears today, and one of tomorrow's daily challenges will be to scrap 10 bears, and you'll have to drag your overencumbered, double calibrated excavator butt to all the spots where you know there are bears, except somebody else already picked them up so it's off to the next spot.  Next day it will be scrap 10 gnomes while wearing a swimsuit and a beer hat, which you were carrying for 2 months but scrapped yesterday.
---
Count me in.  ecoliguy, level 69 (nice), on PC.
---
I don‚Äôt have any numbers howeverfrom my experience  though my instigating shotgun will deal half of a super mutants total health first shot then the second takes him to 25 then the third shot finishes him so I would assume it does double the total damage as if it was just base damage I would see less damage in my first shot. 
---
Stockpile for legendary vendor is exactly what im doing haha i will be on in a hr or 2 
---
Sweet will do! I'll be on in 5
---
Watch Bethesda probably never implement this but will later
---
Yes sold
---
I‚Äôm dumb, what weapons are those?
---
Please let everyone at bethsoft (or just around you) know that your games are absolutley amazing and nobody does it like you guys and BGS has brought more joy into my life then I could of ever hoped for.
---
~Life-long fan.
---
I had several players save me that way when I first started playing the game. My assumption based on limited &amp; mostly negative experiences in other games was that they wanted something from me or were likely to murder me next. 
---
In general my experiences with other players in this game have been better than any previous online gaming attempts. I primarily avoided it prior to this 
---
thanks so much for ur reply, i've noticed the same too, I just wanted to confirm with someone else
---
Awesome! My gt is my name here, are you on now?
---
Good use for the flare gun. Shoot up a flare and go into matchmaking.
---
Doing Rose's queat as a hoarder is rough, I felt like I was walking WV in real time. 
---
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille...
---
So you added the three ba2 files and items are still invisible? I'm not really sure what else it could be then. That fixed it right away for me and the other purple I've talked to.
---
I don't think the perk manager would be causing it. I also use that and it works fine now that it's been updated, though I agree it's slightly more annoying to use than it used to be.
---
Have you updated all of your mods? Do you use anything that requires the baka tool? I don't have any experience with that myself so I'm not sure if it could be causing other issues.
---
You realize there is a forum for trading right? Multiples even?  I dont know why the mods allow trade posts cluttering up this sub...
---
Awesome, thank you. Would it be worth it to sell site code pieces?
---
Maybe there are some gamers nearby in this forum who might wanna come over and game together in person. Could be worth creating a thread and asking. I have a strong preference for couch co-op
---
Truth!
---
If youre talking about the ones you find on ghouls and scorhed then no, i usually just type Fallout nuke codes on the reddit search bar and find the newest codes
---
You can actually just clear Point Pleasant, where the Mothman Museum is, a couple of times. They are all level 1-6, and drop an arrangement of all 3 pipe weapons and a couple melees. I got over half the mods for all 3 from one run. My level 10 Pipe Bolt-Action currently does 75 damage with only 1 rank each in Gunslinger and Rifleman with a Hardened receiver. My revolver rifle does 54. Alas the regular pipe pistols do not benefit from the double dipping, which makes me think it just be intentional because that one would then benefit from 3 with an automatic receiver.
---
Apologies, only been on a couple of weeks and only ever used the fo/76 forums. Can you link to the trading ones please? Many thanks

You‚Äôre becoming a Ghoul. 
---
Game data says no, but let people have their fun
---
Or google nukacrypt
---
oooo that reminds me, I need to back and finish my 6 story hotel on spectacle island.
---
I think since the pistol is the only one capable of being made an automatic and that it was left out of the double dipping, that would make me lean towards intentional. I mentioned 3, but it would actually benefit from 4 damage perks if it benefited the same way as the other two.
---
same same
---
I apologize for offending you so. 
---
Every time I read that EEEAHHHH! I just picture Jon Tron.
---
Imagine a two-shot, exploding, furious automatic pipe rifle with maxed out rifleman, gunslinger, commando, guerilla, and demolition expert perks. Talk about a game breaking weapon. 
---
300 to 500 caps each
---
Truthful I feel you   They hotfix certain things but this glitch has been happening for months. 
---
you can kill them easily with VATS. when they die, their corpse goes back to normal.
---
Your fine as long as you 10 turrets aren't pointed at the back of the clubhouse.
---
only with crits i think, at least when they're stuck insive buildings sometimes they dont take damage even if their bodies peek out and they die stuck inside the walls
---
I can probably walk it off, right?
---
This implementation to the Passive Mode will be a game changer, no more worries about anything regarding PvP. If i see a group of 200 level people, i wont be pushed away from world hopping or just not going in that general area.
---
It‚Äôs a beautiful looking game but man, that‚Äôs a lot of money for such little content and forced grouping in open world missions.
---
On the bright side, we should be able to get Anthem for 20$ very soon now. Then we can let the disc or download sit until it gets more content and stuff gets fixed.
---
They're quest items and cannot be removed from your inventory. 
---
The card can, but it's not worth that much. 
---
Cool
---
The .50 cal and the mini gun.
---
Slowly kill them with radiation 
---
It only works of you mod them into rifles. All pipe weapons are pistols all the time, but they are only rifles is they have a stock; then they are Rifled Pistols. (Which ironically has to do with the grooves in the barrel and not the stock of the weapon irl).
---

---
The Devs can restore items, or a Database tech as well. Customer service can't. They aren't granted permission to those tools. That's why they tell you no - the database guys can't be bothered. 
---
I've lost items due to server instability. I know many others have too. If I ever lost my best AAE I'd just quit. Take note, Beth. Fix ur shit please. So easy to fix this if you can just mark an item not to be dropped, traded, sold, or scrapped if it's a favorite. A MOD DID THIS months ago but now it's abandoned and broke after game updates.
---
I love the game but hate Bugthesda and their priorities like PVP no one wants.. instead of fixing horrible UI and customer service. üò™

Why the down votes? I was asking if it supports ultrawide display... Interesting hive mind here.  
---
There already is one?
---
Giant sloths don‚Äôt do backstory.
---
The regular .38 pipe pistol does not get to double dip sadly. I assume it's because it's an automatic, and would then technically be able to pull from 5 different damage buffs and the two accura CV y and distance buffs, plus the hipfire and limb damage buffs. And the demolition buff if explosive. That gun would literally be the only weapon anyone used if it got to double dip lol.
---
Lol 
---
It‚Äôs a sales strategy. Like Taco Bell‚Äôs nacho fries
---
Thanks for the replies. I've been thinking a lot about it and I think if the playthrough is JUST different enough, It warrants making a new character.
---
To even handle the spacing constraints with the launch stash size, I opted to only keeping weapons that were in line with my character build, and realizing that I probably won't ever use the others, even if I wanted to feel like a cow boy with a revolver, or a maniac with a DCG. 
---
In general, when I play online games, I try to come up with a play style that lets me both enjoy the game fully and to specialize. Especially with RPGs. For class based games and mmo's like WoW, I opted to playing as many classes as possible since they're all different enough for me to enjoy each differently.
---
For survival games, what I'm noticing is that I play a conservative approach at first and then feel the need to bridge out after I've learned the ropes. With keeping specialization in mind, on my first playthrough I'll play with the aim of fitting into a certain 'mold' with the intention to explore as much as I possibly can and to survive through content. Not really to engage in reckless play throughs. 
---
After I make some mistakes and also learn and become comfortable, I think I'll start looking to other play throughs. Maybe a more raider pvp based, or a team oriented medic responder character, while keeping in mind advantages and lessons learned from my play through (IE: carry weights, advantages of mele weapons in certain situations over others, crafting, etc).
---
For now, If it warrants it like someone said, I'll make a new character. Like if I'm not planning on using power armor at all and more agility based perks that depart from my power armor heavy weapons build.
---
As far as I know I don't think you can jump in anyone else's power armor but I might be mistaken. I know I've come across frames someone had left stripped bare and I couldn't even put a fusion core in. Someone at Bethesda must've left their car running while they ran into a gas station in the hood or something.
---
They‚Äôll take it out of the vault eventually
---
Hmm, since a Jackson‚Äôs chameleon is Trioceros jacksonii, perhaps Radiatius jacksonii.
---
Mine doesn't light up. Glad it was free.
---
This post makes me realize how sad it is that it‚Äôs not done like this anymore. It was one of the only way to encourage player interaction in the game. 
---
I got one once a long time ago. Appeared as a quest. And didn‚Äôt get update or flash on screen. 
---
Pretty sure you just break down hunting rifles to get that mod.
---
This assumes all alternate characters know one another.  That‚Äôs highly unlikely, from a role-playing aspect that you are basing your suggestion on.
---
Watoga vendors are where I got both my plan and mod. 
---
All Rise is the answer to every enemy/situation except when the scorchbeast flies...
---
Nah, he's up in the Commonwealth at Parsons sharing a cell with Lorenzo Cabot.
---
That would work. At every train station have a board where you can post job offers and whoever accepts the offer gets added to your team
---
Alright add me on psn: Beurdrinkinbuddy

I‚Äôm on now

My results using the average of 5 tests. I only have 1 Endurance so Rejuvenated is only level 1. All my tests were run well hydrated with 240 AP. I also have mutations running but I don't think they affect AP refresh (Bird Bones, Eagle Eyes, Empath, Marsupial, Speed Demon).

I think server lag has a lot to do with these numbers.

Fallout wiki points to a mutated Jackson's chameleon 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deathclaw

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson%27s_chameleon
---

---
So probably something like Trioceros jacksonii extremus
---
Thank you :)
---
Which mutations are broken besides adrenal reaction?
---
Scrap the kind of gun that you want a bayonet for until you get the plan, and then add it to your favorite gun through the weapon workshop.
---
This. This is why I love this game. 
---
Are you allowed to do other work on the side? Paid or otherwise? Not in terms of a huge commitment since you wouldn't even have the time or ability, I mean more like an hour here and there.
---
I won't get into my own experience but it involved felony level DV which I couldn't do much about while homeless and unemployed. Public defenders are horribly overworked and underpaid, and the number of lawyers who are willing to donate pro bono time seem few. Especially in a "off the record, this doesn't count as true legal advice" kind of way.
---
If I'd had a resource I could easily consult that way in person vs on Reddit or etc, I think it could have made a big difference. And since it sounds like one of your biggest frustrations is that you're actually ethical and really wanted to help people, it could allow you to use your talents and knowledge in a way where other lawyers couldn't block you or easily interfere. 
---
Taking on more work when already stressed sounds crazy, but in my own life I've found that even in my darkest moments the ability to help someone else who was worse off really helped my self esteem. 
---
I'm on PS4 or I would say you should visit my monorail house and take all my plans. But anyone in a similar boat who is should totally add xa0t1ca (the o is a zero). 
---
Right, or maybe its for legendary quest events and you need more people for it or something.
---
Ever figure this out?
---
I have never seen someone put out such a thirsty ass post on a fallout page hahahahahhahaha
---
I thank you, Thot Patroller of the wastes!
---
I have a compulsion to make sure I get the code pieces so it'll stop that damn beeping noise whenever you're in the vicinity. It drives me absolutely bananas every time I hear it somewhere faintly in the distance.

Too skinny, eat some more canned dog food.

Ugh oh I‚Äôm in Ohio! Lol what is the time difference!? 
---
500 a star. 
---
That I understand...
---
No problem üòÅ
---
I have 2 so when I break one in the middle of a scrap (99% of the time) I can swap quickly, it's only when the fight is longer than I expected I have to choose a 'lesser' heavy searing rocket powered sledgehammer;)
---
too much coffee...
---
Early onset scorch plague.
---
One other thing... I used a musical instrument after all the tests above (not during) to get well tuned and put everything I normally use on. My AP bumped to 260 and I refreshed in under 3.3 seconds. 
---
It's part of the daily challenges.  But good call.  Need to boil water.  :)
---
Allegedly completed. No evidence that it was.
---
Not the time or place dude.

Aaahhhhh okay lmfao

Same here ^^ 
---
Nah, you only get the 308 receivers from scrapping. The .50 and .38 receivers are all mod/plan only, and the plans don't appear at vendors since patch 5.
---
Now if I start a new character do those atomic points work across both characters or only the one? Because I'm really only doing the challenge for those rewards
---
It does have ultra wide support
---
It was just inappropriate to post this here and now
---
Ur on drugs... LOL next
---
I‚Äôd love a big flashing screen alert. ‚ÄúWarning, your camp is being f‚Äôd with. Do something you dumbass!‚Äù
---
That's what I'm saying lol
---
I better move out of the way... they‚Äôre lining up like crazy behind me...
---
How can you sell them so cheaply? Do you craft them yourself? How many of the serum plans do you have?
---
So my power armor is taking up space in my stash box for no reason then? Good to know. Kinda sucks that you can't even use frames that have been stripped bare. Will need to remember that for future power armor I find and want to use. 
---
&gt; Data limits or technical limitations.
---
Yea. No. It's neither of these. To temporarily remove items for a length of time and put them on sale right before that is a simple sales tactic. A handful of models and textures is negligible in terms of data, especially the models. There's no limitation. Just a sales tactic. There's no reason to permanently remove them as some of those items haven't even been there that long, and some of those items have been there since release. It would make more sense to only permanently remove items that have been out since release. You may very well have experience around this, and so do I, but you're frankly being pessimistic.
---
No worries I‚Äôll be on 
---
Yes I craft them I got recipes from friends and trading , n I have some extras lmk if wanna buy some serums or offer on recipes 
---
Yeah that makes sense. I've asked all over Twitter and stuff, can't get an answer. Sorry about that.
---
I see that it has an .ini edit which just stretches the image and distorts the HUD. Doesn't seem like it's supported from what I can tell.
---
It's definitely not.

I want my thirst zapper with acid and nuclear cola back. 
---
That's great -- I've played ~300 hours and the only serum plan I got was adrenal reaction from the SBQ.
---
I stopped at around 250ish for all of that. And everything else at 150
---
Does that perk work if the junk is scrapped?
---
I have a hard time throwing them away but I‚Äôm thinking around 100 for everything, depending how often you have to repair stuff

Better than the cinematic trailer one ;)

I had my camp on the three brahmin one and loved it
---
I absolutely love Fallout 76.
---
Stopped reading right there. I do not believe you and this entire post is most likely bullshit.
---
Recently did all my treasure maps as well..... you could follow where I went from the trail of junk I dropped after digging it up.
---
Was waiting for level 50 to dig them up and foolishly expected "Treasure", it was akin to emptying my cats litter of its golden treats.
---
Accept the vault didn‚Äôt open for 25 years after the bombs. Are you suggesting the new content is about being transported back in time to the days or weeks following the Great War? Are you also ignoring the lore where the war was actually initiated by the Zetans?

The water n food come back quickly, if the purifiers are unlocked it's free water. I leave mine unlocked, any food or water is for anyone to grab :) also if you notice one purifier is locked and others aren't that's a little hint that you can take those but the one is for them. My home is your home
---
Atoms are for your account not the character. Same with atom shop purchases
---
It almost certainly doubles the damage after the receiver mod. In practice that's often about 2.6x rather than double the HP damage, due to how the damage vs resistance formula works.
---
I think explosive deals additional explosive damage on top of the ballistic damage, but how it interacts with various first-star effects is largely unknown. Too difficult for testers to get the weapons.
---
I went through a pretty rough divorce in 2013. I found out my wife was having affairs. The night I found out I opened up a Facebook account. Over the next several months I opened up accounts on about every social media account. This included match.com, Reddit, Snapchat, tinder, and anything else I came across. And like most accounts, I lost interest fairly quickly. I always liked Reddit, but didn't really engage with it, just scrolled. Then, like I said, I happened across it again while googling tutorials and guides. So I reinstalled it on my phone and have been on it pretty consistently since I don't play fallout everyday. It's kinda my way to check in. My name is pretty unique: Remington Dalke, or Rem for short. Google it. You'll find I'm legit and I'm an attorney. 
---
This may be a weird or random or insane post, but it's real. I just wanted people who had put their blood and tears into this game to know their work was appreciated. I know I would love to hear from my officers or my community that they appreciate all my hard work. That's it. 
---
Pretty much the same for me. If I‚Äôm set up near White Spring I‚Äôm usually near the driving range far enough from the clubhouse. 
---
I usually try to keep a float of 25-30 bulk everything in stash
---
You have to delete them in the games gallery not the ps4 gallery. Samething happened to me it took me awhile to figure it out lol
---
How do I access the in game gallery? 
---
I think it'd be cool if when you pinned it to the board you could choose what you're doing so players knew what they were joining and could filter by. Like PvP, Exploring, Quests, Launching a nuke, SBQ, etc
---
Savage divide map 4 just worked on this dig site
---
That could work, or maybe a craftable consumable item that takes some effort to complete
---
Ok well that's different than what OP did. OP halfway repeated the rest they were referring to and concluded that because one thing didn't change that other things didn't change.
---
That's why I called it a wild guess. It has zero impact on whether this theory is bullshit but OPs experiment was faulty.
---
Nah, I only recently bought the game to play with a friend who enjoys it. I have no stake in how many other people are playing it
---
I've seen 3 go off at once so I think it's good now, on xbox at least
---
Just make it available to all but a pain in the ass to get. You only really need it if your high level. By then you can find what you need to get it (even though a bitch to do)
---
Yeah that'd be pretty sick for sure.
---
In regards to purchasing ammo from a vendor, the ammo:cap ratio is pretty cheap for Fuel in comparison to other ammo types. Fuel is 1:2 where most are like 1:3 or 1:5/7/9. 
---
Agreed. I want another bar sign from the Atoms shop, but there's no point. My budget is maxed, without any defenses.
---
Bgs response: keys now weigh .1 pounds each. Still can't scrap or drop them lol

I called my whole family into my room to show them this today when I got home from work.  I was so excited.  And while my children just told me I was old and that they could read it fine, it still has made my day!
---
*Muertos Talones*
---
Nah, it works. I play ultrawide, it's fine. I'm assuming you found the thread over on /r/fallout about the ini edit declaration, that dude was 100% wrong about basically everything. It works fine.
---
hmmm we have a rdr2 player here lol is this Lumbago uncle we have here? LMAO :).
---
This is a problem across all of the Bethesda games that I have played. especially in the elder scrolls games, with all the crazy fonts. They need to add a zoom feature for notes. that would fix the problem for those of us who can't read it because it's too small, and those of us who can't read it because it's too light. 
---
I just go raiding u get plenty of everything that way
---
I'm online now if you still want to do this.  The reason you can't get on the bus is because you don't have the marsupial mutation (yet, probably).
---
Right on!!
---
I think a found a cap or two once. 
---
I found one cap during the beta. Once. 
---
:D thanks for answering though
---
Yeah... I'm not that old but not below 13 uhh I like the game and wish I had good stuff to enjoy the game
---
When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.

It's the same here really.   That's why I have the welcome home sign out by the door.

I only carry the Excavator and the T-60 with me. Bought the best mod plans for the T-60 from the BOS vendor and same for the excavator from the Camden park vendor. The T-60 is for nuke zones and places where I need a jet pack. Excavator for everything else (found a Tesla shock mod that makes quick work on any melee attacker).
---
Saving up violet flux for the increased carry limit on the excavator but otherwise I‚Äôve got everything I need...
---
what?
---
Have you considered finding a external hard drive? They aren't too expensive and doesn't require you to delve into your computer's insides
---
I‚Äôve never found a thing. I thought maybe there was a possibility a really rare RNG god that bestowed the most amazing item in the game  
---
I love that one of the items leaving the shop is a Tricentennial Edition themed hat. Something that maybe could have been included in the Tricentennial Edition...?
---
thanks!
---
Then don't be afraid to grab a water or a crop by the time they are back it's already there again :)
---
Have you tried turning it off and then back on again?
---
the game.
---
the xbox, whatever platform youre on?
---
if i am suffering from a few non game breaking bugs ill live with it. most times ill hop servers to solve 50% of bugs. 
---
reloading the games solves all the bugs... for like 5 mins then something breaks eventually
---
Interesting. Did you happen to run the test 5 pcs with no perks? I would be interested if at 5 pcs action boy is worthless
---
You didnt read the second edit did you?
---
They did do everything you guys wanted and still nothing happened. 
---
I did! Could you send me a screenshot? My purchase is contingent on it! Lol and with Bethesda not having the best refund policy, is hate to buy it and have it stretched to full screen.
---
Famous heh...awesome...
---
I‚Äôm going to hang on until 10:15 or so so hit me up when your on and we can know out the excavator shocks today and we will sort out the other stuff tomorrow if that cool!üëåüëå
---
only 2 - 3 people really.
---
Ox-horn good vids,
---
MATN is good for fallout content but not for FO76 as he didn't like it at launch so hasn't played a lot.
---
He did do a fallout 76 series a bit ago but not as good as his other stuff.
---
There isn't really any others but i do watch CapnNoob for his weapon testing on FO76 its not bad.
---
Right.
---
Last night after I finished the quest "Novice of Mysteries", I lost the sword of Bastet during that same server disconnection. It's very irritating because it was an unique sword and I can't have back, but  what's happened to you is 100^10 worse
---
Thanks please do.
---
I've got a few caps. I spent a few days searching all the ones I came across....for science. 
---
Thanks. 
---
It happened when I was pretty low level, it wasnt much like I said i think maybe 1-3 but its possible it came from another source since its never happened again for me. 
---
If things do drop it must be very rare because it's only been that one time out of many dozens of tries so even I'm doubting my memory. Lol.
---
Twice I found an individual cap on a petrified corpse. No telling how many I've searched. I still check them, for some reason.
---
Exactly. I built on the junk pile. 
---
Thanks
---
OMG time a wendingo jumped off a cliff after me and died. I'd call that a win.

That reddit name really suits the story

Of course.

Heck yeah.

Eh it was my first

Mini gun and .50 cal

In today‚Äôs society it‚Äôs strange to think some people still can wonder why people love ‚Äòvideo games‚Äô. I still get that question every once I a while like, ‚Äúhow can you play that for 3-4 hrs at a time?‚Äù My response is, how can you binge watch trash TV like the Batchelor or the Voice? I would much rather play FO76 then surf Netflix, Hulu, HBO etc for an hr just to find some mediocre series or movie I haven‚Äôt seen. I‚Äôm so much more engaged gaming. I‚Äôve said in previous posts, I‚Äôve prob done 6 playthrus on FO4 playing each faction as both a good and bad character. That game is a masterpiece IMHO. I did the same with Borderlands 2. When you find a great game, it‚Äôs better then practical any form of escape. Stay with it, if it works for you then be glad you found something that does.
---
Go for it. 
---
Nuke zones are open to all. I‚Äôve had sour interactions after one another. I just don‚Äôt do nuke zone anymore. Sans for a the few I‚Äôve done in previous week or so. 
---
My biggest is when no one wants to team or be nice. Like we all can get loot and whatnot.  More people make it more fun. If your the type to be selfish then wait for an empty server to nuke. 
---
It‚Äôs so annoying to get to a nuke zone and see everyone killing legendary mobs and you can get in hits to count you in the loot pool.  
---
I‚Äôve said it once and I‚Äôll say it again. Nuke zone should automatically team people up that aren‚Äôt teamed and make all mobs lootable to anyone that is in the nuke event. Barring anyone that doesn‚Äôt have the event quest. 
---
I would also like this. 
---
But what if being a dick IS what makes the game fun? I'm usually nice in game but sometimes I want to role-play a little.
---
Got any ammo for a newbie? Can give ya couple fusion cores
---
Having multiple copies of keys is now viewed as duping. Accounts banned accordingly 
---
If you hit store all junk button at your stash, mods go too.  Check your stash mod tab, they might be there.
---
It wasn't mine.  I've been camped out above the Whitespring station for 3 or 4 months now.  I wouldn't be surprised if someone copied my design after I posted it.
---
Giving stuff away is also a great way to make NEW friends. :)
---
'get out of my video game nuke zone' lmfao nerd detected
---
Warning given ahead of time to drop duped keys. No one removed duped keys. They were asking for a ban
---
Caps and scrap mostly. I got a quantum from one once. 
---
800 lbs of it.
---
Thanks, same to you.  I'm on pc.
---
Can confirm. Hunted those damn vents for weeks. Found it, installed. Realized I need two FML. Found it again. Frantically happy I installed and tested it. Barely seemed to do anything. If at all. I may have been delusional and trying to justify the lost effort. 
---
Wait what? 
---
I dunno, I've never even come close to actually using up my space. 
---
I have a queit CAMP under some powerlines; I have all the equipment I need, plus decor, and Im at like 60%
---
I recently hit level 112 and had to push my stats towards pvp instead of pve just for survivability. People are very hostile at higher levels. Not all but I would say 7/10 would sooner shoot at u than be nice. 
---
A lot of it was with workshops, people go take workshops from other people just to initiate pvp, full teams of people I‚Äôve seen roll up just for pvp, they don‚Äôt even want the workshop, they just want ur caps.
---
It doesn't necessarily crash, but subsequent nukes can slowly destabilize things.
---
Ok makes sense. Thanks for your help!
---
hang on, lemme fire it up real quick, lol
---
Had this happen with chameleon armor.  Take it off, reload, should be fixed.
---
Same, the noise does my head in.

Yes there are loading screens. Some take seconds to do and some take a hot minute. I guess it depends zone size or hardware. 
---
It's not just this game, for me, it's the same in all the most recents titles.
---
Hmm. Seems legit.
---
They could add it in a locked display case on some wall in the nuka factory...
---
Actually I haven't had any caffeine today, I just had a sudden burst of creativity.
---
Yeah, they're thirsty. Blood thirsty.
---
You dirty rat.
---
That's laziness on their part, since their ban waves proved that they can see what items you have had in your inventory. They are just being lazy on verifying your claim and spawning you a new one
---
It will scrap the current sights and apply the scope. You cant scrap a legendary effect.
---
Long as you didn't hear whistling, you shouldn't be alarmed. Negan trying to be a good guy now. 
---
You should definitely check r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Such friendly and helpful people changed my entire F076 experience 
---
Well that's not actually the case. Frames you enter automatically get recalled to your inventory 60 seconds after you climb out. Any frames you come across in the wouldn't have been used before since they would have been recalled by whoever had used them previously. You wouldn't even be able to collect the different sets and types of PA without multiple frames even with the now 800lb stash limit. I don't think that's even enough space to collect each individual piece of the different PA variations. Especially if you hadta switch individual pieces in and out of one single frame.

Man do I get that occasional need for an escape from life - you and I have travelled in similar occupational circles. I was an EMT then Police Officer/Sniper - and a dad with two kids - before I turned 25. We had good DA's, they'd come ride along sometimes. I got along well with the Public Defenders, too, which some cops didn't. I was always honest on the stand, so the PD's didn't give me a lot of trouble. After being an officer for several years, I thought I wanted to be an attorney, maybe a prosecutor... I even did a year of law school part time. But after spending a lot of time with lawyers, it didn't seem like a good long-term plan for me. But police work was starting to take a toll on me, so I knew it was time to find something else. I ended up getting a teaching credential and M.Ed. instead, and finished my career out as a teacher.
---
A few years ago I turned 50 and was able to retire from the teaching job, too. Since I had some extra time on my hands, I got back into gaming and discovered a great little escape... Fallout 4. Exploring the map, making decisions that don't have real-life lethal consequences, creating dwellings, farming... just enjoying the wasteland... it was great! Then came Fallout 76 and it was different.  Do I miss the storylines and NPC's in Fallout 4? Honestly yes, they were cool, but....
---
Fallout 76 let's me game with my now adult sons! A chance to hear their voices and laughter like they're nearby, when they both live thousands of miles away. My older boy attends college on the GI Bill (an Army vet that served in the Afghan War), and my younger boy is active duty military (he does field IT for a combat troop, so he's wifi enabled). Sure, we can always call each other... yawn. But with Fallout 76 we can play and laugh and share an experience in the wasteland together like we all live right around the corner from each other - and that's amazing!
---
I've been a young dad to kids and I treasured the occasional escape from their shrill little voices, lol. Now I get to escape WITH them and their booming adult voices. It's the best... I suspect you will find out someday.
---
Those guys were just jackasses. I'm level 108ish and run nuke zones all the time. You run into that sometimes, but mostly PVP stuff doesn't crop up in Whitesprings as much as it does at Prime. At Prime, those guys wait until you kill the queen and then try and gank you to steal your stable flux. Even then, it doesn't happen all that often. You just keep tagging and sharing the kills at Whitesprings. You're doing it right. No one owns a nuke zone. 
---
I'm 107 now, but even in my 50s i was doing that. Whenever I have a ridiculously full stash box or a bunch of lower level legendaries from i don't even know where, i look around the map for you guys. For us, its junk. For you, holy crap! 100 screws???
---
I also find its hard being larger and getting 20-30s to trust you have good intentions. I've built dozens of fusion generators, water purifiers, base defenses and so on. Shown how to wire things and lock everything up. Sometimes my play group will join in the action. 
---
But for every 2 of us theres that 1 dick that will destroy everything you own and laugh at you doing it.
---
One time i guided some player to the place we get the excavator. On the way there, "she" wanted to do a quest. She killed Evan and validated the quest for me too. I would have prefered not to kill it, because the Overseer say to leave him alone, but it seems to be the only way...
---
My personal experience.  I‚Äôm lvl 125. I repeat the same routine on login. I go to vendors. Sell shit to get weight down, find a quest, or unexplored area, kill shit, take shit. Return to camp. Repeat. 
---
BUT, I‚Äôve since started respec‚Äôin and changing my build. Adventuring without PA, add different mutations, use different guns, or only a knife. Going out without stim packs or any armor. Etc. 
---
I changed my build a few months ago and added Marsupial, which was cool. Then later added a jet pack which never gets old for me. Last week I bought the chameleon mutation and got weightless armor, and now just sneak around invisible. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not repetitive, but you can extend your fun. 
---
Ya f that guy
---
There are also other civil war war weapons you could use. Gatling, lever rifle, and some of the pistols too
---
OK! Here is a little album
---
https://imgur.com/a/UfWDHky
---
If you can't read the notes on there, the only one that really has any issues is the map, it snaps on the left and right to the standard widescreen res and you can see whatever you're looking at when you paused behind it, but that's the only issue I could find. That said there's some glitch where my atom shop items aren't loading their textures (probably because of whatever I did to fix it last time this happened during one of the funky patches), so my pip boy was just a glob of hot pink, but the display of that is fine as well, lol. If I can get that texture thing fixed I'll add screenshots of that to the album. I think MAYBE the text on the trade window might be stretched a little bit on the very bottom where it says "space sell item, x inspect, etc" but I'm not 100% sure. Everything else is fine, lol.
---
A lot more buildings are part of the open world area compared to 4
---
Okay, I think you should make your character look like Jimmy Stewart. In ‚ÄúThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance‚Äù  he played the fearless lawyer trying to bring justice to the untamed West. 
---
I check and the lever rifle doesn't count. But thank you.
---
BoS really know how to rock.
---
You can summon them in the command center at whitespring.
---
Because I, personally, don't want an alert everytime a mole rat gnaws on my walls
---
People are free to play the game however they please.
---
You know, I'm sorry, but shit happens.  In 80 hours I've had a couple crashes.  In 700 hours, you've probably had a few more.  Sometimes we lose stuff.  The vast majority of the time, we don't.
---
But at the end of the day you got 700 hours of entertainment at whatever cost you paid for FO76, and you lost a few digital numbers extra damage due to an imperfect creation, as all things made by Man will be, forever.  Big fuckin deal.  
---
I find radiation every time, but otherwise, nothing.  
---
The loot is a lie.
---
Just realized the character from the book I‚Äôm reading is Mort (deaths apprentice) did not realize why the author chose that name till now lol
---
Yessssss!
---
Ha! Great catch..
---
Lol. yeah, I only ever find the glowing green soup. 
---
Wow... Dude those look great! I am used to some games having menus and stuff 16.9 thats not a huge deal. I was mostly concered about the HUD but that fits nice! Yeah, the trade menu text looks a tad squished, nothing too major though. The main menu fits well, HUD looks sweet... I think that may have done it! 
---
I really appreciate you taking the time dude. I have the most hours in the FO franchise starting from Fallout 2. So  literally 1000s of hours in all of them with modding and such over the years. With FO4, having to add a mod for UW support was frustrating, so this is a big breath of fresh air. 
---
Thank you! 
---
You do know that the .50 is less damage and a rarer ammo, right?
---
It‚Äôs so stupid, it‚Äôs practically a meme,  but there it is.

Fast way I buying them but springs suger grove (clipboards) Screws monogroh power plant outside tents (typewriters) Charleston herold (also typewriters) aluminium watago robots

This is a great idea.

That just hurts to read

Hope you don‚Äôt mind but I‚Äôve set my C.A.M.P. there. Thanks.

Do the safety dance.
---
Who wants to pass up all that free radiation?

As appropriate for one of those walking death lizards.

Well on the off chance I join your server I‚Äôll just go check out your build as long as I can use the workbenches üëçüèª

7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

Level 72 here and did the house last night and Jesus I had 2 scorchbeasts, a shed load of scorched and then when I got the ten pumpkins and was heading back to Jack,,I got ambushed by 4 supermutants with mini guns lol 3 were going overlord lol
---
Nice job! Great framing, action, beast, colors.... I'll use it.
---
Think 3 is overkill on the same toon? I mean - sure, it kinda is. I‚Äôd rather stack multiple Blade of Bastet, but those are harder to trade for and I have NO IDEA how multiple of those will work when repairing / upgrading.
---
How bad is it to remove the heavy from the All Rise do you think? 2 pounds is nice.
---
I have no friends that play games and i very really fast even though FO76 curred me of my hording habits. I only fast travel if it's under 10 cap because i'm so poor in this game. And now they ajusted prices of plans, i won't see the end of it.
---
I haven't been able to apply marsupial I've tried 3 times now I drink it and I get the suppressed negative effects but I never get the actual effect
---
OP, sorry to say it but you're the latest in a long and distinguished list of people who've had items disappear. I posted about this 3 weeks ago and many did so well before me. Good news is BGS is aware of the concerns; bad news is no idea what the plan is to address. They did note it would take some time to investigate. Seems to me automated restoral tools (to address your issue) and the ability to lock items (to prevent unintended dropping, scrapping, trading or selling) would solve this.

&gt;I've been able to take out some enemies in one shit (sneaking of course

I would play this \^ game.
---
Thanks. I go through so much aluminum, never even thougut to farm robots.

Just started exploring it... It's absolutely awesome &amp; horrifying...jump scares galore...mireluck kings ghouls &amp; the fuckin. Wendingo lol makes for a great way to pass the time before going to sleep...get a buzz on + this whole game = amazing fuckin night dude... 
---
side note
---
Would you have a layout of the cave or know if there is one or if it's just a you'll figure it out type of scenario? 
---
With our without the mod do you think? 8 pounds vs 2 ... my rifle character is already strapped on weight.
---
Don‚Äôt.  Just don‚Äôt.
---
If they think that they can monetize pay to just fing play , they will.
---
We need basic shit fixed, not being upsold to us.  I‚Äôd def quit if I saw that shit happen.
---
They generally scale to the higher level player. But there are areas like The Forest where enemies are level capped. 
---
Steel lead aluminium and circuits for vend runs 
---
Do note the salvaged Assaultron heads do not auto scrap and must manual be broke down. They weight 8lb each
---
2 things. Did you own a workshop? If so...not grieving, secondly was name of the guy Tacocatracecar?
---
I would just love a key ring, that all keys were filed under
---
Doesn't mean they aren't assholes.
---
No problem! One piece of input I'll give that I didn't realize until I started another character, the early "it's a tutorial on how to play the game" part is a little slow, but once you get in to the game, it's a bit less "chore-like" if that makes any sense. There's a bunch of early quests that are just "go here get water, go here cook thing" and that kind of stuff. Other than that, I've had fun with the ~175-200 hours I have in it. 
---
I thought that was what the siren was for? (Clearly, I've never installed one...)
---
But perhaps that would be a good use for it?
---
yOU waNNA HAve A WalL PapER ofF NOw dO yA? Hold my beer.

(will edit later once i get some shots) 
---
Yeah but then peeps will open paint shops and Bethesda will lose atom sales.
---
Hense why we can't
---
Thanks man! Just keep on being nice.
---
Very nice.  Is there a lead source there?
---
I just got a warning yesterday on Xbox.  First one ever.
---
Deathius Clawius?
---
To me it seems the last player to enter an area sets the enemy spawn level.
---
Right, but I wouldn't equate 1 fuel to one ammo. Also, there's no need to buy normal ammo from a vendor 
---
You can normally buy a basic dragon from the vendor in watoga. I've come across a few legendaries and just sold one today. Are you on PS4? If so, I can keep you in mind when I come across another.
---
The vast majority of the player-base wouldn't be organized enough to make paint-shops an option for the average single player. If it got the point where paint-shops were everywhere Bethesda would probably do more Atom shop sales than they are right now (I see very few people with anything other than excavator pa, a floating wood house, and an axe/gauntlet/sledge).
---
Yeah I figured as much. I had my fair share of open world/rpg style games that have pretty boring/stale introductions! 
---
Thanks again!
---
I just had a junkies one drop like five minutes ago üò∂ but I‚Äôm a melee mostly type. If you have some tempting melee weapons and/or ballistic fiber on PC I‚Äôd be happy to swap you. I thought it was a cool gun but it won‚Äôt see much use by me. 
---
Which system? This ridiculousness does not happen on PS4 
---
&gt;How on earth is  "shit happens" even a remotely acceptable business practice, mush less an acceptable user experience?  No need to answer, your post kinda says it all. A unique mind.. indeed.

No no that‚Äôs the death claws cousin.....also a related to the Dillsburg Snow Raptor [link here](https://www.sciencetells.co.uk/2019/03/06/spotted-some-interesting-tracks-in-the-snow-tonight-dillsburgsnowraptor-in-dillsburg-pa/)

If u craft guns there's never enough lol

Lol
---
Yeah u have to keep scrapping that gun
---
I haven't noticed.  Play for a few hours every day on PS4 without any noticeable lag.
---
would agree if they would be playing alone.
---
The bethesda.net website is down right now on their end. Thanks for compiling the list from the page.
---
lemme at 'em
---
Disney would put their films in the vault for an extended amount of time. Which meant you wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy your movie until it was released again. It‚Äôs simply a way of saying buy it now if you want it because it won‚Äôt be available later.
---
Thanks, yes, vault tec u. Gym in the basement vault with weights. 
---
Both are Endurance Perks!
---
Vaccinated (protection from creatures) works fine but DONT protect us from these 2 radiation diseases because i got the radworms often from ghouls!
---
Natural Resistance (protection from environment) same as Vaccinated, works but didnt protect us from these 2 radiation diseases because i got rad worms from ghouls and the pustules from radiation zones with both perks active AND a wearing a power armor!
---
Its more along the lines of CS is outsourced or low wage and they don't want to give them access to tools like this which could potentially be abused or cause far more harm than they fix if improperly used.
---
Just tested 3 times and it averaged 5.02
---
Server hop watoga vendor..it will take at most 3 tries
---
Its bethesda's shot i just edited it. 
---
That is the purpose of the Siren, isnt it?
---
Sadly yes, was hoping to protect my self from any disease because of my PA Bloody Build to get tough as possible but the game says NO -,-
---
Yeah, all ammo is very overpriced and never worth it (except for fuel but even then its a sacrifice). 
---
Yeah, no.
---
This was made by Bethesda and they've been using it since before the game even launched. It was one of their first teaser pictures for the excavator armor.
---
Lame, dude.
---
What console are you on? I have plenty of extra I could spare. Probably not enough for the whole set. But i overhoard and don't like throwing it out.
---
X box one.

I'm right there with you....

All that appears at the end in bold italic is "be sure to drink your ovaltine".
---
Do you have carnivore/herbivore?
---
I love this idea! You could have different types of matches; looting, kill - centric, exploring, etc.. maybe even a mode where the game tells you what events to do; too often, when I hang with a rando, we each want the other to decide what to do. So we end up hanging around at camp until one of us leaves to do our own thing. Wow... I just realized that I'm even boring in video games.
---
I tried that the other day. A guy and his friend started shooting me and wouldn't stop. I had to log at 50% health, was so annoying. 
---
Thanks for the tests. I really appreciate it.
---
I'm also a random-inviter.  I understand that this rubs some folks the wrong way (and if I had to guess, it's folks who come from first-wave MMOs where that behavior \_was\_ considered rude).  But in a game with no matchmaking system and a 24-person shard?  You bet your ass I'll throw out a few random invites to similarly- or lower-leveled players and share the Inspirational card. :D
---
...But yeah, about 10% acceptance rate.

Stop seeking revenge on people with bounties you rockhead
---
It happens to me whenever i fast travel to Harpers Ferry in Power Armor if you want to re-create it. I have figured out a way to prevent this is to fast travel in sneak. So far ive never had it happen. 
---
It happens when i teleport into my base though, which happens to spawn me under rocks sometimes. I guess it bugs out. I use third person though i dunno if that makes a difference. 
---
I made this exact same thread 2 days ago.

Well that was \*unexpected\*
---
I'll try the sharpness adjustment but I don't know if anyone has the problem I have. On my tv the writing on notes have a white outline which makes it extremely difficult. Occasionally I'll see notes with bold legible writing and then it completely loads and I'm back to the outline. 
---
Thank you for starting it all. 
---
Saw a rando lvl 28 at a train station, one of the rare times I had my headphones in outside of a party.
---
Told the guy I'm a medic and saw his health was just below full.
---
So I gave him 40 stimpaks.  A ‚ù§ and üëç later I continued on my vendor route selling straightjackets to robots.
---
Then be a dick to the other in-game dicks. The takeaway from that is in single player games, you can be a dick to the Preston Garvey's all you want and it affects no one (it only makes you happy). In a multiplayer game, real people are out there creating their own experiences. It's just not right to adversely interfere with that.
---
I get it. Sometimes you just want to screw with people. I'm really hoping that the new PvP servers will allow people to do just that, but with other like-minded people. 
---
You're gonna want to hit up Watoga and the Whitespring Bunker. The bots in Watoga drop aluminum, steel and lead. The emergency medical center, on top of housing the occasional legendary also has a number of surgical trays and aluminum cans. Also Phoenix's SD Mart generally holds fans and hot plates for screws. 
---
After Watoga, head to the Whitespring bunker and grab just about everything. The medical bay has aluminum surgical trays and the military wing has desks filled with office fans (screws) and clipboards (springs). There's also a number of coffee pots, hot plates and globes all around the bunker.
---
I also have the issue at my base. I'll try Harpers Ferry in PA with sneak on and off.
---
I played the whole game this way and I'm presently just about to hit level 180. I embrace it I always have what I need I run plenty fast enough to get anywhere fast travel he is highly overrated and by now I figured out all the shortcuts to get places so it's really not that long.
---
I actually only keep a select amount of junk in my stash but I run around in t60 armor with calibrated shocks a bunch of weight reduction perks and usually average about 1,300 lb when I'm heading out.
---
My stash is mostly full of 3-star legendaries that I may or may not have a purpose for in the future or find somebody who needs for their build. 
---
Overall it's pretty awesome. I almost never die because there's always plenty of stuff to keep me alive. When I run into somebody who needs springs/adhesive/aluminum, here have a hundred of whatever you need. I carry a Zealots .50 Cal, instigating fire axe, all rise, explosive light machine gun, ts shotgun, auto handmade and have every rank of most perks so I can mix and match as needed for whatever  weapons. I also carry two alternate power armors on me (x-01 and excavator) and one set of each other type in my stash.
---
I used to think at some point I would strip down but I'm really enjoying my play style.
---
Absolutely agree, couldn't even read the feedback forms in the nukacola plant, way way WAAAY too small text on a way to dark and dirty piece of paper.

Do you also offer a service to help people beg Bethesda for account reinstatement?

Lol...

Has he tried using 4 pieces of ‚Äúharder to detect‚Äù?

Tis free!

Where is this steam I wanna see

I would have had a heart attack! lol  
---
I've recently had a couple of nice encounters on my secondary character. I was level 6 and made a nice little tree house in Flatwoods and had a couple of visitors a few minutes apart. One made me a full lv 5 leather set with my armor bench and gave me a combat shotty and another gave me like 10 plans for all sorts of things, some I don't even have on my lv 52 main! lol   
---
Although, my husband claims they were only nice because of my new characters name, Cherry Bomb. lol 
---
No that's a different guy

Fast action by mods! :)

 Nothing good about those dudes

I‚Äôll catch up with you tomorrow maybe if you can get on 7-9 ( Ohio time lol) I got your caps on decküëä
---
Do you have any proof of this? Currently, it sounds like a scam.
---
Tales from Appalacia was how I found Filthy Casuals.  Glad you like it!
---
I would bet money that unused space makes little to no difference.
---
Looking at the budget costs of different items, I'm pretty sure cost is primarily based on computational expense with a side of game balance.  Static objects (e.g., walls) are cheap, animated objects and lights are more expensive, and objects with AI like turrets are more expensive still.  Empty space mostly doesn't cost computation time.
---
Some of the limitation is probably server computation to boot, which would limit budget expansion even on powerful client platforms.
---
It sucks, and it would be great if they found a way to expand them, but I understand why the limits exist.
---
Noodie is right. You have nothing to worry about
---
No he just uses chameleon and Stand Fast. But the Stand Fast is Harder to Detect right?
---
Ditto. 
---
Yup. I sit 8 feet from a 60" TV. I have to stand up and get within 4' to read some of the material.
---
I'm 48 years old and had trouble reading Fallout's screen two decades ago... so, nostalgia, I guess? ;\^)
---
Tried it yeah, and it doesn't work.  I'm going to have to scrap this character because Bethesda TS said they couldn't do anything about it.  Thankfully its only like level 10 or so.  
---
I think perfect storm counts as an automatic pistol, but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
It is not a scam I play on xbox. It has just been kept under the radar. Where do u think all these weps and armor come from. I could send u a pic of my inventory 
---
I think my point went over your head 
---
Sounds like they just wanted to be assholes. I'd say nuke zones are free for all zones.
---
What else is free?
---
Interesting. Thank you. I haven't been on FO76 in awhile since I had to move away from hubby for a bit to sort out my dad's estate after he passed. He's got the "home Xbox" so whenever free stuff from the atom shop is posted here that I want, I have to ask him to get on my account and get it for me. 
---
ESO does this and it's actually really fucking predatory. They price the skins at $40 dollars apiece because they know crafters will buy it. They would make more money off of crafters having skins available than people buying them individually
---
Thanks!  Great explanation.

I got a friend that gets griefed all the time even though his missile turrets are all hooked up to a switch and powered off whenever players go to the golf club or he leaves his camp.
---
There's a bunch of servers, but only one camp for that player.  Instead of server hopping as you already were, you destroy their one camp.
---
Why is that okay in this case?
---
What kind of milk we talkin bout here?
---
There were low level players there that's why
---
price is floating between 5-9k so you should get a bit more :) 
---
Throw it off your roof
---
If you have it unlocked yeah
---
Yeah but maybe it stacks like chameleon. So you could be nearly impossible to detect without being invisible. 
---
Is it for specific guns? I believe I unlocked everything 
---
Different situation, obnoxious, don't blame you for trying to have a fluid game experience.
---
It's why everyone got so tired of nuke runs so fast. Actually gathering the codes and decrypting was supposed to be an adventure in itself, rather than just a 20 minute run through the silos with the code from online.
---
I‚Äôll leave the door unlocked. 
---
I took run the inspiration card or the cap selling one. People really like that one. 
---
Hahaha I posted this 100+ days ago, that‚Äôs crazy. Yeah, I found out ab the skull mask and virtually went directly from the Vault to the Pumpkin house and I got my shit wrecked
---
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
---
Get a clue.
---
 Its resting. It will be OK. ;)
---
Rare ammo? You mean the stuff people can craft, 180 at a time?
---
It comes in two colors: Wasteland Chic, and Rust ‚Äòn Ready.
---
Some mods if a very low chance of unlocking when you scrap, even if you know every other mod of the specific gun.
---
No problem. Depending on how long since you've played the game has improved a great deal and you might be very pleasantly surprised when you finally get an opportunity to get back into it.
---
You found an automatic Radium? Huh? Do those even exist in FO76?
---
Ah, I like being in the centre of the action, I'm one of the guys that you see smacking the SBQ with a sledgehammer each time she's grounded. Certainly blow through the stimpacks playing this way, but hey, gotta have fun 
---
So I am on now. Have space suit from the station. All it states in the description is spacesuit. Not clean or dirty or worn. Just spacesuit.
---
I‚Äôll buy it rn psn steelerwins
---
Oh so you're one of those born in the 1960's sociopaths.
---
It all makes sense now...  It's sad how people enjoy hurting others, guess we'll just laugh about it at someone's expense and get reddit validation to make it all seem okay.
---
Because that's what makes the world go round these days it seems.

This isn‚Äôt going to be cover by Vault-Tec C.A.M.P insurance is it?

This is the sort of person I would want to play with.

Printed receiver???
---
Really?
---
Sorry 
---
Primed i meant
---
Game has already been data dumped. I don't know what more evidence you need that this ending doesn't exist, but alright. Wait for even more videos I guess
---
I once accidentally threw a plasma grenade at the blue suitcase in watoga station because the transfer button was grayed out from what I assume was server lag and I habitually mash R1 to scroll through tabs to notes.
---
I literally took out over 50% of a players health because of it.  I hearted him and felt so shitty, tried to give him stimpaks as an apology but he just taunted me then ran into watoga.
---
I'm still sorry random guy.  I didn't mean to plasma grenade you :(
---
I don't know of any community, but I'm a fairly active player and would be interesting in helping create one. I active craft level 20 heavy studded leather armor w pocketed limbs for lower level players. 
---
I run a support gunner, and pseudo medic build. 
---
But did he make pasta before leaving?
---
You need the plan for it. Scorched Beasts can drop prime receiver plans, so you'll need to farm the bats or try your luck in the market.

Melee is what I've encountered and so have most people  I play with.  I'm sure it applies to range builds, but I've never been invaded by a ranged character. It 's always melee with some kind of gauntlet.  Some goes for people  I play with. 
---
I've seen at least 10 different comments by people saying the vendor comes out in a week. It's like you didnt read my post at all.
---
I love this game.
---
I play on PC.
---
I have a 43" 4K Monitor.
---
I sit about 2 feet away.
---
I can read just fine.
---
:P

(long live the master race)
---
I love when she lands! Even her level 80 children. Its good fun running across the field and power smashing her ugly face with my furious sledge! 
---
State Farm can handle that bat 
---
the dead giveaway is the pip boy restarting on 10/23 every time. Time can only progress for as long as you can maintain active progress within a server

Make sure you keep that pacifist mode on and hold hands with everyone who ruins the experience for everyone else.  Get a job, hippie!

The only solution is nuking your house to send it back
---
I'm not fixing that misspelling lmfao
---
If someone kills you twice and steals your junk they're just playing the game. They're playing the PvP part of the game, but that's it. If you want to take it as malicious, that's your choice not our reality
---
Sounds good.  What‚Äôs your GT?
---
Shit I would have bought them for 150 lmao 
---
Or someone who knows it can make it for you... are you on PC?
---
Yeah, but in a different way for me...
---
I had a nice camp on the water, east of Top of the World. Acid extractor going, brahmin always spawn in, waterfall in my back yard. It was quiet. Nothing really bothered me, except for the fact that 60% of the time i loaded the game i couldn't place my camp. 
---
I loved that spot. Always had ribeye on the bbq. Try a Different World worked all right, my new world was moving the damn camp to a new spot. No more extractors (useless anyways post nerfs). Now eagerly await someone to launch at Alpha so i can watch it from my 3rd story balcony:)
---
Only close friends get to use my first name sir
---
Well put and yes, I look forward to trying out the Survival servers.
---
I ran a tribe called The Saviors on an unofficial Ark Survival server, we had about a dozen people and we basically were the server police, whenever we had trolls join the server we just knocked them out and locked them in a cave.
---
Last time someone offered to show me there inventory I got butt raped. I wouldn't take this guy up on his offer. You might also get butt raped.
---
Only logical choice really.
---
All the time in Watoga. It‚Äôs easy to spot them in the tubes. 
---
put a smile on my face :) nice pic!
---
Oh I‚Äôve got a melee build or two - but they are rocking furious / PA melee (or executioner / PA). My guass needs to smack things on occasion, that‚Äôs my thought for the All Rise. Just wondering how many I should keep on hand, and if I should remove the rocket to save 6 pounds each.
---
Usually that toon will be shooting w/ the gauss, but sometimes you get swarmed and if I‚Äôm in PA (say a nuke zone) I‚Äôll have plenty of action points and can power attack.
---
I managed to stay there for a week before I gave up. Constantly server hopping when the game crashed or even just loading in the first time. I couldnt care about the acid, that was just a bonus. I miss the 3 brahmin and the random 3x spawn at the trail near the end of the pond. Sometimes fox, sometimes molerats, never knew what was for lunch.
---
I have a theory that if you kill the SBQ at exactly midnight on the 5th of may, you unlock Sombra.
---
What‚Äôs a GT?
---
No what. I didnt claim the image. Just editied it. 
---
Farm the Queen, you'll get them eventually :V
---
What is a GT?
---
Is stream sniping strictly prohibited or something?
---
I always assumed it was something frowned upon but not prohibited. Especially when their teammate initiated the fight.
---
The jet will make ya jittery! 
---
Sounds like you bought the wrong game.
---
I had some pretty bad lag on the weekend... It  was taking me several minutes to load into Whitesprings, and the Ghouls where invisible for a few minutes too... Although there some weather happening where I am so I assumed it was that.
---
I had really bad lag on the PS4 servers tonight. Also, any 3 star legendary I was fighting would lag/disappear and then reset. Pretty frustrating.
---
Or make it increase your speed for a few minutes.
---
GamerTag, or your username on Xbox live
---
It's not what I wanted and no, I didn't read the edit because that was after my initial post on the matter.
---
And drop your hunger while under the effect. 
---
There's not enough information here. I run my rifleman with 2 points in strength. I'm not sure what your build has. 
---
Xbox, and it is Endmin1. 
---
If I choose to join a different world there's a 90% chance I'll be at an eternal load screen. 
---
Yes well he seems to think so. I have 4 out of 5 pieces right now, so I'll have to test it out for myself.
---
I'll keep an eye out, what side of the world are you?
---
No problem! :D
---
A shotgun with 3 primary effects?
---
Thank you for hunting deathclaws and not cats :)
---
Wow this sounds easier than I thought it was gonna be.
---
Ps4
---
God I wish someone warned me about this before joining reddit...  Fairly toxic groups really do drown out the decent ones.
---
As an FYI......
---
I found with the automatic pipe pistol with a rifle stock that the tweaked receiver benefits from non automatic Rifleman perks.
---
There's a lot of mods that these glitches happen with, most likely typos and not glitches. 
---
Yeah. I've seen that on some other legendary enemies too like super mutants. It is a cool effect.
---
On the TSE combat shotgun you‚Äôre talking about antiarmor is a modification to the magazine. Not a legendary part of it. 
---
Personally, I value weapons with 90% reduced weight more.
---
Pump action does more damage. Combat shotgun has a bigger clip and fires faster
---
That 15 bulk seems like a lot, I usually keep it at 5 and still seem to have stash weight issues. I do hold on to 5 power armors and a lot of Legendary gear that I still want to experiment with though.
---
I wish your stash would give a categorical break down of weight used, it would be nice to see what's eating the most weight to help determine if you need to stop hoarding something.
---
Thank you for this.
---
I'm fine with dumping any legendaries for new players I come across. Since I'd just sell any trash legendary to vendors for next to nothing anyway. 
---
I keep 2 identical Furious Sledges on me at all times, both modded with the sharp heated rocket mod. Burns and bleeds while building damage too! Since i repair to 200% and my build and PA help me regen AP pretty good, i don't carry many guns with me besides my TSE Shotgun and TSE Handmade. 1 of those sledges will easily take me through alpha with a partner and a few laps of whitesprings before i even need to think about repairing it or pulling out the backup. I also have a furious Assaultron blade modded with electric shock just in case.
---
I'm on x box unfortunately. 
---
Thy gnome gods bless thee with prosperity!
---
Just watch out for the teddy bear god.
---
Its okay. Thanks though!
---
There was very little love shown for it in FO4 as well... until a certain someone [that lurks in this sub as well]  took matters in his own hands and gave raider PA - and the faction as a whole - overhauled the whole faction providing some much needed variety and customisation.
---
Then another modder took it further and created actual raider art, not just heads on spikes, to decorate one's settlements with.
---
I hope that Beth does something similar for FO76 down the line.
---
Events in the mire only
---
Just Bethesda being scummy. No reason to remove stuff other than scaring people into buying shit that may or may not come back out again.
---
Nice, maybe I‚Äôll come visit one of these days.  Mine is BenevolentDM 
---
I wish I had your patience.  If we didn't drop junk on death I'd be an overencumbered vendor walking between Flatwoods, Whitesprings, and Watoga Station selling stuff for stupid cheap just to buff people's experience in this game.
---
Saw him earlier today in Flatwoods. He spawned in on the bridge by the Vault Tec Agriculture Center. First time I've seen him in weeks.
---
It is dropped through a quest reward. The quest is called idle explosives and it‚Äôs a daily one. It is given to you in the more region at the location: Southern Belle Hotel
---
That's incredible. Never get ** or *** at whitesprings. Any perks you running that mighht make better legendary drops?
---
So it‚Äôs in the same loot table as the Traveling Leather Coat?
---
Trading 2 TSE pumps for a Anti armor Combat is not worth it unless the combat is anti armor explosive 
---
Majority of legendary enemies glow like that, it‚Äôs normal 
---
Yes ! Love the idea, im typically 1 player, but I'm currently stuck in the main quest needing to level up. If I could team up for a session I'd love to redo/assist on a lower level quest for a day!
---
First they tell players to break their game early, then ban the players who did.
---
Then they stream their own game and fail at it then threaten you with repercussions.
---
This company needs counseling.
---
On that note, anyone on PS4 under lvl35...let's play. DM me
---
You did nothing wrong, you pay the same amount to play the game they do. I wish it happened to me, I would have jumped at the chance of pvp. Most of the time I get bounties just for the chance of pvp. Its alot more rare than nuke zones.
---
Bulk = 10
---
What is a Akiwhachamacit
---
Incredibly bold to speak of doing so. If I recall wasn‚Äôt someone banned from going into areas not meant to be gotten into?
---
Gettin ready to open up a mothman bar come the 12th
---
Healing, marsupial, speed demon, scaly skin please
---
Certainly could happen, but I‚Äôve been in servers multiple times that had more than 1 Nuke zone going, sometimes overlapping areas, and it didn‚Äôt seem to have much effect (though flora didn‚Äôt seem to respawn as new nuked flora)
---
I got one from heart of the swamp event.
---
Preach brother. I lurk in here for good posts like this. You aren't the only one. 
---
Now you have me thinking about starting up a boxing league. XboxGT: Celticcrossbone if you want to join. Each member puts up an item to fight. Ref holds onto the items. Winner takes all. No Chem. Bare first only. Stay in the ring. Time to update my camp to accommodate fighters and fans :)
---
Not that I'm aware of? I didn't even know perks changed that sort of thing?
---
Really? Thought it was just for looks never bothered wasting the camp space for it. Going g to set one up now.
---
that was the developer room, this is a glitch when you do a horde event it puts you down there sometimes so not intentional they wouldn't and haven't banned for that.
---
Yeah movement speed increases like speed demon.
---
Dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You on ps4? I have something for ya
---
yep i didnt know it was possible.

Seriously, tf is wrong with people.

---
I found one in the watoga medical services building. 
---
I like the sound of the .50
---
Too bad you're on pc, i have a Hunters Hunting Rifle (30% to animals) w/ explosive modded to .50 for the boom. Its been sitting in my chest for a month now...
---
Pretty sure that wasn't there when i posted.
---
Stopped reading at edit 1 because he saif he didnt finish and he accepted that.
---
Oh need what you are saying. Lol! Ouch whatcha get? 
---
AP increase is what it did in FO:NV I think. 
---
We should at least be able to trade it with anyone who already has the skin unlocked. 
---
Ive gotten it before, but not consistently. When I did, I had actual items (walls, generators, etc) destroyed. So maybe it only pops up when part of your camp is fully destroyed?
---
question, do interior instances and exterior "cells" use the same server? you could dedicate one server for the exterior and another one for the interiors, so it would be way easy to be able to dedicate some more resources into the budget space.
---
But, of course this would require more servers 
---
Yep does not even have to be two shot. Vats is still broken. Only time it's better than aiming is for crits and flying things or fast target acquisition. 
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Jet hasn‚Äôt been invented yet.
---
no reason to bulk, since I'm not selling and there's no weight reduction
---
correct me if i'm wrong, but i think Jet hasn't been invented yet. 
---
Talones = heels :P

how about one fiddy

I have all except scaly that ones tough to make PSN?

Every legendary glows like that for about 10 seconds after it Spawns. Usually you don‚Äôt see it spawn is why you just noticed

That's the dirty one, the clean variant is named "Clean Spacesuit."

Or at least the helmet is.
---
not if i run into you while youre punching  the crap out of something, initiating pvp, then running to a safe distance and taking you out like a floating duck. well played fool. the game has not changed one bit lmao
---
The playtime paints, not a fan.
---
Once in a blue moon I get some junk item from a petrified corpse.. and as for underwater, nothing yet, although i got a 3 star armor that had ability to breath underwater tacked on.. haven't used it since all the water is basically a slow death
---
what's your gt? i'll keep an eye out for you
---
I use the .50 Cal ... With the correct build/perks/legendary it's unstoppable. Ammo is easy if you're planning for it. People that shit on heavy weapons aren't using them correctly (I know how that sounds and I'm sorry to say it but it's true), and have never massacred the golf club in 30 seconds flat :)
---
I‚Äôve got a shit ton of materials I can give you if your still on
---
I guess more so wondering like if 3 people are simultaneously holding at the keypad and confirm location at same time...?
---
Yes.  I have it for the hunting rifle.   Know this because I just got a TSE hunting rifle drop and was modding it the other night.   I might have it for other weps but I would have to log in and check.

what are you talking about, she literally begs you to kill him.

Well I‚Äôm sorry for that üò¨ GT BeardedOne13

2 zones may still be active now
---
Simple, I have friends to play with and don't take my loneliness out on random people behind a screen because I'm content enough with cooperative pve that I don't need to ruin random people's experiences to have fun.
---
No logic needed, it's common sense.  Cooperatively we all flourish, the other choice leaves a fraction of the diversity AND locks you into a continually manipulative power play scheme.  Have you not watched Mad Max??
---
Is it night or recon I'm speaking about night vision
---
Nice, we just launched one right after someone else did about 20 minutes ago on my server. Gonna try the three at once tomorrow maybe. 
---
Nooooooo!!! The plague of the Dungeon Finder returns..!
---
Am I seriously the only one who saw that was the beginning of the end for WoW?
---
Removing the need to engage friends to play with, will erode further the need for social behaviour and cause a chain reaction that will unravel the very fabric of the universe... Or you might pass out. 
---
Ehem. With less reason to be social and cultivate relationships on-/offline, players will be less social / more antisocial. 
---
Bethesda, please don‚Äôt go there. 
---
Yep... Talon is Spanish for Heel.
---
I didn't look closely at the helmet. But it didn't state anything in it's description along those lines either. Does the "clean" have better stats?
---
I remember doing this same thing on F3 and NV xD

Some In case anybody is interested \^\^

Other than that I don't know.

These drop somewhat often for me at Whit Springs.  Just got a One Shot Explosive dragon this past weekend.  Haven‚Äôt played with it yet and it does 400 damage.  I don‚Äôt remember if I had all of the rifle perks applied or not when looking at it. 
---
I generally don't attack people in the zones, but don't run with pacifist either. 
---
If I get the notification a teammate has been attacked though, better get ready cause I'm gonna break stuff. Last guy that attacked a teammate (who was much lower level than the attacker) earned a broken PA arm for his trouble. 
---
I had to put this.

This image has been around for awhile. Looks like OP just blurred a lot of it and cropped it. You can see the weird lines around the guy in the power armor from the abrupt ending of the blur effect.
---
Here is a higher resolution, uncropped, un-blurred up version I've had in my desktop rotation since before launch. 3440x1440 https://imgur.com/1ivdlZd
---
It's time consuming yeah but it's not _hard_. It's just a matter of keeping in mind who's got what and where and then just taking the time to do the run through.
---
For instance, Fort Defiance is also an excellent one stop shop for a general collection of all the harder to find things (aluminum, springs, screws, plastic, acid, lead, ballistic fiber, copper, chems, ammo, fungus) but it's easy to miss things if you don't check all the rooms including all the locked rooms and safes. It's also frequently picked over and it can take a bit of time to clear completely, but it's got a lot of the things in one go and it's nice to be able to carry too much and scrap it all at the top floor and leave. 
---
The Top of the World ski shop is a great place to swing by for aluminum and screws in the ski poles.
---
Camp McClintock (all the Army/BoS outposts really) is a great place for ballistic fiber and springs.
---
Just about all the amusement parks have toys which and great for lead, plastic and screws. And then houses and hotels will have bedrooms with toys and kitchens with household goods filled with plastic, aluminum and screws. Office and government buildings are filled with clipboards, typewriters and fans which are great for springs and screws. 
---
Well, at any rate, happy hunting!
---
My 'one trick pony' friend can 'slap' you to death with one hit with a powerfist.  3 at the most.  He 'goes to war' with people who grief him and has tracked down one griefer with the help of one of our friends and continually oneshot him until he server hopped.  Guy was level 108, he's level 136.
---
Pvp is vastly broken, still.
---
I can confirm that, and I can confirm that both pipe revolver rifles and pipe bolt action rifles benefit from both pistol and rifle perk cards. So they have a potential of 120%increased damage and 60% increased range. Plus the armor piercing of the rifle perk and the limb damage of the pistol perk. They could be better than everything but black powder rifles and The Dragon.
---
NP.
---
Holy two headed brahmin, how did I miss that? Thank you!
---
&gt;They didn't want anything other than to gang uo on a lone water farmer because he "wasn't playing the game right" when he "pussed out of PvP"
---
Sounds like they're redditors.....
---
Pacifist doesn't reduce the damage they do to you, it just makes you do no damage to them. It's designed to let you avoid accidentally engaging in PvP, To engage in PvP both parties need to hit eachother first, but you can still do a small amount of reduced damage even before that, people usually call that "slap damage".   
---
Just to inform you so you don't think you are running around protected from damage with pacifist, it only modifies your damage.
---
All of these automated attempts to give people friends are the reason why "multiplayer is toxic" is a trope. Games need to go back to people making friends by talking to each other, because then people actually have a reason to be nice.
---
well the only way to find it reasonable was not playing F4 before.
---
Guess she was right....
---
So I guess server hopping is just not something to encourage, ruin someone's experience instead, good to know redditor.
---
Wow...
---
So if someone had Gun Fu, all the other AP boosted perks, and maxed concentrated fire and adrenaline, they could take out an entire horde without leaving vats?
---
Dude that's awesome I havent launched a nuke yet, I've been taking my sweet time (level 78) and am super excited for itüòÅ
---
The damage boost is 1% 2% 3%, and it stacks over shot as long as you stay in VATS. When you exit it resets. So it would be more noticeable when you have higher AP or perks that refill it, and on higher damage guns.
---
Xbox but thanks
---
I did in the first week or so of the game, but nothing in quite a while. 
---
Why not? Wasn't civil war around the time of the carbine repeaters/Winchester's? (Lever rifles) I think they had those during the later years and following the war. Also revolvers, gatling like he said
---
 defecit ingens abominationem facientem 
---
Seriously.  It's one thing if you accidentally hit someone once or thrice in pve situations, but by the fifth hit or if they do over 25% of your health they should be given a PvP Server Prompt popup that halts their character that warns them continual assault on the player for another 25% of their health will disconnect them and put them in a survival server.
---
We never asked for GTA in Fallout.
---
It‚Äôs crazy how close to home your post hits. I work at a place where my supervisor would be at a huge loss without me, but I would be much worse off without the job. She doesn‚Äôt give me opportunities to move up, and without a degree, it is difficult to compete for better jobs within the company.

I am miserable at my desk for 8 hours a day, but when I come home and boot up my PC, I get sucked right in to the world of Fallout 76 and everything just feels so right. I love this game so much and I‚Äôm so happy that it exists. 
---
Thank you for taking the time to post your story, it‚Äôs nice to know there are others out there in similar situations. 
---
Just make sure if someone sticks a basket over your head you pretend you can't see anything. 
---
I hope not that would be terrible. 
---
Cool. I mostly run with a Quad / Fire rate Gauss and an Instigating Gauss. I‚Äôm a bit paranoid, so still carry a 1* two-shot Gauss as a third but I should probably bank it.
---
The All Rises are for when I don‚Äôt feel like sniping / too close quarters / saving ammo.

Atlas or cut damn auto correct

Same I was waiting and thinking of waiting til 100 but then said screw it haha. I was 78 before, 79 now. 
---
Why the hell can I not stop laughing at cancer bat?
---
Alt F4
---
So accuracy in vats is affected more by range than by actual accuracy. They both play a roll, but range plays a much heavier roll. Perception also helps significantly. Accuracy is more for the bullets tendency to go off the actual point you aimed at. So 100 is really all you ever need.
---
Yes

I can make one for the [handmade.](https://i.imgur.com/iL24REt.png)
---
Wow!
---
Them sure are a lot of fancy words there :)
---
Can confirm, killed a 3 star legendary protectron in watoga, it instantly exploded and despawned.  At first I thought it was launched by the explosion but after my usual systematic area sweep (not the first time those protectrons troll me like that) I found nothing at all.  Even pulled up the share menu and recorded the last 15 minutes of gameplay to verify it, instant the explosion occurred there was no body being launched, it despawned instantly upon exploding instantly upon death.
---
Wtf and why...
---
Since the  2/19 patch, I've noticed a huge an uptick in attacking workshops, to the point where I really don't bother anymore.  The change makes the place virtually impossible to protect with defenses.  Before the patch,  they could only claim the workshop from a small area.  Surround that area with turrets and traps and it discouraged them from messing with you. Now they can contest the workshop from anywhere.  It gives every advantage to the invader.
---
It has rendered workshops worthless for resources. 
---
They are now just PVP zones. 
---
A response to this that I see repeatedly  is "You don't like PVP? Go play Fallout 4!" 
---
And that's pretty much what I have been doing. 
---
nah ... and I am not alone in this opinion. Survival mode should solve the issue or at least help.... 
---
Bulk items weigh more except aluminium and lead. 
---
Based on RNG and how much a 'horde' is but yeah I guess so, iirc there's some legendary mods that would help with this, some food buffs etc like a bigger AP pool will give you more chances to proc the RNG before it's empty and more refill etc.
---
Love this theory/actual secret thing. Finally gives me a good idea for a 76 fan story.
---
I've gotten an alert anytime an actual player is attacking my camp.  Never gotten one over an NPC is and don't want to.  I'd  be getting one every few minutes if that were the case!
---
thanks
---
Same, wouldn‚Äôt mind being part of something on Xbox.  
---
If you  place some floor tiles over a Tree and it intersects.... I have been Able to remove several trees this way..... They just dissappear! 
---
As pointed out that was people getting into the dev room on PC. The problem with that wasn't just that they were in there but that they were able to access items that weren't in the rest of the game yet and began selling/trading them. 
---
Also couple times when doing the feed the people event when it breaks down and have to use computer to diagnose. It freezes up the game, have to close game and restart.
---
No. They didn't have such weapons like lever action in the main war within The Union Army.
---
Heavily confirmed, there's days where I'm lucky to loot even 3 ghouls I killed in Fort Defiance.
---
One solution I found was using plasma weapons to create plasma goo piles (which have their own similar glitches), it despawns their body and replaces it with the goo pile.
---
Which will subsequently never despawn sometimes, and that's assuming it spawns in the first place and the loot on the body transfers to the goo pile at all.
---
Many more of the buildings and structures are a part of the open world, there‚Äôs a decent amount that do have a loading screen, but I‚Äôve never had anything over 30 seconds to load. Most though are open and have no loading screens 
---
Word. Almost makes a VATS crit build worth it. Although I read something that said without the sneak multiplier VATS crits aren't much to work for.
---
I have a 3* unyielding chest piece for ya and caps of course. 
---
At work making gun parts irl... Will you be on about 1:30am mdt (e:30 edt)?
---
The first fight was revenge for my friend who was attacked at his camp. They attacked him and his wife, so he tracked them back to their house and that's where the fight began for me. I would call that griefing since he had no workshop.
---
The other fights were on my other character and we owned the food factory so I agree that that isn't griefing  (sorry for misuse of terminology). 
---
And their usernames were Wild something and Knife something (Ps4). We were all above level 100.
---
Civil war ended around 1860s I think. Repeaters and revolvers were around.  The beginning of transitioning away from manually putting wadding/powder/bullet to using cartridges like we have today
---
Phantom Spaceman!!!
---
In FO4 it was just that. Concentrated fire just allowed increased damage and accuracy for consecutive shots. I think FONV too.
---
The other day me and a couple randoms I met playing launched 3 nukes one after the other, whitesprings, then Morgantown, then fissure site prime. All in the span of about an hour and a half to two hours no problem 
---
If they can make trading from a mobile app possible, it'll be a mic drop moment for the game
---
What platform are you on? I am also a hoarder and I need to offload to my mules.
---
not really sure. If I'm not just msg me on xbox and ill get back to you ASAP
---
You're right it's common sense. The more you get out of a game, the more fun you're having. If you want to limit yourself then go ahead. I play with friends and solo, I have more fun fighting other people than scripted computers. And Mad Max is a great comparison. Great movie, because it was hectic. Who wants to watch a movie where a bunch of pansies just get along?
---
and people flipped shit when it appeared in Fo4, sealed in an unopened vault. i took jet's exclusion from the game to be Bethesda's sheepish admittance that they fucked up with the lore. 
---
The Charleston junkyard has 3 junk nodes. Be prepared for hostile takeovers though, that and poseidon are prime real estate.
---
The War Started in 1861 and ended in 1865 After The Union Army defeated The Confederate Army and throughout those battles, it were mostly powder rifles and muskets and other civil war era weapons like the cannons. The version of the lever action rifle was only given to a unit or higher up officers in rank or something like that.
---
Also fix the duping glitches with:
---
The Uplink, Gourmand's Note, and Trapper's Note all from Rose's quest.  It's getting old having to drop those two notes each time I log in, I practically use the Trapper's Note as a signature in the blue suitcase at Watoga Station now...
---
So if anyone ever sees a crap ton of ammo, plans/recipes, food, and junk in the blue suitcase with a Trapper's Note, you know who it's from now.
---
I never said it was used alot , but they were there. Maybe give yourself a Winchester or .44
---
Runescape had this, made a world of difference in its own way.
---
They asked players to break their game early.  Then banned the ones that did...
---
Some of those weapons are not in Fallout 76 besides Revolvers.
---
Lever action rifle is basically a Winchester or carbine repeater
---
How about a companion chat app? You would pretty much be texting the person.
---
I know. But the lever action rifle is more modern and it isn't like those.
---
I found one in a guard tower in WhiteSprings. 
---
thats crazy and I sure would be mad if it happened too me, I have a few disconnect issues but not 5 in a row, and nothng crazy like that in the perk screen. 
---
nice, post some pics let us see it!!!
---
Rifle gaming does a ton of great guides and experiments in Game, also made a few videos on rare outfits you can get in game through events and quests  
---
I spent about about that much time working on my fallout 4 vault. I dont think I even finished it, because I stopped when 76 came out.
---
Eh crits are different to build around but generally really strong and kind of almost the only way to scale damage although they're changing that.  So non-VATS-CRIT is pretty gimped atm, but that's getting changed a little in the nearish future.  Unless you're melee, melee should build more around pure damage % and sprinting power attacks, sneak melee doesn't really work and crit melee isn't that good either.  Iirc some guns are better or worse for crit so take that into consideration.
---
I spent an hour tonight making food and some armor and gun for a level 5 player, then explaining lots of things for him/her.  The problem is that I so rarely get the chance.  When I'm ready to drop some legendary stuff from my stash I always look at the map then msg low level players and ask if they want my stuff.  I'd say maybe 1 out of 10 even respond back.  I've only ever had 2 players take me up on my deal.  Tonight was the second and the player actually let me explain a lot of things and asked questions.  I think griefers are the largest issue why most people are afraid to respond and take me up on my offer.  Sad.
---
Why do you want to give a bad game company more of your money when everyone knows they'll lie, cheat and practically steal from their fan base?
---
Then, there'll be even more bugs for them to fix.
---
I know!  They could do a beta and only let people who preorder it play the beta and deny Steam to carry it on their site so players can't get a refund.
---
Declare it's got 16 times the detail hosted by Todd Howard with no vats or NPCs plus charge 200 times the amount for anything in the Atom shop!
---
They could sell blue tarp overpriced jackets and cheap booze in glass bottles wrapped all in cheap plastic covers!
---
Then, if that ain't enough, ban honest players who are just playing the game correctly only just carrying a little too much ammo, not talking about cheaters or dupers here, they'll get banned too.
---
Fan boys will come flying in to save Bethesda's butt as always, which Bethesda's absolutely counting on and using the Fanboys as shields so Bethesda can continue to exist as a bad greedy gaming corporation!
---
Sure!  Why not!?
---
Yeah, NO!
---
I can possibly too but that time was my first nuke, and my last (solo) i think the resources I used are worth more than the rewards I got but thats my 2 cent.
---
I run "security" for a few of the people I have met who operate shops. For some reason shops attract a lot bad attention. It makes for a fun day and decent pay.
---
I sell Glowing Blood and Glowing Meat *Steaks*, 7 caps and 10 caps respectively.
---
Great way to make some caps if you have nothing else to sell.
---
As is purified water, excess radx for mutated people, and using dog food or bobby pins to clear out those last few caps.
---
If only we could sell ammo for a fraction of caps (2-5 rounds per cap depending on ammo type) and prewar money (4 or 10 for 1 cap depending on balancing).
---
i always try to save a flare gun in my inventory but end up scrapping it on accident
---
The servers have been unusually good for me lately, actually. 
---
Answer this dude!
---
Oh lol for exact same reason I have them on stash. I have maybe 100-200, probably at least 150 now. In stash they are not in the way, if I need to find something on my relevant inventory page. Stash is by designation long term storage, so once I dump somethng there, it's out of way, out of mind.
---
Not just them but any other stuff that weights very little or nothing, like treasure maps, some extra plans I keep ect ect.
---
I think the amount of different item stacks in your inventory, slows down opening the inventory on different things like vendors, looting enemies ect.
---
So I thought if some items have smaller stack max limit, then having them that way, allows you to have two stacks. Still that's curious that things like that have small limit.
---
True, yet that forces me to stay in the same areas, at least I can rely on glowing meat when exploring~
---
farm mole miners, and office type build should have a ton off clip boards, type writers, office fans), what are you playing on, i should be able to help you.
---
The worst one so far was when I had to get the keycard from the bot flying around since I moved slowly it was a pain.
---
Of course they did. Thats how they eat. They sold their soul to promote drama and rally hate.
---
use translator xD
---
Yeah I can understand that, I'm really reluctant to pay the caps to move my base, I usually just wait until mine is occupied so I can move for free.
---
PS4
---
I havent done it recently, but I did tried it about a month ago and it did kick me out off the server but I was able to get back into the same server a few minutes later.
---
Finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary!
---
They sound like elitists, if they don't like you in "their" nuke zone, they can hop servers and join another.
---
Honestly it's not too bad, I get to enjoy the scenary and the music while I travel around. I help in fights and since I use my ap it's not super slow.
---
I believe so but I usually have some beer bottles or hardened mass unless I scrap them.
---
I have a two shot dragon on ps4 I could sell you if you want.
---
it's a damn amazing game and I am glad you've had the chance to experience the vast zen feeling it succeeds at drawing from a significant heritage of predecessors. 
---
I was really riveted as you described the profession situation you're grappling with.
---
I am glad to welcome you to the segment of humans that use games as religion, in this way.. the way to transcend the lockdown of dehumanized living we are all being force fed by broken monopolistic systems.
---
And chant the safety song!
---
That sucks! 
---
yes it is. the game is flippin unbelievably good and is on the cusp of GOAT territory, like of becoming even greater than the acknowledged masters in the entire genre of games played online.
---
Mother-in-law?
---
And it's the noise of the cow's bell in the nursery rhyme.
---
Enjoy the read! Soul Music next :)
---
I fear it will be like: "WTS BLOODIED XXX or COME SEE MY EPIC BASE"
---
Non stop 24/7 because thats what All other games with text chat becomes üòØ
---
Pvp
---
It‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs constantly repeatable and offers no reward it‚Äôs virtually a joke quest 
---
I got the same problem, I too started playing during the beta and I can say that the quests I did during the beta never unlocked the achivements for me, like coming out off the vault or reaching lvl 10 etc. 
---
Hahaha quite possibly but whose?
---
I dunno about returns, but there really should be a confirmation prompt before spending atoms on something.
---
I can see placing at the elevator to enter the silo. But not in or at the final area to the computers. 
---
You're like that guy from "Better call Saul". I godly hope youe Bethesda ID is "Sliping-Jimmy".
---
 I started leaving take out bags of free food and drinks on the order counter in my inn. They usually disappear and I find the front door open. I always get a kick out of that.
---
Are you talking about the frame stutter, slow down at the end of the video? You don't mention what kind of hard drive you have. It looks like a loading issue (in my opinion I may be wrong). In that when you move from one area to another it loads data and if your hard drive is old / slow it can slow things down. Is the game installed on an SSD hard drive or a normal hard drive? If it is a normal hard drive I would make try and defrag the drive Fallout 76 is installed on it using a program like Defraggler. I would defrag the drive numerous times, it can take hours though sometimes helps a bit.
---
If you don't have an SSD, get one, makes a huge difference to load times / loading problems. If you are using an SSD then I am not sure. If it were me and it was a big issue then I would completely uninstall the game and reinstall, possibly even do a completely clean install of Windows, format all drives and start again fresh.
---
On the plus side, now you can call your home "The Batcave."
---
what's the other "perk" on it, but the weight reduction is a plus, i have some armor with that and I think it was +1 perception or strength and some other useless perk
---
omg I love this.
---
You have to watch your screen closely. It triggers about 15 to 20 seconds  after the kill. You get 20 caps and 250 xp every time you kill one wearing the clown outfit. If you server hop white springs club house that's alot of extra xp and caps each day.
---
I saw that!  It mentions a small town that we perceived to be as China.
---
Anyone know what the name of that town is or where it's located at?
---
Is it an unmarked location?
---
Assassins Sentinel would be better, but I suggest listing it anyway... You'd probably get a couple thousand caps for it.
---
I love pvp now. It‚Äôs more tactical than it was when we had to huddle around the workshop bench.
---
\+karma
---
I bought one from the vendor in Harper‚Äôs Ferry. Not sure if it‚Äôs usually there or if it was one that someone else had sold.
---
Looks awesome. I love it when people integrate their camps into existing towns or structures.
---
Weird. I have heard before that pipe weapons can double dip into pistol and rifle perks.
---
What's the fuzz about Graham? Finally saw him for the second time in over 300 hours played a couple of days ago, but he had nothing of interest or plans I haven't seen at other vendors... So what's the fuzz about???
---
I have learned both mods, recon and night vision.  I know this because I like the recon but find it too bulky in my field of view.  I prefer the long scope so I gravitate to the night vision version, I just don‚Äôt like the colors that it uses, so I rarely attach it.  
---
I just logged in and confirmed it.  I have the long night vision scope for the combat rifle, hunting rifle, shotgun, and now the Pipe Rifle.   After logging in i went for a short run around the raider camp near top of the world and just found the night vision plans for the pipe rifle. 
---
Blocker + reactive plates
---
You mean min character level of 100....
---
Leather jacket and red bandana for his scarf 
---
Gg
---
I'm actually going with a pipe weapon build since the ammo is plentiful, and they can be made indestructible and the revolver and bolt action benefit from rifle and pistol perks. For rn my pipe bolt action at level 20 does 90 damage a shot, and I almost always have a 95% chance to hit and 400 ammo to burn. If I manually aim most things die from crit+sneak attack as long as they are within range. I have a suppressor but idk if I'm going mr sandman because you can't co trol the time of day and I don't like bonus damage that is there sometimes but not at others.
---
You did it wrong, the real secret is Batboy! Nuke the Uncanny Caverns!
---
I don't know about the 10mm but I'd try and see if the gunslinger perk effects the tweaked receiver.
---
How about a 2 star Assasins Explosive combat rifle?  I bought it for 560 from the Watoga vendor bot thinking it should be worth more.  I've been buying up all the cheap/seems like a good deal stuff I can find to turn them in to the Purveyor.  Is there somewhere I can check the going rate/value of legendaries?
---
Tyvm
---
Just getting on now. I accepted your friend request, and I don't see you online. I'll try to catch you tomorrow.
---
Hunting rifle gets night vision? That's my build 
---
seems to me if they build in those spots, that's the experience they must want
---
Probably worth 2-3k caps
---
You could try submitting a ticket and explain your situation. They usually refund you in case of accidental purchases. I have seen it happen before on this sub. You could try tweeting @Fallout too for extra visibility.
---
Grats, my quest popped back unfinished as many others. 
---
I gave my All Rise to a random stranger. Then I crouched and positioned my head in their crotch.
---
It was my good deed for the day.
---
Yeah it would definitely be cool to have a place to meet and trade, get help and tips and tricks from people in our community. 
---
Gigantopithecus Chungus 
---
They are great for pve and ok for pvp. A gamma gun destroys bloodied builds in pvp. If you have the commando card set a auto radium rifle also smokes them. Bloodied is one of the strongest dps builds, but it can be countered pretty easy in pvp.
---
that would be great, specially the total weight on the tap.
---
What's the point in that?
---
yes, I feel your the pain, I like to get 100% on the games im a fan off,
---
The only material outof those I run short on are screws. I use a lot of springs and adhesive but theyre usually easy enough to find. 
---
Thanka for the heads up. Wasnt sure what the weakness was. Ill be holding on to a radiation weapon from now on.
---
I havent got any TSE drops or any other cool legendary weapon like that
---
So if I'm selling or giving someone an item with the paint job already on it, I don't have to remove it to trade and then they put it right back on. 
---
For example, I gave a friend an X-01 stealthboy torso that had the camo paint on it. He already has it unlocked (and had it on his PA). I had to remove the paint to give him the torso, then he reapplied it. This is moronic. If we both have rights to the paint, then what's the hold up?  
---
I've \[implemented\]([https://github.com/akarnokd/rng-76/blob/master/index.html#L670](https://github.com/akarnokd/rng-76/blob/master/index.html#L670)) an experiment myself before to see the outcome.
---
&gt; a giant database table with any permutation of all possible 
---
This would be inefficient. I'm almost sure there loot properties are generated step-wise.
---
Also the data shows that the loot is not split 33-33-33 among Armor/Melee/Ranged, but works on a full table of about 200 items, and the game picks one entry at random. There are 8 base armor types, 5 body parts and many armor type has sturdy and heavy, the total number is around 100. That's more than half of the loot pool.
---
Jesus Christ. Don't look at this fool's post history like I did.
---
It's done to items to prevent you from dropping Atom shop items. You can build Atom shop items in a friend's camp if both of you have it. I do get your point. It is definitely inconvenient.
---
Well, maybe it is. My first language in not english so my system and the game are set to my language, meaning they could translated voices wrongly. I don't kmow.
---
Healing factor has been broken for a long time, though its more connected to the sneak than mutation but anyway
---
Bloodied builds are quite powerful, but the fact that they have little health means only a small amount of your damage actually has pass their armor to get the kill.  Rads can screw with their build and force them to try to rebalance, but if they get below 10% their damage will go WAY up. Anything that inflicts bleed or poison damage is an issue too.
---
Your problem was the explosive effect. Fireproof and Emergency Protocols pretty much negates damage from TSEs (and I would assume AAEs as well) from what I've experienced in PvP. Have never been taken out by anyone using an explosive legendary. 
---
Also, some rely on Dodgy for damage reduction. High RoF weapons will completely deplete their AP, meaning if you sprint away, they can't give chase easily nor can they use VATS. 
---
Let‚Äôs put it this way, I‚Äôm pretty sure that the player telling you to get off of his lawn took advantage of Nuke events that others initiated.  So, they are just being jerks by trying to impose their own play style on you.  
---
Nuke zones are a free for all.  However, common courtesy is to share kills, especially 2* and 3* legendary kills.    I‚Äôve been known to lead a swarm to other players when I‚Äôm the only one in an area after tagging them all once. 
---
Yeah. Grafton dam is bugged for me too.
---
Well, i have an hard time placing my base exactly where i need it so i sometimes had to move it a few times in a row. And on my first toon i didn't it wasn't free....
---
I guess I need to add "don't transfer  important stuff into or out of stash" to my list of "things to not do if I smell an unstable server in the air". This game is witchcraft sometimes, with the list of things you have to do (or avoid doing) to prevent the game from biting you.
---
I am on pc. The first rank of heavy gunner unlocks at lv 30
---
I'm pretty sure that's my bat. Do me a favor and look at it's collar and tell me if says "Hi my name is Denise. If I'm lost please return me to my family at 8888 Kanye West Ave Wakarusa, IN 46573
---
Commentors note: I googled the zip code for Wakarusa, IN for the sake of plausibility.
---
No collar no chip. I think it's a stray.
---
I like to move my camp every know and then, everytime my camp is max budget. I have also lvled a few times between each camp move, not sure how many lvls but I can say every time I move my maxed budget camp i get a budget increase. I do not know if it has to do with the location or my lvl but it has happened to me in more than one occation. 
---
Works for me fine on PC. Although I have only seen it very few times, since I kinda CAMP in an isolated place where I imagine not a lot of players find much reason to hang around: the Ash Heap.
---
The gamma and rad rifle won't help much with a bloodied in PA. In regular armor it'll cause some problems though.  The rad resistances of PA are just too high for the gamma to do any good. 
---
Plus AA is messed up for energy weapons from what I understand. My AA gamma gun is pretty much useless in PvP.
---
/r/IAmVeryBadass
---
Well that figures. I guess I'll go to Kinko's tomorrow morning and start putting up flyers. 
---
Screws and aluminum for me.   It used to be gears and springs.   However, I‚Äôve finally found a decent farm source for aluminum and I‚Äôm over the hump of being able to farm lead now that I know about lead pencils and toys. 
---
I need to do some more power plant runs as there tends to be a decent amount of screws. 
---
Hope you find your loud buddy.
---
Yesterday 2 high level players helped my level 15 character, giving me tons of goodies, including radaway, treasure maps, ans a few legendary and bulk. Later during the day had two high level players attack me in whitesprings trying to kill me for no reason, I server jumped just in time before getting killed, So yes 75 percent of the people playing are great and fun to be with but there‚Äôs about a 25 percent being assholes, anyways on Xbox, I thank the other players making the game fun.
---
Thanks I appreciate you saying that.
---
My experience with other players on xbox is a pretty mixed one.
---
Maybe just for when a player does damage?
---
I had a similar experience. I was around 60 and all of a sudden I hear the emote sound going off and assumed it was me needing more water because I was in build mode and couldn't see my thirst. I was in the middle of building my current base. Next thing I know some dude is talking to me and admiring my base. It took me a min to find my headset but it was one of the best experiences I've had in the game. He reminded me to lock my shit, I hadn't yet because I was still building. It was just a pleasant experience with some guy before he logged off. 
---
Reactive plates and full blocker can withstand someone with a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet and power attack. I usually try to experiment with PvP setups with folks I trade with and found someone to try that combo with. They also had 3 sentinel pieces. He brought me down to about 20% health and then I was able to stagger and kill him easily.
---
All builds are beatable.
---
Brave 
---
Yes did happen on Xbox, noticed it last week.
---
Need a bullet holes and blood paint scheme. 
---
Haven‚Äôt noticed same general pause before going into different maps or menus
---
The fire rate is the difference. My tse .50 Cal kills sb faster than my tse Gatling gun. Though I do find that there are enemies that die faster with the Gatling gun vs the .50 Cal and vice versa
---
Got stuck once at like 37% I think. Waited around forever down there slaughtering bots. Eventually the room just randomly goes dark and the countdown mission completed. 
---
Broadsider counts as explosive?
---
Start charging it rent.
---
That's awesome, just like Moira's shop.
---
I probably shouldn‚Äôt jinx myself, but nobody has attacked my Camp yet.
---
Maybe I should stop hiding in the hills. Where are you guys camping? 
---
[His thought process after entering your CAMP...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fE2GyVMGCA)
---
Really love the general exploration with friends. 
---
It's neat to play Fallout and share the games feeling with others. 
---
Denise is a charming name. Getting a collar on Denise was probably an adventure it itself. 
---
Looks fantastic - reminds me of The Castle in Fo4.
---
I find more of my fingers fall off...
---
How can you se the character name? I can only see the Bethesda account name.
---
Been getting some great help which has helped me level up. I can now share the love with other low levels. Only found a few idiots that seem to get their kicks killing lower levels.
---
Yep. I also loot sugar grove and watoga high school often.
---
We got Denise a collar when she was a just a wee batling and she was very receptive to the collar from the first time we put it on. Our town has very strict leash ordinances for pets and we have "those" kind of neighbors right across the street from us.
---
It's just a videogame. Getting emotionally invested and triggered by actions over fake resources and fake currency in a fake digital world is pretty silly. I'm a dick in the game for resources. PvP is a part of the game. Don't like it? Don't take workshops. 
---
You have to drop the frame from inventory to let someone else have it. There's also been a bug (is it still there?) that makes people fast travelling in power armor sometimes leave an empty frame that's not really an in-world frame, but just a graphical glitch.
---
Elder Scrolls Online has the ESO Plus subscription. It's optional, but it comes with a bag that will hold all your crafting materials. Tbh, that's the direction that I think they will go eventually. If they do things the same way as Bethesda/Zenimax did in ESO, then we would get an unlimited stash for scrap, if we pay a monthly subscription ($15 per month, which includes 1500 atoms as well, along with other bonuses). I'm curious if they will follow ESO in this.
---
Remember, Mad Libs? That‚Äôs what it all reads like to me. 
---
No but I found lore on the faschnaut parade event.
---
No shit they're PvP... I think that's exactly what he's saying. Its a design flaw, or at the very least an unbalanced framework.  Everyone benefits from workshops... decent xp, resources, and fast travel hubs.  So when a lower level player takes advantage of the workshop they are at the mercy of some dick head kid who apparently has way too much time on their hands with their level 250 character out looking for the "biggest advantage of winning against the weakest target possible".  The weaker player has no recourse whatsoever except to take it in the ass and deal with it. Now that doesn't exactly sound like strategic gameplay. It's not in the spirit of fair and leveled fight. Its lazy and stupid.  And just because someone probably didn't to you when you were a noob doesn't make it ok for you to one-shot lower level players because it makes you feel tough.  
---
I swear, there is seriously something wrong with people who kill other low level players for fun - knowing there is no way they can fight back. And yeah, that's a flaw in the workshop PvP framework. 
---
Not just in PvP. It allows you to punch way above your weight in PvE as well.
---
Thank you for the reminder that blocker is an overall fantastic perk and one that - shame on me - I discovered very late in the game.
---
The glitch is still there but it happens at an almost nonexistent rate now compared to before when it happened nearly every single time. I try to only use PA when it's a nuke zone or if I'm by myself and I get myself in a jam so I wasn't aware about dropping frames from your inventory. Does it show up in a paper bag like everything else?
---
The very effective feeling of FOMO to drive impulse purchases 
---
I have if you have more than 2 players it has a slight chance to stop the bar just have one or two people in there at a time
---
Not straight to the point...but best post yet on this sub. I have also uninstalled....playing Anthum now as most my community friends got banned and most of them not been duppers...but just had more than there cut off amount at some point in time due to pick ups etc.....but well before that big ban hammer they had already dropped inventory and had clean accounts but got banned anyway as it was filled through any 30 day duration. So any way ....we all left the game because we all play games together. We all played eso together, but now left that too as Bethesda are just pathetic developers.
---
Their stupid RND is the thing that drove everyone into looking for weapons by any means on top of total boredom ...having nothing else to do and also the way op melee made every other build look like babies in nappies....so you had to get an explosive 2 shooter.......well now....the boredom of been a melee was also to painful to bare....so f*u besthesda for been so incompetent.
---
I had to move not long after it was released, so there's been quite a few updates since then. I'm definitely looking forward to finally getting back into it. I think my not being around has also been why my hubby hasn't played in awhile. 
---
I‚Äôd recommend a 50cal or a Gatling gun for your first heavy. Gatling is the most ammo/repair efficient, and fairly accurate with Stabilized, but some people can‚Äôt stand how slow it fires. 50cal is badass, but keeping it fed with ammo means grabbing all the lead, steel, and gunpowder you can get your hands on. 
---
I got the game shortly after release, and have played nearly every day since. Where's my Blackbird?
---
Fair enough, although I don't remember ever coming across either of those until much later in the game
---
Now why did you do that? I try to avoid going through people's post history because is very easy to fall into the psychological trap of 'well I don't agree with what you post on a different sub therefore your opinion is invalid in this sub too'.
---
I went ahead and looked anyway; took your warning as a dare.
---
@OP, dude, use an alt!
---
Depends on what your interests are.
---
I‚Äôm a member of a group. 
---
Brotherhood of Steel (Light RP and casual group)
---
But we have XBox and PS4 communities. 
---
Oh man, what about bigger CAMP build limits? Like everyone gets a starter camp like we have now, but if you have Atoms you can get more budget. 
---
Munitions Factory. Anytime I‚Äôm there I here him outside. 
---
I just meant like a Reddit Xbox community for fallout. I'm sure there's are communities for rp and groups and stuff like that. But just browsing through Reddit fallout communities, it just seems predominantly PlayStation players. 
---
Especially when everyone and their mom is a "streamer" these days.
---
I too fix other players camp that I stumbled across. Once I was being attacked by sone gulpers and high level milurks and ran into another player‚Äôs camp nearby, It saved me but did massive damage to their camp, as they tore away at the turrets and walls, so used my stash and fixed everything for them, it was north west of Watoga if I remember.
---
I've started saving known plans so if I start an alt I can just give it the plans. 
---
It can last 20 years in a broken refrigerator, but not 30 minutes in your pockets. RIP. 
---
I also got an AA Broadsider today, and this is a good question. Hmmmm.
---
You can't Starch the buff, but the mutation does stay after it wears off.
---
I've never been in that situation but I would definitely do the same thing you did after the fight was over.  I will admit my turrets are protected by locked doors just to make harming one of them harder and as a nasty surprise for the other.
---
Good night, West Virginia!
---
it takes a while before it leaves.
---
There's a .50 that spawns on the back of a truck if you follow the road east from the clarksburg shooting club. It's level 25.
---
Dying SHOULD be punishing. It's dying. That's the point of it in a video game. I donf think you were the evil griefer you thought you were. 
---
Very strange bug.. how long were you down there slaughtering bots? I was down there 20-30 minutes and just gave up. Also how many people were you with?
---
Thanks! So I should use AAE for PvE?
---
Where did you find this out?
---
3 I think. We were down there for probably 15-30 minutes. Don't recall exactly, but i was aggravated because I could have made an entire run in the time we wasted waiting but we'd already launched the other two silos on that server. 
---
I had to look up ‚ÄúNegan‚Äù

Combat rifles are generally not very sought after, in my experience. The handmade does the same job infinetly better, 
---
Nice, well done.
---
Carnivore
---
You may want to list your platform. I assume you mean you have mats ?
---
My TS hunting rifle miss a lot. My TS handmade performs better. At least I think it does. Waiting for the VATS to zoom in (there's a sound) is important. 
---
fantastic!!! this is inspiring!
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Just got Executioners Radium Rifle (1 star) and allready running a commando set all the time.
---
Time to go hunting for those bloodied wanted guys.
---
I love finding a pristine location that has just been  respawned. It's like Christmas. I really hated the hunger and thirst dynamic at first. Now I actually like it. It does add an element of urgency at moments.
---
\*grabs popcorn\*
---
New meta right here. It'll be all over the you tubes tomorrow.
---
Well watched the stream and she didn‚Äôt seem very upset at all when killed ? Shrugged it of and continued to play ?
---
Place you camp at a aluminium deposit, have an unlimited supply .. junk deposits also give you springs albeit slowly. Make sure you have the power armour level 3 perk to reduce crafting requirements.
---
I would sell that for 300 caps (1 star = 100 caps), like all my armors in my store.
---
During the beta we used to get nuclear material from them, then it just stopped when it went live, so I don't bother any more.
---
I just learned, after losing t45 and t51 sets, that you have to push A (xbox) to equip the power armor and it will "set" it in front of you. DO NOT DROP.
---
I had an AA m79 and wondered the same thing. No one seemed interested when I posted it on the market. 
---
Had to take a gander... holy shit dude. What a creep. 
---
There is a lot of them that doesn't counted. Problem is, they've kinda fixed few, but it appear not fully - until recently I've enjoyed fulfilling magazines ones - collected all G&amp;B, Grognak and L&amp;L and when I thought I can close Scout's life it appeared it's broken - I've just collected the only missing one, #4 in the cravesse dam and it still shows me 9/10.
---
Same is with killing big enemies - 10/13 all the time and countless SBQ didn't registered. The developers are very lazy in that matter...
---
Yea I was pretty aggravated too 
---
Just checking. Iv'e never got that rich bounty from whitesprings.
---
I REALLY WISH ID KNOWN THEY HAD STEALTH MADE MARSUPIAL SUPER RARE BEFORE TRYING TO DI THIS
---
Fus...roh...
---
Collecting stuff and building is my end game, it was in Fallout 4 and I want it to be in Fallout 76 but you're right, the budget is poor it makes end game building pretty much impossible.  CAMP items are the only purchases I would make from the store and if you can't build it or display it, well...
---
Its very discouraging. I see no point in even fighting it. Its a huge waste of time and ammo and ive waited over 30 minutes just for the loot loading circle to finish. I have never gotten loot from the queen. This is what i worked up to for endgame? 
---
&gt; I let my friends know that a player who chose the name of a character  famous for killing people and taking their stuff had just shown up at my  base. 
---
He was nice, he only wanted half your shit but you refused so he had to make a point smashing your friends head in with his barbed-wired baseball bat.
---
Given the fact that this is the apocalypse, I think he's a pretty reasonable guy :P
---
&gt;!In the Glassed Caverns, one of the miners gets trapped in with the Ultracite experimentation just before the Great War. IIRC: look in the lockers/tables.!&lt;
---
i cant give plans to my alts, no friends play this game anymore and got alresdy scammed 3 times by other players who were willing to help.
---
190 levels and the only explosive I ever got was an explosive SMG from a mirelurk queen. Sold it.
---
My camp is *just* passed the Whitespring train station, a nuke came down last night and took out the cars in the car park!  
---
Living on the edge :)
---
For the cost of a full AAA game, you shouldn't have to buy storage just because of clueless developers who can't make a stable world, just a bad idea. If this was free to play then maybe, but it's not.
---
We should have much more storage for the money we paid, we shouldn't have to pay extra, just no.
---
It's a fun one for pvp. I pve with rifleman and tried the radium for pvp it's ok. Then tried pvp with full commando and auto radium and it just melts people not just bloodied builds. Here is a extra tip, with four leaf clover maxed and a auto, like every other hit is a crit. With autos you can hold down the crit button and the trigger and crits fire off as soon as you get them. This is huge in itself but it gets better, crits bypass sentinels and cavalier armor, you can melt the best geared players ingame. I use an aa one with  the armor piercing perk card so even if they are in power armor they go by by. Have yet to find a build it will not melt in 2 to 3 seconds.
---
A dude or the *Dude*?
---
If you in a team, each team mate can get a free nuke card from the same cargo bot drop, so get as many people together before taking it out and you get a load of cards, I have 2 characters, so can get 3 at a time before it explodes. But in theory in you only need 1 as long as you don't type in the wrong code, but it is good to have few in case.
---
You could always build/buy a basic Broadsider and test it on enemies with high armour
---
irl that rasied track is based on the PRT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgantown_Personal_Rapid_Transit
---
I found a 3 * two shot broadsides the other day and it does look badass!
---
Personally, I judge people based on what they say or how they act in the context of each individual situation, thus such psychological traps aren't a thing for me.  For example he's being a bit of an ass here and possibly an idiot as well.  Looking at his other posts, he seems to be into certain substances and a horndog(which many people find creepy, I personally just find it sad, but to each their own).  On the upside, his poetry skills aren't bad, lewd, but not bad.  It's a bit more direct, but also far more simplistic than the likes of Crowley.

---
Well I didn't know that, once you take it and take it back to your camp there is a option to defend it? Is animal friend under charisma?
---
I've run across so many streamers in R6Siege.... they've all been total ******** who try and start team kill fights and manufacture conflict between players on the same team just to get page views. My policy is to take none of their shit, and deny them content. Either destroy them and humiliate them in-game, or be totally passive and boring so that they move on and don't use you in an edit. 
---
In this game I'd just put away my gun and heart emote if I thought I couldn't beat them. Wait till they move on. 
---
I agree with everything you said.
---
Thus I don't take any of them at all.  With the workshop nerf, the defender has even a bigger disadvantage.  Its just a griefing setup.   
---
It runs off to your camp on foot after yuu tame it. My Radtoad never defended but my Deathclaw automatically does. Yep animal friend under charisma. 
---
Well thank you for the advice, time to retire the turrets and get a proper defence üòÅ
---
Yes you can craft night vision scope for all weapons but you can't learn the mod by scrapping only finding the plan let you know the mod
---
You're why I can never have that spot for more than one login, telling people about it and shut. Damn you! Lol. 
---
I used the soot flowers to make healing salves (bloodleaf and sootflower are super common + green thumb and butcher's bounty while getting my food together).
---
I now have a super awesome, secluded junk node. Haven't had to world hop to keep it at all yet. Guarded on 3 sides, flat ground, plenty of room for farming. A spawn of like 20-30 scorched barely outside of render distance. No, I'm not telling anyone where it's at. I killed the last person that stumbled across it. üòÇüòÇJK. Or am i.
---
I haven't really killed Scorchbeasts except the one in the cave near Fissure Site Prime.
---
Godddamn, now I want to see about making a tertiary character and see how closely I can get a character to match his canonical appearance. I feel like the game gives us just about everything we need [aside from maybe his great big jawline.](http://media.comicbook.com/2015/11/negan-158661.jpg) 
---
Lovely. Great spot too.
---
Join r/fo76FilthyCasuals then :P
---
That's the place to be for people who actually want to have fun with the game ;-)
---
I will give away this one since I don't use it anymore; in the toxic valley due east of the Black Bear Lodge is a junk node. Just slightly up the hill is a lead node. If you place your camp right, you can have both. You're welcome.
---
I bet you're a social worker, I know when your visiting my neighbourhood, I can hear them all screaming and trying to run away.
---
Time to install spring traps to toss them into your neighbors yard 
---
The fact that our characters are building these things out of bits of metal and ceramic we find in the world - building them new, from scratch - and apparently choose to build them in such a way as to make them look like they've been exposed to the elements for a couple of decades never ceases to baffle me. 
---
My headcanon with respect to all of the broken windows in the 'barn' set is that our characters have some sort of weird OCD which compels them to break all of the windows by hand immediately after completing their construction. 
---
That's the trade off. You are a powerhouse but you are also a glass cannon. Personally I love using bloodied weapons, melee and ballistic, it's a high risk but fun play style.
---
Hmm... its overlooking Charlston from the Ash Heap by the looks of it.
---
This is a bug that causes non-robot mobs that spawn in the same area as robot mobs, to have on hit/damage/death effects as robots, with some of the visuals(in the case of Sentry Bots), while maintaing the visuals/movement/attack patterns of the non-robot.  Also, even if the non-robot enemy you are fighting isn't legendary, this robot they are "overlaying" can be, which can lead to suprise explosions if you aren't careful, since legendary robots explode a short while after being killed.
---
Nice job! üëçüèªüòÅ
---
You have a bad attitude. People like you are the blight on the community, not the people that want to believe there can be something more to something they enjoy. Yeah. Data mining. We get it...
---
 But if you haven't tried to push a truck located in an obscure location to see if there is really a hidden Mew there that your best friend swears his cousin's friend's big brother caught, or beaten an alien flying machine down a tunnel to get access to an overpowered covenant laser gun, this isn't for you.
---
You're getting your jollies from sitting there like a know it all... Okay fine. You win the internet. Now go away. Let people play the game and capture the magic of not knowing everything and having to find it out the fun way.
---
Are you here to be better than everyone? Or are you here to have fun?
---
Visit Whitesprings golf club and west tek everytime you login, it gives a fuck ton of XP
---
You want to get the SPECIALs based on what perks you intend on getting actually.
---
The PERKS you want to get should be based off what type of character you want to play.
---
Unless you are melee, always get Gunsmith perk.  It increases durability on all rifles, launchers, pistols, miniguns, gatling, ect
---
If you want melee build, you need strength.
---
If you want rifle build, you are going to need perception because thats where the perks are.
---
If you want pistol build, you need agility.
---
If you want a stealth build with the Rifle/Pistol, you are going to need Luck perks (this is usually taken on a Non-PA Build)
---
If you want to go without Power Armor (PA), then you are going to need many perks to help reduce damage in normal armor (Agility perks, Blocker strength, white Knight perk in Endurance?)
---
If going with Power armor, you really don't need any perks except the ones that make repairs cheaper, they get rather costly on some.
---
Keep in mind that you should be focusing on weight reduction perks right away because you are going to have issues.  Also keep in mind that if you want to go rifles, you will have massive problem with weight.  The reason is because rifles have no weight reduction perks, plus you need to focus most of your perks in Perception/Luck (not strength).
---
Initially, its good to pick up everything, but dont keep everything.   Sell any junk components in excess of 100 except Steel, Lead, Screws, Springs, Plastic, Adhesive.    You need 1000-1500 steel, as much of the others as you can get.
---
The ammo is really expensive for it.
---
But I like the pretty boxes on my shelf :(
---
I don't get this, until bethesda does something about it, you're basically griefing them. I don't care that you don't like it, and I don't care if people grief, but just call it what it is. 
---
You really  expected , after all  ,  that Bethesda is capable  to design  little deeper    and more  interesting  ending?? Fallout 76 is   wide   as a ocean  and deep  as a pond. Someone once said.  So true.
---
If you are on ps4, I could help you.
---
Do u mean buy the mod at vendor 
---
found a full set on a cliff and wore it for a while. It broke and i made a new set of cheaper.
---
From what I understand: 
---
Have some friends and join the server they are on
---
Drop all your unwanted stuff in a paper bag (your trusted friends stay near that bag so it doesnt dissapear)
---
Log out and switch to your second character, join the same server again
---
Collect the items
---
Oh shit sorry, PS4 and the last W was an H üòÇ
---
the plans have a small chance to drop from monsters and events "post patch", my friend found his first plan from "enclave" watoga dropped connection event
---
I would could these as two for u
---
Yes sir im from ps4 :)
---
looks a bit like the firebreather outfit, but doesn't look quite right. could be a regular fireman outfit.
---
I‚Äôd rather see them focus their efforts making all the current camps pieces function. Like the wall hanging cabinet that only places half way through a floor. Or the traps and power connectors, many which have problems. 
---
The flame sword is fine, at least it kills things. Use it any where except the cranberry bog. 
---
Guess you'll have to call pest control :P
---
Could be a backpack :o
---
Honestly I have no idea.

Looks like the Xbone squad is lighting our torches.

You can find the mod at the vendor or the plan for the mod like a drop from events, maybe like a world spawn too
---
I'm only a Level 13 player still really finding my footing and the number of players who have invited me to join their team and have helped me along the way is what's really sold me on FO76. It's really lovely having such a good community. 
---
I'm glad Negan visited your C.A.M.P.
---
Happened a similar glitch to me. I fast traveled to the entrance, went all the way back a couple of times and the event suddenly finished on 50%. I was able to launch.
---
3x accidentally hitting someone? Naw if they don‚Äôt care where their bullets land, they should not be warned. That 2nd hit, should make them automatically go. If you warn them before being sent to pvpland, they won‚Äôt care about accidental damage, or they will work the system so they can damage.
---
It's good that you found something to set your mind at ease and break from the real world for a few moments; on a long term this is very beneficial for your health and kept me sane in my work environment; in time maybe you can discover other things too that have the same effect - variety of options is always good
---
The only time I've had another player shoot at me was when I first started and didn't quite understand all that was going on and tried to unlock a stash drop they'd defended. A couple of warning shots and that was all. 
---
It's a great community, in my experience so far.
---
People badmouth FO76 for very valid reasons. First and foremost, its an EA style cash grab; releasing something that barely qualifies as a BETA and demanding a AAA price tag for it.   
---
I'm only three days into FO76 but so far I'm not particularly impressed, especially at the lack of quality from the finished product. It very much looks like they simply re-skinned Skyrim, then added guns and radiation. But also fucked up the NPC movements. It really does look like a seven year old title. 
---
If I'd paid full price for this, I'd be demanding a refund, but its just about acceptable for ¬£10. 
---
OK. I like to leap into packs of Muties in my Jet Packed X0-1 and stab em' all to death with my Combat Knife. Its surprisingly effective and very entertaining but I do take damage. ;) I've also been testing DPS on a pack of Gulpers at Watoga Train Yard, they spawn quite reliably for me. Again I do get info on the actual kill speed of various One Hand weapons but the incoming is real strong there. 
---
 Probably not for me. Thanks for the explanation.
---
It is? Crap. I was gonna make some and main it.
---
I‚Äôd rather have Jet as an interesting drug than worry about lore or Myron‚Äôs single claim to fame. 
---
Yea, I've noticed them landing a lot more too...lets me get some good hits with my TS Fatman....before they start to run at me and chase me.
---
If you are referring to the case that holds the overseers log, then it's to the left of the "mayor "
---
Maybe like the hunted. We have diff radio stations we can join if we are looking for team.mates.
---
Perhaps faction radios and if you say listen to brotherhood radio you auto join their team?
---
Haha, I love it when people act all scared when you visit their CAMP. I'm always just dropping them random building Plans once I see they enjoy to work on their camps. 
---
It is an audio-loading stutter due to high memory usage. I get this a lot on my 16 GB machine (i7 4770k), even with SATA SSD (500 MB/s). Quit as many applications as you can and it gets better. However, prolonged play may bring it back. Also sometimes when two players get into range, it triggers more loading and thus stutter.
---
I have no such (visible) issues with i7 8700, 32GB RAM and an NvMe SSD (3.5 GB/s).
---
So true. Though, I try not to think about such reality. I play this game with my one eye closed lol
---
I go one better and say, why no love for just standard armor? I haven‚Äôt seen anyone not wearing an outfit in... months? Maybe ever, seriously. The armor has all sorts of way to mix and match pieces for an interesting look. It‚Äôs not all about how much damage you can block. 
---
Oh god who lets this guy in again?
---
Nah, just use a reflecting melee weapon and watch the bloodied melee builds kill themself
---
yeah it's like a green camo version of it, same numbering on backpack I noticed.
---

---
 Yeah I can get it to about 100b 45e with a 200% Repair but even my Anti Armor 40% Speed one, pales compared to my Nocturnal Combat Knife, and is about the same as my Serrated Combat Knife with no stars, but repaired to 200%.
---
 I have not put the extra jets on as I need a card, and my Combat Knives are just so good.
---
Think this is a really good idea however the max size should only be like 500 atoms therefor people can quite easily earn the atoms through challenges,
---
why would you apologize? 
---
you did not brake the game rules and if they got owned on live stream it's their problem (and embarasement)
---
I would not worry about repercussions ...
---
I am not sure but I believe when player joins a blast zone more glowing ghouls will spawn. But events spawn more 3 star legendarys imo.
---
Not likely. I launched 3 nukes by myself, all hitting Whitesprings within 30 minutes; no server or client crash. 
---
Another time I launched 3 nukes one after another deliberately trying to miss Fissure Prime; no stability issue there but the game still spawned 3 queens and changed my 3rd nuke's landing point in a way that it overlapped Prime anyway.
---
I've only had it happen with SBs in a nuke area.
---
How is this still an issue. I'm dealing with it still, 3 months later. 
---
So far I have bleedout, bloatfly, endagerol, and radscorpion. It does not appear to have a level cap, and it's possible that enemies do not have any poison resistance just like we don't unless we have a legendary prefix on armor.
---
I want to test and see if the poisons stack. Like could we theoretically apply 3 radscorpion poisons to the same enemy, making it 120 unmitigated damage over time? Does the damage resistance reduction stack? ( it only lasts for two seconds though, so someone would literally have to apply that while you were shooting the SBQ or an alpha death law etc). It would appear it was meant to be a support type weapon, maybe even a way for someone to tag multiple enemies without doing enough raw damage to pull aggro so they still get exp. If the bloatfly syringer barrel had a decent chance at spawning legendaries I would be impressed also. Low level scorched towns would be great farming grounds. If the bloatfly corresponds to your own level and not that of the enemy it's in. A lot of experiments need to be done.
---
We went in there too. It's a pretty good tease.
---
I would repost this in a way that's not so passive aggressive. You're not going to get a great response to cussing and yelling about it. Make your point and move on
---
Also of note the poisons are a shorter range and the debuffs appear to have longer ranges so far.
---
No, sadly. That's a rad TV
---
Another PSA: Blocker doesn't work that well. "44% damage reduction of melee attacks" my ass. 
---
Just fyi you also need to wear the clowns hat for the mission to complete.
---
 Like mine you mean. Its pretty rare but works very well.
---
 My Rifles hit real hard and my Combat Knives are terrifying. My Shotguns are some what neglected as I have a level 20 Large Mag Explosive one and its so good I have left that area alone. Its starting to show its limitations though.
---
 Level 72 right now. ;)
---
 Good Strength and Perception with, for me, 4 Charisma for Lone Wanderer. I solo the game mostly. Around 6 for Agility and where you can get a 20% Speed buff with Gunrunner, if you slot a Pistol. I have more Inteligence than a non crafter type needs but its very useful and where your Explosive buffs sit.
---
 Wing it. ;)
---
Yeah that's exactly what the siren does. If you turn it on and leave whenever another player attacks your base you'll get an alert like when mobs attack your workstation. The only problem is that it is annoying, it seems to always turn by its self whenever the game loads your base or whenever you fast travel there. My boys and I tested it out a couple months ago. 
---
Again? First time I've made a comment in here. 
---
Though this does go to show that there is obviously a common theme to the complaints against FO76.
---
im lvl 78 and finished all the quest that I can do, still have overseers mission and the whitespring golfer mission.
---
Im just still trying to get my build where it needs to be and legendary weapons and plans farming for the most part. I have also started to helping low lvl players, I have seen a growning number the past few weeks. 
---
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèwell done üòÅüòÅ
---
Your default audio input needs to be set to your microphone your using.  Fallout 76 doesn‚Äôt have an in game option to do this and uses your input device from your pc. If that‚Äôs just set to default it won‚Äôt pick anything up it needs to be set to your actually device. At least that‚Äôs how I fixed my problem which was the same one your having now it seems. 
---
The queens table and a normal beast tables are the same. The queens however has a guaranteed   chance at legendary item and plans/mods while Normal beasts only have a slight chance at plans/mods. That‚Äôs why no one kills her any more because she isn‚Äôt special. 
---
 Stuff gets in your face. What you gonna do, shoot it?
---
Ok cheers i got excited for a min there it would have gone perfect in my camp
---
Please make it your last.
---
Remember tranquility lane from fallout 3?
---
&gt; this person went through the hassle and effort to summon a nuke 
---
That's entirely their fault. Don't feel bad.
---
I got two prime receivers from them yesterday whilst helping some one do the BOS quest line though glass caverns.
---
Check it's "pockets" for a rolling pin or maybe something wooden you can wear. 
---
&gt;before they start to run at me and chase me
---
:) I have a mental image, you waving your arms in the air screaming SB in hot pursuit.
---
This sounds good! And do you have any perk cards equipped that buff any kind of weapon damage (I saw there are some for 10% more shotgun damage etc)? Or could I ignore these and focus more on other stuff that might help?
---
I'll get one one day but only if I get a drop from something, not going to risk buying one.
---
Give people dumb quests, too. Lol.  
---
"Bring me 10 Teddy Fears, and I might just give you this legendary drill."
---
I hate it when couples wear matching outfits.
---
jk.
---
I love the game, sure it sometimes looks like a endless grind but I wanna play it more and more.
---
Windows 10 does not appear to be letting me set the mic to default
---

---
Omg fallout saved my life too!
---
This.
---
I run a max melee build, just a full BOS Heavy Combat Armor set, I use knives of various types depending on the enemy and a Super Sledge Heated with 40% swing increase for Mirelurks, Super Mutants, Death Claws and other harder foes.
---
With Adrenalin and maxed Melee perks I am effective but not invisible and definitely not OP. I see no reason to nerf melee to compensate for the PVP Bloodied Assassin/Sentinel or whatever griefers, I'm enjoying this build and game play I don't want to be penalised because of other's need to kill other players.
---
Seriously if melee gets nerfed I'm out, I'll still have had months of fun, but will just move on and call it a day.
---
Mine was set to just default and it wasn‚Äôt working  I had to go in and select audio input device and set that to my microphone I was using and that fixed it. If you audio input device is set to your mic then in ninsure why Fo76 isn‚Äôt picking it up 
---
I have suspected this as well.  Mainly because of the discrepancies in dates in the timeline.  According to the a Brotherhood of steel in a Fallout 3, vault 76 opened 20 years after the war.  But in this 'game' we are released 25 years later.
---
As this is not The Elder Scrolls, the lore in this universe is not subject to the 'unreliable' narrator that lore in TES is so fundamentally flawed with. 
---
Why? For pointing out something plainly obvious? Some people need to remove their rad-tinted glasses and stop pretending that FO76 lived upto its hype and legacy. 
---
Looks like I triggered a snowflake, but whatever dude. You do you.
---
I picked up a two shot cryolator after the last patch.
---
I won't say I like it more than New Vegas (my favorite) or the others, but I like it a lot, for what it is : a spin off, different from the other Fallout, who gives the opportunity to play differently (with friends, in a far more dangerous world).   
---
like Anthem, this game was released with real flaws but some players and journalists focused on the bad things, neglecting the fact that the game was still fun to play, and had good part too (coop, the possibility to change the world with future updates, some good stories for example).
---
I loved music and the birds singing, creepy as hell.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre triggered because people liked the game. Who‚Äôs the real snowflake here bud? 
---
yes, I saw.. but the only thing that kind of relates to any of this is... "Use items from your stash to decorate" which is vague to say the least, and flagging items for sale in a vending machine.. what isn't exactly what I meant when I said mention pre-loading trade menu. Thank you for bringing it to my attention though. 
---
If it is a simulation, the maker of the simulation must be aware of the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel. This would limit the potential time frame when the simulation could be created and the set of people with the necessary knowledge to a fairly small number.
---
 Most of Perception buffs Rifles and both it and Strength buff Shotguns. Mine are both over 10 with Strength almost maxxed. There are many less obvious perks that up Damage a lot. The Tank Killer 3 are almost essential for Rifle AP for instance.
---
Has happened to me atleast 10 times 
---
I'm sure they've upgraded to a jaz drive by now  ;)
---
I've seen nobody nuking prime lately. It's been disappointing
---
Yeah, but melee is so unbalanced that most of the time can kill you even with half damage...
---
I'm wondering what they are wearing underneath, his and hers sweaters O\_o
---
Me! Gambi91 I'm on pc 
---
I don't know why, but my mic keeps muting itself. 
---
Go to Sound - Recording - right click on My - Properties - Levels - change from 0 to 100. 
---
I see several problems with the theory:
---
* Data miners would have already found the odd text/animation.
---
* You can only launch every 3 hours, there are 9 sites (Prime and one site can overlap) so you need 3x3 = 9 hours on the same server without crashing or being booted. 
---
* Many nuke zones other than Prime and Whitesprings seem to crash more likely.
---
* It is likely the fissure sites reopen if a fresh player visits the area.
---
\- Wake up Mr. Freeman, wake up, and smell the ashes.
---
Bore off, the OP was about how people enjoy playing the game...the fact is a lot of us see through the 'lack of quality' aesthetic or NPC movements because the 'game play' is actually quite fun and rewarding.  WE dont need everything to look like RDR or Anthem for it to be enjoyable.
---
so... whats the method. lolol
---
Part of a group or lone wolf? 
---
I have to admit I was a little disappointed it didn't show at least in-game time. Why would I have a clock in my camp that keeps blinking 12:00?
---
 I have a set of BoS Heavy Combat myself, Dense on the chest and 3 Fireproof make me immune to explosions. I use it to hunt Scorchbeasts.
---
 For Melee I like my X0-1 and my Combat Knives. At night my 200% Repaired Nocturnal 40% Speed Serrated Combat Knife hits at about 180. It melts Ghouls at The Whitespring. I get in trouble for killing them too fast. ;)
---
They mentioned drinks that will give you elemental dmg to your range attacks
---
I had a nice guy come up, call me out on voice chat, and drop a bag for me with some maxed out level 5 armor and weapons. 
---
 
---
I felt a bit bad, because I wasn't a legit newbie. I had created another character just for fun.
---
But, huerobikerider, whoever you are - I'll have that armor and more ready to go for any low levels I come across (legit or not). &lt;3 
---
Oh no, it's the Pint Sized Slasher!
---
You see, the robots have... *issues*.
---
Someone killed my deathclaw ‚ÄúDanger Noodle‚Äù yesterday, been trying to find a new friend all day, nothing but pacify available :(
---
Ahh yes the fetch quests. Can't forget those lol
---
Oh one more thing! 
---
I have several perk cards maxed out. 
---
Can I delete tge remaining duplicates please. They're driving me insane. 
---
Unfortunately higher fps require much more powerful machine, maybe next generation consoles will be able to achieve that
---
Your revolver holds Six rounds, my fist never runs out of ammo
---
I forgot about this post and sorry for this very late reply. 
---
Just to clarify my situation, I live on a ranch far away from my small town here in the states. I‚Äôm lucky enough to get internet here as my neighbors on the other side of the hill I live on don‚Äôt even have the option besides satellite which has strict bandwidth, with most of them have to use hotspots on their phones. Me and my family had to trench, lay down pipe, and pull over 3000 feet of CAT 6 wire ourselves over a few months to the main road just so we could barely qualify to get connected to a provider. We have no other options to choose from  besides a very expensive satellite service that only offers 20gigs a month for my family of 5. 
---
Not everyone lives in the city and has the opportunity or access to 100mbs up and down.  There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with my PC as some of you have stated, we were promised 3mbs up and down but my download speeds never peak 500 kB/s. No joke. Been over it with our provider and it never could get resolved, and they know we are stuck with them because they are our only option. 
---
This is my family home which I doubt we‚Äôll leave for a long time , but until then me and like many others will most likely never get fast internet. It really did take me 2 days to download the original files and would have taken even longer to download the new update. Thankfully I had a good friend that lived in town and put the game on a portable hard drive so I could transfer it instead of the long wait for my download.
---
Sorry for the long comment but just to summarize not everyone is able to pull a fast one and download huge games in an hour or two. Think about it next time maybe when you start trashing on other people because we are most likely in a situation worse than yours.
---
Never mind, just tamed a dog. Seems I was unlucky until I asked for help lol
---
I'm so sorry about Danger Noodle.
---
There's a spot in the mire, above Abbie's Bunker and east of a fissure site, it's a lake with a crashed plane/vertibird in it, it's a random spawn location, I've been there 4 times looking for the ideal pet and found that 3 out of the 4 times there were tameable creatures, I found a level 24 Mirelurk Hunter (tameable), a level 1 Molerat (tameable) a Fluffles (tameable) and 5 level 50 Rabid Wolves (nukeable).
---
Sucks man, thanks for the reply tho, hopeful cross platform between Xbox and pc can reunite me with friends xD 
---
Oh nice, I just found a tameable wild mongrel on the road where train tracks cross near the treetops, so he‚Äôll be company enough for now, assuming je makes it to camp lol
---
Long story short vault Tec wanted to see what would happen if the best and the brightest were given access to unlimited nukes without the variable of other humans. If you don‚Äôt read the overseer terminal the robot gives us the holotape. Vault Tec wants us to know to go for the nukes from the get go. They leave a trail of bread crumbs even giving us access to an AI that  just gives us whatever we need for no other reason than he just wants to.  We are not he biggest and strongest but the smartest. They wanted to see if how we went about it and why.  Soon  vault Tec will release other humans to see how it will  change the results and how we use the unlimited supply of nukes. All while the overseer guides us by placing holotapes. Ever wonder why you can‚Äôt find her body any where? She isn‚Äôt in the simulation she is watching from the outside and guiding us as vault Tec instructed her.  It perfectly explains respawning, fast traveling, updates/ nerfs, and new content. All part of the long simulation. Also it‚Äôs why you never here of the scorch in all of the lore. It doesn‚Äôt exist. 
---
I realised this before I even considered doing the quest. I just untagged it and forgot about it. It's one for the achievement hunters only I feel.
---
People hop servers if they see all 3 silos have been used. I tend to launch 3 nukes and within a few hours, people simply leave and no new players arrive.
---
Also having a secret/easter egg implies Beth actually put in the effort and developed one, translated to all supported languages, coded the custom logic etc. They don't seem to do that a lot lately...
---
Yeah, if tameable creatures don't respawn they need to make a feature to save them, like down them and give you the option to Stimpak them, I would have gladly used a Stim on Fluffles if I had that option.
---
Before lunch they said there will be no cross play, but who knows maybe one day... I play on gaming laptop and can't imagine playing it on low fps myself
---
The main "thing" that makes melee so powerful is fallouts way of damage mitigation. Simply said the more damage u deal per hit the less damage mitigation. And melee is simply the best way to deal big numbers often. A good rolled knife can get to 150dmg with vfast attack speed, while guns with high attackspeed usual not even dealing a third of that.
---
When u online?
---
Exactly ^ 
---
to you that might be ‚Äòmiddle of the road‚Äô but to most people that‚Äôs light-speed
---
Yeah play it on my pc at smooth 60fps most maxed out, cross platform would be so beneficial for this game just hope they bring it in one day 
---
I play on 144 and now 60 seems a bit low for me it's so easy to get used to good stuff üòÖ
---
You can get the square 1 without legs, goes on tables etc
---
 Closest thing to it
---
I have a 144hz monitor but couldn‚Äôt find the setting the other day to change frame limit üòÇ thought everyone was locked at 60 I will definitely change tonight üòÇ what specs is your laptop man?
---
Well ‚ÄúCitizen Yips‚Äù is only level 3, so I dont expect him to last long
---
That's why I didn't tame that level 1 Molerat.  It also depends on where you live, I'm in the Mire so it can be kinda dangerous there.
---
I don't remember all specs but it's Predator i bought it mainly for fo76, it's big looks like a beast and I'm guessing for 2k¬£ they were able to put good stuff inside üòÇ
---
In the Italian Community we call these players "Ovetti" (little eggs), because they are like a kinder egg, when you break them you get a nice surprise.  
---
Sometimes with their loot you can craft ammo and repair armors and weapons for a few weeks.  
---
Did u use the exact same gun with the same level/mods/perks?
---
I don't agree at all. I hated the fact that you had to start over when playing surivival in Fallout 4. Of course you should be able to carry your character over from the different play modes.
---
Well....you are wearing a clown suit
---
No ALL Melee need substantial nerfs or readjustments.  The outrageous BS of Melee doing the kinds of damage levels in this game defy the laws of physics.  The amount of kinetic damage imparted on a target by ballistic weapons should far outweigh anything a human can do with mere strength and an edged weapon or via blunt force object.
---
I can help if you are on PC. Scam free..
---
Ohh right, makes sense. Just surprised after having killed probably 50+ regular SB that this was the first time I got any.
---
When they were in a party with my friend a little bit after the stream, they were apparently angry. 
---
Everyone can have an opinion. The people mad at you for yours are babies. But this is where the fan club is, so of course they will defend what they love. 
---
please go away
---
Well done.
---
... but you have wasted tons of time, resources, effort on mods that really wont give you anything.
---
You can kill 6 nuked ghouls in whitesprings for way more money, legendary items and xp.
---
That's why they put a rocket on it, duh. 
---
Weightless sentinel with chameleon mutation or assassin sentinel with stealth boy will cause you trouble.
---
I would pick 2 or 3 weapons max for the first 60 levels or so. YOu can always add more perks for other weapons as you get higher levels.
---
3 key Specials are Strength, Perception and Agility you want those all around 10-12, Charisma, Endurance I leave around 3 each and rest in Intelligence and Luck for crafting and mutations.
---
You then can play around with Melee (1h/2/h)and Shotguns in Strength tree; Rifles (auto and non-auto) in Perception; Pistols (auto/non) in Agility. Take 1 card in each of the weapon trees (ie 1 shotgunner, 1 expert shotgunner 1 master etc) as you get the most buff for mimimal investment but also allow you to spread your initial levels on other weapons and you can easily swap them out depending on what weapon you are favouring at the time.
---
But in all honesty, there is no right or wrong build,  unless you want to min/max your build and be soe ridiculously overpowered that the game is not a challenge, I would just play around with what you find fun.
---
For example, my current lvl58 melee build (since about level 40 actually) has out damaged my level 120 shotgun sniper build. 
---
Youtube and specifically "Youtubers" are cancer. Everything they do is for views and subscribers. Then people watch them because they have a lot of views and subscribers. It's easy to hate something, that's the easiest content you can make. So is misunderstanding and making up bullshit, or fake news, as it were. The most popular Youtubers could be absolutely full of shit but they appeal to their own authority on most any topic because they have the subscribers to do so and people will believe them.
---
Whats wrong with a weapon living up to its name?  Now its only good for grilling small bits of meat without the need for a campfire!  
---
Call it a utility weapon!
---
You may want the others as there is not a way to break down a perk card.  If you decide to change your build, you may need those spares.
---
I‚Äôm on pc too. Although I‚Äôm a noob to 76
---
I do the same but damn, I'm level 126 and I would love some more screws, an adhesive, and nuclear material, mostly just so I can make more mini nukes for my two shot fatman.
---
Yeah it would have some good specs at that price, if you ever wanna group Anarchyog is my in game name add me up if you ever wanna play 
---
Pff. . . Tell that to all the safes, lockboxes,  Chem boxes and first aid kits from before the war that you found in fallout 4.
---
Yep once 3 guys were shooting me with different explosive weapons and thx to fire proof and protocols nothing happened my HP didn't move.
---
If the door's unlocked, I figure it's free-for-all. Goldilocks the shit out of it. 
---
Also, I just have this thing where I love to see the insides of places. Locked CAMP doors hurt my heart. :'(
---
Sometimes, my build will have a locked bedroom (no peepin' when I'm sleepin'), but that's it. I only hope anyone who stumbles upon my base would make the most out of it.  
---
RNG drops are RNG. Sure, the health bug's a real pain, but they'll (probably) fix it.
---
Sounds like you wanted a reason to complain and on your Health issue, I agree.
---
If you're not hyped, cool. Neither am I tbh. I just want to see how it turns out.
---
But blaming one game, made by an offshoot company, and then using that as an excuse to not play other games made by the same Parent Company...
---
"Sins of the Father, eh?"
---
Play or don't. Whine or not. You do you.
---
With my two shot fatman?  Probably.
---
Better yet, prevent CAMPS from being attacked by players.
---
I was taking a particularly large dump! 
---
Well more often than not, this would have been a worse outcome.  I would say you got lucky is all.
---
And it has already been explained, every time this comes up, that it is completely unnecessary. You can just keep taking duplicates of the same card until you have 1 of each level. The system is designed to work this way. You cannot end up with duplicates of a given level, so you cannot accidentally a screw yourself either. 
---
Bethesda hasn't responded to this because the system is designed specifically to allow for flexibility, but you have to work for it by gaining extra levels. Of you could break down cards at will, it would undermine the way the system is now. 
---
I will, usually i play after work around 6:30am (working on night shift) and a bit more for weekends
---
Those are rookie numbers, get those number up
---
This is one of the few games where you can punch something and do three times the damage of a high energy propelled gause rifle.
---
&lt;shrug&gt; I guess they just want everyone to melee.
---

---
Not dying, but it's cute that you guys worry :) 
---
I still want a two shot flare gun, just to shoot the two flares in opposite directions and confuse people.
---
I run almost this exact same build, good stuff.....and to the OP, i can still get one shotted by other players, from a multitude of ranges. So i dont think guns are lacking. 
---
  Of course pvp people and griefers are using power fists or whatever now, and next week when the new patch and dlc comes out itll be something different for a week...balance has a lot of factors, and is a work in progress cause people are creative. PVP in this game litteraly comes down to who can land a hit first...whith whatever weapon theyre using....
---
My best guesses for entities running the simulation would be PAM or Eden. Both should have the necessary capacity for the simulation (what do you think PAM is running all the time you can't talk to her?) and the necessary background knowledge because of their origins.
---
For the most part absolutely. However there has been 6 occasion's where I have gotten power armor Plans from those lovely maps. So far I have AT45 left leg and left arm AT60 torso and AT51 left leg helmet and right arm
---
So ... a keycard with zero weight is difficult to carry?
---
All other materials are found inside the nuke site, you do not need to bring anything in.
---
It‚Äôs not really anything to do with that.
---
Me and my boyfriend do a lot of things on the game for fun rather than to benefit from it so it was a great accomplishment for us. :)
---
Wrecking one of two of those're are on my bucket list also.
---
Agreed.   They should not have flagged themselves.    Plus threaten a customer?  They should actually be apologizing to you.
---
nothing can kill u ,so why i wanna waste bullets?
---
Healing Factor?
---
Steam Snipe?  
---
yeah lets just make melee weapons uselss
---
...And daughter... and son.
---
You on rn ? Bout to get off won‚Äôt be on till later 
---
Agreed!
---
Booooooooo
---
I agree with you, melee is currently unbalanced with ranged. But we don't want anymore nerfing of anything, it really wouldn't go down well if that did that. Having just started a new melee character from a rifles build I was amazed at how quickly I could do 500+ damage and now I can start doing the OP bloodied stuff with the right weapons and perks. You can still do high damage with ranged builds, it just takes more effort.
---
But what can Bethesda do? Fundamentally in any Fallout game melee damage always increases with strength. The trade off for the high damage has always been you have to get close to your attacker. So maybe future PvE and PvP stuff will make melee less viable as  you'll get killed if you get too close. But that's another problem, death has little consequence in Fallout 76, which is why the bloodied builds do so well.
---
Perhaps Bethesda will realize that PVP does not actually work well in this game.
---
LOL.  You are probably right!  I bet the views on that one episode goes way beyond the other ones.
---
I decided to simply accept what the game wants me to accept. That it‚Äôs a post apocalyptic survival game and I can‚Äôt carry everything. I enjoy the challenge of needing to decide what is worth carrying.
---
Well the negative publicity will not come from being killed but by their threats against customers because of the action.
---
How else are you going to use that 3 star Rolling Pin you can't bake cookies with it.
---
Truth.  
---
Signed,
---
Not mad 
---
üòâ
---
It‚Äôs to farm flux. At this point in the game legendaries are easy to come by by normal means but flux is the new hot item brining in 100 caps a pop for violet and 50 for all others. 
---
I tend to wear a nurses outfit until I can find the witches outfit 
---
He wears the tattered mole outfit.
---
Or we sometimes spice things up and both wear spacesuits haha. 
---
Upvote for cancer bat. Just a beautiful word. 
---
Yeah some times I forget to equip it when farming super mutants for steel and I hardly notice the difference. 
---
Game balance &gt; Immersion.
---
If you have to make your way across a building to punch something in the face, it has to be better than the pistol-sniper that can be shot from across the room.
---
Here's my problem with that and apparently everybody uses this excuse now. It was NOT made by an offshoot of the parent company. Bethesda Game Studios, the same team that made Fallout 3 and 4 made/developed the game. All the Austin branch did (at first) was help to develop the engine to have online capability. Watch any interview and read it on Wikipedia. Why would Todd Howard be on any interviews of he had nothing to do qith it? The regular team made the game. However, it does seem that the Austin team has now taken over, because the regular BGS team is now focused on Starfield. I actually feel kind of bad for the Austin team taking all the flak.
---
I've not really ran into this regeneration health issue. I've had problems were my internet, the servers or both are lagging so clear shots don't land on my target. But never the health regeneration issue.
---
Mostly sexual. Note, they themselves do not fit into a straight jacket.
---
I highly doubt the friend  even work for Bethesda. Seems like something they‚Äôd say if they want to scare people. 
---
I killed my friend in 4 hits with a instegating deathclaw gauntlet. He was in PR, reactive plates, blocker, and life giver maxed. I'm not even a max damage build. First hit did 1.5k.
---
Just today I my friend was trying to spawn the random vendor at Charleston Station and found a camp there, but it was a really cool one so we decided to check it out and the owner was there, so we left our PS4 Party chat and joined Area Chat, turns out the guy had no idea his camp was affecting the vendor spawn, I warned him that someone would probably destroy his camp because of the location (which I'd consider if I encountered that after server hopping for a while) but this dude's camp was awesome and he was very nice, so I really don't want to see his camp destroyed.  You just gotta talk to people, unless their camp is both interferring and ugly, that's when the two shit fatman comes out.
---
Oh I see.  Well congrats!
---
Next goal = Scorched Beast Queen - At least you two will be well rewarded from that one compared to the 6 you just downed.
---
Xbox and ps4 legendaries seem to be worth less than those on pc, but you can probably sell it for like 1.5k caps
---
Maybe we're in Vault 112 and Stanislaus Braun is making us all his bitches. (Wouldn't explain the BoS or Enclave though.)
---
Working as intended :P
---
I've had a 20cap bounty on my head for two days for, I THINK, hitting a random guy who ran in front of me when fighting a legendary mob.
---
Finally yesterday a stranger walks into my camp and asks politely if he can collect the bounty as he needed the caps (he was lvl 22). I gave him 2k caps for his trouble, now I can see stuff on the map again :) 
---
Exactly.
---
Yeah, the real issue is not having perk loadouts. So we have to cycle through a hundred cards (exaggeration) to get to the one we want.
---
How is it OP? Doesn't the bloody effect require you to say at 20% and lower health for full effect?
---
The shishkebab is one of those weapons where when i look at the DMG im not sure if im missing something i dont know, like maybe it has mad fire damage or something. So its actually just so bad its useless? I mean its worse than the uselessness of the fatman.
---
Yeah for definite! 
---
Prime receiver plans, ultracite, +3 stat buff food. Ghouls mostly drop vendor trash which considering the vendor and stash limits is more of an inconvenience. Yeah you'll get more xp but unless you've a specific reason to level that's redundant.
---
For me, multiplayer games will always be better than single player games. That's really all 76 has going for me.
---
76 can very easily become my favorite Fallout if they put out the content.
---
The survival genre is nothing new to me, and surviving in this game is rather trivial as is the base building and looting. If those things are the highlights of the game for you, than I'm happy for you.
---
New Vegas will remain my favorite Fallout for now.
---
If they can really push out the content, such as the faction interactions they've talked about, and bring in stuff from older fallout games (without fucking with what has been set as precedent \*too\* badly) then this game could grow into something really good.
---
are you ok?
---
I agree. They shouldnt nerf melee but buff ranged. Buff base damage of range weapons and let perception increase ranged damage would be a good start.
---
This is par for the course in Fallout 76.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox, you should come with us one day! 
---

"See anything wrong here..."
---
Yes, your times seem to very exact
---
Yup, we need this. Pls?
---
My shotgun character with no melee perks started using a fire axe to conserve ammo. It is so much faster, doesnt miss either really unlike most first vats shots. 
---
Was in a nuke Whitespring last night and had to bring the shotgun back out so as to tag and not kill. 
---
Melee is far easier right now. It could maybe take a slight reduction. Biggest add for guns would be VATs not missing the first shot chronically even at 95. Second would be a damage increase on the base of many, durability increase on some as well. I think my lasers last longer when I bash than when I pull the trigger.
---
Isn't it just a bunch of steel to make?
---
yep - got a prime receiver from killing a level 80 SB
---
\^Yup, I'm a Morgantown resident and former university student.
---
Not at the moment, I'll be on around 5 EST tonight though

---
Same I‚Äôm yet to notice anything with this perk. 
---
An interesting read, thanks for the link.
---
We do matching mechanic outfits and miner helmets üòé
---
Fuck yes.  In the knees with my shotty, then run away.
---
No, I'm admitted they were rough estimates. Read again? 
---
&gt; invisible
---
Invincible?
---
I have had it happen a few times. The lvl 80 beasts seem to have a higher drop chance, imo.
---
&gt; doesnt miss either really unlike most first vats shots. 
---
You're shooting too fast, VATS takes a moment to work out the odds.
---
Scrapper is one of the many perks I think need a buff. It's too underwhelming there's honestly no reason to even get it sadly.
---
No, what everyone is complaining about are the parasites that place their turret camps directly behind the whitesprings clubhouse to farm all the ghouls. 
---
I'm sorry but yes they fucking do, you can't claim something and then not back it up, ya fucking knobgoblin. 
---
If you unlocked the polished metal mod and can't find it on metal arms, legs or chest, then it's for the metal helmet.
---
I agree with this. Because having 6+ of the same card when it only maxes out at 3 with some requiring up to 5. But having to cycle through duplicates of cards all the tire is so troublesome.   
---
Allow us to delete the cards or add a "favorite" category for cards allowing us to favorite ones we would actually want to use. 
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
They could simply come up with a different name and they'd be safe from the lore police...
---
In Fallout Tactics there is a consumable called After Burner Gum which basically has the same effect as Jet. An experimental chewing gum laced with methamphetamine tested by the military would perfectly fit into the game.
---
Ill do it tonight for 100 caps
---
Ah lead not steel. Yea they should swap that to steel.
---
On PS4 it has yet to crash on me in a long time 
---
I hate that backpacks are so far away, that's what I'm most excited about 
---
Completely agree. Melee is way over powered and shotguns and rifles are underpowered, especially since the TSE nerf. Which I know was over powered, but they completely killed it. 
---
On second thoughts.... was it over powered? My tse handmade still took a few hits to kill a player, when melee could 1 shot. And we all know most pvp initiates at close quarters. 
---
Incisor means melee ignores 75% or targets armour.
---
Where tank killer means rifles ignores only 36% of targets armour.
---
Shotgunners don‚Äôt even have a perk card anti armour.
---
I feel like I‚Äôm being forced to use melee. 
---
It would be nice for it to at least be on par with the deathclaw gauntlet instead of the security baton.
---
I have also thought they missed a hilarous chance by not having the meat from something killed by it come out cooked, not raw.
---
Which Platform? Works well enough for me on PC; very rarely I get CTD or GUI hangs after several hours of grind.
---
Who *doesn't* need a metal bucket?  Steel is my limiting resource these days.
---
I know man. This is the issue. Couple this with the illusion of choice you get in the game, where to be able to keep up you need specific perks and mutations, running specific weapons with specific legendary effects and GOD HELP ME if that weapon is a shotgun because unless its TSE, your never killing the scorch beast queen. Thats like fighting a dragon witha wood sword in skyrim.
---
When you stop running out üòâüòú
---
Lol tbf thats a completely wild guess, I have no idea how many I've killed but it probably is more than that. Normally I ignore them half the time though because their loot just isnt worth the time and resources spent so that's why I'm guessing at a low range.
---
Nice one! Now it's time to run around and spook their nests so you can fight multiple scorch beasts. That's what I do now gather 4-5 kill their troops while waiting for them to land, ( I'm a melee build ).
---
WTF is "Halidoms"?
---
"(archaic) A sanctuary; lands held of a religious foundation. "
---
Fucking hell.
---
Same
---
Ranged needs a stat like STR that steadily increases damage as you stack it. As a melee build it's fun to get another item with +STR and see your damage tick up. 
---
The closest thing ranged has is LCK for building crits faster. Except melee also can use crits and the breaking points (number of shots needed per crit) are extreme and offer little incremental progress.
---
Personally, I think loot needs to be overhauled massively to allow for random stat rolls on items other than set legendary effects. I want stuff like increase dmg by x-y amount or lower AP cost by x-y amount. I just want a reason to hunt for incrementally improving drops and look for better rolls on stuff. Legendary effects feel way too "all or nothing".
---
Ohhhhhhh. Do I also need to kill a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Wendigo, not a Glowing One?
---
Oh nice, now bloodied builds and sentinel armor equals griefing! The use of this word in this sub is just pathetic....
---
I believe people just use melee because its just so easy to maintain and not have to worry about ammo all the time. I see this talked about a lot but ranged weapons aren't as bad as people think they are lmao. Abuse sneak multipliers and you can literally one shot things with guns if you fix your character up enough. "There isn't anything that increases ranged damage" There actually is, but people just overlook them. There are items that increase CRIT DAMAGE which absolutely works with ranged weapons, there are bobbleheads, . Look for new ways to make yourself more powerful, it's not too difficult. Maybe try a vats/crit build I've been wanting to try that because it seems really  good with four leaf clover.   
---
building a camp facing inward toward the windows/doors of the gold club are intentionally trying to screw with other people.   They deserve to get wrecked regardless of level.
---
Now with the hidden spawn points, sure its understandable.
---
I used the pip boy app for FO4 on my iPad. I gotta say, it really immersed me into the game. The ability to fast travel by tapping on the screen, radio stations, changing weapon loadouts, and inventory management... yes, I want this on 76. 
---
Love the world and the random 99 % positive meetings with other wanderes just keeps me coming back as often as I can play. 
---
&gt;  they drop pretty good quantities of black titanium which is otherwise pretty rare
---
Mole miners are rare?
---
True enough, but at least you get a miniscule chance of getting a better legendary.  With farming SBs you get no chance.
---
Playing on PC. It's very, very poorly optimized. It is using 75% of my CPU, and makes my fan run like fucking crazy. I have a 1400$ MSI gaming laptop with a powerful intercooler under it. I also have the game on bare minimum graphics settings. 
---
I wore power armor over my clown suit and hat and it didn't trigger. :(
---
Unyielding armor works well with rifles, pistols, and other guns. So does nerd rage and adrenal reaction (when it works).
---
My revolver has 24 rounds quad barrel baby. 
---
Same. I‚Äôve never really had an issue on PS4. 
---
I noticed this especially yesterday and the day before. Everything took ages, loading screens, enemy spawns, loot tables, kinda everything to be honest. I thought it was strange, because I felt everything was super smooth after the last patch.
---
Hummm, i think maybe you should add some Luck Perks in your real life...
---
Tune into Grafton radio for that one
---
I'd say it could use a buff but as far as I'm concerned it's incredibly useful which is why I always have it equipped, if you pick up weapon and aromor piece you can get a lot, so it seems to work best if you're a kleptomaniac like me in 76.
---
A similar story for me and I completely agree
---
&gt; See anything wrong here with this typical play experience? 
---
Yeah, you are eating lunch really early.
---
Also, that's not what I'd call typical.
---
They should of ended the post with the grind is Priceless for everything else there is Mastercard.
---
That's not passive aggressive, it's just aggressive.
---
I let others drop nukes in Whitesprings and get tons of fluid and mass, then drop my own nuke later in the area that has lots of the flux I want. 
---
The experience is the reward my friend. Now you have a tale to tell for the ages.
---
Yup!  Got the rusty knuckles plan from a lvl 50 near Huntersville a month ago 
---
I don't feel bad for them.  They get paid sweet Bethesda dollars. 
---
Just submit a ticket.  I got a refund for something that wasn't what I thought. 
---
Why not both? The balance team isn't working on camp functionality and vice versa. This is an entire studio working on one game, not one guy who has to make choices on what to work on next.
---
On a related note, I believe the legendary effect that passively increases VATS hit chance at all times also seems broken. It doesn't seem to do anything at all.
---
But only if it hits the She-Shed, Sheryl. 
---
I love my melee build, but trying to walk in on a TSE or AAE for pvp will ruin your day.
---
I have been bloodied sniped enough to think melee is not OP, at least in a pvp sense.
---
Besides, who else is gonna stand in front of the SQ, taking her love taps while you shoot away?
---
I want to say that I found something in the Pioneer scout camp in the middle of the toxic rally but it's been so long
---
How did you get that wendigo to wear a clown costume ;)
---
I think I have set up camp at almost every junk node in the game at this point! \^\_\^ There was always something about each location that bothered me though and I decided to pack up and move on.  
---
Right now I'm just East of Vault 76 on a cliff above the Gorge Junkyard. It has a steel node, a copper node and a **serious** amount of flat space! Really! I've managed to build a respectable little farm there in advance of Brewing and Distilling and hope to set up shop soon!  
---
As a bonus, the mobs level isn't anything to trouble the missile turret at either end of the camp, although I must admit that the occasional sudden burst of explosions does scare the crap out of me! xD
---
This game still isn't up to spec enough to add the content that was assured was coming.
---
Thank God the atom shop gets updated every other day. /s
---
Chally deserves a moderator position and lots of green stuff.
---
I think I would get rid of that hunting rifle, seems to have a defect.
---
You didn't say where you are located.  Amazon has regional server clusters.
---
I haven't seen any problems in Western Europe.  (My internet connection is 1Gbps fibre though).
---
Really wish they had something like the pipboy app for this game. 
---
Purposefully hunting down and killing live-streaming players, often by using the stream as a way to pinpoint the streamer's location, making it more difficult for them to avoid being "sniped".
---
I sincerely hope they add this whenever they add in Vaults as proper group dungeons. I really want to play them, but I really doubt I'll be able to convince my friends to come back and play when that content gets released. Being able to have some kind of matchmaking for these group activities seems crucial.
---
I don‚Äôt ;-; they came to my camp 
---
PS4 is very good at being optimized. I played it on PS4 for a while before with no issues. It seems like the PC has so many more serious issues. 
---
My thoughts exactly. 
---
This game is very, very different from WoW. There you have a little more than 24 people to engage with on your server.  I hear your concerns but I think in this particular game that matchmaking would *encourage* others to socialize and make new friends. 
---
He means it's not the time and place, i.e. this heartfelt thread, to be airing your grievances or making suggestions.
---
It runs out of AP instead.
---
You're not very good at physics. It's not like your average bullet hits **so** much harder than a sledge hammer swing, it's that the force is concentrated in a much smaller area. Until you know what you're talking about, keep the conversation in topics you do understand.
---
I mean think about it, you experience **all** the force a bullet has behind it when you shoot a gun. Now imagine catching a sledge hammer in full swing. The gun you can handle, the sledgehammer will break your arms.
---
Of course, all those of faith are welcome at his shrine. May his iridescent glow bathe all of you in his warmth.  
---

---
I really didn‚Äôt expect them to have those, is there a time limit?
---
Wait, did they confirm they are working on cross platform between pc and xbox one? 
---
It's not just trapper. It's any piece of gear with the rad resist perk. 
---
Ditto
---
No, no confirmation but it would be so good for the game 
---
Ranged damaged based on P sounds good to me, my old lever action rifle could come back out of the stash box :-)
---
I think there dont have to be ranged people at AQ since it goes like 10 times faster with melee only. ;)
---
Ugh what a toxic response.  
---
Bethesda's games are getting worse. Absolutely amazing was perhaps Morrowind and Fallout 3. And Bethesda as a company is getting worse with its practices.  
---
With your appreciation for such unprofessional behavior, lying to fans and paying customers, and all in all doing absolutely the worst both on technical level and on managing level, you are basically ruining future games for everyone. It is because of fanboys like you, that suffer from lack of critical thinking that the game industry is turning so bad.
---
Games are the break from reality that most of us need. I don't mean that we need to escape into fantasy, I mean that we sometimes need to be in a world where we can control where we go and what we do; where our hard work is often rewarded; where we can solve problems in a logical fashion - all things that 'reality' too often sadly lacks :) Really glad you're enjoying the game!
---
I had a shit ton of issues on Xbox. Moved to pc about 3 weeks ago and I've crashed maybe twice and disconnected once. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
A sledgehammer will produce more force than almost any bullet and since we're talking about kinetic damage, more force = more kinetic damage. A bullet simply has a much higher force per impact area than the sledge and so it can penetrate. Taking that into consideration, the sledge imparts more kinetic energy into its target than the bullet because the target absorbs the sledge swing whilst the bullet may go through the target. If it does go through, the kinetic energy isn't all transferred. 
---
That isn't to say the bullet will absolutely cause less damage because it can penetrate to vital and fragile organs. But going with the phrase the guy above you used, well he said it very poorly and completely incorrect.
---
Ah, I agree with you there; fallout 76 has fractured what me and my friends play (it's like a 50/50 split between PC and Xbox one) it really sucks.
---
I know there was a interaction where herb/carn prevent serums from working because of how they handle food items. It thought it was fixed but there is a chance it still exists.
---
Damn it lol, do you know if it's a bug with the limb or the roll? I haven't got enough pieces to check atm. I was aiming to run trapper in a nuke zone and have them all with rad resist but if 2 of the limbs are bugged there's no point
---
So that's why all the super mutants I was fighting the other day turned purple...I was thinking WTH then I saw it and died..lol. I came back and wiped them all out with alittle help from some chems. That little monster is evil 
---
That‚Äôs odd 
---
Tbh - on your first play through I would not worry about a 'build' at all. Just go with whatever perks are most useful or fun at your level. By the time you hit the gear cap at level 50 the game is so easy that it is perfectly playable with any random perk selection. You can refine a build after that.
---
It's a regular fireman's outfit, which is property set up in the files but for whatever reason doesn't show up anywhere.
---
/u/ladydevann, could you possibly ask around about having the outfit fully implemented into the game (along with maybe having the chance for event-only outfits dropping increased)? 
---
Same chance as just wandering around the map. The only consistant reason to farm Whitespring is when nuked for flux mats. I've got 5 chars above level 100 that all have decent legendaries and I don't think any came from ghouls. Anyhoo, my real point is there's a lot more to enjoy in this game than running in circles seeing who has the highest level/best gun which I'm sure is what the op was getting at too.
---
Honestly this looks like you‚Äôre lying or you‚Äôre the unluckiest FO76 player I‚Äôve seen on this subreddit. This looks like a compilation of all the recent complaints of this subreddit into a story to get karma. I play on PS4 and I haven‚Äôt had any crash issues back to back like this and I can steadily have my game be running until I don‚Äôt feel like playing which is hours upon hours in. With the crashing instances back to back within a matter of 10 minutes it could‚Äôve been you this entire time instead of the game if proven to be real. I‚Äôve had a handful of occasions where people are breaking my camp but this was because I was stationed right on the golf course of Whitesprings next to the bridge. Maybe pick a better CAMP location instead of complaining about PVP mechanics (also a popular and justified complaint). The bad scripting of the scorchbeasts is an overused  karma gimmick and is getting old and it sounds rather fake in your scenario where 3 of them flew around Whitesprings and not one was killed. The rocket turrets behind the golf club was literally ripped from other people‚Äôs complaints (I‚Äôve only seen a turret camp behind Whitesprings once and it was months ago) including the SBQ loot run. Didn‚Äôt you think to get a screenshot of the never ending loading loot screen on the SBQ because this is one of the most complained about and faked bugs in the game. Provide some proof or this story is BS. If you took the time out of your day to offer this step by step planner of your day you would‚Äôve at least taken the time to screenshot the turrets and the 3 scorchbeasts or anything to back this up or the never ending SBQ loot loading. Prove me wrong OP.
---
Ok, maybe it's not Beth Austin to blame.
---
But, saying they'll never play another Beth Game, all because of one bug and RNG, seems a bit... Dramatic, to me at least.
---
I do appreciate the correction.
---
Same I kill them just I don‚Äôt get annoyed with their minions lol
---
That‚Äôs the way to do it
---
How much RAM do you have? I run the game on 3 machines: 
---
* Desktop i7 4770k -16GB RAM - GTX 1060: some hiccups, some crashes
---
* Desktop i7 8700 - 32GB RAM - GTX 1060: smooth, some rare crashes
---
* Laptop i5 6440 - 8 GB RAM - Radeon M370: very low settings, 640x400, 20 FPS in general, stable
---
The game loves more RAM.
---
You win the game at 10/10.
---
Ok,i will give you 1k cap add my psn.
---
You on xbox?
---
That set of paintjobs was incredible.  Would seriously pay real money in the Atom shop to get some of that stuff in 76.
---
Got it thx bud
---
Depends on if you bought it from the Atom shop my dude
---
?
---
I got the "Reward" but its still there as a challenge! Gaaah!!
---
Budum Tssssss!! Well played sir...well played.
---
Meanwhile his buddy is like "DA hell you doing shooooooot!!!!!"
---
sounds like you just need to put the  game down and poay something else. 
---
No it doesn't. U can also just have 40% health and it increases damage by 200%
---
You realize this was in relation to the daily quests yeah?
---
Wont work with the power armour, normal armour with the clown suit will
---
I would like a single update with changes to chainsaw weapons, laser weapons, but now I would add also the shishkebab. You're absolutely right.
---
Lol if I had people to play with daily I would 
---
You realize this post was in relation to daily challenges asking folks to get nude, take photos, and team up yeah?
---
I would think that you are not alone on that one :) 
---
Yeah, same here got a group of friends I would love to run with but they‚Äôre on Xbox 
---
I'm sorry but if you need 32GB of RAM to run this game then that is fucking insane.. 
---
If you see your pet die or are very lucky you can quickly log out and it can bring them back. I think they need passive mode or something, if the best pets in the game are all lvl 1 how are we supposed to keep them alive. Slightly annoying :) my friend found a house cat the other day but he lasted maybe two hours in game, in a low level area with a fortress around him
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwGQFzs7o6Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwGQFzs7o6Y) :D :D :D
---
Yeah that was the point, we play to have fun. Even though he does get really frustrated when I get to a higher level than him. 
---
Congrats!
---
My brother plays a melee and I play a ranged build, so when the beast is in the air he takes care of all the spawned scorched while I shoot at the wings to try and bring it to land (don't know if it's even a thing, oh well). When it does, he charges in and I take care of any spawned mobs.
---
How do you do it safely? Just use someone you trust as the in-between?
---
Yeah, honestly I'd have rather Fluffle ran from the Scorched if it would have kept him safe, my build sucks solo but I can still take out a level 50 Scorched Beast and her Scorched.
---
Shotgun shells and 5.56 always seem to be in demand but I don‚Äôt know if anyone would pay a full cap each. It‚Äôll depend on how you can price them. 
---
You can always go on the market subreddit and off them up there. Shells seem to go for around .5-.7 caps per and people will buy in bulk. 
---
You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. Shut up back there! And what's wrong with him, huh? Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us? I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits. No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening. Hey, what village are you from, horse thief? Why do you care? A Nord's last thoughts should be of home. Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.
---
...looks like the Thalmor are with him.
---
General Tullius, sir. The headsman is waiting. Good. Let's get this over with! Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me. Look at him. General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.
---
Why are we stopping? Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.
---
How could you even do that i got a lvl 70  with wich if done basically everything+  a lvl 26 when i stopped playing because the quests/story are so weak 
---
It's to eliminate the time between launch and the detonation where you need to clear up your inv, repair gear, maybe grab more supplies etc.
---
I don't use a base unless the owner is present and even then I ask permission :p don't want the wrong idea
---
Need a silencer added to a lever action and bird bones and couple of other mutations.  I'll be on around 5pm EST.  
---
I bought ammo when i first started out, but then you quickly realise it is cheaper to either craft it or just find it. I dump hundreds of bullets of all flavours everyday other than shotgun shells that i use into the nearest bins and suitcases at vendors, along with tons of chems that i pick up and never use. 
---
Totally! Run fool! Haha :) 
---
Watoga School has 'nothing is real' message too.
---
Lol it's not a competition.
---
You're winning though üòÇ
---
Incidently you know batbrains give +3int which means more xp? Might help him out.
---
Considering he ran away from a Brahmin and an Angler on our way to my camp, bit attacked the three Wendigos and the Hermit Crab...and my friends, he had some odd fears.
---
this would explain why I respawn when I die...
---
TSE is really as hype as it seems. I finally got my hands on a TSE lever action and I can testify that my quad lever puts in more work than the TSE one. 
---
It‚Äôs all fluff at the end of the day and not to mention it‚Äôs a choice to play that way. I‚Äôve used my TSE to fight SBQ twice and I did better without it. 
---
Also I‚Äôve seen some non meta people so much better without following it.
---
Moving your camp around inside the camp area will make you pet move too, good to experiment and try to get them inside :) 
---
I agree üëç
---
Me too. That's why I HATE how restrictive Bethesda is with camp placement (and other building rules for that matter). Its like they hate fun. 
---
I hear u have to be close by your camp in order to tame
---
30 year old spoiler alert....all the Fallouts are simulations 
---
Turret camps inconveniences others. 
---
Doubt that would work for me, my camps are usually built to a specific location and most of my areas were elevated off the ground since I build around/above a river.
---
Server hopping is the only efficient way to get legendaries. If BGS had made a better system, we wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with the issue. But they didn‚Äôt, and still haven‚Äôt done anything towards fixing it, so we‚Äôll have to see if server hopping just follows this game for its lifetime.
---
I agree. There isn‚Äôt a need for turret bases just like there isn‚Äôt a need for server hopping mad men. If you clear the white springs of Ghouls from one end to another they generally spawn back at the other end in a short amount of time. It‚Äôs probably a better method of farming then server hopping cause you don‚Äôt have to sit in loading screens
---
I hadn't thought of that. I actually built a giant concrete castle in fo4 after repairing the walls. Wish you could do something on that scale here. 
---
Just to clarify it's the melee weapons that aren't realistic, not the fact you live in Chernobyl 2; radiation boogaloo and have super mutants and lovecraft mudkips for neighbours
---
I‚Äôm new to this stuff. What does ‚Äúhaving just started a Melee character from a rifle build mean‚Äù? 
---
At least someone server hopping isn't stealing other people's spawns. 
---
Yeah. I buy ammo from vendors because I‚Äôm always hitting the cap limit and have nothing else to buy, so I figure I‚Äôll buy some instead of making it. 
---
I get almost double steel with scrapping heavy weapons
---
I normally just give it away to lower level players
---
Cool. I work in Boston, so I loved having the connections in fo4
---
It‚Äôs an interesting comparison. I guess the difference for me as a hopper is I have to ‚Äòdo the work‚Äô while hopping and clearing the area (time investment, ammo, aid) while getting both experience and items. Turret camps rely on others respawning the area for them, then ‚Äòtake‚Äô the mobs from someone that was anticipating them showing up when they generate them. 
---
In short, the turret camps seem a bit lazier IMO
---
That would be a great little location for a player vendor when that update hits! Nice build :)
---
There's a trick to placing it. You have to open the camp at the far end of the bridge and walk it in, otherwise it's red. 
---
Whitesprings and scirchbeast grind
---
Many a true nerd done a good video about this too
---
This is due to reload times and action point drain. 
---
PvP and pve they're awesome but against the queen a bit meh.
---
Their previous character was specialized in rifles, and the new one is melee-based. :)
---
&gt; You tube it... there are several locations but I go to Pickett‚Äôs fort. It‚Äôs a random spawn location so be prepared to hop
---
Thank you for the tip
---
Fair enough. It IS very different.
---
Let‚Äôs hope they never implement it OR implement it in a way that doesn‚Äôt obsolete being a nice person. 
---
To be successful and competitive you need a build that matches your play style.
---
If you get flustered when you're surrounded and are more comfortable engaging at a distance, you won't hold a candle to someone who likes being upclose and personal with a mirelurk queen, no matterhow good your melee build is.
---
And visa versa, a vats sniper will be boring for someone who wants that in your face action. 
---
There are lots like you. I escape to this world too, among others, I read a lot too, fantasy genre, to escape reality. This game for me is stress free time, almost borrowed time, I look up now and again to realise that 2 hours have flown by instead of 5 minutes! I'm lucky enough to have a room dedicated to gaming and to all that I love, it's only 1.2m by 3m, but it's my place to escape. It may not be a perfect game, but I'm a Bethesda fan, having played all their games. So I take it, faults and all, and love it.
---
It would be nice now that they removed gatling guns from getting any benefit from Martial Arts, if they added that fire rate improvement back to another perk like Bear Arms to compensate.
---
It doesn't make sense for stats to increase damage of ranged weapons, but there's no reason it shouldn't provide some benefit like a fire rate increase from being able to crank the gun faster, or reload speed increase (would be big for black powder weapons for eg.).
---
You could add it for other weapons too - the rationale being stats help the ranged person cock the trigger faster, reload faster, etc - so its a different way to increase damage output.
---
No not necessarily, it depends on how it is used, but that build type IS used for griefing and it gets tired reading posts complaining about melee being OP, again it depends on how it's used.
---
No one would care if an OP build was killing critters faster than they can, because unless you're in their team you'de never know anyway. It *is* because players are using game mechanics to grief other players, often of a lower level than they are because they need to dominate in the game. They don't play Fallout 76 like a Fallout game and are bringing mechanic exploits methods from other games.
---
You maybe don't like melee because you play a Bloodied/Sentinel *whatever* build to dominate other players for your e-peen boost. I play the game solo because I love the Fallout world and enjoy battling myself against the critters and environment experimenting with my build of choice, melee, some sniping with sneak multiplayer bonus. 
---
I hope my fun is not killed because of others e-PVP-een.
---
It‚Äôs plausible that the bos have lost information about Appalachia in the time since fo76 and pre fo3. Not to mention. The enclave could have on their way from the west to east swooped in and cleaned the area out messing up records of our time there. 
---
Also I think the computer that we have in fo3 is getting its information from a Vault-Tec source. If you think out it why would they release info about a land with automated nuke silos that they had a hand in securing many years ago. 
---
Which is really lame, because the feel and look of Heavy Guns (like a .50 Cal) is amazing. Check out the LMG too, it looks like it should reduce everything to a fine red mist, but it does all the damage of a wet fart. 
---
Everytime I deposit in the stash I make sure the item is in before I continue, this kind of stuff only really happens when the server is getting long in the tooth. 
---
I know it should "just work" but sometimes you have to be super aware of what's going on while you are stashing or dropping items. I'm certain lag is reposible for a lot of missing items as you can drop things without realising when the game isn't keeping up. 
---
At 700 hours in you should be pretty aware how the game can get and as you found, Bethesda won't always help in these situations. As a result (somewhat unfairly) the onus is on us to be extra vigilant when dealing with inventory. 
---
&gt;In the event we get a junk jet I‚Äôm using it to fire flaming cash at people.
---
 As well? Amazing !! 
---
{insert Gandolf meme}
---
We can do that?
---
u/ladydevann
---
Yeah I definitely see where you‚Äôre coming from. Perhaps they could let people queue onto servers that are tagged with descriptive keywords or something; let people who prefer to play cooperatively choose to join a server with others interested in the same. It won‚Äôt automatically put anyone in a team, though, because stumbling upon others and helping them out is a huge part of what makes this game feel special. 
---
Definitely not a fleshed out idea, but I do agree that just putting people into teams would disrupt the post-apocalyptic atmosphere a bit too much. 
---
Idk man. Anything is better than an instigating auto combat rifle.
---
r/almostbeetlejuicing 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
&gt;Rubber banding
---
Happens at Whitesprings for me, when entering from outside or changing zone between the bunker. I usually wait a bit and see if my AP regens back or not. If it doesn't, the server hasn't finished loading and I get rubber banded back. Not a biggie for me.
---
&gt;PvP exploits
---
Could be, have no experience with them. I don't PvP or get challenged pretty much at all, don't use Reactive Plates or mutations you mentioned either. My camp is unremarkable.
---
&gt;Overweight mules get attacked immediately
---
Probably a feature to get rid of hoarders and potential dupers in a plausible deniable way. Junk you lose but you are forced to drop all the other items by yourself. Also now you have a hard cap at 1.5k + change so can't really test this with fresh characters.
---
So do hoppers who spawn in, run in the golf club and LEEROY JENKINS the whole place hehe 
---
About the chainsaw weapons: I haven't tried a chainsaw yet, but I have used a Ripper, so I would expect the chainsaw to work in a similar way. 
---
Essentially, the Ripper is like a "full auto knife" - it does a little bit of damage many many times. This means that you run into similar problems as with many of the automatic firearms. On the one hand, it does too little damage per attack to properly overcome the enemy's damage resistance. On the other hand it seems like the game engine frequently has difficulty keeping up with hit detection, and the faster you hit, the more often your hits fail to register. 
---
That's why slow melee weapons are better on average than fast or medium melee weapons, and why firearms tend to do better the slower rate of fire they have. They may have similar DPS, but they do more of their damage per hit, thereby overcoming more damage resistance and having less risk of the game forgetting about the hits. 
---
As for energy weapons, particularly laser... I have no idea why they are so weak. That's just weird. 
---
I was thinking that for shotgun shells, plasma cores, gamma rounds, 40mm etc I would just set it to 1 cap and if it will let you set something to 0 caps then maybe dump the .308 .38 and 10mm in free for anyone who needs it rather than it going to waste or popping it into a train station suitcase and not knowing whether anyone had use of it or not. Stash space is always precious though so I thought I‚Äôd check out the demand before I start filling my pockets and stash lol
---
I‚Äôm getting tired of having to hop for a ‚Äúclean run‚Äù but what ya gonna do
---
I'd guess the campers would state the exact same argument as you do though, you're both attempting to achieve the same goal. 
---
Most people make their stories the typical " watched parents get killed " or " from abusive family " or " half mutant " so Nice job

I can‚Äôt get them in my actual house but I can move them around to get the ‚Äúsafest‚Äùspot possible haha but lots of my friends have made it work.

---
Pretty much this, I hate the rocket camps myself but find hoppers pretty rude and annoying too. 
---
I was under the impression that was patched but no matter I don't use normal rad x. 
---
Find the clean server and stay in it? 
---
Say what you want about server hopping, but if I catch a CAMP behind the clubhouse with turrets, I will level it every si gel time. Every. Single. Time.
---
So you are saying the game would be better if I had friends?  Just kidding, I have struggled to stay interested in it but I am glad you are enjoying it. I am holding out in hope of a free DLC that adds what I find to be missing. 
---
I only use 5.56 but do collect all the ammo I see.   I drop off all that extra ammo at Vault 76 onto the Responder corpse to the right of the vault when you first exit it.
---
Why anyone would buy ammo when it is so easy to craft for yourself is beyond me but I certainly cannot rule it out. 
---
They are when I spawned the club and they just run in with no comprehension of how to make sure everyone gets a piece of the action. 
---
Do you have any hard data to back that up?
---
But those who spawn in bring with them more ghouls, each of which has a chance of dropping a 3* radium rifle.  
---
What else do I do with my suppressed shotgun that has a paper range of... 8.
---
It‚Äôs really stupid that a super sledge can do just about as much damage as a mini nuke.  We all know energy weapons are basically useless so the next best thing is to load up and perk up the shotgun build.  
---
I have mutant axe with speed element and it does a crapload of damage which is great in tight quarters around mobs.  Same thing with my modded Tesla.  
---
But I have to admit - I like shooting stuff.  
---
Ok man.
---
The worst are the camps and the person isn't even there. 
---
My not so favourite is when I get lazy and hang out at a claimed Workshop standing about and become insta-dead from a shot in the back from the immutable sneaky TSE, the sound of those I hate almost as much as those MoleRats ass raping me for the millionth time.
---
I love my heavy BOS set, though need my T-51b if I'm going to suck up too many rads, I try to just wait until I can get to a decon Arch, PA is so clumping.
---
It's definitely a cool spot
---
What sorcery is this?
---
Thanks for the reply I hadn‚Äôt thought about anyone looking to off load caps on ammo, must admit though I rarely hit the limit before I end up spending them on something frivolous lol
---
We need that the slap damage limited as "once for another player for current session".. otherwise some d.bag melee players can be pretty trouble!
---
Prior to the nerf a over a month ago I had an explosive 50 cal and that was fun.  Go to farm ghouls at WS and it was a turkey shoot.  I still have a trusty and reliable anti armor 50 cal, but I only take it out if griefed by those in PA or to use against the SBQ.  Make heavy weapons great again!! 
---
This goes for A LOT of weapons to be honest. I wanted to do a gunslinger build, using revolvers and such, Single Action (unusable), my two shot Western Revolver (unusable since the TS nerf). I just wanna use revolvers Bethesda ;_; why won't you let me???
---
And by unusable I mean really difficult to use on enemies above level 50, I'm level 200ish and it works well on even lvl 68 Scorched... If I go for headshots, but other than that I'd have to waste so much ammo and almost break my gun to take out a squad of muties.
---
Turrets are lazemy, hoppers are greedy, would be my interpretation. I sometimes farm WS with a team and with no camp out the back. When we've triggered a spawn, we did the work, then a hopper just piles in and ruins the whole clean operation hehe.
---
My point is that as a hopper, one isn't really in any position of moral superiority over a camper, and in fact, potentially has the chance to disrupt multiple servers and others who are just in those servers. I can hop away from a camp but not avoid the constant stream of Leeroys piling in for some hot sweaty melee action in the doorway while we sit there unable to get a shot in. 
---
Even those beat my usual story. "I am a dude playing a video game lol"  I just can't ever seem to get into RP
---
That may be the same general area, I'm hella close to the crashed airplane, like I can heargunshots from it when I'm in my camp, it sucks because the area is so rpetty but so dangerous, when I logged in I had a new neighbor, a Glowing Wendigo in the tree I built around, and I was attacked by two Scorch Beasts today.  By the way awesome camp!  I decided to go with a very open camp design again just because I like having more open spaces for my camps.
---
Better yet - just use basic Assassin's armor (no need to get that Sentinel its no use if you have to close the distance and melee will stagger you anyways), Blocker, Dodgy, Serendipity.
---
You'll be tanky for PvP melee - and that's just another reason I avoid PvP in this game, stack a few things and PvP gets stupid.
---

Which gives me the question "And how does that make you superior?" you could just hop and move on. 
---
Mine is arch rivals with the overseer.  Finds out overseer is hunting scorchbeasts and keeps launching nukes to try to take her out.  Then goes into the nuke zones to look for her body, but keeps being unable to find it and just picks flowers instead.
---
My combat shotgun *single no TSE* seems fine, with the correct perks and receiver it seems pretty powerful, head shotting SpamBeasts once down is a fast kill. You aren't wanting to kill other players now are you, those that may have clever armor sets under their dresses?
---
My go to TSE shotgun still runs about 250dmg with all of my perks and for most items I can still one shot them or two shot them.  The only critters I struggle with are the Gutsy but those damn things are way too overpowered to begin with.  The toughest super mutant with full armor is no match for the Gutsy.  Pound for pound the toughest out in the game. 
---
Yeppers, empty camps are really poor form. If you're camping it you should be there at least. 
---
It's the roll when it drops. Sometimes the +25 doesn't get added into the base stats of the piece. So when you get one with rad resist, check to make sure it applied in the resistance stats. Trust me, I've had some good drops ruined by rad resist being broken. Lol. 
---
Lmao nice idea
---
LOL, they need dominance at any cost.
---
It is a repeatable mission. I have done it with and without the hat (unless they've patched that) and killed different types of wendigo, all counted. First time I killed one while dressed as a clown was a glowing one. 
---
Just look for players weaseling gravity belts, they stick out like sore thumbs 
---
Server hoping is inconvenient but the camps are the worst. They both blow.
---
No. It's placed next to you.
---
I've given a power armor to a lower level player after having repaired my own at the Junk yard Workshop and having accidentally scared him. I asked for something that he gave me too, like 2 steel or something I was missing. After finishing up I walked up to him, opened my pip boy, highlighted the power armor and pressed R (on PC) and it appeared next to us. I told him he could have it as a thank you. He jumped into it and made a heart before I left.
---
No, you're just an elitist.
---
God knows I've tried to get that radium to drop. Yesterday I spent a few hours in a mega 3* server and got so many 3* in one session. Between us we got 6 radiums, all 1*. Rip
---
Best part of that server was I saw my first 3* Legendary Glowing Behemoth, what a beast! 
---
üòò
---
But people server hop to find a server that's hot with good legendary enemies then nuke that server. Club campers cause way more lag imo. Think about all the gore piles I doubt they fully pick up or their seven turrets. That's gotta cause issues. But it's more about the etiquette their turret steal xp and loot from players that even the current owner can't get unless they hit the enemy. 
---
Again I think people are complaining about melee edge cases, those with build specs to kill in PVP. I argue *most players* are PVE if melee players are right up in the faces of strong enemies and if melee was not strong they would be red paste.
---
200%? You combining Adrenal Reaction, bloodied, radicool, and Unyielding effects?
---
Isn‚Äôt it already happening with the vault tech armor paint?
---
Cant you scrap it? 
---
If it cooked food I'd probably keep it with me regardless of damage buff or not.
---
Yeah, and that's kinda my point, the self appointed community police usually seem to end up being WS server hoppers and I'm not sure they're any better. They're just sworn enemies fighting over the sane territory!
---
With my current build everything but explosives weighs virtually nothing. I pick up all the ammo I see. I really only use 12g, .50cal, and 5mm. The rest I hoard as "currency" or I gift to players in need.
---
When vending comes around you best bet there will be fusion cells, plasma carts, .45, 5.56, etc. In the Brotherhood Chapel Poor Box.
---
Thanks for the info, I thought I had a full set until I looked at them properly and realised some had the same resistance as my other trapper gear, was gutted lol
---
Thanks very much! I love the mire and no matter how annoying  it gets I‚Äôll stay haha. I have a random encounter just at the end of the train at Harpers, crab on the bridge, mega sloth in the field on the other side, and the kind ppl of Harpers ferry once in awhile haha. Thank the lord no scorchbeasts tho! Seems you are closer to the really bad stuff! 
---
Also Otaku is just the old word for weeb ;) all jokes :) haha. Enjoyed the chat friend :) feel free to add me if you‚Äôre on PS
---
Melee is fun and all, but I like using my instigating pump shotgun with +33% VATS hit chance coupled with the Concentrated Fire perk for headshots. Ghouls and Scorched take a single blast, Supermutants take 2-4. It's not very effective against large creatures, but that's why I carry multiple weapons.
---
I only would be worried if someone decided to nuke Morgantown.  Great build though!
---
Also explains why the clock never changes no matter how much time is spent doing stuff üòâ
---
I love this idea. I find the biggest disappointment in this game is the lack of interaction with other players, which was supposed to be a core part of the game. 
---
This is awesome. I've been looking for something besides the pipboy face for mine. I like it but I've had the same one for years. 
---
I'm at 500 dps on my Bowie knife lol. The 40 percent faster swing speed helps as well.
---
There's an unyielding/weapons weight combat leg on Xbox that was duped like mad with broken rad resist üòÇüòÇ. I think anyone who wears full unyielding/weapons weight on Xbox has that piece. Lmao!! 
---
It was made by BGS as has been pointed out. If I wanted to whine I would've written "this game sucks" and finished my post. I tried the game after a month away and see the same issues still just as prevalent (to me) as they were when I stopped. I know there's no new content yet but there is no way they will bring in additional content without also bringing in new issues.
---
To see that issues that have been around since launch are still present does not fill me with confidence. Does that mean I hate BGS? No. I hate how badly they've treated the players so far with 76 and anything in the future is up for debate. It isn't just one game either. This is just the latest in a long list and it's more noticeable because modders can't do what they usually do. 
---
But both cause similar issues to the "normal" player. Plus I'd wager its a very very low % who hop to find somewhere to nuke, most are piggy backing looking for already nuked servers to do a smash and grab on. 
---
was at 6/10 for ages - somehow got 3 more in last month, now endlessly stuck at 9/10....
---
Yeah. Same goes for protein he 10mm SMG. Needs sights and a silencer.
---
Yeah. I don't change servers much. Mostly to join friends or farm mutations. So I can see several different people come through whitespring. It's annoying but the camps blow the most. Usually the person isn't even near whitespring.
---
It‚Äôs just a graphical glitch. I‚Äôve seen it on friends and after a few days it was just gone. 
---
I think it's funny how I can see it from others' point of view- everybody wants to get theirs!- but a lot of people are unwilling to see it from line-up there are those of us that picked it up and want it to stay the way it is. So if that makes me "Elitist" and you continue to throw that word around like it's a bad name, to you I say:
---
Suck it, peasant. 
---
I did put it down and have been playing plenty of other things that I enjoy. However, I paid for this game and want to see it turn into something good. I came back after a month to check on it and I'm not inspired with confidence for its future.
---
Why not? 
---
It is constructive/positive criticism, even motivational words more than anything else.
---
I find a scenario of appraisal from a player, and a touching response from the creators, the most fitting place to say what I honestly believe, and what I see would be the most healing improvement for the game.
---
Saying this in a hatewagon or generic whinepost would do much less, and I only want to make sure they read what I consider the best suggestion I have seen since the game's launch
---
It is, after all, for the game's sake.
---
Not for upvotes or your approval
---
You lose caps if you are killed by a lower level player. It's kind of a reward to that lower level for kicking butt. The bigger the difference in levels, the bigger the payout.
---
You can quit the game and hop servers while engaged in combat, theres no need to be killed by the same people more than once. 
---
I had loot showing up almost instantly but could not kill any ghouls with the .50 cal due to the problem. It's possible your weapons aren't hitting the DPS levels that trigger it or you could be really lucky. Be glad you don't experience it.
---
Yes, very true. In my D&amp;D group we dont allow background stories to include being an orphan / watching parents get killed. Neither can the PC have had an unhappy childhood. It's "Hard Core Mode" for background stories!
---
That is also true I don't mind the club campers as long as they have one or two turrets. That way it's more of a alarm system. 
---
Pic or it didn't happen....
---
Probably rather the opposite. If you place more stuff the engine/server have to keep track of it needs to be further away from other built up areas and other player CAMPs.
---
If perception increased ranged damage, then perception 15 would become ubiquitous, just like strength 15 already is for melee characters. Having both stats required for damage would make mixed-modality-characters impossible to balance for. 
---
If the game wants build diversity, and/or to allow jack-of-all-trades builds to be viable then it needs to avoid overwhelmingly dominant SPECIAL choices. 
---
Same name, different look in 76.
---
Everyone is talking about whats fair for WS farming...the answer is anything goes.
---
I dont like somebody getting the spawns b4 i do, but tough shit.  this is the way the game is built.
---
get pissed at "stealers" or campers etc...then PvP 'em, or crush their camp.
---
nobody owns WS.
---
I got a guy pissed at me for using a Tesla rifle at WS...WTF...well b/c he was using instigating weapons, and i f'd that up for him.  Too bad. nobody is going to tell me how i should play or whats the correct protocol. 
---
Yup, I sit in the same server all day if I can 
---
My level points are just building up now, nothing to use them for any more, may be time for a new build.

You kill sixteen CHUDS, what do you get?

---
It's not just about those specific builds, it's that melee is miles ahead of any other weapons even before you take perks into account. All of my friends, who all have very different builds, have switched to melee because of how advantageous is it. You can kill most creatures with ease, you don't waste ammo, you don't need perks and can crit without having to use sneak or vats. To match that sort of damage with other weapons you'd need several perks and legendary stats and at that point it just shows how powerful melee is. I don't think a nerf is the right move as that will just leave all the enemies tanky without any way to kill them efficiently. Saying that, you can't argue that melee isnt over powered as fuck
---
I know 200% from just bloodied at 40% health seems a wee bit much. 
---
You can scrap items from your stored menu.  Check on the icons on the bottom for what key to press.  
---
Lore breaking stealth boys.... What ?
---
Lol, use the gamma gun, it counteracts all of this. Just use gamma guns on anyone not in PA.
---
This post really resonates with me. Thanks for sharing. I‚Äôm in a very stressful leadership position in a large Financial company, in my fifties,  and enjoy nothing more than forgetting about everything and getting totally lost in this world of no consequence. I‚Äôve never understood the anger by some towards this game. I think it‚Äôs amazingly done, looks beautiful, music is great, and I look forward to playing for a long time to come. Thanks so much Bethesda üëç well done to all of you. You keep developing. I‚Äôll keep buying.
---
There is a vendor machine coming, it's on the roadmap. 
---
Same, I would love to group up but don't have peeps to do it.
---
I love mole miner gauntlets.... With the extra blade... 
---
But I assume that only works for if you want caps (I‚Äôm speculating) so if that‚Äôs true traders still need a way to do item for item trading safely without the worry of being tricked
---
&gt; Are you also ignoring the lore where the war was actually initiated by the Zetans? 
---
completely unproven
---
Well this is it, people are inherently selfish and it is the wasteland after all!
---
It's the moralising of the hopper rather than the brazen tactics of the campers that sticks in the craw. The campers don't really care, they want their xp or whatever and will move on at some point, I fear the righteous vigilantes will find a new terror to pursue! 
---
I hate VATS it seems artificial and cheaty.
---
Did some of y‚Äôall even read the card description?   It‚Äôs for when you scrap things, not when looting bodies and containers.  Farm the area around top of the wield, equip card, scrap weapons, have hundreds of steel per run.
---
Except a Ripper and such without weapon artisan, that sucks at high level. 
---
But you are right. Melee has the best armor piercing perk in the game (75% I think) and damage reduction is huge in this game. Also the perk that reduces weapon weight also increases swing speed, therefore increasing dps. There is also power attacking, that seems to be also really effective against DR.
---
That reminds me of the line from the Praetorian in new Vegas. Your gun might jam, my fist won't, which I always found ironic since their ballistic fists shoot a shotgun round each time they punch.
---
Sorry, my bad. Turns out even dead cancer bats can fly. WHO KNEW?!!
---
Also, cancer bat is now the official name of scorchbeasts
---
Sure, if you run a VATs build. But... melee gets the same benefits, and more (15str from Unyielding is 75% more damage. 5str from Radicool is 25% more damage. Solar Powered is situational 15% more damage...)
---
No talk, only shout lol
---
The ones that piss me off aswell are stealthers.  
---
If I'm on a server, check the map. Ok no-one is at whitesprings, lets fast travel there and get some XP. I get there only to find out theres some cockroach waiting in stealth for someone like me to come along and respawn the ghouls for them. So they kill 90% of the ghouls before they even render in for me.
---
Yeah, unless it's something exotic, one run through the Lucky Hole (ok that sounds dirty) yields a TON of lead, especially if you spam use on the nodes.
---
Same. I think 2 in 5 of my chars actually need points purely because of respeccing/experimenting. Other than that you end up sitting on points.
---
We finally found the real Tip 5. lol
---
I still get wrecked on occasion by Super Mutant hordes using my 40% swing speed Sledge, it is also about game play, MireLurk King hordes are also no joke.
---
Same here. Always check the watoga blue suitcase because that's my main ammo dump.  If it's a calibur I dont use, I still collect and toss in the case for others to find.
---
The vendor machine still sounds like an items-for-caps system. Until there's a better use for caps, many trades are occurring by barter; item for item. 
---
The OP is suggesting a method to facilitate item-for-item trades, as seen in many other multiplayer games.   
---
Other posts that have already discussed the idea. 
---
That's what the Order of Mysteries did, and it would be cool to tie that in. Maybe when they open up the Danger Room. We'll get that eventually I bet
---
So that every world stays populated, even when you're not playing. It defeats the purpose if you're the only one on your server much of the time.
---
So thank you for your tips and hints :)  
---
As far as I can tell from your comments I should be able to beat the game without a problem. Even with no specific route buildwhise, which is good news for me tbh.  
---
And I'm pretty sure your tips might help me in the first place, if I decide to specifiy anyways (later), which is also great.
---
I have never bought anything from a vending machine in game and pretty much have only bought plans from vendors. 
---
I think we should all agree that PvP is fucking with balancing damage and they should scrap PvP and fix the damage of all weapons Vs the environment. Once that's done they can completely overhaul PvP and make it work in time for survival launch 
---
It's like the dupers left us all these shiny things before they disappeared! Great story!

I don't blame people farming or whatever. But I don't get the point of being afk and expecting your turrets to shot at things since you gain neither loot nor xp.
---
Can you explain?
---
Same, favorite pornhub category 
---
 Not too, I create on the tables and collect the world outside. 
---
The Elephant in the room:
---
Melee is plagued by swing lag or complete swing freeze, leaving you standing in the middle of a mob clicking away with nothing happening as they wreck your health *en masse*.
---
You don't get that with ranged weapons AFAIK. You take your life in your hands walking into high level mobs with an unreliable weapon mechanic, please leave me something to defend myself with.
---
Yeah i remember in FO4 the ripper was my absolute favourite meele weapon. When I heard that there were going to be other chainsaw weapons in FO76, i was excited to try them. What a delusion. Maybr a 50 damage, with less durability, including oil to repair them, would be a resonable change. About energy weapons, i don't want back Righteous Authority, i want them to be effective
---
Thai right here, had the same situation, started using my melee weapon to save ammo. Now I pull out my gun when I want to take cool screenshots. It's sad that my massive mini gun that shoots out lead at such an alarming rate can't compare to a wooden stick with some metal on it
---
They are stupid and impossible, they should not be in the game.
---
So, let me guess,... you‚Äôre under 30 hours in?
---
&gt;Melee is way over powered and shotguns and rifles are underpowered, especially since the TSE nerf.
---
I mean, it should be overpowered since it's a 1-in-a-million drop. The problem is that duping made it very common. Much of that outcry seems really misplaced because people were complaining about being one shot in voluntary and forced PvP encounters. The truth of the matter is most weapons do more than enough damage to kill most players, so there isn't much a way to balance the game. Players get 320 health at 15 endurance, so that's a low threshold. On the PvP end things probably would have been fine given that fireproof and the dense torso mod negated much of the explosive damage those weapons dealt. The community outrage was misplaced IMO and Bethesda over-reacted.
---
&gt;On second thoughts.... was it over powered?
---
IMO, shotguns have taken way too much of a nerf. Something needs to happen to the damage drop off over range. Further, VATS is just way too funky with shotguns. There is no middle ground with shotguns in VATS. It seems either all pellets hit or none of them hit. There are no partial hits or glancing blows like you get with hip fire. 
---
&gt;And we all know most pvp initiates at close quarters.
---
That's much different now with how workshops have been re-worked and you can contest anywhere within the buildable area. If you're trying to run melee PvP without cavalier armor and/or stealth boys you're kinda screwed in many fights. 
---
&gt;A list of things weapon classes are lacking
---
Every weapon has an essential feature missing it seems. Pistols don't have armor pen in their perks. Rifles don't have a perk that does weapon weight reduction. Melee doesn't have a perk that staggers or cripples. All of these have some minor way of getting that. Melee has a mutation (I think twisted muscles) that adds crippling. Combat shotguns have an armor pen mag. And rifles rely on legendary armor or weapon effects. 
---
I guess this is easier to see when it comes to finding your dream melee legendary for PvP or PvE. Most armor pen in ranged weapons can do a lot with 50% armor pen (the anti-armor legendary effect). With melee you're going to top out easily, so anti-armor isn't the best. Bloodied is incredibly powerful with a lot of weapon types, but those aren't viable in every situation with melee, especially for non-stealth builds. Furious only works for tanky things, so that's not super useful - especially in PvP. Assassin's for PvP is just all over underwhelming, so that's out. Anything else species specific is overly restrictive given the fact that most other effects match it's damage buff or exceed it. I think the best bet is executioner's or instigating to decrease kill time. 
---
Meanwhile, anti-armor really benefits most ranged weapons since you're no where near max armor pen cap. Furious works well with anything auto. Bloodied continues to be viable even on a dinky 10 mm pistol. Species specific and assassin's are still too restrictive. And then instigating and executioners work really well (although instigating is probably best for heavy hitters and executioners is best for shredders). 
---
I have a couple melee builds (1 PvE, 1 PvP) and a couple ranged builds (again, 1 PvE, 1 PvP). When they're built out, they're not all equally viable, but it's not quite as imbalanced as many tend to make it out to be. I really think people are just trying to compare riflemen/whatever with a sizable amount of convenience perks to melee that's completely optimized to only deal damage. 
---
Oh gosh, that's wonderful! I like the church, really cool!
---
I might build a version of the acid one. That would be pretty cool to build, but I'll have to figure out how he got the doors to shut from the tripwire.
---
More RAM means more disk cache with speed event the recent Optane can't race with.
---
It's one of many nearly useless perks. Remember, quantity over quality.
---
I am interested in representing old anchor. I am building up my stash right now. Been selling pretty well lately so I‚Äôm a bit low right now. Yesterday I moved a bunch so I‚Äôm kinda low now. 
---
How exactly, the game has super human mutants, projectile plasma hell even aliens and your issue is with being able to turn invisible. Its a game 
---
Just turn blocker off and run reactive plates or a weapon with reflect weapon damage. It's an easy counter to stalemate
---
Congratulations. I killed my first one alone (hate my friend for that one day)  Im an all around build, but I usually wear power armor since it isnt meant to take hits but more give them. I used almost all of my ammo, except for one (it did no damage but the burn did) problem was it used fusion cores. I asked my friend if he was there, he responded yes, asked him to get me ammo, never did. (i was using t-51 so i used a lot of stimpacks and was almost out)
---
This
---
I'm 182 lvl and never bought a single ammo from the vendor machine or vendor - only collected in the wild or made in workbench with Ammo perk and superduper.
---
Ha! Yeah ...mole rats....theyre the worst.
---
You can actually get a prime receiver for it. I‚Äôd be happy with just a scope 
---
I‚Äôm still annoyed the achievements were bugged when I killed the queen and I didn‚Äôt get it. 
---
Attack dog or wolf? 
---
If you mean the blueprint of your entire camp you can select the blueprint tab and delete blueprint which will then put all your items in the stored tab and you can scrap them from there

[I suggested something like this and got a reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/avqddt/player_trading_is_broken_and_needs_to_be_fixed/)
---
Exactly, I‚Äôd love a scope. I did mention the prime mod in my post but really‚Ä¶ Just one mod? I mean, this is West Virginia - It‚Äôs a Mecca for bow hunting.
---
Not sure how many hours, but level 25. 
---
I'm not sure.  You probably want to do it as soon as possible. 
---
Class freak has never effected empath, herd numbers, or grounded (?) in the user interface.  Ive heard it may actually work on those perks, but just doesnt display right.  im not totally sure.  It does seem like it at least works for herd if you check your special tab when cycling it.  
---
A bethesda person on here did say they were aware and looking into it for a future patch.  That was at least one patch ago.
---
Of course it's a game but there should be some semblance is reality, these boxes that make you disappear just seem daft. Anyway in my opinion.

---
&gt; melee is currently unbalanced with ranged. But we don't want anymore nerfing of anything
---
Well, the alternative is that everything becomes more powerful to be on par with melee, which is not ideal. That‚Äôs what you call ‚Äúpower creep‚Äù. With that design theory, the only way is up and eventually everything will be so powerful that everything one shots every enemy. Obviously that‚Äôs not how it should work.
---
Unfortunately, that means melee might have to be nerfed for the game to be balanced properly. Nerfs can suck, but it‚Äôs an absolutely necessary part of the balancing process. 
---
Really? I seem to overflow with steel without trying. I do burn through it sometimes for ammo, but I usually do a special steel/lead/plastic run right before I restock supplies.
---
The future of this game is bleak with every update they somehow break the game even more and then just make it more tedious it's honestly pathetic how they thought they were allowed to release such a fucked game
---
Never happened in all the time i was there
---
I was at whitesprings where nothing happened. probably 5 ghouls, 1 yao guai (said Grafton monster) and 1 actual Grafton monster
---
It still works, it just doesn't show the effect on your pip boy 
---
The few hours us dads can have for ourselves are few and far between, Fallout has the ability to actually let me switch off for a short time and it's bliss. I totally hear you there. 
---
And work, huh? Consider something around law in the game industry perhaps? Blend work and passion! The part about giving people a break is so true. It's easy enough to judge, as you say, but to bring compassion into being a DA and not just throw the book at every case is admirable and worthwhile. I am a big supporter of youth projects which target these people and help to stop them slipping through the net.
---
The sad part is that you're not joking. You are one of these depraved fanboys that honestly doesn't know about turret farming because you're just completely oblivious somehow. You I have never encountered more than one scorchbeast at the same time? Seriously? That's not even that far removed from reality, or a rare occurrence. That happens all the time. You're calling me out on things that literally happen all the time normally üòÇ Why would I film such normal things ??? 
---
In previous games to have OP melee you had to run high strength and sacrifice other special stats which was detrimental to other things... sacrifices had to be made and it balanced the builds so that every build was viable. The root of most of the balance problems with 76 are with the changes they made to the special and perk systems and what the game uses the special stats for.
---
I think you're just spouting words and you don't know what you're talkin about
---
Odd.  I've got a 2 shot shotty and never use it (worthless without explosive) and regularly dump shotgun shells either into stash (~5000 there) or anywhere convenient.  They seem to be everywhere when I play.
---
I guess I'll be setting up a vendor too then.
---
If you didn't get banned, why do you think blanket bans are a thing?
---
Because sometimes people need to learn that theyre being completely annoying.......if destroying theyre WS turret camp helps get that point across , then im all for it
---
Thats fine i can make that one eventually. Only serum plan i have found so far. GT: Fromager1nMN
---
It would definitely feel shitty buying the same cool thing twice. If there were no changes to the items perhaps some kind of discount if you already bought it in Fo4. The prices on CC tend to be quite a bit lower than the atomic shop also, so would they raise the prices to put them more in line? I can see that really rubbing people the wrong way, if the skin bundle is 1k points in Fo4 but now 2k in 76. 
---
I think the premise of bringing the CC program to 76 would be really cool though. Have mod authors creating cosmetics with support from Bethesda. It doesn‚Äôt seem like right now there is any shortage of upcoming items though, so I unfortunately don‚Äôt think this would be a thing just yet 
---
I‚Äôm the same and it look‚Äôs from the replies that everyone is finding ammo more than plentiful so i think il find more interesting things to vend
---
If you want to run without VATS, that's choosing to give up crits, headshots, and damage. Play style choices have consequences. If we buffed ranged weapons to bring free aim/hip fire on par with melee that would mean it'd be unbalanced for ranged weapons. It would just reverse the problem. I think if we move away from the idea that build choices have drawbacks we're losing much of what makes fallout 76 a fallout game. 
---
Melee can't get adrenaline stacks nearly as easily as ranged weapons can, and usually in situations where they are equalled melee is severely much more vulnerable. I've played both styles and they're incredibly fun, but for 90% of situations ranged is better suited. 
---
I have the Shishkebab, and I love it for its look, though it‚Äôs a shitty weapon. Would like it buffed.
---
I do something like this to grind xp for my low level and legendaries for my high EXCEPT I don‚Äôt one shot kill anything. I get it down to 10-20% and let the melee guy have it. Had some really great teamwork with rando melees that way, especially by the cabins. If people are willing to work together a bit it‚Äôs easy. If not oh well. 
---
Discussed this yesterday.  Have had at least two shut downs on xbox one s.  Not at harpers though.  Both in nuke zones.
---
It's about walking the line.  You don't want everybody one-shotting everything, sure.  But you also don't want every enemy to be a bullet sponge either.  There are plenty of weapons in the game that SHOULD be pretty powerful but end up needing to shoot even low level basic horde enemies multiple times before they die.  It's absurd.
---
Power armour, that's the trick with a low STR build 
---
I don‚Äôt see much of a comparison.  The majority of time I farm at WS and other players show up it‚Äôs typically pretty controlled and civilized.  Everyone gets a piece of the pie.  If some toolbox shows up and starts hogging the loot or starts griefing that usually doesn‚Äôt end well for that player. 
---
The turret farms are just lazy and annoying.  It‚Äôs that simple.  My feeling is if you can‚Äôt farm until normal circumstances then get the fuck out of there and let the big dogs go to work.  The way I see it you need to earn your stripes and I rarely ventured to WS until I had built up enough armor, experience, and weapons so I wouldn‚Äôt get my ass kicked.  It‚Äôs the same feeling I have about SBQ events.  Unless you can contribute to the fight then stay away and farm lower level events.  
---
Surely there has to be a better way to manage that.
---
It's finally where it belongs; a lawnmower blade set on fire is not some amazingly efficient instrument of murder.
---
Yeah.  It would be nice if Scraper functioned more like Super Duper, and gave you a chance for extra mats from whatever you are scraping.  That way you could potentially get a few more screws or other stuff when scraping for rare materials.
---
Makes me wonder what happens when you do that..
---
I don't even collect ammo I won't be using - it's a waste of stash space. In Fallout4 I got millions of useless ammo that just been in the stash, but it was limitless and ammo (except survival mode) was weightless, so it wasn't problem.
---
Play a bloodied build with AR mutation and watch those dmg numbers soar.  just got to be careful at super low HP. 
---
I can't. There isn't a option for that
---
The only time I server hop is if I‚Äôm at WS and I happen to blast some of the bots while I‚Äôm clearing out the area.  I‚Äôm not jumping in and out just to farm WS. 
---
Im on xbox and I have an instigating one id trade for the right price.
---
It's deep roleplay. As if a game is going to run smoothly in an nuclear wasteland.
---
In seriousness, I've not had this many issues in the entire life of Fallout 76 so for you to have them in one session is mental. You must not have the specs to run it correctly or are somehow causing the crash unbeknownst to you. Check you don't have a million camp items in storage or something like that.
---
My hoarding knew no bounds in Fallout 4 I‚Äôve had to be very disciplined in this game lol
---
It doesn't seem to. I'm on pc btw
---
Same on pc 
---
Nope.
---
He was 168 I was 100
---
I got an advice for low level pets like rats,dog.
---
They usually spawn and roam around the camp device. So if you place it inside your house,they will most likely spawn inside and stay inside.
---
I‚Äôm sure you are right, I‚Äôm able to stuff a ton in my camp. Crops seems to take up a lot more than they should too but I just avoid them completely, so not sure. I know one workbench will cost the same as two or three basic items and for some reason a chair takes up more budget than a wall decoration. I‚Äôve spend months cramming stuff in and have it very ‚Äúfull‚Äù inside now. I was hanging onto one rocket turret for some pet budget (don‚Äôt need budget anymore) but got impatient and took it out one day, for its cost in budget I built an entire extra building lulz

you can get 50 caps pretty easy in the time it would take to hook up with somebody for a trade...I've run into ppl waving me down and they need caps/stuff.  I  generally give whatever ppl need...new players get hyped and it helps keep the game growing.
---
Stealth Boys have been part of the Fallout lore since the very first Fallout game, they are almost as iconic to the lore as power armour or the 10mm pistol.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. The person I responded to suggested that nerfs aren‚Äôt good. I was simply explaining why they‚Äôre a necessary part of balancing, just like buffs.
---
Given the loops in the Fallout 76 world, the real question is are we as players and commentors on this Reddit sub also not real and exist in a simulation of our own? Especially given that this theory of the game world being a simulation and is not real keeps looping around.

---
Yeah I feel similarly.  Raider is treated as low level starter gear and is kinda ignored, but I honestly love the look.  
---
In general, their artists and modelers do a great job thinking of and executing scavenged weapons and gear.  Some of the weapon mods, for example:  a bottle of lighter fluid strapper to a pitchfork, a battery attached to a hatchet with alligator clips.  I love that the items are recognizable and the Raider armor is similar.  It has the protective cage of rebar, helmet made out of a welding mask.  
---
Out of everything, power armor is probably the one thing in the whole Fallout world that ISN'T going to be made of scavenged stuff, and yet I want more scavenged power armor because they just do it so well.  
---
Still trying to figure out how to tame pets. I‚Äôve got animal friend level three. I pacified a Yao gui with level 1 and it helped me fight off its brothers, but I‚Äôve never seen an option to tame. Do I also need wasteland whisperer? 
---
I think their error was literally requiring the encrypting to be done out of the game. There should have been a holotape program mini game or something. And it got easier if you knew all the letters of the codeword.
---
I've had this happen a few times and is definitely annoying. Actually just happened to my friend during a SBQ battle tonight but luckily since we were teamed up he could relog. But if you're alone, the only choice is to leave the server. 
---
what is wrong with mutations in general
---
healing factor is broken for me
---
along with the whole adrenal reaction problem
---
You can use your phone to take pictures of all items for check when offline, i think is kind hard to make a offline app with ingame items.
---
So you don‚Äôt have proof is what you‚Äôre saying. Figured as much.
---
Yip, I like to find melee bros to work with too, much like the symbiotic relationship of the clown fish and the anemone... 
---
Im not the highest, but im almost 50 and I help players usually giving them purified water, food, stimpacks, rad away/x, 1 has gotten a lvl 10 rad suit, and multiple have gotten gasmasks
---
I'm not sure that's the best way to educate people though, and again, what gives you the moral superiority? 
---
so whats the issue? is it the drops or the poor dmg?
---
if the health goes back up, its a legendary.
---
I use melee for WS...one hit usually, and they're down for the count.
---
That happened to me too, but it was like at 15%. I thought it was because someone else came in before me and couldn't finish the launch, there were 0 turrets throughout the whole silo and barely any robots spawned. 
---
I've been having issues with healing factor, as well. Even my regenerating armor doesn't always regenerate, either, for that matter.
---
I'm doing so many i forgot what i'm looking for. It's frustrating.
---
Yes!
---
I love my mansion!
---
I can't move my mansion!
---
It's perfect where it is, just a little short of stuff.
---
I agree and disagree with some your points. 
---
If it is something Bethesda did implement they most certainly would have to carefully do so. A straight copy/paste job and throw a price on it wouldn't do.
---
I completely agree though that anyone who has previously purchased such content via the creation club should receive it at a reduced rate. I wouldn't say free, after all they would have to put man hours in to altering the assets to work in the new game and a continuously updated product needs to have a revenue flow.
---
Said revenue flow however needs to be palatable to the core audience to be profitable. I think this is where Bethesda has had a more than a bit of a miss with the Atom shop.
---
But what do I know? I'm just a bear.
---
I had the same problem. My gpu powered off every time, when I fast travelled or logged there. Just cleaned my pc of dust and also checked the power cable for the gpu, which wasn't inserted properly and solved my problem.

You have to 200% repair them to make them into powerhouses.  I've seen the SBQ be soloed with a Mr Handy Buzz Blade.

Hope you got some memorable loots from the beasts. It appears that they are improving loot drops from normal SBs not just the queen. I killed about ten SBs yesterday, a third of them had schematics for prime weapons or ultracite armor. Some of them came from level 50 SBs not 65 or 80. It was a total surprise, I was expecting nothing more than rolling pins. 
---
Buff? No no no no no. But they'll Nerf everything so the shishkebab is more competitive. 
---
&gt;Now imagine catching a sledge hammer in full swing
---
Slowed because you caught it and the final hit only crushed your pinky finger.
---
I play pacifist while using my Tesla.
---
I don't always buy ammo but when I do is ultracite rounds in 100k batches.
---
Please unsuspend my account, I promise I'll be good from now on.
---
Agreed, they should make perception do the same for ranged damage, but don't nerf melee, just bring ranged up to a similar level. Then Psychotats could be the Psychobuff equivalent for ranged builds, but it should have a damage output buff rather than damage resistance (It's not "Med-X-tats", Psycho is for general damage buff, Mentats are for Int and Per) or make a new "Psychobufftats"
---
This would also add value to the power armor helmet mod Sensor Array which adds +2 Perception.
---
While we're at it, how about making Intelligence buff explosive damage? And perhaps other tech type damage like the tesla arcs to groups of enemies from tesla rifles?
---
Although it's not realistic, for game balance melee has to do a little more damage than ranged due to the requirement to close the distance like shotguns. However there is also the no ammo cost requirement which should also be taken into account for balance. Melee should be high-risk high-reward, but the snail pace of damage in this game takes away the risk of getting up close. It so easy to charge up and just stand there wacking the enemy while popping stimpacks. (I also think stimpacks work too fast, but that's another can of worms)
---
I'm on the Eastern coast of the U.S.  And my buddy who lives one town over is having the same issues
---
That's stupid. There should be no actually repercussions besides your bounty for that
---
I‚Äôm there too.  When I was around 50 I had a random player around 200 just give me about 1000 shotgun shells and about a dozen disease cures.  It made my day and taught me an important lesson that it‚Äôs always good to give back. 
---
Now I‚Äôm lvl 126 and routinely dumping weapons and other stuff to help out.  Was at train station and two guys below 20 were there freaking out and they both walked away with some decent armor and weapons I had as extras.  
---
Everything was great after the last patch this is some weird recent development as of maybe 2 weeks ago?  It started with just Watoga and the Whitesprings station and now its spreading to other areas
---
Same here, I tried Bandolier and it didn't seem to affect it, didn't wanna waste 1-3 levels for a perk if it doesn't work.
---
Or like other games and change it in the settings
---
I run on PC, and have had virtually no issues my entire time.  (decent ~2 year old PC with a 1080).  Rarely disconnect, haven't had any in a long while.  I'll get an occasional crash to desktop, maybe 1 every other week, half seem like graphic overloads.  No noticeable frame issues, no texture/glitch problem.
---
I don't think the PC version is a problem.
---
Yes, i believe so...b/c i have about 500 Fuel, and i always check my weights...it doesnt use much space with the lvl 3 BI perk.
---
however a megaton of anything will start to drag you down.
---
Yo my fault couldn‚Äôt get back on last night. But I‚Äôll be on all afternoon and night tonight. If u still have some I‚Äôll grab em. Healing factor and grounded too if u got em.

&gt; 've had a 20cap bounty on my head for two days for, I THINK, hitting a random guy who ran in front of me when fighting a legendary mob.

Rifle builds destroy melee builds in pvp it‚Äôs only over where melee shines.

Haha epic fail 
---
When I see the crossbows I think about how many times I saw it getting made in the promo. Then I think about how disappointing the crossbow is. 
---
I was getting tracked by one and eventually led it back to my camp full of turrets. The only non-broken, ammo-filled weapon I had was a black powder rifle. I proceeded to spend the next thirty minutes dying over and over again, single-shotting the diseased scorch beast. Finally, I ran up to it in low health and beat it down. The loot was not worth it.
---
Thank you for your beautiful and moving story. I struggle with mental health problems as well - bipolar disorder (most of my episodes are depressive), autism, and social anxiety being the biggest issues. This game has allowed me to escape from my messed up brain, if only for a few hours, and meet some great people who I can just chill with. I talk to my Fallout pals more than I do to my real-life friends. I'm sure that sounds wrong to some folks, but for me that's actually a good thing. It allows me to socialize on my terms, and interact with other actual humans in a way I'm comfortable with, and as a result I do so far more than I normally would. It feels great to team up with one of my buddies and roam the wasteland together. We share resources, trade weapons, fix up each other's power armor, and just have a great time. I wouldn't trade it for anything.

But I would agree - at the very least, if something is favorited, it should be blocked from selling until it is unfavorited.
---
Chapped cheeks and a rash?
---
I‚Äôm glad you managed to get it back. Must have been annoying that the vendor offered a measly 70 caps for it...
---
The health goes up once under 50% if it's legendary. I'm talking about *any* ghoul where even a sliver of health damage is instantly healed and then healed again repeatedly. Melee is fine if that's what you want but I was using my heavy gun build. It's a ludicrous thought that such a mechanism impacts normal (not hackers) players to this degree and for so long.
---
I am known as Inventorio Managemento, and my backstory is i cant ever run because Im constantly over encumbered.     I roleplay hard, so that i never actually do any missions, i just constantly try to lighten my load of my loot and junk.
---
I dunno.  Melee does more damage per swing...but the balance isn't in the damage, its in the play style.  With ranged you have sneak damage, less chance for incoming melee damage, faster rate of damage, and a distinct advantage against flying foe.  
---
Or at least, that is the way it should be.  
---
Sneak seems to be broken, as well as pretty much all heavy weapons and all energy weapons.  Hopefully this is being addressed in the next patch to a sufficient degree to make the choice lean less towards melee.
---
You basically become a member of all the good factions
---
By now you should have ‚Äújoined‚Äù the responders, fire breathers, the army, and the brotherhood. It‚Äôs possible you skipped over them but it‚Äôs all part of the story. You don‚Äôt really join them in the same way you do in other fallouts. They are mostly just questlines to gain access 
---
I do the same and if I have extra plans etc and they are there I drop stuff too.
---
Lots of players migrated from a Rifleman build to melee after the patch that Nerfed Two Shot, Explosive, &amp; AOE Damages, The nerf essentially rendered many weapons useless against high level enemies until players could adjust their Perks to compensate.
---
After a few adjustments to my stealth/Sniper Build, I was able to increase my Ranged (TSE) damage to a good level, which showed me how ridiculously High it could have been Pre-Nerf if I had been using all those perks before.
---
There are definitely some OP'd melee builds out there with all the perks available for it, but rather than Nerfing the Melee Perks, or weapons, I think a better approach would be to cap maximum damage, Period.
---
After the Nerf, I adjusted my play style &amp; build to include Unarmed weapons, that have better durability and use no ammo, quickly figuring out that they far surpassed my ranged weapons in DPS, and even though my primary weapon deals over 1200 damage which makes life in the wasteland much easier, I believe it should be slightly nerfed along with melee, Currently I can One Hit Kill a level 91 Deathclaw, and that shouldn't be possible with any weapon in the game, IMO.
---
I hear you, but don't give up! I'm keeping a spreadsheet of the date, event, location etc.,. No patterns yet but the sample size is really small compared to all events, and there likely isn't a pattern due to the really really tiny drop percentages.
---
Shouldn't have to scrounge around for bobble heads and magazines and constantly sneak and bank crits just to be some what as effective as a melee. By the time you get your criteria off the melee has already killed the rest of the mob.
---
Great idea. Also, maybe have a setting for those who don't like the idea and don't want random joining (so everyone is cool with it). 
---
The last two days there was multiple nukes launched on the same server at the same time and it was sick fun. I just tagged along with others and thankfully they let me be in the nuke zone with them and didn't kill me. It would be great to have a system to team with randoms who also want to team with randoms.
---
I think there is major problems with lack of info about items. For example let's take M79 Grenade Launcher, in recent patch it was classified as heavy gun, but what was it in pre patch state?
---
This could be easy fixed, if Beth add more info in item inspect view, like weapon class, available mods (tagged with Known or owned would be awesome).
---
There are some mods where you cannot tell for witch weapon they are.
---
Do any of those have to do with the overseers missions because mine is frozen, doesn‚Äôt allow me to play those, played the fire breathers and that‚Äôs it 
---
With what perks/legendary effects?
---
Best I've read is [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arbfab/some_thoughts_and_feedback_on_the_events_from_an/) Please note though I've not searched with any level of seriousness, there are other posts on Reddit and google may point you elsewhere.
---
You're either kidding, totally inexperienced with sledge hammers or live in lala land.
---
What perks allows 200% repair again?
---
Played entire day yesterday with my son (xbox fat and xbox S), didnt have any issue...
---
I agree.  Speaking only for myself, I don‚Äôt give a fuck how OP melee is I am not doing it.  I don‚Äôt get joy out of swinging a fucking hammer all the time.  And what‚Äôs the point of spending all your time killing high level ghouls at whitesprings to collect legendary guns if all you do is melee?  It‚Äôs boring.  It‚Äôs why I stopped playing Skyrim after level 60.  I have my TSE plasma Gatling (which is now unique!) and I get lots of satisfaction out of it.
---
I've had issues with this twice. I believe there is a car with a dead body by it with a quest item you need to pick up in addition to investigating the body by the power line base. 
---
And the Order of Mysteries
---
Allowing perception to increase ranged damage, and repairing to 200% giving increased damage on par with melee would be a nice start.
---
I always like it when a group of Vault Dweller share the wealth with the legendaries sure I could run in there and 1 hit every ghoul but that would be impolite and politeness is what separates us from the turret campers.
---
My first character was the resident plumber at Vault 76, and not a happy one.
---
Remember that "cleanest toilet" award you got while in there? You're freaking welcome!
---
Being fed up with all the "prodigies" he set out on his own, spreading the grumpiness across the wasteland.
---
Alas, the new world was even worse than the vault and even though he had a successful post-war life, over time he became depressed,  until he finally snapped and decided there was nothing left to save but himself.
---
He now roam the wastes, indifferent to other vault dwellers and with a cold hard hatred for the sick and twisted post-war denizens.
---
Yep did that one too 
---
pipboy app should have been for this game.
---
YES.
---
Yeah was a bit disappointed by that too ;) it‚Äôs only a one star instigating level 45 but it‚Äôs been my favourite weapon so far..
---
The golf club is just a crapshoot - no one has the higher moral ground here, we're all just pathetic farmers if we do the golf club.  OP, server hoppers, campers, me, anyone else.
---
Just get your kills/XP/stuff and move on.  Next.
---
Vanilla, but it was a full unyielding/nerd rage build with psychotats and whiskey.
---
Been there, done that -- sold civil unrest once by accident, like you bought it back in a hurried panic!
---
thats really odd...never experienced that.
---
I got a level 45 TSE pump action shotgun that way for only 200 caps. Only time ever. Then as I walked out of the train station a level 145 tried to wack me instantly. Maybe he did the same thing by accident. His loss, my joy I guess. 
---
Buy low, sell high -- basic venderbot programming.
---
Crouching to take a shot with a bloodied/instigating handmade is more than enough to take something out before a melee character even has a chance to get close to it, vats is literally aim bot now. Covert Ops just make sneak attacks better and adding on Mister Sandman for extra damage when it's night time, even using gun fu to increase your damage even further while auto locking to your next enemy on vats. I've seen so much potential with ranged weapons and I just feel like people are too lazy to look for them lmao.
---
What baffles me is why OP is even still playing.  These "reports" are posted on an almost daily basis.
---
I had a Two Shot Crossbow, and I used it! ‚Äì For the one challenge that asks for it, kill 76 scorched with a crossbow. Then I sold it to another player, but merely because I hoped for a better one to drop. Does anyone have a Quad Explosive Crossbow with faster reload to sell, on PS4? Please get in touch! ;-) Same if you have the prime receiver plans for sale.
---
But as yet I've never seen one drop with more than 1 star. I hope they do, though.
---
Also, I named an alt character 'Daryl' for a reason. Too bad the bow is as underwhelming as it is now. :-/ So please, bring on the mods, and I'd also love camo paint, or maybe even a high tech composite skin for it.
---
Never?? what lvl u at?
---
happens all the time.
---
It's just not Harpers Ferry either. I've had it happen several times. Complete shut off. Once while running through the nuke zone at White Springs. 
---
I'm in complete agreement here. Ranged is more or less terrible in this game. I really dislike melee, though, so I keep shooting stuff.
---
But three words: Instigating The Dragon. Almost 1000 dmg in one shot with Adrenal Reaction. BLAM. Bye bye, sentry bot.
---
getting nibbled to death by hatchlings while trying to take down a mirelurk queen is pretty frustrating as well.
---
Have you considered getting out of criminal altogether? Going for general family law? Transitioning to academia? Surely there's a nearby college you could adjunct at with your experience, then get on as full time? As much as you say 76 is helping you, it sounds like it's masking the real problem. 
---
And...I don't know how helpful it'd be, but check out your state bar's lawyers helping lawyers type resources. They're more geared to substance abuse from what I understand, but might be able to help.
---
Level 55, never seen one.
---
I've yet to hear anyone at Bethesda acknowledge this too.  I strongly believe it's some kind of issue with getting staggered by a melee enemy, because I always lose the ability to stab after I get hit in a certain way.  Have to switch to another weapon and back to fix it.  It's quite irritating.
---
That is really odd... the other day we 3, back to back at fissure prime, and then a short while later 2 more! 
---
For me it is tied to the Caution/Danger bug.  If you are in Caution you can't regenerate.
---
Does level matter for some events? Because i have been doing this since for god knows how long, i only managed to get the clean cop cap and the traveling leather's coat. I have been slowly going insane doing the same stuff over and over again
---
I'd also like to see a full short bow and long bow.  Also, give us plans for bolt mods like explosive, acid, fire, shock...
---
Ah you pray to RNGesus. That's the problem. Next time say some praise to Lootcifer.
---
Good question. I've not seen any correlation between player level, mob level, event location and drops. AFAIK its straight up RNG, but only BGS knows for sure.
---
Another point which i like to add is, that they should make other builds viable at all. I mean where is the silenced gunslinger build? Pistols are just too weak. If ranged you will take rifles.
---
Thanky ou
---
That quest is right on the edge of the map.  Look for some ladders leading up the cliffs. I think they start on one of the nearby bridges. 
---
Sorry, I can‚Äôt recall exactly what led me there, but I remember it was all part of the main quest. I had it lock up on me at one point too. Try re-listening to the holotapes that you have, and try revisiting the places that the overseer placed them. 
---
This is my first online game so I've not been through this nerf/buff merry go round before :-) If they did nerf melee a little and buff ranged how do you think they would do it?
---
The number of nukes I've seen has gone down a lot in the past 2-3 weeks.
---
Check vendors
---
I have never bought ammo but i pickup all ammo except missles and mini nukes and craft the rest. I always donate my excess to lower level players. 
---
Yeah, whitesprings is a regular and I hit up uranium fever everytime couse it's worth a ton of steel. Events are good way to get plans,xp, and mats.
---
I have tried listening to them over and over again, I will give the locations again a try 
---
This i agree with.....i kind of thought that was the point of the op....that we can work together and share. I mean really  the legendary piece of wood armor i just got shouldnt mean that much....if u luck out and get a good roll, great!
---
Reskinned Skyrim... how original. I don't think I've ever heard that one before.
---
/s
---
That's funny!  Love when random things like that happen.
---
Couple weeks ago when nuke hit and I was heading toward it I noticed something cartwheeling way way up high.  It looked like a ghoul and damn did it have some hang time.  I think it probably landed on the "expansion" map
---
Literally he was saying just to get matched with one person. It‚Äôs excruciating to server hop just to find one person to group up with . Hell we can‚Äôt even see ppls levels on the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù list so we literally have to manually hover over ppls names on the map. It sucks. It needs to be changed 
---
Its even more odd in other Fallouts, when people have just barely been surviving for 100-200 years, yet am the notes make it look like public education is the numbet one priority. Even wasted out of their mind raiders are not too cool for school.
---
I know I haven't seen too many in the past few weeks. Maybe 2 or 3, tops.
---
I think it locked up for me with the vault tech university holotape. I had to find that one again 
---
I did not know Costco was in the Waste Land.
---
Here's my rebuttal - it's physically inefficient.  And when Bethesda's nerfs have tended to revolve around making the game slower... well... maybe that's why it hasn't been an urgent problem for them.
---
Yes, you'll drop enemies pretty quickly in melee.  But you also have to run all the way over to each one.  And Scorched are particularly fond of backpedaling for miles at that *perfect* speed where you can swing and miss if you don't time it right.  Want to go after a Scorchbeast?  They kick out a *lot* of rads these days - especially the SBQ.  Enemies on different tiers are also a problem.  Do you really want to go trekking up all those stairs to reach them?
---
So yes, I'm melee.  But I also carry around a Tesla Rifle for those irritants I can't reach.  A Lever Action Rifle for the Scorchbeast that won't come down.  A Combat Shotgun for the thing that needs to be "Enforced" right away.  I couldn't ever get away from guns completely.
---
I was working on my first PA t-45 just had the left leg to put on and bam game froze lost forever it had taken me some time to get the bits together was so disappointing.
---
Strange, it happens fairly often for me (PS4).  If you need a nuke zone or event you could try server hopping until you find an active one, that has worked for me before.    
---
Winner.
---
Ive seen a lot of people say no they don‚Äôt, but my tamed Mega Sloth has died at least twice and he‚Äôs just miraculously returned the next time I logged in. So... sometimes, maybe??
---
The Enclave shall take back the wasteland. 
---
DEUS VULT. 
---
I'd say the people telling him to stop sharing his opinion since it doesn't line up with theirs. Nowhere did he tell anyone else what they are allowed to like or if they were allowed to post or not.
---
So it seems like the people respondkng to him are definitely the triggered snowflakes. Lol
---
I have my camp at the top of the cliff across the bridge from Harper's ferry and I die if I jump so I fast travel to Harper's ferry sometimes multiple times a day and not had a problem yet. Might start getting in power armor and jumping to be on the safe side though.
---
Umm it‚Äôs not? You can certainly go that direction. It‚Äôs powerful, but you need to be close... 
---
Put on power armor, go to Harper's Ferry, get killed by something, respawn, report back if it happens.
---
I'll have to test what you say and play melee for a while with all the perk cards removed, I've never actually done that, may give me a better idea whether melee base DPS is unreasonably OP.
---
Favorited shouldn't be droppable, scrappable, or sellable...
---
I think so but only because I have both and it works. Last I checked you need spare CAMP budget for the tame option to pop, but have recently seen someone posting saying it no longer counts against budget but haven‚Äôt confirmed that myself.
---
I still don't like the hunger and thirst portion. I don't feel like it adds urgency or a survival mechanic after a certain level.  I'm almost 130 and have access to almost anything I could ever want and the thirst and hunger bar is just a nuisance that pops up if I forgetabout it every 20 minute. 
---
Then again,  I love the Fallout series but never played the survival mode of any of them because i would be forced to drink water and find food. 
---
I'm not interested in that.  I just want to kill Deathclaws and Ghouls with my homies. 
---
It's like 
---
Thank you
---
The running theory is that it's a reference to Marvel Comics where the character Wendigo fights a guy whose name escapes that dresses like a clown.
---
I tried doing a quick search for this, but nothing came up even tho I've seen it described better before.
---
No idea why people are so afraid I‚Äôve so far only come across one asshole. And he was like 20 levels below me so when he tried to kill me I killed him in two shots with the worst of my guns.
---
I found a two-shot with bonus limb damage, and I am pretty sure I saw a 3* on the Marketplace.  
---
you DO get a little message clumped with your active missions, but its actually hard to see, it would be better if it made it more announced when it happens
---
Let me know if it works because I could be talking about something completely different lol. 
---
It happens. If nothing else you can drop it at the first overseer's base camp. I do that with a lot of non trade-able plans and recipes as well as excess ammo and water.
---
‚ÄúWeapon Artisan‚Äù for weapons, ‚ÄúFix It Good‚Äù for armor and Power Armor. Both are Intelligence perks that unlock around level 25-30 I think, and have three levels (130%, 160%, 200%). These only need to be equipped during the repair operation, then can be unequipped to make room for other perks.
---
Gunsmith makes weapons break up to 50% slower (5 Intelligence), White Knight makes regular armor break up to 60% slower (3 Agility), and Power Patcher increases Power Armor up to 60% as well  (3 Intelligence). These need to be equipped for the bonuses to apply.
---
If you dropped it, just make a new drop baggy. All stuff in your previous bag that is still in it transfers to the new one.
---
It's a bug that was introduced when they fixed mods being autoscrapped. Hopefully there will be a fix for it in the next patch on the 12th.
---
Amen brother. Lost my quad harpoon gun üò≠
---
Gotta say that is odd. I‚Äôve had my plans changed due to nukes quite often, usually once out of every ten log ins or so.
---
Plan to explore or junk collect then get the warning and I‚Äôm off flux hunting.
---
I haven't played in about two months now, but would consider coming back for an event like this. 
---
Wouldn't it take quite awhile though even with three teams to seal all the fissure sites? What I am gathering is you want to nuke all non-Prime sites before nuking Prime to seal them, but aren't there more than three if I recall correctly? Closer to something like nine in total? 
---
With silo cooldowns (3 hours I believe) and site cool downs (1.5ish hours) you would be looking at staying on a server for close to 9-10 hours minimum without disconnecting. With no server rejoin option and server instability, this is a huge investment to undertake not only in time but also resources.
---
garb of mysteries? I found one two days ago in a paper-bag
---
if you can tell me the level of it and the platform and try to guess what else was in the bag, I'll just assume it was yours 
---
Same thing happened to me. I fatfingered 'R' when going to perks and dropped my explosive smg. RIP 
---
On PC. I get a black screen I can move around and take damage if I die I re spawn in the same place and the same black screen. I have to crash to desktop and relaunch, and not able to join last session. Also happened someplace in cranberry bog once. Sucked because I missed the nuke event.
---
Really odd. I typically do a nuke run a day now that I have gotten to lvl 50.

[Posted a similar thread awhile back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aha3j9/what_is_your_characters_back_story/)
---
**My rogue's gallery:**
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Bear**: "Just Bear thank you." Bear is a loner. He didn't come from the vault. He was there in West Virginia when the bombs fell. Before the bombs...well...he had been around awhile. Folks around Flatwood didn't pay much mind to the hermit that lived down the road working as a gunsmith. Rumor has it he used to work for some rich Boston family, Cabot or something. Strange thing is he has been around as long as folk can remember but he doesn't look a day over forty... After the bombs he reached out to the Responders. Taught them a fair bit. Even helped keep the peace. When the scorched started showing up there was a spark of hope when the sound of his revolvers would ring through the din of a firefight. No one really knows what happened to him after the scorch beasts showed up. Some say he went back to his hermit ways when he couldn't save everyone...
---
**Alexander**: Alexander Walker "The Revenant", the culmination of the Enclave's FEV and mutation experiments and the man they could not control. Alexander Walker was a war hero, fought in the battle of anchorage, led black ops in to mainland China where he was captured and held as a POW, rescued and returned home to help police the food riots. There he died to a rioters bullet while shielding a child in the food line. The Enclave is not one to waste "talent". Many experiments on his remains with FEV and later the various flux mutations post war and the Enclave had exactly what they wanted, a super human weapon. The mind of a man coupled with the fighting ability and durability of an FEV empowered mutant, all in a relatively innocuous looking package. Pity he ran off in to the West Virginia hills on his first mission. There he became a watchful eye, a silent warden in the forest.
---
**Squire Mason**: Squire Elton Mason, Last of the West Virginia Brotherhood, remembers little of his parents. He has flashes of his father with a kind smile in a US Army chaplain's uniform and his mother with a quirky smile and grease-stained nose wearing a suit of T-51 armor. He remember flashes of bright light one night when he was perhaps six or seven and his parents fleeing into the West Virginia hills with whatever they could fit on a makeshift backpack rigged to his mother's armor. He remembers settling down in Harper's Ferry and growing up with the orphans there. He remember when the Brotherhood came and his mother and father took him and joined them. He remembers their funerals after they were killed by raiders plundering Brotherhood munitions. Then came the years of training. Elton was a squire on a long range patrol, scouting south towards Richmond when word came Defiance had fallen. With a heavy heart he abandoned his oath to the Brotherhood and returned to his home in the West Virginia hills, wandering in power armor cobbled together from the remains of his Mother's and his battle brothers, trying to be an Instrument of His Peace. To that end he has built a chapel where all peoples of all faiths are welcome, while he is content to be their chaplain as his father before him.
---
**Isobelle:** Isobelle Mariner, "Izzy" to her friends. Izzy is a true blue vault dweller. Being born in a vault without much to do other than listen to Vault-tec propaganda and and taking a G.O.A.T. that says you are destined for security can have a pretty negative effect on a rebellious teenage girl. Said effect being pumping her body full of every chem imaginable, and some she invented, while spending quality time with her guns and her girlfriends. Needless to say she was the first out the vault when it opened. Now she roams the West Virginia hills selling her skills against scorched and monsters (human and otherwise) in exchange for her next fix. Her only rules: No raiding, no kids. Everyone else if fair game for a contract.

If you could buy the perk system for FO4 I'd be game. that system was perfect but it wouldn't be an mmo if it didn't have a grind.
---
What he/she said
---
Yes please! Jack up the damage times 2 and make it so with extra jets the energy damage matches. Then it might actually be good.
---
Also while we‚Äôre talking about classic novelty weapons, please buff or at least fix the railway rifle so it benefits from perks :(
---
&gt; This would be inefficient.
---
No, it's the most efficient way, just one query vs. dozens of RNG calculations for every drop.
---
&gt;Also the data shows that the loot is not split 33-33-33 among Armor/Melee/Ranged
---
That's what I said.
---
&gt;There are 8 base armor types, 5 body parts and many armor type has sturdy and heavy, the total number is around 100. That's more than half of the loot pool.
---
Again you're just confirming what I wrote. And it would only be an even split IF it were a cascading algorithm, because then it would first be determined if it's going to be armor or weapon, and the armor variety wouldn't play the role it currently does.
---
well the server hoppers help you when they spawn in, it makes enemy mobs re-spawn
---
turret campers are horrible though
---
Also because of how armor and damage reduction works, vastly favors a small number of high damage hits
---
A message that you already have this key would be helpful. like the Plans and Recipes. 
---
Cute troll account you got there. Sorry to burst your bubble with realism.
---
It may be something we get with the other vaults. 
---
Ooh good tip
---
It was.   A robot and 2 dead women and one had a quest item to get Signal booster then summon cargo bot at Camp Venture
---
one thing that newbies and low levels in general are cautious of is power armor, if you‚Äôre wearing that just hop out and try wearing some nice clothes instead, that helps a ton already
---
It would be nice if they added the pyro perk back in too
---
Or make it so you can dual wield 2 of them.... 
---
Thank  you!
---
Cool, glad you got it sorted out. 
---
&gt;My TSE gauss just dropped from my inventory no idea if I accidentally dropped it, or your game that JUST WORKS deleted it.
---
User Error
---
Good idea.
---
I always try to reload my weapons after equipping them in my pipboy which results in me dropping them. I haven't lost anything to this day but if I ever do I will try this.
---
This doesn‚Äôt work if your too far away from the former bag. It‚Äôll create a new one. 
---
Sidebar: I can run a silo in about 12 minutes. Just get me cards and ill drop your nukes and kill your walrus with wings. : P

Don‚Äôt blame Bethesda for a self inflicted wound 
---
I am now level 64 and up untill level 45 my build was around shotguns. (combat shotgun doing about 180 damage, double barell something like 210). I have never been a fan of the melee build and hardly did any melee kills in fallout 4 but since i got a couple of grognack's axe's and all rise + I got tired of looking for plastic and lead i switched to melee.  I do agree that it's silly / annoying how much more damage you can do with your melee weapons and you are thus pushed towards melee. Getting the hang of the melee fighting but it's annoying how often i get sick / diseased from the close combat.
---
Exactly! There was this one mod my friend got that was just called "Slasher"! We still have no idea what it's for!
---
Any clue as to how far is too far. I never tried it over long distance.
---
Very true
---
how is that differnet from someone mot on your team who didnt server hop, but still ="runs in with no comprehension of how to make sure everyone gets a piece of the action."
---
I think you dont have a problem with server hoppers, you just have a problem with other players in general if they dont play the way you want and let you get a bit of each and every kill
---
I have a bloodied mm gauntlet that was doing almost 1500 a hit after adrenaline. Took out 3 scorchbeasts with it
---
I'm a heavy gun build
---
Thanks! I have some of those but I know what I'll be working on next
---
Too man folks don; trust anymore thanks to those that think theyre raiders.
---
Cool, I will keep looking then!
---
Head over to Watoga and hang in the parking lot of the school and see the distance. I can place two bag in the little islands. From curb to curb. 
---
i figured it out!!!
---
after reading all of OP's replies to the comments:
---
I think OP doesnt have a problem with server hoppers, he just has a problem with other players in general if they dont play the way he wants and lets him get a bit of each and every kill
---
At least you got it back! I accidentally dropped a nice legendary hunting rifle, and when I tried to retrieve it the paper bag was stuck with eternal loading arrows :(
---
Fav = can't sell or drop would be a good fix, I think.
---
I‚Äôd like the facility to build a second camp, just big enough for a small 2x2 shack.  Would be great to build a small hub in a pre designated by Bethesda for multiple players shops. It would put traders in one location and vastly increase players interactions with each other. 
---
At some point the player base needs to own some responsibility.  How much hand holding do you want?  I've never dropped something I didn't mean to.  It isn't terribly difficult. 
---
No, but I've noticed that the store all sweeps them into your stash box.  Check to see if they're there.
---
I will consider this definetley
---
I saw a chandelier in a ruin that I really would like in the Atom Shop.

I looted some dog armor only a few days ago! Holding on to it in hopes of a future doggo companion.
---
Nukes used to drop constantly when the game was still fresh and new. A lot of people have left, I almost never see nukes anymore personally 
---
As long as you say it like Mr. Krabs. (I don't know why.)
---
There have been less nukes since the last patch but I still see them. Try using Looking For Group if you're on Xbox
---
I love it. To each their own, but if you want ranged weapons to compete with melee, VATs is the way to go.
---
I get the point but starting it with ‚ÄúFuck you Bethesda‚Äù is a bit much for something  you did, no?
---
This happened to me (PC) as well every time I tried to travel to Harper's Ferry when a mission was taking me in that general area. Had to close out completely and restart.
---
üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥

Randomly.
---
Happens to me all the time with my sneak build.   I can shoot something and see its health drop to say 70% then immediately it recovers to 90%.    Needless to say this is irritating.    Now the strange thing is if there is another mob right next to the first one that had its health bounce back it may not demonstrate the same behavior.   Its so hit or miss whether this happens or not.   Before anyone says it, no these are not legendary mobs.    This issue has come up on this forum multiple times.
---
I can offer something that does help with this from time to time.   If you slow down the amount of fire you put into a target it will sometimes stop rebounding.   I know my first reaction is to put more fire into the target to try and beat the health regeneration but slowing down seems to help some of the time.
---
how the hell do you get that kind of power?
---
I agree. Make a master character that you play and max out and make a few for fun characters. I have few 
---
I‚Äôm getting ready for. Not every character needs to be top tier min-maxed.
---
Lara Croft/Katniss crossbow build. 
---
Revolutionary militia black powder rifle build
---
And lastly a broadsider build. 
---
Expect the grenade teleporting exploit to be patched one day.

3 went down in my server yesterday
---
There‚Äôs a field directly south of Summerville and I‚Äôve had my camp there since the beta. There‚Äôs nothing really special about it l, it‚Äôs just a nice little field next to a town full of Super Mutants 
---
This is the problem with gamers today.  Some context.  Im 37.  I started gaming when I was 6 on both the Atari and Nintendo (first nes game ever was Final Fantasy).  Ive gamed pretty steadily since.  I have never once EVER went and read a review.  The only things i've ever read were mags, from Nintendo Power to PC Gamer to Game Informer.  
---
If I see a game that looks cool, like the case with FO76, I grab it and play it.  I normally pre-order.  I don't rely on reddit or steam reviews or metacritic.  They are echo chambers for non stop bitching.  Its like people cannot make their own opinions.  Most players bitching have spent maaaaaaaaaaybe an hour or 2 in games... and thats a big maybe.f  A lot of people bitch and moan without ever stepping foot into a game (see Anthem).
---
Its also like people have checklists.  Must have A, B , C , all the way through ZZZ instead of just having A which is "can I have some fun in a video game".  Its now :
---
A) Is leveling too slow
---
B) Is the gear at end game too shallow
---
C) Is the story skippable
---
D) Did my friend like the game
---
E) Is there enough content for me to play 10 hours a day for weeks on end
---
F) Is it speed runnable
---
G) Is it streamable (this one is a valid concern with the landscape of streaming)
---
H) Does it have co-op
---
I) Are there raids
---
J) Can I play a gay minority female
---
K) Can I romance NPCs
---
I could go on and on and on.  Its quite sad what gamers have turned games into.
---
I was in Silver Shroud garb.
---
Eventually u get it set up with boosts from your armor and under armor, I got 17 strength in Power Armor but I got 24 strength outside of Power Armor, and that‚Äôs before I take and chems or food buffs, I can get it to 29 or better.
---
I suggest both. I run non Power Armor most of the time unless I hit a bunch of scorch beasts or the queen or a bunch of mr gutsy. Or a nuke zone. 
---
There‚Äôs no harm in being versatile. 
---
Those perks aren‚Äôt wasted when u wear Power Armor it just makes u adaptable.
---
And as for what kinda armor, I would suggest whatever u pick up that‚Äôs better than what u got, I got a mismatched set of random shit. Some assasins, some +1 strength, not one piece matches another. 
---
Just roll with whatever comes around.
---
I will however give u a pro tip, get full ranks of fireproof, negates like 80% of scorchbeast death rays lol
---
I‚Äôve know about the bug and still have accidentally scrapped my bulk junk probably 4 or 5 times now. 
---
Dude this is insane info. Mind blown
---
I was in Watoga most of the time too, when I noticed the problems.
---
There‚Äôs also a chance it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs alt or mule they‚Äôre using to collect certain items only. They might not have any need for them.

Well, this is it, in a team you get 4x more loot and legendary chances, add in friendly others and you can get a lot of stuff
---
Minecraft lol.
---
&gt; should of
---
There it is.  The phrase that means "I've never read an actual book."
---
Your ears are hearing people say *should've* and you've never put two and two together.  *Should've* is the contraction of *should have.*
---
It's not *should of*.  It's never *should of.*
---
Think about it.  Which of these two looks correct?
---
1. I should have gone to more dances, but I have been to a few.
---
2. I should of gone to more dances, but I of been to a few.
---
Or these two?
---
1. I haven't ever been to Jim's house, but I could've if I wanted to.
---
2. I ofn't ever been to Jim's house, but I could of if I wanted to.
---
I wish we could have a similar design in fallout so we could see how long the traveling takes. But maybe it differs based on server stability.
---
Well, that was the point of my thread, glad you got it! 
---
It's actually pretty easy to do.
---
The drop button is the same as the reload button. So if you quickly try to load a weapon after equipping it in your pipboy it's pretty easy to accidentally hit reload before you exit your pipboy.
---
I'd like a repeater crossbow like the one seen in Van Helsing.
---
I feel your pain
---
I thought it was too. Regardless, I use Radshield with a Glowing Blood Pack chaser. Which, I believe, do still stack. 
---
Yeah I found that restricting myself to a certain play style stopped me from experiencing other approaches, so my character is kind of random with different things so I can try everything. 
---
Like the idea of a Lara Croft/Katniss character though! 
---
I really wish these posts would be bannable.  No offense to you OP, but it gets old when this is all you see 24/7.  I wish they would roll it into rule #3.
---
I have chameleon, vanguard and unyielding wood sets, they're great! My vanguard's gives me 450DR at max health! 
---
Low level noob here, and i only use the fire axe to keep myself alive. Range weapons seems to get me dead most of the time.
---
It's not. 
---
Before the nerf, TSE was great.  Now it's so weak that it makes no logical sense.
---
This is awesome! Please tell me you are on PC??
---
All those things you mentioned (except online play) are in the other games. Not too mention you can use mods to add new content or fix bugs.
---
Yes, I am on PC!
---
I pretty much use it only when I need extra steel. It seems to provide a decent bonus to that particular scrap. 
---
Awesome
---
Exactly, everyone is different and most people are going to want different things, so when they don‚Äôt get it they complain and this is each individual person! 
---
I think adapting to what the game is and playing it that way is the best option, if you‚Äôre disappointed find an alternative way around it, be plenty of options. 
---
Courtesy of a poor UI design.

If I don't know what I'm talking about then why is that you didn't give your hardware spec upfront? Do I have to spell out how operating systems use the free RAM for caching data from disk, even SSDs? Fallout 76 loads a lot and today's SSDs are still 100x slower than RAM.
---
Or make it work like it has previously where you unlock the ability to recycle items and get rarer mats back.  Level one could give you back screws from armor and by level 3 you are getting back ballistic fiber. 
---
I don't know why you are getting downvoted. You are telling the truth. Oh nevermind, I know why. Because this sub is full of delusional people believing this game is the best in the world. No, it's trash. A AAA priced garbage bag, just like the canvas one they should have received. I gave up on this sub, you should too.
---
For some reason people interpret the wave to follow as an invite to PvP
---
Pretty straightforward to buff ranged damaged with higher crit chance/crit damage. Logically, it makes sense, that more perceptive shooters could more easily hit critical areas (~crit damage).
---
My Great Grandson's name will be Eulogy
---
Is that near the new gad? As in the shanty town fast travel location.
---
same UI that's always been used. Just be more careful
---
Definitely with you on this
---
As someone who has scrapped what feels like endless Chainsaws trying to get the Flamer mod plans, I wish it would boost your chance to learn rare mods when scrapping.
---
Just got one yesterday, disappointing. I'll still use it on some low level scorched
---
Oh take the stick out of your ass.
---
Except it's a multi player game now, where you can not use console command to replace lost item.
---
New game style, needs new mindsets, but being passive aggressive is cool
---
Nukes are not a laughing matter!
---
Man I got lucky and teamed up with a great dude I met on here thru trading (lvl200+) so he knew the system for sure!! I made it down in on my own before and was about 75% thru the whole ordeal and the server disconnected!!! I was pissed. But I teamed up with and he knew the process and we blew right thru it and I launched my first nuke! Not gonna lie.... it was sick!!! Thanks to the site with the deciphered codes it was amazing! I‚Äôm launching on everyday now! Specially if  I can t team up with him and his 3 thousand melee damage! Lol good fun!! Next tonight SBQ!!!
---
But... I want a mansion!
---
Lol my bad 
---
How are you getting 1200 damage on a rifle? I didn't think that was possible after the TSE nerf.
---
Two cannibals are eating a clown. One cannibal turns to the other and asks "Does this taste funny to you?"
---
Wendigos being the product of indulging in cannibalism makes sense.
---
You want to help ;)
---
Nah, I‚Äôm busy atm, but good luck!
---
Something else about selling that irks the crap out of me is when I'm selling stuff it jumps from the line I'm on to the one above what I just sold and not to the one below.  Does this happen to anyone else?  That resulted in me selling something I didn't want and then I had to buy it back.  
---
For ranged the are a few things missing that melee has, but overall cookie-cutter builds will get more then enough damage on both ranged and melee, depending on which you pick
---
Also hybrid builds can 1 shot almost everything if set up right, but with much lower damage then a specialised build
---
Since the only noticeable difference in damage between builds is seen in pvp and at sbq, its not a big issue for the casual players (vast majority of the population in game) and I don't think the devs will change things too soon to cover these differences
---
Yup - glad you started it.  No sense getting all fussed up over what others do at the WS, just go do your own thing and if it doesn't work out just go server hop or whatever else.  90% of the time I'm there now, I don't even go in the building, I just want a drink from the gazebo fountain, then poof I'm gone!
---
It's not the "first train" wreck I've hung my hat on that turned out to be well worth the money, and I doubt it will be the last.  I haven't lost faith in the game or the franchise or the developer or the studio, I've lost faith in the reviewers.
---
I end up at the same place, as you, but from a different direction.  It's the attitude that makes the difference.
---
I read all the reviews, watch some streamers play, and *evaluated* the information instead of swallowing it whole.  I didn't buy day 1 or preorder (I tend to avoid that), and once things had settled a bit, I jumped in with both feet.  It's my kind of game at it's root, flaws or no flaws.
---
I love the atmosphere, the exploration.  The game is beautiful graphically, and the mechanics are familiar (many hours in FO4), so even without a lot of other underlying perks, I knew I'd get dozens if not hundreds of hours out of it, so it wasn't a question.  And if all the perks end up showing up, even better.
---
I still read the reviews and watch the YT videos.  I have a good base to ignore them when necessary.  The $0.50/hr that it's cost me so far (and I have a LONG way to go still) is *very* worth it for me.  I don't need perfection, I need entertainment.  And I've been very entertained.
---
I love doing this.  I'm level 147 and spent most of my play time last night on PS4 sprinting around the map dropping random legendaries, junk, ammo, and marine tactical helmets to all the lower level players I came across.
---
You might already know this, but the fountain at the white springs will cure those diseases for you!
---
This.  The crossbow has so much more potential than the current state.   Being able to shoot ice, electric, or fire arrows. Or shoot stimpak arrows. Explosive arrows.  Still holding out hope for this. 
---
Just northeast of you is a monorail tower that you can build in with a junk node in front of it.  It is halfway between the monorail elevator and south mountain lookout
---
Do picture books count? Also if a book was made into a movie and their are sub titles does it count as reading a book asking for a freind. ( I left you some low hanging fruit) have fun.
---
I'll have a good chuckle for you
---
Just fyi, no.
---
TSE was the love child of duping for caps and the need for more damage. 
---
SBQ doesn‚Äôt die in 5 minutes? Better make something to do it. And why not make an insane amount of caps as well. 
---
The problem was that there weren‚Äôt enough people trying to fight her. And by the time there were TSE was a thing so less people were needed. 
---
It still has a place in general use. I mainly use mine for big game hunting. 
---
Is there any strategy to fighting difficult creatures in this game?  I am a noob so i have very little experience so far.  But it seems like there is no strategy employed that is crucial to the MMO dungeon.  
---
I usually fix a turret or two as a thank you for the purified water. I've gotten lots of ideas for my camp by wandering through others. I usually stay near the water treatment plant so often times there's one or two on the same stream as me. 
---
If you want to join my psn is Taylord1121
---
Im still trying to find out why Im so young looking after being in a vault for years and the gene pool inside the vault might be tainted.
---
I knew it.
---
there is an age restriction, a little symbol on the case of the game. it won‚Äôt stop people from playing a game they aren‚Äôt old enough to play but i don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs much of a problem if they have permission from a parent. they‚Äôre just having fun :) 
---
well people have complained you couldn't kill kids in fallout since 3 sooooo
---
but yeah this sorta game isnt for the kiddies. if only for the nightmares caused by the ghouls and cryptids. i doubt he could grabs the story behind everyones death.
---
 he might have been playing on his parents account but they sure as hell had to help him set one up if he isnt, so they would probably know if he was playing. or he was a troll player and was pretending to be a 5yo. people do that sort of thing "4 teh lawls".
---
Its always been my favorite weapon in Fallout as well. I carry one with me anyways and just use it as I am exploring and questing. Then use my real stuff when I have actual enemies. Would be great if it could be my main.
---
Do you have your own theme song ? I could see you having a show on PBS would it be animated or live-action.
---
More flame enhancing perks, or at least utility 
---
It's not over-powered melee.... it's under-powered ranged.
---
Well I plan on refining it and putting more/better detail in it, that was just a quick 20min throw together
---
Yeah you must have gotten on about two hours after I got off. I did go through and gather up some more caps and took stock of the Ballistic Fiber I have though. Should have plenty to purchase the plan and the helmet when we do get the chance to meet up. What time would be best for you? Preferably after 4PM CST.
---
My point exactly tbh. If bloodied melee builds are a problem in pvp, just spam jump with marsupial and shoot them, bloodied makes them super squishy lmao. If it's PvE people just need to learn how to aim or use vats faster. As an unarmed main i have problems keeping up with TSE weapons in nuke zones because they kill everything before I get to it. Ranged weapons are not weak, I think people's builds are the problem lol.
---
100% agree. Just this morning I was finally able to track down my unicorn weapon. I did not have the caps he was originally asking for but the seller settled for 40% of his original asking price.
---
Needless to say I finally have a *Two Shot Explosive Laser Rifle*.
---
My friend has a perfect vats roll quad crossbow. I have been trying to get it from him for that reason and that reason alone! I wanna be Van Helsing.
---
Yup, I have a problem with people being inconsiderate, i wouldn't consider that to be a strange stance to take. Good effort on the sass though matey!
---
I never took one side my friend, I think both are being greedy
---
According to the current status of the FO76 world, fucking duh doi, is what I‚Äôm saying. 
---
Also: go play FO3 Mothership Zeta after playing this: hookedonphonics.com and pay attention to the notes and terminal logs. 
---
It's called human error. You claiming to be above human error?
---
"I can't pay close enough attention to not drop an important item, fix this bethesda you lazy assholes"
---
If you read my final line I mention pot &amp; kettle...
---
They guna nerf melee instead of buffing other's... Nerfs are always fun, exactly what the community loves to see /sarcasm
---
Never said it wasn't but there are measures that can be taken to greatly reduce human error ie make favourited items unscrappable and droppable
---
Oh man, you'd probably love the shit out of it if they did that. More of that sweet, sweet click bait for you to make garbage videos about.
---
As an extension of your theory: what if one of the new updates (Wastelanders, most likely?) reveals that everything up to now has been a simulation? Specifically, a \_real-time\_ simulation. 
---
Think of all the lookout towers, weather data collection machines, robots, broadcast dishes, signal relays, etc, that are scattered across Appalachia. All collecting data. 
---
Since Vault 76 was clearly a high-profile, hyper-patriotic flagship Vault, my guess is that Vault-Tec made sure it was stocked with the best technology the company had to offer. The last thing they would want to do is to fuck up a Vault that commemorated the founding of the government that they get so many of their military contracts out of. It would be a PR nightmare and a death blow to the company. 
---
So Vault 76 would be the best of the best, the crown jewel in Vault-Tec's blue-and-yellow tiara. That's why their Dwellers got the C.A.M.P.s, a device that would change the world JUST ON ITS OWN. 
---
In the context of Fallout 76 (and the Fallout games in general), a Vault that provides its Dwellers access to a real-time simulation of the outside world to prepare them for the eventual emergence fits right in.   
---
People have been mentioning that this might explain why the Brotherhood and the Enclave are present. If that's the case, then I'm guessing that Vault 76 has been in deep freeze (and thus living in the simulation) for a lot longer than 20 years.
---
I found a head lamp mod plan for the T45 at that place today. Had to fight a legendary Ghoul up there to.
---
I think he will try a ranged stealth build with non stealth action being melee.  He already discovered a lack of ammo so he doesn‚Äôt like to shoot much.  
---
You use them? I always wondered who actually uses them.  Are they a part of ur build , or did u just collect them cause u came across some good pieces?
---
Just had a kid spam me with messages. First one said "hi, I'm 9 years old." That was followed by messages to join his team, as him as friend.... Oy vey....
---
I told him that I'm old enough to be his grandfather, and I prefer to play solo at the moment.  I am a bit hard of hearing, but I couldn't understand a single word he said, as he decided to mostly message but voice after his first message.  I offered him use of my camp, dropped some plans for him, told him to grab some water, but I wasn't adding him as a friend.
---
Bethesda isn't responsible to make it so others can't be irresponsible
---
Yeah, it sucks because the weapon damage is split between 2 types. This means it does way less damage than you'd expect because 2 different types of enemy armor reduce the damage of the weapon. I hate that such a badass weapon isn't worth using at end game.    
---
The plasma rifle suffers from the same problem. They both need a buff.
---
...but what if we play with our kids? it really boils down to involvement.
---
I firmly believe in having open communication and supervision with my kids and very few games are entirely off limits. I game with all of them (or have until the teenagers and adults got too cool for me) and really only one game has ever been a hard no for me to let them play (call of duty because you do missions that torture with no choice) but i believe in letting them play games that allow them to test things outside the confines of reality and see what consequences those choices have. and there is real world learning experiences in games too. some games are a "wait till you are older"  
---
this game is an exploration heavy open world sandbox that allows creativity to flow. my 8 year old and i play on occasion (he doesn't love it like some other game) but we talk about how the in game mechanics mimic real life stuff all the time and he was not impressed by the drinking alcohol daily challenges yesterday and abstained. its allowed us to talk about all sorts of aspects of survival, nuclear everythings and even talking about legit fallout consequences; the list goes on...  
---
that being said my kids are NOT allowed to team up with strangers or ever get on mic with strangers or use area chat. i do have other adult friends sometimes my kids will play with so they aren't entirely exposed to toxicity that some games can have. but ALL games have toxicity from the player bases depending on the game, obviously.
---
BGS isn't one entity (despite what you would think).
---
FO76 was developed by Bethesda Austin, which is what's left of Battlecry Studios, which wasn't affiliated with any other Fallout game.  Prior to this, they were a small indy developer, and FO76 got dropped in their laps (I don't know all the details, but I've read some conspiracy-minded things on the subject).
---
Like any company, BGS has wings, which don't always work together or even cooperate with one another.  If you look at the situation as if a small newer developer was trying to figure out how to make the game work, with 0 experience in the FO universe, you might have a better optic on what's going on.  (I'm not 100% sure how accurate that assessment is, but I'm sure it's at least partially true.)
---
Honestly your missing the point but your a troll
---
Everyone I've played with has lost a item this way along with many others. So statistically speaking their is a issue.
---
THE YOUR BAD BE LESS BAD mentality is juvenile and toxic and hinders making the game better
---
I have a stealth melee/shotgun enforcer build so I can reuse the same SPECIAL stats
---
Yup, it's whatever really, what I dislike is the self policing that goes on. Talk to people if their camp is annoying you but don't take and high ground when you're server hopping to rinse the golf club yourself. Hop, and move on.
---
I should have proof read my text to speech.
---
Yep, I agree it could have been a troll player but when I heard the voice it was obvious it was a kid.  
---
And I know this isn't a problem for Bethesda or xBox to fix.  To me it's a parenting problem where the parent either doesn't know, or doesn't care. Either way,m its a parent problem. 
---
 (See there I go again with my "old guy" attitude.  These kids today just don't understand! (LOL))
---
I'd also would like to know this before i get the perk.
---
Yea I think it'd be really cool if they expanded CC, but I'm sure how big of a future it has with 76. It wouldn't shock me if it ends up dying with 4 and Skyrim, but hopefully I am wrong (mostly just because it is cool to see mod authors get paid) 
---
I try to use them when I can but storage being what it is, I can't realistically use them as I have to use WWR to carry my rifles. Ugh.
---
Whatever you say champ
---
If not pressing drop on an important item is too hard of a concept, find another game.
---
This whole thing would be moot with they just move the camp placement barrier further away from the club.
---
It‚Äôs deplorable how close you can get to map markers. 
---
The power station in Watoga with the deathclaw? Saw a camp placed on the side farming the poor thing. 
---
i have not had any respawn :( 
---
something needs to be changed because it's hard enough to actually find a creature and then to have it actually show up at camp to have it just killed and no respawn ability...
---
Worked well in FO4
---
/u/Ladydevann /u/LoneVaultWanderer /u/Valseek
---
This is needed, especially since no global chat (text or otherwise) exists.
---
Said what about your parents? 
---
It‚Äôs not technically a restriction, just a guideline. And Zenimax‚Äôs terms of service don‚Äôt restrict children from playing as long as they review the TOS with their parents first (lol). So yeah, it pretty much comes down to parental discretion.
---
LOL.......
---
So past failures now justify future failures?
---
Basically your argument is that it is broken?
---
No the argument is don't be an idiot
---
My bloodied gatling gun and 50 cal shreds absolutely everything.  I can drop scorchbeast out of the sky without any problems. 
---
And do this all without having to run to the next target like a sucker.
---
Not sure I see it as too unbalanced, or at least I don't feel weak.
---
Anti armor and furious weps aren't bad either.
---
Or even just use the facilities - on very long sessions farming previously, its always good to stumble upon one of these camps, break down stuff and cook up some meat.  Sure beats walking back all the way to the main building and no one is traveling out of there quickly once you're all fat from the tons of junk and stuff dropped.  When life gives you lemons...
---
flamer fuel is classified as an energy ammo. the flamer deals energy damage and is impacted by the grounded mutation
---
Righty-O Mate if your stuck in your mindset just move on from the thread.
---
Take your own advice
---
That second sentence is there problem.  Too many parents, as I've personally seen, use games like this as a babysitter so they, as parents, don't have to be involved. 
---
I can certainly appreciate playing with your children, and think that's great when parents do.  It's the above said issue that is the problem for me. 
---
See, you're doing it right.  I wholeheartedly agree with what you're doing with your kid and your approach to the game. 
---
The game needs this so desperately to ease the burden of everyone farming the same three spots.
---
Eh
---
FO3 had this...
---
Irresponsibility implies this was conscious, its sheer bad luck based on human error. You aren't above human error just because you haven't made the same mistake and I'll be there to laugh in your face if it ever does dickhead. All its takes is to add a layer of protection to favourites items many people have done it.
---
No, but I am mindful of where there are potentials for human error.  Bethesda cannot be expected to protect players from themselves all the time.  Take an extra half second when doing something, it isn't that hard.
---
That event is weird. I‚Äôve only done it once before and I was able to get all of the waiters but after that you have to start setting the tables and it doesn‚Äôt even tell you where to go or what to grab so I never finished it. 
---
I'm the idiot?
---
You're the one who is accepting the quality of something that you agree is broken.
---
Do you carry this same attitude into all of the products that you purchase?

You think you will be on there tonight? And also, what do you think is better? Reflector plate or Tesla coils! Not sure if you can get them on t-60 or not.... sorry to blow u up! I just know your a solid business man and don‚Äôt want to give my caps to anyone else! Hopefully I‚Äôll catch you on this evening for sure
---
You don't!
---
Hatchet got mod but multi purpose axe not and It can be good for low level players (and for me while I only got legendary for multi purpose axe)
---
As another lawyer, I totally get this. I'm expected to work 10-12 hour days, 6 days a week to meet my monthly billable hours. I also have my commitments to my family. My one respite is on Fri and Sat nights when the wife and kids are asleep and I get to roam the wasteland. 
---
please show me where I said it's broken.
---
Ive been playing quite casually for a month or two and there lots of weapons where im genuinely unsure if im missing something, because it seems crazy they'd make them so useless. 
---
It does not stack. I have tried to 2 days ago and they override each other.
---
well tighten that onion on your belt and clear your throat since it is cloudy.
---
I remember my cousin wasn't allowed to play gta2 but was allow to blast aliens into green gore. my nephew was allowed to play GTAV but not kill people....parents can put weird ass rules down. maybe he wasn't allow to kill other players or go to certain areas.
---
sometimes it seems like the kids can handle more than the adults XD.
---
I agree video games are a cheaper form of babysitting. Sadly it‚Äôs a dead horse and too many people have sticks to best it with. 
---
I get warnings. Every time someone attacks it. Works fine, just need to check your alerts in the top corner.
---
I think it is just people just absolute min maxing which reduces the flexibility of builds. 
---
1500 and 800 atoms respectively.
---
I lost it months ago, it was NOT my bag.
---
Maybe let you apply syringer-style debuffs
---
They've previously said that mods may be in the (likely distant) future, I believe. Not holding my breath.
---
2. Level 80 something, and I estimate that 95% of that time is solo. I enjoy it, anyway.
---
Some are fixed, some aren't. Servers still crash, game freezes... But still playable.
---
Gonna be honest, those of you who have been playing since launch should probably ease up on the "*Oh...you'll see...*" attitude towards the newcomers.
---
It sucks that you've had to deal with a flaming trash heap for months. The game seems like it's on the upswing though.
---
 A lot of us are coming in now that there seems to be real progress being made. A lot of us are coming from games receiving *way less* support than FO76. Seriously. You think this shit has a lack of content? Try Red Dead Online right now.
---
I agree. His point is valid, but it‚Äôs not exactly informative.
---
The shiakabab is a downright badass weapon at first glance, it‚Äôs a big sword covered in fire. 
---
In FO4 I NEVER used melee because it wasn‚Äôt my style. The first time I found this weapon I was in love; I found it in a place that was filled with gas (cannot for the life of me remember the name of the place) I equiped it, loved its concept, loved its look but as soon as I swung the weapon the whole place lit on fire and I exploded into a fiery death that only left me wanting more! (The gas exploded)
---
I created a new character based around melee combat in hopes of finding this weapon to rule the wasteland as Eragon, the dragon rider! 
---
Energy damage is bad all round and needs a buff, laser weapons prove this because they just suck, energy resistance doesn‚Äôt scale the same as damage resistance and I don‚Äôt understand why. 
---
not from a jedi.
---
Do you think Bethesda intended for you to so easily be able to accidentally drop your favorite gear?
---
If not then you would agree that the favorite option is broken. Only an idiot would think that Bethesda wants you to drop your favorite gear.
---
Well I had read something about a cure somewhere at whitespring but did not know it was the fountain.  So thanks!
---
Yeah, that's pretty much the only way. You could try to put up post on the fallout 76 market as a job for someone, but even then that's kind of risky
---
Please add a prime receiver for the harpoon gun!
---
Happening to me as well as objects not spawning in like cap stashed, desks (floating computers no desk), faceless super mutants or absolutely no enemies them swarmed by 10 at once. I let the game load about 10 seconds in also. 
---
thank you! one more question about specific bugs are the damage bugs fixed? 
---
Same. Im only lvl 47 after restarting at lvl 23 (damn perks were confusing) I play solo entirely. I love it.
---
Im on xbox tho. I hear PC crashes are bad.
---
&lt;3 
---
Yeah, I feel as though a majority of the players that complain about guns just don't know how to create a viable build. There ARE ways to make guns powerful and if done right can be way better than any melee build for the simple fact they have range lool.
---
You‚Äôre crazy (but in a good way and also you‚Äôre correct).
---
personal. responsibility.
---
My fave places are the valley south of flatwoods, the mountains north of whitesprings, the same mountains but east of new gad, the mountain near the Charleston train station and the area south of the Watoga train station. 
---
yeah 5 is a bit young for graphic violence like decapitating super mutants and exploding dogs with shotguns
---
I know by age 6 though kids can be really good gamers, my friends 6 year old is a master of all things minecraft!  
---
but yeah she doesnt let him play adult games, he is freakin 6
---
I guess im old enough to realize that introducing kids to hyper violence and adult themes desensitizes them and steals a bit of their innocence...
---
...this is why I probably don't get along with most parents (or people).
---
games, TV, books... *nothing* should be a substitute for real human interaction only tools to help make our human interactions better.
---
My camp is currently outside Top of the World.  No water but close enough to the railroad station to be an easy walk even over-encumbered.  Plus I get to kill whoever's occupying the raider camp that day and pick up decent loot to sell.  
---
I am looking for locations in the Mire for my next site however.  Lots of potential but not a lot of folks building camps out there. 
---
Curious, do you have a PS4 Pro or older PS4? I use an old model and seem to have issues lately.
---
I just want to be able to track challenges from my hud.
---
This is all happening to me too, the objects not spawning until you are right on top of them like cars and chest high walls.  Its also terrifying when you get smacked by an invisible enemy and then 8-10 ghouls / super mutants just pop in all at once.  They're always so angry!
---
Nuka socker! 
---
1: The roadmap for 2019 has been released and there is no mention of private servers on it. They are being quite tight lipped about it too.
---
2: Yes and no. At the moment they have glaring version control issues. Things get patched then re-broken in the following patch. I have learned to look at patch days with a vague sense of foreboding.
---
3: Yes. All my friends quit and went back to FO4 until private servers are 'a thing' and one can play without the Zenimax Overlords breathing down your neck and telling you exactly how and when you are going to have fun and how much of it you are allowed yet myself and my alts we are still here 800 hours later.
---
If you are a person that can entertain himself, and 4k hours in FO4 tells me that you probably are, there is fun to find in FO76 as long as you can stomach the fact that (((The Man))) is going to be micro-managing how you are allowed to have fun which of course doesn't happen in FO4.
---
Is there 2 "Wind Instruments" plans?
---
THANK YOU!..  I feel this will make a great improvement to those of us who feel like victims when the Player Killers just want to kill you for fun.  I do not want any part of the PK experience. Why is it fair that they can kill us as much as they want and then follow us to our camp and destroy it too.  I will not be taking workshops anymore due to player killer A-Holes that even told me . "I like farming you" and proceeded to thank me for my junk :/    
---
Nothing I can do about it.   
---
Have any Berserker Items for sale?
---
The other weapon classes really ought to get passive scaling per their relevant special points like melee.
---
Perception should boost auto and semi auto ballistic rifles.
---
Agility should boost auto and semi auto ballistic pistols.
---
Intelligence should boost all classes of energy weapons (no overlap with P or A).
---
Strength should boost all heavy guns (including explosive ones given the nerf to demo expert)
---
Not sure if shotguns really need this but for consistency they‚Äôd be affected by Strength.
---
I‚Äôd be fine with even 2.5% scaling bonus per special point if 5% is too high for guns. 
---
I like Reactive Plates more, personally. Maybe Emergency Protocols for a Bloodied build. 
---
Today is Ash Wednesday and I have choir practice before a church service so I'll be on when I can. 
---
Yas. Upvoted
---
"Slowed because you caught it" Blocker: -45% melee damage
---
"final hit only crushed your pinky finger." Dodgy: Avoid 30% of incoming damage at the cost of 30 Action Points per hit.
---
This ain't lala land its FALLOUT 76, GG:  
---
[Hammers be damned I'm one punch man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOQ-jTfbX_0)  
---
i've known about this for a long time now, but dammit if i dont KEEP SCRAPPING THEM!
---
just last night i did it again, RIP all that plastic used to bundle....lsot forever..
---
I have a 3* crossbow I'll never use
---
Yeah, and they should move the FT/spawn in pont to stop the hoppers too
---
Yip, I always use the facilities if I can too! 
---
Been playing on PS4 since the beta.
---
Mods are available on PC via NexusMods, some question lsexist as to if some would get you banned or not. Mods not yet available through Bethesda yet.
---
Likewise, private servers aren't yet a thing, but hopefully will be one day
---
Despite what folks say about game breaking bugs, I have yet to run into anything fully game breaking that a simple closing the app and reopening hasn't been able to fix. Despite the saltiness of many with how Bethesda seems to break something when they fix other stuff via patches. They have been pretty good at hammering down many exploits and the servers are more stable than they were at launch
---
The game is enjoyable, to me, both solo and in a team.  Spent the first couple hundred hours almost exclusively solo and made some friends since and now I almost never run solo unless I'm hunting a specific item via server hopping.
---
P.s.
---
There is a story and a plot, but the lack of human npc's means you have to read notes and terminals and listen to holotapes to learn any of the story.  There's actually a good amount of lore and plot hidden away if you keep your eyes and ears open to finding it.
---
Is 76 a perfect game? No. Is it enjoyable? To me, yes.
---
There's a balanced review video out there (super long, 2.5 hour investment) that fairly talks about what's actually gone wrong with the game and speculates on how it could be fixed. Many a true nerd's Fallout 76 - What went wrong &amp; how to fix it. Admittedly, a lot of the how to fix it is the creator's fan service on what he would have liked it to be, but I would love to see his vision put into place to see how the game would work out at that point.
---
Not really. When 3 lines of code can fix the oversight that causes the user error.
---
If Apple had a similar issue that allowed iPhone users to accidentally delete their contacts it would be expected that they fix that.......not blame it on the user.
---
Probably Bloodied, Nerd Rage, and Adrenal Glands as well as 200% durability. If you're fine being at low life, you can pump out insane damage numbers right now.
---
The Man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and yeah I will probably get the game! thank you very much for the response!
---
I've only seen one? And all it gave me was a tuba!
---
All I want is a compound bow that would be sweet
---
I thought it was 5% boost per every -5% of your HP. But someone can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
---
If you accidentally press the r key you may not even realise you've dropped something this is what I am sure happened to me, as I check my bag EVERY  time I drop something intentionally. Yes bethesda should be expected to take every procaution possible to ensure people do not lose their hard earned items if you think otherwise maybe you need to lose an item first. Bethesda's job is to make a high quality fun experience and minimise things that could impact that as humanly possible and it is very POSSIBLE to protect favourited items.
---
Fo4 allowed you to lock certain items so they couldnt be sold/scrapped didnt it?
---
but most of us all came from single player FO games, where we COULD lock stuff
---
Don‚Äôt think explosive crossbows exist unfortunately 
---
You can be one punch man, hammers are one swing man. Even with your fallout 76 perks you're still getting 1 shot with any decent hammer build.
---
I can be useful sometimes :-) It can be a bit tricky to find. It's on a wall next to the gazebo near the tennis courts. It's a drinking fountain with a faucet tap.
---
I leave my Power Armor station outside next to the patio furniture so if someone needs to scrap they can. I hope that deters most from breaking and entering. 
---
Personally, if I'm to participate in this discussion, I think he's just being a little bit of a downer. If you have all perk points put into gladiator, and at least a decent roll on the weapon, you'll do an incredible amount of damage. Hell, I picked one up as a rifleman and started hitting ghouls with it at level 35. They were level 40 and above. I was dealing significant damage to them. can't imagine how ridiculous the damage would be with all points put into the cards and extremely low health, especially with nerd rage and unyielding. I really don't know what he's complaining about. He's acting like it's a butter knife which is definitely not the case if you are playing the build correctly
---
I built my camp just across Harpers ferry. It‚Äôs close to water and a sloth usually spawn near. 
---
But I do get attacked a lot from crickets.
---
But I love the place :) it‚Äôs beautiful with the forest and a mountainside 
---
if it cooked the meat every time it would be broken good, a chance around 50% would prob make more sense.
---
I don't recall them ever saying that they fixed these, although they really should.
---
There's another mouth harp in the sons of dane compound ing the stag hall where one violent night event happens. You get drunk and play it to attract the night stalker.
---
Thank you for the response! I will probably actually be reading everything I find. I guess it can have a story without human NPCs but I feel the quests won't be as rewarding as they are for me in FO4 or NV.
---
i hope they give us back the option to lock certain items/weapons/armor so they cant be dropped/scrapped/sold
---
I can confirm you do not have to keep the perk on 
---
Thanks! That actually helps me answer a lot of other questions I was eventually gonna ask about it!
---
Love it, glad you don't kill cats though.  I personally think cats shouldn't show up as enemy's anyway.  My camp is close to a site that always has a group of cats hanging around and sometimes they wander close enough to the building to set off my crouched "Danger" warning. 
---
It also has a robobrain with a paper on it's bad saying 'unplug me'.
---
Suspicious. \^.\^
---
I 100% expected to see a level 1 legendary rolling pin then. Nice find!
---
The only problem I see with gun play is sometimes finding ammo is a pain.
---
I‚Äôd love to see it get more or less the same mods/attachments as the CoD WW2 crossbow.
---
Scopes, tri-bolt, explosive tipped arrows, quick reload, heavy bolt for more range and less drop, stuff like that would be great
---
I dump all my unwanted ammo at the white springs station daily. If you need 5mm, 40mm, 38, fusion cells, plasma, etc its always in a bag on the floor. I only keep what I use. 
---
I love doing events but it's soooo frustrating when the event fails before you can even get to the objective.
---
To be honest there are draw backs.  Someone with the right gear/build can easily light me up with a gun (tank killer).  Also, shooting 500 rounds of .50 cal at a nuke card carrier drone or a SB for five minutes is no fun, but if that SB lands, it‚Äôs over in five seconds.  I wish I could crack the code but I‚Äôm unwilling to give up the full damage potential for the versatility.  However, when I hook up with a good ranged build character....we just dominate.
---
You really shouldn't take the youtube idiots' word as gospel.
---
I agree. You're right. That is just childish.
---
Lol good one!
---
That I can't argue against. It did lose a bit in the narrative when they kept human npc's out, it's actually a bit of a spoiler when you get certain quests to search for survivors (not spoiling anything by that, it pops up a bit and since there are no actual human npc's...)
---
And you have to go PvP to use them.
---
But at least there isn't another settlement in need of your help!
---
I said reviews, not just youtube.
---
Yeah and if you haven't got the travel agent card and spend big caps to get to an event and it fails....
---
Once they show up as (Known) you can drop them.  A lot of us drop things like that at locations frequented by low level players such as Flatwood or the Overseers Camp.  If they don't say (Known) then you need to click on them to learn them.
---
I hear you, just wanted to throw in though that when you fight a ton of mobs there is a certain finesse to it since the hit box is so small for two handers (compared to Skyrim for example) that makes it kind of fun.
---
I've dumped most of my ammo to save STASH space. Wish we could sell ammo to vendors...
---
Im on Ps4 and all my crashes/server isntability have DRASTICALLY dropped since the last patch that removed the duped items
---
I can play for hours and hours with no server drops
---
but, i have had a few crash to console instances though
---
so it seems servers are better,but the code of the game itself still causes CTD
---
There was a short period of time where BOS vendorbot did stop attacking the other bots but that clearly is no longer a thing
---
Only if you want to trade them
---
that's a keeper
---
Having zero expectations can, indeed, lead to not being disappointed.
---
Sadly, people generally don't buy something and then have zero expectations for that product.  
---
I have a bloodied ripper that I can get up to 206 Damage without Adrenaline, it also **does** scale with Gladiator.
---
Ok sorry you are above human error!
---
No there is a limit to the boost effect.  I actually can't seem to find any information on the limit how ever. 
---
My game froze three times last night on Xbox. Only one really ticked me off though. Someone launched a nuke in White Springs, I get all dolled up and head inside. Start picking up some good legendary loot during the first chalet. Heading to the second, the game freezes. I didn't even make it to the golf course. 
---
oh crap, i just realized Op is a constant complainer, im thinking this post is all made up for a bitchfest and karma pull
---
*username checks out!*
---
Oh I‚Äôm not familiar with emergency protocols are they better than Tesla coils? And that‚Äôs cool no worries. I‚Äôll probably ask you more questions when we link up in game! And last ? for now, which is the best PA to get the most carry weight? My excavator is pretty good without shocks I was just curious because I‚Äôm a real deal pack rat!!! Lol. Thanks for the customer service and I made a post solely looking for you the other day!! Lol
---
Yeah but i'm starting to think i should focus on trading for them.
---
I have a 1* bloodied sniper but for me its not really doing that mutch in pvp tbh. I'm I doing something wrong with my rifle build ?
---
I have a 1‚òÜ bloodied sniper but for me its not really doing that mutch in pvp. I'm I doing something wrong with my rifle build or did you get shot while he was sneaking ?
---
I've spent 50 caps to go to a high rewarding events soooo many times and it's failed upon arrival. The game really needs an indicator or something. 
---
well, in Op's defence on this one issue, I have seen 3 scorchbeasts at the same time in the same area lots of times
---
Sure. See you online around then.
---
They don't know how to buff, only nerf
---
Honestly, I would love for the Monorail time machine to work and to be able to travel back and see the bombs fall and the factions form and participate in the hopeless struggle against the Scorched.
---
Just need to figure out how to get the Choo-Choo up to 76 MPH :)
---
I built my C.A.M.P. on top of the water tower next to the railroad tracks leading to Monaghan Mine in the Savage Divide.  Running a ‚ÄúBartertown‚Äù post-apocalyptic trading post.  It‚Äôs my first camp to incorporate a pre-existing large-scale structure.
---
I previously had a covered bridge that lead to Deathclaw Island.  That one was fun.  I enjoyed watching people crossing the bridge in search of the the fabled fish man (I had that poster hanging halfway across the bridge) only to encounter the deathclaw.  But with a name like Deathclaw Island, it kinda took the mystery out of it for lower level players.
---
Don‚Äôt think so, I was being a tad facetious... ü§™
---
I've got my Fury/Explosive/10% DMG Primed Plasma Gatling (breaks after half a core) it will be great when buffed!
---
Carry weight is Excavator without a doubt... But that thing is UGLY. Any other suit with Calibrated Shocks should be enough unless you really have a problem... for instance,  40 suits of power armor. 
---
Travel Agent Perk?? Whaaaa? Haven‚Äôt seen this one yet 
---
And the microphone, I need the microphone from the airport to complete my rooftop jam!!!
---
L√§mp
---
damn man, strange flex, maybe the guy had autocorrect mess it up or is using text to speech and it misheard him?
---
If you're trying to reach the end of the main quest, you end up joining the Enclave.  There's no other way to enter the silos at the end... much to my chagrin, actually, because it seems like it would have been pretty simple to have another way to foil the handprint lock on them.  The rest is stuff anyone can acquire, like Nuclear Keycards from the Cargobots.
---
the flamer also has horrible durability. i recommend only using 1 mod on it, the Napalm canister, also the perk luck of the draw helps a lot. crafting flamer fuel currently is horrible. either farm it off of flamer traps (a good amount of them are at the Ski lodge near top of the world) or from what i have heard you get flamer fuel for crafting a new flamer
---
For sure, mod authors definitely deserve a bit of cash. Especially when you consider how much money you must've made leeching off their hard work these last few years.
---
Saves you 30% on travel costs üòÄ
---
I think people just stand still while shooting. I find myself doing that some times because you can face tank a lot of stuff. And a lot of creatures like ghouls specifically move so fast that moving is counter productive to trying to kill them. 
---
This may surprise you, but there are people who play games to enjoy them.
---
There are a few fissure sites that are unmarked locations. 
---
You are tasked with rebuilding a Flux Capacitor you require 100 Fibre Optics  10 plastic spoons and 2 Adhesive and a  Fusion Core :)
---
Do you remember what category? That an excellent savings 
---
I just assumed this is normal and how everyone plays it? So people don't actually explore the world?
---
I found one on the first day out of the vault lvl45 with some cool perks attached. I knew how great it was from FO4 but I knew it would be month before I had gained 43 levels to equip it. So I finally just gave it away. 
---
If one of the robots dies, it'll move on to the next part of the event. For the table setting you have to look at what is already on the tables and find the missing items around the gold club (plates, centerpieces, etc), very tough to do solo and keep all the robots alive
---
when you set down the door it should give you a pop up telling you the code, remember that code because if you forget you will have to place it down again. normally the door cannot be opened on the non keypad side
---
The shishkebab in FO3 &amp; NV both did really good physical damage and applied a fire damage de-buff on the target hit. It was awesome.   
---
The shishkebab in FO4 did mediocre physical damage and low energy damage with a chance to light them on fire. It sucked.   
---
Because of the way FO DMG resistance works the mediocre and low damage gets reduced to low and pathetic respectively; meanwhile the good damage only gets reduced to ok damage.
---
If you're pro with melee and use chameleon gear you kan have the sneak multipliers 2 xd.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had that, for me moving the mouse down to the bottom of the screen helps..
---
&gt; +3 stat buff food
---
This is the reason I hunt them now. Really good heath boost, stat buff. coupled with Carnivore, this is the stuff of life.
---
I use to fast travel next to a bunch of low level dudes and drop them, and I like when they start punching each other in the face for getting them
---
I'm on Xbox and I'm noticing the same thing this week. Once at a workshop and twice at vendors. The one player seemed to just be waiting to prey on someone trying to sell goods as he was hanging out at Morgantown train station. I tried to run but he slapped me to death. Didn't think to fast travel until after he looted all my junk I was going to sell. His gamertag should have been a clue. Wasn't a friendly name. The wasteland is getting much scarier and it isn't the creatures or the quests I'm worried about. Really wish Factions were a thing. Raider or Responder so I know who to trust and who to run from.
---
A lot of weapons need a second pass on mods.  I‚Äôd put crossbow up there with the LMG and SMG as needing some love.  Have picked up 2 3* ones and noted it is boosted by rifle perks which is a bummer, wish it was pistol related.
---
A child killed the charleston vendor bot right in front of me while squealing "die die die". That's the extent of my experience with kids on fallout. Lol. 
---
Yea I understand where you are coming with that. I do contribute to the mod author patreon, but hopefully monetization opportunities for mod authors only grow going forward (for those that want it). 
---
There's no way the entire studio is still working on this one game. I guarantee they're mainly on to other projects, with a smaller team left maintaining 76 and working on new content. There is probably one guy making the choices on what gets worked on next.
---
It could be like in Maze runner, where they are pit through trials to see what they could do to make a cure for the disease, but instead they are being tested in a situation where the bombs have been dropped to see how humans would react and adapt to the them. So they know what the impact would be if they were to drop the bombs.
---
Who thought the multiplayer trailer should come true
---
Please tell me your rifle secrets.
---
Why is there no saxophone.  I‚Äôve got nothing against the tuba, but with so many great sax solos on Appalachia radio, you‚Äôd think we‚Äôd get a sax!
---
hahaha I wouldn't have been surprised since there's at least one other plan like that
---
I do. I hate getting back to my camp and seeing stuff broken but not knowing why.
---
There needs to be a buy back page with your last 5 items you sold
---
yes. be smarter.
---
it Requires 7 intelligence, it has a recording hinting on how the bunker's humans died. you do not fix it. but it allows you play it
---
I still want a hotkey for weapons, rather than a toggle to go between some weapon and the-weapon-you-used-before-that-except-sometimes-it's 
---
-fists
---
Ha yh i wish u could tame them would be nice to have a few around camp.
---
Weird.
---
It‚Äôs like being rational and level headed is better than believing idiot youtube hype.
---
Just weird.
---
Also it should be noted that the brick keypad door is backwards 
---
Wish you the best with trading. I found that process equally frustrating:  Trading this rare outfit for this specific very rare outfit or godroll weapon with these exact attributes and nothing else. Can‚Äôt blame them but that‚Äôs a market I‚Äôm priced out of.
---
You know what else needs a buff?   
---
The GOD DAMN ALIEN BLASTER.
---
You're gonna make me wander the map finding keys and clues, go on a scavenger hunt, and then you get a gun that does ELEVEN DAMAGE?
---
Come the fuck on now.
---
It's in charisma along with hard bargain for better vendor prices 
---
It has a silencer.
---
And rreflex.
---
I just drop guns lmao 
---
I've played every Fallout several times ove (Except 76). I can assure you, Mothership Zeta is not cannon.
---
I dont think it started out that we are "in a simulation" but I think in a few months Bethesda will come out and announce that this is the storyline and all the bugs we experienced were actually a game feature to increase immersion and was just the simulator sustaining damage.
---
I have been keeping a legendary crossbow in storage just in case.  Zealot with the increased reload speed also.  I want to stalk scorched with it. Please add some mods.
---
*That goddam credit? Dead it. You think a buffout-head's paying you back? Shit, forget it.*
---
Totally agree, would love a way to make a set of sturdy raider armor as an example in to an outfit to wear over stuff
---
Too many horror stories here and on bgs forums. I've found people to be especially skittish when you find their camps. I like to check out people's builds and scrap /stash if I'm far from a train station, but most log out as soon as they see me approach.
---
On the plus side, someone builds at Charleston train station, just snoop around and poof, their camp disappears and you can try to spawn vendor bot 
---
Adapt or die that‚Äôs the way of the world

I use a terminal outside to open the door and the keypad inside.  I've also heard of folks using the pressure plate or switch poles to control them.  The door controls are backwards to what they should be so play around with them and see what works for you.  As far as the code, I used the small lettering to put the code above the keypad as a reminder.  
---
As a rule of thumb to wire the thing, go from the power source to the switching device, then from the switching device to the door.  Then whatever you're using as the switch will control the door. 
---
Been attacked and have my CAMP at Whitesprings far to the south near the wall.
---
You may not realize this, but a 10 lb hammer has more kinetic energy than a bullet.
---
Hol up.
---
You want people to not expect anything...
---
...and just...
---
Explore?
---
I did this and got devoured by  mutant yogi bears, and actual mutants. 
---
Was not a great experience, but you do you OP maybe they'll make you a mod of this great subreddit. MF76GA. Build the wall or nuke or whatever the fuck.
---
Nerd rage, adrenal reaction, sneaking, VATS critical; never seen it fail to one-shot with 9 rifleman and tank killer. 
---
The door has two power connection points, not one. You connect power to the power connector looking thingy on the back to power the keypad. To open it from the inside, you can connect a powered switch or pressure plate to the door itself (I target the keypad to make this connection.) It's not very obvious but that allows it to be two-way.
---
I appreciate the thought, but it is possible we have found her there are lots of vault dweller corpses out and about with no explanations as to who they are, which vault they are from etc. Now I dont think she is any of them, because she was out and about long enough, and at enough locations to have grabbed new equipment. There are a lot of corpses in the world after all including "fresher" corpses that look looted. Perhaps another vault dweller killed her and took her stuff. No more holos :(
---
With a similar build but using fury instead (and having a bloodied one) the ballistic damage can hit upwards of 1,500, electric energyy damage sits somewhere around half that.
---
I don't, however, have any sentinel gear so it doesn't take but a couple stomps or two from the queen to kill me lol
---
Workin on it 
---
Yeah, the reality is that everything in the game is unbalanced as fuck, and nerfs will only hurt, buffs are what is needed
---
And there are a couple of events that you really need extra time, especially solo.  I would love to know how much time is left on an event before spending caps to get to it.
---
Vietnam‚Äôs over, gramps. Go back to bed. 
---
*My boyfriend and I
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I will show you how it works...
---
Seriously, why no scopes or glow sights?  How about enhanced gears or string to put more lbs behind the shot?  
---
They're all backwards, its just not as apparent on the wooden version.
---
He got the shaft, balls, and most of the taint with this one. Bravo. Wish my wife was as tallented as you. Vote this man for mod.
---
Brown nosing? He went as far to get a brown ring around his neck.
---
Eh but he's a lawyer, and I'm Elon Musk.
---
Needs moar bubblegum :)
---
Yeah it‚Äôs directly easy of that 
---
So, just wanted to update this here since I seem to have found the culprit.
---
Earlier today I was experimenting with a few .ini edits of various settings trying to refine the best settings for me and also still trying to figure out what graphics setting might be responsible what I described here.  I came upon the setting for ambient occlusion, which is bSAOenable in the Fallout76prefs.ini, decided to set it down to 0, and the visual thing I had been mentioning was disabled.
---
I had originally thought it was related to TAA because it was around edges, but I had failed to realize it was always around the softer shadows at the edges of object because of ambient occlusion.  Bethesda seems to have done something with this setting from Fallout 4, because the way it looks now isn't very subtle, and I can notice it quite clearly.
---
I posted this issue in 3 different places online, and nobody seems to have shared any images of areas to compare to mine, but I did go digging anyway for screenshots and saw that it is present, even if people don't notice it, or shared it.  
---
So, if you're like me and this is bugging you, you'll have to manually disable ambient occlusion to actually remove it, unfortunately that also means disabling that whole graphic setting, which might degrade visual quality if you prefer that effect.  But for me personally, I can't stand being able to notice the grid around the shadows of objects.
---
If there's a way to lower the ambient occlusion effect so it doesn't produce the messy pixelated grid, someone else might have to figure out how to tweak it, because I wouldn't know where to start.  I would rather Bethesda tweak however they're doing AO so it's not as messy and noticeable around object edges, but I doubt that's going to happen.
---
I build mine on the water south of Fred's BBQ shack. It's close enough to Whitesprings that I'm paying less than 10 caps to pop over there and it's beautiful. 
---
I get regular attacks from mongrels and super mutants but I don't mind. I usually take the opportunity to take all of their weapons and get some more mods.
---
They really cut down on the repair cost and frequency.
---
My wife has none of the perks (her she-hulk build has no time for intelligence, lol), so she was repairing weapons and armor at least daily, more if we played longer than an hour or two. I repair my weapons every 3-4 sessions, and PA maybe once every 5-7 session due to the perks. I now repair her stuff too, and it‚Äôs definitely cut down her frequency for repairs quite a bit, even without the durability perks.
---
Monday I had shot a lvl 5 robot in flatwoods and dropped it to almost dead. It refilled to full and kicked me out of the server and PS4 party chat. had to close the game and re-open to get back in and it happened as soon as I got back.
---
Nope, its [the whole studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin). Not the entirety of Bethesda games, but the studio that made fo76 (not bethesda's main studio btw, they never touched this) is working solely on fo76. They've only ever produced 2 things and had one other cancelled project.
---
My character is semi based off the movie THX1138 but with a small twist. His body was enhanced and altered inside the vault to prepare it for the harsh world after the bombs. It was unknown if weapons and ammo would be available in the world after the bombs so he was built and designed for hand to hand combat.
---
Graps 
---
I like the bad mouth.
---
I like the others.
---
I like New Vegas because its got Blackjack and hookers. In the same fucking place.
---
This is basically my thoughts on this theory. There‚Äôs too much post apocalyptic stuff such as caps being a currency, Super Mutants, Ferals, Enclave, BoS, etc. That being said I think it is important to note Dr. Mobius ran some numbers and figured caps would become the new currency, so it wouldn‚Äôt be too far fetched that teams of scientists constructed an accurate simulation. 
---
One of my early thoughts was that we are actually in Vault 101.  We know they froze the inhabitants of 101 but perhaps they are running their minds through simulations. There was a lot of equipment in that vault.
---
I'm just north of the gad next to a temporary electric chair that has a makeshift battery to give me a supply of steel and lead.
---
I know on my CAMP site, every time i fast traval back to my base, i have weeds that have popped up or trees taht have randomly been placed in my compound
---
so, waht you can do is go into build mode, grab any item and plop the item down over the bushes/trees/rocks/truck you want to make disappear
---
you will be able to see if they disappear when you hover the item over the offending plant/tree/rock
---
once you place it, the offending plant will disappear, then sometimes you can just move the item back to where it was you grabbed it from and the plant will stay gone
---
other times, depending on how the plant is, it might pop up again instantly if you move the item you placed to make the plant disappear, so i recommend in that case using an item that is hard to see like a small welcome mat to keep the items from reappearing
---
i know that sounds weird but it works!
---
Hawaii they can make it so it‚Äôs controlled by liberators and throw in a boss liberator that‚Äôs basically Master Mold from the x-men series. Gives me a new boss and some surf and sand to take photos 
---
Ohhh, that makes more sense. I'll have to try it when I get home. I was just looking at the wire spikey thing on the back of the keypad wall.
---
Well I hope to see you from my front porch one day 
---
Lol it is ugly!!! And doesn‚Äôt have the best stats!?i think the T-60 is better for blast zone possibly...if I just get the excavator shocks this time I‚Äôll still get the bos paint for the 60. Who knows you might end up being a salesman and get the shocks for the T60. What‚Äôs the price on a pre modded t60 set? I thought I saw a price up there but wasn‚Äôt sure. IF I do grab the kitted one I‚Äôll see if you want to trade in my T60  armpit towards it if you do that type of thing
---
What do you play on
---
Have you noticed a theme in the story of this game? Not once? 
---
And the frame drum!
---
Like a good neighbour state-farm is there!
---
Just don't mention the 76 other times you were trolled by the toxic community of roodbois.
---
I think a better solution would be to tie perception to range, not to gun damage. Also buff the damage, and then have damage interact with range more dynamically.
---
This would mean that up to a certain distance, perception *does* increase gun damage, but once your target is *closer* than that distance, it's fair game. 
---
Oh, I haven‚Äôt bought it in the atom shop so I wouldn‚Äôt know what it looks like on their.
---
Also just found a few peices if x01 so maybe cal shocks might make that thing decent?
---
Back to FO4 where enemies are occasionally people because they're not all dead lol. Or DC would be cool at this point in the timeline
---
I got a quad crossbow, it was really cool but you had to tap the reload button for every bolt, got annoying after a while
---
They can barely fucking program a way for you to not be able to duplicate shit and you want them to manage a stable void-like area to make the game more enjoyable?
---
Great idea.
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
1-3 server hops could almost guarantee your instancing on a server with an active nuke not too long ago. These days I rarely encounter them which makes being high level a little more boring.
---
That's exactly what I thought of, when I saw this thread.  Radio stations for grouping.
---
Busy at work, let's get it sorted out in game. 
---
This is such a wholesome, happy post, and that band is amazing. 
---
It is just a "holotape" kinda thing. You can listen to it, but that is the extent.
---
Circle jerks like these are why I play without a microphone.
---
Also these posts really do come one after another.
---
Yet most of the time the community is toxic, glad you're have a swell time of it though. 
---
Yup, I have mine on permanent ignore.
---
OP is just trying to tell their experience within the game. Nobody hurts people by doing this. I think it‚Äôs nice to talk about the non-toxic community of fallout 76.
---
Edit: I know there‚Äôs a toxic side, it‚Äôs just I haven‚Äôt met them yet and I‚Äôve played the game for quite a while.
---
Thanks, I guess I know what my next perk card will be. 
---
Most people who chain nuke don‚Äôt launch if the server has an abundance of low lvl (50 to 80) players on it. A lot of nuke groups will server hop to find servers with people in the 100+ levels and then start the process of launching a nuke. Some groups will gather higher lvl people, join a server to population lock it, and just wait for low lvls to log out so the server goes into default and thus you can only join if you know someone in that group. Nukes still happen, just the people launching them are lower in number and very selective about the places they chain launch.
---
I've been noticing robots - turrets, bots, anything mechanical - healing themselves as I shoot them.
---
This is actually a really cool idea, if you ask me.
---
Its Fallout, why would Skyrim items be in the atom shop.
---
So you'd prefer firing the fatman to summon a Comic Book Guy to follow you around criticizing your build and pointing out flaws in the game's lore? Actually, yes, I could see that.
---
10%? What do you mean?
---
You can't see character name, just Xbox gamertag/PS4/Bethesda account name.
---
Plenty of people are buying the stuff. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it shit.
---
My cat did this last night. He sat down on my lap like normal then shifted around so that his ass was on the spacebar, while I was selling things. I happened to be researching something on my phone so I didn‚Äôt notice until he had sold all my weapons. Ugh. 
---
For the Appalachia radio too! ü§£
---
Is there a joke in here?
---
Saw this the other day, although I've only seen it once.
---
Like a compound bow?
---
No respect!, I'll have you know I was killing wasteland beast way back on my Apple ][c. Back when games came on floppy disks, not this new fangled Inter-Web thingy.
---
The reward is that in a week someone on this subreddit will post a huge 50 page conspiracy theory that if you do the quest just right that it unlocks the true lore of the game and all the actual content. (then an hour later it will be confirmed none of it is in the game)
---
What about Ultracite ammo?  Would it be worth making and selling that?
---
I love it. People complain that the store exists at all, then complain it has nothing they want to buy. Wish y‚Äôall had bigger problems in life to tackle. 
---
Where‚Äôs my daedric armor?!?  Gtfo
---
Was that supposed to be funny?
---
Lockers.. I was joking as regards BGS intentionally leaving it out so they could bring it in a future Atom Store update, but in reality it‚Äôs probably just an oversight as OP speculates...
---
Kudos for posting your opinion on a subreddit where it's forbiddoned.
---
‚ÄúSame goes for the smg‚Äù
---
As in it needs mods.
---
But it has mods. I guess is the joke.
---
If they are legendary enemies they tend to do this. It's the legendary mutation from fo4 where when you get them down to half health or lower they mutate and regenerate. At least that's how I'm perceiving it.
---
I prefer Alpaca radio myself.....
---
Or some different stations?
---
Oh shit I‚Äôm sorry bro!!! I feel bad now! Yea no worries I‚Äôm at work too so hit me back when you get off sir
---
Because that would be awesome. There are references to Skyrim in Fallout76 as it is...
---
I would like to make my own radio station and broadcast what I want.
---
What effects and what system?
---
Between Sugar Grove and the cabin north of it, right near the Breaking Bad Easter Egg. I get to farm screws at Sugar Grove, get decent adhesive from the cabin, and have a cool scene in my front yard.
---
Ft?
---
running PS4 pro here. lags hard, sometimes the ground disappears.
---
A 'bit' too young, what are you in about? Me and my brother got so scared of centaurs in fo3 I had too see a doctor. I was 14, let alone 5. The minimum age should be at least 12 to play this game 
---
That could be pretty cool .
---
Sounds like time to round up a posse and find out :). Would be a fun challenge
---
And that's where it appeases to the Skyrim fan base. You find the Easter egg go "huh, would you look at that." and then move in to your next destination.
---
Saving my known plans For my alt I‚Äôll make here sometime later. All other plans get dumped in whatever container at a train station or suitcase or trash can.
---
Can you heal with the shish kebab with the friendly fire perk? 
---
It works great with anything qualifying for Commando, including the 10mm SMG's like the Perfect Storm and the .45 Submachine gun.  Great with an auto Handmade.  With the pipe weapons it depends on whether you put on a pistol grip or a stock.
---
If you want to check a particular gun compare the damage with and without the Commando card equiped.  If dmg goes up with  Commando then Tormentor should proc, though with all the intermittent bugs you never know for sure.  Tormentor works much better with auto than semi-auto.  
---
A good test case is gulpers.  Unload an auto clip into one coming at you and see if they start flopping around for awhile.  
---
I always see people wearing the miners PA most of the time.
---
Well, how they *should* do it would be to make all weapons equally viable. They should have their strengths and weaknesses, of course, but there shouldn‚Äôt be any objectively ‚Äúbest‚Äù weapon type. Your choice of build should be determined by fun, not by which weapons do enough damage to compete with whatever the most powerful thing is.
---
Obviously, perfection is impossible. But ideally all weapons would be balanced with each other in terms of how useful they are for taking on the content of the game. And that goes for builds in general as well. Part of the reason melee is so good is that Strength is one of the best SPECIAL stats. 
---
"10mm SMG"?
---
The Tommy gun is different.
---
Melee is not more powerful than rifles.  Melee just requires far less skill so it seems like it is over powered.  There's no such thing as a bad melee player because it's so simple.  A bad shot is a bad shot, but someone who is good at playing rifles is far better off than any melee player.  
---
Once I got the Railway Rifle, the game became more fun. Now I am always short on steel though.
---
Shit.
---
I‚Äôm a dope.
---
Only for power attacks. Standard melee does not.
---
Strange. I never PVP so I don't know all the mechanics. I hit that disconnect button before I'm dead.
---
So you don‚Äôt get splinters
---
Ooo that might be worth looking into, good call, i hadn‚Äôt thought of that, I‚Äôl have to see what it sells for compared to what stable flux sells for, most sought after ultracite ammo type etc
---
I have eaten food, and felt powerful. Never have I eaten food, and my gun's bullets felt more powerful.
---
Yes! I love using one, do so even though it's basically rubbish but there is something very satisfying about the twang as you release that bolt and stealth kill an enemy, I would love to see some mods like a double or triple bolt launcher (even 5 so it's like a shotgun crossbow) and definitely some better scope options
---
Im still waiting for that first perk on a Dragon
---
Me too, or scrap it to recycle it, that would be handy
---
As many times as this has been posted you would think this would have been done by now. 
---
I personally like my cowboy duster and hat. Only took me a few hours just playing the game to get enough. I look awesome with my 44
---
No. It‚Äôs when you hit an enemy too hard and with weapons that have other sources of damage. Like with that of a TSE weapon. The game calculates the based damages of that two and weapon effects and then the explosive.  Sometimes the damage forces the game to restore the mobs health 
---
Try doing this to a real store
---
"You assholes need to fix your store, there's nothing I want to buy!"
---
"Sir, for the last time get the fuck out or we're calling the police"
---
"You can't do this to me **I'M A CONSUMER**!!!"
---
Done the same myself just farting about not a care in the world my build is all over the place but it's really fun just faffing about with not a care in the world 
---
You sir, are an idiot to assume that just because a person cares enough about something (a game) to post about it, that they might not have other real life issues to deal with. Troll on.
---
I like this idea. Only thing I would change would be to have no flux spawn in the area of the power plants nuke zone. That way there is no incentive not to fix the plant. 
---
Wooden stocks aren't easy man. It's not a simple fusion generator or resource extractor.
---
So would you rather we all bitch about the game and its shortcomings? Its better posts like this that will draw in more people to the game, that maybe have been on the fence. But coil for you if you enjiy playing alone. Ive played all the single player fallouts, and am glad we now have a game that opens up new possibilities .
---
Nice victim complex you have there...
---
Because thats how the game is programmed. 
---
I'm also on the pro
---
As more as it is posted as more popular it becomes 
---
The community is so divided any opinion at all will be met with armed resistance.
---
The way it was meant to be played. 
---
The trade-off though is we have to get up-close and open ourselves up to take way more damage.
---
Having said that it takes me over 1500 bullets with my smg to take down a SB.  They land - I can take one out with a half dozen hits of my sword.  So - a wee bit unbalanced.  
---
I'm not bitching about it I'm just saying there is a large group of people that more stations or songs whatever comes first. 
---
Play the game how you want. If you are trying to compare a "generalist" build towards one that is optimized towards a particular weapon type/playstyle , you will lose that DPS race every time.
---
You could create a build based around high AGI/Luck stacking sneak attack and crit damage. You can use pretty much any weapon you want. 
---
At level 18, everyone is a "generalist" build. You simply don't have the perks to specialize in anything. You can safely put 4 points into every special attribute and still have plenty of points to specialize in any play-style you want once you figure out how you want to play.
---
Ah I deleted the character because it wouldn't go away.  Guess I will see how long it takes if it happens again, thanks!
---
I'm playing a melee build running around the atomic wasteland with a spear and an axe in the wildman outfit. Somehow it just seems right to me.
---
did you buy the golden revolver skin?
---
We should be able to play the death tambo and the war drum when we‚Äôre not murdering people with them. 
---
I have a level 50 3* crossbow, it does 71 damage, woooh......
---
Without a glaring deus ex machina, choices are limited to nearby geography.   I‚Äôm hoping we can go to  Pennsylvania and fight the Amish menace.  We can deliver a blow that those pacifist anti-vaxxers won‚Äôt soon forget!
---
Did he make you any spaghetti? 
---
Take that shotty to a few Queen farms, and you would be surprised how quickly you blow through 5k shells. 
---
I used one to complete one of the combat challenges.  So fun.  
---
Oh I'm on Xbox
---
A big city would be sweet. Like San Francisco or NYC
---
Yep, more specifically the shot registers the hit visually with the gray health bar but then it fills back solid white.
---
Key words "Wind" but its a Tuba which is brass. Then "Instruments" implying there is more than one but nope..just a tuba.
---
Pittsburgh
---
I feel ya, I have a bloodied crossbow that I use when I'm being all sneaky like.  It would be awesome to shoot splodey bolts!
---
No, not really. 
---
I agree 5yo is too young to be playing this game. Not that I think it's going to warp them or anything. I just don't think it's something that is meant for someone that young. My 14 yo son? Sure. I let him make his own character and do whatever w/o any real worries. My 3 yo son? Nope. I have no issues with him watching me, and he loves to. But I'd never let him play it at his age. He'd just walk around in circles and be looking at the sky anyways lol. He does love to see me play the instruments and comments on all of my outfits, and also gets a kick out of my character having to "sleep" in game. When I am dressed in the clownsuit and mask, he calls me Pennywise. Crazy kids, lol.
---
Yeah.  I hear you.   And I honestly don‚Äôt care how others play.  They have every right to enjoy the game in whatever way they want.  I am only speaking about myself.  
---
Which damage bugs?
---
I heard about a lot of damage bugs where your weapons would do no damage.
---
EA might abandon it because it is doing so poorly.  
---
It wasn‚Äôt meant to sound offensive/aggressive just saying.  I mean now I made about this topic like probably many before and maybe there will be more people who post about this topic so the number of posts will rise and the topic probably catches the attention of Bethesda more and more so... maybe we will get new songs some day
---
Because the stock is core to making gun soup. A good stock is essential and creating that is often more difficult than putting the rest together when you want a good soup.  The mix and spices have to be just right and it has to dissolve quickly and in the right quantity to distribute through the rad-water easily.
---
Yes.  Server hop till you find low level ghouls.  I hopped three servers and on the fourth found them and killed my last five golfer ghouls.  I was level 97 or 98 at the time.
---
That would be amazing.
---
I think it would be cool if there were different stations, each with the sound tracks from the previous fallout games.
---
I mean I‚Äôm reaching about 500 hours into the game and honestly, aside from a million crashes when the game FIRST came out, everything‚Äôs been smooth sailing. Most all the game-breaking glitches have been fixed, and any connection drops are only ever on my end (I‚Äôve got shit internet). But to answer your question, no idea where you‚Äôve heard that one but I‚Äôve never experienced it, and the other fallout sub I participate in has never complained about anything like that!
---
Why not both üòÖ
---
There's a newer thread in which someone did this to all 10 sites but wasn't able to take down the Queen.  However another team of 6 guys did it and nothing special happened after nuking all the sites and taking out the Queen... took about 10 hours altogether.
---
What system?
---
Yeah not cool 
---
I discovered if you are spam dropping items, it may pull a piece of your equipped weapons or armor and drop it as well. Be careful.
---
May have just missed it, but what platform?
---
There's too many support beams on that!
---
To say the game can be enjoyable with no expectation is one thing. TO SAY THIS GAME IS THE BEST FALLOUT GAME IS INSANE.
---
I got it at launch had a fun time exploring, chasing around holotapes, and beating the main questline but all in all took under 150 hours with the server crashing once per hour LUL. 
---
Another "I like it so I don't get why everyone doesn't enjoy it like I do" post. Here is the thing: People expect different things for Fallout games and have different play styles. I like the game too but considering my play style, I found it very frustrating at times. I like to explore, to discover the world, to enjoy the story (however is delivered to me) and, after Fallout 4, to build. Now, in Fallout 76 I can't read a terminal or a note or listen to a holotape carefully without being attacked by a: Scorched mob, a Level 5 Supermutant when I'm level 2, a level 14 Snallygaster when I'm level 5 and so on. Weapons break like crazy and generally are shit and whenever I find a good weapon, I don't have ammo for it so I have to purchase it from a vendor. Guess what, I don't have enough caps because fast travelling cost caps and you don't get that many caps to begin with. How can I build, explore or enjoy the story with all that? The world of 76 is awesome but I can't enjoy it. I see that cool drilling thing in the Ash Heap and I want to see it more closely... mole men attacking me in droves. I barely kill them all, my HP is low, I'm out of stims and a damned ghoul sneak up on me and kills me... I play Fallout to enjoy the solitude, the isolation, the destroyed world and its post-War wonders, not to focus all my time on finding stimpacks, ammo and not getting killed. You may say "but friend, that's the point of the game". Well, not for me. I play the game but I'm not having the fun I would have in, say, FO3, NV or 4. The music is amazing, the world is amazing but the gameplay sucks and that's it. This is why, OP, I can't explore, can't play the game with a clear head and the only expectation I have is "I have to get a stimpack or that level 1 Ghoul will kill me in two swings when I'm level 10."
---
My CAMP is like that.
---
Xbox so sorry. 
---
This sounds really interesting - though you're right in that it would take some balancing to make it worth not just blowing it up. 
---
Xbox sorry bout that!
---
Once you‚Äôve read them, you know them for ever.  Click on them in pipboy and they vanish.
---
I kinda do the same thing. Just waiting for this roadmap stuff to start up. Also gathering plans and outfits to sell at my player vending when it comes April 9th! 
---
i‚Äôve fought the queen so many times and i‚Äôve never gotten any from them üò≠üò≠
---
Oh ok. I'm on ps4. Was going to give it a try lol
---
Wood stocks can contain clean kits, ammo, tools, and most contain a rod that acts a stabilizing piece for the gun. 
---
Not only that it‚Äôs actually difficult to shape that kind of of wood work without proper tools. 
---
You could also just make the drops in the surrounding area more worthwhile and remove them when the reactor goes critical. That way, preventing a non-instigated nuke protects an area from losing resources (make it resource-void when it's a disaster) as opposed to making it resource rich when its player-nuked.
---
I really would have spent a lot more money if items were in the $5 range but the current pricing     makes it seem too high for whim buys. That said, they haven't dropped prices so I guess others are buying...
---
Good point. I played 90% sandbox until about level 35, just exploring and doing dailies. It was lots of fun, but wholly crap it was a slow leveling process.
---
On the plus side, when I finally focused on questing I got some pretty sweet weapons at highish level. 
---
Water breathing perk? Do you mean Aquaboy?  I grabbed it because i kept spawning in water locations back when my CAMP was on a riverbed.  It‚Äôs useful for that and for crossing water but it does not protect you from disease so it‚Äôs utility is limited.  
---
I‚Äôve lost items. I‚Äôve accidentally scrapped items at the bench in both this game and 76. Ive dome stuff like this in a lot of games accidentally get rid of the wrong item. My response has always been the same. ‚ÄúMy bad‚Äù I‚Äôve never once blamed the devs for my own stupid mistake
---
I need to make this!!! It‚Äôs actually really cool to see functional camp designs and not the common house made of a single foundation and floating. 
---
This is something in the middle and would work well
---
Hey, no spoilers, please! ;-)
---
No. I‚Äôm still kinda new. Is it limited time or always,  cause I‚Äôll save up
---
Currently wearing a hodgepodge of leather, combat and metal parts over army fatigues... 
---
Weapon balance in this game is so bad...
---
Personally, I do enjoy the game very much. I'm still figuring it out, but what I really love about it are the stories. I like listening to the holotapes and reading the notes left around. It really makes makes the game interesting for me.
---
I've played solo and had fun...but, I recently started playing with teams, and it's even more fun for me. I think it's definitely worth playing alone, and with groups! There are a lot of higher level players who help out lower levels as well. 
---
I like taking workshops, and being in a team definitely makes that more possible.
---
I too have silt bean frustrations, I‚Äôd love to see them as a plantable crop üëç
---
In fact... forget the blackjack
---
reminds me of Fo 3 enclave officer Armor but with a back pack 
---
Should probably benefit from perks too, like rifleman.
---
Fast travel 
---
I feel ya. However Iguana bits and whatnot. Are a play on fallout lore. As you never really see a living iguana so the joke is it‚Äôs human meat and or mystery meat. 
---
Go for a bloodied build for max damage
---
Ah. I always see Tp and not ft. 
---
100% agree with you, it‚Äôs a weapon in a video game. There are millions more like it, and you‚Äôll find another just like you found the one you lost/sold/dropped/etc. 
---
heh, I did. glad to see they listened with 76 ;)
---
Challenge accepted!
---
At first I thought, wow what a cool camp but then I realized it wasn't a screen shot and told myself, I gotta make this
---
If it's a mutant version it gives 10% more damage if you're mutated
---
Or one day they'll get fed up with us and make it only play "Ants in My Pants" 24/7.
---
If your entire camp is stored in a blueprint in Store (this happens automatically when you move camp), then you should be able to select that blueprint in Store (usually the first or second icon in the list), then chose store, and it should break down all of the components of your camp.
---
I know, right. Any other food that gives those sort of buffs require numerous ingredients. Bats and squirrels, best diet ingame.
---
# Suggestions:
---
Small timer under Events: So when checking for events i often hesitate purely cause i have no idea how long before it ends, a small timer while hovering over the event on the map would be a awesome new addition.
---
VSYNC: So a friend of mine who has a 60hz monitor was noticing his GPU was getting quite hot and loud. the FPS is unlocked while it¬¥s better than being forced lock at 60hz a option in the display tab would be nice. (PC)
---
Frame Rate Cap: a small but nice addition, usually selecting between 30, 60, 90, Unlimited.
---
Renaming Weapons/Armor: it would really come in handy especially with Power Armor, make it happen.
---
# FOV Slider on Console
---
Bunch of my friends play on console both PS4 and Xbox One, so i tend to play with them from time to time and the lack of FOV Slider in the console version is baffling.
---
That make sense. They get kinda nasty lol
---
Well, yeah, that‚Äôs the problem with both. They shouldn‚Äôt be necessitated by the shitty loot mechanics, but they are. And even then, if it wasn‚Äôt absolutely necessary to have legendaries to even play the game at a higher level, it wouldn‚Äôt be necessary to cheese. I run all normal weapons most of the time, because I can‚Äôt find legendaries of the weapons that fit my play style, and if I‚Äôm not doing stealth crits, taking out enemies is a chore and in no way rewarding. 
---
Well that means it can't be furious as well
---
# PC,PS4,Xbox One X
---
I'm not even sure if it is still in the shop. I might have been limited time like a month ago. Check skins
---
one day older and deeper in debt...
---
I nuked fissure site by golf course ws when I get on I‚Äôll tell y‚Äôall what find it‚Äôs been like 2 months though 
---
Preface: YMMV, I'm on PC, all three of my characters have experienced it, I've heard it mentioned on team comms as well, and even when server lag is minimal.
---
Since B.E.T.A., ranged attacks (esp. stealth-sniper builds) have suffered that issue with varying periodicity -- and up to 99% damage 'instaheal' for enemies (literally, a one-pixel net health reduction) ...
---
... yet other times, normal damage. It's baffling, and a bug they say they've worked on/fixed, but I can't remember it NOT happening in at least one longer engagement per play session.
---
Fallout 4 did it
---
This is why you have "channels" for those things.  And the ability to 'mute' channels if you aren't interested in their content.  And rules that can get you temp-banned for violations (like spamming the same message repeatedly in a channel, etc.)
---
Yeah, it means more work for Bethesda to simply support it.  The code side isn't really that hard.  It's getting it to where it doesn't become a toxic, bot-infested, spamfest (and keeping it that way) that's the effort.
---
I hope they just start focusing on FO5 or a different game and learn from there mistakes with FO76 
---
I knew that, but it should still require "Iguana Bits", which are in the game, even if it isn't technically "iguana". And does that mean "Iguana on a Stick" is rabbit, and the mystery is finally solved? But that would go against the established lore of it being human or mystery meat, so just make the damn soup need the Bits and continuity, lore, and my sanity will all be well...
---
This.  
---
Went thru a huge slump with this game after about a month of struggling to enjoy it.  took about a month off and reset my play style.  Now I'm loving it.
---
I dont mind the other players (I used to hate not playing alone) but I do miss the save whenever you want aspect.  FO4 was tops but this world is so deep and interesting.
---
Iv'e come to love it.  
---
Hazmat suit and a lot of defence perks 
---
I‚Äôm sorry perhaps I‚Äôm misunderstanding...are you saying that you went to therapy specifically because of something you saw in Fallout 3 at age 14?
---
one time I got a legendary quad crossbow. it took me about a minute to load it.
---
Then I'm getting something else cuz I use a death Tambo and when I knock a legendary enemy down to have health, they regenerate back to full health
---
Pretty much
---
I think it varies heavily on the individual. I was playing Fallout 3 when I was 10
---
My character‚Äôs name is Bethaniel. More specifically, Bethaniel, man eater. She was a cannibal that managed to sneak into 76 before it closed and hid for 20 years in that vault. Pre-war, she was insane. After seeing the world go to shit and how ape-shit the world became though, she had a sort of ‚Äúawakening‚Äù. She‚Äôs given up her cannibalistic ways and has sought out a new way of living. She helps those in need whenever she cans, but also kills anyone who stands in her way of achieving that goal. Oh! And she loves to design buildings!
---
Although I may have been a bit younger, although around that age
---
hazmat suit
---
Think of it this way, the longer it takes for Bethesda to add items you really want, the more time you have to accumulate points. So, at least by the time something you want is added, you'll have enough.
---
VERY well decorated!
---
Worst. Build. Ever.
---
Veil of secrts
---
Did you write this post a month ago and just post it now? Everyone has had explosive weapons for quite some time. I have actually seen less people using explosives since the nerf.
---
ok but what perks give high enough damage/energy resistance?
---
Try googling ‚ÄúNukes And Dragons explosives builds‚Äù. If you can‚Äôt find any like you could always use it to make changes or make your own. 
---
Heavy Trapper has great resist against rads. Plus perk cards, and team sharing perks. You'll still take rads but a lot less. Its doable
---
Honestly don‚Äôt worry about it so much. I tell people all the time it‚Äôs a game stop putting your everything into something doesn‚Äôt need it. 
---
I‚Äôve seen discord‚Äôs shutdown because people couldn‚Äôt handle the whole jet pre-war/post-war thing.  
---
Hazmat not being overarmor is a joke
---
Try perching on the wall in between the pool and the clubhouse and shoot the can alarms to get the ghouls to come out.  They can‚Äôt get you up in the wall. 
---
One of the Savage Divide treasure maps gave me mine. Found another one on a ghoul in WS.
---
Then that‚Äôs the legendary mutated effect. All legendary mobs can regen health when brought to low health. 
---
Does that still help if I'm full Hp?
---
mindless kill and wait for hours in the same spot, have fun. Who needs to explore or rebuild Appalachia lets just grind for TSE weapons
---
It depends on your build/weapons. If you're stealth you should just be able to sneak around killing them.. If you're heavy weapons/PA it's just easier to run through the golf club and aggro them all and run back out side the door and mow them down as they funnel out the choke point. If you get overwhelmed go to the tennis court and use the net to screw with their pathing.
---
You ar not alone on this wish. Please hear us Bethesda, there are gamers that want a purely crossbow build and need more mods to make it happen.
---
Rad sponge + goulish and a team. 
---
if we get those... ima need an outfit to make me look like an elf, or Link.....maybe hawkeye?
---
I am familiar w/ the ‚ÄúVATS ... pause ... shoot‚Äù ... quite familiar. 
---
He's probably making a white Russian, he'll be back soon.
---
Oh nice I will try this for sure. This is the thing I wanted to learn thank you really. 
---
I try to drop some plans if it would be helpful for the player.  I prefer to leave plans for people under level 65 because a lot of the plans I've found are most useful for them.
---
Holy god
---
The only (known) I've been holding on to is the Marine wetsuit, everything else I toss at the overseer's camp.
---
But, there are living iguana's in 76.
---
 I wish we could get human meat from other players we killed. Like in rust with fingers. 
---
It would be cool if we could craft a "radio signal booster" that makes us receive radio stations from past fallout games. I want my spurs to jingle jangle jingle through out the west virginian mountains   
---
I finished this at lv 98. All of them were level 9.
---
Apex predator known for flying but is weak on the ground? Sounds like any animal that does well in it's environment. As a bloodied melee build it only takes about 12 shots from a 1* bloodied lever action to bring down a lvl 65 SB. The only real problem I face is how quickly my rifle degrades. I can't tell you how many times that rifle has broke while I'm trying to solo 4 SB's leaving me yelling "LAND YOU COWARDS!" While trying to dodge mobs and sonic spam. Until one of them does land. I've noticed though if there are 3 or more and half of them land and die the other half strictly stays airborne if you continue to dodge the attacks they'll fly off.
---
According to the time stamp it looks like it was 2 hours ago.
---
Nuka Grape vendor on 2nd Floor Main Building (full rad removal and health regen).  Sulfur water cures diseases gazebo near tennis court (no more glowing pustules). Emote "come here" when legendaries are found if others are around and do not kill.  Molotovs, not grenades.
---
Thank you! I did not make any build (unfortunately) but I will use tennis court. 
---
Yeah, you're not missing anything. 
---
Hah, it's not like this inconsistency is going to keep me awake at night. But they DID leave Jet out of Fallout 76, and there is no problem with getting your lore correct. Helps with game immersion. I can only point something out and ask politely that it be fixed. If it never is, well too bad. But that's no reason not to try and fix something.
---
The garden next to the clubhouse door is also a safe spot.  You can actually get in melee range but be out of their range from there. 
---
I think Petco offers training classes.
---
The station that spits songs right up your ears
---
Bethesda have created a beautiful and rich environment filled with lore. I've just completed the Mistress of Mysteries quest line; quite a sad story. Again the Responder narrative was a tragedy; people trying to salvage and rebuild their lives. I've only really begun exploring the Savage Divide at L60, when I'd pretty much settled on my character build and could hold my own, but I'm really looking forward to learning more about the Raiders and how they came to be.
---
There are of course a few nuances, more notably in the form of players who don't really care to "play" the game, but hopefully that'll be addressed in the next update. That said I've had some great experiences with other players, which in actual fact outweigh the negatives. I'm still a solo campaigner at heart, and I'm not really one for chat (it kinda disrupts the immersion for me) and yet I've found that I've been able to team up with others to pool resources, share workshops etc, whilst still maintaining that solo experience.
---
I only hope that the teams at Bethesda haven't been left  too disheartened by the nevative feedback/reviews and continue to throw their time and energy into what is a very enjoyable game. 
---
I wish they stacked. I kind of image my melee character getting bigger and stronger with stacking STR and END buffs when I pop item after item for heals as swarm after swarm of glowing ghouls pour over him. Like a post apocolypse Hulk.
---
San Antonio. 
---
Atlanta
---
Yellowstone 
---
New Orleans
---
Savannah, Georgia/Charleston, SC maybe in one map
---
Buffalo
---
Seattle/Cascade Mountains
---
Quebec 
---
Winnipeg 
---
Anchorage
---
Maybe also a way to find out if the players that are close are engaged in the event.  Some events need additional players if you're low level like me.
---
Last night there were 2 events at Poseidon at the same time and one player there but i couldn't tell if he was in one or the other or neither.
---
This pretty much
---
I thought the Cannibal perk worked on player corpses? I could swear I saw a PVP guy teasing his opponents he killed by using it on their bodies...
---
Farm whitesprings and sbq.
---
Ironclad, barbarian, junk shield, refractor, evasive, and mutations. 
---
Haven‚Äôt encountered one yet so I didn‚Äôt know there were. 
---
You'll end up with more gears than screws and more screws than springs. I ended up with about 400 gears before I realized the number was not going down, no matter what I did. I use PA so I need more springs than someone that does not, but I think capping out at 100 is pretty safe.
---
Tancels successfully found a chainsaw flamer mod, a 3 star crossbow, and other items for me. Great hire! 
---
&gt; C) Is the story skippable 
---
This just boggles my mind because I play games FOR the story. I couldn't possibly give a shit less about PvP. I want an amazing, immersive story. If people want to skip the story and just go PvP, why the hell are they even playing the game? Go play one of the shit ton of battle royale games out there and stop griefing the rest of us because the game isn't what YOU think it should be.
---
NOTE: I don't mean you personally. The royal "you". :)
---
Seriously, why's it so shitty?  Also, chainsaw.  A freaking CHAINSAW doesn't do as much as a baseball bat I think.  What were they thinking?
---
Hey, male characters can wear dresses, that option is already there.
---
More like a ping time than a benefit
---
Didn‚Äôt know it didn‚Äôt protect from disease. That‚Äôs useless. I kinda feel that Bethesda missed out on providing secret unground areas you have to reach by diving underwater. Of course, I‚Äôve never actually checked or heard anyone that has. 
---
Great experience until it starts crashing every 10 minutes. Maybe about time I give the game another go though.
---
What weapons are you looking for? I'm just on a continual hunt for radium rifles and the drop rate on them is terrible! If you're on ps4 I'd help you get some!
---
I‚Äôm pretty much only PVE. Melee is easier. It‚Äôs less rough on the gear and kills faster. Certainly for leveling and general questing. 
---
You know what is nice about Blocker and Traveling Pharmacy? The 15% or so passive boost to melee damage they come with.
---
Wow this place really has it is own jargon. I already feel excited. I will follow the manners and thank you, I will use every advice. 
---
build a camp right behind the gold club with dozens of turrets! people love seeing those and will probably drop you a 2 shot explosive weapon as a gift..... /s
---
but seriously, I find sneaking and utilizing the sneak attack and instigating weapons is great if you are soloing it
---
be sure to use rad-x before engaging as alot of high level ghouls give alot of rad damage
---
eventually you will be able to know where all the enemies will spawn and be able to sneak around killing everything so that the mobs wont overpower you
---
if they DO overpower you, remember ghouls doent have any ranged attacks!  you can get up on a high vantage where they cant hit you and take them out that way
---
also, you can attack cars with 1 hit from a strong shishkebob and make the cars explode easily, sometimes it helps take out mobs
---
have fun!
---
I've seen some cool things as well.  That's how I got the idea to have a water purifier inside my house.  I tend to find some nice builds above Blackwater mine and at Solomon's pond.  
---
I completely agree. Maybe it was an oversight 
---
Yes, Did you write this post a month ago and just post it now? Did you even read my post? Can you understand this simple question? Let me make it easier on you. I am asking if you typed this post a month ago and forgot to post it?  And two hours ago you saw that you had not posted it a month ago, when you actually typed it up, and then decided to post it today?
---
Mostly you avoid getting hit, but there's Ironclad/Evasive/Barbarian. You can also stack damage reduction from Lone Wanderer, Blocker and Dodgy, and throw in Serendipity.
---
Even with no relevant perks at all, it's not much different to visiting Whitesprings at level 20 anyway.
---
If you don't like dying then the easy option is just to put on some PA for nuke zones. It's not like wearing PA needs any perks at all.
---
Now that I said that I'm search everywhere for a pic of one but can't find one. I remember because I was on this kick of taming animals and thought maybe I could get the little dude to go to my camp. It was across the river by flatwoods and wasn't like a normal looking iquana. Light color and all goofed up. 
---
*ears perk up at mention of green stuff, snorts and shuffles over to adrkhrse*
---
I might start saying TP instead :) 
---
It does I just want y'all's fingers :)
---
Same here.
---
I‚Äôll have to pack a lunch and beer and go find one now. 
---
Do you provide your customers with the proper Truth in Lending Act paperwork. 
---
Xbox. Can't remember exactly but I'm pretty sure it was +50 limb dmg, faster reload, and something with VATs. But again I would have to confirm when I get back on. 
---
They could perhaps put everyone's name in the bottom corner of everyone who is in the event like when you're in a team. 
---
Also, is it a Legendary, it gives the Legendary splash screen, but doesn't have any stars?
---
Also missing the frame drum. 
---
Don‚Äôt know if it matters, but this has been brought up with the devs on Reddit and they are aware. Said they would suggest it. We may see it come up in the next patch or 2. 
---
Personally, I‚Äôve now lost 5 or 6 guns from either selling, dropping, or glitch. Last week lost a furious Gatling. FML. 
---
It‚Äôs all the same in the end. I‚Äôd rather use a downed motorcycle and fast travel with that. Surely one survived the nukes being nuclear powered and all. 
---
Ahaha I saw sarcasm too late. Thank you I will definitely have some fun. I also have marsupial to jump around but I have nothing related to sneak unfortunately. 
---
"Sure, ill join the fun"
---
~equips crossbow and shoots~
---
"Nope"
---
When people talk about time periods they don't always do so with exact accuracy, people saying "something happened 20 years ago" don't always mean "something happened exactly 20 years ago", now if they had given an exact date I would be with you sort of...the destruction of civilization does allow room for an 'unreliable' narrator.
---
Nobody would wear anything else if they could wear legendaries under a hazmat suit. Imagine a full Sentinel set with radiation immunity.
---
I agree. It's probably why I've enjoyed it and don't even get why it's so panned (other than the bugginess). I didn't expect much of this game except for being able to explore and find notes and stuff about story (Cause I didn't want a MP game and wasn't caring about all that shit. I was going to play it for the exploration in spite of it being an MP game. And I love all the notes as exposition on the story. And the backstory to the area is pretty interesting and the notes even about different people/companies help give you a bigger picture).
---
I have been looking for bos combat armor legs and arm plans for awhile. Only had one guy that had the the legs and he was delusional with his price and trades he would take. I know these became rarer with last update, but he wanted 7k or 3* unyielding armor and not the armor I had. My brother in law only paid 1.5k for his leg plan! I'd be willing to pay around 2k each, if you could find them for me. 
---
It spawned where the squirrels spawn. So if you see those maybe server hop and it will be an iguana instead. 
---
&gt; MireLurk King hordes are also no joke.
---
I and my instigating super sledge disagree.
---
You Know!!   They could just extend the boundaries of White Springs club house so you cant place camp in Turret range of the back door of the Club House.??  Isn't this possible?   Just a suggestion.  
---
&gt; I'm a heavy gun build
---
Not anymore
---
Yes!!!!
---
It may be happening tonight everyone is welcome to join and find out. I have a huge collection of alcohol too so maybe party at my camp after. 
---
LOL
---
That is the truth! I've entire factories balanced precariously on a single staircase.
---
What evidence do you have of that? 
---
That‚Äôs good to hear for server stability. Thanks
---
This one here is the best reply IMO.
---
Do you accept the new charge card? I picked it up from a guy and he said all the vendors accept it. 
---
&gt; let perception increase ranged damage would be a good start.
---
Except that would hamstring shotguns pistols and heavy weapons. Basically any ranged that isn't a rifle.
---
Harper's Ferry isn't that far from Washington DC. Less than 2 hours by car, train or monorail. Morgantown to Pittsburgh is similarly pretty close. In either case, post-apocalyptic travel should be rough, but we're already walking and sprinting across West Virginia. 
---
Ok great! Just to be clear you‚Äôre looking for plans, yes? Any of the BOS combat armor plans?
---
No thats a low hp build. U won't get max dmg otherwise I believe.
---
Missed this post but if you launch another I‚Äôll join ;) 
---
That‚Äôs not too bad I guess as say crashing servers.. I heard happening around release date week/month?
---
No
---
yes typos are amusing. It should have been grasp.
---
I've been having the same problem trying to find these Plans. Here's a YouTube video from December that shows exactly where they used to be: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQOapLavEDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQOapLavEDE)
---
The glowing ghouls at end buildings of golf shoppes and little homes at the whitespring are almost always great for looting legendarys. I looted 2 star explosive 5mm minigun and 3 star marine armor there.
---
Sweet. How‚Äôs Morgantown as a nuke zone? I did a random area last night near harpers ferry just to see what it‚Äôs like. 
---
Yes.
---
You came across as a smug asshole. Your next post confirmed my suspicion.
---
Explosive ammo sounds stupid........change my mind.
---
If you are on PC I can sell you some steel. I have more than I could possibly know what to do with and I really need to clear out my stash some. I have like 3k steel I could sell if you want.
---
Thank you!  I wanted it to look like a pawn shop with all the safes stacked up in the back!
---
**gets a new weapon as an event reward**
---
*SHISHKABOB*
---
No special stats but you treat it like it's something special, and it's not that special. I agree, buff it.
---
yup!
---
Just curious what weapon were you using as a heavy gunner?
---
Just last night I killed a few 2 star and 1 3 star legendary that left no loot able body behind.....
---
they recently made it impossible to find the explosive prefix on energy weapons. so if you see someone with one it is a legacy weapon. 
---
Maybe the best post i've read on this community! I often long for FO76  when at work, planning ahead for what to do when i get the chance to play it. Hope to see you out there. 
---
my low level method!  Good stuff
---
Yepp ive been getting frequent disconnects this past week. And of course the ever famous spinning infinite loading loot. Now i know it's not my own network or my PS4. I run the game on an SSD on a fairly decent 300mb fiber network. This is for sure something to do with the servers.
---
Licensing music isn‚Äôt cheap. 
---
Hit everything with a hammer till it dies... at least that‚Äôs what I did back when I farmed whitespings 
---
Yeah, it's in a document called,  "I lend you this and you stay alive by paying it back".
---
Yes, I want the plans. I have the BOS chest just need BOS arms and legs plans. I will be ecstatic if you could get them for me. Thanks in advance.
---
I just found that out. 
---
Well I need a hammer for it üòÇ
---
The game already has free-to-play elements lmao.
---
What did you THINK the atom store was? Get ready for paid mods and XP boosters, buddy.
---
Nah, that's someone elses loan business!
---
I use a sneak style. Facing the front of the building I start at the side door on the left. Disarm the trap and then clear our the cafeteria room. Starting this way allows you to not agro the mobs in the bar area at the same time. Clear out the top floor and then clear the bottom. Make sure you enter the building stealthed as you can actually agro the windego on the bottom floor. If this happens, run and get on the wall. The wendigo will drag every ghoul out of the building with it. 
---
I have two of these just waiting for that energy wepons buff.
---
Wouldn't it be wild if they made the Ballistic Fist cost shotgun ammo for each hit?
---
Awe, is someone upset that they look dumb? I hope your life gets better.
---
No problem! It‚Äôs a really helpful way of build crafting without wasting a lot of time. 
---
I go and lure them out to the parking lot and either pick them off from the top of the bus or the wall by the pool...or hop to the opposite side on to the awning and shoot them all congregating at the windows...
---
Once that building is clear, I'll run past the tennis courts and typically something big will spawn (Deathclaw, Grafton Monster, Yao Guai, etc) - Kill that.  Move on to the entrance area for the resort building and hop on the little bushes/roof thing, blow up a few vehicles in that big garage area...pick off all the ghouls...
---
Run across the road to the fire station, hop up on the roof, blow up a car or two in front of the multi-story house with the car port and pick off all the ghouls leaving.  Typically always a Glowing One from inside as well...
---
For the queen I kind of spam nuka and sugar or coffee for ap. Thats the only fight whre it might get close ap wise
---
Leave weapons alone (except energy weapon condition please fix that!), balance armor instead.
---
Armor should block damage really well from Melee or Energy or Ballistic and do absolutely nothing for the other types, or it can resist all 3 but not nearly as good as the specialized armor.
---
Let's make up some numbers and arbitrarily attach them to armor types for an example.
---
Level 50 leather should have a resistance spread of M 0, E 100, B 0.
---
Metal has a spread of 0, 0, 100
---
Raider has a spread of 100, 0, 0.
---
Combat is 30, 30, 30 and Marine is 50, 50, 50.
---
I think this would create a niche for all armors and weapons in both PVE and PVP. 
---
I've been looking for a TSE or Furious Explosive Submachine gun and the BOS paint plans for the Power Armor. 
---
I had 3 heavy weapons.  50 cal Executioner's when enemies were low.  50 Cal TSE.  TS Laser Gatlin.  I mainly used the laser gatlin on trashy enemies.  If I needed to bring out the TSE 50 cal I would since that was my hard hitting gun.  The Executioner's was really there if  my TSE broke which rarely happened with Weapon Artisan, Gunsmith x 5, and Luck of the Draw x 3.
---
You can actually use a bush to get up on the wall surrounding the pool. This is my default fallback when shit goes sideways.

Mutation: scaley skin

Perks: ironclad, dodgy, serendipity, gun fu, evasive

Bethesda member:  ‚ÄúRemember Daryl from the Walking Dead?‚Äù
---
Bethesda team: ‚ÄúYeah let‚Äôs put a crossbow in the game!‚Äù
---
Wait so my tse gauss rifle is a legacy weapon?
---
It is muh baby...  If not, my precious...
---
Probably this way because melee was pretty close to garbage in past Fallout games. xD
---
I still much prefer ranged combat, so that has the benefit of being the most fun. Whereas my melee weapon is less fun but does high damage, so it has the benefit of being the most effective for killing. 
---
Two different advantages. I've used melee for the last 20 levels or so, mostly because I just happened to find a 3\* deathclaw gauntlet, but I plan to go back to ranged as soon as I can find a decent legendary pewpew.
---
In the end I think it works out fairly well because this is a non-competitive game. There's no reason to feel pressured to use the 'optimal' damage dealer. Just do what you like and if the next guy is dealing more damage, who really cares? Are you staring at a damage meter or getting chewed out by your GM? xD
---
Assuming you meet reqs, have 8g + ram, and an SSD/NVMe/Raid/HDD that isn't shit, it's definitely servers slowing you down.
---
On the occasions where my connection was strong fast traveling felt like straight up teleporting, &lt;10 seconds depending on the target.
---
I've noticed during nukes and other events that punish the server, load screens do seem to take longer. To be expected though, I'm fairly sure the client needs to fetch certain things server side before it drops the player there, longer queue longer wait. 
---
On the upside, this was less of an issue when I hopped on for a day last week. Seems they're aware of it.
---
This was my heavy gunner build.  He hit hard but like I said, I got tired of the ammo grind.

---
Morgantown rivals whitesprings with the number of bloated glowing ones that spawn, but there‚Äôs not as many legendaries unfortunately. It‚Äôs still a great spot to nuke for xp and get a few legendaries as well as mix things up from the usual whitesprings/fissure site prime nuke runs 
---
It does the same damage as any of my rifles and I imagine it‚Äôs more silent...
---
Ah. I used a Gatling gun for awhile being that 5mm was weightless for me. But that‚Äôs a many levels ago. 
---
I do have scaly skin.  Forgot to put that in.  The only perk I don't have in my build is gun fu.  That works for DG?  
---
Yes to the ice machine. Did a nuke run last night and we filled that thing with around 100 1\*'s.
---
Wow, you clearly didnt read the whole post. Lmao
---
Exactly. I can run through alpha and use 1 Furious Heated Sharp Sledgehammer and about 100 rounds of 5.56 in my TSE Handmade (turrets) and still go to whitesprings with my first sledgehammer (i have 2 identical ones, 320 damage and growing) and pound out a couple laps.
---
They nerfed the hell out of everything else besides melee.
---
Nah, fam, I did. I'm saying the game was rigged from the start.
---
If you are a sniper and don't use sneaking in PVP you are doing the build wrong. Bloodied sniper builds rely on sneak bonus damage, and the mister sandman perk for even more damage from sneak. Sneak is one of the biggest parts of that build.
---
What if they asked their community to submit music and sort through and play the selected tracks for free so the musician that's also a fan of the games would get free publicity? 
---
Yeah, I liked the laser gatlin because of it running on fusion cores.  just take over a couple of power plants for an hour or so you'd get around 20 fusion cores.  good enough for a couple days.  
---
So you never really had any input?
---
You just wanted to try and make someone look dumb on the internet?
---
LOL...... keyboard warriors.
---
Oh my sleepy eyes missed that. I use a crossbow occasionally with my sniper and it‚Äôs great for stealth. Horrible to aim while chameleoned tho
---
The struggle is real. I finally was able to unload a lvl 20 3 star auto pipe rifle i had modded to the hilt. Was turned down/ignored/fled from by 4 players before someone decided to engage.
---
BTW,  I messaged each one, so it isnt like I snuck up on them.
---
I used to think that too because the weights reported in the pip-boy say that many bulk items weigh more, but actually test it and you'll find that bulked items weigh less. You cannot trust the tool-tip weights. 
---
What would you swap out for gun fu?
---
Yeah, that's not what I am referring to, I know Legendary enemies do that, but I am talking about everything else gaining heath back
---
i do not know if the gauss counts. but i know laser rifle/pistol, plasma rifle/pistol, gatling laser, gatling plasma, flamer, cryolator, Tesla rifle and other energy weapons cannot be found as an explosive prefix anymore.. at least until they "fix it"
---
Terminal seems like the easiest way to implement this.
---
In FO4 you got the vault settlement manager terminal. Already in the lore. Make it happen Bethesda.
---
Wonderful art direction, and at times beautiful scenes (usually when time of day and weather come together nicely). A pretty large world that has a lot more variance than past Fallouts. Great soundtrack. Somewhat deeper crafting/legendary system compared to past Fallouts (unmodded past Fallouts of course, lol).
---
My fingers are crossed that Nuclear Winter is a PVE hardmode. That would really make my day and remove one of my top criticisms, that the game is a bit too easy (especially when you play with friends). Couple that with a few camp upgrades, like turning world loot into decor and hopefully some budget increases, and I'll be in heaven for awhile. ;-)
---
GTK üëçüèæ
---
Hazmat, avoid melee, and let your friends do the heavy lifting. If you want to do a nuke zone by yourself you should do it in power armor.
---
Does heavy trapper armor exist? I thought it only came in the sturdy variety.
---
Fair. I only carry 3core at anytime. 
---
I'd be happy just being able to change the station on my damn jukebox in my house.  Why is it locked to CLASSICAL???
---
^^this. But if you are dealing with normal grass I recommend using concrete blocks and having them be higher than the grass so it is elevated, and just building stairs up to your doorway 
---
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
---
fair enough seeing as im a bloodied melee build üòÇ 
---
What? You do realize VATS is the only way you could attack things in the original fallouts, right? 
---
Bulking does reduce weight. It doesn't show in the per-item weight displayed in the pip-boy, but try making 10 bulk items and watch how much your combined character-and-stash weight drop. 
---
Typos are funny 
---
\*bobs Chally head to the post-apoc Biggie rhymes\*
---
Not on the Rifles, My Primary Weapon is now an Instigating DC Gauntlet (1240 1st Hit, 860 after), with an instigating Death Tambo as a back-up (Unarmed), I also carry a 4\* Machete for when I'm in PA which is rare (only for Rad resistance).
---
I do still use Rifles, TSE Handmade, TSE Lever, Exp. Hunting Rifle, and also carry an Explosive Combat SG, but mainly due to Durability reasons they are no longer my Primary Weapons. The DPS on High Fire rate Rifles is still very viable, but the reduced durability introduced by the nerf, and routine repair costs have rendered them unreliable for sustained use.
---
For SBQ battles, and occasionally for other Blast Zones, I use a Furious Exp. Gatling, or TSE 50 Cal. but the weight and durability make both of those impractical for routine use.
---
Hazmat Suit+Barbarian, Blocker, Ironclad, Evasive, Dodgy, Lone Wanderer (If solo), Bodyguard (if in team), and Serendipity if you have enough luck.
---
I also stock up on Nuka-Orange (with Cola Nut) and Glowing Bloodpacks for extra Rad Resist.
---
Because I see other players and visit their camps
---
You have nailed the pawn shop owner look, haha. 
---
Also great job with detailing. My next big build is planned to be more metal/modern than my past ones, so this will be a nice inspiration!
---
Read reply above.
---
You're completely ignoring that I dont actually and never did believe the game would go F2P. This post was an experiment to show the subreddit would latch on to any negative spin on things, no matter how made up or outlandish. It proved my point.
---
What type of armor? I‚Äôve got a metal right arm and leather left arm.
---
You can land crits without VATS, same with headshots, you just have to actually aim for the head. The only thing you can do with VATS you can't do with manual aiming is FORCE a crit when you have it banked. But you can do the same exact thing with melee builds as well. 
---
This reminds me of a game called Elex no one really gave it a high review rating, but I got it and really enjoyed the game. 
---
The review is someone else's OPINION not fact. Just because they hate/dislike the game doesn't me you won't like it. From launch till now people say this is the worst game ever, it's horrible, it's broken. I personally love fallout 76, being able to run around with my dad and brother or meet new players and gift them stuff and help them. 
---
Meatal
---
I have not tried deep diving with it yet but it can be handy escaping enemies when you are lower level. 
---
Prime and ultracite plans are rare drops from scorchbeasts. Yesterday I got the prime 10mm pistol plan.
---
I found you can place your CAMP behind the house across the road from Green Country Lodge. I built onto the side of the existing house, which looks pretty snazzy. As a bonus, I look to see if anyone has cleaned out the weight room every time I log in. And it's a short walk down to the Responders vendor in Flatwoods. 
---
I can take this right give me your psn 
---
Please. Tbh this would probably bring me back sooner. I'm just kinda waiting on some more content right now.
---
I think it has 10% damage while aiming
---
I won‚Äôt say anything else! 
---
Maybe some people like to play the game without being given hand outs.  Being given a strong weapon at the start would suck, your ttk would go up as you out levelled it.
---
It's easier to switch builds when you don't min max. 
---
Yeah, I tried all the attachments to see which one I like and the nozzles are absolute trash for how much they reduce range. The Napalm canister is all I'm able to put on for the canisters. I have LOTD rank one but am using my next two levels for that. The fuel is only difficult for me because of the acid, but I'm gonna move my base to a deposit for more, the rest of the materials aren't too big of a problem,... yet.
---
If so that means it couldn't have explosive 
---
First thought: "I recognize those photos. This guy stole those photos!"
---
Second thought: "Oh it's the same guy. Fuck yeah stay filthy!"
---
legendary T pose
---
\^THAT\^ You will find that to be correct. Bulk it, it will weigh less overall.
---
You probably want to advertise in  r/fo76bazaar they advertise everything there.
---
Oh and the appleachia radio too!
---
I have a shish, 40% faster swing speed and furious. I used it for ages on my 1h build and it was awesome, till I realised 2h is far superior 
---
Agreed, except Heavy guns should be Endurance, imo.
---
END needs some love.
---
i have an explosive flamer...odd weapon, but cool.
---
It‚Äôs not you. There‚Äôs a lot of weapons that need some love at this point. 
---
More distinguishing properties for a lot of the melees would be a start. Right now there‚Äôs no difference in how say a sickle performs vs a tire iron other than damage. No reason not to use whatever does the most damage. It‚Äôs bad balance imo 
---
Pair me with a fellow sniper...
---
I just posted about this - I think there's a bug where if you fast travel to the blast zone before the nuke arrives, the ambient radiation doesn't change much, if at all. I almost always go to watch the explosion, then I can pop a Rad-X and be fine. No Hazmat suit or perks. I've done it multiple times. If I travel to the zone *after* the explosion, then I have problems.
---
For the golf club, I stand at the coat rack at the top of the stairs, so that I get a view of mobs coming from both floors. Also, only 2-3 can ever be on me if I‚Äôm in the corner and some will nicely stand and watch along the railing. With Blocker 3 and PA, I don‚Äôt mind them wailing on me. But, they can push me around, especially if one gets behind me. 
---
Be prepared to use a better choke point if you end up with all glowing ones. Standing behind the counter in the gift shop might funnel guys one at a time.
---
Maybe. We still need a way to communicate other than mic.
---
Now you‚Äôre being crazy. 
---
I‚Äôd love a quiver option for fast load, scope, maybe heavy draw instead of quiver or more damage ... 
---
well i cant use rad-x because it would suppress all my mutations :(
---
How 1200
---
I switch from melee to heavy guns and put on the power armor. 
---
Trying to run a bloodied melee in a nuke zone without power armor is... challenging. Radsponge keeps you alive but wimpy. 
---
Hmmm maybe the owl mask I‚Äôve seen I think on this sub once or twice 
---
I enjoyed it a lot until Bethesda fucked the Text Chat mod up and haven't added official text chat. Haven't played it since.
---
I had a nocturnal shishkebab in fallout 4 that was actually good at peak night hours. 
---
Nocturnal in FO4 increased damage by 100%, whereas it caps at 50% in 76. 
---
It was still niche but became quite usable under the right conditions. 
---
The should buff effects like nocturnal and berserkers back to FO4 values. Right now they‚Äôre not really strong enough to use on a normal build
---
I think there's a collaborative relationship between that monster, the mire tentacles, and the scorched.
---
It's no coincidence to me that the scorched and those heart tentacle things are right next to each other on the map, the bog and mire are basically the same ecological system with one having more trees and thus tentacle like roots.  The scorched derived from the main nest in the bog at the glassed caverns.  They persist underground.  The tentacles appear to persist underground but what's more they have a symbiotic relationship with trees, one tree in 25 years at most grew through the highway ground and exploded in size with those tentacles all through it.  The tentacles seek out life and parasitically take over, this becomes symbiotic with trees and plant life but appears like the scorched plague on animal life only their connection is through a heart hub with tendrils connecting them like a weird halo flood hive mind.
---
The scorched do something similar but with ultracite being a resonator for scorchbeast vibrations to control them.
---
They might be two sides of the same coin, two variations on the same theme and problem.  The mire tentacles wreck havoc on manmade structures and improve tree life.  The scorched are a force of destruction with only their own growth being their improvements, probably out of anger of being painfully mutated and used for another group's (envlave) plans.
---
The tentacles and scorched probably have some connection due to their similarities.
---
That sleeping monster is probably related to that all possibly.
---
And you never know, those tentacles could be like mycelium from mushrooms, can only grow and thrive in wet dark climates, so the mire as even the bog is bright, and mycelium from mushrooms also symbolically attach to plant roots to feed them in return for nutrients, only in this mire's case they attach to living beings to protect the 'heart' as it grows.
---
There's also the possibility that the mire situation is also hostile towards scorched, so that both the tentacles and scorched are vying for control over the other which is why the scorched plague hasn't gone full Halo's The Flood mode because they're contending against another hive mind.
---
Banjo likes the crossbow. How do you get prime receiver?
---
That would be a good idea.  The game has had that in the past and now we go  Multiplayer and it's gone. Players that prey on others should have more  consequences.
---
This is by far the most annoying event in the entire game. I did it once with 2 others but I will *never* do it again. Being constantly insulted the entire time. The speaker is louder than my shotgun. And the feral ghouls spawned non stop. Took two of us just to keep them in check while the 3rd ran around looking for centerpieces that aren't marked. Got crappy rewards for completing it 100%. No thanks. I seriously place this even below swarm of suitors which I haven't even been able to complete due to bugs. At least I got a lot of XP killing the 'lurks. 
---
well it has explosive so ill have to check XD at work so I must be remembering wrong XD
---
In the F76 guide book it says the 9 others are there and there are pictures, so either they cut them last minute or there is some sort of glitch, or they've saved them for later.
---
I want to believe they have something planned for this... keyword being want
---
Thing was a god gun in 3/NV. It makes me so sad to see it in its current state
---
im just gonna use power armour im usually only playing in a group of 2 (3max) and none of them have radsponge sadly
---
There are so many other things more important that needs to be addressed first.
---
Honestly, I'm not sure it's even necessary when the bug happens. I've done it just out of paranoia, but take zero rad damage in the blast zone.
---
XD you probably are XD don't worry though XD
---
Metal i can take 
---
The rest of these I'll agree with, but J should be a standard we pay more attention to.
---
Representation matters, and folks that haven't been traditionally included in games should be given space at the gaming table.
---
ill try it but im pretty sure it‚Äôs never worked for me before.
---
This is an 18+ game with mature themes you shouldn't be letting your kid play it.
---
All I remember was like!! WOW this is gonna be great imma prime it and put those focusing parts on and do some real damage! Whir, PEW, PEW, PEW, PEW, PEW, CLUNK!!!! BROKE?!?!
---
At least you noticed this before you logged off...
---
Having to decide what to carry... it's good actually. It's like living in a small apartment. Either you hoard and have no room to move around OR you are constantly getting rid of stuff you don't need and welcoming new and different things. 
---
I like suddenly just getting rid of a bunch of guns I've been carrying around and getting something entirely new
---
I think people saying this is a simulation are taking the crazed, paranoid raving of a scientist trapped in a bomb shelter during a nuclear apocalypse far too seriously. Reading the email, he SOUNDS completely nuts.
---
The grafitti saying "nothing is real" isn't really convincing, since it is in a city in sight of massive insane asylum that was shut down and released all it's inmates.
---
The robobrain with the sign that says "unplug me" is PROBABLY just a prank, or maybe the brain suffered a psychotic break as robobrains are wont to do, realized what it was, and wants to die.
---
I don't think it is a simulation for several meta reasons.
---
1. It devalues all real and perceived player achievements and progress. You think we are going to wake up from our memory lounger, and have all the loot and progress we found in the simulation? No.
---
2. If we were ever to leave the simulation, it would render the entire world that has been built utterly wasted. Unless we step out of the simulation into a world exactly the same as the one in the simulation, in which case why bother with making it a simulation at all?
---
3. From a storytelling perspective, it makes no sense. There are no hints of it being a simulation in the actual narrative except one email from a paranoid crazy person. "It was all a dream" has no connection to the existing theme and story of the narrative, so throwing that in would make no sense and derail the story.
---
A more likely situation would be outsiders from beyond Appalachia begin to filter in, and populate the wastes with NPCs that lead to more of us "Reclaiming and rebuilding America" per the game's tagline.
---
I spent some time with wood armor and a crossbow being a sniper in the Mire.  Good times.  Would love to see a scope and some mods like quick firing, barbed (more damage less range), etc.  
---
I agree that there are issues that need to be addressed first, but for future content a new Pip-Boy app would be awesome
---
Because we're not wizards. We don't magically have second sight.
---
where can i get nuka orange i‚Äôve never even seen it üòÇ. Also, does the rad resist stack?
---
Anti Armor weapons, aimed at their thruster takes them out quickly, if you don't have an AA weapon, then using a perforating magazine helps, and the Tank killer perk makes a huge difference.
---
I see the plans for  Sturdy Combat arms/legs/chest all the time with one of the vendors in watoga, if not, server hop :)
---
I do think you have a great idea. Players like you is why I love this game.
---
Yeah!!!
---
Bugs?  Most are fixed, some are not.  Kind of on par with Fallout 3 and NV.
---
This is a good idea. 
---
It was off a random scorchbeast in the Cranberry Bog, no event
---
Where are your perks, one or two-handed melee? That should guide you on which melee weapon to keep (sell the rest. If you're not carrying them regularly, you never will). If your'e two handed, why don't you have the All Rise yet? Any firearms perks at all - non-auto/auto rifle, handgun, energy? Same idea.   
---
Also, how heavy is your armor, and do you sneak around scavenging or are you more of a leeroy jenkins? The Black Powder Rifle is heavy as hell and slow to reload - unless you're a sniper carefully setting up one shot, it's going to be a boat anchor for you.
---
Reposting 100X daily? Ewww, gross. You noobs don't realize the prestige system will fix this stop whining already.
---
Scorchbeast and Queen drops.  Random.  
---
I'm still trying to find windmill plans
---
I have farmed a lot of gear in Whitesprings with nothing but a hazmat suit &amp; marsupial mutation.  Drop down, drop them out, shoot them, jump up, shoot them as they run away, drop down again.  Pretty easy, actually.
---
Only in the first Fallout game is that the case with the chunk variant, but actual iguanas exist. They're quite clearly visible on a stick in the same game.
---
For whatever reason, Bethesda opted to finally introduce squirrels after squirrel bits were another dubious meat from an unseen animal, but iguanas remain hidden.  They should probably add some iguanas at some point.
---
I think it's a little bit more:
---
Bethesda - "Here's our product give us some input about it "
---
Me- "This upsets me because....."
---
Other Customer - "You have no right to have opinions!"
---
It's a shame, the Gatling plasma is a real nice looking, sounding and performing weapon the but the condition makes it ni on impossible to use 
---
Bicycles need to be in this game, imagine cycling away from a deathclaw, haha 
---
I think the biggest issue is just that EVERY SINGLE ENEMY is hyper resistant to energy damage. Same issue with weapons that do radiation damage. The way resistances are calculated, it's just so much more effective to be throwing ancient slugs at enemies than to use the hyper advanced superheated light blasters. Like, sure, splitting the damage of shishkebabs and plasma weapons is a downside, and I feel a damage buff to those weapons would be a huge boon, but overall energy damage is just vastly inferior to ballistic just because of enemy resistances. Even robots, who are supposed to take extra damage from energy weapons, have a higher resistance to lasers than bullets. There's just no reason to use them aside from flavour, and then you're just gimping yourself.
---
Man, I've been using a Vampiric Shishkebab for such a long time. I'm a crazy super tank, but I do basically no damage.
---
I was just told that you can find them in game now. Gonna go hunt one down for the scrapbook 
---
Like it is now I don't even have to have my quests active as then I need to have like 1/3rd of the screen full of texts. That is great and immersive..right.
---
Yes this bug has been back for a few weeks now.    It certainly happens often enough to notice it but it definitely doesn't happen a majority of the time either from my experience.
---
I shoot a mob and its health will drop down to 75% and then instantly rebound back to 90%.   Shoot the mob again and it drops down to 65% then the health rebound happens and its back up to 80% and so on.  I then start to shoot quicker and it just exacerbates the problem and something that should have died in 3 hits takes 12.    I have found that if I do slow the amount of damage I'm trying to inflict the health rebound will stop sometimes although this definitely doesn't work all the time.
---
This is an old problem and it did go away for a time but it is certainly back and has been for a few weeks.
---
At work now so I can't test. But can you test the following:
---
I've noticed that Nuka Cola can spawn in one of 5 states:
---
\- No spawn
---
\- Empty bottle
---
\- Regular Nuka Cola
---
\- Cherry
---
\- Quantum
---
The additional quantums that spawned, were they in a fixed location that had previously spawned one of the other states and you didn't pick them up? Or did, for example, you pick up a quantum and then had  another quantum spawn in the exact same location? I've noticed that I can go someplace that has an empty bottle, don't pick it up, switch servers and there's a chance that bottle will spawn in one of the other states. You can really test this well at the TNT dome where you get the power armor paint. I kept switching servers until every empty bottle had spawned as one of the flavors and I picked them all up. Once I had picked them all up, no more spawns happened until my personal timer reset.
---
Not if they broke just the same as they do already.  Easy fix. 
---
Ahhh.  Thank you.  Guess I‚Äôll be farming scorchbeasts then.
---
As mentioned, once they're marked as Known, you're good to go forever, no need to keep them. I take all known plans and leave them in the stash at the Overseer's camp (along with ammo and non-perishable food, and water.)
---
I got the AA Power Fist early, so I have rank 3 Incisor, rank 3 Martial Artist, and of course rank 3 Iron Fist.
---
Working on leveling a bunch of Gladiator now because I want to try out some of my 1 handed weapons.
---
I‚Äôm currently only in my lvl 40‚Äôs, but am trying to get crafting materials, as well as disease cures. Is this something you farm for?
---
The issue is your opinion doesn't correlate with the intended implementation of the feature. Not liking other players for using the feature how it was implemented and intended to be used doesn't mean that those players are griefing. 
---
The scrap you can't bulk can be sold to the vendors in their loose form
---
You can sell individual materials that don't bulk.
---
You can sell those without bulking them! 
---
Show me in my post where I even said I don‚Äôt get why everyone else doesn‚Äôt like it? I was just being positive and giving my honest opinion, you‚Äôre just being cynical.. and exploring doesn‚Äôt require spending caps, you walk and make you‚Äôre way through the world like that, why fast travel? If you don‚Äôt like the game then don‚Äôt play it, saves you from looking down on people because they don‚Äôt agree with your cynicism.  
---
You can sell some junk without bulking.  So just sell your silver directly.  Worth 1 or 2 caps a piece. 
---
Empath doesnt get effected by Class Freak. 
---
Adrenaline Reaction is broken. 
---
Not sure about the rest. I don't use the other's. I'll check Carnivore though, i use that. 
---
I once heard that the blue Asylum worker outfit was among the rarest items.
---
Would be cool but probably get you killed. And I don‚Äôt want to tell the overseer what happened. 
---
I have the All Rise, have had it for awhile. I excluded quest weapons from my list. I also have Blade of Bastet and others.
---
Yep you're 100% correct. For as buggy as the game is  they did a ok job of balancing, most builds have counters. I usually get them the first time BUT if they stealth up and I lose my vats headshot magazine dump it turns into a real fun battle. If they dont get close or I dont get lucky with manual aiming it turns into who runs out of stim packs first. Also the invisible glitch bug is very hard to counter. I could never beat a stealth build till I got my own set of assassins sent, I now get the first kill but after that it comes down to who plays the second encounter better.
---
There is no way to make it work / fair. You want bonus for giving ammo to noobs? The griefers will just give it to friends, trade back and forth and abuse the system.
---
Most of you do nothing but grind #'s and live to exploit.

The only meaningful MP karma system was in Fable and it simply turned you into an ugly monster if you were evil. You can't force anyone to role play like this if you don't already RP.
---
We're people. Not NPCs so karma won't work.
---
Its absolutely the servers there's no doubt in my mind I'm going to assume they have the whole team devoted to the first DLC dropping on the 12th and "hopefully" making that drop as smooth as possible because if the first official DLC release is as broken as the past updates have been it will be an absolute nightmare for them
---
You shouldn't tell people how to raise their kids either yet here we are.
---
I‚Äôve never had a crash, sure the game has its moments but for what I‚Äôm looking for it‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs different for every person 
---
Anything that makes recipes more sensible is a good idea.  If I was in charge of balancing food, heck, I might even consider making complex foods immune to spoilage because they're so hard to make, but it's probably better if some recipes have lighter requirements like the ones you mentioned.
---
I made a thread relating to food and how salt, pepper, and spices are not craftable items when they should be, considering that you can make sugar.  Overly complex recipes that offer very little benefit is definitely one of the most prominent problems with cooking, and hopefully they address it.
---
Personally, I wish there was also a perk that gave double the benefits from complex food and drink recipes (more than 4 different ingredients) so as to better incentivize making and consuming them.

Nuka Orange can be bought from Bubbles in Whitesprings.

"If you expect the game to not be remotely close to as advertised, it's good."
---
A'aight.
---
YES! So much this!
---
thank you broski
---
What's your playstyle? There's a good mixture of melee and close range weapons there. Also some non power armor stuff like the power fist and Deathclaw gauntlet  that'll only be any use if you're not wearing PA. Possibly make a second character to try a different kind of game style. Heck, wait until the legendary vendor shows up (next update?) and flog off anything you decide not to keep.
---
Watoga and Harper's ferry vendors 
---
One of the very first trades I made in game was for a TS Gatling, only to have it disappear 24 hours later.  I don't even know if I sold it to a vendor, dropped it by accident or traded it off to someone by accident.
---
Now if I'm selling weapons or armor to a vendor bot I always double check their inventory before I leave.  Just waiting for the day I hit the jackpot, finding something some other poor soul sold off by accident.
---
Two shot is the only primary effect, the others are major and minor effects, according to the wiki.
---
Y'all got any of them sexy harpoon guns? 
---
that would make heavy guns need 3 stats, str end and per

You play Warframe, you know Tennogen? Aspiring 3d artists can submit complete Warframe designs that will be openly sold on the market as skins.
---
Does that make the "mysterious stranger" Neo?

I have *never* played a Fallout game until 76 came out.  I had zero expectations.  I watched my husband play for about 10mins and was like wow,  yeah, i'll buy it!  I LOVE IT! The exploration for sure is fun, finding plans, recipes, weapons. Building your camp, doing the quests and listening to the story lines.  And you're right, interacting with people is awesome.  I've dropped plans and stuff for lower level people, I've been helped out by other people.  I don't mind not having a general chat. If you want to talk to someone, you need to actually walk over there (which helps with exploring on the way) and either emote the crap out of them hehehe or talk if they have a mic.  Either way, it's fun!
---
People are afraid of the gun
---
I think it'd be hard to reach a concensus on what constitutes good and bad behavior. "Trying to take over a workshop" is part of the game. So is stealing in the Fallout games - there's a mechanic for it, but it gets negative karma because while it's part of the game, it's a dick move.  Not much different from breaking into a locked base. You're going to efforts to deprive them of something of value they currently count on. Turrets at Whitesprings? "I was just defending n00bs against hordes of ghouls!" I could see more arguments for that being worth good karma than bad karma.   
---
And what happens if you're shooting into a cluster of ghouls and inadvertently tag another player, leading to some PVP where one dies? Who gets the bad karma? The guy who shot first or the guy that responded? For that matter, how is the game going to determine that you accidentally shot him because he was on the other side of the ghouls versus you deliberately shooting him? Almost any inter-player interaction would be damned near impossible to objectively decide. The game would have to know your motivations and what was going on in your head when the act took place, and that's never going to happen.
---
Amazing. That's basically the holy grail I'm seeking in this game. Thanks for sharing!
---
Because they are internet bullies, they are wimps in real life so they feel the need to use the little bit of game power they might have. Its sad and pathetic really....
---
Indeed. Just now i offered a guu exactly what he wanted and he still refused lol.
---
How old do you think the average Vietnam vet is?
---
Tbf, ghouls have next to no damage or energy resistance. Theyre very much glass cannon enemies unless theyre glowing. The most damage youll get out of it is with instigating/+40%power attack/+strength (since bloodied is buggy with it) and even that is barely touching the 5-600 damage range with a power attack. Not small, but when compared to other melee weapons, it just doesnt stack up.
---
For reference a grognak's with the same effects will go well into the 1000 damage range with a power attack and the instigating proc.
---
Is it just me or should these have been the base prices for this stuff?
---
Now I want chicken fingers, why did this post make me hungry, I must be a monster and not even know it :c
---
Yes i should when they post to a forum with the topic:
---
&gt;Who thinks that's right? 
---
Reddiquette demands that you upvote me. This is the most basic of rules of reddit and debate. Furthermore take up the issue with the ESRB it has nothing to do with me personally.
---
On my Xbox One X with 4K HDR monitor sometimes it makes my eyes bleed it is so good lol
---
Is that 206 dmg *per hit*?? Sweet Mother of Cows, that's... a lot. 
---
Well, you'll sure overcome a lot of damage resistance then &gt;\_&gt; 
---
I try to approach it a little more honorably than that. Usually I'll do a ranged shot with a hunting rifle for slap damage. If the guy fires back I know it's on. If they run I'm not into griefing or trying to bypass slap damage. That's trolling. It's not a perfect system. I really wish the game didn't provide player dots on the compass and map to make it more exciting. Also I have been punished when my foe actually had backup come to help them. Circle of life and all that. 
---
Yeah mij build uses the sneak perks. But it's not always possible to start pvp in sneak mode unless people are wanted.
---
Mr. Fuzzy costume is 450 tokens.
---
Btw not at pc atm so I wouldn't know the exact ones for the vats ar guy. The main thing in there are four lef clover and the vat fil one maxed. I do only use t1 rifle cards to max agility, luck. Of course unyielding pieces (4). Plus my main vats rifle is the assault rifle, bloodied, vats crit increase, vats fill increase. Handmade might be better but this roll is so nice haha.
---
Doing event quests can get you prime reciever plans 
---
Saving for later!
---
Well, you should also move the heavy gun damage perks into END as well, imo.
---
Strength would still be useful for carry weight, of course.  What's the PER benefit for heavy guns? 
---
I get this but some kind of permanence would be nice (favorite server option?). Some consistency would be nice for faction pvp, setting up shop (or vending machine), or just finding that awesome camp somebody else made.
---
There is always the excitement of new exploration but I wouldn‚Äôt hate knowing some of those things above without friending Everton I come across. 
---
Yeah, I'd keep a rifle and/or the M79 and sell anything not one-handed if I were in your position. I'm a sniper; I carry three rifles (varying range, fire rate, and stopping power) and the Blade of Bastet; everything else gets sold to vendors at the end of the day. Any ammo not .308, .45, or 5.56 gets dumped in suitcases at train stations with any known plans and recipes. My stash is only scrapped junk, magazines, bobbleheads, fusion cores, and power armor. No point in getting sentimenal over legendaries if you're just going to keep getting better stuff as you progress.
---
Of all things I thinks I think PA would be tossed together after the war. Just building on a PA frame make a lot more sense then being able to build the most high tech pieces of prewar kit.
---
im glad you (or anyone else) doesnt have the authority to rule over other people's lives. and im super glad that the recommended age restrictions on things are just \*recommendations\* that do two things: they prevent children without adult guidance to purchase things that aren't appropriate without any conversation or guidance but they also allow adults to purchase things for their children that aren't going to physically or mentally harm them (at the adults discretion) for their children.  the point of contention here comes with an arbitrary number at which one feels is "adult" and also blanket rules for games. not all 18+ games are the same. one of my kids started college at age 14. do i tell him he can't do that because it's an adult activity?
---
also not all 18+ games are the same ...would i allow my under 16's to play fallout 4? no! the story based games with mature adult choices and stories are definitely NOT appropriate for children. but fallout 76 is NOT that game. when my kids DO play (the under 18 ones) they run around exploring. They aren't reading any mature themes and usually not engaging in combat except to defend themselves. So they aren't really participating in the mature content.
---
But thanks for the unsolicited parenting advice, anyway. i hope you have a wonderful day.
---
I Agree %100... I don't really get why my vampires pitchfork could do more damage than my shiskabeb like really? 
---
Playstyle right now is charge in with a Powerfist or Deathclaw gauntlet and swing away.
---
I did plan on a second character for a more shooty style.
---
Exactly. I‚Äôm not asking for it to be OP. But there needs to be parody between the same style of weapon. Melee weapons currently consist of the super sledge or the death law gauntlet/powerfist. Anything else and you‚Äôre gimping yourself. 
---
I love it.  There is a turning point in this game where you run from them then you realize that they are just take a lot of damage and don't really issue a lot of damage so at some point you're tanky enough to just beat the living hell out of them.  Now the Queen however, that's a different story.
---
Puts on tinfoil hat. 
---
Maybe someone out there doesn‚Äôt want this visible so they downvote it to bury it.  Can‚Äôt have the media running with a glitch like that. 
---
That helps - I'm a long ways from building up my 3rd character to that point but I have some idea what to do with him now.  2 non-VATS is plenty, my 3rd will be what I call the PAL build (Perception, Agility, Luck).  I think you're thinking of Grim Reaper's Sprint?
---
And you look down on me for disagreeing with your, lack of "cynicism"? Optimism? Call it whatever you like. If you read my comment, I said that I like the game, I play the game for exploration and knowing the story of yet another Fallout game, one of my favorite franchises of all time. This is MY type of fun. The stuff I mentioned prevent me for achieving the level of fun I wanted from this game. I understand, you are a fan of 76. You like the game, you don't give a shit about its issues because it gives YOU the fun YOU need. That doesn't mean it's the same for everyone. You say that people don't explore enough, well, I'm saying there are things that prevent people for exploring. People want to explore Appalachia just like they explored the Capital Wasteland, the Mojave Wasteland and the Commonwealth. If I'm cynical for pointing out the issues preventing people from exploring then damn right I'm a cynical.
---
Cool thanks! Might try that cuz I love looting Morgantown in general as is so I know it pretty well. Might try tonight!
---
They need to expand the food tab badly, cranberries, starlight creeper, firecracker berries, brain fungus, glowing fungus, silt beans, and various things like, soot flowers, bleached dogwood, bloodleaves and snaptail reeds.
---
And possibly honeycombs to place for honey.
---
I highly appreciate your taking time to post this, I bought as many recipes for everything I could, chems and food and overall I'm put off by the recipes.
---
Especially recipes like Honey Crisp without honey, Seasoned Rabbit Skewers without salt, pepper, or spices or even sugar, and Iguana Soup requiring Squirrel.
---
Don't get me started on chem recipes either...
---
Iguana soup is using squirrel bits, too.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It‚Äôs so true. It does the whole ‚Äúepic weapon display when it‚Äôs added to your inventory‚Äù and then you look at the stats and it‚Äôs like wtf?!!
---
I appreciate it, though I‚Äôm not on PS4.
---
Because that would make sense.
---
I'd have mats over most of my C.A.M.P. Maybe Twin Lakes is not as nice a place to build. lol
---
Oh.. well then. We have plain spacesuits. Neither clean nor dirty. They are the inbetweens...
---
Why on Earth don't they all do this until they're dead...
---
I don't think it's a joke. It's just a reference to a mission from F1
---
Gotta wonder who caused that in that person.
---
This would explain why the Vault meant to "rebuild America" was not given a GECK.
---
 The Furious Combat Knife is the nastiest thing you have. Repair it to 200% and go stab stuff.
---
This is the most accurate post about so many people on this subreddit, it's actually disturbing.
---
If you look and it's not there, then it's probably a chameleon instead of an iguana.
---
They could try buffing energy weapons and reducing the cost of vats shots so that it becomes easier to chain ranged attacks. 
---
Aren't vendors impervious to all damage? 
---
I‚Äôm hoping that with Player Vending coming next month we get to bulk Ammo
---
RIGHT??
---
It reminds me of the ‚Äúepic‚Äù treasure hunt that you got led on in the Original Fable. Took you forever to find the clues, figure them out, dig it up. 
---
And it turns out to be a goddamn frying pan. 
---
Yeah I see that, but I'm thinking if ONE thing survives in its prewar state, it's probably power armor right?  We literally take it into nuke zones.  
---
A real store doesn't resort to these shitty practices unless their a franchisee...
---
That makes sense! That‚Äôs about all I could do. 
---
 I use Combat Knives exclusively now. My X0-1 and my Combat Knives are just OP. Repair to 200% as the faster the weapon, the more that adds to the damage.
---
oh i havent used my gatling since. Its unreal
---
And you know these players used their real world money and not just accumulated points, how exactly?
---
I just made an expanded radio station in spotify and play that as I'm playing if I feel like the radio is getting stale.  Works out pretty good, also let me have a fallout christmas playlist around the holidays. 
---
Is it any good? I found a crossbow my level but just stashed it. 
---
&gt; Isn't there an age restriction 
---
It's M but there's no accounting for absentee parenting.
---
Because there's a shit ton of Skyrim in this games melee builds and in the actual game engine itself.
---
Have you ever actually played Skyrim...?
---
You lose caps based on your level: lvl 50 lose 50 caps
---
 X0-1 and my Nocturnal Combat Knife, at night of course.
---
 Melts Ghoul hordes so well I get in trouble. ;)
---
This is amazing to see! You looking to expand in New directions or find ways to utilize this new power? 
---
It really is the best way to play. I didn't care about doing anything in particular until level 50. Once I started trying to do specific things/do quests/farm - THAT'S when the game got annoying/boring.
---
We could have a Hawaiian bar camp theme , id love that !!
---
Don't expect to get one every time you kill a non-queen SB.  I get a Prime Receiver plan once for every 10 SBs.  Get one every time with the Queen, tho.
---
Ammo: has weight
---
Guns: do less damage compared to melee
---
Guns: need 'rare' mats to repair (springs and screws)
---
Ammo reduces ammount it can be used ontop of condition issues
---
Laser Weapons: have rare ammo, but do around the same damage of normal guns, but were being used to replace balistic weapons by the US military for no perceivable benefit based on this
---
Player base meta turns to melee primarily: Bethesda surprised at this
---
&lt;insert deathclaw with pickachu meme face here&gt;
---
I watched a friend play with a grognak axe melee build, their gameplay gave me Skyrim nostalgia right down to the swing animation.
---
...and since it's furious, make sure to stab a LOT. 
---
Stealth boys, chameleon armor, etc. Lots of ways to get back into stealth after pvp starts.
---
Hb even when their dead for easier looting 
---
Sugar grove and the Satcom site right next to it. I got all of mine from there.
---
If you worry about dying, lure the herd from the laundry and parking lot to the entrance, then pop them from up on the balcony. Being careful not to pop a robot, that is. Just tag as many as you csn and wait for the big boys to come bat cleanup.
---
 Stabby stabby ... anyone can join our club. ;)
---
I am on PC, so no message option.
---
I would recommend building North of Flatwoods along the road from Valut 76.  You would see more people if you built at Whitesprings, but that comes with the constant threat of a nuclear bomb destroying your camp.
---
Same thing happened to me when I sold my explosive Gatling by accident. Basically when you sell it they give you 1/4 of the market price but when you buy it back you pay 2x, this is with bargain perk enabled. A good price to pay to learn to pay attention to what I sell. 
---
I like all those too, New Orleans could have some Jazz music :)
---
Yellowstone = Behemoth Legendary Yao Guai territory !! 
---
Will keep this in mind at the cranberry bog next time I watch a nuke from atop the watoga station.  I'm playing the game as it is but I guess that's 'exploitative' and my fault and not the product creator's.
---
also your revolver breaks at about the same rate as my fist.
---
in theory your armor should take less of a beating, but I don't know if that's the case.
---
I think it's a neat theory. If Bethesda goes with this, though, then they should be careful of not tying too many of the unrealistic world features to the idea of it being a simulation. Without fast travel, respawning, unrealistic carrying capacity, etc. the game would be a whole lot less playable. I don't think they want to back themselves into a corner by having an "Awakening Day" DLC that removes fundamental game features. Better to just continue to suspend disbelief about some things.
---
It would be nice to revisit the Pit !!
---
I just had a TSE black powder pistol drop for me at WS Monday morning. And an explosive sub machine gun at Watoga, same day.
---
Looks good, maybe get rid of aquagirl, ninja and deduct one point from adrenaline/makeshift warrior so you can get bloody mess
---
lmao exactly what I was thinking while reading this 
---
Kevduit is f‚Äôn funny.
---
This x1000
---
Also in PvP it absolutely GARBAGE. Super sledge/death claw gauntlet/power first/Fire axe can 1-2 shot most players, even in PA. 
---
The Shishkebab (with the same rolls) will need 5-6 attacks at least, even more if they‚Äôre in PA. 
---
Most threads that goes "im having fun i dont get the haters" are people that played the very little content this game has. Played under 20-40 hours.
---
 Excellent a building contractor. We need RP in this game not legendary farming, although that is fun. ;)
---
And we get early days of the Minutemen led by Prestons great great Grandad and the first Quest is to save a Settlement ? Hehe :)
---
good luck i server hopped for 3 months straight for that outfit and ended up buying it for caps (but got it for free anyways) on xbox. 
---
Yes. and Graham has it too.
---
 Richard Wright: You can't have everything ... where would you put it? 
---
I might try again and force myself to VATS with my rifle build, maybe I'll get into it.
---
But this game was not designed to be done solo. They made it able to be solo to not alienate their fan base that is used to a solo game. (Partial sarcasm). 
---
I‚Äôd sell it. A little quicker
---
I wouldnt mind finding somone who wants to unload a megaton of fuel. Might be able to use my AAE huge flamer for once.
---
I use a plasma thrower and lever action rifle.
---
Ghouls heal like legendaries from my plasma thrower.
---
A vertibot was taking literally chip damage from my lever action, one third of the bar drops then jumps up to like 1/20th of their health instead.
---
Legendaries become literally almost invincible if you don't take your sweet precise time killing them slowly.
---
Can angrily confirm they reintroduce as many bugs as they patch every, single, time now.
---
Pay your workers better and get off their asses about deadlines and shit.
---
Take your fooking time to fix yer fooking product, we will ALL be happier in the long run for it.
---
you mean you didn't start this way?
---
The rare clothing bot. Not one of the ones at the train station. 
---
Honestly, some people just don't want help with god tier weapons for their level.  Maybe fear has nothing to do with it is all I am saying. I like fallout for the (minor degree of) difficulty and doing things myself.  The main people complaining about NERFs/BUFFs on weapons are the same people complaining that there isn't an "endgame".  I don't think this game or any fallout game was meant to be beaten as fast as possible.  You are better off just dropping it in a box/selling instead of trying to fulfill a "pay it forward" gesture in person.  
---
Many good points. As for the end game, I made a new toon to play a completely different way, and focused on what I wanted to play instead of min/max of capabilities.  
---
I‚Äôve built at whitespring and at the overseers camp for high traffic areas. Out of those two options, I would recommend whitespring. I‚Äôve found the super low level players that run up on the overseers camp area don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôre looking at when you show them more complicated building plans. They just see it, say cool, then wander off exploring. But at whitespring you‚Äôll get tons of visitors that have played for a while. They seem to appreciate cool looking builds more. But it‚Äôs all personal preference and coincidences. Good luck! 
---
If forced to guess, I'd say the [Mr Fuzzy mask was pretty rare](https://youtu.be/SUhLZz7_MU8), given the effort it takes to get it. 
---
What are you even going on about ? My opinion does not have to correlate with any intended feature. Its my opinion, I can have one about anything.  Just like your statement does not correlate with my initial reply but you put it here anyways right ?  As for the PVP aspect of the game .. Pretty sure there is a passive mode for a reason? .. So are you telling me that PVP is the Main purpose of this game ? If so please explain to me why they are implementing a survival mode ? Furthermore .. if it was the intended implementation (PVP) .. Why would that say this " While the game was expected to launch with public servers only, game director [Todd Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Howard_(video_game_designer)) revealed plans for private servers to be introduced some time after the game's launch. **These private servers allow players to invite friends to play in order to prevent undesirable aspects of** [**player versus player**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player) **gameplay such as** [**griefing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer) **from affecting an individual player's experience of the game**"  
---
So it was not exactly Intended for every individual. They were aware and knew that some of their player base would not be interested in the PVP aspect. Hence "**These private servers allow players to invite friends to play in order to prevent undesirable aspects of** [**player versus player**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player) **gameplay such as** [**griefing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer) **from affecting an individual player's experience of the game**"  
---
So Again, I bought the right game , And I wanna play it how I wanna play it. Without some knuckle head who's idea of fun supersedes my idea of fun by killing me,  camping me, or walking up to my base and blowing it away while his friends are next to them who then proceed to just kill him for the cap reward so no one else can.  yeah, yeah , switch servers, yeah, yeah .. wrong game ... blah blah blah .. why don't you answer my question instead of trying to tell me to quit playing the game
---
When does someones Tip #2 get to supersede my Tip #2 and vice versa? 
---
If they moved the perks that would be manageable, provided Bethesda gave everyone a full re-spec.
---
I‚Äôm deep into a heavy gun strength build with 3 endurance so to move everything in the current system over would take forever.
---
Also for P I assume maybe he means grenadier or fire in the hole if you like grenades? Beyond that heavy guns don‚Äôt demand any special perception perks. Awareness or concentrated fire are luxuries but not required.
---
Honestly there is a way to make this not so bad in game, but locks 3 points of your luck at all times for it.  Good with Salt helps, but honestly food items in general expire WAY to fast, and why does everything need BOILED WATER, and can't be made using purified water
---
The biggest reason melee is a problem in this game isn't the damage, its the efficiency. A melee character never has to farm for ammo, ever. Whenever I make any action in the game, I'm always just thinking about how many bullets that's going to cost. Often times I find myself skipping killing stuff, especially scorchbeasts, because it's just not worth the amount of bullets I'd be spending.
---
The best route to take is usually to Fast travel to the golf club, kill those ghouls, go out the back door, take a right, follow the path to the row of houses, kill those ghouls (especially in the two larger houses, and don't forget the ones on the golf course behind the first larger house), then cut over to the parking lot/fire station and kill those ghouls. After this, you can scrap your junk in the fire station and go kill the ghouls in the row of houses on the left (only a few, I usually don't bother, though some are occasionally legendary) and any animals that spawn in the middle of the grounds. I consider that a full clear. If you need a damage boost, chems are your friend :) Psychobuff is what I use for melee when I want to guarantee one shot everything.
---
The youngest I've come across in FO76 is a 10 year old. Honestly I don't have the patience for anyone under 20 for the most part, I'm old and just want to play the game in peace damnit. 
---
I'm not saying kids shouldn't be "allowed" to play the game, that's between them and their parents. But they won't be playing the game with me.
---
Of course, if you did the frying pan quest CORRECTLY it was amazing. At least, from what I remember...
---
Maybe the head waiter took lessons from the guy in Hells Kitchen?
---
Ok, so its not just me.  I wasn't aware of the setting the table part, either.
---
Since it carries a halloween party premise, thought it might drop an amusing costume or related on completion.
---
I want to agree but only to a point. The loottables feel lackluster at the moment and I can't really move up to GM 2 just yet with my storm as I get killed fairly easily on GM1 when I get to close to the action. The drops for the last 4 strongholds has been poor, 1MW/stronghold session which mainly feels like a waste of time. 
---
I just don't have enough MW's to create a build with sufficient dmg to my javelin. 
---
Game's pretty though, I'll give it that xD
---
Oh god. Just stop. Why don‚Äôt they just buff everything. Give everyone a stick and that‚Äôs it. Stop crying and get good. 
---
Yeah I did my initial build on the driving range as it is the easiest flat open spot, but as you said it is threatened by nukes regularly.
---
Additionally I've noticed 3 star legendaries sometimes mutate more than once but at most thrice and very very rarely is it thrice.
---
This bug is not about the legendary mutated health restoration, it's about a gun like a 3 star vats critical +50% dmg and +33% vats accuracy and 100% vats accuracy outside of combat lever action rifle hitting an enemy while in stealth for 30% of their health only to see their health bar junk up to 90% full health instead of staying at 70, and that's without using a crit.
---
With a crit their health goes from 20% back to 60%.
---
Broken damage mechanics, broken pvp, if this game weren't in the fallout universe I wouldn't be playing it most likely.
---
nuke orange! never thought of that
---
Need help with this as well on xbox.
---
Really wish cross platform would just happen
---
76 is rated M iirc since it has, yanno, drug use, murder, and nekkid potention ontop of gratuetice(spelling I know, it's my weak point, but you need some number crunchin' I can help) amounts of bloody/gory violence, and political undertones/racism (not to mention a quest in the game that shows you why there are not any non feral ghouls points to strait up acts of genocide after the bombs fell)
---
I need practice for couple times but this route looks like the fastest way which is awesome for full clear. I also use pyschobuff. Thank you! 
---
Make some. I've got a fun crew now just from teaming up with randoms. Friend the ones you get along with and ignore the ones you don't.
---
It's just so easy to make ammo with the excavator and super duper though, I can't imagine that many people buying ammo for much money
---
Negative karma. How other users interact with them is up to the players.
---
Yeah I've done a number of unique camp builds including a concert venue and a brick row home.  I try to keep my themes going.  As we get ready for vending machines next month I thought a business was a good build.  I've reached lvl 120 so at this point just farming legendaries is fun, but not for hours and hours.
---
A broken hazmat suit still gives you radiation protection. It does not automatically unequip itself when broken. It just prevents you from reequipping it.
---
Man, without chameleon I just have to go behind an enemy in the middle of the battle and I still get multipliers. Oh oh you don't see me! 
---
Assaultron's are really consistent with this for me.
---
Should be about 20 hours since your last interaction.. 
---
Somehow I always attack the robots and this makes everything harder. I have marsupial and speed demon which makes it easy to run. 
---
Shiskebab was bad in NVFo3
---
This. I used to try to do nice things for low levels assuming they're noobs until I teamed up with one (level 4) and she immediately built a massive shop near the Overseers Camp. But hey, got some discount mutations off her so that was cool.
---
At this point the game has been out long enough that people can pretty much figure out how to farm resources and weapons if they bother to look for the info, most don't need/want stuff just handed to them. I stick to giving stuff to teammates, or randos if they get on mic and ask for something.
---
It's a bit elitist to automatically assume noobs want your gear.
---
Nuka Grape also works best as a replacement for Radaway even at early levels with Rank 2 Cola Nut. Just server hop to buy out all the Nuka Grape and you're set. Also doesn't suppress or remove any mutations.
---

1320 first hit then?

Damn you guys. Had that Bob Dylan song stuck in my head all day. This dude abides

BRUHHHH the RNG gods have blessed u

I might have to see if there is a spot that visible from Whitespring proper but not within the nuke zone.  I do agree in my experience you don't always see high levels running by the overseers camp.  Mostly the drop in at the vault and bounce right away again.  I did attempt to see just close you can build to the doors of Vault 76 and it was not at all close and would not be visible from the spawn there.
---
going the opposite direction (parking lot, big houses, golf club, other houses) works quite well, too, as long as nobody fast travels to the golf club while you're making your way there.
---
It‚Äôs 20hrs since you last traded with that vendor or that vendor‚Äôs faction. 
---
Here is a handy link, that outlines which vendors align with what faction, so you don‚Äôt hit the same faction twice üòä

Anthem is just fallout 76 dlc after all
---
Okay, that's what I thought.
---
Now, I don't think it's reasonable to just *make* this type of change all willy nilly.  Like you, many people have deep investments into certain builds already.
---
Ideally, Bethesda should roll up a ton of changes like this, and make it a big respec event; all special points and perk cards refunded.  But that's a long way off, if it ever happens.
---
Great Pros and Cons as far as cheating Karma goes make it so you can only give or take 1 Karma point per day per player so nobody can rack up Karma with there friends also griefers would lose Karma faster then they could farm it from friends. I play with pacifist mode on so I don't accidentally injure another player. We all know what good behavior and bad behavior is in Fallout.
---
Stealing is bad
---
Breaking and entering bad
---
Griefing Bad
---
Turrets at White Spring club house bad
---
Helping out good
---
Showing a noob the ropes good
---
Saving someone from a mob good
---
Giving items or selling good
---
I know it would be hard to implement with all the variables but it would also be nice to spot those Vault Dwellers with the low moral compass.
---
I hate hate hate the spoiling mechanic.
---
I've got mine just past the Overseer's Camp.
---
Mostly low level players pass by, or drop in;
---
Higher levels seem to just use the Overseers Camp (even though there's no Tinker Table).

If I had the caps I‚Äôd hire u in a hot second

I think it‚Äôs around 1 est? 12 est? It‚Äôs not 24 hours from last vendor because I was keeping track for a while and it definitely wasn‚Äôt happening that way. 
---
This is /fo76 lol
---
I have a sniper built like this  
---
The damage even from a two-shot gauss pales compared to melee damage still (TS not TSE) even with crits.  I take 4-5 shots minimum to kill a SB while melee are 1-2 shotting them.  SBQ takes melee more than that obviously.  I have a two-shot "The Dragon" which can come closer, but only for one shot.  After the first shot you're guaranteed to be spotted and lose all your sneak bonus damage since it's not silenced.  Which actually brings me back to the Gauss build.  You're praying the entire time you don't get spotted, but the game is kinda fudged up in that regard and I seem to get spotted from a mile away most of the time after just a couple of shots, or the game glitches and doesn't apply the sneak/crit damage.  
---
As for "Melee risk getting in close!"  argument it doesn't fly well with me.  To make a high-damage sniper/rifle build you dump so much into Per, AGI &amp; Luck that you have nothing left over for STR &amp; END.  I'm constantly encumbered just from carrying around two decent weapons (Primary and backup), ammo &amp; health.  My health is so low that I can be two-shotted by many legendary creatures.  Further, since stimpaks are a percentage of your health, they restore a LOT more HP to melee with high END than they do to me.  This means melee even though they get hit more, can take more hits after a single stim than I can  
---
So yeah, in theory snipers should be a glass canon, but in reality they're all glass, no canon, whereas melee are nuke wielding mega bunker super tanks.
---
Costs too much money unfortunately
---
I‚Äôd second Whitesprings as everyone goes there every day. Just stay away from the back of the golf course! And if rebuilding is an issue with the nuke zones you could either server hop when the countdown begins or build further south - I find that the area where the snake is on the map is just below the typical red radius.
---
I‚Äôd love to see your place when it‚Äôs settled in!
---
can i be your hired gun?
---
Looking at the front door of the golf club, there‚Äôs a ledge to the left.not the far left, but still attached to the golf club building. Hop up there, go to the windows, shoot ghouls. Just be careful, if you get to close, you will be thwocked, and sometimes they glitch out of the windows. Mow all ghouls down, enter to loot.
---
Maybe I should set up the siren to draw folks in lol.  It gets very annoying to listen to though...
---
Thank you!
---
I'd like to exit the simulator that the high ranking official warned us about and emerge into the world prewar just before the nukes dropped, then have the nukes drop and that be the real Fallout 76 with all the dead npc's and stories from this simulation coming to life and happening from the enclave's release of the scorchbeasts to the raiders overtaking the savage divide to the brotherhood and responders trying to maintain a semblance of order.
---
Made the mixed meat stew once. Wasn't worth saving all the ingredients, sort of like the other non cranberry juice xp recipes. The super stim pack recipe takes too much raw violet too imo. I think they've nerfed the scorchbeast liver drops too (to make the charred liver)?
---
I have Blocker 3\* always, on my 1h &amp; 2h build and unarmed but Travelling Pharmacy? I really had no idea that came with any passive boost, just thought is was a weight quality of life type perk, that is really interesting. I could squeeze this in by dropping Barbarian I think, I'll loose that strength boost though.
---
Decisions decisions.
---
The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain.  
---
Requires marsupial mutation, but from the parking lot I jump on the awning, go over the roof and jump down to the back awning. From there you can kill everything on the top floor because you've got a clear shot to everything but a couple of small rooms that no ghouls spawn in. 
---
Then comes the hairy part - you can't jump from that awning back up to the roof, so you have to run around the south side of the building, duck in the front door and down the steps to lure out any basement ghouls, then get your happy ass back outside and hop up onto the bus's roof. Not the hood - if you do, they can still reach you and will hammer at the bus until it explodes.
---
Repeat step 2 until no more ghouls follow you out, at which point you can go harvest your legendary drops from the meat piles. It takes a while (first step is \~5-10 minutes, second is \~30) so the corpses turn into meat piles before you're finished.
---
Go kill you some bots in Watoga if you need a hammer.
---
This is a really cool premise for a business, and I wish someone existed who would do this on PC. There are a number of annoying Grahm plans I need hunted but haven't been able to map hop enough to find whenever he spawns.
---
Source?
---
man, sorry 'bout that, edited my comment... What I read could be applied to Anthem as well and I've had a loooong day at work... xD
---
Thanks for the pointer :)
---
I disagree. Needing to invest 15 levels worth of perks to have each level of Adrenaline, for example is ridiculous. 
---
This makes me actually want to play Fallout 76. 
---
We walk in love but fly in chains

And the planes in Spain fall mainly in the rain.

Even if it did like, 50 damage modded to use fusion cells it'd at least be passable, but noooooo

Thanks, I managed to get the BoS mods on the trading subreddit before Bethesda did that. Looks like they will return at some point?
---
And bobby pins
---
Then make it unequip? I feel this is a pretty simple and elegant solution to what is pretty clearly a massive inequity between PA and non-PA users.
---
This would be awesome too.
---
The elder scrolls series never caught my attention. I tried Skyrim and ESO but lost interest too quickly. So yes, I have played them. 
---
Whats AAE stand for?
---
I don't bulk items to reduce weight, I do it to simplify inventory management. I routinely bulk up everything but plastic and sell the excess. Bulked items end up at the top of the inventory list to it is much easier to see what I have. 
---
That or 12 year olds that got bored of Fortnite, was my thought.

The only real mods that could be applied to a crossbow in 76 and be realistic would be: 1) Ammo based mods, similar to what the Harpoon Gun does.  2) A change to tension which if decreased would increase reload speed, at the cost of range/damage, or if increased would decrease reload speed, but up range/damage.  3) Slight modifications to the stock to increase stability while aiming.
---
And as far as ammo mods could go, they could add: 1) Explosive Bolts, which would deal greatly increased damage, but have 0 chance to be recovered.  2) Serrated which could deal Bleeding, have slightly increased damage and be recovered at a lower rate than normal.  3) Hollow Point which would deal increased damage with a reduced chance to be recovered(same as Serrated).
---
Having the ammo mods act like the Harpoon Gun where the ammo stays the same, but is modified by the gun would be the easiest to do; although, I guess they could allow you to craft the moddified bolts simillarly to how you can craft Ultracite rounds, in that they are crafted from regular bolts.
---
It almost feels like a joke they're playing on the player. Which, I mean it's great when that's pulled off well (like the DMV quest, I laughed my ass off at how accurate that was to real life DMV endeavors), but when you take something traditionally awesome, and nerf it to uselessness...
---
14-15 Per pretty much is needed already just to load up on the perks to make rifles viable
---
"Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it."

They had to have expected people to share the codes online. Hence the weekly reset, so that at least 1 person would need to do some work each week before sharing it. What they might not have anticipated (but they should have) was that fans have high Intelligence stats and that a resource like NukaCrypt would streamline the solve process so efficiently, especially as far as the keywords are concerned.
---
I did have a camp right about at that location but worried that it was a bit secluded as it isn't on a walking route to anywhere (unless you really love that miner statue I guess).  I rarely saw anyone that wasn't on my team or that hadn't settled my camps spot.  It is also true that I could simply do the server hop to save it as well.  My main problem at having it on the driving range (where it sits currently) is that I've seen both my camp and a number of other camps at that spot get griefed pretty hard.  So there is some give and take with the high foot traffic thing.
---
If you‚Äôre lower level when you spawn at the golf course go to the left of the building where the flowers are. Jump on that ledge move forward to the windows. Use whatever weapon you use to kill them. Even if you get one shot on them that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs required. I was using a 10mm just one shot them for the xp. By yourself you can throw grenades in the window too. The more noise you make the better.

I FOUND ONE YEEEEEY 
---
I like that idea.  Here's the updated build.  Any suggestions on armor?  Vanguard Sentinel Good?  I see a lot of people using unyielding but I think that would mean I have to swap some other perks out for Nerd Rage.  
---
It appears to me that whenever they do an update the specs go back to original. Can someone verify this.
---
Two updates ago i even lost my gunpowder pistol.

Keycards weigh 1.

More like art imitating life.
---
Head down toward the lower right part of the map, if you can, and you'll find a few starred locations with ground-to-air launchers. Repair those and go to the nearest fisure and a SB will come out. Head back to the launchers and they will greatly help you kill it, just make sure to land at least one shot on it before it dies.
---
I know someone who knows one of the devs
---
1. Doubt it, they said there would be but I highly distrust them.
---
2. No.  Only thing is server disconnects are extremely more rare because dupers are banned but the dupe exploits apparently aren't fixed yet so you'll still occasionally get a server crash.
---
3.  Starting out, no not really, once you're established though, yes.
---
I wouldn't spend more than $20 on this game, it isn't with a penny more.
---
It just works
---
[Radshield](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/RadShield) gives you 300 rad resistance for 15 minutes. Some good heavy leather for damage/energy weapon resistance any if you're sneaky, you might last until the medicine wears out.

Don't forget to check SAM Condon regularly.  SB's damage it quickly.

Hey man, you can go up to almost any water source and select "collect" instead of "drink" twice to get 2 dirty water, then use it with a cooking station and 1 wood to get "Boiled Water", so although it's silly that purified can't also be used (and I wish it could) that's not so bad. I used to not know this, and would snatch up and carry around every boiled water I found. What a heavy waste of inventory! Now I just use the stream and wood pile by my camp for limitless boiled water. :)
---
I knew where to get the mirelurk eggs, but what's this about ghost item duping???
---
And I'm going to have to frustrate myself testing thistle tea now...damnit.
---
at least it was 3* lolol i think i got may 2 3* weeapons but i have a few 3* armors dropped
---
I think it would be nice to change it so you can't scrap, sell or drop items you have equipped or favorited (barring stackable items). 
---
Yeah, that would be pretty cool the same way that you can check your inventory for Diablo 3 on Battle.Net
---
yeah, i got them all on my xbox char. before the patch, but still missing arms and chest (BoS) on the pc char.
---
A nice player mode'd them for me, but would be nice to have the plans :/
---
Except there are several other points in the game where you *can* choose speech options indicating you remembered your pre-war life.
---
No one "owns" a nuke zone. If someone thinks they do "own" it, then they have no understanding of the game. I'm  99% sure that he, like most others did not search high and low for all the codes within 7 days (or less) so he relied on others (probably that one site)  to get him the information required to launch. 
---
Somebody threw away a TS assaultron head with faster reload, my new character really needed one because I'm waiting for the robot dlc (only speculation at this point) so that will be my main weapon. 
---
Hoping they fix energy weapons.
---
Read your whole posts, agree with most of it.
---
FYI I believe you can only acquire a single mutation per session.  So sit on your Toxic Barrel and get a mutation, then logout to Main Menu and repeat.

Interesting. So far no lock jaw? Thr paralysis one? Makes sense I guess, that could create an unfair advantage in pvp

The arsonist was denied a bank loan.

Same reason you need gunsmith to change out a mag to one that holds more ammo.  (you own the mod)

Well good luck, I'd suggest going around watoga to fibd some easy decent legendaries!

Not so far but I've only scrapped maybe 25.
---
He implores...HE IMPLORES!
---
What ammo are you using? Try having different guns that use different ammo. You will get to a point where ammo won't be a problem when you start crafting it.
---
I have a friend who is very in to figuring this out for weapons, he plays both on PC &amp; Xbox, and Data Mines the PC files, creates spreadsheets and all sorts of stuff to calculate damage &amp; DPS, the basics are as follows;
---
For an Unarmed Weapon
---
* Base Damage = 100 (just for reference)
---
* Instigating x2 = 200
---
* Iron Fist +20% = 240
---
* Ninja x3 = 720
---
* Bloody Mess +15% = 828
---
I think there was something else affecting it as well but can't remember what it is right now, also can't remember what the base damage is on the DC Gauntlet with it's 3rd Claw Mod, but I think it's 150, which would make it 1242 (1st hit), &amp; 621 (subsequent hits) based on the calculation above, though it seems to hit much harder on subsequent hits than that, also the instigating effect seems to work on anything over about 80% health, even though it says "Full Health".
---
I have a video I will try to load up here when I have time, of me killing a level 65 SB in 4 hits, with the 1st hit taking it down roughly 50%, and the 4th hit needed for the last 3% +/-.
---
When did having to turn off and on a game just to continue to play it as intended become not a game breaking issue?  It literally forces you to shut off the game just to continue playing it as intended again.  Immersion breaking, progress breaking, the social menu won't even properly let you join friends sometimes.
---
Game breaking at least partially, shouldn't have to have a friend close down their game and load it back up just so they appear online properly on my social menu...
---
No big deal, but it's "parity" FYI. A parody is what the devs are trying to turn FO76 into.
---
Add mouth harp  + harmonica pls
---
I think you used to be able to get crits outside of vats with overdrive, but that was a bug that was fixed. Forcing a crit is pretty powerful and happens more frequently if your just keep building your crit meter and expending it. The amount of crits you get with crit savvy+bank is ridiculous. Add better criticals to that and it's pretty OP. With auto weapons it's even more powerful since every shot after a crit is activated (on a single trigger pull) continues to do crit level damage with crit accuracy. 
---
I get your points, but there's really no way around it. VATS and crits are superior for DPS **and** they can change the tide of a fight in PvP. There's even a post about DPS that proves this point pretty well. Fallout isn't a traditional FPS, so it's missing the point to try to balance it like most FPS games. So to the original point, buffing ranged so it would make DPS/DAM better on ranged weapons would imbalance the game. 
---
????????????????????????????????????
---
Hazmat suit and rooftops.
---
Probably anything you get from events, if I had to guess. 
---
Ah, I know him well.  That raider is still looking for his misplaced missile launcher after 16 years of being dead.
---
That's determined. 
---
You maybe right, I am not 100% on that. I have only started collecting the trapper armor. But it does come with high rad resist and can also have the prefix for and additional +25 RR. So it's kinda broken in some ways. I guess. lol 
---
If memory serves, there's actually an unlisted radiation resistance on Power Armor and Hazmat Suits.
---
Doesn't matter what your rad resist number shows on the stats page, being in normal armor (non-PA, non-Hazmat) will not protect you in a nuke zone.
---
I'll see if I can dig up the video going over it... of course, that was a while ago, things may have changed.
---
You get the all rise after completing mayor for the day
---
Well said good sir well said. 
---
Nothing about FO76 has any balance to it. Most weapons are garbage without loading up and maxing out the related perk cards which constantly have to be shuffled around with each weapon change.
---
Hazmat and a berserker handmade with a hardened receiver... For whitespring anyway, it's a walk in the park especially with marsupial mutation. 
---
Fissure sites I use a hazmat and a twoshot explosive rifle, lever or handmade. 
---
I couldn't get on with VATS in fallout 3 or 4 or NV, I do use it sometimes to get the attention of SBs but my weapons have short range so it's probably not doing anything anyway.
---
It's the PC keyboard I don't find it natural or comfortable to keypress into VATS it's just me I know, my loss.
---
ha
---
I just had the same Problem :
---
\-Turret vanished. Like totaly gone, only the cable that was connecting to it was hanging in the air
---
\-Budget is still at max
---
\-Repair-all-Option is greyed out
---
\-Several Restarts, relogs, serverchanges et all didnt help
---
Make guns do more damage, add higher level enemies to the game.
---
As long as you're not sociopathic like my parent is, you're cool in my books despite leaving a 5 year old to fend for themselves in a post nuclear war apocalyptic wasteland :P
---
get twisted muscles and the "strange in numbers" perk and if u want to stay in a world for a while and ur solo, invite random people to ur team and one if them has to have a mutation, this perk is very good!
---
Instigating in stealth, so good. I used to like instigating medium speed weps but can't go back.
---
BTW, there are diminishing returns on strength. After 15 STR, it's only 2.5% per additional point of strength. After 30, it's only 1.25%. Further, adrenaline stacks are far easier to get with ranged weapons since you don't have to tank hits or run to enemies. To add to it, I don't think concentrated fire works for melee, which is basically an OP version of the furious legendary effect.
---
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
For ammo, use weapons that use .308 or .38, they are plentiful enemies that drop them; keep one weapon for each type.   
---
Use the Scrounger perk and search each ammo containers you find.  
---
Use a melee weapon as much as possible early on; you will save a lot of ammo; especially if you are fighting a lower level enemy.  
---
Find the plan for the Tinker's  workbench (or find a public one) to craft ammo.  
---
Collect as much steel, lead and gunpowder to craft ammunition at the tinker's crafting station.
---
Sure! What he said!
---
Game is too easy as it is . . . Just need to fix the grinding costs associated for ranged with repairs and ammo.  As a sniper / stealth build I am constantly having to farm lead / steel / aluminium which is just not something melee has to do.
---
Rifle firing .308? 150 damage.
---
LMG firing .308? 13 damage.
---
Math checks out.
---
One of my chars, is auto rifles + sneak.  95% of the time everything works correctly.  Then this will happen, I dont mind getting spotted out, and needing 10 rounds to kill super mut.  But hitting from sneak, then they heal back and auto detect me and every shot seems to do 50 less damage then the last.  I had a leg 50+ take 5 mags because of the healing bs.  
---
Ooooooor they can just play the game for fun and forget all the identity politics for a brief moment. Just saying.
---
It was limited time, but ole of my friends found an image for a black .44 with gold accents and a golden ‚ÄúGarrahan‚Äù or however you spell it on the side. I‚Äôm thinking that it‚Äôll be released along with the excavator skins. 
---
No, this is a stupid idea. Nobody will wear anything else ever if a hazmat suit becomes a cosmetic item with a stat boost. This would remove one of the only reliable counters to Sentinel legendary armor users. Damage immunity and radiation immunity? What are you thinking?
---
üòëüòë you're joking me right lol. I haven't been in a zone to test it yet, hopefully it's changed since then. Thanks for the input and if you can find it please post the video. Would be crazy if it's negated when in a nuke zone, so basically it would be like protection from radiation damage from gouls or gamma guns etc not environmental like a nuke zone 
---
Use one of the 500 rolls of duct tape, no more splinters.
---
You obviously dont listen to enough reviews or youtubers.. this is not a "train wreck" it's a "dumpster fire". Huh, some people! /S
---
We're you able to learn the plan bh scrapping them? And if so, would you be kind enough to make me 2? I'd pay caps (:
---
It may be easier, but god its boring... 
---
Wow, defensive much?
---
Wow.  This would actually be really awesome on RP servers, if they ever add private servers.
---
Just north of Watoga with a large, illuminated two story building. I've never had my C.A.M.P. attacked.
---
Well, I mean the reall issue is that unlike in FO4, non energy weapons that deal energy damage don't deal buffed energy damage by having their associated damage perks equipped.  So for example, in FO4, the Shishkebab's energy and ballistic damage was effected by Big Leagues.  In 76, Gladiator only increases the ballistic part of the damage.
---
Also unlike FO4, there isn't a perk that buffs energy weapons specifically.
---
Good Luck w/ that. They're a reliable drop w/SBQ but a rare drop w/regular Sierra Bravos. Honestly you're better off checking the blue suitcase in the Watoga train station about 10-15 minutes after the queen fight (presuming a satisfactory conclusion ofc). Lotsa folks drop their duped/known ultracite/prime plans and junk (good junk!) after the SBQ fight at Watoga. Generally in the blue suitcase but you should check all the containers. In fact I know one dude who just drops all his duped plans and unsalable junk n ammo rather symbolically in the trash can out front. Best to check all the things. 
---
I don't think it is necessary to re-explain what is already clearly written, but you are having a bit of a struggle so here goes. If it breaks easily, which it does, and un-equips when broken, it wouldn't make sense to wear unless needed. Problem (and it is absolutely a problem) solved.
---
I watch Twitch streams of people playing Fornite etc and watching these guy's keyboard cams explains why I'm such a dolt with gaming. There is no way with my old creaky fingers could fly over the keys so fast, so I stay with WASD and a space for jump sometime shift for running but always end up hitting Caps Lock or control.
---
Getting old is  a pain, literally.
---
That‚Äôs the first thing I posted about. It‚Äôs about the amount of damage. 
---
interesting, haven't seen any of the recent datamines
---
It was; based off how many clues you had it scaled up to be the only weapon with 4 augment slots. 
---
But there was no denying it was a let down that instead of some badass weapon, it was a frying pan. At least to a 12 year old me.

I may be misunderstanding, but You can tag wanted components. I‚Äôm giving PSR instructions, not sure of XB1 or PC, but maybe someone else does so bear with me. Wait until you pick something up with that component, then in your pipboy, scroll to ‚Äújunk‚Äù. Press R1 for component view, and X on the component you need. It then tags it for search.

Just add another radio station like hunter/hunted that forms a team once 4 people are listening to it.
---
Call it Jolly Cooperation.

Nothing is out yet. So wherever you got that idea, it's just wishful thinking and speculation.

no.

Adding higher level enemies is effectively a nerf to all weapons. So, sure.

By any change; do you need an accountant? :P
---
Use a mic, it is a game changer when trying to gift stuff to people.

That reminds me, we need more emotes to work with.  At least a sorry emote and a gifting emote.

And also, love your name ‚ù§

Hahaha seems legit
---
Agree on all points, I really hate scorched and their running and hiding, it looks so daft to.
---
I‚Äôd say something like increased prices. Like bots charges more. Stuff like that.

Jes√∫s, what an embarrassing error on my part. Lmao. Thank you for putting me in my place. üòÅ

What vender is it?

Thanks for your thoughts Karen, so when the kids hear 4 other players talking about sex and other mature content don't get mad at the other players.

Sounds like a good in game business?

Captainnoob on YouTube refers to all diseases as Ghoulaids.

Follow what this guy said...I just started playing a couple weeks ago and more or less went about the way he is describing and have not had ammo issues.
---
I thought it was just trying to be nice.
---
I guess trying to be nice is elitist now, wtf.
---
The joke is that ms stands for milliseconds, not minutes

I'm a new player to the game (yes people are still buying the game) and was shocked at how weak my 10mm pistol was even after buffs. Overall I was going on a pistol wielder/sniper build but after seeing how much better my machete was, I started putting points into STR.  Doing a lot better now against scorched as a result but its sad the game pushes you into a play style that may not be what you want.  Though, conversely I can stand there and get shot at for ever by them too...

Because it's ripe for abuse. Even hosting them for people to sort through opens them up to all sorts of copyright claims because people will inevitably upload songs they don't own the rights to.

Bullshit - we‚Äôre all huge bullet sponges, even out of PA and at 18% health.
---
My mega sloth always respawns, it sucks since half the time I actually want it dead (because it mindlessly attacks my team mates).
---
I did a similar test myself last year, around Christmas time.  
---
Wanted a non-PA build for nuke zones, but no matter how much I stacked rad resist (pro-tip, you can/could stack normal rad-X, diluted Rad-X and Rad Shield)  I was still taking well over a dozen rads per second. 
---
I did some digging and found a video where someone else did the same thing and got the same results.  Can't seem to find that video now though, sadly.  
---
Still, it will be worth it to test.  It might have been a bug back then, and it might have been fixed.
---
I just tested this last night with my auto handmade. The first bullet pull is the crit shot. Everything after was reg dmg
---
I don‚Äôt believe you can learn any mods from scrapping chainsaws. I know some mods do not have plans you can learn. Could be wrong. It has happened once. Killed the guy that was right just so he couldn‚Äôt spread news that I was wrong. üòÇ
---
You may not believe me but i know the truth
---
It's desperately needed, but licensing the songs is expensive. They can't just reuse songs from prior games, as they were only licenced for that specific game. Using them in FO76 would require relicensing them.
---
I leaned Bow Bar and have heard from another user that they do drop, albeit SUPER rare
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. I have done several nuke runs. I have 11 extra nuclear key cards. I would love to participate! I will bring my super sledge, AND my 3 explosive shotguns! 
---
Early game hunting, pipe and pump shotguns are a dime a dozen and if your scrapping consistently you should have a good amount of mods to make a good gun. 
---
The same goes for leather and metal armour. 
---
My solution was to place my camp with two silt bean plants writhing the build area. They messed up the neatness of my other crops, as I had to build around them so they wouldn‚Äôt disappear, but at least I have regular access to a couple. 
---
Yeah, [here‚Äôs the image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/508031985889968149/548191329620852737/atx_skin_weaponskin_44_gilded_l.png) my friend found. 
---
Or the bugs finally get to you.
---
I went in to this game just wanting to explore and loved it. But the bugs got so bad it was more frustrating than enjoyable so I had to step away. Still waiting to see when they fix them so I can go back
---
What plans are you looking for? I can mod most guns but tbh prime receivers aren't all that worthwhile on most guns. If you want one modded hit me up.
---
Because normally it isn't their fault.
---
But when you're on the junk tab and a weapon or apparel pops up for a split second while the menu moves down to the next junk item, that's NOT the player, that IS the game and it's badly written code which IS the DEVELOPERS RESPONSIBILITY.
---
We shouldn't need to spell this stuff out yet we need to, wtf is up with that, huh?
---
Are you on XB1? I‚Äôm trying to get together a group of cincy area people to team up and wreck shit!!!
---
Nice to know that it's been done before i can use it as a kind of control for this one, fingers crossed it's been changed, kind of sucks that you're restricted to PA or Hazmat for a zone. Thanks. As soon as I've test it I'll post the results.
---
The problem isn‚Äôt server hopping, the problem is running in when someone else is already there. I will rarely hop for Whitespring ghouls but I‚Äôll never go in if someone else is already there, I‚Äôll just either hop again or go do something else. 
---
Looks like Brotherhood under armor and some Scout armor from Enclave.
---
I got a Responders EMT jumpsuit from Project Beanstalk last night.   I'd never seen anything like it before and neither had my running buddies (all 100 and up)
---
Furious blades all the way!
---
There are not millions more tse's just like it, tse's are no longer dropping, they're essentially legacy items now that slowly drop out of existence the more players lose them.  Why is that hard to understand for some people?  It's basically common sense.
---
Thank you for posting this. I agree 100%, as cooking is one of my favorite things to do in game. Hopefully Bethesda will read this and take some action. 
---
I guess I never tested it except for the lead and aluminium. I only bulk to sell because of that. I just went off the weight it said the items would bulk to. 
---
Watch Oxhorn on YouTube.   He covered this.  Great lore vids.
---
not at all. the esbr is a self regulatory body (made up by video game makers) to allow consumers, specifically parents to make informed decisions based on content in the games they rate.
---
it's not a law or a restriction. it's a rating based on blanket content socially agreed upon that garners a specific rating.  all games under each rating are not the same game.  if you think playing a heavy story driven game like fallout4 where you play purposeful (and mature) content is the exact same as playing fallout 76, I don't know what to tell you but it's just not. but because there are themes that most people deem mature it has been given that rating. yet game play and purpose is not really the same.
---
I know for a fact Minecraft is not rated mature yet some online play is VERY mature and my kids don't play on those servers. parents should pay attention and not just look at the ratings only but take into consideration online play and the communities as well. 
---
the esbr ratings are guides to make an informed decision. I like to take everything on a case by case basis. and make an informed decision.
---
I take my parental responsibility serious and I'm glad no one has the full authority to take that away from me as I'm not endangering my children's lives or mental health because I let them run around exploring a virtual video game world in survival... it's almost identical to playing Minecraft with a different graphical engine for kids.
---
Wouldn't it just be irradiated water though, honestly I would want people shooting that at me.
---
Where did you buy it for caps? 
---
I was just telling a friend of this idea that popped into my mind. But I couldn't work out a viable business strategy. Good on you for executing it successfully!

---
I watched it, but he doesn‚Äôt say what the roots are. With the help of our friend up there we may understand more (by friend up there I mean the first comment)
---
Some of the stories you come across in FO76 are just as mature as those in FO4. I'd let &lt;16 kids play both, but not unsupervised.
---
I play Sirius Sattelite 50s on 5.  Works like a champ.
---
dude it‚Äôs a game, get another gun and start on another build. Jesus Christ, I see a million and one posts about TSEs being sold all the time, what‚Äôre you talking about legacy items for?? Besides once the legendary vendor drops in you‚Äôll be able to roll for another. Stop acting like it‚Äôs life or death dude
---
For me, when I'm closing and reopening, I've been in a server for an age and my connection seems to be getting a tad wonky. I think, in my case, it could be my system resources need to be refreshed and the cache cleared

The submissions would be reviewed by bethesda, not us, then the best ones could be added after verification. There are a ton of automated sites that can tell if a piece of music is copy written.

also, there are a ton of Public domain music out there.

It doesn't even matter it's not like this shit is going to be seen or taken seriously at this point anyways.   
---
Doesn't miss like VATS shots you say?  Did you ever think to aim down the sights instead of relying on VATS and it's capped 95% accuracy?  Heck, depending on the gun, hipfire is more accurate on average than VATS.
---
Or just 1 shot them with a Radium Rifle/Gamma Gun, Bloodied = Almost Dead already, and Unyielding Sentinel Armor doesn't help a bit against Rad Damage.
---
Besides that it surprises the crap out of them when they get killed, which is priceless.
---
Similar setup, even with Nvidia's recommended settings same issue. 
---
x so x fatal x 
---
I do have a couple of AA guns including a 50 cal.  And lvl 2 tank killer.  Hate the Gutsy and their ‚Äúwho wants to get their ass kicked‚Äù banter lol 
---
my appologies, your right
---
if my kids were allowed to get on voice with strangers or area chat at all then I would have to have a discussion right.
---
safe to assume no one has seen any of the adult content that pops up online in minecraft that's VERY present in a "kids" game then if that's the logic being used.
---
Really?  So the mentally ill adapt or die?  No, we don't, we live in a civilization, darwin was a white supremacist who's famous 'the strongest survive' remark was based on whites out living blacks which is utter compete racist bullshit.
---
You don't adapt or die, you live regardless of your situation until you die like all the rest.  The way of the world was prosperity.  Clean water, fertile dirt, a seed falls and a tree grows.  Animal life had an equilibrium of balance.
---
Human's came along and shit all over all of that then had the audacity to blame the world for their own monstrous excuses like 'adapting the environment to our needs' aka cut down all the stuff that gives us breathable air, hunt all the living things, and destroy life and lives so a fraction of the whole can flourish.  Wtf.
---
LoL 
---
Easy to forget identity politics when the only identity being repped is yours, eh?
---
For everyone else it's a reminder.
---
I have 5 characters and back this up. Early game is brilliant.
---
I'm guessing you mean the server disconnects not actually CTD, ya? While there is still the occasional DC, that seems to have chilled out quite a bit with the duper crackdown...at least on PC. 
---
Then it‚Äôs gonna up and stick to everything
---
There was a 40s on 4 at one time. I think it's named something else now 
---
my children under 16 don't play unsupervised. and they don't get on voice. and that's *all* games especially those online as that content can be very adult even in Minecraft. (which is rated for children...)
---
I want to make a base demolition build haha hows this look?
---
I try to do this with plans, purified water, food, and Stimpacks/disease cure/rad-x and away once a week! My and my group hunt the lowest level player we can find, while all wearing the gopher outfit and leaping through the air with marsupial/strange in numbers. So all the poor lower level sees is 4 giant gophers leaping at them and then wanting to trade.
---
Nooo the creator of a product isn't responsible for putting caution signs or warnings on it at all to help avoid Human errors from happening, no not at all.
---
I feel like bloodied got secretly nerfed I remember I used to get 1k dmg without any buffs at 50% took a break and came back to only 500 dmg 
---
With nocturnal I'd be happy if they simply got rid of the negative effect during the day and had it do normal damage.
---
PC?? 
---
Dump all your 1* items unless you use them IMO. Those are a dime a dozen in this game and vary seldom can you trade unless someone is looking for a specific piece of armor. 
---
Invite friends, when in Watoga get a shot on it and let the bots do the rest. Same in whitespring. 
---
Or like above surface to air missiles.
---
I know they fixed their sonic blast but that doesn‚Äôt work so well when 3 show up 
---
The entire armor system needs a rework.  It favors high damage low dps weapons over low damage high dps weapons 100% of the time.  It is complete bullshit.  Armor reduction is way too valuable because high level enemies have tons of it and it reduces way too many guns to pea shooters and melee weapons to pool noodles.  On top of that, energy resistance isn't even affected by armor reduction so if laser weapons weren't bad enough they don't armor reduction to make up for it at least a little bit.
---
I've been using it for fun lately. It's definitely nowhere near as effective as my hunting rifle, but would love if it could be on par with them. Only advantage now is that you get your ammo back 1/2-1/3 of the time.
---
I tried talking to some. Not all, I seldom get replies from people on voice. I assume area voice is muted by default or something.
---
I enjoy the thought put into these effects. You came with a problem and some attempt at a solution. Kudos.
---
Dammit I messed the quote up.
---
Hypocritical statement coming from someone lacking the personal responsibility to actually empathize with another.  Wtf is wrong with you?  I'm mentally ill and still find you more messed up than I am.
---
Ok. At least I know my laptop isn't fucked. Other games run ok anyway. Strange though. This issue wasn't there in the game originally. It started around mid January and has gotten worse over time. Today I could hardly move inside Sugargrove due to the constant stuttering. 
---
So, your post is a great example of the entire problem with identity politics and trying to insert the same into games. Exactly what do you know about me? How do you know which "protected class(es)" I fall in to? And I do fall in to several, just FYI. That's why I LIKE gaming, to get away from bring a label... its liberating,  you should give it a go. 
---
All the best to you
---
I can craft prime ones, so I totally back this up.
---
I know you can sell those items without bulking but it would be so nice if all scrap bulked so we could keep better track of inventory. The names of the items are so strange to me and make keeping track of things far more difficult than they need to be. Waste acid is at the bottom of the list alphabetically. And gold scrap above it , then molded plastic etc.  
---
It's a pain in the ass to scroll the whole lost every time u need to see what you have and its completely out of logical abc order
---
Hey i would like a gun. How do i apply? 
---
Parents have never paid attention to game ratings. The only time they have it's either "no videogames at all" or "gameboy games only" or something like that.
---
My lag feasts are inside WhiteSpring with all the robots and inside the WhiteSpring Enclave bunker, that's so bad I get sea sick, Son's of Danes? that is dreadful also, yet that's an outside cell inside the warehouse it's unplayable.
---
Pretty much everywhere else things are alright, I have grass turn off in my ini so that helps allot. The sliders in settings make no difference really, I have everything on high. MSI GTX 750ti.
---
This! I've got a prime anti-armor crossbow that could use some tinkering. At least some different sights would be nice. I mostly use it if I'm farming ammo mats as it's fairly cost effective.
---
I have started to see this the last few days but since most of the time it was on legendary creatures I considered it normal. But yesterday I paid more attention and it does seem to be back.
---
Could be better - which is why I‚Äôm petitioning here :). 
---
Gotcha cause I was asking for a friend! I'll get back to you  in a few hours, appreciate it!
---
Thank you. The lighting isn't great. 
---
Screw that guy, you're right and he's wrong, if he doesn't want to see that then he can argue with all of us calling his bullshit out.
---
Thanks for joining if you have friends whod want in tell them to hmu
---
It's definitely prohibited on Twitch. Probably bannable by Bethesda as well, since it's considered cheating, but it's silly to think this was a case of stream sniping.
---
But, for anyone thinking about going to their stream and retaliating/harassing them... Yeah, you can get banned from Twitch for that. And Twitch global bans are IP-based, so don't try using an alt account, either.
---
Psn?
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever scrolled through my junk. Just toss it in, and craft away
---
Nice thank you..
---
I agree the fallout franchise is opposite of kid friendly 
---
and guitar sword

Cat lady house / High Schools...
---
server hop a few times and you'll be straight
---
Grass shouldn't be an issue in inside cells. The fires are quite taxing on the graphics though.
---
The burden of proof is on you though. You cant be mad that someone doesn't believe you if you cant offer more than what you have. js. 
---
Hahah.
---
The passive boost he's talking about is the points you need to put into Strength just to get/max those perks.  Also, if he's maxing both of them and has no other perks in Strength, it's a 30% boost(25% if you don't include the first point of strength).
---
It's from my experience based on two things, time and distance.
---
After I feel, I think, 15 minutes or around that, you will produce a new drop paper bag.  As for distance, I've noticed it's about the size of a camp area that combines bags, outside of that distance a new bag forms.
---
Running backwards while shooting works the best for me.
---
If he doesn't want it, I'll take it off your hands, I'm on PC. I won't be on until after work though, around 6pm PST
---
I agree 100%. This game could be an exploration game on it's own. I must have at least 100 hours in the game and I just reached lvl 35. I get so lost in exploring around and looking at stuff I barely do all the quests and farming/killing required to level fast.
---
I like it and think it‚Äôs cool and unique!
---
 Kinda dumb. I just use Orbital Strike but YMMV. ;)
---
Yeah, bizarre...
---
Head along to Morgantown High School. Loads of plastic there! Check the gymnasium and the canteen. Shit loads of plates and plastic pumpkins!
---
Heavy guns and explosives to break in, shotgun to clear out anyone
---
Plastic can be found everywhere, if you loot everything you‚Äôll find it constantly. But yeah, we could use a third major hotspot or even a fourth.  
---
You can run the Watoga High School monster mash event and get Heavy Combat Armor pieces reliably.
---
How many times does "Furious" stack and how good can it get?
---
Not if MODUS kills all of its members again o:
---
Exactly. Cross bows are like the most heavily modifiable weapon on the market today. They seem like they were tailor-made for a game like fallout‚Ä¶
---
Finally someone who knows how to deal with them and play the game, if only more people could adapt and learn how to play would be great. üòî
---
\&gt;Weapon power - cant take out a level 5....
---
Part of the challenge is figuring out which of your weapon is the most effective against which level enemy.
---
At L33, I've found my melee weapons are generally more effective than firearms against most critters, up to a point (sometimes that point its enemy level, sometimes its number of enemies).
---
At which point you fall back, find a perch, and switch to sniper :)
---
also scrap laser rifle from mutants.
---
4 plastic/gun, or 6 if you have scrapper perk
---
I‚Äôve gotten 3 3star shishkebabs but always gotten rid of them since they‚Äôre that bad
---
They said this is their first attempt and admitted that on release the game was about half way to where they really want to bring it to. Its not like they said FO76 is going to work seamless, bug free and have endless activities to partake in. I knew it was going to be a rocky start paying attention to this and am glad they finally have a road map to view. If all that gets implemented well then the game should be great. Could care less about fo5 personally, until they bring about a new updated engine unlike the one they have always been using. Not likely, I know.
---
Yea works until you hit that rock you can't see or back into a wall just as you throw a grenade.  
---
I used bulk screws irl when I had a workshop, otherwise sizes got all muddled up together.
---
Don‚Äôt get me started. If I could run around this game like fucking Lara Croft  in the wasteland, I would be so fucking pumped up.
---
Was gonna say this. I hit up watoga high school and then the top floor at fort defiance (dining tables and pool table). Can get well over 100 plastic from those 2 places. 
---
What do you want for it?
---
I would imagine so.
---
It also is effected by ammo smith rank 2, you'll make 9 instead of 5 fuel.
---
Oh, that‚Äôs clever.
---
I like a lot of them. As long as they don‚Äôt get too op. It would be great to make all of them build specific. I also think mutants would be sweet if it went up by a certain percent for every mutation
---
I think furious and two shot shoudl swap places. And furious get a new effect. 
---
Furious: continued attacks on the same target increase your attacks on that target. So melee get faster and guns shoot a little faster. 
---
Two shot: new name Burst Fire/multi shot: successful attacks  increase the next hit by 1/2 of the first shot up to three hits. 
---
I‚Äôm just spit balling. But I‚Äôm also sleep deprived so not thinking at 100%
---
Everything else sounds good.

---
Yeah, exactly, and then really fun mods like the blades on the ski-sword. There‚Äôs so much they can do here...
---
My mind has just been blown. I finally get it!
---
lol :)
---
Guns have range. Why do so many people forget about that big advantage?
---
Good luck killing that enemy on the roof with your axe, while I just shoot it from the road.
---
Wait wait wait wait wait. You mean to tell me a [huge ass sledgehammer with a rocket attached to it](http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-all-rise-legendary-weapon.jpg) does more damage than [a plain old sword with fire on it](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/5/5d/Shishkebab_%28Fallout_4%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20151114180709)? This changes everything! /s
---
That's great to know!  I always thought it was odd thst they roamed in one small area.
---
Yeah, because how well you can see, should affect your range damage the same way physical strength would actually affect your ability to swing a melee weapon faster and harder.  /s
---
I never understood that either. I have the mod for a receiver or stock or anything, but my feeble brain that can somehow create an extractor that mines ore from the ground can't install it on a gun. Oh well.
---
So...do you just not pick up any junk?  'Cause the only time ammo has become a "problem" is now that I'm at the end of the game using a Gauss rifle, but I can make piles of ammo from the junk and junk weapons I pick up while exploring everything.  I gotta go in there to find any notes/tapes/story/etc, I might as well pick up the random stuff in there.
---
Also fixes the not-enough-caps problem when you bulk the excess junk and sell it.
---
I regularly find a copy of tinker‚Äôs bench plans at the cabin work bench location. South of the military training base. 
---
You can get a lot more than that if you pick up all the enamel buckets. Clear the whole fort and walk out with aroun 200 plastic. Also umbrellas when you first walk in, cooking oil and salt/pepper grinders in kitchen areas, and there are I believe 2 bread boxes in the fort as well
---
I assume the faster melee weapons are best with Furious?
---
I don't think you need Wasteland Whisperer but I'm not sure, you can tame them only if they are an appropriate creature, in a solo random spawn, there's a spot in the top right of the map, east of a fissure sight and north of Freddy's House of Fears and Abbie's Bunker.  3/4 times I've been there it's had tameable creatures, Mirelurk Hunter, Molerat, and Fluffles.
---
Does it still break down every day?
---
Thanks for the advice!  I'll check those places out to get more plastic.  
---
They do sometimes turn back hostile if they get a distance always from you. 
---
Best use I‚Äôve found is stopping random Scorchbeast attacks if you are doing something else and don‚Äôt want to be bothered. 
---
Good question!  I enjoy this part of the business and it's nice to be "wealthy" in the game.  I don't have to go out and farm for supplies anymore for I've secured deals with various dealers to keep me supplied at predetermined rates.  I can hire out help for just about anything that I need including my own security.   I thought about donating some of my caps from time to time to new low level players to help them get started in the game.  I'm excited to see what new vending features are coming from Bethesda with the spirts crafting.  Maybe I'll open up a bar and strip club?  lol
---
Really like this idea.
---
Please know that I misunderstood the title and thought you were saying chems and drinks need conditions to expire.
---
I see that is not what you are saying.
---
I really like the idea of a popup icon with a timer showing certain food, drink, and chem effects somewhere on the HUD and would like it to include info on diseases and addictions.
---
I mean, if you‚Äôre just TRYING to be a jackass and argue realism I can do the same thing. 
---
Technically the ‚Äúplain old sword with fire on it‚Äù would be far more effective of a melee weapon than a ‚Äúhuge ass sledgehammer with a rocket attached to it‚Äù. 
---
You‚Äôd never be able to control or even hold onto the rocket, because the acceleration and force would be too much for any person to control and withstand. 
---
If you somehow could hold on, you‚Äôd tear your arms off or destroy your own joints from the force. 
---
If you somehow had a body that was indestructible and could withstand the starting/stopping of such force, you‚Äôd still knock yourself off your own feet by swinging it and likely would miss your target. 
---
So yeah. Get rekt. 
---
Next. 
---
First of all, your analysis is incorrect for one important reason. You can't compare initial damage of the two weapons because their attack speed is wildly different. One hand weapons attack extremely fast. So what you want to do is compare the DPS. If hammer deals 2300 damage in one hit, and one hit takes 2 seconds, that's great. But if a sword deals 1200 damage, and each hit takes 0.5 seconds, can you tell me which one does more DPS? 4800 DPS on the sword in this example. Additionally, the amount of damage that heavier weapons do is often overkill. It's just as you said. Rules are glass cannons. You're going to one shot them with perks into either 2h or 1h and their respective weapons. 
---
True, that can be annoying, although that's usually not a problem for me.
---
Agreed 100000000000%
---
I play in a team so we swap items often. If I'm asked if I have acid, I have to scroll to the bottom of the list alphabetically, unless I bulk it then uts in proper order. I have to remember to look for molded plastic, not plastic with a p. 
---
Maybe I just have OCD but I hate how it is now. I just want everything bulkable
---
I might!  I will admit there is a fair amount of journal entries I have to make to track inventory, outstanding loans, payments, etc.
---
I just scrapped a few more metal arms and got the polished mod again but it worked this time but u could be right. I'd have to find a metal helmet to see. Thanks
---
Most actual melee builds that you see 1-2 shotting things dump their skills in str,agi and luck, because no way are you gonna 1-2 shot a scorchbeasts it, I literally only have 2 endurance so that can't be true. If it's a true melee build without power armor they're super squishy. Unarmed can't even use power armor so that's just less defense that can be used. With your sneaking just use the escape artist perk, as soon as you get spotted recrouch and you'll be hidden again. A melee build can do pretty good damage to a scorch beast, but only if they've landed. I've seen automatic PIPE PISTOLS take out scorchbeasts in seconds using this exact method with escape artist and stacking sneak damage bonus. This game is honestly so easy and everything is overpowered I really don't see a point in people complaining and asking for things to be nerfed, the game is already barely playable as it is, people are just going to ruin it more lmao. Try to enhance your characters. 
---
Whitespring putting green behind the resort.
---
There are roughly 25-30 golfballs and 4-5 golf clubs.  all of them scrap for plastic.
---
Sadly, this is what I've had to start doing lately.
---
Thanks!  It was a risk, but so far, it's a lot of fun!
---
Well yeah merchants, especially wealthier ones, are the driver in the game. You have full control to shift the game and economy how you please. You pay and demand something, the market follows. I was thinking of sponsoring guilds or other groups, get some empires going. Interested to chat ideas in DM? 
---
I watched the you tube videos etc about the beta and still bought it on day one.  And am still playing 350+ hours later.  
---
I think I made the right decision.
---
Thanks! I hate that we‚Äôre on different platforms. Maybe you can start one on PC?
---
FPS drops are local issues, I remember Skyrim having similar issues. Stuttering / freezes are network / server related. Can have hours without and then lockups of more than ten seconds.
---
I'm still asking myself how players from the US, Europe and China can all play on the same server, while syncing in the clients properly.
---
There's a time and a place for criticism. Someone else's thread where they're sharing emotional moments, is not it. It's basic human decency bro. Go shill for your favorite youtuber in it's own thread if you're so concerned about people reading it.  
---
IMO, there was a missed opportunity for including "the times they are a changing" in the songlist.
---
Mr lawyer.
---
I have read your comment and and respect your decision to maintain a soul draining Job you hate just to support your family.
---
But imagen your account was banned because you held too much guns or ammo because it was given in brown bags
---
Bethesda have ruined their reputation and fallout 76 for me.
---
I wish I still had the love for the game you do
---
But in my hateful words I stand
---
Bethesda can ram their game up their arse and I recon you find a better game to loose yourself in and boycott this piss poor company for their extremely poor decision making!!
---
All the best in the future mate 
---
No love for Northeast Ohioans from the 330 :(
---
I'm on PC anyway....
---
Sure!  We can hookup on one of my Discord channels and chat on there too.
---
I do!
---
Yeah I just noticed VATS first shot miss last night, specifically on shotguns, what the heck.  
---
Morgantown High School, Cat Lady House, Bolton Greens, Whitesprings, Watoga High School, Hemlock Holes, the Prison north of Morgantown(forgot the actual name) and Ohio River Adventures - easily can net you over 600 plastic per server if you know what you're looking for.
---
So my idea is pretty useless unless you catch on quickly yo what you did.
---
Can we get a DJ for the radio?
---
That‚Äôs one of the things I miss. The DJs talking between songs.
---
It can be a Mr Handy for all I care.
---
i posted in the fo76 community group asking for it and someone hit me up and gave it to me in game, i could give you his gamertag is you want
---
I get jacked up on chems and play smashy smashy.
---
Complete the full loop you should be able to get at least 1-3 more legendary item drops.
---
Also please take out all White Spring club house turret camps. I thank you in advance for the service you provided to the community.
---
How do I join?
---
Events are basically crappy loot boxes. Spend caps (on fast travel) for a \*chance\* at getting some XP / Items, but risking that the event might not even be viable or otherwise able to be completed.
---
I bet! Seems you found a good baseline for universally pricing combos of weapons/armor. I kept coming back to the dilemma of not having enough money to lend out because I am buying weapons as well as viable ways to raise capital 
---
5 and 8 yr olds also like to watch and dont seem disturbed, although we did have some talks about issues surrounding games and fantasy media early on.  Ive caught them pretending to be a family of wendigos and they seem to like the "gushing blood guys" (super mutants). 
---
 I dunno. There are explanations of its effects one might find.
---
 An ordinary Serrated Combat Knife repaired to 200% runs about 130 a hit. That's a few a second, and it by its self is perfectly able to destroy a pack of Muties pretty quick. My Nocturnal 40% Speed one repaired to 200% does about 180 at night and does maybe 5 a sec. Melts Ghoul hordes.
---
 Your Knife should start around 130, when Repaired to 200% and will gain power for each hit. How overwhelming that is I'm not sure. Go try it out. ;)
---
 My dream weapon is a Furious 40% Speed Combat Knife and you are part of the way there. ;)
---
We will start our selection at the Mothman museum. we will release a date and person to help soon.
---
I mean, if you're dumping the stuff you don't want on noobs and patting yourself on the back for being "nice" then yeah, kinda.
---
I'd rather see some mechanic to ask for assistance with an event across the server than anything that makes it easier to solo things.  
---
Not sure, maybe 55?
---
&gt;you pick up a quantum and then had another quantum spawn in the exact same location?
---
In my one experience testing this particular bug, this was the case. In basically the exact same spot where I first found the nuka cola quantum that I grabbed, there were two side by side spawned in when I next entered the same room.  However the subsequent test yielded a rad away and caps stash.  I didn't test further.
---
I believe there's something about how you enter that interior as I further noticed ghouls respawned on the ground floor including a crowned lvl 15 one, but leaving through the rooftop and entering at ground level had those ghouls despawn and meat piles from my previous recent kills spawn in instead with the same loot I left on them.
---
I agree! I miss settlements. I‚Äôd love to build more around existing places as well (like the ruins in Charleston) but it‚Äôs mostly not possible. 
---
It certainly feels that way, lower enemies are 3 stab max, generally 2 will do, and although you can definitely   bring down a level 80 Scorchbeast with a Furious Combat blade, there's the initial low damage stabs that you need to get the necessary stacks to really hurt them.
---
Young, old, it doesn't matter anymore. Might as well live life while you have it to live. I don't have any kids though so I haven't had to worry about that yet lol
---
While we‚Äôre making music suggestions, it would be cool if instruments near one another coordinated musically forming jam sessions
---
I think you can do some kind of "glory kill" in PvP if you have cannibal, but don't know if you actually get food from it.
---
Hmm I think I will wait a bit longer to buy anthem. I don't fancy bricking my console.
---
Yes I understand how DPS works. Now lets talk about the matter at hand.
---
The subject is the raw damage vs armor. Not dps. Dps means nothing if youre not piercing armor because the individual attacks are too low. A mr handy buzzblade has higher dps than a harpoon gun. What would you rather use against a super mutant master?
---
Thats the entire point of whats being discussed, the individual damage of each hit isnt enough. I pointed out that ghouls have low er/dr because theyre a bad example to show that the shishkebab can be good, because anything is good against ghouls, since its doing almost 100% damage. Check up on health values. Deathclaws have like 1500, yet they can tank 40 hits from a 100 damage weapon, because they have very high armor. Unless you have a rifle with the aa prefix, the tank killer perk, and an armor piercing magazine, youre never doing full damage, and the lower the base value is, the lower the end result is.
---
Also, time the differences in attack speed. Its less than half a second. Meaning that at the end of the day, the extra swing isnt making up for doing way less damage. A medium speed weapon does not swing twice as fast as a slow speed, yet many of them do less than half as much damage, meaning the higher damage is indeed better than higher dps. This is pretty widely known, and has been the norm in Fallout/Elder Scrolls.
---
All in due time. I guess, but man pay to get anything neat.
---
That was the original intent of the developers, but they ran out of time
---
Pick up every cigarette pack and carton you see.

I think forcing yourself through ridiculous mental gymnastics just to be able to enjoy something says a lot about that something.

I‚Äôve just been selling those things at vendors...
---
Made a post asking to precheck for nuke zones before spawning in. Got voted to hell. 
---
It's important to keep a good ratio of goods for sale (guns) and enough liquid assets (caps) for loans and operating expenses.  I've been careful in my purchases and focused on weapons that I know will sell fairly fast and at a good profit.  But, I also keep an eye out for emerging trends in the game.  I starting buying up Handmades several weeks ago after their value dropped due to the nerf and people started getting rid of them.  Now, they are popular again and I've been selling them for nearly twice what I paid for them originally.  The same thing with heavy weapons.  Beth is looking these over for a possible buff, so I've been buying up what I can at a good price to sell later after the buff.
---
All very smart decisions. 
---
Recently had to clear up some SSD space, so I jumped in and played for an hour or so. In that time it didn't feel like it was worth going back to just yet. Of course I had about 120 hours in it, so there wasn't much new for me to do. Depending on how much of the game you had left to do could change your answer. I'm really looking forward to the stuff on the road map. 
---
Perhaps you're trying to rush things a bit too much? Stay in the forest for the first 20+ levels, gods know there is more than enough to explore in that area alone... Slowly build your equipment and weapons up. From a survival standpoint,  FO76 is way easier than NV or FO3, imho. 
---
No, I'm not trying to tell you how to play or how to have fun, that's entirely up to you, just trying to give a different perspective. Trying  to do too much too soon can and will lead to frustration. Another alternative is to group up, either with some randoms or by linking up on discord or here. Until FO76, I'd never done anything MP... now I do, sometimes, but mostly just solo. It can definatley give you a better fighting chance against the world, especially if just exploring. Take care.
---
I honestly wish they'd make those mics and amps work for our gatherings. c'mon let us have mods if we can't use stuff
---
They recently put out a roadmap you can checkout. Soonest update I believe is the 12th. Also it just been "big fixes" for the game.
---
Better to specialize and max out your cards or max out both and swap them when needed.  Just my humble opinion.
---
Stop by my shop.  Be sure to be able to communicate using the voice chat system in the game.  I only finance those that I can talk to.  You can learn a lot about someone just by the way the speak.
---
I may need more security.  Stop by.
---
I find your "solution" short-sighted and causing more problems than it fixes.
---
I would also like my assortment of various food items to be included in the quick health button on XB1.  When I‚Äôm in a fight, it‚Äôs quite tricky and takes too much time to select a favorite item LET ALONE scroll through my 100 food items for something specific like a chem I want to use. 
---
I don‚Äôt have the answers but using assorted food and drinks for the perks is a fun element and takes way too much prep when the shit hits the fan. 
---
&gt; I normally pre-order
---
You're part of the problem
---
You fat fingered your controller and it's bethesda's fault for not idiot proofing the game?
---
Can confirm that it happens with the gauss rifle a lot, lever action too
---
Relogging helps, but with how stealth is now, my sneaky sniper build is more trouble than it's worth sometimes 
---
An enemy will spot me through a wall, or my X3.50 crit will do slap damage to a level 5
---
Was probably a glitch that'll probably result in a "temporary" banwave until they get it fixed. F.
---
Haha cool
---
Sure, communication is no problem at all. I'll plugin my mic and lets trade someday!
---
I'll add you later today!
---
My Ign: HaroldBob
---
In the 100 day roadmap they said they were going to do something like this
---
Don't use it, one shot will wipe out all your fusion cells, I did a test shot and lost 900, and my gf did one as well despite me warning her about it, and she lost 7,000 cells.
---
If you have no expectations than literally no game will ever disappoint. Most of us don't have the free time to play every game available though.
---
videogames consume a very valuable resource: Free Time. Therefore it's foolish to go into a game with no expectations unless you have more Free Time than you know what to do with. Most people have very limited Free Time therefore they have a interest in making the most of their Free Time by playing those games that they have *an expectation* of performing well and offering an enjoyable experience.
---
I agree. I think they actually sacrificed a lot to make this able to be played single player. It feels more like a single player game that can be done with friends, more then a multiplayer game it should have been. But they had to stick somewhat to their roots to appease their fan base. 
---
I hope that with the new content they will shift more away from single player and head towards needing to work together (the premise of the game is based on rebuilding. Not walking through the wasteland alone)
---
The game has the potential to be a great multiplayer game based around teamwork. But they will never get there if they try to also make it a solo player game. 
---
Batavia in Clermont county here.... I'm on Xbox, and usually play in the morning and early afternoon on weekdays.
---
Oh lawd I can feel my caps leaving me already.
---
I noticed them in other places. 
---
I was so excited yesterday for picking up 3 Star rolling pin. It‚Äôs utter garbage. If they do nerf melee then things will take much longer to kill. 
---
It‚Äôs coming I‚Äôm sure.
---
Me and my friends have all successfully wiped our mutations and reapplied Adrenal and it worked for all 5 of us. 
---
After doing this, when you log out and back in the positive text will disappear again in the effects tab but your damage will be correct because it will be working. 5 out of 5 people I know who tested it got it working. 
---
If your taking a serum and it isn‚Äôt registering the mutation, it could be server lag rather than a bug. I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone else having that problem and I sell serums so its either lag or an extremely rare bug with a weird set of variables to activate it. 
---
Hope all that helps!
---
Agree 100% I even spent the few caps to get the juke box to add that certain hotel feel to my camp lol
---
Too much to read but I‚Äôm sure a lot of bitching and crying lol 
---
Honestly if they wanted us to play together they really should have text chat, and we should be able to build our bases connected to each other or right next to each other. We want to build towns. We want to build defensive walls around our towns. We want to group up but half the people aren't even on area chat, they're on discord, and we can't talk to them without text chat... so many missed opportuniities 
---
I second this. Please, please make it cost an absurd amount of steel. I think the community would agree, we all have absurd amounts of steel. This would be a welcome expense. 
---
I have a 3* bloodied with damage resist on reload, if you need it ask, I‚Äôm on ps4. 
---
I agree, and besides, it changes absolutely nothing to a game experience that more people are included, so there is really no reason to not do it.
---
Radaway, Rad-X, Stimpacks, Fusion Cores, dropping of junk accumulated within the silo, grabbing different weapons, etc 
---
All STR cards increase STR and thus damage.
---
Last time I saw him, Bastard hit me over the head with a sledge. Fuck that mothman!

I'm pretty sure there are dozens of sites that have it up in a matter of minutes. 
---
My issue is with the sweet labrador tea needed to make the company tea( the most spectacular beverage).
---
Labrador tea requires honeycomb,which is not honey. It cannot be found anywhere and it's only a rare drop from honeybeasts,which are damn rare by themselves.
---
Always keep a melee weapon or two on hand, also use a gun that uses common ammo, like 308 or 38.  If you're on PS4 I'll craft some stuff for you if you want, and I have just over 9,000 .38 rounds, I don't use them I just use them to drop as test bags, or to give to lower level players.
---
Hey, you still need wood to cook. 
---
I've said it before: if they can give us a quest where we build excavator armor and in exchange they give us plans for the power armor station, they can give us a quest to build a lathe (and it's OK if the parts are expensive and wear out over time) and as a reward get the plans for a spring winder.
---
This game is realistic to a degree. I think you're just taking it a little bit too far. No reason to be such a child because someone doesn't agree with you. 
---
Thank you!  I think it is fabulous one can create their own character and function in the game like one would in the real world.  The other day several of my friends stopped by my shop and we were all sitting around the place in chairs just talking when it dawned on me how much this was like we are in reality... just sitting around and chewing the fat.
---
Is that a serious question? 
---
It also misses the point. VATs often misses the first shot period ... 95% or a critical. 
---
They must have had evil in their hearts and feared you were the to deliver justice. 
---
200 caps only goes so far when you grind glowing blobs for an hour.
---
As mentioned in my post, and if you look at the link, I'm looking for the code pieces from previous weeks that I'm missing - the code pieces carried by the officers - not the launch codes.
---
Yes, I'm aware that multiple sites put up the launch codes shortly after the weekly reset. I'm guessing that most of them copy from NukaCrypt. (I joined the NukaCrypt team that solved this week's launch codes.)
---
Go ahead, I'm on PS4
---
Yeah it's a shame that the hardcore gamer folks have been criminally under-represented in gaming in the last few decades. More and more games cater to players who enjoy playing their games for short periods of time and often moving onto the next game after a very small amount of time spent in any given game.
---
It makes sense, I get it. Making games more "snackable" able to be picked up with a very low learning curve, low difficulty so that player progress doesn't stall, and having content that is short and modular so that even a 10 minute gaming session can feel meaningful will make the game more accessible to a wider audience. Which translates directly to more sales.
---
But these are not the only people who play games. While they may be a minority, the  "hardcore" folk still exist, still buy games, and deserve to have fun as well.
---
That sucks a lot, I hate when you find the perfect spot for your base and then can't set it up. I used to have a really cool base by Poseidon on the side of a hill but my base kept getting removed because other people had bases there and when I tried to set it up again, I couldn't put my base back up the way it was.
---
There is no new content or anything any time since launch. A couple bugs got fixed but mostly not. 
---
Yeah, it's silly to watch.
---
Also, their loud tap dance routine whenever you fight them in a wooden building is about as daft.
---
If not months.
---
Hey. Better then emptying all your guns and being stuck with a pipe pistol. Trust me, it isn't fun.
---
Level 100 and didn‚Äôt even know there was a prison or an hemlock holes. But at the same time I‚Äôve only been grinding what I know and need and I‚Äôve been fine

If I want join can I kill all nine believers? Or must I convert them

The gatling plasma gets through about 1 or 2 cores before it breaks. If you use it for the queen though the lag is so bad, you can equip it again and use it the entire fight.

---
Hide on a roof taking pot shots.

My pc is way too squishy to survive being hit by multiple bloated glowing whatevers

We want to show people that we are friendly. convert them if you can and if they refuse then kill them
---
Please come up with something original. Until then, goodbye. 
---
Now, maybe these kids are young enough that they don‚Äôt really identify with any of this and it‚Äôs just another sandbox to play around in. However, as someone that remembers the final days of the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall, I‚Äôve found this game to be incredibly bleak. 
---
It is borderline depressing to wander around Appalachia‚Äôs empty countryside. Listening to the responder tapes and knowing that despite plucky determination they all died a horrible death is a real downer. It‚Äôs like watching The Day After and then pretending to live through it. 
---
Every lead you follow always ends the same, nothing of civilization survived. Even the Overseer who left the vault a few short hours before you is a merely a record of what was. 
---
All this being said, I wouldn‚Äôt allow a 5 year old to play. I‚Äôd say 12-13 is probably a more appropriate age.
---
Interesting. I get where you're going. Only one problem with your train of thought on armor penetration is that there is a cap on it. It doesn't matter if you have armor piercing gun with armor piercing perks and magazine. There is a hidden cap on it. in my own opinion though, it really does not make sense that such a tiny flaccid Little weapon like the shishkebab would even compared to a super Sledge. It has far more momentum. Hitting a deathclaw with a freaking sledgehammer the size of your upper body should do more damage than a teeny little butter knife 
---
Saw him today in the exact same place :)
---
I had a fairly crash free experience until I got fairly established in the game. Nothing crazy just level 30ish. From then until 50 I couldn't play for 10 minutes without a crash. Completely killed any motivation to do anything in the game cause as soon as I felt immersed it would crash. it was like getting yanked out of a warm bath to a freezing cold room over and over. 
---
So for the mixed meat stew.... easily doable. In watoga you can find two scorch beast nests on top of community center... then on top of the municipal center you can get 4 or maybe 5. Each are random meat drops for scorch beasts... may have to kill one or two depending on meat rng... but when we farmed queens we were using super duper to get us all stews that we were even giving them away to high levels that were following us 
---
I have seen fewer nukes the last couple of weeks and the SBQ seems to die less often when nuked. I wonder if there is some link there. If she got buffed and now people don't bother to summon her as often since she is harder.
---
If they nerf things it will bring things down and sadly someone will math out the next big thing and we start the process all over again. 
---
Melee needs to be taken down a peg. Somehow.  It‚Äôs not ok that it does that much damage. I get it that it needs of compete with ranged. But right there‚Äôs no contest. 
---
Explosive effects need to be worked so that it doesn‚Äôt stack with anything. 
---
Laser pistols and rifle just need a small damage increase to be on par with ballistic weapons. And some mods to increase durability. (Although I don‚Äôt see a huge problem with the durability)
---
Things will be ok. 
---
I would have to agree that if a child is going to play any game that allows online interaction that the parent should be supervising.  Of course, each parent knows their child the best and can make their own judgment call on that.  
---
My 8 year old daughter loves watching me play (she actually just loves the music!) and occasionally will take over the controls.  When she is around or playing, I turn off the chat functions so she can't overhear someone using language that is inappropriate for her.
---
I tried to run a crossbow but what killed it for me was how I lost the ability to aim whenever I was invisible/stealthed whatever you call it, from a stealthboy or the armor that turns you invisible when stationary.
---
I can look past the low dps as long as it's fun to use, but the inability to aim negates the fun for me.
---
I seem to recall someone suggesting that it's related to one of the Events - possibly Lode Baring?  But it also fits the theme of the Ash Heap, which sits atop a burning, crumbling mine.
---
I thought that before scrapping something, the scrapper perk reveals in gold find what extra junk item you will get, am I wrong?
---
From my experience, when I'm not in a group, the game seems to try to avoid picking a server where I'll spawn into a nuke zone. I'm much more likely to spawn into the orange haze if I'm joining friends. I'd guess it's like the CAMP placement logic; helpful but not perfect. 
---
The bugs were annoying, but I was still content to ignore them for a while longer. The game literally just stopped letting me play it for any meaningful amount of time. 
---
&gt;  if BGS hadn't been so ambitious with making this multiplayer then I'm sure it would have been a fine game.
---
Or just not rushed it out.
---
Or...get screws when we scrap. A multi-tiered scraper perk would be awesome!
---
I got it on ps4, but may get it for pc since they are practically giving the game away now. 
---
This is a problem goign back to FO4. It was weirdly weak there as well when it should have been one of the best melee weapons.
---
I think having things be harder to kill is a good thing. I forces the player to adapt. If everything takes one hit to die games too easy. And it should be. This is a survival-like game after all. 
---
Or at least a perk that gives you a modest chance to get rarer things, like springs or screws, from scrapping things. I'm sure there's more to guns than steel and wood.
---
That would be awesome. I remember playing a game called Guild Wars where you are allowed one Legendary Spell and it was always a strong spell that had synergy with other spells. So I thought it would work well in FO76 as well
---
Source? I know they did the development, but how do you know they entire office is still 100% of the time on this effort?
---
I agree, and would add making servers more Permanent, so bases don‚Äôt disappear upon leaving the server making towns viable. There were so many things they did that prevents this from being a proper multiplayer game. Yes you can team up, but it feels like it was designed to be played solo. (Spawn numbers are based on number of players and such) 
---
As far as no one using chat in game, I am guilty of mainly rolling through the wasteland in party chat with my peeps. Because I have so many issues with the  in game chat system. Not to mention if I am in party chat I can control the party volume and the game volume on my turtle beach headset  separately via the volume scrollers on the unit. With in game chat I have to mess with all the sound setting to make sure I can hear but not drown out my teammates voices.

We are still in the early stages and I hope Bethesda works on making the game better in the long term. It is a great concept and has potential, but a lot of things were either not thought out or glanced over in production. 
---
I am in it for the long haul, and have had a lot of fun playing.  
---
U don‚Äôt need to kill sbs for recommendations go to the golf club and farm legendaries 10 will do
---
Thanks, good source for legendary armor in general I guess?
---
Are you on xbox by chance? Aaaaaaaand do you have a TSE or 2shot lever action?
---
OK that makes it clear, something I just hadn't internalized, cheers :)
---
A scope or proper sight would be a welcome addition.  The iron sights are godawful.
---
If anything give us a chance with the scrapper perk to gain screws when scrapping weapons and armour. Doesn‚Äôt need to be a really high chance. Just something to ease pain of knowing you used your last screw
---
I do agree with You however reviews help me sometimes to choose if I want to spend that much money on a game (we have to admit they are not cheap this days). But to be honest watching gameplay on youtube its better way to decide if this game is something one would enjoy or not.
---
Springs I don't mind too much, since there's clipboards everywhere.
---
I also don't mind having to go farm materials like wood, plastic and similar.
---
It just really bothers me to have to farm something as easy-to-machine as a screw when I can do far more complex machining to turn several cooking pots into an automatic rifle.....as long as I have picked up random screws.
---
I'm sure the BoS plans will be back in a future patch. I only had to hop a couple of times and got the plans from Watgoa station. Thanks again, I wanted the plans so I could use combat armor without the need to farm ballistic fiber for repairs. Now I can just craft new level 40 armor whenever it breaks.
---
Laser rifle could cook em too 
---
I've been playing since the BETA. This game has made me so mad with all the problems I experienced ... you have no idea. Constant disconnects, glitches, bugs, griefing, you name it. I've seen it all. I've thrown things at the wall I got so mad lol. UGH this game has given me such a headache so many times.
---
But one night I was in my weird ass camp (I go around finding unusual places to build) lit by campfire and playing guitar and it dawned on me that I'm in love with this game despite everything. It's amazing. It's a real treasure. I can't wait to see where it goes in the future. I'm glad I stuck with it. It's freaking fascinating and fun and as it stabilizes, I have more and more fun interacting with people. The sky's the limit. 
---
I finally found the plans I was looking for, it just took a lot more server hopping than expected. 
---
Thompson has good mods.  10mm has a horrific peep sight and no suppressor.  It's basically hipfire only.
---
Also turn off the radio and just listen to the soundtrack, a completely different experience.
---
Haha, that's cool. Thinking outside the box...er...beast.
---
I had a bug yesterday, on PC, where the screen went black when I fast traveled to Harper's Ferry. Only thing visible was my power armor UI. I could still pull up the map and fast traveling away didn't fix it. Logging all the way out, closing out of the game and opening it up again fixed it and I didn't have any other problems.
---
That is the only explanation that makes sense.
---
One of my points is that even if u get low health... Unyielding will kick in and you become even more unkillable then before. 
---
After seeing what Venderbot Phoenix does even to his own kind, being gouged is the least of our worries.
---
I think it is. I quit for a while because I thought it was broken but there‚Äôs so many builds now that are all viable in my eyes
---
In the words of odd future: kill people, burn shit, fuck school.
---
2nd one today??  Please nerf strollers, Beth!
---
The main issue is ignorance and perception. We expect that our playstyle or character build should be viable no matter the circumstance, even if our build is utter trash and we choose to ignore certain mechanics.
---
People using guns ignore the massive damage boost they can get from stacking sneak attacks, head shots, and critical hits because, "VATS feels like cheating". Absolutely ridiculous. You said you don't want to debate about DPS/Damage but we need some better way to measure how effective each build is. We only look at the damage number and ignore a ton of other factors.
---
Also, the only reason TSE was nerfed was because of the duping community. Those weapons are meant to be ultra rare. But players abused exploits to flood the game with one of the best weapon combinations. If they were ultra rare like intended, they would not be an issue. But when every mother trucker and their cousin are running around with the same damn gun, you have to take drastic measures to correct that shit.
---
People claim laser pistols and rifle break too fast but I used mine all day yesterday and only repaired it twice. 
---
The plasma Gatling and laser break at slightly faster rate but granted they shoot way faster. 
---
The crossbow is good it‚Äôs more of a sneak weapon and not really a end game weapon but not everything needs to be. 
---
If I remember right the gatling plasma had a bug that made it pretty much unusable. I never had one myself though so not positive on the details or if they ever fixed it. 
---
25 steel = 5 screws....sounds reasonable?
---
these are all crap weapons that no one uses
---
My alt is my fun pistol wielding drunk. A little like Doc Holliday only a female instead. I drink beer and whiskey instead of water on that build :)
---
What sucks about the stew is that it removes other food buffs so it‚Äôs weird 
---
hmm I think I get that, thanks for the info
---
I tried sure but it gets frustrating when enemies regenerate health or you lose yours randomly or enemies do enormous damage for no reason and they instantly respawn
---
I‚Äôm in bethel!! Give me you GT and I‚Äôll add you when I get home. If I‚Äôm not working Im playing  mid morning/afternoon and when I‚Äôm working I‚Äôm on from 7-9 or 10! My GT is domafett513 it‚Äôs my sons account but I‚Äôm the only one who plays fallout so I just share his instead of paying for more accounts! I‚Äôm stoked on this bro!!
---
/u/ladydevann any thoughts?
---
I checked last night with herd mentality and class freak. Class freak did not appear to effect the penalties to my special stats when looking at my stats in special tab of the pipboy.
---
Exactly man, feel like this is the perfect description for this game! 
---
513!
---
I'm ok with this, GT is the same as ID
---
True no indoor grass, the fire barrels and indoor bonfires are hard on my system too.
---
Here's my rifle secrets.

---
I run all 5 pieces chameleon. It stacks. MOBS will push you out of the way looking for you. Never, never ever use an explosive weapon. Everything within earshot will pinpoint you. You'll almost never leave caution status.
---
1\* instigating Lever, suppressed.
---
171 native damage.
---
2.5 X damage Every.Single.Shot.  427.5 damage , 855 damage the first shot.
---
Crits, not sure of the multiplying factor there, but they hit regularly.
---
Run deep pockets on all my gear, have 280 or 285 carry weight total.
---
As long as they start with full health, I can 1 shot any level 68 super mutant in the game, except 3 star legendaries, and sometimes crowns take a second shot.
---
3 shots to kill level 91 death claws, unless they are legendary and regenerate, then it's 5. About the same on gulpers. I've not tried a mirelurk queen in a long while, I had a bad first run in when I was leveling, lol. I don't know how many for sure it would have taken to whip my ass, but I know what they used.
---
A mirelurk king is about 3 shots.
---
There's not a scorched or ghoul that can survive the first shot.
---
If you do get seen and go to danger, you just break line of site and crouch again and you're back to caution.
---
I've killed 3 scorch beasts by myself and maybe used 2 stimpacks because of that dam mist they put down.
---
I absolutely love playing this build, it's just not conductive to group play.
---
Go ahead and make it 50 per 5 screws, if you'd like.  Again, I don't care if I'm doing something as stupid as starting with a 5lb block of steel to make a 1oz screw.  Just let me make that screw so I can actually make a set of power armor without days of searching for fans and toy trucks.
---
So few and you can probably jump there. 
---
Yep, I know about that from the beta. I'm waiting for the energy weapon fix so hopefully they fix the head.
---
I have a 3* crossbow I would part with 
---
Huh, sorry I'm not up on all the hip vernacular that kids use these days...is a train wreck worse than a dumpster fire, or vice versa?  I guess I should know the lingo before I try to understand these things...
---
...also, get off my lawn!...
---
Maybe have a rad storm spawn over the plant that lingers for an extended amount of time. Maybe 1 or 2 full day/night cycles in game. Long enough to incentivize fixing the plant, but not too long to make it unplayable for those without protective gear.
---
Where do you even find a clown suit? Now maybe this is on me for not paying attention when I got that quest(where do you even get that quest?) for not searching the immediate area for a suit.
---
But I have no idea where to find one, nor have I ever encountered one in the wild nor on vendors.
---
There NEEDS to be a way to communicate with others on the server. I mean c'mon, on PC we have nothing outside of 1) area chat and 2) small or neon letters in our camp.  We need a bulletin board, or text chat, or something. Mailboxes...anything. 
---
I don't farm for anything but screws. I take every laser rifle I find, and pick up every plastic tray/fork/spoon I find. Are you flagging mats you need in the pipboy?
---
I have so much plastic that I have to bulk my plastic...
---
How is melee getting nerfed going to make the game better for anyone? I'm seriously asking because if ranged weapons aren't getting an associated buff, then there's no change to ranged weapons on the PvE side or the PvP side. They probably just need to buff ranged weapons and I think I outlined something that'd make them less cumbersome to play.
---
Agreed, Access to just view SPECIAL, Quests, Weapons, Armor, specifically anything else -&gt; icing! :)
---
I thought they added text chat on pc? 
---
Sadly, no
---
Picked up empath last night as I farmed all the mutations. Played around this morning and wow, it sucks. Kept dying like crazy and my teammate was getting tired of reviving me. It definitely is not effected by class freak. Tonight I am going to start on the process of trying to remove it and only it.
---
No, sorry, PC.
---
I don't, because I keep making .50 Cal, 5mm, 40mm grenads rounds, missiles, and mini nukes.
---
Ok thank you I remember seeing the crossbow on pre launch stuff and was like oh they must of removed it as I never saw it in game
---
Not my experience at all. My first character uses an auto handmade as well. Are you keeping the trigger held or letting off of it?
---
I did some testing for an article I posted here two days ago about criticals and auto pistols. I took some screenshots to show how much life enemies lost from one solo shot of a sneak attack, a critical, and a sneak attack critical. The sneak only and critical only took 25% of enemy health off. Both took 50% off. Two consecutive sneak criticals killed the enemy, 100% HP lost. I would have expected to see 75% HP missing if the second shot was only a sneak attack and not both.
---
Some people have brought this up as being a bug. Are you console or PC? Controller or mouse and keyboard?
---
Alright, so am I gonna have your babies or are you gonna have mine? I agree with you **so hard** right now
---
Lmfao 
---
Name calling helps your case none
---
Ok thanks for the heads up will look it up 
---
This is fabulous. I love the shop and the smarmy owner.
---
Yeah.  I was surprised to get some more interesting drops last night.  I don't remember any specific items, but just that the slot machine was loose.  Wish I was at WS instead of doing a plastics run at Morgantown HS!
---
Automatic crossbow mod FTW
---
I guess that was the case 
---
I guess I need to read the patch notes a little closer. Lol. 
---
If you're high level yes. If you're lower level don't bother. The pvp in this game is bullshit, going to useful places like the munitions factory causes every high level player to swarm you and murder you.
---
Most people on reddit who bitch about kids in games forget they were kids In games.
---
I'm 27.
---
I don't want to know what my taste in games would be like if I never got yo experience GTA 3 (shit even GTA 4   came out before I was 18 I think) conquers bad fur day, perfect dark, mortal kombat, halo,  and many others that were rated m.
---
To the people a little younger than me, imagine not playing any rated m games on 360 or ps3. It's almost shocking how many genre defining games you would have missed.
---
Thanks man, appreciate the recognition. Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe
---
Nice wish I had caps to part with haha new player
---
Yeah sure but I'd rather see a craftable variety of bolts for the crossbow.
---
Make me an offer, trades accepted. I will be logged on tonight GT BLUBLZRedeux
---
I thought there was a mod to make it into a sword ... imnnotnsure though cause recipes dont explain themselves at all.  I really wish they would. Say what you mod, say what you do.
---
Done.
---
What about +100% damage including the extra jets mod?
---
I just ignore YT now. Recently bought Star Wars Battlefront 2 and it was fun. I also bought TD1 and that was lots of fun. I intend buying Anthem as soon as they streamline the loading screens a little more and I can get it at a bargain price.
---
Anyhow all the games mentioned were getting really negative reviews from the YT crowd. I still watch Angry Joe though but at least his name says it all so I am Ok with his rants and anger outbursts even though I almost always go against whatever he recommends. Recent examples are TD1, FO76, SW and Alita Battle Angel. Loved that movie! Angy Joe not so much.
---
I've finally been playing the game after deciding to work towards a sniper build for the survival mode, and I gotta say I have fun up until everything breaks, which is constant. 
---
I was amusing myself with raiding that city with the school and the university, but watching a ghoul tpose and then another clip through the world in five seconds really doesnt bode well. 
---
Doesn't help that the game has fundamental flaws with weapons being locked behind arbitrary numbers to inflate a false sense of progression, and the very short but clear delay between me shooting a ghoul and them falling over. 
---
Toy cars are the best.  1 lead, 1 screw, 1 wood.
---
Glad to be of inspiration!
---
Best night for loot ever. Multiple 3* weapons and armor despite the multiple screen freezes 
---
Right hisb50 cal must be empty
---
Steel is your limiting factor in making 40mm grenades? 
---
Even if it was just the server time it wouldn't be as lame as it is.
---
Damn strait...we gotta live dangerously
---
That's not the kind of thing that would be on the roadmap. That was for new content. I hope your comment was just some weird sarcasm but it didn't seem like it.
---
I don't play this game in front of my 6yo, it's pretty atmospheric and scary for him.
---
Thanks man I'm gonne look in to it!
---
I'm cool with my trusty Vampire's Lead Pipe all day.
---
I never run out of plastic or adhesive
---
It is when I'm making the other types of ammo I mentioned, that and adhesive since I don't have a farm growing, and some nuclear material for mini nukes but I have over 90 of them so I think those are fine for now.
---
If you nerf everything how the hell are we supposed to kill the SBQ? It's hard enough already.
---
How is this a bug?
---
"Anti armor should ignore more of your enemies armor, or stack with incisor. Tests have proved this effect is useless if you use incisor."
---
Is this for real? 
---
I was just making the move to anti-armor as my preferred weapon type since 'two-shot' means an extra projectile that usually misses and by default reduces a weapons accuracy stats. I figured AA Explosive was better but I keep Incisor maxed out for my Deathclaw and Mole Minor gauntlets...
---
You should read more than the title. I argue against nerfing anything. 
---
Lol, shitty design saved by shitty implementation. Love it.
---
Just listen to "Old World Radio - Boston" on YouTube while you play. The dude streams every fallout game's radio stations in one, plus more fitting songs, and original dialogue segments in between, it's amazing.
---
I like this idea, maybe a backpack or something that you can drop and only repair stuff and deploy a sleeping bag fromüëç
---
Never thought about this though! üôå
---
üëè PREACH! üëè
---
I love cooking but some of these items are just not feasible to acquire more than a couple per day and the methods and locations that spawn them are too infrequent! I want to make Black Berry Honey Crisps more and its sad that I can't.
---
I never did stop by and see your shop.  I really ought to do that. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with ranged. People with top tier guns don‚Äôt care until they get nerfed. And those that don‚Äôt have top tier don‚Äôt shine a candle to those that do. 
---
The guy with an AA combat rifle is never going to be neck and neck with the guy with AAE. 
---
They don‚Äôt have to nerf the weapons just tone down some of the perks for them. 
---
I main rifles. I have a quad lever, a tse lever and had an aae lever and my quad does more than both. 
---
I do ferry singles of Technical Data. The SB attack happened on the 5th fast travel there. I should have specified that.
---
It‚Äôs just not as advertised as other things. 
---
Ahhh thanks anyway!
---
Lolz legendary hobby pins!
---
&gt;  Melee doesn't have a perk that staggers or cripples
---
They don't need it, it is built right into melee from the start. Power attacks stagger and can cripple. Meanwhile the ranged builds have to spec into perks to get that same ability the melee builds get just from power attacks.
---
Make the alarm go off when the sun comes up. 
---
The irony when ‚ÄúFloppyGrandmaTitties‚Äù calls you a child for an appropriate response to a sarcastic comment that has no weight behind it.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôm not here to argue with you. I was merely pointing out it was a rather weak argument, though admittedly it was in a verbose way. 
---
I hope you have a great rest of your day and wish you all the best friend!
---
It got to the point where I was fighting sleep not trying to log out of that server! Today at work has been brutal
---
meh, it's free at least, server time would be even more interesting. Would suck to see a 03:00 when your clock is showing 17:00 at home though.
---
I didn't really suggest buffing rifle damage. I don't think it needs it. Ammo crafting yields and weapon condition perks need a buff though.
---
The big drawback to be aware of is VATS annihilates your fusion cores while in PA.  I believe there is a fusion core drain for activating (including activating where nothing happens because no targets) and each action while VATSed.
---
Weapon artisan works better on melee weapons repairs them to better than new condition. For instance i have a 4star bloodied machette that did 170 damage. With weapon atisan equipped it came back to me at nearly 200 damage
---
The energy damage is what destroys the weapon.   You could buff the energy damage by 500%, but unless they institute a similar boost to the physical damage it‚Äôll be useless. 
---
I found mine here. 
---
https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1346
---
If you have marsupial, lure them out of the club and jump up on the awning or bus. Then you can pick off to your hearts content. Until the players show, anyway.
---
It would be nice.  But there‚Äôs so many places to craft and sleep as is. And moving your camp is nearly hassle free as it. 
---
If they add player made factions I can see that being a part of a backpack the group could use but not as a solo player. 
---
Intellectual Property issues aside, this idea has the potential to be awesome. But I can see it going badly pretty quickly. 
---
Evil doers fear the silver shroud. 
---
This has been posted a million times, it's not an original idea at all.
---
I have 11 in Strength, and I use that for the shotgun cards &amp; bandolier.
---
I don't have any rifle perks, I'm not gonna change my build for the crossbow.
---
It's fun to do sneak attacks with on low level enemies at least.
---
Sorry, i should have been more clear. anti armor for melee weapons is useless if used with incisor. incisor helps melee, but AA% caps out, so it doesn't stack with AA melee weapons. if you use AA ranged, it still works as it doesn't stack/cancel out because of incisor.
---
Reverend SMB is my gt. Now if you tell me that your also a musician looking for people to jam with, I'd reconsider my faith in humanity.
---
Ps4. We did this test pvp. Maybe their is a difference?
---
Inside the vault usually posts on Thursdays...
---
You might try around Whitespring Station. It's reasonably high traffic, and tends to be out of the nuke zone.
---
I repair fine i can go all day before needing too. I can average 2-3 a day. And ammo I can make 500. .45 easy with ammosmith and super duper. And that hold me well plus what I can find off bodies and mobs. The gunsmith perk has my back. Bandolier keep my ammo count in check. 
---
Any large amount of damage staggers. That's kind've why fatmans and harpoon guns tend to stagger even without the associated perk. That's why power attacks stagger - because it's a large amount of damage. Further, you don't need to spec into perks to stagger. Crits stagger. However, regular attacks for melee don't stagger as much as other weapon classes. 
---
I agree younger kids should not be playing this game. Unfortunately there will be some who make it into the game and you can only set a good example for them in online etiquette and not scream out obscenities or be toxic to them. 
---
Some kids also come on because this is an escape from their shitty realities. We cant do anything for them except make the game enjoyable.
---
Yeah, exactly, it disrupts the immersion and then there‚Äôs the entire loss of civility/communication that goes with it. 
---
Like the idea of different kinds of servers for different kind of folks. And not just PVE or PVP. 
---
Good idea. I'll go look for someone to kill so I can scrap their bulk.
---
I think i only need 12 for all the shotgun shit then 6 in per for skeet and concentrated fire then i already have 15 in agi gonna trade out evasive for enforcer
---
I‚Äôll agree. It needs to change. I think we need LFG channels, but no automated anything. 
---
Like OMG
---
1.  Is that verified that crit on first auto trigger pull gives crit damage to the whole burst currently?
---
2. No crit banker in this one, probably a balance decision, PVP would be pretty wacky.
---
Like that person said Thursday. 
---
And it‚Äôs easier to fix and do things on a solo player game but when it‚Äôs more everything has to be checked to ensure it was done with good intentions. 
---
That'd be fine if the lever used 45-70 instead of 45. Unfortunately, the combat rifle also uses 45 as well so some consideration should be given to that. Likewise, the decondition on commando builds is a bit much given how luck of the draw procs on trigger pulls, not per hit.
---
I've got a million screws and gears.
---
It's springs that constantly allude me.
---
Don't
---
LEGENDARY GUN WIELDERS (roadmap stuffs) SHOULD GET A SLOW TIME DEBUFF THEY ARE ABLE TO APPLY TO A SINGLE PLAYER EVERY MINUTE (or whatever).
---
CHANGE MY MIND. 
---
I feel if Bethesda does this they could lower the drops of screws to go with it. Not sure how I feel about that possibility.
---
Don't they? They seem to when I go do *One Violent Night* with more than 1 other person.
---
A larger super mutant behemoth with 2 heads
---
And A Beholder eyebot would be cool
---
Don't even think I'd let my five year old play Paw Patrol video games. I want my kids to have a childhood. Now I feel old. *shakes fist* "When I was your age!!!1!1"
---
Is it Motherlode wandering around?
---
There's a camping ground with a lot of notes with complaints about spooky stuff happening. One of the things is earthquakes. Behind the camp is a treehouse with a terminal that let's you control it. Apparently it was all an elaborate prank. I dont remember exactly where this was.
---
The game already has violence, and sax and violence was forbidden in games some time ago.
---
The main thing that has changed is the game is more stable.  A lot of bug fixes, less crashes etc.  
---
Beyond that really nothing new.  No new quests, items, enemies, etc have been added.  
---
If you liked the game but just wished it was more stable, go right ahead.  If you got burned out on lack of endgame content, wait.  Next week a new patch is coming that should be adding at least a bit of new content.
---
Buffed/fixed
---
Wow never knew. Yay the hubbys wrong lol  But can't that get confusing? What's the point of naming a character? 
---
aaah thanks! I feel better now!
---
Had not seen it or stated this is an original idea that nobody thought about.
---
Maybe a "Rambo" legendary with explosive effects... 
---
Burst fire/tap. Back when I was using a handmade and luckodraw tap fire saved me at least 30 or minutes before repairing. 
---
 I get what your saying. But full needs to have some catch to it. If that means breaking often that fine. 
---
I've got two three-star two-shot crossbows that could just be so much better with mods, or a scope so I can actually hit those medium ranged shots or ever hit anything while invisible
---
This is how I usually play. 
---
And turn on spotify and have your fav tunes going. I like listening to reggae while mowing down muties. 
---
I could be wrong, but I think that the super sledge , or maybe it‚Äôs just All Rise, has a shock absorber built in to the handle.  
---
So, you start the swing, activate the rocket just after the apex and the shock absorber kicks in when you hit.   If you miss, however...  yeah, you‚Äôre just along for the ride...
---
FYI, the guys wielding a super sledge in real life would be built like Arnold Swartznegger.
---
Lastly, carrying around a super sledge would also require a ton of fuel.  The fact that fuel isn‚Äôt required for its use is a little puzzling.   
---
That is one hell of a tangent but I will bite. 
---
Yes the mentally ill do in fact adapt or die hence why they have shorter life expectancies. Look at Iceland who abort 99% of all down syndrome babies just because of their mental handicap. We are living in the most prosperous time in human history so for you to say we humans just came and fucked everything up is laughable. Darwin's scientific findings are completely erroneous to his (and many people of his time) philosophy. You do not have to agree with his thought process but you cannot deny the science without dismantling your own argument.  
---
Now back to the game at hand...
---
If you can't adapt to the online version of the franchise that you adore then quit hence adapt or die. 
---
This is either a joke or just some spastic posting.
---
Yeah I figured one server time on all clocks is easier to implement that a whole bunch of clocks all over the server with different times.  But as you said, free clock.
---
&gt;Is that verified that crit on first auto trigger pull gives crit damage to the whole burst currently?
---
I heard the rumor, so I tried it. My health bar mod doesn't work anymore so I can't provide any numbers, but I was noticing equal chunks falling off the health bar with each shot on the same trigger pull in my last SBQ fight. I'd build crits on the queen, then empty a mag of crit shots into a mirelurk queen. Once the show health mod starts working again I can try it out to get some numbers, but I'm kinda worried that they'll nerf it if it gets too much attention. 
---
&gt;No crit banker in this one, probably a balance decision, PVP would be pretty wacky.
---
I don't know what this is in reference to, but PvP is already pretty wacky. You can't easily roll into PvP with the same point distribution that you play PvE in
---
I will do that.  Thank you.
---
Eh, VATS on that and other heavy chain guns aren't very effective. They spend all AP and have that "rev up" thing going on. The reload doesn't occur often with the high capacity either. The furious is the only real good benefit.
---
Copy that.  Thx.
---
I‚Äôm with that. Yeah automates sounds like recipe for disaster for sure 
---
Unfortunately it seems like there's not much point in naming a character aside from your own roleplaying. 
---
This is actually a weird thing that's also in Red Dead Online. You "Name" your character, but people only ever see your account name. 
---
They still haven't fixed that one. 
---
That‚Äôs a good point. I got the game to play with my friend, but then his computer broke. Now I just run solo. Waiting for him
---
I‚Äôll look into it.  I plan on doing more events now that I‚Äôm done with main / side quests.
---
Inside the Vault comes out on Thursdays.
---
They've given us a schedule for all the new things coming in the next few months, plus the Roadmap for 2019.
---
They've given us detailed dev notes.
---
We have a know issues thread.
---
The community managers do all they can, particularly LadyDevann.
---
What more would satisfy you?
---
you might be right if I can get it to slot in somewhere over there.  As I noted the foot print is a challenge almost anywhere
---
Thanks for the offer.  I‚Äôm just looking for something to do.  
---
I like. But hear me out.  5 story tall super behemoth with 4 arms and other supers riding its back. 
---
Is the safe an actual safe?
---
Thanks!!  I wanted my character in pawn shop clothes when he's selling stuff.  He changes into a BOS Engineers outfit when he's working on guns and stuff.
---
Yeah they're trash, I've had two. I dumped the second one as quickly as I would a legendary Walking Cane
---
What does it do?
---
There is zero difference between buying the game the day it comes out and pre-ordering, aside from guaranteeing you actually get it the first day. This hate over pre-ordering is idiotic. If no one buys it right away, then waiting to make an "informed" decision is impossible. It's pretty simple logic.
---
Yeah that was just a dick comment. I haven't seen your suggestion either and think it's a good one. I would really love to have multiple full-on CAMPs to be honest. My current one is maxed out and I want to try new stuff but don't want to tear it down (it took forever to build up the side of a cliff)
---
Unyielding increase all stats by 3. The sudden jump of endurance won't make them unkillable. 
---
At one point, yes, I needed lots of screws and found I ran out... but now I know where to grab the various items of use as I do my runs through areas.  I think I've got close to 400 screws in my stash now.  The one thing I do always run out of is Acid.  Though I must say I did an Enclave Mission in the bog and had about 15 Snally's spawn... so I was swimming in acid...
---
There's always ways to get your needed items up...
---
Screws flag them as something to pick up - Sugar Grove is ok I guess...for screws and springs
---
Steel - pick up every gun/sledge, etc. that you can loot and scrap them.  I do find that the amount of steel dropped from Robots is unrealistically low.
---
Springs... well, Sugar Grove has a bunch, as does Camp Mc.  Clip boards are all over... with a few non-battered ones that'll give you screws too.
---
Acid, I have this flagged for looting... Snally's are a great source of this, so find where they generally spawn and go farm.
---
I do agree that the one thing you should be more likely to get from scrapping is screws...
---
\-G
---
Enforcer is a very handy card, I use it all the time.
---
Most enemies are helpless with their legs crippled.
---
No. I want working pip-Boys with WiFi and Todd Howard as the president of Vault tec giving the inside the vault every week on it. 
---
I jest. Lol would be cool
---
I just want to have a beer in his shop. It looks cool.
---
Two round bursts mean the weapon deconditions twice as fast. Three round bursts means it deconditions three times as fast. And so on. There's some balance lacking there. And that's not even mentioning heavy weapons, which stand to get the largest buff by this change. With rifles you can at least put a weapon bashing stock, but with heavy weapons there aren't many mod options to increase the durability bar.
---
And realistically, high rate of fire weapons are designed to withstand high rates of fire better than semi-autos.
---
Nope to your nope.
---
Even Runescape has selectable world servers that eventually turn into specific servers.  One server was for law rune running, one for pvp, one for role-playing, one for trading, and not just one but several.
---
Give us a server list, we'll fill in the blanks naturally from there.
---
I think hara-kiri would be the only thing that would satisfy some of these people.
---
Yes!  I loved ELEX.  Sure, it was wonky has heck..but that was part of the charm.  
---
Frankly, FO76 is second to none in terms of world building.  Bethesda nailed it on that front.  The environmental storytelling is also really well done.  I don't miss 'human NPCs' at all. 
---
Just like Beyond Good and Evil 2. If you strip out all the things people like from the original, and then forget that it‚Äôs happening you‚Äôll then see that the game will absolutely be a (hopefully) functioning piece of software. Trust...me.
---
I mean, tbf a Pip-Boy app that would make for easy trading and perk swapping when you're not in game would be litty
---
Thanks for the heads up, I'll try VATS in standard armor first, though I have a nice collection of cores at the moment.
---
Why do they even have that "syringer" gun when there is a crossbow?
---
I really like this idea, I had posted a similar idea about players having the facility to build a small (maybe 2x2 foundation block) camp that can be placed closely to each other. 
---
My hope is that in time we may begin to see player trading hubs or small markets if you will, in a pre designated areas. This would really improve player interaction and provide much easier trading.
---
You tell me? 
---
Don't sleep on throwing knives! Easy to craft and they remained effective for me well into the 20s. For anyone reading this who is just starting out, definitely use them. I think the base damage they do is 75, and when you're new most ranged weapons only do a fraction of that. 
---
I too await such a glorious day... that it doesn't break half way through the second cell...

---
If you played fallout 4 on survival mode that's actually how it played. Fights were tense and enemies were downed easily. So were you. It was like everything was playing as a bloodied build. That version of the game wasn't boring.
---
But I don't think anyone was suggesting what you're saying. You're kinda making straw men and then pivoting to the actual arguments being made.
---
I might have to see about finding a spot like that for a guaranteed supply, there‚Äôs too many recipes requiring them, I usually raid flatwoods with green thumb equipped but often someone‚Äôs been there before me lol
---
They surely thought, well your range, it's easier to snipe kill and not getting hit, so lets give them less damage per hit.  Melee, well you can get hit constantly so we need to make the damage a lot more important.  I know I can 1-3 shot any regular mobs.  Scorched Beast maybe 8 good swings, if I do power one, even faster.  It's a shame when you change to Sniper that bleh, damage is not high enough and too slow.  So I prefer melee.  Even my boxing glove spec, I have this 2 shot boxing gloves and some % of AP recovery on it.  My AP fills so fast I feel like a jackhammer hitting everything.  The constant hits just stuns enemies.  It's ridiculous.
---
You know you can get one after completing a mission? It's a unique item.
---
To be fair, making screws (assuming you're talking about something fine enough for making guns) is a bit harder to do than you might think.
---
That being said, *finding* screws should be a hell of a lot easier than finding springs.
---
It's called Thursday
---
Yeah but this will help until the OP is capable of doing that mission. 
---
and ripper!
---
Be what it may. There needs to be a trade off. We can‚Äôt have the perfectly preserved pie and eat it too. 
---
I'll be on later tonight (9 pm central) I can throw down on a SB or two (Heavy gun, Power Armor guy). I'm thegunguyinc on PS4
---
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
---
To me that is where the 'end-game' thing comes in and I think it still requires a lot of work to mature but what I mean by that is if you take The Division 1 as an example. They made the main story consumable by the larger gaming community and you can complete the story and finish the game in 30-40 hours. The main crowd will move on to another game.
---
However if you are like me and the game just clicked for you then they have the 'end-game' content where you can go really deep into the character build and you can try out multiple load outs etc. It really becomes very complicated after a while to match up certain gear with certain weapons to get maximum results.
---
This way they sort-of cater for the wider audience and then also to the hard-core crowd for that specific genre.
---
To me it is something I would like to see expand on by most publishers. If Avalanche did something like an 'end-game' on Mad Max I would probably still be playing that game since I would sink multiple hours into building my car or even multiple cars to take out bigger and bigger bosses to get better and better gear for my car.
---
What I am trying to say as the 'end-game' model matures I think the hard-core gamers will be catered for more and more. Today it mostly caters to the looter / shooter crowd like myself but as it matures it may start catering for the hard-core RPG gamers.
---
On a side note I wish The Witcher 3 had some end-game stuff, I would love to play that game every other day. Maybe repeatable quests to get better Witcher gear to take on bigger monsters. Maybe even a weekly or monthly challenge to take out a massive Monster boss and to do so your character must be equipped properly and you need the correct potions etc.
---
There is one major caveat to this model and that is the funding side. To fund this it would require a monthly subscription model or the micro-transactions you see today since creating those weekly or monthly challenges require people and people need to be paid. On the flip side I would give CD Projeckt Red money if they kept adding new stuff to the Witcher 3 but not all gamers agree with that.
---
I don‚Äôt know about active swapping or moving perk. But being able to do it and make it live when booting up would be cool. 
---
My favorite complicated food to craft is sweet tato stew. It has incredible healing properties and I can make it pretty regularly. 
---
That might be me lol. Yeah, it took me a while, but I found my spot and I have no plans on moving. I wish you the best of luck!
---
Acid you can farm with an extractor. There is a pit east of the observatory, next to the campsite. I had my camp at a lead site behind Lewisberg then moved it so I had acid to break down ores.
---
She would be a named corpse. All the vault dwellers we see that are dead are not named and are not real just placed there to give the elusion of death has consequences. We all no we can die unlimited times without a problem and if we all knew that it would mess with the results of the experiment.
---
I meant four leaf clover. I'll edit it
---
I'll be on later this afternoon and evening here in the states, Central time.
---
This is correct. I camp almost exclusively in the Ash Heap and the earthquakes happen whenever a Lode Baring event kicks off and upon its completion.
---
You mean make Scrapper actually a useful perk like in Fallout 4? Heresy!
---
Sounds interesting, definitely the best proposal.
---
The bonus for PER would have to apply only to ranged attacks though, otherwise unyielding melee builds would also get a buff.  I looked at the different possibilities of % increases per Perception and 1% per 2 Perception seems best.  At 45(46) PER, which is achievable by having 15 PER + 15 from a full Unyielding set + 5 from other Legendary effects + 4(5 with Strange in Numbers) from Eagly Eyes + 3 from Food + 3 from Shielded Raider UA, you could have a 22%(23%) passive Crit chance.  With Overdirve that increases to 47%(48%).
---
Crit Damage is a different story.  A 2% per Perception increase, from 2 PER and up(so no bonus at 1 PER) would cap at 90% more Crit damage with the above Perception increases.  Which I personally feel is resonable, considering the Better Critcals increases damage by 40%, Eagle Eyes increases damage by 25% and a Legendary Effect increases damage by 50%, for a total increase of +205% Critical damage in VATS.  I'm actually unsure if Better Crits and the Legendary Effect apply outside of VATS.
---
This would greatly increase the effectivness of Crit/Stealth Snipers, to the point that the community might start demanding for them to be nerfed(but if they never add a weight reduction perk for Rifles and they never reduce the rate at which they lose durability, it'll be more fair).  Faster lower damage weapons would benefit the most as they'd get a large enough boost to damage that coupled with Anti-Armor they'd be viable end game, though Energy Weapons would still need a damage buff or damage specific perk.
---
Portable fuel tanks, Carlisle typewriters, giddyup buttercup pieces, and antique gloves are on the screws list. Just fyi. And we should have scrapper rank two make "marked to find" items glow. And third rank gives small chance when scrapping appropriate item to give rare mat. Just thought I'd throw that in there. 
---
It would really take off if they had you join the same server every time. But a random server every time you log in means things can change immediately. 
---
I don't really mind having to put it on for nuke zones. Keeps them feeling special. 
---
First a wendigo and now this? I KNEW IT!!! The strollers!!!!!! The strollers are the real end game!!!! Run, Run Away!!!!! They‚Äôll kill us all!!!!
---
Yeah, I have been using an Acid Extractor for the last 20-30 levels.  To me, the most valuable extractor there is do to it being used in so many ways.
---
Obviously they‚Äôve done a good job listing their plans but like... to be fair, i think a functional game would satisfy everyone.
---
Berserker items don't sell too well, so I don't keep them in stock.  I work with other gun dealers and if you tell me what you're looking for, I'll see what I can drum up from one of them.
---
I like it.  Build a tower at the camp, and make the songs mob drops.  So people can tune into your radio station and hear the song choices from the game you like.  Would be fun to do and shouldn‚Äôt bump into IP issues.  Also let you broadcast on your radio so you could be the DJ.
---
Granted my luck would get me 15 copies of Shenandoah....
---
At what age have you formed opinions of the world around you?
---
If anyone is still having problems you have to go to Doccuments &gt; My Games &gt; Fallout76. Then go to Fallout76Prefs.ini , right click and click properties. Under properties make sure read only isn't checked off. 
---
It would be cool but only on the pip-boy. Adds to the risk of typing/texting in a irradiated hellscape. 
---
Make it a pip-boy 2000 vault 76 only feature. 
---
"Go away rAiDeRs I'm AIMing with HotGirl69!!!!!11!!11!"
---
Its hilarious you're saying that on this subreddit. Enjoy having shit excuses for a game.
---
Sweet! Any idea on a rough time so I can make some plans? 
---
A BoS/Enclave DLC!
---
I‚Äôll check out yours if you‚Äôre there first. 
---
The game functions well as is. We're out of beta now. I know a lot of people run into thing and certain things are indeed broken (i.e. bulk scrapping when you scrap all). But other than that, I've run into very few issues since the last couple updates. 
---
Yes br√∂ther. 
---
Sunk cost fallacy. I was the same myself for a while, ignored all the bugs and crashes and enemies spawning right in my face - because its fallout and I'm supposed to love fallout (plus I spent ¬£50 so I gotta get my moneys worth). Eventually realised it wasn't for me but just admitting that to myself was hard. 
---
Very useful against ghouls. Take out their legs, makes them pathetic.
---
Considering the value of materials to value given by the vendor: definitely the Halloween Skeleton Costume.   
---
It costs 2 cloth + 5 plastic to make.   
---
With the Super Duper perk maxed, you get quite a lot of these for not too much ingredients.
---
Its value is 250 caps so you get 38 caps from a vendor for it.   
---
The only downside is that obtaining the plan for these means taunting and repetitive server hopping at Random Encounter spots, but as soon as you get it, you're good to go.  
---
Isn't something like this in the roadmap? They said something about a boy scout backpack that added "utility"
---
What console is this beauty on?
---
I have seen random unexploded bombs in the green zone. 
---
Read here you can try to defuse them ... success yields nuke material and some other stuff.
---
Clip the wrong wire....
---
I rock an anti armor Gatling plasma with maxed out big guns. Its a lot of fun as a melee player having the option, but overall they're only useful against scorchbeasts. Theyre fine when you have all of the relevant perks, but you can't change on the fly easily and really have to be dedicated to one or the other. Without increased reload speed it's very hard. 
---
41 hops before find one
---
forget adding an Alpaca radio, I just want one to help carry junk around so I‚Äôm not encumbered constantly.
---
That's a different area, Alpine River Cabins back near Vault 76.
---
I found a spear yesterday and thought, oh cool a long range melee. But then my char started holding it at the tip for some insane reason so it isn't any longer than a dagger.
---
In Fonline (the bootleg Fallout Online engine with a few dozen unique variations built on a hacked copy of Fallout 2 by crazy ass Russians years ago) we had chat, but with radios.  you had like 50k channels, so it was pretty much security through obscurity.  You'd tell someone face to face in game that you'll both use channel 34556, then whenever you were apart you were carrying a radio tuned to that channel.  If they started talking it'd pop up in a different color from normal chat to let you know you were getting radioed.

All these threads about the SBQ and hidden meaning of closing fissures...  Screws, screws are the REAL end-game in Fallout 76.
---
I love my Plasma Gatling.  It‚Äôs a 3 star legendary though Two Shot Explosive which doesn‚Äôt drop anymore.  It‚Äôs my go to gun.  Also have a two shot explosive Gatling Gun which I bought (for caps)  off a player.  I love that one too.
---
I‚Äôve been doing this. Mostly to get quest rewards at max level. 
---
There are a few ways to speed up the process. 
---
There‚Äôs a 3 point charisma perk (Inspirational?) that increases eco by 15% in a group. Well tuned I believe is 5% exp. can get an extra 10% from cranberry relish. 
---
Cranberries are plentiful near a farm in the north west corner of the map (I made my camp there), gourds are easy to grow and you can stockpile enough snaptail reeds to make hours worth of sugar for your relish by running from Point Pleasant south along the river until you hit the hotdog van. 
---
That‚Äôs 30% straight off the bat, and there are probably more ways to increase it. I got from 30-40 doing events and capturing workshops in less than a day. 
---
I know it detracts from the whole ‚Äòplay slowly‚Äô if you‚Äôre min-maxing the details, but it does help speed up progress to a complete build. 
---
... One thing I‚Äôve learned after 25 years underground ‚Äî you never know WHAT will walk through that door. 
---
20 hours since the last trade?  
---
I thought it was 20 hours from beginning the interaction, so that if I sell c100 to a vendor at midnight and the other c100 at 8am, things reset at 8pm.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fun until they run out and there‚Äôs no people or quests to do 
---
Thank you for the info 
---
I can help you kill ten in about 20 minutes. I'll be on in an hour or so. I'm mr_blonde93

I buy and sell ammo to other players regularly.
---
If you can get headshots fine without VATS, then there's no real point to focus on VATS, unless you also plan to focus on Crits.  Outside of Crits, the only point to VATS is to either lock on to/locate mobs or hit them if you need a crutch(shots fired/pun inteneded).
---
I like that certain junk items are harder to come by than others. But we should ve able to get screws by scrapping weapons. 
---
I feel like its mandatory to loot whitesprings and sugar grove every day to keep up with my need for screws.
---
Anything ranged, just been loving my simple berserker build but it's hard to get items because to most they are pretty worthless XD
---
I would think anywhere near flatwoods, or the first overseers camp south of V76 would work.  
---
Even as a 33, I go back to those regularly.  Usually dropping stuff in the overseers cache....but since my camp is far north and I'm too overencumbered to fast travel, that point is central, adn has all the workbenches I need.
---
I just wish it had one, I love my harpoon gun but it would be nice to make it more viable for SBQ
---
(Denzil voice) ‚ÄúMy man!‚Äù

I‚Äôve been finding tons of lose screws lately.  Specifically the last week.  Even finding them on super mutants when I never did before.  But yes, we should be able to craft them as well.

I'm currently a Combat Medic.  I was not born in the vault, I was a commanding officer in the military with an education in medicine.  My expertise with medicine net me a spot in the vault, what good are the brightest and best if they're sick?  When the bombs fell I barely made it to the vault in time, as a result I've got a weird affinity for radiation as I took a large dose initially.  25 years passed, I made a few friends in the vault, one of them was a mentally unstable person with a problem with violence but proclivity towards kindness.  He's an architect.  I befriended him when he helped defend me from a patient who stole some of my stock's Psycho and OD'd going on a violent spree.  He one hit that guy in the face and knocked him out cold.
---
When the vault opened we went our seperate ways looking to rediscover our old lives.  I found only a looted burned and wrecked apartment where I used to live, the bones of my pet were present laying next to her food bowl.  I had worried about her, but knew what was likely and was grateful she wasn't mutated into an abomination like vault-tec had warned us could happen.  My friend however had a lover he hadn't yet married, and was the source of his anger in the vault as they didn't allow her in with him, immediate family only.  He found a letter of hers at her old home, she left to seek shelter at a bunker in the mire, but passed by Huntersville...  He found her bones stripped clean of meat, the only indicator being a note next to her skeleton addressing him.  It messed him up.  He went mad and became a sort of...  Barbarian.  He's vowed to hunt down every last super mutant and make them extinct.  I am the only one who he isn't hostile towards albeit, he isn't hostile towards random vault dwellers, just anyone who hurts him or me.
---
As for me, I was jaded from the prewar situation to begin with, went into medicine to ease suffering, to balance the suffering I saw everywhere.  When I reconnected with my friend I had already surmised the threat and problem plaguing the immediate area.  I sought out the remnants of government, while helping my friend exact revenge on those that murdered his loved one.  Our journeys led us to the enclave, through the glassed caverns, and into the seceded free states territories.  We realized the futility of correcting the situation, with nothing short of an army to genocide the scorched being needed, we decided to make civilization in our own way in our little corner of Whitesprings.  He constructed and opened a shop to trade, he despises Grahm but at my suggestion leaves him be when he passes through.  He trades with other dwellers, and I supply him with chems, booze, and aid supplies for a mild compensation.  He supplies me with ammo, weapons, and armor he trades for.
---
I wander the area solo now helping any dweller who's in pain, and when I find those vault dwellers whom have turned lost their minds to violence, I call my friend and we put them down.  There's no room for violent vault dwellers in a world of violent mutants, ghouls, and scorched.
---
I found the Order of Mysteries, and supplemented my combat style with their stealth techniques.
---
Finally, I gained a plasma thrower, gauss rifle, lever action rifle, combat rifle, and handmade rifle from my friend, and have been cleansing the world of every zombie, mutant, and scorched there is.
---
We may never be successful.  We may even one day become one of the very things we've sought to destroy outright...
---
But we thrived and flourished and prospered in a place where so many died.
---

I support this idea, with a varying chance of the ammo detonating in your face.

I‚Äôve kept a two shot Gatling laser from shortly after launch.  Still waiting, don‚Äôt hold your breath.

Ooo. Vertibirds would be cool.

And throws super mutant suiciders, now that would be one hell of a fight.
---
When they actually implement private servers where you have control of other players and can set rules preventing PVP in a game that contains and promotes PVP is when your idea of Tip #2 will supercede the will of others.
---
Passive mode is to prevent you from accidently engaging and gaining a bounty, not to prevent others from killing you indiscriminately.
---
I agree, but I don't  think most are asking to nerf melee, only to buff ranged.
---
Fighting large tanky creatures is where you really see the advantages of melee, fighting the SBQ and blowing through all your ammo is a major disadvantage to ranged. Also, for some reason ranged weapons even seem to break faster, I always have 5 point gun nut or whatever its called equipped, while I never use the melee weapon durability perk and my melee weapon lasts forever while my shotgun from 200% durability and the perk can only do about 600 rounds before breaking.
---
I have a 4-shot legendary id like to rename to "the Hellsing". But people could call their weapons naughty words in a game where you can commit cannibalism and nuclear war so it's still just a dream lol
---
at least it wasn't broken when you sold it. I accidentally did that (with a unique no less), and you can't buy broken weapons back from vendors.
---
You should google that and realize your ignorance.
---
When I was 5 my whole world got shaken up when I discovered Cartoon Network. Does that count?
---
Well, I think you‚Äôre missing the trees for the forest- due to the current VATS system, a non-vats small guns build basically is nonviable. Which means there‚Äôs consequences to a VATS build- there should be. I‚Äôm kind of thinking most/all VATS boosting perks should also increase AP cost to compensate. 
---
And re:adrenaline- only true in group play, so it depends on your playstyle. I‚Äôll agree about vulnerability though; that‚Äôs the trade off to melee damage
---
Can you do a prime receiver for a Gatling Gun?

Why the hell aren‚Äôt there global events!? This would be perfect to set up a global quest line to collect records and cassettes and once the community hits the goal, they flip a switch and new song get added for everyone. Make world changes fun Bethesda.

Agreed. Just the other night I spent 35 caps traveling to One Violent Night, arrive there only to see that there is less than 2 minutes remaining on the timer. Wow.
---
thank's for the reply.  yeah i was going through more of them last night and i got the same thing for "big enemies" too 10/13.   hoping they will see this and maybe try to fix it sooner rather then next year.
---
Worked for equipment and weapon swapping as well as local map tracking in Fallout 4; I kept [a tablet running this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bethsoft.falloutcompanionapp) next to my computer all the time for that. Granted, not saying it's easy to accomplish, just that it's not that far-fetched.
---
Red Dead isnt a great comparison. Yeah the online isnt up to snuff but the multiplayer is an addon to a story driven single player game. If F076 had an offline story driven narrative to explore I'd probably still be playing it.
---
You have to say that with a Canadian accent, Goalie Ledoux...
---
lol k
---
Or an instigating minigun
---
Take my upvote. I‚Äôve got a 3* bloodied shiskebab I‚Äôd love to use 1 day. 
---
And for the record, I hope you do get private PVE servers. I doubt they'll ever actually be implemented because Bethesda, but would be nice for you.
---
Vampire outfit + monocle + top hat + + curly moustache + crossbow = elegant and prestigious vampire hunter if you consider scorch beasts vampires lol
---
Right?
---
yeah just hit all of them once..xp time!!!
---
anti-armour dragon
---
Ah, diminishing returns? First I‚Äôd heard of it. And I wonder about concentrated fire. Might have to test that. I know you can‚Äôt target limbs with melee, but I wonder if that also excludes the damage bonus.
---
I must be playing wrong. Level 120 here and I never run out, drop excess often, and never farm them specifically ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And if you fall out, you‚Äôre stuck running around fighting
---
Why do you balk at scavenging this specific crafting component? It's cool to go out and farm gears, steel, oil, nuclear material &amp; lead but somehow screws are too much for you?
---
I hear you there. If you find anything with crit bonus perks those aren't too bad for the SBQ. I run heavy weapons and shotguns mostly and I've modded a few to prime receivers just to use up some of the flux I've stockpiled.
---
Don't explosive mods work weird with weapons that have actual projectiles?
---
I thinking more along the idea that some one would use it to swap builds mid fight. Which would blow. 
---
You can get springs for days in clipboards. I pick up every one I see.
---
Anytime pal.
---
Man I know, but this was like 30 min
---
You gave away the holy secret. The Bulk and Atom Trust is on their way to your camp to make sure this never happens again.
---
Good for wandering low level areas.
---
Agreed. I like your idea, and it's better than my "take over the nearest workshop" idea because it fits the aesthetic of the game. I've only been on this forum a month, and while I've seen incredible amounts of negativity, I don't recall having seen the minicamp idea suggested in that time, nor do I see where you claimed you were the only person in the history of the universe to have thought of it.
---
Or bulk it and sell/scrap it so I wouldn‚Äôt have to trust trade to sell a &lt;1cap/round
---
not using a DJ is a missed opportunity. Other than a great chance to toss out lore and other funnies, a DJ could be used to ID players to unmarked points of interest, to highlight events that have started. Game patches could introduce a new set of DJ cues. 
---
Should a had a DJ of some kind. We have not one but two robot mayors, and Rosie blithers on and off on her radio... why not a real DJ? seems odd. 
---
Because the drop rate compared to the usage rate is lower than gears, springs, and everything else.
---
Also, if I have sufficient skill to turn a pot into a gun, I have sufficient skill to turn a pot into many screws.
---
after getting th info from sugar grove i went back and the doors wont open
---
Of course it will break before you need to reload. /s but not really /s
---
That‚Äôs the idea. 
---
Over 120 with perks. Really unless you've got sick legendary perks for it it's really only good for sneaking or wandering low level places.
---
my daughter LOVES to watch me play fallout76 once in full moon but im very careful where i go when shes watching me.  she loves the content but sometimes gets scared when 4-5 ghouls pounce me.  i try to avoid human corpses or body parts and i try to fight robots mostly.  this game surely isnt appropriate for little kids.  
---
then again its possible that 5 year old wasn't really 5 years old.  but overall current generation of kids arent like us when we were growing up.  they adopt tech at a VERY early age.  my daughter can already jump on my fallout character and play.  i'll catch her jumping on hotseat and walking around and looking at my inventory when i go take a PEE break(until i kick her off)
---
What I find dumb is that Bethesda never even thought ohh maybe people might want some sort of ingame chat functionality, what about those folks that are deaf ect. Or maybe I'm playing late at night next to a sleeping baby so I really can't voice chat. Massive oversight in a multiplayer game. 
---
Man, when I logged in yesterday, it insta-completed some of the daily AND weekly challenges. I‚Äôm grateful but confused. Junk was one.
---
They nerfed it in patch 5 IIRC. I haven't check on it since then. Seems by the by. I get the argument, but if you play without VATS crits it should probably be because you need your AP for something else, not because you feel that VATS is icky. VATS is a huge return on investment for damage.
---
What you should do is get a fucking life. You ‚Äúgave up on this sub‚Äù, yet here you are, shitting on people. Go on then, move on with your life, go be better than everyone somewhere else. 
---
But do you honestly need every single level of adrenaline, or just one or two? 
---
I farm and it‚Äôs surprising all the screws I accumulate.  Don‚Äôt ignore clipboards! 
---
Someone get this guy a sad violin please
---
Nails even aren't too simple. Just ask Tacitus. 
---
I tried it right after the TSE nerf and did not see increasing chunks with each hit. IMO it should, but I'm fine that you can't target body parts with melee
---
I meant springs! 
---
I always Rob the whitesprings toy store when I log in.
---
Actually, it isn't.
---
That story is about the suppliers not being willing to buy high-speed screw production machines only to meet Apple's demand.  The limitation is entirely financial, not technical.
---
They'd run one machine for a month to satisfy Apple's entire yearly demand and then have it idle for the remaining 11 months.
---
Blue suitcase, but yeah, even that won't work all the time.
---
Mothman must die...
---
My first Mothman kill was purely a mistake.  
---
I was fresh out of the Vault, exploring this new world and just trying to survive.  I was wandering the woods near Huntersville and suddenly he was there, the Wise Mothman.   
---
Not knowing what to do, on edge because of lack of sleep, water, and food, I did what any reasonable Vault Dweller would do, I attacked using my sniper rifle from range.  He didn‚Äôt defend himself or fight back.  Soon he was dead.  
---
The whole encounter left me confused.  Who was this Mothman?  Why did he not fight back?  Is he friendly and kind?   
---
Well, as I was soon to find out, he is neither friendly nor kind.....!!!
---
The second Mothman kill was for pure Survival
---
Not long after I encounter the Mothman Mob hitman, the Vengeful Mothman.  
---
I was traveling down the road on the way back to my camp near Huntersville, minding my own business.  Out of nowhere a Mothman appears in the woods on the edge of the road. 
---
After the last encounter, I figured that I would talk to Mothman and explain how sad I was to have killed his brother. As I approached I heard this angry chittering sound coming from his wings.  Still, I persisted.  
---
I walked up to him with my weapon down and that‚Äôs when he pounced.  His shock wave pounded me like a hammer, I was bruised and bleeding.  I backed off quickly, took a couple of stim packs, and then pulled out my machine gun.  
---
The next thing that I knew, he was behind me.  He was so quick that it was hard to get oriented.  I finally got a bead on him and started fighting back.   It was touch and go for a bit, but I prevailed.  If I had one less Blood Pack I would have died, but I SURVIVED.....
---
The last two Mothman kills were for sport
---
It‚Äôs now been 5 years since leaving the Vault.  I‚Äôm now much better equipped and have developed new skills.  I‚Äôve taken on Deathclaws, Gulpers, and Scorch Beasts.  
---
So you can imagine that the last two encounters with Mothman have been more for sport, but also with a touch of sadness that the feud goes on.   Yes, I could have walked away, but I knew that he would just keep coming. 
---
The last Mothman had no chance.   I was in power armor and pulled out my TSE shotgun and the fight was over before it began.  
---
However, before finishing him off I pulled out my camera and took a photo of him in full glory, wings fully spread, hovering over me, light shining through the bullet holes in his wings, eyes glowing...
---
‚Äúthis is it‚Äù,  I thought.   
---
‚Äúthis is a true and fitting monument to our feud.  it will forever serve as a reminder of a once feared enemy....‚Äù
---
Belief is that the Mire stuff was triggered by something from the Vault up there, and is at best ambivalent towards the scorched, at worst competitive/hostile to the scorched. 
---
I just dump the ammo I'm not using into the Overseer's Stash in Flatwood. I've just read about some other common dump sites as well at places like Whitesprings and the various train stations, so I may start using those as well.
---
I want to love my crossbow..I have a two shot crossbow and it overwhelmingly meh.
---
Even if they just gave us something to speed up the reload it would be nice, but a variety of bolts to craft and a boost in power for it would be awesome.
---
The experience of downing a target with the crossbow is great, the sounds and "feel" of the weapon is great.  But getting hammered while slowly reloading 15 times to get a kill is not so great
---
This.  Give us Reloading benches darn it!
---
Would be cool if a few folks started an external stream and DJed for the game, even if the stream wasn't 24/7.
---
with [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and [perkloadoutmanager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) you can probably do it faster than you could reaching for an external device and shifting cards around (assuming there's nothing like perkloadoutmanager for the companion app). Heck, now that I think about it, I'm gonna have to set that up tonight. \[alt\]\[1\] through \[alt\]\[8\], here we come!
---
I had one just outside the whitesprings train station, I kept looking around trying to figure out what's shaking the entire map, it went so long it couldn't be a normal explosion.
---
The lore for the area does include seismic activity because of the underground nukes, so I assume it's related to that.
---
Came here to point and laugh at energy weapons while crying inside.
---
Plasma weapons used to be super buggy and not even hit all the time because they fired an actual projectile with travel time, not hitscan like most guns. That‚Äôs been fixed.
---
However they still break unreasonably fast and are annoying to repair, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs one of the biggest factors currently
---
That's epic! :)
---
Hah, where is this at if you don't mind me asking?
---
I have a .50 nocturnal that reduces damage output by a shitload and increases defense by 250 during reload. Great SB deleter when it's not broken.
---
I can see why they initially didn't but it's absurdly ridiculous that even the normal factions not using high tech stuff won't accept common bullets in a trade.
---
I'd be happy with 5 10mm selling for 1 cap, and 2 .50 rounds selling for 1 cap, 10 .38 for 1 cap, 4 .308 for 1 cap.
---
And prewar money should sell for 1 cap for every 10.
---
Please.  Honestly, I like guns... but trying to kill anything with a firearm in this game is infuriating.  The guns do crap for damage, need ammo and break like they are made of cheap plastic.  I'm currently running around with a mole miner gauntlet and once I picked up a mini gun and about 100 rounds for it.  I thought this would be fun... kill a few baddies and drop the gun.  100 rounds into a ghoul (probably like 75 with my aim) got it to about half life.  I know I'm not built for heavy guns but it should still do more than that...  I don't know how you gun people manage.....
---
I didn't, hence why I want them to bring it back. I'm just saying with OPs logic anyone that's been playing it for however long deserves it when others don't. 
---
Inb4 fallout 76 battle Royale..... pour me shot of bleach. 
---
Not sure what you mean. Which weapons are you thinking of?
---
They fixed most if not all.
---
That‚Äôs. Actually a good idea. 
---
 Well an unbattered one has a screw. ;)
---
Fallout has been about tactics since inception. VATS has been part of that. Most FPS games are about skill. The FPS style in fallout is about strategy. If you want traditional FPS mechanics, I think traditional FPS games are what you need - not that this game needs to change.
---
Not necessarily. But as I've progressed in the game, found better weapons and armor, my plat style changes. Adrenaline is just the example I used because it has 5 ranks. When I was a lower level, having level 4 was great for killing mobs. Now its just overkill and I could drop a rank or 2 for something elsem
---
And to answer your question, idk. I would like to experiment with it at 1, 2, 3, and 4 and then decide which is best right now. And even if I decided I want, say, level 3, I might want to drop it to 2 and pick up another perk later.
---
You linked Wikipedia as a source to backup your claim, Wikipedia isn‚Äôt a valid reliable source. Not to mention the page you link says nothing to backup your claim that the entire studio is still working on the game.
---
It is common practice for a majority of a dev team to be assigned to a new project after their previous project has been finished and released. Why would this project be any different? Why should we believe some dude who links Wikipedia as a source lmao. Based on what we‚Äôve gotten so far from updates and patches, there is no way the entire studio is still working on the game. 
---
Not only crossbows but literally 50% of the weapons need more, interesting mods.
---
It's a post-apocalyptic game. We should be able to build weapons mods with junk we find.
---
I'd like a crossbow firing saw blades with chance to bounce when hitting a wall.
---
The possibilities are literally endless.
---
I'm hoping future dlcs will bring those mods.
---
Just take the workshop in the Northwest, at the end of the toxic valley (I forget it's name, something golf related).  It has 3 acid extractors.
---
Gimme 3 "screw extractors" and I'm happy.  (junk extractors produce a lot of things that do not contain screws.)
---
Basically, if I wanted to make a new set of ultracite power armor, I'm not sure if it would take me longer to farm the ultracite or the screws.  And farming the ultracite would be level-appropriate.  One-shotting low-level mobs while I pick up screw-containing junk isn't.
---
Go away dude
---
Isn't there a mod for this?
---
Amen.
---
I was so pumped when the first clip of a crossbow was shown, only to find out on release that they're fucking useless. Sad day.
---
I mean, there‚Äôs only a few perks directly related. Anything else is up to you. Ordinance express to carry all the ammo. Bear arms to carry the weapons. Stabilized for armor reduction. Demolition expert for damage. Grenadier for explosion radius. 
---
My clown suit don't help, much :D
---
Best shop i have ever visited! Thank you again for the quick and easy Trades!Also thanks for modding my T-51. :)
---
It‚Äôs not an add-on. 
---
And yes, it is a fine comparison. Red Dead was in development for triple the amount of time as FO76. This is also not Rockstar‚Äôs first major online game, unlike Bethesda.
---
I don‚Äôt play on pc but most of the people I know use discord or something like that.  Adrenal is still bugged I believe and rad worms feels like it works. 
---
I think he means you can control a camp safe using the camp terminal?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt let mine when they were younger. But people are very lax in what they let their kids do. 
---
Like others have said, it‚Äôs knowing what to look for.   
---
Other than what has already been posted, Toys, billiard balls, brooms, toothpaste, toothbrush, and enamel buckets also have plastic. 
---
I really like the game and don‚Äôt play much but I have no complaints except it does seem pretty empty with no NPCs and never enough PC‚Äôs running around. 
---
That may have been exactly what they were going for, which is fine, but I‚Äôm allowed to not like it. 
---
But that‚Äôs really my only criticism and isn‚Äôt even close to being game breaking for me. 
---
Orly? Meh.
---
&gt;which is just the tuba?
---
Which, by the way, is actually considered a brass instrument rather than any kind of wind instrument.
---
I was being funny. But clearly your humor stat is too low. 
---
They got instarolled by a scorchbeast as soon as the live feed went up, and left crying after 3 minutes of continuous sonic blasts and acid gas.
---
The German team was brutally murdered and the others then retreated back into the Vault. 
---
&gt; Can you enjoy this game without friends?
---
Sure, but the most fun I've had is when I've teamed up with folks spontaneously. It feels a lot lonelier than 4, which doesn't really make sense. Perhaps it's the lack of NPCs, or just occasionally seeing players run by and not communicate. 
---
Seems most people don't have mics.
---
Haha. At least that's fixed now. But seriously, I'm down to watch a their stream if they make it happen. Kinda sad that they announced a time and day and it didn't. 
---
Because it's a stupid concept. 
---
Typically Id just take out their head with one shot but yeah. I used this on Deathclaws in 3, but it was a dart gun with instant limb cripple. OP.
---
Oh that is strange! Could you send me a message on here with your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name and character name?
---
I throw steel on the ground. Screws haven't been an issue for me in 100 levels though. I usually sell them in bulk to vendors. Can't think of what I keep scrapping to get so many.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Did the stream happen or is this jokes?
---
Does this happen every time or frequently? If so can you send me a DM with your character name and [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) username?
---
Can you DM me your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name and character name?
---
This kid's entire life is going to be influenced by Fallout if he plays enough
---
I‚Äôve got 1k screws, gears, and springs on two characters. Any amount I get over 1k I sell to vendors. I repair my weapons when they go under 100% back up to 200%. I don‚Äôt see what the problem is, and although you raise a strong point about not being able to craft screws which we should obviously know how to do, I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre struggling so bad to get them that you had to make a whole post about it.
---
Also I have that amount after going through thousands of them learning mods for the radium rifle. Maybe you just need to scavenge and play the game more, getting any material in this game is easy.
---
We would only have to wait 175 in-game years to listen to Three Dog do his thing.
---
I had a 3 star zealots gatling plasma but I'd put 2 cores through it and it'd break. That's with a 200% starting durability.  Sold it for 30 caps to the vendor.
---
Hey there, I'm interested to hear more on this. Can you send me a DM with your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name and character name?
---
TLDR: My experience players are not getting more aggressive. Opposite in fact, their getting more friendly. 
---
I've been playing since beta as well and I have 4 characters 99, 31, 11, 5, main, PvP, social and an extra one. I have only been attacked 4 times. The first 2 I attribute to tools who bought the wrong game, early in the game. One was a fortnite stray, jumping around, the other was a squeaker trying to get nuclear codes. The later 2 were more what I imagine people are complaining about. One shot me with an explosive something or other, fortunately the game glitched and I took no damage. I first attributed it to my healing factor but my last encounter proved that wrong. For whatever reason, I got to taunt him by vomiting on him. Last one I spawned into a lobby hearing someone commenting on his new weapon doing 600 damage. Of course when he had seen me, he started hitting me with his power fist, if only I had a gamma gun because my unstable isotope took his health down to 1/3rd. He was taking large chunks of my health so I understood what I would be going against of a engaged but un-engaged, nothing a stimpac couldn't handle. I took to vomiting again, after awhile he gave up, I fixed my armor and left. I have no idea if my healong factor was glitched here or before. 
---
On the other side I've been more outgoing, waving at players and they've been waving back. I've been dropping off extra resources for low levels and others have been dropping items for my low levels. 
---
I don't deny you've been trolled, it's just my experience has been very positive. 
---
Your right, something is coming on May 7th about a utility backpack, what all is involved in that, we'll have to wait an see.
---
Rifles are fine if you have a good one and you crit often. Throw on adrenaline and gun fu and you're golden. Heavy weapons feel like they've become harder to play, but if you're not bound to using AP for VATS you can have damn good survivability with dodgy eating your AP up.
---
Don't get me wrong, melee's fun, but it's not quite as OP as people make it out to be. It's just a different play style. It has it's advantages and disadvantages, no different than any other build.
---
I second this. I‚Äôve only been active here a small time and I‚Äôm already tired of see that. 
---
As a parent myself I would not let my kid(7) play this game. Hell I don't let him play fortnite and it seems everyone let's their kids play that from the way I hear him talk about the kids in his class playing it. Maybe it's because I've been gaming for so long and I know how these games are but I feel that kids nowadays are getting exposed to too much in games because parents are just plain ignorant of what is actually happening in them. 
---
You don't have to look to far back in history to see how many times parents have made poor choices when it comes to exposing their kids to mature content in media like Dead Pool , Any Grand Theft Auto game and Mortal Kombat. That said it is up to each parent to decide if their child has reached the maturity level required to play any game. 
---
I was waiting for the spinning animation to end in a massive explosion. 
---
(Instead of the car bomb/grenade warning icon, it would be a pram). 
---
Nah. Not the same loot tables. SB don‚Äôt drop legendaries. They do rarely drop plans though. 
---
One of subRedditors here did actually kill the four-person German Bethesda team mid-streaming.  They attacked him and he killed the entire team not realizing it was being streamed.  
---
tagging everyone in this train of comments here u/kephalonix u/geneziza u/rillion25   
---
Can you all send me your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name and character name? (Also if this isn't on xbox let me know what console you're seeing this on.)
---
Can you DM me with your character name and [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) username? 
---
Definitely doesn‚Äôt do more slap damage. I haven‚Äôt tested beyond that. 
---
Oh wow. 
---
 That happened to me once. Forgot to put on PA, and it kept respawing me closer to the center of the nuke zone. Eventually had to run to the SW corner in 5 second death/sprint spurts to get out so I could put it on. 
---
 Never laughed so hard..
---
I see this often and I assume it's because people don't know you can get a lot of screws from Abandoned Bog Town. 
---
&gt;  2shot has no perk options to buff it
---
Two-shot scales directly with literally everything else that increases your weapon damage. In any case you can't compare two-shot to explosive because explosive is a suffix - it competes with the likes of "+10% damage while aiming" (and thoroughly outclasses them all).
---
&gt; This nerf made the 2shot effect pretty damn useless.  
---
It's still the 2nd best *unconditional* legendary prefix which is hardly "useless".
---
&gt; Anti armor (edit, melee weapons) should ignore more of your enemies armor, or stack with incisor. Tests have proved this effect is useless with melee if you use incisor.  
---
Don't know where you are referencing for these "tests" but this is completely un-true. Anti-armor stacks with Incisor, Tank Killer and other armor ignoring affects just fine. It grants an actual +28.9% damage increase against anything with non-trivial amounts of armor which makes it the best *unconditional* legendary prefix.
---
Every other legendary prefix is absolutely broken one way or the other - being too strong or too weak. They should be normalized so that they are all viable choices.
---
Is there somewhere to watch that, or did they scrap the footage?
---
LoL over it.  .. good luck to you and yours.  
---
Im really looking forward to playing it, i have a copy coming in the mail today so wish me luck!
---
&gt;Nuka Grape vendor
---
Bless you, good sir! I had no idea this existed. So far my vendor forays have only involved looking for plans, and I've only been inside the resort to find the seven holotapes. You just changed my gameplay!
---
&gt;What I find dumb is that Bethesda never even thought
---
Period.  They didn't think anything through for this game from update to update it's one shitshow after another.
---
For anyone unfortunate enough to have bought the official strategy guide, you can see just from the perks section how much and how badly they nerfed this game.  Some listed perks aren't even in the game, others aren't listed accurately.  Seriously, even their strategy guide, the *official* strategy guide, is inaccurate with bad advice.
---
Jeff Gardiner may there be mercy upon you, your name signed on the foreword of that product, it will forever haunt you.
---
I highly suggest you stay away for now OP as the game still has a myriad of serious bugs.  Unsynced and inaccurate displays on the social menu, menus will randomly sell/scrap/drop stuff in other tabs you're not even on.  Invincible enemies and enemies who take damage but then instantly heal from every hit (not legendaries mutating).  Items duping in your inventory then Bethesda says you're exploiting for having the misfortune of a bug occur to them.
---
They told players to break their game early, then banned the players who did and then some innocent people who just played normally.
---
Check back in a month or two.
---
Explosives are typically against (physical/ballistic) Damage Reduction. Things like Plasma Grenades are a little different. 
---
I‚Äôve tested an AA M79 vs a normal M79, with and without the Stabilized perk. AA did more damage than normal, AA+Stabilized did even more. 
---
So yes, armor reduction works with ( most) explosives. 
---
What I don't get is that weapon balance in FO4 was pretty good by the end. You can't make everyone happy, but it didn't feel badly off.
---
Why didn't they just use the same variables as FO4, at least for the legacy weapons? There may be a technical reason. Let me know if there is. 
---
I just couldn't get into it because I started with guns :( Way too much homework collecting resources, couldn't really enjoy the exploration.
---
&gt; Because the drop rate compared to the usage rate is lower than gears, springs, and everything else.
---
There is always a bottle-neck, you'll complain about gears next if you get your wish.
---
But what do I know, I just have an ever-increasing stockpile of over 600 screws last time I looked and that's after crafting hundreds of each kind of armor to learn modifications.
---
Some of us learn the mods for more than one gun.
---
Let's say I wanted to make another set of ultracite power armor.  It has two limiting components: screws and ultracite.
---
One I farm at level-appropriate locations, doing end-game content that requires actually paying attention to what's going on around me to avoid being overwhelmed.
---
One I farm by walking through random low-level buildings I have walked through hundreds of time, paying little attention to the mobs beating on me except to occasionally slaughter the angry mob.
---
The latter is not particularly good game design.  And since I'm swimming in some other farmable materials that I should be able to turn into screws given everything else I can do, why not be able to do it at a horrifically terrible exchange rate to avoid poor game design?
---
Yea boy!!!
---
You obviously missed the TSE nerf postsunami, and the "I'mma never playin this game again, buhbye forever!", post bannination wave threads. 
---
"Bethesda, please" posts are a breath of fresh air, comparatively.
---
You were shooting at him. And he hadn‚Äôt hit you yet because you didn‚Äôt die to his bloodied super sledge? You were doing slap damage, so capped at 5 damage/second. Yeah, you weren‚Äôt doing much to him. 
---
Yes and no. My friends and I tried that. It was fun for a bit but eventually the bad things crept in. Like every time I played I would get stuck in something. Walk by a shelf stuck. Fighting a scorchbeast  fall through the map up to my chest just out of the blue there was no hole to fall through.  starting to take a workbench game disconnects. Farming some creatures get get sime craftables they become invincable and have to change servers like 5 times to fix it. 
---
Oh thanks it had been days since I checked reddit and I was running low on cringe.
---
Wouldn't yours be low? It's your joke that sucked.
---
Hahaha, no way. My 2* AA The Dragon with 25% faster fire rate is a gem!
---
I don't think I've ever felt so helpless than when a scorchbeast ganked me and proceeded to enshrine my ample screw collection like some avaricious dragon. Honestly felt like starting from scratch when I finally gave it up. Happy early Christmas for whichever soul was brave enough to claim that fine treasure! 
---
I find building and scrapping armor / guns with my little hoard to be a good way of dealing with it, and less hassle than hunting for now super overpriced plans.
---
Exactly. Who buys a product with zero expectations? üòÇ 
---
It‚Äôs good to get another point of view from different players, sadly I can‚Äôt say all of my p to p experience have been great but it‚Äôs nice to hear when others are having a good time!
---
Is better than a 1* AA The Dragon how?
---
What event?
---
They saved and posted it. He posted the link in his thread.  I didn‚Äôt view it but others who responded to him apparently did. I don‚Äôt recall his name or the name of his post here.  Perhaps searching ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù within this subReddit would find it. 
---
Appreciate the feedback guys, I will make sure this is heard!
---
I am not lol. But I was raised in Batavia and my dad owned a bar/ pool hall/ music venue in Milford called BOCCA! So I‚Äôve met quite a few musicians over the years!! Lol
---
you practically won the lottery, you have an extremely small chance of getting them all. were you doing uranium fever ? 
---
This is a joke right?
---
More like it took you nine days to think of that comeback. Talk about cringe.
---
Got the plan twice if you want it.  On pc
---
Bethesda live streaming through Germany made no sense.
---
As most of us would be from english speaking country's it was unwatchable.
---
Listening to them talk german and not understanding a thing doesnt work.
---
Noticed this yesterday when my friend gave me a plasma gatler to test out.  I repaired it to 200%, around 3.5 cores later it broke...
---
40% bashing damage on anything.
---
Fire rate on black power
---
Nocturnal/mutant/30% on 1 creature type
---
Wanna make some caps lol
---
Actually positive feedback is the exact place we should be bringing our hopes, it wouldn't be the place to start a flame war about canvas bags and TSE, but those of us that deeply love the game should be bringing our hopes to the positive threads. My whole feedback letter is started with my 4 favorite elements of the game, it's framed within the positive.
---
I hate using other game models as an example...but Diablo 3 is one of those games that does this correctly.  There are no nerfs, only buffs.  When PVE gets too easy, they give us a higher difficulty.  
---
I can definitely pass this along!
---
That's the thing...if you're new here, you missed on all the low-effort shit posts that used to happen on the reg.
---
The non-constructive whining, the "I'm quitting because x" posts. The crying about TSE being nerfed. The obvious dupers being banned saying they never did anything wrong.
---
Fact is, "Bethesda please" posts are the most constructive posts that occur. They have been effective. They got the dupers banned, they got us the stash size increases, among other things.
---
There was talk a while ago of some sort of coagulation of "Bethesda plz" requests, but I'm not sure if it ever worked out or still exists.
---
&gt;  I don't want to have to know the most efficient route to all the desk fans in a variety locations
---
This is great and very true
---
I'm not saying remove all bottlenecks.
---
I'm saying *this* bottleneck is too severe, and the current method of alleviating the bottleneck (run through the same low-level buildings over and over again) is not particularly good game design.
---
If I was, say, farming ultracite, I'm doing it in a place that is somewhat level-appropriate and I have to pay attention to what's going on around me.  I'm likely to even get pulled into group content, depending on what other people are doing on the server.  That's a good thing, since Bethesda needs us to want to make friends in the game so we keep playing.
---
If I'm farming screws, blapping that level 5 scorched in the same building I walk through every day only to get screws is not good game design.  Especially because I'm not going to get pulled into any group content since I pass through the building so fast.  And I'm actively making the game worse for the level-appropriate players because I've vacuumed up all the screw-bearing junk and taken their kills.
---
I also have a massive excess of steel.  Which currently only serves to give me caps, inflating my wallet to the point where I break the game's concept of an economy.
---
So convert that massive excess of steel into screws at a horrifically terrible rate.  Better gameplay for me, better gameplay for other players, and you cut down on a cap faucet.
---
No one said to stop Sharing his opinion, he just doesn‚Äôt have to act like an elitist prick who thinks his opinion is law. I like the game but I understand others don‚Äôt. That doesn‚Äôt mean I need to yell at them over the Internet, just get to your point and move on. No insults or belittling. Is that so hard to do?
---
While we‚Äôre on the topic of stuff that does not-nothing, but its benefit is so pointless it‚Äôs effectively useless, then don‚Äôt forget CRIT effects on low-damage high-firerate heavies. 
---
Crossbow has no mods besides a prime receiver.
---
Railway Rifle is broken.  No perks effect it.  However!!!  It's projectiles shoot far beyond what it's range stat claims, you can hit enemies that have faded/unrendered from being far away.  The railway rifle is basically an extreme long range sniper, if you can track a target properly and shoot where it'll be, you can hit enemies over 500 meters away.  Their projectiles seem to have a crazy far range versus other guns.  But again, no perks work on it.
---
I would recommend a Plasma Rifle with a flamer barrel mod, and a Gauss Rifle that's suppressed.
---
It is still usable. Just stash all of you‚Äôre fusion cells except 1, then fire the head, after doing this that particular assaultron head will be fixed as long as it stays in your inventory.
---
I've unfortunately come across a few kids in the game, one as young as 6 or 7. He needed help with something or other and when he joined the voice chat, it was awkward to realize how young he was. 
---
I suppose some parents just don't care, but as someone who went into AOL chatrooms as a young child, I would absolutely be worried about the people my (hypothetical) kid might be talking to.
---
I noticed they don't really pay attention to the story... they mostly just run around and explore and kill things. Still, though. The game is rather violent.
---
I just avoid them. I don't really feel comfortable playing with kids I don't know, and they end up being super annoying about 90% of the time.
---
&gt; I hope that with the new content they will shift more away from single player and head towards needing to work together (the premise of the game is based on rebuilding. Not walking through the wasteland alone)
---
They are going to alienate a portion of their player base if they do that. I wont claim to represent a significant number of people. But if it comes to a point where I *have* to party up to progress, I'll be done. I do party up on occasion. But the day it becomes compulsory will be the last day I play. 
---
Instigating on a low hitter too
---
O u got me
---
Yeah, I popped them all with a few shots for sure.
---
You shouldn't be going to the SBQ event at level 29.
---
Wish I had my nukes on hand.
---
There's a spot in the wiki for the popular suggestions.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz
---
If you see posts with these topics, report them, choosing "Bethesda Plz topic" as the reason. 
---
I'll see that and raise you my ghouls slayer's radium rifle.
---
Thanks for the reply! Feels good to know you‚Äôve been heard! üòÅ
---
The dps on the plasma gatler is really good, if you've a build that makes it work then I applaud you.
---
And beg that you not shoot me with it.
---
PC, though im rebuilding it now
---
Rule of thumb should be if your balls have dropped you can play M games otherwise don‚Äôt let kids pollute their minds early 
---
Wow. Go downvotes (on my post and the whole thread). Did realizing you have fire rate instead of reload speed on your AA dragon upset you? :)
---
I think it‚Äôs a lore reason. If the vault shuts down after 24 hours after leave. Then new players make no sense coming out of a sealed up vault. 
---
It would be nice it the clock rounded while YOU were playing. As time does move forward. 
---
Just farm screws for a day
---
haha very much this.  just dropped 2000 units of steel, 1000 of glass, 1000 of wood because i couldn't build stuff fast enough.  Being able to construct screws/springs/gears would have been very choice.  make it a workshop even!
---
I keep hearing complaints about energy weapons but my Tesla rifle tears stuff up. It also chains to other nearby enemies. Nothing better than a mob of ghouls or charred ones ganging up on you and frying the whole bunch in a couple shots.
---
There is so much great feedback in this, thank you very much! I can tell you spent a lot of time hunting down these ingredients and writing this out and I want to thank you for being so passionate about in game cooking to create this. I'll make sure this is all passed along to the Dev's.
---
Makes sense and glad to know my game isn't bugged
---
I‚Äôll see your radium rifle and raise you a ghoul slayer gamma :P
---
I'm also not a fan of VATS, and melee for the most part has so much less variety than ranged. With ranged you can move around and use your environment, shoot for the head or kneecaps more precisely. Not that you really have to dodge damage in this game, you can just stand and fire/chop then pop stimpacks as needed.
---
Dude I've needed screws so badly...once in awhile I get one but can't figure out what they came from.  Someone told me fans and radios, maybe?  So you do get them with scrapping, right?
---
People who actually want to have fun with the game post here too, and in fallout, your hugbox zero criticism safe zone isn't the only place for people who want to have fun with the game. 
---
Does repairing it past 100% increase the damage/armor or anything like that?
---
Ok, I used those up in about 20 minutes.  Now what?
---
FPS only came with FO3; it didn‚Äôt exist before that. So this game has already changed. Why shouldn‚Äôt it have more combat choices than a binary ‚Äúranged VATS or melee‚Äù? 
---
You do get screws when you scrap certain items?  (Fan is all I know about. Damn screws are hard to come by...)
---
I'd love a solar cannon
---
I mean it could be bugged and be on the low end of fixes. But that‚Äôs the reason I feel it is. 
---
Those guys who "slept in" must feel like slugs when they come out of the vault and people who left the same day are level 200+ decked out in legendaries. 
---
We definitely hear you on event timers. Here is the latest update pulled from our [Know Issues and Feedback list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/);
---
 **Events**
---
* **STATUS:** We are assessing different options as the suggested approach of adding the event timer to the map will not provide accurate feedback about the actual status of the event. Each event has different event failure criteria that correspond to the specific gameplay challenges in the event in addition to the overall timer which is the maximum amount of time players have to complete the event objectives successfully. For example, in a defense objective, the object(s) being protected could be nearly destroyed but there could still be 15 minutes left on the overall timer. While we explore options, we hope you continue to provide your thoughts and feedback on our Events.¬†
---
Where did you find this video of me after drinking a redbull.....
---
Head shots seem reliable with a good sniper rifle so may not need VATS then, I do prefer to look at the world without the VATS overlay, I think that's why I never used VATS, the overlay is just too artificial for my liking.
---
I saw one video where a guy got a similar setup of reqards from uranium fever. But you can be sure this is damn rare.
---
You still around? Just sent you a friend req 
---
I just love the exploration. My favorite part of Bethesda games is the sandbox open world. 
---
I think this is bugged. But its great if it happens to u
---
What did you do?
---
I was thinking the same thing. No wonder people are complaining about lack of content and claiming they have finished the game. Er, no you haven't if you've literally just skipped from one quest to the next in the shortest way possible! 
---
I've played most days since the beta and am only just hitting level 90. I just don't understand why anyone would buy a Fallout game but then play it like CoD or something. 
---
Just bought it for less than 200 caps from the Pleasant valley station vendor... that said I noticed it because this is the first time I've seen these plans
---
Don't forget, scrounging is a different button push.
---
Agreed, the problem is that Bethesda actually does reply, so it incentives everyone to want to say whatever thing they want to see in the game. I'd also like to see a single stickied thread, would be easier for Bethesda to see it all in one place and would clear up the front page
---
I made a new base near a junk pile and placed an extractor just to alleviate some of this headache.
---
Yes buff ranged, I've seen that request allot now, I'm getting the idea that we all want balance in the game and nerfing everything down to a level is not the way, it must be hard though, people say it is almost impossible to balance a game that combines PVE and PVP.
---
I've no idea, not a developer. I can't imaging the coding required.
---
Even with VATS you‚Äôre not safe, unfortunately. One wrong move of the mob or robot and it‚Äôs all over
---
Hello!
---
I am looking for an instigating/VATS/fire rate .44 pistol. Do you have anything like that, or close to it?
---
I miss the Harvester variant from Far Harbor.  So much fun watching mirelurk queens twitch to death.
---
My understanding it is all or none for that drop, with a ridiculously small chance for it to happen.  You will be able to trade some of those for end-game gear.  
---
I‚Äôd much rather it showed the ‚Äúin-game‚Äù time of day.
---
It would occasionally save me from having to check the pip-boy to know which perks are/about to be in effect. 
---
Bethesda, why hype up a game, but then make it shit to play?
---
I solo pretty much the entire game asside from the still extremely buggy scorchbeasts with a hazmat and a shotgun. Nuke zone or not. Stealth is great. I dont see any reason in using armor. A hazmat shits on power armor when it comes to rad protection and even with my XO1 power armor i still get demloished by broken melee enemies. Repairing armor is a waste of resources. The best defense is to never be seen, imo.  Its hilarious when three guys in power armor are gangbanging one ghoul and not putting it down but i destroy it with one headshot.
---
yesterday I scrapped 100 trapper arms and all i got was this lousy tshirt
---
I'd argue that the implementation of VATS and it's evolution are a pretty faithful adaption. Staying faithful to the IP is a little more than just sticking with the same color palette.
---
Shotguns and heavy weapons are already pretty solid third options that don't really benefit much from VATS. Both play quite different as well, so you essentially have 4 big play styles (rifles, melee, heavy guns, shotguns). With those, AP is usually better spent with survivability or mobility. I've never quite done a true pistol build, but I'd imagine it's play style would fall into one of those four play styles. 
---
Which event?
---
Is it still running? That sounds awsome
---
/r/bobsyouruncle
---
This is insane.
---
It's a FALLOUT game, how many people would have no expectations from a 30 year old franchise? 
---
Maybe 1 in 100? So you're basically saying if you're completely ignorant of its heritage you MIGHT just like it.
---
I have an idea! Why not just fucking cater to the MILLIONS of people that already love the franchise to begin with???
---
If you include Wasteland in the timeline (which you should) it's 30 years old.
---
At some point I just made my peace with paying too much too bots for bulk screws and sometimes springs.  Caps aren‚Äôt so hard to come by.  My biggest annoyance is nuclear material cause I love making mines and grenades that cost nuke to make.
---
We're working on a few different idea for unused ammo! Pulled from our [Known Issues and Feedback list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/):
---
**\[ADDED\] Request to have something to do with unused ammo.**
---
* **STATUS:** We are looking into options that will allow players to spend their unused ammo for either caps or other ammo types. We want to be sure any direction we take does not have negative impacts on the economy.
---
So, that‚Äôs P2W.
---
That being said, you can already do it (on PC, if you have a decent computer). Buy a second key of the game. Run two clients, two accounts. There‚Äôs other benefits too. Sharing perk cards, Empath mutation, multiple bases for fast travel/resource gain, getting back into the same server if a client crashes (and keeping the workshops, as if one client crashes, ownership passes to the other). 
---
Fans, some typewriters, some toys, giddyup buttercups and some of their parts.....
---
To make them easier to find, pick up a bunch of junk (especially if it contains screws).  Go to your "junk" panel on your inventory and you can hit a button to change it to "component view".  On component view, you can hit another button to mark particular components (I forget what term they used, but it definitely has mark in it).
---
Now when you see a junk item in the game, it will have a magnifying glass next to it if it contains at least one of the components you marked.
---
I never use VATS, criticals still just happen with normal shots right?
---
Junk pile
---
that's extraordinarily lucky
---
Funny, I always seem to get a full server. I don't think people know how to check how many people are on a server and just count the white dots.
---
Awesome avatar
---
I created a character that uses only melee weapons but added the one ballistic weapon that they can use is a crossbow. So i second this motion. 
---
I have hundreds and hundreds of screws.  Been hoarding since BETA.
---
When player vending is introduced, you will all bow to me!!
---
***BAHAHAHA!***
---
I'm a relative newbie, thanks.  What drives me crazy is when i see a fan or a radio, but you can't pick it up!  DONT DRAW IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, NERDS!
---
The Sons of Danes compound even
---
might be. website is still up [https://www.fonline-reloaded.net/index.html](https://www.fonline-reloaded.net/index.html) I might download it and give it a go at some point.
---
Why post in a forum about a game and then just be an asshole? 
---
Lead in them kids toys mmmm
---
Following the internet on anything related to games is all about outrage and some misplaced sense of "WE DEMAND JUSTICE!"  
---
at least I don't go after whitesprings
---
Oh yeah, that's so smart! Let's just make everything craftable from steel because people crafted things from steel 7000 years ago. This will make the game truly fun!
---
Greatly appreciated!!
---
When you use VATS your critical bar fills. When it is full, you can fire off a crit and it is 100% hit, double damage.
---
Only if you're not good on your VATs timing, even the guaranteed hit will just miss - wasting the crit. Sometimes you end up getting it on the NEXT trigger pull. It's wonky.
---
...If that‚Äôs what happens,I don‚Äôt think those things you are drinking are redbulls.
---
Interesting. Based on a few other peoples testing, the two do in fact stack, but don't add. it's multiplicative. Incisor reduces 75%, AA reduces 50%, together they reduce by 82.75%? the increase of only 7.75% from 3 perk cards/points is pretty whack imo if used together. 
---
with these values, seems like you should only be using one or the other for better overall damage. either 3 points in incisor and a different legendary effect based on your build. or 3 points in something else if you use AA legendary effect weapon.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afs56i/how\_does\_the\_incisor\_perk\_work\_with\_antiarmor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afs56i/how_does_the_incisor_perk_work_with_antiarmor/)

We did have our stream!
---
Unfortunately my scheduled tweet didn't post (My phone did not get reception in our stream room.) But you can watch the VOD right here: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/384935614](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/384935614) 
---
Empath is debate-able. I've heard Empath stacks. If you have all 4 people in your group using it, you will take 99% less team damage but take 33% more damage. Meaning a 66% reduction to damage. I've got to test it. 
---
I don't hate it, but seeing as how salt exists in the game, we should at least be able to cure meats over time to prevent them from spoiling.
---
Some guy also sold me a forest camo jumpsuit for 76 caps. Not a bad day few days its been in the wasteland!
---
Man I agree with you.  I'm a newbie and I only have a few hours in the game, and I'm already bored to tears with the selection (although it's so good I still listen). Hehe.  I wonder if they dont wanna pay for licensing, or...?  It certainly not a technical limitation.
---
yup, you get what I'm talking about.
---
We did have a English stream as well on the 22nd, the tweet about it unfortunately didn't post. But here is the VOD [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/384935614](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/384935614)
---
I can‚Äôt get vendors to buy my broken stuff
---
Generally only play with my roommate, so wouldn't benefit from multiples of it.
---
Wow thanks so much for responding Guys!! 
---
Txs
---
No wacky waving inflatable Deathclaws or Scorchbeasts? Due to a misdirected supply drone maybe? ;)
---
&gt;move around and use your environment, shoot for the head or kneecaps more precisely
---
Never thought about that really, I do have a rifle build and was using a sniper rifle but only went for head shots, never thought about hitting other parts, didn't know that really did anything.
---
Hunting in this game seems a bit sparse, you find nothing for ages but can find mobs easily if you want that isn't OK for a stealth sniper.
---
Perhaps we need more critters in the game. For the hunters to got get.
---
To be fair, I don't think our parents had any understanding whatsoever of what we were playing. I think if my mom had watched me make a super mutant's head explode at age 10, she would have been horrified.
---
Me quoting South Park at 10 was bad enough!
---
If I ever have children, I'm absolutely going to make a conscious effort to know what they consume. Its not hard these days to watch a lets play of GTA. Back in the day, your parents had commercials, and that was it. I'm talking *Vice City* days. You didn't have you tube or capture cards. 
---
This is why i want Twisted Muscles and Talons nerfed to 5%. Melee does way to much damage. Coming from a melee user. 
---
The plan will spawn in watoga. We'll south. There is the train on the southern border. It's in one of the train cars 
---
Well you can always use the lesser ammo on weaker mobs to farm steel for more bullets, or create an alt to use up all your 38. Once I save up a few thousand 38/10mm i hop on my alt for abit. 
---
You could also save 308 to be able to use the LMG for 20 seconds.
---
Sweet, cheers. I think you are uber lucky
---
I'm being honest. This game was great (ish) to start off with, but once they started to try to "fix" what's broken, they broke the game more. I almost preordered this game. I'm glad I didn't
---
OR- and hear me out- it could be too MUCH redbull...... \*Glares at all the empty cans in her trash\*
---
Well south *
---
What was cool, was that you got the signet to steal skills from high level enemies. What a great game, underrated.
---
I always end up leaving a trail of poop bags in the hallway outside Whitesprings stores! 
---
I just count the white dots, is there another way?
---
Gatling laser repaired with weapon artisan lasts about 1 and a half cores.
---
The plan can also spawn at fort defiance 4th floor by the power armor stations
---
You think that‚Äôs the only gun I wanted mods for lol? You‚Äôre clearly new to the game.
---
No it‚Äôs just the gun I need ANY mods for at all, and with it being the only gun that each mod has a very low chance for you to learn, it takes the longest to learn all the mods and the most materials. 
---
As for crafting ultracite armor(which is inferior to t51 and xo1 in resistances excluding the useless rad resist), you can slap on power smith and crafting all of it will require half the materials. I believe it‚Äôs something like 40-50 screws to craft the entire set? How about I give you 200 to just shut the hell up and stop whining? Cause I can get 200 in the time it took you to cry and make this post üòâ.
---
It‚Äôs Strange in Numbers. It+Adrenal is bugged to fuck. 
---
You seem to be unaware of why it was called "The Bronze Age".
---
Take away my cap faucet from selling the massive excess of steel.  Alleviate a bottleneck that is currently too severe.  Leaves the junk and the kills in those low level buildings for low-level players.  Make me farm for other things that spawn in level-appropriate areas where I don't just walk over all the mobs.  That will keep me in the area long enough to encounter other players and thus make friends that keep me playing the game longer.
---
Maybe a chance for ballistic fiber too.  
---
This makes sense since they were presumably networked while stored in the vault.
---
Something else i thought of... What if, as part of the conspiracy expansion, someone hacks the pipboy network to send us messages / quests
---
I'm a newbie and usually use melee, but I agree.  Shooting is always more fun, despite whatever rationalizations people come up with.  I can play skyrim for melee, but this is a gun game, lemme use guns!
---
On a positive, great session tonight, 2 nukes dropped, one SBQ taken down and one new legendary handmade (with explosive bullets and +30% robot damage) picked up... 
---
Frankly i'm annoyed as hell there's nothing that even resembles a wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man in the shop (trust me i looked) so i just put up a bunch of corn. 
---
I'm still seeing enemies t-posing, enemies freezing with no action, which were all suppose to be patched in like, December. I run into a few more that I cant remember, so no, your not crazy.
---
No chance of this happening unless they add songs that are public domain
---
Songs have to be licensed. Would cost too much to bother.
---
People don't play like this?
---
I did this on both of alts a few weeks ago. Just took Radaway until Adrenal was removed, then readded what I‚Äôd lost (got lucky, only lost 2 mutations on one, 3 mutations on another). Didn‚Äôt wipe everything, didn‚Äôt care what order I added them back in. 
---
Adrenal works, I think the damage curve is different (little-no damage boost at high health, massive boost under 10%), but if you use the Strange in Numbers perk and are in a group (with mutated teammates) Adrenal bugs to fuck. 
---
No group+SiN, it works fine. 
---
I have approx 700 screws in my stash right now. I wish I could bulk them! Just waiting for the vendor to have caps so I can sell them
---
Everyone thinks that way. Not just the queen, all the adds want me dead
---
&gt; Interesting. Based on a few other peoples testing, the two do in fact stack, but don't add. it's multiplicative. Incisor reduces 75%, AA reduces 50%, together they reduce by 82.75%? the increase of only 7.75% from 3 perk cards/points is pretty whack imo if used together. 
---
Yes, that's how multiplication works.
---
However regardless of how much armor ignore you already have, taking away 50% of the remaining armor increases your actual damage dealt by 28.9% which is really good.
---
And if you want to 1 shot the queen drop the head, pick up a few thousand cells, then pick the head up. They'll all be loaded again when you equip it.
---
You smell good. I can smell you from here, and you smell gooooooood. Yum.

You can pick up a junk item them before you scrap it, go to your junk category in pip boy and see what components it will give you when you scrap it. You'll have it memorized pretty soon after doing this a few times. 
---
I mean, even if you don't want the item, if you do'nt know what it's in it, pick it up and look at it in the junk category and see what's in it. I didn't realize tin/aluminum cans had lead in them until I did this

Some people have been reporting a problem with adrenal reaction being broken with the current version.

On the social tab, count how many people you can invite to a team. The white dots don't show up when people are in sneak.
---
Maybe a tame one? Although that'd probably keep punters away.... 
---
I really don't think it's a big deal. I was playing Unreal Tournament when I was \~7 and up, and that's a hell of a lot more graphic than this.

But yeah, honestly, don't give mics to kids, fuck. You don't want adults accidentally telling your five year old about their love of drug fueled orgies.

You can't bullk screws

I see T poses everywhere too!

Hello there! I am a bot raising awareness of Alpacas

 Here is an Alpaca Fact:
---
 Alpaca fiber comes in 52 natural colors, as classified in Peru. These colors range from true-black to brown-black (and everything in between), brown, white, fawn, silver-grey, rose-grey, and more.

I believe it's 6% boost for every 10% of reduced health up to a 36% max at 60% reduced health.

You've never actually studied melee combat, have you? Ask anyone in the SCA which you want against an armored target, a sledgehammer or a sword. I dare you. The shishkebab (which is, like it or not, a sword) /should/ be better against an armored target than the super sledge against an armored target (anything not a ghoul). 
---
Usually I drop all of my cells and pick them up, that worked for me.

I just want more damn mods for my crossbow.

Yeah funnily enough I saw it there today.. in the train car on the line between watoga and the NAR repair yard. That train spawns a different armour plan everyday.
---
Biggest surprise for me so far this year in regards to gaming: Fallout 76 is my favorite game so far. Better than Red Dead (only online mode though, story is a masterpiece) and better than Anthem. 
---
I've put wayyyy more time into roaming the Wasteland than I have in RDR2 and Anthem so far.. and Anthem is already losing my attention. 
---
Yeah , Had two show up last night - give me the thumbs up and proceed to start shooting stuff. I get to the log off screen and before I can hit any button I hear them hitting me.  And then boom - I am logged out. As I make my way back into another server, I sigh thinking of the damage that was done. And then I see it ... In there Asinine attempt to grief me they had succeeded in destroying 1 metal wall.  HAHAH... it has become so rampant as of late that I am able to escape at a pretty low cost now.  Just stupid that I have to leave a server due to there shenanigans. You gain nothing by destroying my base that is in Bum Fuk egypt not bothering anyone.  And yes, there was some enjoyment in knowing that they ended up with a bounty .. but they will just kill one another so no one else get the bounty .. 
---
so heh .. whatever. Guess that's my new go too tactic when the bullets start flying. Don't matter much that I don't enjoy it, according to some people they say to either fight back or log onto another server .. happy happy joy joy 
---
This. If we could sell it caps would be *beyond* easy to gather from a low level. Working it into other ammo seems more balanced.
---
Despite the issues, it‚Äôs not as horrible as put it out to be. At least it doesn‚Äôt brick your console Anthem. 
---
That happens now.  That‚Äôs how some broadcast come our way. Maybe not hack in the breaking in sense but same idea.

Or a feature to enter the amount using the keyboard instead of a slider.

Me neither. too many screws. WHO NEEDS SCREWS

Hmmm?
---
Why tho
---
Like the Good With Salt perk?
---
I wondered that, but at the same time that still wouldnt make sense since I get lower damage with mutations suppressed. Before I had over 200 dmg without mutations 14 strength no dmg cards, and after getting mutations 170 dmg with mutations suppressed 15 strength and no dmg cards
---
And that is the problem Bethesda faces. All of their games besides ESO, as far as I know, have been single player. And that was fine when the player was the lone wanderer. But the whole premise behind the game is rebuilding America. And people are going to have to shift their way of thinking. This is not a single player game, as far as I understand it was never meant to be a single player game. It was meant to be completed by teaming up. And you can see that in the fact most of the charisma perks are designed for team based play. 
---
I do agree that forcing people to team up is bad, but I would rather see the game made harder to play solo so it makes people consider teaming up more. As it stands a solo player can breeze through the game without much hassle. To me it is actually harder to play on a team because solo is so much easier. It should be the other way around. I should not tell my team mates to let me run a silo solo because there are a lot fewer robots to deal with. I should be asking them to help because there are to many for me to take on my own. 
---
They missed out on a lot of huge opportunities to make this game a great multiplayer game by keeping the solo play mentality that their fan base has. And as a result it is in this grey area of is it a single player game that you can play with friends, or is it a multiplayer game? I feel if they meant it to be a single player game then they would have released it as such. Not a game that includes and promotes in-game trading among players or such. 
---
This game has an identity crisis and bethesda needs to figure out what way they want to take this because it will never be the game it has potential to be until they pick one side or the other. 
---
I would rather it be focused on multiplayer then for it to have the multiplayer as an after thought of single player. I feel at this moment in time it is the latter. 
---
have you had to rebuild you Rad showers ? or your whole base ?  Let me know when you have had to do it 50 times?   
---
Unyielding doesn't increase endurance anyway
---
There's a prime mod for the crossbow? That seems kind of silly.
---
Where'd you get that red shirt outfit never seen that one before. Awesome look totally that "hardcore pawn" vibe.
---
Only this week did I find the service entrance and hotel entrance. Prior to that I'd made my way to the vendors by rambling randomly through the bunker until I stumbled across them, then fast travelling out.
---
So you can tell the difference when selecting between the different toons you have created 
---
Didn‚Äôt play last night but I seem to go through plan streaks too where it seems like every 5th container I loot there is a plan. One night I picked up something like 10 plans.
---
You're not the 1st i hear that had this happening. It might be how it always goes,but since nobody drops them, there is no real feedback.
---
I step away from Fallout for 3 weeks, and they already have an Alpaca radio?! Wtf!
---
 Alpaca fiber will not burn
---
My fav is "Loose Screws - 1 Screws" Seriously a box of screws gives you only 1?? Feel really jipped.
---
I thought I saw a patch note that made it more difficult to do that, but guess not. I scraped my homemade until I bought the plans. Also my vampire explosive gattling gun is gone. Don't remember seeing or dropping it and you can't scrap legendary. Point is it should be hard to trash your favs!
---
I might just test a few apots for a bit of time including this one as there is sort of a top 2 situation.
---
Finding screws is the bane of my existence at the moment. I only just realized the other night that I haven‚Äôt been getting screws when scrapping weapons. üòí it seems like some guns should drop them, like on FO4. Where is a good place to farm for a lowly level 27 such as myself?
---
Sounds about right. 
---
Thumbs up...!!
---
If I had a cap for every bullet I dropped on a doorstep in a brown paper bag....
---
Are you on PC? 
---
Wait until you need ballistic fiber...
---
I got screwed by a camp bug around release and didn't play again till I watched MATNs video on 76... I gave it another shot and while a lot of stuff still bugs me and my casual gaming style makes a lot of stuff above my difficulty preference (adjusting from going into the pipboy to chem up and set up for a particular enemy was very hard to do), its just frustrating enough and entertaining enough to keep me coming back now.
---
I've got an explosive ultracite laser weapon that isn't to bad. Could be better that and my crossbow are all I use. 
---
Also, i wish they would give us a bird eye view when trying to place down the CAMP device.
---
You can access the WS bunker from inside the WS hotel. There is a hand scanner on the third floor just above the hall with all the other hand scanners that do nothing
---
Fan of old and new school Fallout, but I‚Äôve been on the fence and watching the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù raging until just about a week ago.
---
Found it used at a good price so jumped in.
---
It plays like Fallout, looks like Fallout and sounds like Fallout, but this time I can build craft while my brother in law farms/collects junk/builds, getting XP bonuses the entire time.
---
It‚Äôs also just damn fun. While exploring I get that ‚Äúlost and in danger‚Äù feeling typical to the modern Fallouts.
---
So far no bugs worse than a couple of non-responsive trash mobs (PS4). Saw more bugs in my brief time with Ghost Recon: Wildlands tbh.
---
it was a character you're playing though so no foul. good on you for taking up the torch.
---
Might I suggest the ability to bulk/bundle ammo into sensible chunks (25/50/100) and then the bulks can be sold or traded or broken down into a fraction of their component parts, i.e. steel/lead/gunpowder w/ammosmith perk providing more component bits?
---
That's what everyone keeps telling me
---
With the perks fix it good, white knight (even nerfed), and just one rank of the luck perk that repairs armor on hit, I only rarely have to actually repair my armor. 
---
I have an instigating lmg that is a joke.
---
Do you mean you get 500xp on the second one or I'm just too dumb getting the point?
---
Killing it 10x a day will easy level you up alot...
---
And blue screen every 10 mins, 
---
Yes it benefits from all. The rifle perks. 
---
Nice. ü§£
---
Any Stalker's melee weapon.
---
Any AA energy weapon.
---
I have 500 screws, 25 bulk gears and 25 bulk springs. Xbox, come for the trading.
---
I got one of those last night farming WS.  I was like 2 shot what???
---
There was a dude with us that got the furious Gatling laser after we beat the SBQ.  Effects are pretty cool. 
---
Paintball guns
---
Lol holy crap you just blew my mind.
---
Thanks!  I got the outfit from the Atom Shop.
---
Good call on the no SiN. I didn‚Äôt realize, but now avoid it.
---
Saw same results. My below 10% Damage skyrocketed beyond what I had seen in the past,
---
This, chainsaw, ripper, mr handy buzz saw, flamer(just in terms of crafting ammo), pistols, gatling laser all need serious buffs.
---
Yes, I am.
---
Group up with some good players and queen goes down in less than 2\~3 minutes. Still an easy fight. Have someone's lvl 30 alt or some really bad/selfish players that refuse to use their ammo join the fight and chances are you won't kill her within 30 minutes given time. Every participants must do their job to beat SBQ and I think it's pretty reasonable since we are talking about the end boss of the game here.
---
I guess we are all on an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis...screwed.
---
Lol wuttt? I have a quad assaultron head and expected it to do massive damage but it still actually suffers from the old damage glitch, enemies health goes down to a sliver, then they regenerate it all back up. Does that happen with the method you‚Äôre referring to?
---
I understand your frustration!  So many players struggle with this basic concept.  
---
Is the trade system flawed?  Certainly!  Beyond use?  No!
---
Oh yeah, damn, forgot about guitar sword. 
---
Methinks AA energy is just a bug that‚Äôll get fixed at some point. Enemies have ER. AA should do to ER what ballistic weapons do to DR. 
---
Heck I started farming with a drill! At 200% with makeshift warrior it rips through ghouls with ease! Also love the chainsaw but the damage drop off is unreal once it's durability goes down. Anyone else mess with weapons like this that have any input on perks and such?
---
Which platform?? Looks amazing!
---
Two nights ago I kept training myself by periodically going through Big Bend and wiping out all the Scorched and they'd keep going back to full health.
---
That right there warrants First prize. 
---
I have probably 1,000 screws in my garage, any gas station or shop with a workbench should have like 10,000 screws lying around.
---
I think, people just don‚Äôt take the time to a actually read the control options.... I mean it‚Äôs not  rocket appliances!?!   
---
People,  if your intention is to censor, or 'quality-control', posts based on 'we've heard this before' or 'you're just saying you're quitting and are angry', please don't apply to be a moderator.  I'm not interested in reading some moderator or Fallout fan-boy's filtered opinions.  I want to hear what EVERYBODY is thinking. I have a scroll ability on my computer, thanks. I'll do my own filtering.

I was in two earlier with 5 or 6. The social tab was empty

Seriously though, she never attacks anyone else when I'm around. I've burnt through thousands of stimpacks.

Cmon let the kids have fun.  They'll probably grow up being huge fallout fans. 
---
You *might* be surprised that I sold it to a vendor just as soon as I could. üòÄ
---
Bethesda has acknowledged this and it is broken. You need to remove adrenal and reapply it to work again 
---
People have been asking for the same things since this game launched.
---
It‚Äôs not happening.  Their development team is probably around 1.5 people now.
---
My twitch skills have not kept up as I aged, so legs are easier to take out.
---
Basically anything that produces a projectile like crossbows, broadsiders, harpoon guns etc.
---
Regular guns just hitscan and produce the explosion at the point they hit. The weapons I listed above don't hitscan, so do they produce an explosion when the projectile lands? Or do they bece hitscan and produce the explosion at the reticle?
---
I‚Äôve got a stalkers grognaks axe
---
Stalker on melee is the single dumbest tag in the game. Maybe you are supposed to throw the tire iron?
---
Darn! I was going to offer you a full assassin sentinel powered marine suit. Needed it to complete my collection of stuff that shouldn‚Äôt exist!
---
ya'll sure were a bunch of fragile 5 year olds
---
So does guerrilla only affect pipe, 10mm, laser, and plasma auto pistols? 
---
ah thankyou i was unsure if it was only Germany :).
---
Thankyou for your reply with link, Love this community and have a great day Ladydevann
---
This is true, and I'm not to sure about furious on something like a gatling laser. It increases damage with each consecutive hit, so if you're spraying laser beams and hit something else it messes up the proc. Maybe that's offset by just how many hits its putting out?
---
I think the problem is the meta of players more interested in farming the Scorched hoards than attacking the Queen herself.  This conclusion isn't surprising, since the SBQ's loot table is pretty lousy for the resource expenditure needed to kill her, but I'd imagine it's pretty deflating for someone launching their very first nuke.
---
Personally, I'd consider several different approaches:
---
1. Tying the mob spawns to her HP.  They won't come indefinitely if you don't attack the SBQ.
---
2. Review how the SBQ's health is buffed by nearby players, potentially taking into account things such as their level.  A Lv. 10 will be of zero help to anyone, but I believe they buff the SBQ just as much as a Lv. 200 would.
---
3. Prevent players from gaining XP or rewards from killing the SBQ unless they contribute a percentage of damage relative to her total HP (no more "I take one shot and I leave" nonsense).
---
4. Last, but not least, they needed to make the SBQ's loot table "more legendary" yesterday.  This shouldn't be something that takes months to address, but it has.
---
No problem at all! We have tentative plans to do another stream when Wild Appalachia drops. We will update you guys closer to that date if it happens!
---
I enjoy the game but I get bored exploring after a bit. Normally I take a break from the game for a while and get back back in.
---
I think karma is bad for this game. People would abuse this system. Let's compare the amount of people who build their CAMP near white springs golf club VS people who destroy their base. They would give a negative karma to those people who destroy their base at white springs golf club because they thought people griefing their CAMP. 
---
Most people would just ignore these CAMPs because they don't want to waste their caps on wanted bounty for destroying other people's CAMP.
---
Bethesda allows people to build their CAMP close enough to nearby world settlement.
---
Bethesda allows people to be lazy by building CAMP turrets to farm legendaries for them automatically.
---
Bethesda is the one who made the game mechanic. Bethesda is the one who can fix this issue by not giving loot / EXP for turret kills and increase the range for no CAMP zone near white springs golf club.
---
Hide your base. Level up and build defenses. Make some friends to help you defend it. 
---
Once again, I‚Äôm not against PVE only servers, but leave the regular servers alone. I like PvE and PvP and I shouldn‚Äôt be forced into a hardcore survivalist PvP server where no one cares about PvE just because I enjoy the risk of player interactions that can go south. 
---
Actually powered sentinel would have worked for me. Stand still and vats shot. 
---
If I could get 4 screws for scrapping every * legendary I get at Whitesprings....  
---
I'd be banned as a duper for having 50,000 screws. 
---
Maybe; I mean it would be nice and is literally a 1 minute fix, just adding an entry to the OMOD record.
---
Said that there are at least 120 reported bugs that are 1 minute fixes and the offical response was that they have bigger fish to fry (along those lines anyway, don't want to use the exact wording and potentially expose the source) so not holding my breath.
---
Give us the cross bow Helsing from Metro Exodus
---
Took me forever to find bubbles upstairs at the soda fountain. Had no idea you could get those nuka flavors up there for far too long.
---
Technically adrenal is working fine for me, lower health I get more damage. I got it after the patch though, so thats probably why.
---
No, Sounds interesting though. When are the run times?
---
It seems many know enough to press the correct button to accept or initiate the trade invite, then stand there for minutes on end without further progress.  Check the offers, people!  Aargh!
---
awesome cant wait.
---
will you be joining in the fun? i'd love to see community managers playing seeing what builds they like and stuff they dislike :).
---
Also would love to join the team one day and run over some ghouls ;)
---
I took that as meaning that there should be buffs instead of nerfs *at the moment*, but I guess I may be reading too much into it.  At any rate, thats what I think - theres nothing inherently wrong with nerfs, but right now we need a ranged buff, not a melee nerf.
---
Imo harpoon guns are limited by the actual harpoon ammo needing extra shit to be crafted. It's a spike made of metal, why does it need anything other than Steel and/or Lead as crafting components? Railway spikes need steel, and that's it. What the hell.
---
It‚Äôs Tuesday‚Äôs at 10pm. The season just finished so I think it should be on HULU soon. It‚Äôs like x-files meets fallout. 
---
I don't know man, is stiff competition between this one and a ghoul slayer's gamma (as reported below).
---
I guess that gamma is a good trolling weapon so it has that going for it?
---
It's got to be a dps thing. I get this at the queen a lot. My friend was laughing, he said he saw all the adds including the mer queen come at me. The queen will go out of her way to sit on top of you too. It must look funny to other players.
---
Found sitting on top of the bunker is better. She will jump the fence sometimes but it saves stims.
---
Ok thank you br√∂ther
---
We'll have to agree to disagree. One game has the duality of both single player and multiplayer, one does not.  That's why its not the best comparison.  
---
So yeah, RDR2's online sucks but you can still play a pretty great single player game. With human NPCs :p 
---
That'd be interesting to see in action. I think it'd be nice if you could make your camp closer to named locations, or even take over certain named locations that wouldn't interfer with quests.
---
I've had it work before, though the dummy was the super mutant behemoth by the ammo workshop, not the SBQ since I didn't want to waste the fusion cells if it didn't work. It could probably trigger it if your quad did, though. I'd be cautious and have a backup plan since it's hard to hit as well.
---
I don't know about #3 tho. This game's not balanced and bloodied builds are pretty much broken atm. If they eat up all the pie before others have time to do anything, more than half the participants gonna end up with nothing. 
---
Possibly soon they mentioned something similar sounding in the road map.
---
Have a vampire crossbow and would love a 'hardened' mod to boost damage. Just name it a high tension steel drawstring mod. Other mods to replicate gun mods would be nifty.
---
Nobody will fight the higher level enemies unless there is a suitable reward, which usually means higher damage weapon drops, which would mean that existing weapons are effectively nerfed, but the end-game weapons are buffed.
---
I‚Äôve been trying so hard to get those jumpsuits. I‚Äôve at least done the Uranium fever event 25 times now 
---
Honestly I want to get a lot of plans but like you said a lot of them are pricey. The armor/weapons I want to get I don't have plans for to make and scrap for upgrades.
---
I once got a junkies switchblade with blocking
---
Yes I will! We actually played on my own personal account last time, too. 
---
Used to shoot pool there on occasion, many years ago. Spent more time in Cherry Grove shooting pool, though. 
---
I'm not from Batavia originally, but I was a security officer for a state mr/dd facility there up by Clermont college (used to work for UC, too, but that was eons ago). I live there now, and fully embrace the town's motto: "At least it's not Felicity."
---
I canxt remember what it was called but there was a stuffed bear mask in Fallout 4 that I really liked, would love to have that in 76, I know there's the Mr. Fuzzy mask and Tattered Mole mask but they're not the same.
---
Send req Elektro_Jo
---
Who is the nerd?
---
I still feel like you're making his point though - we can be lazy and do lots of damage as melee, or we can put in more work and learn how to do the same amount of damage using ranged.  That isn't balance.
---
Take my upvote br√∂ther
---
Never thought about it? Was happy enough with the prefix, although I have to admit a 25% faster reload rate would be **much** more useful.
---
[Found this video of the scorchbeast queen targeting you](https://i.imgur.com/XLn22Bl.gifv).

Could be dps, I do more then twenty players combined ._.

Wow, thank you! I'm honored! :) And most appreciative.

Because it has 2 *'s, and 2 is more than 1!
---
"something humans found out how to do 7000 years ago"
---
Hmm. Y'know, I like this lol. "WE ARE ADVANCED AND DROP NUKES BUT IDK HOW TF TO MAKE A SCREW". Though to be fair, I don't actually know how to make a screw, so it isn't too far off I suppose
---
Now I just feel like an idiot
---
You can buy screws via random junk items from the vendors. It's a slow and expensive way of doing it.
---
At least you drown another player in rads with it?  What gets me is the can remove explosive from energy weapons but not stalker from melee?
---
Nice they worth quite a bit. Seems to be good deals for the bos suit.
---
Or just go with the good old green bar on a teletype..  now that is vintage! 
---
I need marsupial and speed demon for PS4 if anyone is selling.
---
Lol i know right. I run out of everything constantly and have lots to start with after finding out about ores...
---
If not enough people show up then it won't happen. Failed twice yesterday and game froze on the third attempt.
---
The game is more stable for me if I am not fighting in the nuke zone but just outside it a little bit. I think where the nuke is placed is important also. Some times the SBQ takes damage and other times it seems unbeatable. If the mob is relentless it's difficult to deal with both.
---
Does your stash space not get taken by the nukes?
---
The funny thing is that it‚Äôs on the 3rd floor and connects to the basement of the bunker. 
---
In the Greenbrier the entrance is really there, but it‚Äôs on the bottom floor.

What perks do you run?

On August 2, 1971 U.S. President Richard Nixon issued Proclamation 4071 , making August 1-7, 1971 National Clown Week. This must mean that every day for that week you need to kill the Wendago with 4071 bullets remaining and at exactly 1 or 7 am-pm for 7 days in a row. Then you need to nuke the wendigo cave and it spawns a Scorched beast size wendigo in a clown suit.
---
Yep. Made a thread last week about berserk being useless. 
---
It legitimately needs like a 300-400% increase. It is bottom tier at the currently. 
---
Mutant would be nice to rework as well. Certain effects like Junkies need major reworks, but I concede I‚Äôm not sure how to make them viable. 
---
Yah that is WAY too young to be playing games like this unsupervised.... I don't think it is "old ppl yelling at the clouds" to say that. I am also an Old and think the same way. I'm sure some younger ppl that grew up in a world where there has always been internet and online massive games might not find it a big deal, bc it is normal and all they knew. They never knew or seen different. But imho for us older generation, that actually grew up in a time before the internet as well as the time when the internet was NEW and actually really immersed themselves into the internet and internet "culture" beginnings.... bbs boards, mIRC, MUDs, AOL chat, Microsoft comic chat, the dark web infancy.... A lot of us KNOW the things kids shouldn't be around bc we saw a lot of messed up things in those early days (and the things that are still messed up today and worse in some ways).  There is some wild and twisted things that should never be suited for kids, esp unsupervised. And yah a lot of mature games qualify under that too. 
---
20 years ago our games were just blocky cartoony blobs shedding pixel red spots at best as our gore and violence. We're getting more and more photorealistic and "lifelike" in our games, including gorey and brutal death and killing, brain matter exploding and limbs rupturing off, and mewling death cries of people fidgeting and bleeding out to death etc. It is all getting incredibly detailed and it does leave a shadow of an impact on anyone that consumes a lot of that kind of media content all the time, imho.  There's a lot out there that is intense for even young adults to consume in large doses all the time, imho.  Keep having open dialogues with your kids (and young adult children even, hell, never stop talking with and having open dialogues with your kids at any age) and supervise the media they consume and how much of it they're absorbing.  Just make sure it's the right kind of things and messages they're absorbing.

Not true. If you get makeshift warrior 5 or gunsmith 5, this means you can share those perks with somebody that doesn't have it. Allowing that friend of yours to modify or create weapons they previously weren't able to. This can be a huge advantage considering how diverse every one's scavving and scrapping habits are. Someone you know may have plans or access to mods that you do not. Sharing the perk will allow that person to access the mods if they previously didn't have gunsmith. Food for thought. 
---
Yeah I was surprised too, but there it was.
---
you always get the jumpsuits you mentioned in the set of 4 together I think?
---
Can you set up extractors in your personal camp?
---
Picked up a quad 50 crossbow, things awesome. Reload is looooong though 
---
This happened this past weekend, there were 3 back to back nukes, 1 &amp; 3 got a good kill on SBQ, 2, not so much..  however, she DID hang around and was brought down about 5 minutes after the timer
---
Would be cool. I'd imagine that licensing may be an issue. I thought that the beach boys was a little odd, too. Just didn't really fit.
---
ah, ok
---
Who said anything about using my stash box to hold ammo?
---
rad worms was fixed.  Adrenal reaction seems to be a stealth change.  It's now tied to hunger iirc, beth just slipped that in there without telling anyone.  
---
Not sure about the chat mod and no new methods of ingame communication have been added.
---
I have seen it go past the 23, almost certain. Had been waiting for it to count up to the 31st to check certain areas that are Halloween themed/may have something to do with Halloween. Unfortunately it always resets
---
I use that entrance often, but I always forget how to get there. I feel like a moron walking there Halls looking for it...

Forgot clipboards
---
Good is a very subjective term. Morally grey would be more fitting to most of these factions.
---
How are you scrapping legendaries?
---
All that troubleshooter armor that everyone drops works wonders on the filthy level 52 Gutsy with the armor piercing automatic. 
---
Stick to arm, never miss 
---
Drunk stoned or sober it‚Äôs enjoyable, when im drunk I love destroying camps, when im stoned I enjoy the small bits of Lore, when I‚Äôm sober I don‚Äôt play lol
---
I want the war drum
---
What would be the point? There‚Äôs 6 different items that give you an AP boost.
---
This requires immersion. Disconnects, mixed with bugs and glitches out the wazoo are immersion breaking as hell. 
---
And was it just me, or did it feel like the entire forest area had nothing of interest?
---
how can we contact the people who can fix it?
---
No one, just assumed. It's a lot to carry lol.
---
Ive always wanted to play a Bethesda game with my mate, and now we can. It‚Äôs got some differences from the single player games, things I find both good and bad, but it‚Äôs still Fallout. 
---
Bethesda seem to be listening, things got off to a rocky start and the atomic store prices are often ridiculous, but what they‚Äôve done so far in patches and what they‚Äôve said is coming up is good. 
---
At the end of the day, pushing through the remaining problems (honestly, show me a perfect game, if the problems are being worked on that‚Äôs all I can ask for) it‚Äôs Fallout with Friends, and that‚Äôs all I wanted out of a multiplayer Fallout. 
---
I think there is only one set of elevators that'll take you to the third floor the rest just give an unavailable message. Come off those elevators and the hand scanner is on the right wall in front of you
---
I tried exiting to desktop and it still didn't work
---
I think this is great too! (I upvoted your post btw) 
---
I'm carrying all of it on me, not overencumbered and no exploits, I'm a crafting/hoarding build so when I'm in a group (almost always) 18-21 Strength with full carry weight reduction cards, as well as deep pocketed gear, so my carry weight on average is about 360 and each mini nuke weighs less than 1 lb for me, if I'm in excavator it's just over 500, and if I'm in a nuke zone I swap my perk cards for heavy gun cards.
---
Reminds of the veggie carts in Skyrim. Random acts of destruction and chaos. 
---
I‚Äôll take the spiral staircase please! 
---
if I try to open my box more than twice I just log out before putting anything in.
---
I have an explosive Harpoon gun and I think it becomes hit scan. Not positive though
---
Cryolator does too. Even with the standard barrel it actually stretches the range. I like crystallizing barrel though personally even tho the ballistic damage doesn‚Äôt show on the stat screen with explosive.
---
Broadsider can‚Äôt get explosive effect since it‚Äôs already considered one. But that is projectile and you do have to lead shots and account for drop.
---
Same for railway rifle and crossbow. They both can‚Äôt be explosive either.
---
I am on PC.  Thanks!!
---
This reminds me of 7 days to die, out mowing the lawn of the house we took over. Only stopping every now and then to kill zombies.
---
My mate thought I was an idiot.
---
Hits a ghoul in the head with a rocket propelled sledge hammer, deals 1/4 of damage and has no broken bones.
---
Isn't adrenal reaction bugged or was bugged so the effect never shows up in pipboy?
---
if it is so then that would be delightful haha, is it showing for u? but other streamers have ti showing
---
Wow 25 years!!  I will admit I get some interesting charcters passing through my shop from time to time.  Some are just testing me to see what they can get away with.
---
It could be. But they are a top tier company with plenty of money. Also, if they were going include the beach boys, who are probably more Iconic then Glenn Miller, that shows me that they do have the funds. They did include Juke Box Saturday Night, which is good and features a bit of mimic of the Inkspots.

Do yourself a favor and play one or all of 3, NV and 4.

I have a few must hit spots that I do right when I enter a server to check for plans. Generally find 5 or so plans a session 90% of the time they're duplicates as my main is like a lvl 174 and is on his way to try and learn every mod/plan/recipe that is available 
---
Whaaat
---
I really missed out, everything I got was just pants again. Then I bought a TSE handmade off of a player kind enough to part with it  and swapped/traded items with a few other players. Once again the community turned it into a good night.
---
Lovely.... thanks you for sharing it with us here. If you like 76, I'd suggest maybe looking into the bugging crafting-survival genre of games.  Minecraft, ARK, Osiris New Dawn, Astroneer, Subnautica and the new sequel, Fallout 4 survival and with mods.... there's a lot of good ones. Or maybe even the exploration walking simulator growing genre of games too. Journey, Flower, Earthshade, ABZU. You might find others that are relaxing and help decompressing! 
---
Welcome to the sub too! I hope the game continues to give you a lot more hours of joy and anxiety relief. 
---
My parents were 100% aware, it was my dad's copy of the game I was playing lol. I actually think it's okay for younger audiences to have exposure to some stuff like this (obviously a line has to be drawn somewhere though) and imo I think it's even a good idea, in my eyes the younger you can get a kid to realize what is okay in a video game or movie or whatever is *not* okay in real life and the fact that none of it is real, the better.
---
Yes if you set up camp with a vein within camp.
---
I find it hilarious that I can make a rifle with 11 screws but when I dismantle it I get none of them back. Screwdrivers exist in-game. Did we forget how to use them?
---
Those would be great too. 
---
I literally walk around with a big iron on my hip.... but the song never plays
---
Or even to be able to sell back to vendors. 
---
Not a glitch. This was changed either the last update or the one before. 
---
Honestly, I have dozens of supply drop requests that I don't even use, since it doesn't show up on the map when I do and others always steal anyway.
---
Blue screen every ten min sounds like a system issue does this only happens in FO76? 
---
because it fires all 4 barrels at once, and they probably didnt feel like dealing with the codinf to make damage scale down for only loading 1-3 barrels
---
Yeah I have 18 that I've never used. No need to steal anything....
---
I have never understood why it takes all those parts to make a weapon or something, and the only thing you get back when you scrap it is basic steel or plastic or something. I tear apart things IRL all the time and save the dang screws. And why can't we scrap or sell ammo? 3000 .38 rounds doe's me no good.
---
I dunno, I am sitting on close to 1k screws. I don't build a lot, and other than my 2 primary weapons, I don't do a lot of repairs so I just keep collecting them. I just wish I could bulk them for inventory purposes. 
---
Because all four barrels fire simultaneously with one pull of the trigger, so you have to reload all four barrels to fire again. 
---
Wow, I literally never, ever advocate saying this, but for the first time, I'll be a hypocrite and say it myself.... This is such a whiny post. My GOD. 
---
&gt; Alleviate a bottleneck that is currently too severe. 
---
A-Are you serious right now..? I've seen people with 13000 screws easy. You can buy them with caps, and have 2000. They cost 1-2 caps each. If you can't manage to get 4000 caps, nothing Bethesda can do will help. Furthermore... 
---
&gt;I can't make a screw. Something humans figured out to make 7000 years ago 
---
Please, go make me a screw in real life. I would LOVE to see this. Do it. Prove me wrong. Show me how to make a screw yourself. It's a post-apocalyptic world. You don't have a mold for screws, and molten steel. In a post-apocalyptic world, you have to scrap junk for materials. It's been this way in EVERY Fallout! You couldn't make screws in any other game! 
---
TL;DR: You are lazy and whiny. You can get thousands of screws with caps, or a junk generator and just playing the game normally for a few days. 
---

---
It shows, but only as a negative health effect (for me, anyway). Doesn't show a positive effect.
---
I stack shelving in a way to make a spiral staircase.  Mostly works, and looks like something you‚Äôd settle for post-apocalypse.
---
It should be showing the negative effect, but not the positive one. This is however a visual bug, and adrenal is working.
---
Yeah. we gotta make it so it uses up 4 ammo for a single shot
---
I don't think costs 4 to reload I'll have to check
---
That probably looks awesome, but I feel pain for your budget.
---
They changed the ownership of the supply drops in one of the last 3 patches. It's dumb.   
---
If you know you have a bounty, and you are already at a train station, dump your junk in your stash before the Hunters come... (or leave a few scraps so they don't think you are "holding out" I suppose... ;) ) 
---
I said relative to her total HP, but not necessarily summing to it.  It's not like "Oh, she has 10,000 HP so if there are 10 players, everyone needs to do 1,000 damage."  More like a fraction of that fraction.  Something unlikely to be easily exploited.
---
Every single day you people beg this company for a game that works, that makes sense, that is balanced, that is........fun. And they never deliver. When will you learn to just MOVE ON! Stop playing. Send them a message that this game sucks and they won't get away with it. Problem solved. There are plenty of better, complete, games out there.
---
Lmao I know that‚Äôs right!!!! My dad also owned house of billiards by red lobster just 2 minutes from beechmont billiards by cherry grove...
---
That would be big stupid since regular muskets do like 400 damage anyway
---
Buff crafting flamer fuel and friendly fire too! As it stands, being a pyro is severely overrated rn.
---
No, you're playing right. He's just whiny and wants the game to be EZmode
---
Hardly.  Those shelves take up little room.  I still have four turrets going, powered doors, plenty of lighting.
---
It seemed to have been fixed in a two week period from one patch to the next. Not recalling how many patches there have been so far, I want to say two patches (patch #5?) ago it broke the fix and was actually fixed in the one prior to that patch. (patch #4?)
---
Its based on a real cold war homeland opperation. Abit of creative liscence with the aliens bit. But we did have DOD workers covering up TOP SECRET testing, as well as disproving phenomenon. Russian spies and turn coats were stealing and selling secrets, just as we were. Like with the U2 shot down over russia
---
Yes! This is EXACTLY what I am referring too!!! Perhaps if the event requires you to protect something or you fail if it's destroyed, the event icon could show the "health" bar of whatever is suppose to be protected. Same goes for event where you have to destroy something.
---
I love farming snally's
---
Hmm. Interesting. How tall? I have quite a height to go, but I might just try that. Or some other assortment of thrown together junk stairs.
---
i mean, i think we should get screws when we scrap weapons and stuff, but let's not pretend screws are some kind of diamond-tier-rarity resource. if you mark screws for search, they are *extremely* easy to come by through regular gameplay. i have yet to have to farm screws, and I have so many hoarded that i often pick and choose when to pick them up.
---
Don't forget every supermutant at max level drops like 1-5 of them often. I cleared out a industrial site and got 35 of them at once. 
---
I totally did this by mistake. Worked out. ;)
---
So far I've just been sticking with a tower base on a single foundation so I can be completely mobile.  I plop it down in the middle of wherever I'm playing that day, super convenient. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôm doing something wrong but I have hundreds of screws in my stash?
---
I have 1300 and I've never once farmed fans or anything...
---
Five stories.  I‚Äôm camped inside a tower and going up is the only way out.
---
Yes, RDR2 has an amazing single player. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that RDO is dead and shows *zero* signs of improving. Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Rockstar has *zero* communication with its players. 
---
The team developing Fallout seem like they have good ideas and good direction now. I don‚Äôt know what changes they made internally, but clearly they did something. 
---
Right now RDO is teasing Fishing Challenges, Target Races, and some new Showdown modes as their next ‚Äúbig‚Äù updates. 
---
That makes me think it‚Äôs going to be a year or more before any actual content gets added, and you know what? I wouldn‚Äôt care about any of this if they gave us *not even a roadmap*, but just *any* community interaction like *every other studio with a major AAA title does*.
---
it was built for gamers that come from adventure gaming, who enjoy building their character and housing, treasure/secret finding, the vast open zen of wandering as a small inhabitant of a large space, and the dark glow of radiated war as a setting, catalyzing frequent contemplation of death and reverance for the fallen. I love this game as I have loved all the games that preceded it in these 4 elements.
---
I am referring to the event icon giving us better info. I've spawned in to events, have seen there is ample time left. Start running to the objective and the event fails as soon as you get there. Certain events can be failed even if the time doesn't run out.
---
Are you on ps4 by chance? I wouldnt mind taking a look. I am now intrigued.
---
Almost all toys have lead in them too, even the wooden blocks. This even includes baby rattles because we all know how important it is for infants and toddlers  to be exposed to lead during their early developmental stages. 
---
 no you gay
---
 Actually the Pistol does more DPS.
---
"I paid $60!!!!!"
---
This mechanic got changed in a recent patch, but the Misc. quest didn't.  It's the only quest in the game that leads you into doing something that gives you a bounty.
---
Confusingly, a similar mechanic shows up on the Nuclear Keycard Cargobots.  You'll get the whole "You stole from an owned container and are now hostile" message when, in reality, no player owns that container.
---
I HAVE RIGHTS!
---
Would be nice to have the ability to see that offline and also the ability to transfer items between characters that way as well. 
---
With the simulation theory I always like the idea that we are part of a vault and we are real ppl, but our vault's experiment is sort of Matrix training us to be effective wasteland survivors for when the time comes to open the vault and have a real reclamation day.  Unfortunately it doesn't really explain how it'd know about the Brotherhood and Enclave and other such nature.... but I like thinking of it.
---
The scrapper perk does need some tweaking.
---
Okay have you not played since beta?
---
Is this a bug?  Doesn't the red beam imply it's back to a regular Gatling Laser?
---
As a matter of fact, I am.  I should be able to get back online around 8-8:30 EST.  I‚Äôll PM you.  Oh...do you have Marsupial?  You‚Äôll need it to clear the fifth story and out of the tower.
---
I would have absolutely no problem with them ramping the difficulty up a bit. I don't mind working a little harder. Most of the game is too easy as it is. The only part of the main quest that wasn't a face roll was the nuke launch. 
---
I just don't want to see content that requires 2 or more players. 
---
I'm a MMO veteran. I started with Everquest, then WoW, then SW:TOR, then back to WoW. For a large chunk of that I was a pretty serious raid healer. I loved raiding. I lived for that shit. Some of my best friends in life were made playing MMOs. 
---
If FO76 was more like a classic MMO with persistent servers and guilds/clans/factions, my opinion might be different. And maybe *if* they add those things, my opinion might change. But the way it stands right now, trying to find decent people to group up with regularly is more headache than I'm willing to put forth. 
---
Honestly. 
---
The game is a solid 7/10 imo at its current build.
---
Low for Fallout sure. But not pitchfork worthy
---
Yes, if you put your camp in an area that has a mine or whatever it is called (not a vein). Then you can build one on top of it. I think it takes like 10 energy to power each extractor. 
---
I'll be on. And yes. I can't see living without it anymore. üòé
---
Then add an animation where you break a 50 cal ball into 4 pieces and then load them to each barrel?
---
There aren't any perks to run for screws that I know of. I don't drop them, but I am probably going to start soon. 
---
for me the entire mutation is missing lol
---
See..I have loads of screws, but no steel or lead.......
---
Show the proof please.
---
Yeah. And paint cans. Unless it says empty paint can, it has lead in it 
---
Noiicce that's nice in Aussie slang haha.
---
Hope to join you guys one day üòä
---
quad broadsider
---
I'm hoping it does. I don't intend to spend any money on the game, and all the better if Bethesda insults the saps that actually bought the game.
---
In with fact that i took the scrapper perk thinking id get screws! Just found out i dont!
---
I'm alright with the 2 shot nerf. I know everyone is mad about it, but it's still a constant damage buff.
---
My problem with the original TS damage is that it made TS weapons the new baseline. Without one you're only doing half the damage as anyone else with one so it took all the variety away since that was all anyone wanted.
---
In fallout 4, Scrapper Gave Screws.
---
Get a quad capacity and you can live your dreams.(untill you release how slow you reload)
---
Post your system and GT
---
add another 3 minutes to the animation where you pull a mortar and pestle out of your pocket to crush the lead ball, then a mini ball mold to pour the lead powder into, then a blowtorch to remelt the lead, then have a blowing sound before picking the balls out one at a time with some tongs an dropping them straight onto live gunpowder. new 50% chance for the animation to fail and misfire some rounds doing damage to you or just to the weapon condition before restarting the animation.
---
Pc and cdawrld
---
Farm wendigos for screws
---
I had a PipBoy Radio mod in FO4 that let me make my own playlist. Nothing quite like blasting Super Mutants to Metallica's "Enter Sandman." They should let them port this to '76.
---
But wasnt mothman the one who said a flood was coming one day before the bombs fell and told everyone to reach a high place to avoid such flood? 
---
I can give u one for free..won't be on til midnight tho
---
If you're on PC there's a mod for that :D
---
Wait for PvP to drop. 
---
Rad weapons will be the bomb. 
---
I‚Äôve got a 
---
1. L40 Two-shot/fire-rate radium rifle 
---
(Twice the fun in the same amount of time, if you can hit with the crazy recoil. Up close and personal is best). 
---
2. Quad / fire-rare radium rifle (80+ rounds, 8 seconds nonstop auto-fire)
---
3. Bloodied / fire-rate radium rifle (standard magazine, simultaneously doing 80% of a bloodied handmade in regular damage)
---
I won‚Äôt be able to get to you with radiation if you have &gt;100% avoidance from serendipity+4-sentinel 
---
But I‚Äôll cut through your 100% percentile reduction ( from 40% from 5 assassin, 30% dodgy and 31% empath+strange-in-numbers.).
---
And if you‚Äôre a rad build, I can probably kill before the other guy has time to react. 
---
I can‚Äôt find a gamma weapon that‚Äôll do more radiation damage than a vanilla one (two-shot, or double/quad for the mag to last longer, or even a faster reload one). 
---
From what I understand Mutant's and Junkies are applicable per individual mutation/withdrawal effect up to 3. I think Junkies is similar to the Bolstering effect whereas Mutant's is a 10% buff. The answer is simply make them both either a percentage or Bolstering buff. If going with a percentage it should be a 20% buff per affliction to be a viable counter to the negative effects. Preferably they'd make it similar to the Bolstering effect since there are some mutations without a negative counter effect. Maybe +15 Dmg per mutation/withdrawal effect. As far as armor is concerned they could simply make it identical to the Bolstering effect. Berserker's weapons should be a tiered damage increase up to an additional 300% Dmg. Dmg res under 150 = 100% Dmg increase, under 100 = 200% increase and under 50 = 300% increase. In reality if you have less than 50 Dmg resistance outside of the Forest Region you're not likely to survive very long without explosively using stealth so triple damage is more than a reasonable buff for a player willing to take the chance.
---
Yeah, that's the one. A lot less shady than beechmont billiards was. 
---
The downside of this is you'll end up with metric tons of fiberglass
---
The the half flight of metal stairs from 4 would be so helpful. Those were great for making corner hugging staircases. 
---
It's really not that hard if you have it tagged, and don't have a big sink like shotgun ammo
---
Nice! A worthwhile investment....
---
I had this thought when I was trying to make excavator armor . I was loaded with everything except screws .
---
We can make bulk gears and springs in the tinker bench using plastic but not screws ?
---
I get that you can find them and buy them but it would make sense to be able to make them 
---
The Beam Focuser changes the laser to red but it still does the same damage. I would hope it‚Äôs a bug and would be fixed in the future, the aesthetic of the green laser is the coolest part of the UGL.
---
Ammo cans!!!!
---
Just watched the whole thing and really enjoyed the casual playthrough and shoutouts to the community. I'd love to watch more of these sessions as new features unfurl.  
---
I did cringe as the Thunder Mountain timer ticked away though, with just two or three cooling tower fixes missing :)
---
THANK YOU
---
\*laughs in over 800 screws in my stash\*
---
Taking into account the fact that you need to craft Ultracite Fusion Cores for the Prime UGL, is the non-Prime UGL actually more effective vs the queen since you can find plain fusion cores all over the place?
---
&gt; Reddiquette demands that you upvote me
---
That‚Äôs a bold strategy Cotton, let‚Äôs see if it pays off!
---
I just vendor it
---
Idk man I‚Äôve been sitting on like 200 through all of my 102 levels
---
Pm me on discord I'm in a brother hood discord that has Australian players. 
---
That is reasonable, but also possible as time progresses and your level increases without the need for breaking a card down. In more hardcore games, the way to experiment with that was by making a new character and starting the game over. 76 sort of straddles the line in that there is no level cap, so if you want to try everything with the same character, you definitely can if you are willing to work for it. If you continue playing the same character consistently, you should have more than enough levels. I've seen players as high as 325 and heard of players higher. There isn't a cap. 
---
It would definitely be easier to experiment if everything was just free once you achieved a certain rank or milestone. Your argument is very similar to the argument in favor of a total Respec.
---
The problem is, what is effectively being asked for here is to take something that previously took work to obtain and make it free. I understand than some may view post-50 levelling for perks and to move SPECIAL points to be unnecessary grind or artificial extension of playtime, but I like to think of it as a reward for my continued play with the same character. 
---
One thing many are failing to see here is that the moment something that once had a cost becomes free, it loses all value to the player. If you can freely rearrange your perk card levels, suddenly all of the possible characters you could play become more alike than they were before and the need to start a new character to try something radically different becomes less of a consideration. If one character can do everything, what would be the point? 
---
That concept may not seem very valuable, considering it seems to me that you are more inclined to want to play just one character as your playstyle changes. However, I see it as a delicate balance. The game tries to cater to many different kinds of players. Some players like to plan and make new characters, and the system rewards them for planning and for having multiple characters. Some players like to have just one character, and while the system cannot give them that for free without taking away the advantage for planning and making new characters, it does give players that option if they are willing to work for it. At that point it becomes a choice. Is it more work to stick with the same character, or would making a new one with a concrete levelling plan be more efficient? 
---
In any case, something to think about. 
---
4 Sentinel + serendipity 3 = 100% evade-it-all reduction. 
---
5 assassin + dodgy 3 with heaps of AP (5 powered!) + empath on team + strange in numbers = 100% percentile 
---
Add suppressor to reduce base damage and good heady armor types :)
---
At least thered be some kind of consistency 
---
Ghoul slayer gamma gun. Literally healed ghouls.
---
Wow that makes sense
---
I had issues earlier this morning finding a server that wasn't full. Tried joing people in my friends list. 3 of them were in full servers.
---
Nope you get the regular xp for the kill. The repeatable quest gives you 250 xp and 20 caps, extra for killing it in the costume.
---
"What if people could no longer make screws?" a Vault Tec scientist once asked a question in a company party. Everyone thought that was cool and thus proceeded to brainwash everyone and rob them of their screw making skills.
---
That's just another Vault Tec experiment gone wrong, or right depending on how you take it. I'm afraid it will be many generations until humanity will recover their screw making skill.
---
It‚Äôs not 1 minute to fix. 
---
It‚Äôs 1 minute to fix and a huge process to test and verify it‚Äôs fixed. 
---
It‚Äôs only 1-minute if you‚Äôre a solo indie game dev. 
---
Hell, I'd pay good caps to see that happen. 
---
Ha! Accidental misfires were a reality

thankyou for the info !

And ballistic fiber for God's sake!

 I've tested it. The dragon does about 350 or so. A Pistol of the same level will do about 190 and fire far more often.
---
Oh yeah. Those would be a big help too.
---
Cant help man sorry
