An empty pool table looks dumb af.

---
Did the same with my contoller via Bluetooth (like to play in bed :-)..... have to use cable now.
---
If you equip every piece of the set including the eye it's 100%.
---
I have one but no jet pack
---
This is why i feel people need to voice their disappointment in the way it's being developed. Most pf the players quitting at this time don't necessarily care about the nerfs, but rather how they are going about "fixing the game".
---
Fallout 4 had mods...... Which made it way, way better than it is right now. There are no mods and no community assistance to fix what they will not which is the difference between these two games. it was a trivial issue in Fallout 4 if something didn't snap because there was a mod that could clean up everything or help you to snap things together.

ummm i have a lead vein under my camp that spawns every server hop.
---
What your doing differently is you have realistic expectations and dont have anger management issues, theres probably also a large helping of maturity mixed in there too
---
PC
---
I’m seeing that the TSE weapons were probably too much of a crutch for you or your build. Now you actually have to use Vats, go for Headshots, or have a decent build instead of just shooting the ground next to something and they die via Explosive. 
---

---
Try out some other weapons. Try out Bloodied Explosive. There’s other things, and even then, TSE nerf wasn’t that bad as their still basically king of Casual builds. 
---
PC, kind of sucks armor is tied behind level though lol. I'll get there eventually
---
Don't meme that god awful slogan ever again
---
I know for a fact they are at the Grafton Station vendor. Im level 36 and purchased them yesterday.  
---
PSA: If you kill a Legendary and it seems to have no loot, look around on the ground, sometimes the loot falls to the floor instead of remaining on the creature.

 Todd Howard here, reminding you that our spam inbox is full and that all other support request are being 'taken care' of by unpaid Indian interns.

Sadly I am not sure mate. Fo4 has been out almost 5 yrs and has had lots of updates, addons and bugfixes.  This team then releases F76 with the same bugs that the original release Fo4 had!!!
---
I have no doubts Fo5 will become a great game but it will be the Mod'ders that do that not BETH. So far Beth has done nothing with the Mod community regarding F76.
---
Fuck bud, you just can't see the forest because of the trees, hey? They're trying. The fact that they have active members in the community that DO listen and try to implement changes as per suggestions on REDDIT of all places (which isn't the center of the universe, by the way) says a lot. The incessant whining and petulance in this sub is disgusting. People bitch and whine for changes, then bitch and whine because they don't like the changes. Grow up, fahk.
---
I've got a sneak attack vats critical build going with a level 45 anti-armor silenced 10mm pistol. I wear a black tuxedo. I rock patrolman sunglasses, even at night. I disappear with Chameleon armor. And I wreck shit spamming sneak attack head shot vats crits without ever being seen.
---
It's OP. Sshhhhh. Don't let the disillusioned TSE crowd know. 
---
Mostly I look like a special agent badass.
---
However! The build started out as a western cowboy gunslinger. I got a level 50 three star legendary instigating western revolver. Couldn't wait to use it. But it doesn't compare at all to the sneak loadout with a much weaker silenced weapon. In fact, I never use it, because the defensive weakness of the build (no power armor, ever) relies on sneaking. No silencer for western revolvers, so no go.
---
I agree. Buff the revolvers.
---
why do you talk without knowledge, have you bought one at all? i bought 3 of them for  3680 each with hard bargain to select which mutations to have....[https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/460019-fallout-76-mutation-serum-where-to-find-location](https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/460019-fallout-76-mutation-serum-where-to-find-location)
---
It's pretty common, usually see one or two sometimes three on a weekend night. Usually just one on a week night if I play long enough on a server.
---
You launch them from one of three nuke sites. These act as pretty complex dungeons, a nice little process that will probably get old. Doesn't help that they're practically the same instance.
---
Nuke codes are actually a cool process too, there are officers randomly placed in the world with a generated number for one of the three silos. Players are meant to work together to track down the codes. However with the advent of the Internet, we are able to simply Google the codes provided by some gracious benefactor who runs them all down.
---
Another thing you didn't ask about that you'll need, you get a keycard from killing Cargobots. You'll learn the sound if you play long enough. I've been hoarding them up for weekend runs. I'm up to 8 keycards this week
---
Walls
---
The amount of posts like OP’s on here is pretty obnoxious, honestly. So many fanboys crying about people that have genuine reason to be upset. Yikes, like at what point do people step back and see that they’re the ones that need to shut up.
---
Careful, I've heard reports of players who have accidental duplication happen getting banned, and players crafting too many items. You can get banned for the games mistakes and using crafting features. Kinda scared to cook 21 brahmin meat.
---
&gt; and then be able to re-apply these to our own non-legendary armor. If it could only be applied to non-lege dary, it could help focus more on crafting, and make it take much longer for "god" tier weapons to come into play.
---
In other words we'd only be able to craft one stars and it be pretty much useless? 
---
is it being released this month?
---
if so the next patch or 2 will be a make it of break moment for this game.
---
Whoa there billy calm your ponies and tie your shoes, fast travel is an integral part of fallout for me, especially when i get stuck somewhere like when my camp loaded on me earlier today and got stuck in the foundation, or the other day when i got stuck between a junk pile and a fence and was falling constantly
---
This article looks like it was written by someone who hasn't played even the demo. It's an open demo now, no writer or redditor has to take anyone's word for it. I've been playing the demo last weekend and this and having a blast. 😊
---
Yeah I guess just picking the obvious damage increasing perk cards is "super min/maxed" now.
---
&gt; SBQ still just fucks off to an unreachable part of the map
---
Guessing they reused code for dragons from *Skyrim* because dragons absolutely do this. They have the basic attack/retreat pattern, but if after a few they don't die, they'll actually go a good ways away but not fully retreat from the cell. You'll still be under "you can't fast travel when enemies are nearby" and still get a red enemy gem on your radar (however tiny), at least until you leave the cell yourself.
---
Honestly I never fought a SBQ myself. I only played about 12 hours of the beta. Closest I came, I observed a regular scorchbeast from a distance. But from what I've seen in videos, it's basically a dragon, on the backend anyway. Obviously the graphics, the lore, all that are different, but I think it's just recycled dragon code.
---
"I'll be sure to pass the message along..."
---
I'm not opposed to a pistol buff. I like pistols. Deliverer was my buddy in F4. But I've always presumed they are meant to be your secondary weapon. 
---
It's actually literally called "Note". 
---
So I was doing some testing, and with those exact things (except rifleman instead) so hardened receiver, bloody mess, 9x rifleman. My lv45 two-shot handmade does 111 damage. Does that sound right?
---
I believe memory/server restrictions prevent it 
---
Bloodied 44 revolver does more damage than a TSE gatling gun if your health is low fwiw.
---
I will update, probably tomorrow. 
---
Stealth is also broken at the moment as well.
---
I love that this sub is back to posts like this in such a short span of time. 
---
I will be patiently awaiting storytime. 
---
or give em silencers. :( I want a silencer for mine.
---
I read the survival guide and it says they are inaccessible, and are harbour to some exotic collectibles, but you may be able to raid at a later date, plus confirmed pretty sure all dlc is Free
---
Ah ok that makes more sense .. you would still have to trust someone, but I agree is the better way to make it. Still think you need 5 violet flux per leg plus some other materials.
---
Huh, that's uhh, not what I was expecting. Thanks OP!
---
The open demo is live now my man, go try it out. You don't have to take my word or anybody else's for it. Go have fun. 😊
---
Look who's talking.
---
You're referring to SERUMS.  They have a base cost of 4400.
---
I was referring to RECIPES.  They are the high ticket items with a base cost of 22,000.
---
I mean it has what he is looking for swinging a hammer or sword and whacking everything not just one thing 
---
You gonna get the old ban hammer. F
---
Not butt hurt at all. I don't give two shits what you think of this game or that you can afford to buy games. Congratulations on having money. The fact it took you 600 hours of playtime to come to this conclusion is, however, a shocker. 
---
Walk away. You don't have to make a post full of broken English and links to your other complaint posts to get your point across.
---
Likely level 30 + then , ugh
---
I look at the map to see when player icons show up or wait until the icon for mutations shows up below my AP bar. 
---
Grafton station and vendor bot Greg just north of Grafton Station.  May need to be higher level, though.  If you're on PC I have 2 sets left, I can give you one.
---
Why would they address the fanbase? What could they say that would appease their fans? Nothing. It's a lose/lose for them. 
---
Iirc two shot was nerfed to 25% and explosive to 20%
---
 Todd Howard here, Thanking you for your donation of 85 euros,  we appreciate your generosity. 
---
I'm pretty sure the reasons why guns like the gatling gun are so fragile is the gun durability system is broken and dependent on the number of shots fired. So of course a non-auto rifle build is going to last longer than an automatic rifle or an automatic heavy weapon like miniguns.
---
I think the way it's supposed to work is you don't get wanted until they actually \*break\* something. 
---
I'm lvl 150. I'll check there thank you! I'm on XB1
---
They follow the same microtransaction system IN A (originally) 60 DOLLARS GAME
---
I haven't read or even seen gameplay. Is there any type of building or anything like that?
---
I was trying to get the fission gen plans and it took me 8 hrs of playing to get through that even 3 times. I can do it 30 mins solo but the disconnects and game freezes where crazy.
---
We need more Daniels.
---
I’m also a hoarder. Two runs in the schools and I’m all good. Thanks brother.
---
They could solve it by having all bottle variants scrap into a difference resource called "Empty Bottle" which is the core ingredient to Molotov.
---
I think there is already items li ke this (some kind of wooden ski) that first scraps into another object and you can scrap it again to just get wood. So in this case, if you manually scrap "Empty Bottle" again, it goes to glass shards, etc.
---
Fallout 2 inspired X-01 paintjob. Let me be a real Enclave soldier, damn it!
---
Oh, no, not at all. In my mind the cost would just increase (likely astronomically) as you add stars to the weapons/armor.
---
Please don't trivialize the trauma caused by the dev's incompetence.  They did not include an option for Italian marble flooring for the foyer of my wasteland shelter and I need a chaise lounge with leopard-print velvet upholstery to tie together the mid-century kitsch look of my parlor.  Can I craft one?  No.  Also, I've been playing 6 hours per day since November 14th and now I'm starting to get bored!  Inexcusable.  Also my bobby pins are too heavy.
---
Word, happy hunting!
---
 I managed to hit cap limit and do the SBQ all in a span of 2 hours today, sorry you don't have it together :(
---
i will look it up tonight after the kids are in bed. thx m8
---
They are mutant moles dude I doubt they would have any trouble burrowing through wood or concrete
---
Basically just a graphical issue now. It used to be a way to dupe PA, but they patched it so the 2nd suit is just a ghost that you can't pick up.
---
I have an issue where I equip a weapon and it will equip another one ( nocturnal lever action - tse lever action)
---
When I equip power armor parts same story this patch is a hot mess , but hey it runs smooth when it’s supposed to 
---
Open demo is live now. Don't take anyone's word for it, just pick up, play, and enjoy! =)
---
No worries! 
---
You realize half the things you mentioned are already in the OP's list? Did you even bother to read it?
---
Thanks bud.
---
Marsupial works just fine, have you not noticed people jumping several stories high?
---
The scorchbeast doesn’t. 
---
Agreed. The plan system doesn't work properly anyway. Within building it's ok to make something floating (foundation to stairs to floating house) but if you save it as a plan it says that objects are floating
---
The game was developed and is being supported by Bethesda Game Studios Austin, which is not a large studio.
---
The issue is that the whole of 76 is a modded version of F4, which means that BGSA is dealing with two sets of code and having to shoehorn and reconcile every change they make to the game.
---
Some of it is simple such as a damage modifier, but anything structural means a lot of tedious hours of sorting through existing code then modifying, then testing, then repeating until the issue is resolved and/or the fix does not cause unintended consequences.  Even then it’s nearly impossible to know the full effect of a code change until a real world test.  Blizzard uses a PTR for this sort of thing, but again because BGSA is so small and the game has not been profitable, they do not have the money to support a PTR.  This means that until a structural change occurs behind the scenes we are all playing the B.E.T.A. 
---
sorry to hijack but what cooler are you guys on about, never saw a cooler at the Whitespring
---
2 is not half.  “Did you even bother to read it?”
---
Know who I can buy 200 cap serum plans from? I'll buy all of em
---
I got the whole set from Watoga bot in about 6 hops last night
---
Damn that stinks. I think I could get past a lot of the issues and complaints if I didn't feel like there was a significant amount of wasted time due to server disconnects. 
---
Hasnt happened to me at all on PC
---
So you'd still be able to get three stars? The weapon/armor would just have to start out as zero?
---
I think I you could definitely do a better job explaining this. 
---
When it does land... It feels like most of the time all it does is shouting out of its ass.
---
Right, now I understand. Agreed on it probably being hard if not prohibitive to do in Bethesda case. 
---
Checked both last night on a few servers. Don't seem to be a guaranteed item based on what I've seen in a few other threads. Same with the under armor linings
---
My playstyle is also weird :)
---
I think its very kind hearted of you to forgive and keep going.
---
people like you really warm my heart :p
---
its great how all kind of playstyles and people have a place in this game.
---
I also just hope the developers realize that potential and work towards improving the Game as a whole (and give everyone what they want, people who like to grind should be able to do that and feel rewarded, while people who like to kill big strong monsters should also be rewarded and have a lot of monsters to choose from, same goes for people who like to explore or just gather and scrap stuff) 
---
I feel like fallout is such a great base game, but they just havent added all/enough activities at the current state.
---
You can only kill the queen (i wish they would add alot more monsters of that strenght, that reward you with a quest/special items) 
---
I also love scrapping and hoarding :P my junk is also filled with junk and meds.
---
For me the 600 stash limit is really a bummer.
---
I had 3000pounds of stuff on my second character (which is now also limited to 1500 carryweight) 
---
I feel like they should support all types of playstyles alot more and not force us into playing the game the way they want us to.....
---
I still feel sorry for your plastic and other junk, if are on PC i can share some.
---
Also happy you are mentally strong enough to keep grinding, i may have been too demotivated.
---
Anyways i hope you have a good day and enjoy this or any other game :)
---
Fenix had a set last night
---
The Nuka Girl Outfit was broken in the most recent patch. Whatever chest piece you are wearing now is visible and clips through the outfit. Additionally, the stomach skin textures are broken. My character has no belly button and has weird stretch marks on her back
---
Lol
---
You spam crafted 200 costumes?
---
What's the perception change? I'm a high perception build and hadn't heard about it
---
Welp, apparently you can't count either. 
---
Yep. This games weapons are broken. Annoys me a bit because I liked laser rifles in F4. In F76 they are useless. 
---
Most weapons late game dont do extremely little damage in the late game, a lot of weapons will do above 50 damage after you have put on bloody mess with the 3 sets of gunslinger, rifleman, commando, heavy gunner, or any other +60% damage there is, 50 is good enough, and when you have a crit and a sneak shot, 4.07x every other shot is pretty good for damage, and if you adrenal reaction and bloodied on those weapons as well, youll have about a 112 before the crits and sneaks, and when you put it all together, that kind of damage is way more than enough to survive, forgot to mention earlier than since crits dont miss, you can aim at a weakspot (such as head for a super mutant), you will get another multiplier on top of that, if bethesda decides to buff base damage of weapons, then they need to nerf some of these multipliers as well cuz then people using these things will find the game way easier than before, i know not everyone plays with mutations or stealth or vats or legendaries, but chances are high that the players that are not sturggling to kill stuff in this game use one of these or a combination of these
---
The point was to get an idea across to the dev teams; I've by no means refined any of it.
---
i wanted to make a pistol character, then i saw we only got revolvers with the reload speed of a snail.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All pistols suck and non of the perks makes up for it (some might argue they suck too) 
---
Yeah, this has been a thing since release.
---
That’s the issue not the nerfs,but how the are handling things. So bad. Like it’s like this is there first game they have developed and maintain.
---
I've yelled "land you bat bitch so I can beat you to death!" Many a time.
---
it's 75% and 50% of what's left, 87.5% total, 
---
However the distinction only matters so far, as having damage drop below 1/6 of your weapon's damage renders the armor irrelevant (1% damage reduction below that threshold). Assuming you have the blade up to \~150 damage then few enemies have enough armor to matter.
---
Yeah I'm exaggerating. But it's still pretty bad. I can't use mine for more than 3-5 minutes. 
---
Both - All power armours come with the option to install a Stealth boy field that uses your AP's. It's suppose to act like a stealth boy, as long as you don't move. And i tested out of power armour as well. Body armour with the stealth ability is broken, "stand fast" doesn't help at all in the dark like it's suppose too. Not sure if that's because the actual perks are broken or not.   This really sucks hard because i did the grind for the caps to buy the plan for the t-60 stealthboy torso and it's freaking broken...... gawd that really stings. 
---
Also I'm not sure what you mean by stale endgame, I'm level 140 with 400+ hours and the games still plenty fun to me. 
---
I'd be happy if gun runner stacked with other speed boosts (mainly speed demon). I think mobility is a good trade off for damage in the case of pistols but at the moment if you have speed demon it overrides gun runner so pistols only advantage is gone. 
---
Kool have a good day. Also a great life.
---
Come home soon! I baked your favorite 「Ｃａｎｎｅｄ Ｄｏｇ Ｆｏｏｄ」。
---
Yes, regularly, usually in the chalet type buildings... down the sides
---
Not an issue really but I would like to know how the team feels about the 10mm SMG and what perks affect it's damage output. From what I have gathered from other players is it is classified as a rifle, but it feels like it should benefit from the "Guerilla" perk (automatic pistols). At the moment it feels like automatic pistols are a very small group of weapons and not worth it compared to automatic rifles or non-auto pistols. I'd like a quick rogue like run and spray build but I feel like the game has pushed me more towards revolvers (still fun though)
---
Nah, that is normal. The big appeal is to turn them into glowing ones by launching a nuke. 
---
You too bud!
---
I highly doubt it. For one, what possible benefit does Bethesda have if the restore TSEs? Second, do you think anyone's going to still be playing in a couple weeks?
---
Good write-up. I hope it is helpful.
---
Yeah vendors should have more caps I should be able to make 25 k in a 8 hr span not 300 hours for it.
---
Vendor need to buy : ammo , and have bigger cap pools
---
Pistols are in a very bad spot.
---
None of the Pistols (items) is good or cool in any way. (they are all revolvers that reload VERY slowly, or 10mm that do really low damage, idk why we dont have a cool 9mm pistol)
---
Also the perks seem kinda weak compared to other weapon classes
---
The is no real reason to go pistol, you "nerf" yourself alot by doing it.
---
I love the style of pistols, but i hate the slow reload speed they have.  
---
May have went pistol even if its weak but its just no fun to use AT ALL 
---
Yep. Happened to me once. 
---
I am pretty sure that is what will happen, there’s too much to salvage at this point
---
I only just started pvp but I'm pretty sure you can go after a wanted players camp and be fine. What happens is wanted players hide in their friends camp and you go wanted for tagging a building of an unwanted player, which is the camp they're in. It's kinda a clever trick tbh.
---
The logistics too. Like, how do you stretch your urethra? And was he talking about stretching it length-wise or width-wise? As in, circumference? And while we’re on the subject- is he a male or female? I’ve heard of dick beads but are there urethra dildos for females or something? Like, what am I missing here? And I imagine that’s quite painful, especially because stretching takes time. You’d have to experience the sensation of your urethra being stretched for minutes, maybe even *hours* for there to be any appreciable effect. And this isn’t even brushing on the question of why, *why* stretch your urethra. Do you not pee fast enough as is? Are you trying to show off? To who? Is there some sort of urethra stretching competition out there that I am unaware of? And if so, by what metric do they even compete? Do they take a pre-urethral-stretch measurement, and compare it to the post-stretch measurement, or is it a come-one-come-all, “The stretchiest will win” sort of situation where whoever’s urethra is stretched out the most wins? Of course this wouldn’t be very fair to those gifted individuals born with stretchy urethras from birth. 
---
Lol woops, I guess half the problem solved 😭 I've only really been over encumbered when game deleted my armor with weight reduction and that took 4 days to find replacement 
---
 Todd Howard here, reminding you our games work and that any problems concerning game play fall squarely on the credit card holder's ability and wallet size. 
---
it really really hurt my inner child to use "hotfix".... so i must be insane.  THis game is exactly like going out with someone hot and crazy. Sex and thrills Amazing! But you want to slash your wrists the other half of the time.
---
thing is what kind of looter shooter has no fucking end game? wow had raids destiny has strikes what does fallout 76 have? nothing not even 1 dungeon to fucking grind
---
No it's not. It *was* coming, but I doubt any additions/dlc are planed any more. It's time to face facts; this game is dead.
---
Submitting a post that has the word duper but no facts in the post is desperate and sad attempt for attention. I feel that duping posts are shill reddit accounts meant to divert attention and blame with problems in fo76 towards phantom "dupers".
---
I just do it very slowly, haven't had a problem yet though I *have* seen weapons and armor pop up on occasion. 
---
I remember the last one I found was a pipe revolver. Somehow I doubt that would have ended up being a legendary
---
yes the 200caps limit for vendors and the fact that there isnt another way to farm caps make it very slow to earn them.
---
The 25k should be earned somewhere, right now it takes along time and feels bad earn them

Xbox backs up saved data to the cloud, as well. You can "manage" game and there's a way to copy the cloud save back over.  
---
When you read the patch notes most of it looks good and makes sense(repair stuff aside).  Bug fixes etc.  - The problem is you then start hearing from people playing the game. bobby pins are increased in white, repair fix is debilitating, new and old bugs exist or are worse.  So people like me who quit because of all the bugs, are not inclined to pick the game back up - no matter how much I enjoyed the gameplay.  The frustration of playing a game you love, and it breaking constantly, is not worth the moments of joys you get from it.  I am resigned to never launching a nuke in FO76 - Game crashed anytime I got to far into a silo.  I wish that werent the case.
---
Make every build viable option is like fix every bug.
---
Honestly sp co-op like borderlands would have been a perfect game. Story, lore, and optional online sounds ideal. Also it seems like it would've been alot easier to create this vs the 76 we have now, less server issues, dupers wouldn't really bother anyone unless playing online but It would still be alot easier to manage. Just saying they bit off a bit more than they could chew, I liked the idea of trying something "new" with the mmo genre but it just feels like they where trying to mimic the success of eso. But I can honestly say I wholeheartedly love 76 alot more than eso, the gameplay is alot better imo (despite current server issues)
---
 Its about 130 but I have perks left. ;)
---
I’ll check this out if it’s true, thank you!
---
Relax buddy. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Sit back down
---
I know this is late to the party and probably won't be seen, but this is kind of relating to the server stability/crashes issue. Can we perhaps add some checkpoints to the Belly of the Beast quest? Like after each Transponder perhaps, or at the very least once you enter the Glassed Cavern? I've had to restart this quest 4 times now because of CTDs, the most recent attempt having made it all the way through that long dungeon to the last encounter and winning it, but when I went into my items to eat some food to give me more carrying capacity to bring my loot along with me, the client crashed. Now I'm back to going to the very first transponder again and slogging through that dungeon again. I didn't log back in that night, and I haven't made any other attempts on this quest since then. 
---
There are some other quests that could use some extra checkpoints that I had this problem with too, mostly in the main storyline, but I can't remember them now. More checkpoints all around, please.
---
Unrelated note, can we also maybe not have 1-3 Scorchbeasts waiting for me every time I fast travel to anywhere in Cranberry Bog? Yeesh.

Alpha damage determines killing power, if you double your per shot damage you end up dealing about triple the final damage, as armor reduction is based on per shot damage, so doubling one halves the other.
---
This is the problem, autos have trash per shot damage, so it takes more bullets, but they also have their damage reduced more by armor, meaning even more bullets.
---
For reference, it takes 20 bullets from a minigun that deals 14 damage to match 1 bullet from a gatling gun that deals 79 against an enemy with 100 armor. Exponential bullets means exponential weapon breaking.
---
Anyone know where u can buy the plans for the serums at ??
---
Mate im level 150 and that is one plan i have been hunting for
---
Camden park has at least one spot with around 8-10 beer bottles at the stall with the hotdog eating quest. Other parks are probably decent for them too.
---
Go to the freestate bunkers, top of the world (2nd floor). Around 50 bottles guaranteed
---
The icebox outside the golf club is what I’m talking about. Maybe I assumed too much🤔
---
90% of the players guns that got nerfed were not TSE.
---
But I can guarantee you that the next post in this thread will be some moron telling you that your TSE was OP.......even though you didn't have a TSE.
---
They mentioned that they are working on the stash sizes. They need to find a better way to store data so that large stash sizes (Such as 1000+) won’t heavily lag servers. They’re trying to think of a more long term solution rather than breaking servers by increasing the stash size constantly.
---
BRAVE
---
1. The map is enormous
---
2. Scorchbeasts exist
---
I never use fast travel in any single-player Bethesda game (except New Vegas but that's a whole other point), but I'm happy to *pay* for the privilege in Fo76.
---
Have an exact time? I have about 10 plans or so. 
---
Buy pa excavator calibrated shocks plan.
---
Craft pa left right excavator legs with fixitgood perk.
---
Sell
---
Eh, only TSE I ever found on my own was a pipe gun. Dunno if legendaries drop from these, but there’s legendary *everything*
---
Todd Howard here, thank you for following the support service guidelines.
---
Your support ticket number is #423353
---
Please allow 4 days or 96 hours for a reply.
---
Lets just first see the interest
---
Logging out and back in should fix the mutations not working at all.
---
I prefer H E A T E D Leather Right Leg to a puny B L A D E D Leather Right Leg myself. 
---
Now who’s greedy. Ha. 
---
If I worked at Bethesda I'd be asking for fucking hazard pay to take part in an AMA on reddit right now
---
New players? You honestly think there's going to be new players for this game?
---
Yeah, guess with nothing else to do this weekend, I may turn this into a 3 paragraph story if people care about my endeavour to aquire the *Leather Right Leg*
---
Downvoted? Really?
---
Good to know even with the update it is still a scarce one to find
---
Well, i still play for now.  But im not happy with Bethesda. And i feel they know this
---
Ticket submissions have been outsourced to the Bethesda Watoga branch
---
Lol people said the same thing about ESO
---
One of the guys I play with is pretty much constantly wanted and it's a blast. Farming the queen? He's wanted. Whitesprings? Wanted. In my base? Wanted. 
---
Also if you're wanted you lose your wanted caps rather than caps based on level. So for me it's actually cost efficient to have a bounty. I lose a 10 cap bounty in pvp, it's not an issue but if I die without a bounty I lose like 250ish per death and that can eat through my caps real quick.
---
I've had success shifting over to the misc tab before putting anything in the hopper. 
---
As soon as your feet touch the ground open your pipboy. When it loads you are good to go.
---
Give me a refund.
---
You already have the option to fix things individually. Its us lazy asses who like the repair all button.
---
I'm with you. A few disconnects and small bugs... I think the people complaining put in more hours than I do at my full time job
---
Just tag her once then kill all the scorched and deathclaws shit attacking others. You're still helping! Of course get stuck in when she lands though. 
---
last patch was a roll back patch they used an older version of the game and didnt merge it properly with the new patch, so many fixs where reversed and a whole list of new stuff got broken. 
---
The hotfix was only to fix 3 things. Duping is back and happening big time i hear and players are reporting that by moving stuff in their inventory they are accidentally duping some items. Also stealth is messed up for a lot of people and builds that are crit based have been nerf'd as well.
---
We will see a whole new crop of god weapons soon i believe most likely with the weightless effect, but with more variety in other effects.
---
If you've played since, though, it's already copied your current save over the cloud save, unfortunately. Sometimes when they don't match up my Xbox asks me which I want to use.
---
Yeah it didn’t ask me either lol
---
*New* issues I've noticed since this week's patches (copy/pasted from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/albq87/what_has_the_patch_broke_for_you/)):
---
* Cap stashes now (usually) have only 1 cap in them. You can't server hop for them anymore. And, even though it sounds like they all are supposed to be fixed static containers, either some aren't or they removed some stashes. (Not being able to server hop for them now is intentional; not sure about the other parts.)
---
* Headlamp mods for power armors are now being marked as items from the Atomic Shop.
---
* Mutations randomly stop working. (This is fixed by switching servers. I first noticed it when I got infected with "The Blight", but it hasn't happened every time I've caught that disease.)
---
* The plans and recipes for some items that I am able to craft (small water purifier and mentats) are not showing as (Known) at vendors.
---
* While server hopping for random events near the Charleston Station, less and less things are loading in. At first [the weapons bench in the train station stopped showing up](https://i.imgur.com/YuwZwFq.png). Now [the door to where the vendor bot is has disappeared](https://i.imgur.com/dkpbkhV.png) as well, allowing me [to walk right in](https://i.imgur.com/4oQGWAR.png). (Entirely closing the game fixed this.)
---
* You can now fast travel to any player.
---
* Being infected with rad worms doubles the effects of all buffs/debuffs/mutations.
---
* The Inspector outfit cannot be worn with underarmor. Equipping the outfit unequips the underarmor and vice versa.
---
i get that. but the idea of, "repair all should fix as much as possible with the supplies i have" is going to lead to, "why is this new feature fixing my x items before my y items?" 
---
I've meet 99% of those I play with on instagram. There is no mechanism yet on 76 to meet and greet besides just waking up to people in a creepy way! But the best is to imbed yourself in a public space and just talk. If you're on PC: vault310 
---
I think you're boned, then. Or would that be Xboned? LOL!
---
They are op
---
they remain in the area hours after the nuke zone on that particular server
---
I am on the ps4 and I honestly had a pretty good experience on opening day and for several weeks.  The only odd glitch I saw was on my daughters character. She built a camp when she traveled to it she was in a rock. But it wasnt a big deal, she could walk out of the rock without a problem.    I had a grand total of 1 crash through level 50 that I remember. I saw those spaghetti dogs once(and it was when someone else was already fighting them and I showed up after).  I am a solo player and usually avoided people.  Then I became confident enough to run silos.  I attempted running silos 6 times.  I crashed every single time.  I did these runs over a period of a week before and after the early december patch which supposedly fixed whatever was causing crashes in Alpha silo.  After that week I've crashed multiple times, encountered various bugs, getting stuck and having to log out, I stopped capturing workshops which I had been doing with regularity before experienced major lag I never had before.  It's like I was playing a different game. I enjoy the gameplay so much but I ended up putting FO76 down. Whenever I here "wouldnt it be nice" pop up on my spotify playlist I get an urge to play, but after checking back here and other places, its like every time they "fix" something, something else breaks. I dont want to put that effort in again. I still havent launched a nuke because of the broken silos. My heart cant take another crash when i am 2 minutes from completion.
---
I thought it was 30 minutes?
---
I hammer the collect button as soon as they're killed for this reason OP, it's second nature now 
---
Todd Howard here, We apologize for the unsatisfactory service we have provided.
---
We currently have the best unpaid Indian interns going over your complaint and will credit your account a generous 500 atoms as compensation.
---
I'll be happy to craft for people who can't hack it :(
---
It is pretty cool, I would say adrenal reaction is my fav. Sorry that happned I hope im not a victim of this but because I paid tons of caps for all my mutations. 
---
As previously mentioned, pistols are a VATS weapon. with the right mods and perks a lowly 22 damage full auto 10mm/pipe pistol can become ridiculous in VATS because of all the damage modifiers that each multiply damage in VATS.
---
Yeah, I had a few hours tonight and did a run through Allegheny asylum and noticed this. Plus I also found static ghouls and a few that ghosted through walls. 
---
So I guess they're not entirely specific to vendors. I just checked with :
---
-Watoga
---
-Phoenix
---
-Harper's
---
-Charleston
---
-Sutton
---
-Welch
---
-Lewisburg
---
-Grafton
---
-Whitespring Station (and Resort)
---
Did NOT find it.
---
Whence I do, I'll post it.
---
R. 
---
I'd love if there was a run down town we all had to work to repair. Maybe something like Lewisberg that has all the tents set up. Everyone chips in resources and for say 6 hours the town becomes vendor shops we can sell at or it draws in a unique vendor.  But everyone is involved. 
---
Even more boss battles like SBQ, that draw the attention to the server. A massive mega Sloth battle that needs 8 plus players to defeat with it's own rewards etc. 
---
And maybe an event based around soloman lake, where people come in to build a water filtration system while fighting off enemies. Once complete the lake provides purified water for an hour. 
---
I know someone's just had a bad day when they launch a nuke and I'm disconnected seconds later. Finishing your first silo is the climax of the game.
---
I hate it that they rarely land. But when they do… it’s my time to shine! And get hit by other people’s guns. 
---
Was it Sugar Grove in the The Mire?
---
i got a level 45 one on PS4 that i wont mind parting with for a few caps.
---
i also got a western anti armor (just anti armor) so that wont cost much either, but can get alot higher damage.
---
I went from 495 to 510 to 695 and back.
---
I'll take the 695, thanks.
---
You want my spare unyielding sentinel set I got xD? Maybe 3 more sets of it if i ask some friends ?
---
The truth is everything that is good is duped a million times 
---
As a person who has done technical support we basically had a canned response for everything because then you are all sending a consistent message from the company. People got mad when they got the same response on a different ticket asking the same question. 
---
I’d run with you, I have some pretty active friends too. Add me if you like, I’m on pc level 215. IGN rampantrifleman
---
The only question I have for Bethesda is why you have to have two separate items ( burnt magazine and the brunt unstoppables magazine) in the have look identical but serve no function, can't even scrap them
---
TSE is still pretty good too its my one star two shots that really felt the nerf
---
Separate recipe might be fine, even if there's ten different recipes for Molotov's because of the types of bottle because the game lets you choose to only show the recipes you can actually craft. 
---
Nailed it with the second paragraph. Imagine if this was your game, the problem would be fixed in no time. Wait, wasn't there something in previous FO games about refilling bottles with water that generalised the bottles and converted a filled bottle into just "water" or "purified water"? Might be a different game altogether. I play lots of these water-gathering simulators, could have got it confused
---
What does TL;DR mean? I see it lots and have no clue on its meaning
---
Critical mass is 200 damage per shot. which is very hard to do without sneak damage bonuses and critical, meaning any build around anything other than criticals and sneak is going to have a hard time
---
100 is good, but you are still looking at a nearly 65% damage reduction on high end enemies, and even shirtless scorched are reducing your damage output by half, and they're the least armored enemies around. Armor piercing helps if you can stack multiple high end sources to drop armor on a super mutant from 178 down to your weapon's damage value.
---
You can make less damage work, but your weapons degrade equally fast whether you're doing full damage or 20%, and some weapons can only dream of reaching that level of damage.
---
The armor system and the way the devs treat armor means damage falls off exponentially.
---
I wish I had the patience to do this...
---
That's funny. That's usually my reaction, too. "Whelp, that's enough of this for today."
---
This is not uncommon.
---
From personal experience I can tell you the Civil War Era Uniform and Dress sell for a lot of caps relative to the materials to make them (3 cloth and 1 gold/crystal sells for about 15 caps). They're light at .1 pounds. It's a great way to make your 1400 caps for the day. With Super Duper you can turn about 210 cloth and 70 gold or crystal into 1400 caps. I imagine the Halloween costumes are no different.
---
no legs, just feet.
---
I personally don't care for dodgy, as I'd rather use the AP for power attacks. If you plan on not usong PA, I'd switch it for White Knight. Which even after the nerf is still incredibly useful since normal armor tends to break quicker.
---
I used to do balance work for a mmo around 8 years back as a volunteer then I moved on to mods and now I work on survival bases / ships and such in online sandbox games so I know how to balance cost / damage  without making it to op 
---
really I feel the legend system needs a whole over haul making it more about crafted goods (still finding drops) this would make duping less useful but also increase player customization - also giving the game a long term economy as crafters will be able to make the items slowly and customize the designs to players letting them play the game instead of just running around hunting legends for the chance of a good drop
---
One time I found a note that said that this building has Pipe. Obviously it was a pipe pistol but it was pretty funny to me at the time.
---
In regard to the excavator power armor, I noticed it's my only PA that increases carry weight. And yes, the carry weight is so erratic. Up and down 100 items. So weird.
---
Can we *please* get Dragon Rend?
---
I have a 2 shot plasma gatling in my bank I refuse to let go (let me have my denial) knowing the moment I hand it off the next day I'll see a patch
---
Alas, I put my garb of mysteries in the box at Mama Dulce's 😕
---
It's a random pick up. The item is random and should scale to your level. Others have said there's even a chance of the item being legendary so probably worth a look if you find one
---
I figured it out.  Thanks anyways
---
......me too...
---
Hi Todd thanks for reaching out to me especially over Reddit, I am amazed you even took the time to respond, what with the controversy over this game and that canvas (or was it nylon) bag incident, which must be giving the company and yourself some major headaches!
---
I totally understand what you're saying but unfortunately I am a broke software developer and I simply can't pay to win, what with the maxed out credit cards and mount of debt I am in.
---
I live hand to mouth each month and it's a real struggle, but I guess you know what going broke kinda feels like? You know since the games broke, and Bethesda must be broke since you guys couldn't afford to get the bags right? 
---
Any way, I'll just jump back into Resident Evil 2...
---
I guess my point is we've all had the ability to respec points for awhile, Im about the same level as you and I have so many level ups saved up i could easily respec 30 points if i wanted to. Its your own fault if you spent every single level up on a new perk card that you dont need. Also ive respeced like 4-5 points ever, I cant imagine needing to move 60% of my perk points to respec, that seems like it was poorly spec'd to begin with.
---
They shouldn’t be powerful because...they’re pistols. Where’s the common sense here?
---
It wouldn't work like that. Either each projectile will be actually "fired" (the gun's striker or firing pin will hit the primer, ignite the powder, and the resulting gas will cause it to leave the barrel), in which case you'd expect both rounds to have full velocity  (such as on an AN-94); or the second projectile somehow was not "fired", in which case it should be doing zero damage and your gun should malfunction. 
---
Broken game and an entitled dev team that can't handle it...think that's the source of the hate Bethesda are rightfully taking.
---
Don't worry though, cant hurt a companies feelings. The dev team and CM's might get a bit butt hurt, but fix the game and that goes away.
---
Don't like it or cant handle it, don't sell products that are broken in the future.
---
Nice "essay" though, shame you felt the need to write one no matter how short
---
That perk changed the game for me, I shall struggle to jump/jetpack smack them no more 
---
Have some twinkle for your winkle Todd!
---
Yeah that's def a bad day. The above was one of my squadmate's first ever nukes and he didn't even get to push the button.
---
Thanks for your opinion on my grammar I wish I where better at English only god know why I wasn’t born with better English skills or why I wasn’t born in the uk or USA :( 
---
Your a true hero of this community 
---
THANK YOU :o
---
BSG want players to slow down in their progression through the game to maintain the player base, except they are doing this in such a bullish clunky way it has become blatant and is angering people.
---
&gt;Give 
---
OK. This was my 1st time ever to witness this. So many legendaries, even with normal bloated ones.
---
That is good to know.  I won't pretend they are doing everything perfectly, my main point is that now is a really good chance for things to go right. I am glad to hear that the modders are doing their part, but unhappy to hear that it does not seem as though Bethesda is being responsive enough. It seems like they are slowly moving in the right direction in terms of community involvement and followthrough, but they definitely have a ways to go in that department.
---
whats it for?
---
The almighty PIPE
---
Ahh, misunderstood you. My mistake. 
---
An anti armor explosive combat shotgun that I really need 
---
We need St. Jiub to rid WV of molerats
---
This just in: Redditor thinks online multiplayer game should be balanced - revolutionises gaming industry.
---
That person asked someone else if downvoting me can affect me. In general it doesn't. I'm here to fight for us. Not to gain popularity.
---
In the beginning, one out of three nuked zone I visit ends up in disconnecting or crashing with the last two patches, I'd be lucky to get one disconnects.  Before SBQ  is a 50/50 chance in getting disconnected now three SBQ's summoned, zero disconnects so far.  BGS gets an A for effort.
---
Love it. 
---
I know that feel bro. This was half the reason I stopped playing.
---
Maybe if you knew how to sell bulk n stuff you would have caps.
---
Go to Welch station it’s always there for me
---
Back before a few patches hit blueprinting a full budget house was possible, even though I believe it was a glitch. 
---
I wonder why they restrict the blueprint budget, when storing a whole structure on moving is totally possible..?
---
I did something to mine before level 50 so I will npt know what that is like. 
---
Jamesp1989 feel free to add me 
---
not fallout but great sword/sns vs amatsu
---
Disconnects happen regularly.  Server crashes happen regularly.  They know this, you know this.  What do you expect their response to be other than a canned tech support reply to check your connectivity issues?  Do you want them to launch a nuke for you?  I don't get what you're trying to accomplish reaching out to them other than to waste their time and dissuade them from tackling real issues.  Maybe there is issues on your end, its possible.  Follow their guide, if you're solid, that's all you can do.
---
Gimme more walls, roofs, basically anything to make it look like an actual building and not a Minecraft hut.
---
I have everything, all of those throngs to sell. But it’s the refresh rate of them. I’d have enough, but it’s that refresh rate. And the guy said that if I don’t buy it from him tonight, then he’ll sell it
---
I have the exact same problem with my lever-action rifle and my pipe rifle, other weapons are fine. The suggestions didn't help.
---
Did you open a ticket?
---
Will do!
---
Yep I can one hit ghouls with a regular super sledge in white spring (no meele perks but a heavy gunner) but I can’t kill them with some shots of a tse Gatling I think I takes about 7 (didn’t count it really but meele is just way faster and dosnt consume bullets)
---
Spend hours looking for shadowed leather limbs and BOS limbs or torso. Not one. Hours!
---
This is brought up so much an they already commented they know we want junk decor but it's really hard on servers for an online game an are trying to work out the specifics.
---
&gt; This is my first reddit post. 
---
Please go back to lurking. It wasn't a good one.
---
Of course it is. You just have to have an engineering degree from vault tech university to understand why. 
---
I lost all of the bulked scrap I was carrying in the last hotfix. 
---
Hell yeah I'll give it to any young noob that joins my team and doesn't know what it does. Then I'll share starched genes 2. Then profit??!?
---
Too Long; Didn't Read
---
It seems a bit steep on price anyway man
---
Excellent well thought out comment, why this other poster is being abusive is very strange. You clearly described how I feel about the White knight nerf.
---
I’ll wiggle it down by like 500. He was pretty tough 
---
You can buy this for 200 caps at  Camden Park vendor bot.  Sorry...
---
Why thank-you kind stranger
---
I'll grow up then. Stopped playing the game two days ago. I'll unsub, too. You guys are just as toxic as the haters. Can't take a joke. And I don't fit in either group. I'll stop wasting my time.
---
No shit. This is the equivalent of the ps network being down. It doesn't affect other platforms.
---
No, you *want* 6000 caps in the next 2 hours. GLFH!
---
Sadly when a scorchbeasts lands, melee is the fastest way to kill them
---
Nah man that’s not it
---
So far, only my Excavator power armor increases my carry weight. It increases by 100. It sure would be nice to use my Nuka Cola PA, or not have to wear PA just for the carry weight increase. I use it just for the fast travel convenience.
---
To be honest, friend, I have no idea.    I got max performance out of my weapon through trial and error.  That does sound like a decent amount of damage though.  While my Gatling does 132, I suspect it has a slightly slower rate of fire than you can get out of your hand made.  111 sounds decent though. 
---
Out of curiosity, how's the sneak/sniper thing working for you right now? Genuinely curious, because I've been having a HELL of a time getting out from under "caution" since the latest patch...
---
BSG seem to be pushing all players into Power Armor for some reason, they seem obsessed.
---
The globally accepted statistics apply to everything but F.O. got ya...
---
TheMeiserVader 
---
People can’t tell if *legally gotten* was sarcasm or not. If it wasn’t I feel for you, that patch fekin hurt people who actually got lucky and found badass loot. Anyone with a TSE weapon of any kind that they got off a random legendary got shafted because of cheaters
---
*facepalm*
---
I'm on PC and I've had a few problems with instability when I crank my textures to ultra and battle a bunch of monsters but that's my old video card. There's been some server instability here and there but nothing too tragic. I've logged 140ish hours and I still love playing this game after a long day of work.
---
Been happening since launch, CM's said they let the dev team know by passing the info along....2-3 months ago :/
---
To be fair it probably got fixed....then rolled back :(
---
Only excavator pa will give you an extra 100lbs. Too bad since its so ugly. I want the red version you see on the in-game posters during the quest.
---
Considering scorchbeasts have the same ai as dragons, I’ll be it would be easy to put in
---
You definitely have to rely on sneak attack/crits/chems more now and also a fully dedicated build including 9 ranks in weapon damage is more needed.  
---
I think before TSE's made it too easy, you didn't even need a very dedicated build and could free up perks for whatever else you want.
---
"People", yes, "The entire fucking internet" though? 76 has become a joke. Hell, people are talking about Anthem being "The next Fallout 76" when they say it might fail. The game's become synonymous with failure. It doesn't matter if they release a patch tomarrow completely repairing every bug, balancing the game perfectly, and giving free un-nerfed TSEs to every player, its reputation is ruined. There's no coming back from that.
---
Oh hello same issue I had from a month ago.  Things like this is why I'm off spending my free time elsewhere.  I'm guessing they haven't fixed it yet.  I gave up trying to 'play'.  Now I'm all about building fun CAMPS, but CAMPS have every bug on the planet then they fix a minor one and more pop up.
---
Fallout 4 for "Camps" if you want. 
---
Use alt characters 
---
Drop Site C2 or Drop Site V9, or the boxcar east of the NAR repair yard near Watoga.
---
I am indeed on PC I’ll add you. Looking forward to it. 
---
I've always been told its past level 55 you'll begin to see them at Grafton Station (which is where I got mine when I was level 61 I believe). Grafton, Welch and Lewisburg stations are your best bet
---
If it's true why are you trying so hard to convince other people?
---
I’ll add you for sure. I’m also on PC
---
Lol don't worry. When Bethesda nerfs melee next, all builds are equally bad.
---
Melee is the single best build in fallout 76 right now. No question. There is no competition. *one shot* while possible is a big exaggeration, but melee is the highest dps you’re gonna get while having reasonable periods between repair
---
I have never personally operated a gatling gun. It seems plausible the complex arrangement of moving parts, high internal pressures of combustion and inevitable barrel friction would take a heavy toll. From a gameplay perspective, the durability disparity may account for the added utility of range. The 'board with nail' specifically might also have an egregiously high durability, but it is difficult to compare without first quantifying the civil war era handcranked monstrosity.
---
Bethesda please fix this....if you know how! If your fix for this is going to delete all NPC's from the game, or make junk weigh 5 x the amount or break mutations keep the fix and remove the event or at best stick a big ass warning label on it!
---
We get your point, you are now labouring it to the point it has become suspicious.
---
What is your agenda?
---
Typical tse response. Idc what you say. I don't use it for PvP. I paid for the game and I enjoy being overpowered after I logged 200+ hours in a game.
---
200+ hours in and my best gun does a little over 100 damage is unacceptable
---
That Gun is actually a reference to the .223 pistol in FO1 &amp; 2, which is itself a reference to the Blade Runner movies.
---
I’d like a slightly larger cap amount from the vendors, but nothing too extreme.  I would much more prefer though that spent caps aren’t added back at a 1:4 ratio to their cap amount and that you could barter for high priced items like you could in previous games. 
---
If they have something that costs 10k and I don’t have the caps, I should be able to empty my stash trading to buy it.  If we got this route, keep ammo as unsellable as it would make it too easy. 
---
How about starting with: making all builds not suck compleatly? Can't be that hard.
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/akpRGgbfzm26A/giphy.gif
---
Sorry about the bugs please fill in this BETA survey form....standard Bethesda tbh :(
---
Feels to meet it's been stealth nerfed in values.
---
The one thing its going for it is its a new IP and it cant be worse than fo76 at this point i guess :/
---
Can confirm, unable to snap a simple Second Story to a simple first story from blueprints
---
What's the point of not saying anything and staying silent? Figured making my issue public helps inform others instead of just standing by not doing anything. No I don't expect them to launch a nuke for any of us in the group. It would be nice if they at least acknowledged there were issues instead of pushing it on our hardware. Working in the tech field I know that some companies take things like actual tickets more seriously as they tend to impact their internal metrics more so than a tweet.
---
I’ve counted 3

I use both of those mods, and I agree in full with you. I'm unfortunately a bit of a hoarder. When I'm carrying Too Damned Many weapons, it's very handy to reduce the number I've got to scroll through by clicking the header so it only shows particular subclasses of weapons. Likewise over on the Aid tab (I cook things and (ab)use the Pharma Farma perk.
---
Does anyone know if having higher Int boost your chances of learning a recipe from scrapping an item?
---
Y'all keep talking about how "mod authors" will save everything. 
---
No they fucking won't. Like, you've seen how completely shit most mods for Fallout 4 are, right? Yeah, I can't possibly imagine why Bethesda is rejecting your unsolicited submissions of mods they never asked for, from modders with no professional game development experience, that have gone through zero QA, and typically are low quality.   
---
LOL get the fuck out with that nonsense my dude. 
---
i went to whitesprings hours after leaving the nuke zone and there were so many still there
---
Still wish they would just look at bioware on the Anthem Reddit they are insanely involved with the community. 
---
Thanks for your post, this is THE real issue, we'll never have a balanced game until Bethesda change the way armor works.
---
I had a great surplus(11 or so?) fusion cores, so I thought I would go all-PA and hit the harder areas. Also get more loot. Now I'm down to 2, and have to put the PA away. I wasn't doing wild overhand strikes with my All Rise, it just ran down way faster than normal. 
---
OHHHHHHH my god that makes so much sense. I thought normal enemies just could happen to drop legendaries. Thanks!!
---
I mean eso still does it once or twice a month.
---
\^\^This\^
---
I think you may be onto something, God knows why though, Power Armor may be strong but it is loud clumping and ugly even with all these fancy bling paint jobs, wearing it feel  claustrophobic with the intrusive HUD that blocks your view of this wonderful map they created. It's like forcing people to wear sunglasses in an art gallery while wearing a suit of chain maille armor.
---
Yeah, lost my robot chest piece that way :/ wasn’t high level but it was the only one I had! Sad times man...
---
I just think the people who have bugs and hate the game are on here complaining while the people who like the game are playing it. Honestly I don't come to this subreddit much because there is nothing fun here and I just hang with friends on discord who actually like the game. 
---
Yes.
---
My 1* two shot handmade sucks now.
---
My 3* quad explosive radium sucks now .
---
My 2* Instigating Super Sledge is easy mode though.
---
shotgun and enforcer - she lands....
---
Remember that higher level players in your group may cause higher level enemies to spawn.
---
But have fun, and maybe we will see at the wasteland. 
---
They literally put multiplayer into a game that didn't support multiplayer; but you can't see the "love and attention" they gave?  
---
" Don't know how to fix such a problem "  
---
Yeah that's for damn sure. 
---
this is a known problem..i only tried this once..and what was annoying was that i had more than enough of those food container things and it never completed the quest for me
---
Well, some builds should suck completely, so that you gotta try to make builds that doesn't suck. But making more builds to not suck completely -- yeah, that would be fair. And this is a little but not what OP was saying.
---
&gt; I wrote down 1000 emails explaining what i was doing, support tickets and tons of other stuff.
---
Well, not to be rude, but how did you manage to craft 1,000 emails so quickly without duping?
---
Yes it is my own fault that I decided to try melee and then find out it isn’t enjoyable for me. But that does not change the fact that the game is a tedious grindy mess currently. I made a mistake, sure, but the mountain I need to climb to reverse the mistake is absolutely abhorred. Excuse me for attempting to try something new and trying to enjoy and experience something in a video game where the whole core idea is to have fun and not have to work.
---
What system?
---
I can only do the shell of a 2-story 5-square (in a plus sign layout) with the blueprint budget. I only use them at workshops. 
---
Xbox
---
Grats\~, but how does one even go about getting / farming a 3-star All Rise?!
---
Yes that's what im talking about. A vault boy or girl turret. 
---
now i can back then no.
---
I hear you man.  I’ve been through the same thing.  Place a gate first and nothing will attach to it on either side and I also suspect that the gate has different parameters.  I settled on fencing my garden directly agains the house and having a exterior door lead directly into the garden
---
   
---
cool, They can repair the body to body, it is incredibly strong. ? of 1 hit matas 
---
They level to your character
---
It's a 10mm pistol.  think about that going up against the undead or a super mutant.  you might as well use a bb gun.  44 and 45 do more damage sure but not much;  ammo is much smaller than a rifle or shotgun.   If you want to beef up pistols to be just as good as rifles and shotguns, you'd have to triple their damage.
---
Hmmm interesting, very interesting 
---
Calibrated shocks give another 100. Excavator PA is my most valuable PA at lvl 98
---
Nothing changed after trying this, it was worth the try though. Thank you. 
---
With this new patch you should find them easily.
---
You available to trade caps for the marsupial and speed demon serum now? 
---
While I have you on the line,  where did you find your All Rise? 
---
Display cabinets for:
---
- Armor - I have 5 suits that take space in my inventory AND i can't tell the difference between them right now
---
- Weapons - I have weapons that I ditched but would have loved to display (chrome or tricentennial paint jobs, cool guns in general)
---
- Toys - bears, mr fuzzy, jangles, toy trucks, cars, etc...
---
- bobbleheads
---
- I have a Giddyup Buttercup thats burning a hole in my stash, but if we could put one out, or perhaps make one that actually works...
---
These display cabinets need not be interact-able for other players.  I don't think this is something that we should have to lock.  They are our things and unless we could put biometrics on it, it would be insane to put this stuff out only to have someone break into the camp (which is easy) and steal 1000's of caps worth of stuff.
---
Working Nuka Cola machines that we can stock with our own bottles (nuka cola and/or other drinks).
---
As it stands right now, I have tons of things in my stash that I want to save, but my stash auto-scraps things before it chooses to break down bulk.  Can bulk be given priority, after scrap, and before unbroken items? I had 10 bulk steel, and it tried its hardest to break down my Giddyup Buttercup.  I had to remove it from my inventory, left in a bag on the ground, before i could make more ammo.  Or let us lock items from auto scrapping?
---
That'll be in the shop next week for 1800 atoms
---
bruh thats a lot of caps
---
Oh ok that makes sense! Thanks so much for the info. I'll have to do some PA respecing maybe. Something to do in the game again lol.
---
Best comment ever
---
I know, and I’m sorry
---
This is something you should have communicated 6-7 weeks ago
---
Did the surgery to switch your mouth and anus hurt?
---
&gt;You are one of the few who feels that way.
---
No, actually most people feel that way.  
---
Perhaps dismissing everyone who has the temerity to disagree with you is the wrong way to approach a thread.
---
I LOL'D AT WORK :D
---
I’m fairly certain it will be. Open demo is out now. I plan on trying it when I get home
---
It wouldn’t of been weird. It was weird when you said “This might sound weird”.
---
We all have the right to our own opinion, but the "Unofficial" patch series, for example (Skyrim and Fallout) kind of tell a different tale.  
---
  
---
There is a long list of bugs, and fixes, we've been reporting for a while, we'd love to see fixd.
---
Maybe
---
Fair enough. I was super excited and made like 8 different prototype builds on nukadragons website before the game went live while I was waiting after the last beta day. My first build was a rifle build and it's been my weakest build so far. It's super dependent on gear to be worth a damn and frankly it's so hard to farm for that I abandoned it. 
---
Moving onto my 2 hand build, I made this build before melee was widely considered to be the strongest and it was **well** before TSE was discovered. It was monstrously powerful compared to my rifle build. Once I hit 80 and had a lot of nice weapons and armor I felt pretty complete with that build so I made a heavy weapon gunner. 
---
I used a lot of the tricks I learned while making my melee toon and my heavy weapons toon is actually (despite the communities repeated dislike of it) almost as powerful as my 2 hand build. My hammer (with no buffs bonuses or anything special) can sit at 400-600 damage with a non legendary super sledge, my gatling gun was at 300-400 but shoots faster than the super sledge fires. If I got my 2 hand toons hp down to ~25% with all the perks/legendary mods/armor/mutations that multiply your damage at low HP my hammer can get well over 1k damage but I don't like to play a glass cannon when I can sit at ~50% hp, do half the damage but still one shot anything with my instigating hammer.
---
Sorry I've started rambling a bit. Moral of the story was that I spent a long time preparing my builds before the game went live and still ended up changing them as I learned about the game mechanics from actually playing. If I was still on my first toon I'd be rebuilding it too. I plan to do that one day when I'm not fully disgusted by how much weaker rifles are than other builds unless they're crit/vats. My weak ass lvl 23 ish shotgunner is as strong as my high level rifle build.
---
its cool meng
---
Because those were both multiplayer, online games as a service, right?
---
When did the duping ban waves actually start?
---
I agree. They put the last nail in the coffin, when the nerfed the guns I spent a fortune on. No Mans Sky will fill the void that Bethesda has chosen to ignore.   
---
I'm level 150, but the Note I got last week led me to the Leather Left Leg, level 1. It was marked as a quest item, and couldn't scrap it until the next time I logged in.
---
I'm actually going undercover and reporting accounts, yeah offer me those free weapons ;)
---
Same
---
Fully expected this to be the case but it's good to have it stated explicitly.
---
Nope. Clearing Sugar Grove right this moment. 
---
FYI there is a shelf in the command room with 10+ clipboards so don't skip it.
---
I'm sorry to say this, but that is not a good reason...
---
If your game is a mess of bugs and other other problems like duping exploits, unbalanced, etc. With players complaining about a new problem each day... You don't make a Atom Shop "team". You put everyone available fixing the damn game, not adding new store content... 
---
That reply doesn't excuse anything and still accentuates the users complaints, instead of fixing the game, Bethesda is wasting manpower on the store content. 
---
Just confirms where the priorities are in this game.
---
No debating we've gotten progress, and if they are still learning the engine, the learning curve can be brutal without question.
---
I can't speak for OP, but I have 2 accounts (technical one is wife's)  over the course of 8 characters I consolidate the loot on the characters In currently not playing.  This particular patch is kinda rough on the junk mule.  Need to try the bulk idea, unfortunately I know it wasn't taking out of stash when I went to make power armor.
---
Black pipboy was recently on sale
---
430atoms
---
Just wait it out if you can - another colour will go on spesh
---
The main issue people have had is the paying for skins. But seriously who care about buying skins. That’s a players decision. There is no way possible it could flop worse than 76 has at this point. 
---
Usually vendor bot phoenix in watoga 
---
 Add AP option to revolvers and you are good. 
---
I’ll fuck your mom
---
They aren’t selling ALL plans just a lot more 
---
SP or MMO is irrelevant, an error and a fix are just that.  
---
Time saved by having someone give you the exact ID of the problem and the fix helps everyone. 
---
Not soon enough. A lot of damage has already been done and evidently still continues. Hopefully they’ll get a hold on it soon. 
---
If you are level 225 and have only ever respec’t 4-5 points ever, then I would say you’ve had a pretty easy time finding a class you like, with a gun you also like, and a play style you enjoy. NOT everyone is like that my good sir. Not everyone makes as little mistakes as you do. Please understand that.
---
Remove the floor/roof above it
---
Yes it’s garbage you even need a work-around, but that’ll do it
---
Oh. Sorry mate.
---
I don't understand the people who are like "I've played 800 hours and I'm bored I hate this want my money back!" Who has that kind of time and then continues to spend more hours talking about a game they hate? Go play a game you like and let others play a game they like. Why do people hate me for liking the game?
---
Yeah the autoscrap into a generic "Empty Bottle" is an idea I hit upon in another comment. I'm playing around with it in one of my FO4 mods right now and it seems to work fine. 
---
I can corroborate OP, I know it to be fact.
---
Thing is, theres a simple fix for that. Make other places beside whitesprings/prime worth nuking.
---
Also Destiny has raids, i've been meaning to get to the new one :)
---
Based on how many damn plans I get for ivory gripped pistol I'd say this is true. 
---
They should absolutely develop a Misc Quest at the DMV and use a room with terminals that allows you to actually answer the survey,  submit answers, get an xp reward, a couple stimpacks, and maybe a 5% xp for an hour boost that can stack with well rested. 
---
It would work!!!
---
Huh I'm only like 6 agility in power armor with no stealth cards and I managed to sneak past an all out brawl between some mirelurks and a fog gulper while still unlocking the location and getting out of range. 
---
I'm on PS4. 
---
Lick a butthole, Bethesda. You should just refund everyone who spent money on your shit game and hope the good faith you get from that salvages your relationship with your playerbase. 
---
You guys keep fucking up every chance you get and at this point so many people are writing you guys off as amateurs you might as well just go bankrupt in a dark corner and sell off your IPs to someone who cares about anything besides making money.
---
If you think that introducing fixes or a patch is the same between a singleplayer game, and a multiplayer game with a client-server architecture, you're so far out of your depth that it's not even worth wasting time continuing this thread, because you clearly don't know what you're talking about.
---
If your game wasn't trash and you fixed your damn game maybe people wouldn't be able to obtain those items in the first place
---
I suspect a lot of people do not understand or consider the actual effects of armor. Things like the minigun have such a low base damage, I tend to assume it only puts out 1 point per bullet (and that minimum only as a mercy from the gods). So while the dps could be very high, until I see an enemy with literally 0 armor I am sticking to hard hitting, penetrating weapons. Also part of why those VATS critical builds are so dangerous. A linear rise in listed damage results in a geometric rise in effective (after armor) damage. Just keep stacking up those bonuses and you reach one shot territory faster than expected.
---
Message me, I know a few trading discords
---
I finished a specific mission(Brotherhood or Enclave, I forgot), but it was gifted to me that way. It was never found in the wild.
---
Umm.. stealth/ sneak broken mechanics?
---
Np mate you made everyone’s life here better 
---
Laggy and disconnected as hell, but no bugs.
---
I bet I can destroy it 
---
Also, why does it need adhesive? 
---
I believe it's called signs and letters, it contains all neon letters, numbers, and open signage.
---
Awesome. If I seem shady I'm not shading you! I have kids so sometimes mic is off.
---
all the quest rewardsa re meh versions of legendaries though...i got a level 45 somerset and level 50 anti armor western and the western does more damage.
---
Bethesda doesn’t care about the game or it’s player-base. Just look at how quiet they’ve been and unresponsive to the bugs and trash code they released the game with. I’m happy you love the game (if you do), but facts are facts, this games dying and Bethesda doesn’t really care.
---
Its from the event "mayor for a day"
---
Once the dupers are finally dealt with, will we eventually get a player market to make trading easier?  It seems you all are pushing the player economy and trading interaction (which I’m all for). Having a market of some kind where we can trade with anyone without having to be on the same server would be nice. 
---
Think of it like an eBay or stock market. It’s something done in other online games and would be nice here once the duping has been stopped.
---
I admit, I haven't read the whole post but can't artillery just dominate? I destroyed a workshops defenses before to steal the place from someone else using artillery
---
They obviously didn’t do that for radiation poisoning with the mini nuke.
---
I looked for it today, but didn't see it. Could've just missed it.
---
How did the cap stash bug get past their QA department?  It's frustrating.  With cap collector I find a stash only to find out it is empty without the search option.  If you drastically change how cap stashes work, you should also spend time making sure it works &gt;:(
---
Ha. Ha ha. Hahahaha. HAAAAHAAhaaaaa! HAAAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAAAAA!!! (and so on)
---
Every build is viable. What you want is every build to be equal which is impossible to do with a wide variety of builds you can make. Because that means you can combine build aspects to make specific builds OP. 
---
TIL Tim Cain has a Reddit account
---
I have never seen anyone charge more then 2k for it 
---
Oh I just got nostalgic. I miss the old single player experience. I'm going back to New Vegas and Fallout 4. 
---
Thanks Bethesda this puts me at ease.
---
I am so over people coming on here saying I got Banned for crafting weapons for mods.
---
We all know it's lies and if you did get banned it's because you were exploiting something.
---
Love you bgs don't be discouraged be encouraged 😊😉
---
I feel like one of the old-fashioned nights in shining armor when I run up underneath the scorchbeast and slash her belly with my fire axe.
---
Only my armor isn't shining. It's Vault Tec blue which is kind of dull blue
---
This is one of the most useless threads I've seen in awhile
---
It’s not. Both vendor bot Greg had them. I think the one in the train station (Grafton) had them too. 
---
Yes! We may have been on the same server.
---
What part of the quest are you up to?
---
You’re too late bud, I just bought it, for 150 caps and a blow job. 
---
No... I am not..   
---
We know we can't see everything, not all of it is decoded, and not everything is on our client.  
---
But when something doesn't work, and we look in the client side file, and there is an error, it's possible it's different on the server side, but it's more likely they are the same on both ends, hence why X doesn't work properly.   
---
Best example is the "Bulk" issue introduced in this update... "Scrap All" is effecting Bulk items, and comparing an older version of the Client side file, and the most recent client side file find they accidentally removed a keyword. 
---
And no one said anything about having "Us" patch anything, we've been providing a list of errors we find, fixes if they are clear...  
---
If you want to be angry, and spew hate that's fine, and your right, but I'm sorry to say your points are completely off base.
---
So.... What action if any do you take when the game spawns us into currently accessible areas (the vaults)? This is currently outside of the players control.
---
CONE HERE SO I CAN STAB YOU
---
Adenaline perk with chems is another method to get 200+ damage on weapon, obviously not every weapon in the game is capable of getting past 200 but i dont think it should be that way honestly, and pretty much everyone has some form of armor piercing in late game, some can get it through perks, you can get it through anti-armor (if you are lucky) and a lot through armor piercing mags, my mutant’s handmade rifle can three shots charred ghouls (one if it is a sneak shot) and that is fine, thats what people should be expecting, i dont know why but a lot of people have this expectation that they should be able to kill all of the small mob enemies with one shot regardless of their weapon and want to be able to kill mini-bosses within one second, its funny cuz some people with tse weapons would act like the game wasnt a challenge, now they act like everything in this game is a bullet sponge when most things are not
---
YouTubers and Reddit thread muckrakers are full of shit as usual, gotcha.
---
Thanks for the clarification, BGS.
---
Yea, its currently bugged at the moment. Or it may just be a feature bethesda made so people arent invincible at nuke zones without a hazmat suit or power armor
---
I know mine is NV just because of the replay value. Twice I've played the whole game because I wanted to replay Old World Blues. 
---
At this point I can’t remember but sometimes rose will say “still waiting on those key fragments”
---
Thank you for stating this! I was actually afraid to craft Brahmin ribeye steak because I craft around 30 at a time. Keep up the good work Developer Team!
---
I don't know what the cost is of it is on the market tbh, I'm just going off of stuff I read way back in december.
---
I just played several hours without encountering this bug. I have encountered it in the past and I had to log off and log back on to fix it
---
i know ,it was just an example 
---
Yup. 
---
It was honestly fine for me before this recent update and has been very buggy since
---
Launch nukes, do events, build up your camp, grind for legendaries, pvp with people, set up a shop, get a high bounty and kill bounty hunters, or mess with friends
---
What if I didn't have the left leg? I'd just have zero. If they don't stack, whatever. That's dumb but fine. But that's not the issue.
---
3 pieces literally don't work. If the left leg isn't equipped my radiation resistance will say 0. It's definitely not intended. That's not an issue with stacking, they're just not working individually. 
---
Thank you! I feel like the people who don't like the game yell louder and don't even want those of us who like the game to ever voice their opinions.
---
It's probably true as Bethesda posted they are keeping track on people who craft/dupe rare items in the game within a 30 day period. These include Halloween candy and ultracite scrap. 
---
So id say you got banned for exploiting by making and selling heaps of Halloween costume as it's probably rare item and as Halloween candy is on there list makes total sense. 
---
Interesting, I have 2 legendaries with rad resist I need to check this out once I get the time.
---
This comment had more thought put into it than the entirety of any combat in any fallout game.
---
Very detailed notes! Thank you.
---
Lots of C.A.M.P. updates coming soon. That's great.
---
Dang. Just got the white. The black would have been nice. Honestly the amount of atoms we get is fair compared to other games "currency" 
---
Sorry bud, it’s a bit hard to help if I don’t know what you’re supposed to be doing
---
I doubt i'll have any reponse to this given the late timeframe, but has there been any thought put into removing explosive heavies from the exceptions of Heavy Gunner? I feel them having only the single perk that was then violently nerfed into the ground is the root of the issue. We clearly have no worries of them being too strong as of now.
---
Yep, its a bug. 
---
Bwahahahahahahaha 
---
Maybe it can be destroyed but I hope not. I do not care for PVP. The base is built on a bridge which is an indestructible in game object. The base itself is made of foundations upper floors and stairs. All of my crafting stations, my bed, musical instruments and  stash box is completely surrounded by foundations with no gaps and completely covered with upper floors again with no gaps. The only way to get into that part of my base is if I remove a section of upper floor or a foundation block to get inside. Once inside I replace it preventing any other players from getting inside. 
---
Make your own story.  
---
Right now I'm rocking a Medic's explosive double barrel. Heal's nice on crits plus I'm rocking enforcer, tenderizer, and suppressor. 
---
Debuffs, buffs, and heals all in one hit. 
---
Trade ya X01 calibrated shocks for the T-51B arm.
---
&gt; adding the event timer to the map will **not** provide accurate feedback about the actual status of the event.
---
I understand this was just a typo, but based on the past 3 months this hit so close to home I almost fell out of the chair laughing.
---
You don't happen to have African royalty in your bloodline, do you? 
---
Thank you for specifying this is item specific. Us mass ammo crafters have been a little paranoid. 
---
Is everyone always so obsessed with having all things and reaching end game so quickly? I'm happy to just find new recipes, earn gold thru playing etc 
---
What's the point of buying and having everything so quickly .. Then what do you do in the game?
---
Top floor of the AMS building has at least 5 of them.
---
Do you remember what region you were in?
---
You realize you still have to dig in the code to add the items to the store. You need coders to add the items into the store and that means those coders are not looking over important code to fix bugs.
---
You do not let your model and texture guys touch the code, that is not their job.
---
So yeah, Bethesda has programmers adding the the items to the shop instead of focusing on finding and fixing game problems. Which is usually quite time intensive and requires work.
---
Well yeah. Of course the ppl coming here saying they crafted 200 outfits are liars.
---
Keep up the good work on this.
---
Pretty sure I’m on the missing link 
---
Alright well, I think artillery could still destroy it BUT the chances of pvp players having artillery in range, bent on destroying camps and finding yours is unlikely so you're pretty safe I'd say
---
Speak for yourself, my stealth sniper can kill em before they land and before I go from caution to danger usually.
---
Check to see if there are still CAMP budget bugs causing budget to be used up when it shouldn't. I see the tamed animal bug listed.  Some people report phantom wires taking up CAMP budget when they aren't scrapped prior to deleting the items they are attached to.
---
Anything to make understanding budget easier, like listed budget costs, or a view of how many of what is built in a CAMP would be nice.  Being able to delete all wires or recall all power connectors without moving CAMP, for those of us who misplace things, would be nice, but there are more pressing issues like game stability.
---
It would also be nice if there was an easier way to get an idea of what is taking up space/weight in inventory and stash. I know there is sorting by weight, but I guess I have trouble making great use of that, especially when it comes to stacks of things. For knowing which gun is heavier than which it's pretty good.
---
For issues after this last patch- I've also had issues with the weight numbers showing unencumbered but being encumbered (relogging fixes it for me), and have had similar issues with stealth/sneaking not working that other people are posting.
---
Thanks.
---
&gt;Our Support team also evaluates reported accounts on specific behavior that we know are associated with duping exploits.
---
Which is exactly what people who have claimed to have incorrectly banned have said happened w/r/t their bans. Literally nobody has come on here and said *I worked really hard for my 150,000 - 10,000,000 nukacolas/candy/ultracite but BGS banned me anyway!* 
---
So you're burying the actual issue that's been raised...why, exactly?
---
The same thing happened to me during beta. The only thing I got to work was to engage her in combat. She kicked in almost immediately and gave me the next mission. 
---
all camps are extremely easily destructible
---
I too am disappointed that I could launch 2 or 3 mini nukes into a swarm of super mutants and they didn't even bat an eye.
---
Eh, I can see maybe buy one get one 1/2 off situation but warhammers were a real thing in history, and I'm pretty sure nobody was out there trying to hit two guys with one swing on the Reg
---
Fuck that's sad 12 and a half days to get to 20k when alot of people are casual and have lives and work.
---
That is disgraceful and can't go on as someone to grind 12 and a half days to get 20k and then go buy a like 3 pa plans and all your caps are gone in 3 mins.
---
So not worth it I'm sad at this above all else Bethesda.

Bugs reports: 2 
---
Bug 1 is perk related, Description: unable to build advanced turrets with the home defense perk equipped and maxed out. It seems that the server can’t figure out if this perk is active or not, resulting in long load times for the perk to take effect. (Eventually it will work but not after a considerable amount of time.) It’s quite annoying to have to wait several minutes just to make one heavy machinegun turret! 
---
Bug 2 is turret tracking, description: turrets seem to be unable to lock onto enemies properly unless they are outright attacked. This is problematic as most defense setups don’t involve sitting your valuable turret in the open to get killed by rodents. Essentially what’ll happen is that they’ll just sit there and let enemies ravage your camp and will only shoot on occasion. From my experience it happens a lot at my camp but At workshops they seem to be working fine. The issue is mainly noticeable for everything excluding the machingun turrets (both heavy and light) which thankfully seem to always draw beads on their targets reliably. 
---
Personal note: please for the love of god buff laser and energy weaponry, you can see how weak they are even with the turrets, they’re TERRIBLE compared to various other weapons! The laser turrets can barely kill enemies leagues below their level, they have the slowest rate of fire, have steep crafting and perk requirements, and once again don’t seem to lock onto targets reliably! Why are missile turrets more accessible if they are ten times better then laser turrets, what’s the point of laser turrets being in the game if they are so laughably bad and don’t provide anything different except visual flair?!

I've seen them burrow to the second floor of a small house
---
Going to craft a stupid amount of stuff and then make an imgur link and keep everyone updated. I'll make the post in the a.m.
---
Dude, dont take it. I havent seen a single weapon cost 6000 caps so far and I've played since the BETA. He's scamming you.
---
I have a little bit. Approximately 7.56%
---
Probably
---
If a player can have tens of millions of one item on their account and the servers are still running OK, that says to me we could have more stash space quite easily? 
---
FUCK
---
Came here to post this. 
---
Cry baby wah wah

Unfortunately I don't. Was just hoping to jar someone else's memory cause I can't remember where the hell I was.
---
Man i just murdered by a guy with a bounty minding my own business and he hits me electrically charged goes off hurts him kills me leaves game and he aas offline so i couldnt chase him

One handers, that's cute. Real men use both hands. JK of course, my friend is a 1h build. I found a bloodied/+40% swing speed/+1 str civil war sword that I've been trying to get him to use over his shitty black diamond... He just refuses because "black diamond does more damage". Mofo equip this thing so you can see how much more it does.
---
I don't know when it changed, but the gas canisters were marked to manually them during the beta. I swear I had to manually scrap them a couple weeks ago.
---
I'd buy that, my rifle's durability drops incredibly slowly, even without perks.
---
They lean heavily toward game on the 'game versus simulation' scale, meant to be entertaining as opposed to realistic. This is... counterintuitive for a self-proclaimed post-apocalyptic wasteland simulator. The humorous or satirical element is most welcome, but I would like to see a bit more thought put into the itemization and combat.
---
Rethink your build.
---
Vats is strong, so is melee.
---
Seems like i might have to go and look around later then
---
Only to other players since it goes over 200 caps for vendors and we all know how it goes with that daily limit 
---
Total A for effort :D
---
This \^ works for me as well
---
I've done event alot. The trick is to not mash the button
---
I'm sorry to hear you all have had the same experience as me, and the fact it has been active since launch is just a steaming pile of shit to be honest... I have made a ticket, regarding item restoring, have any of you fellas tried this? Not getting my hopes up with Bethesda, but since it's a known bug on their side, maybe it'd be possible
---
&gt; You realize you still have to dig in the code to add the items to the store. You need coders to add the items into the store and that means those coders are not looking over important code to fix bugs.
---
They could have system for adding items without touching code. Add it into the editor with the proper tags and let an automated system do the rest.
---
Can artillery cause damage directly below upper floors or through foundations? I know artillery will destroy walls and probably other things on lower floors because some of the explosive damage probably comes from the side through the walls.
---
Clever.
---
Man, now I need links to both of these.
---
Stash limit isn't a bug though, it's a limit to maintain server performance.
---
Got mine at Watoga station 
---
So I can't find the atoms guy. Idk if he deleted it or what but its missing

Second that.

WHO HAS THE ANSWERS!?!?!?!

After the bombs have dropped, and the dust has settled...we must rebuild

When I see people crafting in their camps I'll run by an leave a bag of fertilizer an a molotov on their door step an fire off my gun into the air to get their attention to come out while I'll be hiding in the Bush nearby naked.
---
Sounds like a glitch to me. I've gotten and taken a lot of bounties, but haven't seen something like that.
---
This is facts lol. 
---
It says free states but that sounds like Enclave propaganda to me.
---
I've seen them in some areas. I've even seen some glowing ghouls that aren't ghouls, and not just regular old black and green glowing. Like they had the look of glowing ones, boils and really green, but on the figure of a regular old ghoul. And this was nowhere near Whitespring. 
---
Calibrated shock mods on any power armor will increase carry weight too.
---
Build by the meta, rebuild by the meta.
---
This sub is doomed. Baby rage. 
---
Actually, it's vault-tec proganda. They rigged the game from the start
---
It can destroy floors and stuff so it probably could hit a fair bit of your camp. They might need one or two strikes but still worthy to note
---
Agreed
---
If I scrap a deathclaw gauntlet that has the extra claw, would I then be able to craft the claw on a better gauntlet?:o
---
COME HERE SO I CAN STAB YOU
---
Thought Enclave controlled them.  Like partners in crime at the least.
---
I've used All Rise to hammer many of them to their ultracite laden graves. 
---
YOU’RE NOT MY REAL DAD, TODD!!1!
---
Yeah like, I dunno why companies seem to nerf strongest instead of buffing weaker
---
What are you buying for that many caps. I might be able to help you out for cheaper
---
I hate to break it to you, but it gets much worse. Even if you get your rad resistance value up to the thousands without power armor or hazmat suit oh, you will still take massive RADS in a blast zone. Hazmat suits and PA have a huge hidden resist value. I wasted a lot of time on RAD resistance
---
It's bugged on PC. It is literally just a basic piece leather left leg and it can't be dropped either because it's marked as a quest item. 
---
Wtf ever. Cover story,  blame game time for the short comings of your company. They are doing something wrong,  but fix your game.
---
An anti explosive combat shotgun 
---
That's what vats is for. Vats, the bullet bender.
---
Pistols are about sneak attack. You’ll have 15 agility, which is 75% bonus sneak, add the sneak perk for another 75%. 
---
I play a pistol build and shred things in seconds with sneak damage and crits. I use a non-legendary .44 pistol. 
---
Yeah, if it was Lv50, or fired faster it'd be way more OP. As it is, there's a reason I call it my "last resort" gun for emergencies, l
---
How much you got?
---
Still haven’t gotten over your ban yet? 
---
I spent close to 613 hours in fo76 (no life, whatever) and I can say, objectively, that it is not that great of a game. I tried really hard to love it but with each passing day since I stopped playing about 2 weeks ago I notice more and more the shortcomings it has and lack of desire to go back to it. There is no excuse Bethesda has at this point for the mountains of fuckups they keep making and they’re getting to the point that their reputation as a major-league developer is probably never going to recover. It really makes you wonder if their plan is to kill off the Fallout IP which is a shame because although I love TES, I’ve always preferred the post-nuke landscape of the Fallout games. It would be sad, but at this point I’d prefer it just die instead of continually being dragged through the mud by BGS.
---
1.5k but I have a plan at the moment to gather a few more with some alts. But that’ll take way too long
---
Go home kid.
---
Concerning: 
---
**Messaged that “Lack Required Materials” but materials list shows that all materials are available.
---
STATUS: We’re aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in the next patch. ​**
---
This seems to be caused by the material check using the stash, but the actual construction check only uses your character's inventory. 
---
So a quick work around for players is to take the necessary materials out of stash.
---
Well I currently have 500 caps at the moment so I'm always down to trade for both if you're available, GT - ryannewbz
---
Off topic but great name
---
They know about the bugs.  The HAVE acknowledged it. You had a bad time like thousands of others. No one cares. 
---
Not enclave and I haven't heard of Vault Tec controlling them. I thought it was made from the government.
---
Started a new toon and took them to watoga since the patch, vendor had no caps available for me to sell anything to them on a brand new toon, zero.
---
So I really don't know what's going on with this and I really wish they would document it clearly, like all the other crap in the game.
---
Ugh. Spoiler tag pls!
---
Limit yourself. I also think the game is stale at some point so I restarted with some RP type rules.
---
-No VATS unless I absolutely have to.
---
-No PA
---
-No hoarding items. Pickup only what I need and will use
---
-Seldom fast travel
---
-Take my time doing everything and going everywhere
---
-Play solo
---
-play high ( if you're into that )
---
Some of the random things I do to keep it interesting.
---
Baby rage. Holy shit. 
---
You point remains intact, but your math is off in my particular situation.
---
First off...
---
the HP for a primus is roughly 750 and resistance is ~135 last I checked.
---
My perks break down like this:
---
20% basic pistol
---
20% expert pistol perk
---
20% master pistol perk
---
10% basic rifle perk
---
10% expert rifle perk
---
10% master rifle perk
---
15% bloody mess
---
**Some damage is not additive**
---
    Rifle perks added together are
---
    x1.3
---
   Pistol perks added together are
---
   x1.6
---
   ((91*1.3)*1.6) = ~189
---
and our result is....
---
https://imgur.com/a/7Azuxh4
---
IF we were using your additive values, I'd only be somewhere in in the 172 range, which is lower.
---
But I haven't factored in Bloody Mess, which is it's OWN spell, which is 
---
    x1.15
---
    188*1.15 = 216
---
Which is as expected, where we end up.
---
https://imgur.com/a/Pqa423s
---
If the values were additive, we'd only be at 186.
---
And futher... Adrenaline is up to a x1.60 which is also *it's* own spell so it's instead multiplicative.
---
so now we're at 345 damage at max stacks
---
and finally, the cherry on top is Gun Fu which is x1.1 which also *it's own spell*
---
so in VATS, my damage numbers are looking more like 379.
---
And further, Concentrated fire is a x1.15 multiplier while using VATS as well.
---
So we're at 435 at this point.
---
And headshots are x2, so double the whole thing to 871.
---
If I was only doing 200 damage, it'd take a lot more than 1 shot.
---
Hope this helps
---
Wait.  This is established lore isn’t it?
---
Don't try this on PC. The item will be a basic leather left leg, the misc quest dissapears without giving any reward, and it's extra weight that can't even be dropped because it's marked as a quest item. You wont be rid of it til you log off. This was JUST tried on PC today by me. 
---
Have any requests actually gotten in?
---
Very. Brief.
---
&gt; and the servers are still running OK,
---
Since when?
---
I don't know if they stop being available at a certain point but as stated, you have reach a certain level before they become available.
---
Piss off,  I don't like the dupers as much as the rest.  But fix the game.and stop blaming dupers for everything. 
---
[Sometimes you gotta take the fight to them.](https://i.imgur.com/VraTstI.gifv)
---
Claim a workshop, build a maze, get a bounty, hide in the maze
---
Oh, I don't doubt the practical reason.  I was just wondering what the quantity was that triggered the automated ban.
---
Right now itd turn into a flame fest, I'm not sure they do it. 
---
Thanks! Shit4Brains was taken 😂
---
After “hotfix” the (known) tag is applied to plans now.  But honestly I don’t follow the patch notes I just play and find it out then.
---
I’ve noticed the same thing 
---
So basically those other two people that made those threads earlier on here did some bad stuff?  Is that the long and short of it?
---
I never believed people who say they got banned for just crafting  stuff.  IMO, the dupers flew into a rage after Bethesda cracked down on duping and their idea of striking back was spreading lies an misinformation. 
---
Full rifle/melee build, my rifles last longer than anything else I own.
---
lol
---
https://youtu.be/YI5BocW_r4U meanwhile, on my character
---
Please oh god please apply that logic to literally anything else in the real world. I wait to see you show up on youtube.
---
You fast travel out of there because unlike in previous games you can still fast travel while inside buildings. 
---
Coincidentally after the last nerf that’s how the rest of us feel too 
---
It's probably all the hoarders dropping their 5k lbs of junk
---
I run the same build. I melt everything with a non-legendary 10mm, or even a pipe pistol if I need to use another ammo type for a while. Since most of the damage is sneak and crits it’s very versatile, I can run silenced rifles or shotguns if I’m feeling saucy.
---
lmao
---
No. Bethesda just posted indicating ppl that are being banned accrue 150k items on 30 days.
---
So anyone on here saying they got banned for nothing are liars
---
im launching one at the SBQ right now GT: MexicanBeast159 ;) 
---
fortnite is literally garbage and boring to play and is literally owned by a company in china that use's it to brain wash an entire generation. Overwatch did not come out 2 years ago. They have no added anything except skins. So in that regard so has fo76. RDR2 has been out even longer then fo76 and has added nothing but gun rush. which is a battle royale. which you were just bitching about. also destiny 2 was hated on for almost a year and a half before the third expansion came out and people actually started liking the series again because of random rolls. You make stupid points dude.
---
Like yours as well👍🏻
---
SWEET
---
By later in the year do you mean months?
---
Agreed. I was hoping Bethesda would improve upon this type of system.
---
By later in the year do you mean several months?
---
I can't imagine Wildstar having so many people outside of the game actually "hating" it.  I can already see the Fallout 76 videos complaining about bethesda censoring the public outrage when they get blocked on Twitch or banned from the chat.
---
They gonna knee Cap you.. Eh? Ehhh?
---
That is a very good possibility that I didn't think of. 
---
After this, there won't be a Fallout 5. This franchise is dead, just like Mass Effect after Andromeda. 
---
Hahahahha
---
Cause in no way would a gaming company lie to its user base or promise a product then not deliver right? 
---
This clarification was necessary, thanks!
---
They're liars?
---
Its over 30 days, they crafted recently, it's not related.
---
The place you're thinking of is called an Auction House. 
---
Ill run interferance.
---
It was too small at launch. That's what I meant. My bad. 
---
Dropping extra ammo and plans is commonplace. I do it all the time if I get ammo I dont use or duplicate plans. 
---
I think dupers were more focused on rare items and weapons. So you should be fine. 
---
upvote for you! I was totally unaware of this and am now thoroughly disappointed 
---
You create this account just to cry?
---
Bold strategy Cotton.
---
I really hope a natural economy will recover, but I have my doubts. Yesterday I got a bunch of hate for trying to offload a couple of 1 * legendaries. Seems like so-called and Traders are only interested in god tier equipment.
---
Play a different game. 
---
Also killing floor 2
---
Look in the cash register at train station vendors... i usually drop my extra plans, meds or junk 
---
Hello, 911?  I'd like to report a murder.
---
I don’t want just auctions. I want a commodity trading system like the stock market where we can buy/sell crafting supplies. We can’t set our limit prices like when buying/selling stock or we can just buy/sell at the current market price. 
---
Too much landscape 
---
Mobs only at locations 
---
Yeah you're probably right. It's just been more frequent than before for me, so it made me wonder a bit. 
---
Watoga spawns 4 sets of power armor. If you just check those a couple days in a row you can get a full set. 
---
TSE was absolutely a problem. No legendary effect combination should give you 6x damage.
---
Guns in general doing not enough damage, and the general sponginess of high level enemies, is a separate problem that led to the popularity of TSE. 
---
It’s basically all they can offload easily and the new weight cap makes hoarding stuff harder. 
---
With the newest patch if you contract the radworms disease and have marsupial it triggers you being able to jump higher as if strange in numbers perk card, and unlimited sprinting.
---
Because the stories are true; people are loosing all of their Bethesda games, games they've had for up to 17 YEARS, because they crafted too fast.
---
Yeah, I went into a lot of Queen's fights with dead man sprinting before I actually tested all these things with my buddies so I was pretty bummed too. On the bright side now you have some free perk/mod slots.
---
To each his own. 
---
Something I discovered today about this bug: when I'm in CAUTION all the time, my regenerating armor thinks I'm still in combat and doesn't regenerate my health. Not happy.
---
a lot of people carried a lot of extra stuff on them then after the patch they had to drop most of it since anyone more than 1500 lbs over their limit ended up being immobile and useless. so you are likely finding the stuff they dropped.
---
\&gt; I hate crafting ammo non stop.
---
Been saying this since the beginning. The game Bethesda has created is quite niche due to the survival / scavenging elements. I dunno about you but I don't particularly enjoy having to eat and drink either. I don't particularly enjoy repairing my gear. These are all just chores after surviving the first ten levels and they should have designed the game so that these needs go away by the time you hit level 50 and materials are only farmed for crafting and base building rather than maintenance.
---
Will do! 
---
I understand.
---
Of all the poorly designed enemies, these are the worst. They have 2 flying attacks, spam the sonic blast sending the frame rate into the shitter, and almost never land. All this is agitated by the fact that their loot is garbage and laughable considering how much of a pain in the ass they are to kill. 
---
Fuck scorchbeasts.
---
It's called truth in advertising thanks
---
This is such a lazy jab at a persons character. It’s so annoying reading this whenever someone can’t think of a good insult. It’s on-par with calling someone “kid” when they out argue you and you have nothing left in your arsenal. Shameful.
---
Suppose it's true, Mass crafting isn't duping or exploiting. This would be plain won't and fucked up.  
---
We have no way of knowing though.
---
And we should believe this why, exactly? People are claiming you've taken back potentially hundreds of dollars worth of software with little to no justification, and no possibility of getting it back. Of course you're going to deny it. Why should we believe you? 
---
Then why does it weigh 10 lbs when not actively worn?
---
This a dumb argument in favor of bad design decisions. 
---
***If you build it, they shall come.***
---
Not true
---
I been playing on the Xbox One X in 4k hdr. I seen a little framerate drop and some blur even with motion blur off. Might play it on my 1080p 1 ms Monitor game is beautiful.
---
My only question for every AMA:  "What the hell were you thinking when you did X" where X is literally everything.
---
can you show us a picture of it? 
---
Might get banned. I would rather be safe than sorry man
---
Are you ps4? I’ve got time if you need assistance 
---
I’ll be on in. A bt I’ll add you 
---
Easily. I wouldn't loot any containers, or dead mobs that you didn't personal kill, if I were you.
---
Was hoping I read Leather Far Right Leg
---
I can imagine. Other than the bugs, is the game still fun? I assume you’ve picked quite a few legendary weapons by now and have loads of caps. 
---
Lmao.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning
---
Nah I ran around hiding legendaries last week just to blow peoples minds 😂
---
Thank you for clarifying my exact suspicions: that your bans were due to exploits, duping and cheating and not as a result of 20 boards they created like some histrionic cheating crybabies are pretending.
---
Is there any way your team could publicly respond to any poster who claims they were banned for other reasons, and then disclose what the real reason specific to that poster is?  
---
I believe that would serve to quell the duping cheater brigade campaign 
---
So all those other issues that people were shouting 'This is fake news' are true, since Bethesda seems to be setting the record straight.
---
I do have a lot of caps..a lot of weapons and gear. I got who suit of the holy Unyielding Assassin 3Star Heavy Combat Armor that everybody wants.
---
Which challenges can you do on multiple characters? I've made new characters and everything but level up for perk packs is already shadowed to show I've completed it.
---
Bethesda whipping out the VATS to pinpoint target the cheaters who then lie about their cheating.
---
Better idea: Have all the players on the server's shop inventories available from one vendor. The vendor could then charge a tax on every item sold.
---
If you find thousands of a single item laying around it would be wise to just walk away.
---
Fucking epic.
---
(They won't, they don't care about their customers obviously)
---
nukes are less popular since the patch. SBQ require a lot of ammo and the reward is terrible.  I see nukes as people still set them off but since the patch have not seen more than 5 people in any nuke zone.
---
I thought Melee was totally OP and broken and everything else needed to be buffed to be as good as melee because it was so much better than everything else
---
I have a question though - when you change out the doorway walls for solid walls, you have some way to switch them without removing/replacing. How on earth do you do that?
---
Life's a piece of shit,
---
When you look at it.
---
Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true.
---
You'll see it's all a show.
---
Keep 'em laughing as you go.
---
Just remember that the last laugh is on you.
---
Why don't you abandon the game?  I'm gonna be pissed if they shut down the game because ppl like you don't like it.  Go play something else.  I'm aaaaaaactually enjoying it. 
---
At this point I figure they will just add fattys and missiles to the heavy guns. Seems like the laziest route. They do need to do something. To me, the mininuke is like the signature weapon of fallout and here it's pathetic. I want that feeling like when I took down that behemoth in front of GNR. 
---
Lol they’ve been doing this for the entirety of the game. Not gonna lie I’ve finessed some ammo out of their services a few times
---
Like the other guy, I was unaware of this. Useful info!
---
Can't waste to scatter my 250 waste antiseptic around
---
Stuff stashed in overseers caches or are we talking paper bags?  I, like many, drop off garbage from my inventory into the caches for lower level guys because the items are more permanent than the short lived bag. I’ll drop off garbage plans and hundreds, or thousands, of fusion cells, plasma cartridges, .38 ammo, etc to shed weight.  These items aren’t duped, just accumulated in my inventory from pickups and they’re not being used. 
---
That said, if you find something like 10k pieces of circuits or something rare, that’s a different story.  
---
You are not alone, I got squished today while out for a stroll.....
---
I'd kind of rather they focus on addressing the issues in the game vs the issues in the fanbase. Fix the former and the latter will heal itself.
---
Damn these birds!
---
When it reaches the familial tidal ponds, it gets to spawn. Very few have witnessed such a miraculous event.
---
This video begs for David Attenborough voiceovers.
---
I didn't read that as we banned them because somebody thought they had too much of something, but that it led them to look into other details that got them banned.  Like if you reported a car for driving crazy and they got pulled over covered in blood and then they found bodies at their house.
---
Join a group of like 12 or so lvl 70-160 players and go nuts.
---
And why do you automatically disbelieve the people who were banned, while taking Bethesda at their word? Neither has provided any evidence, just "their word". As far as I'm concerned, this issue is up in the air entirely until I see some hard data from one side or the other.
---
Guys fastest/easiest money maker for me after level 10, go to power plant roof get level 10 hazmat suit.  Go to train station out side Whitesprings.  Server hop till you get a nuke, pick up active flux with green thumb.  It usually takes me 15 mins to get 1400 in flux.
---
The way a majority of AH's work is you can set a "buyout" price and a "bidding" price. If the person really wants it. Buy it for the buyout price, which is normally higher. Or they can fight for it as a bid. So I'd sell a plan for 1200 buyout or starting bid 900. The CMP (current market price) will slowly start to level out once duping stops and once the game isn't broke. 
---
When your computer says "no."
---
God forbid people expect NV to be the standard after its release. Bethesda just continually shows they’re incompetent and lazy game developers compared the Obisdian every chance they get. Real mystery why people shit on them and expect better with the resources they have available. With everything Obsidian introduced with NV, BGS has maybe retained .05% of it and continues to ignore what the community asks them for. But let’s just keep apologizing for them and ignore the facts
---
I could've sworn you couldn't auto-scrap assaultron heads. I know there are some items (baseballs for example) that won't auto-scrap.
---
More like dupers still have tons of inventory and are running fire sales before their mules and all linked accounts get banned.
---
Is that a question?
---
Pretty cool. I have one legendary weapon, a mutated pump shotgun. It’s somewhat useless since I’m not mutated but it’s the highest level shotgun I own. Well, hopefully you’ll come back to the game. Seems as though you’ve sunk quite a bit of time into it. I have no doubt that Bethesda will right the ship given enough time.
---
I'm sure they're checking reddit it's not like they're working 
---
That’s a good one as well
---
Oh man, so I've tested this. Went all the way to 42 intelligence. Same base condition length as 20 int when crafting the X-01... This sucks. I was waiting with most crafting until I can max intelligence. Was a huge waste of time... Over-condition I just do via the 200% repair perk, so there's really no point to wait with anything. Oh well... At least I can stop worrying about crafting. 
---
Just kill seventy-four MILLION super mutants. Easy Peasy.
---
Agreed. Pictures! Pictures! Pictures!
---
It is the same thing... When/when you buy a serum you buy the recipe which you have to learn.. THE EXACT SAME SERUM in white spring bunker went from 3800 to 19000 with hard bargain 3.... No more 3850
---
That's a nice clarification.  I had the gut feeling those people making threads about being unfairly banned for just crafting were bullshit and just hoping to stir more shit up cause they salty about getting busted.
---
I was getting pretty worried, I had farmed well over 150 tatos. Thought for sure I was getting banned, luckily they went bad very quickly. I just dumped them in the forest. Hope nobody saw me.........
---
Alright so level 43 isn’t a good idea

That's all fine, I just want +25 rad resist to give me +25 rad resist.

Join a party with low levels and let them go on their merry way completing quests. You get massive caps when they complete quests.

They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway. 
---
That’s genius!
---
I well wait and see and play some other games.
---
You seem to be taking this awfully personally...  And yes, I know about regression testing, and how previous bugs can creep in.  I also know the vast majority of it can be prevented, with diligent testing, and double checking your work after merges. 
---
Glad that tse got gutted there was 4 or 6 times that i went into fisure prime and they killed the scorched in 30sec and not even landed once
---
That does not always work I have logged out multiple times and the bitch is still lurking over me! I hid in a bus the other night for 30 minutes....
---
often feels like the majority of users on this sub have literally never played an online game before. 99% of posts where some guy is going "i GOT WRONGFULLY BANNED. I DID NOTHING" are lies. There was even a post the other day on /r/wow about a guy getting falsely banned from all blizzard games, community had an uproar but blizzard came in and said he was bullshitting the entire time and his ban was justified.
---
Everyone here needs to stop getting outraged.
---
Certainly possible, but it's weird for BGS to come out and say 'People are claiming they were banned for X. That's BS, because we ban people for Y and Z, which are obviously impossible to do without cheating. Also, we sometimes ban for X.'
---
Yeah I wish I'd kept that gatling plasma... *sigh* oh well I'll find another one one day. Right now I'm looking for a 2 or 3 star cryolater. I saw someone using it on the SBQ and it was just flat out hilarious how she takes off in slow mo all frozen, brilliant fun
---
Can we please have the ability to remap hold breath from left alt to another key! Its so annoying to use that I don’t use scopes at all.
---
I get your point. Gaming is mostly just enjoyment for me indeed. Besides a few exceptions where some games lets you make difficult decisions. They also give me inspiration for my job (3D animation).
---
I get that books more often contain lessons that you can use for your own life. Although I also believe many books are just for enjoyment. I honestly don't really read that much novels (I should though) but the books that I do read often don't really contain life lessons. (mostly horror haha). Books for sure help me also to get inspiration. They do a better job at that than games do actually. It's one of the reasons I want and should read more books.
---
Just wanted to clearify your previous statement, but I understand your point now :)
---
I don't get how people are having such a hard time getting ammo. Crafting it seems to work fine for me.
---
His character just couldn’t decipher the pantomime and emoji for making boards super powerful. 
---
Thanks for the good fight.
---
Lol, any of us that know what we are doing know how to get past their little duping audit they perform, your reporting accomplishes nothing :)
---
Yes ps4. And it's a cosmetic door that opens differently.  Need to be able to enter and exit from the base.
---
No one should be shunning your wares there are people that need what you have but don’t shun 3 star exotic merchants either lol just coexist 
---
No. The long and short of it is we have no idea who's telling us the truth, and who's lying through their teeth. 
---
Yep lost 2 legendary weapons last night again to this stupid bug.....
---
Trash cans at stations always have extra crap
---
I cheated anf used a pedestal switch near a window, I could activate it from outside through the shutters.
---
Tell me lies.  Tell me sweet little lies.
---
I have a switch on the outside and inside, both connections wired up seperately, and I have to follow these steps for things
---
&gt;Press switch 1 to open door
---
&gt;walk inside and press switch 2 to keep the door open when switch 1 is turned off
---
&gt;walks outside and turns off switch
---
&gt;walks back inside and hits switch 2, causing the door to close
---
To make this work going from inside to out, follow the same steps, but of course, inside becomes out and vice versa
---
Salty much?
---
I'm simply pointing out that one industry is being held to a different standard than another.  Software development is software development regardless of the product.
---
 
---
VERY HELPFUL, THANKS
---
Their wording seems suspicious though. 
---
Majority. So there are some people that are not ban because of that and might be crafting too fast. Because tbh this is not the first case I heard that if you craft too fast you got banned and those incidents are not from reddit but from other foreign countries and I know them thru chat room but I know they don’t bullshit. 
---
Melee guys......where you at?
---
Not only do y'all not shoot the queen down but y'all don't launch nukes either?
---
LOL......what a disaster.
---
You would think if a legendary pipe revolver existed, somebody would have found one by now
---
Your not paying for the event, your paying to travel.
---
Donzo
---
But I mean, on the flip side, at lvl 118 I'm not really interested in 1* anything. I would rather a vendor (for my needs) *only* sell 3* items.
---
I've been saving up but I don't know who I want to spend my atoms on. It's a struggle.
---
So you're willing to believe them, but not Bethesda official statement?  Lol. Tight logic. 
---
I’m guessing you’ve never traded stocks using limit orders.  Basically it’s a limit to how low you’ll sell for or how high you’ll buy for.  
---
I don’t want to just have an auction system for unique items like you describe, but a commodities market for basic crafting needs as well.  A player should be able to go with his 30 bulked steel and say I want to sell it for the current market price. If there’s another playing who has a buy order in that the sell price meets, the trade is completed. Players could set limit orders like buying/selling real stocks but for basic commodities in the game. This system could be limited to aid and junk, possibly ammo if fractional cap values are allowed. 
---
of course man, i’m gonna launch another one in a bit so stick around 
---
Reported could be read to mean that, or to mean anything auto-flagged by their systems. As they weren't clear, it's impossible to be sure.
---
u/Nthanel didn't die, they were MURDERED
---
I do this to and have caught myself trying to loot an enemy before it's dead a few times lol
---
"support team evaluates" means manually. People claiming they crafted gamma guns too quickly and immediately were banned are full of it.
---
Good riddance to everyone banned. I'm confident they deserved it.
---
idk why people make such low effort troll posts
---
Ya I was.
---
Ah, business as usually then.  Carry on internet.
---
On the flip side, *because* the market is flooded with illicit *** legendaries, they're cheap enough that the masses can afford them.  If I can get that double-shot armor-piercing executioner's handmade for 2500 caps, why should I bother with your shitty 1-star for 500?
---
Just as soon as Todd’s and Pete’s whereabouts are discovered.
---
Carry weight fluctuates wildly.  But if I hop severs wearing Excavator Power Armor I get 100 free carry on top of the 100 bonus.  if I hop out of my power armor at any time I lose the 100 extra weight bonus.
---
Having this extra carry weight helps greatly.  Can't wait for you to take it away.
---
Also maybe add more world bosses that require several players to beat a a new event.  Perhaps a new higher level of legendary or add larger suped up versions of the biggest monsters.  Maybe a Mega Deathclaw or Ultra Behemoth as random world encounters that alert the entire server when they appear.  Think of it like a warm up battle for the ScorchQueen.  Just a thought.
---
Hahahahah
---
Yeah I can relate. I just think if someone calls themselves a traitor they should be willing to take my one star and sell it to a lower level. Maybe I'm Wrong
---
Almost everything in this game is bad
---
This is so wrong...
---
Here's a non visual bug for ya! I cannot buy or sell anything to vendors. It says I'm over weight when I am not. My total stash and character was at 850 and no sale. I dropped a bunch of stuff trying to get low enough to sell something. It didn't work. Then I got disconnected and lost all my stuff. Not counting the several thousand in caps I have lost due to this issue. Starting to get real pissed on this one.
---
This exactly. In another post someone makes a claim that people are hardly using these legendary effects anymore. Besides that I have no idea how they could possibly know that people are hardly using them since no proof / evidence was offered, I'm thinking "WHY?" For pure damage these are still among the best unless you are completely changing not only your gun but your build as well (e.g. going from rifles to unarmed).
---
The last patch fixed the merchants to sell all of their available plans at all times regardless of level
---
hope you have a better one now! 
---
As random said, remove the roof. Alternately you can try a higher ceiling (angled instead of flat) or make the walls stacked so you don't get this problem as often. You can sometimes put the roof back after you wire btw.  
---
Why dose it say *Vote* Instead of showing the number of upvotes this post has received?
---
Hmm, people spreading lies on this subreddit to make things seem worse than they are. Who would have guessed such a thing could ever happen? This has totally never been proven to be the case before!
---
I didn’t know the gun was loaded and I’m so sorry my friend. I didn’t know the gun was loaded and I’ll never never do it again. 
---
That has not been my experience. 
---
Mine are pipe revolvers 
---
Lets be honest. If you don't like the game don't play it, d5ont follow the subreddit.
---
It is the same as going to your favorite restaurant, then find out they make something on their new menu wrong, but your best friend likes it anyway. Instead of going "nah its not for me" you scream at the manager. Then next week you order the same damn thing and yell at the manager again. 
---
Long story short, it doesn't matter how much you don't like it, someone else may. 
---
Docstockton?
---
Yeah, pretty much. It's like the hundreds of daily "I got VAC banned but I didn't cheat?!?!?!" threads on the CS:GO forums. 
---
Send a ticket, this is not the place to get your refund
---
Hey look at that! Bethesda just officially posted (on the front page) and called those ban claims “unequivocally false”. It’s almost like people never learn and keep falling for this nonsense without even looking for or waiting for proof. 
---
You think server hopping Whitesprings is an intended game mechanic? You think server hopping to collect items is an intended game design? Simple logic. They called what people were doing with caps stashes an exploit. So logically if you do that same thing for anything you are exploiting. Do you know the meaning of the word exploit? Feel free to use a dictionary. And I decide when the conversation is over. Now it's over. Jackass.
---
It makes sense. 
---
if only your parents had been fixed....
---
&gt; "support team evaluates" means manually. 
---
You must be correct, given the level of care and attentiveness BGS has put into all other aspects of their work on 76.
---
I'm agnostic about whether the OPs of these recent threads are full of shit or not, agree with you 100% on banning dupers/exploiters, and having never duped, bought anything from another player, or collected a big bag full of obviously duped stuff, I've got no personal stake in the issue. 
---
But taking anyone at their word doesn't come naturally to me, much less an entity as...unreliable...as BGS has been lately. Doubly so when their statement is highly detailed on an issue that hasn't really been raised, while extremely vague on the issue that *was* raised.
---
Because the people claiming they were banned for crafting to fast were likely dupers salty about their ban, wanting to get back at Bethesda by using an already upset fanbase against them . 
---
Why would a person admit they had 150k+ of an item? It makes more sense to spread a false narrative to garner support and sympathy. 
---
Cuz I'll sell it to you for a hundred, and there's a level forty-five somewhere that would buy it from you at a profit.
---
What's so wrong with that
---
Nah. I know his name shy of precise spelling, but don't wanna brush witch hunting.
---
" ...   However, we want to reassure players that are playing the game as intended – players who craft a lot, or collect a lot of junk, or saving up to open a store – to have full confidence that we are not deactivating accounts that belong to people playing the game normally.  ..."
---
With the stash and carry limit, what store? How does one collect a lot of junk? Simply nonsense cap on the carry weight and stash limit. 
---
"...  accounts with as few as 150,000 ..." Raise the carry weight and stash limit to 150k then. Identify the threshold that separates real players who collect junk and keeps everything VS the dupers, not kill the trading market or the passion of those like myself who loves to collect and save junk and what not.
---
In key to the past and missing link quest I Was stuck in a loop right at the point of giving rise the holo tapes to advance to the next step. Same dialogue for a few days and could not figure it out. For some reason I decided to go back into my pip big and activate the missing link to track and it finally advanced to the next dialogue and step. I don't know how relevant that is but make sure both quests are actively tracking in the pipboy. Just an observation try it out. 
---
It’s impossible to attack her now. They must’ve changed that.
---
&gt; Why would a company admit they had run a poorly designed, over-inclusive banning script? It makes more sense to spread a false narrative to garner support and sympathy.
---
Someone just came through and sold me them, sorry! 
---
The long and short if it is that this community gets off on raging at Bethesda. So much so that they don’t even pretend to attempt to get a drop of proof before absolutely losing their shit. 
---
(Types console command to get in vault)
---
(Yells in mike)Fuck it spawned me here, now I am trapped and must explore for an exit. 
---
Damn, that sucks. 
---
I did a fair amount of hopping as well. Nada. 
---
You should add your preferred platform so people can better respond. 
---
They can't tell unless you do it over and over. They won't be punishing anyone for it either. It's their poor game design that causes people to server hop. I'm just pointing out their logical inconsistency.
---
I don't know what to tell you.  It's best to show you, I guess.
---
I just went and checked the Enclave Science Wing with my CHA2 and Hard Bargain 1 melee character:

Do you now see how you're mixing up the ~3800 SERUMS with the ~19000 RECIPES?
---
What would Bethesda have to gain from knowingly wrongfully banning players? I know we don’t like them much these days, but come on. Now what would a sour cheater have to gain from spreading lies? Well not much either but I imagine it’s some sort of attempt at revenge and fuel more hate. 
---
So everyone knowa there is an invisible ace to connect a wire on the inside of the garage door.... You can connect a switch to it to open the door....
---
Oops..Xbox one
---
Its not a bug, its a feature! (No irony)
---
No, because that lvl 45 can buy the same *** I can for the same amount.  
---
In a world where Ferraris cost $25k and perfectly good beaters fat handed out for free, nobody's buying Fords.  That's where the FO76 economy is right now.
---
Oddly enough I've never had issues with that.  I found if I sneak too him, then get his attention and sneak again he would land them I'd punch him 5-6 times and he'd die
---
I did it today at lvl 16. A couple of levels ago, I got a rad suit from Poseidon and trecked over the mountains to Watoga. So today I just fast traveled to Watoga and ran into battle with my 10mm and ski sword. I probably died 30 times and used about 400 rounds of 10mm. I got excellent loot when the queen died.
---
Sooo... they are lying, or you are lying. I gotta chose carefully.
---
I mean, if you apply even the most basic logic to this it’s hard to imagine Bethesda is lying. Supposedly people were banned for “totally only crafting like 20 things or ammo”. Yet less than a handful of people made these claims. Does that seem believable to you? That only a few people got banned when basically everyone crafts large amounts of items? Why would Bethesda want to ban legit players? Common sense is your friend. Try it. 
---
so you want to have people do max damage with every weapon in the game with one build....   Please Bet never do this..... 
---
Ohhhhh, had to go to insulting directly.  No valid opinion.  So,  I will go there.  Go suck you thumb in your safe space.  Pansy boy.
---
Yea why would they post all their hot fixes and updates either!?  When they could just lie and fix it in secret !! Clearly the random posters with literally  no proof or credibility are 100% telling the truth and Bethesda is out to get us! ! ! -puts on tinfoil hat - yessss it all makes sense now! 
---
Lmao. My thoughts exactly. I seem to have less connection issues than most people but calling the servers stable is an unbelievable stretch of the imagination. 
---
They're great games, the circlejerks around them however are probably some of the worst there are.
---
* Platform: Xbox One
---
* Username: Marvin12Mcm
---
* Bug: I am unable to craft some weapons and armor even though I have enough material and the right perk cards. I first noticed it while crafting Leather Armor and Lever guns. I am only allowed to craft those items when I have an excess of materials. For example, an item requires 2 screws but I need to have almost 10+ in my inventory to craft it, I can never have a exact amount I always need up to 5 times as much. I don't know if it's applies to all materials since I can craft drugs, healing items, and ammo with the exact amount with no issue. 
---
“It’s not how many want it” *
---
Use a switch, connect it to the garage then on the inside, use a terminal connect it to the switch.
---
An excellent point to consider. I would also be very interested in knowing for sure the answer to that question. I have seen some rumblings about a roadmap after people began asking for one and now people are asking for AMAs, so hopefully the chance will arise for us to ask questions like this and get a good answer.
---
&gt;next stable release

hahahah.. I see what you did there.

Common sense? A basic grasp of reality? Take your pick.

Can you start including this with all bans issued by you?

My main is melee. I don’t care about the TSE nerf. So no, not a “typical TSE response.” You should stop projecting. I’m sorry you have to get good instead of spamming OP nonsense. 
---
Pretty good analogy. So do you think Fords and Chevys will ever recover market value? Keep in mind there's some chunk of the playing population that has no awareness of the Market outside of the people they bump into in game.
---
I could have written this post! I too have a full time job kids etc. I end up spending my time running my in game bed and breakfast and an adhesive farm. Simple tasks but it seems to keep my friends and I entertained and busy.
---
This should be the difference between one hand and two hand melee weapons. One handed weapons only hit one target but have superior single target DPS. Two hand weapons should hit everything in a frontal cone.
---
Lol. ;) you too bud .
---
makes it slightly more obnoxious, any ground is a victory to me.
---
If you're on PC, I still have that quest on my log and get you civil unrest at max level

Is the negative result of Egg Head towards a melee character the STR&gt;-1 would that make much of a difference, I have Scaly Skin, Twisted Muscles and have just obtained Egg Head from a high rad near death experience. Wondering if I should RadX and start again?
---
Display Items in C.A.M.P. as décor 
---
For me weapons and armour would be top. Just like in Fallout 4, have weapon racks and mannequins. 
---
Also, magazine racks and some kind of bobblehead display.  I know they are used when you use them but maybe some way around it so you can ten use it as a display model.
---
It seems that you have angered the Enclave
---
Go so to do uranium fever and pick up literally everything at scrap it. All the shotguns, mole Gauntlets, everything. I come out with 400 steel. Also I can give you ammo when I get home :) gt rickyjameson. Message me and I'll hop on when I'm home :)
---
Should just sell the entire Fallout IP to someone who would actually take care of it. It seems pretty obvious BGS is trying to kill it off so why not just make a final couple million off of it and pass the buck? As long as it isn’t sold to someone who would make it an exclusive to one gaming device I’d be ok with that
---
Yeah I don't think you read the whole post. That or you figured out how to get +15 to all your SPECIAL with a finite number of points.

True, but I had a bad experience with hotloads and a .30-06 when I was 13 and to this day 30 years later, I still have not shot another .30-06. My grandfather was teaching me a lesson about the proper position when using a scope, and I had gotten too comfortable using sand bags at the range to help with recoil so he built a new rifle that was supposed to be mine, we went to the range, he sent a few down, then loaded 3 rounds all had a red mark on them. I wasn't really paying attention, except that it was my turn to play with the new rifle. I sit down, get into my position, and before I sent the first round, he asked if I was in the proper position for using the scope since I was not using sand bags. I said I was fine. I found my mark, took a couple of breaths then just as I exhaled I gently applied pressure to the trigger and BOOM. That bitch jumped back and bit in the right eye. I was bleeding like a stuck pig where it got me above the eyebrow. My grandfather I swear pissed his pants he was laughing so hard. Everyone at the range seemed to be in on the joke as they were all laughing at me. I was pissed. I never had a rifle jump on ke like that. At that point I had shot .30-30, .30-06, .308, 7mm mauser, 8mm mauser, and of course .270 and .243 and never had one buck the way that one did. Finally when he calmed down, he told me to clear my spent cartridge. I did so, and that was when I truly noticed the red mark. He then told me what happened and why. Basically he had allowed me to get lazy with all of my range time so he decided to just fix it in one nasty shot. Guess what, lesson learned. I hunted iron sights for 2 years before I put a scope on another rifle. 
---
That was my first camp. An adhesive farm..after a few quests I realized that wasn't cutting it ..now I have a purified farm. Keeps me healthy and stocked with hp. Works out pretty well
---
Can you clarify that the speed of crafting multiple items has anything to do with banning? Most people claiming this are saying that is what is causing it. If you confirm it has nothing to do with it, it shouldn’t give away too much info, and we can be sure these people are liars.
---
Thanks!
---
Did the same and I must admit; killing NPCs felt good. But knowing the game will eventually start having it's focus on content and less on trying to keep it working excites me. Plus private and modded servers give me hope.
---
Yes, let's nerf their flying too so the entire game can be a Melee Player's dream. FFS.
---
I’ll give him the whole T51-B set for some calibrated shocks
---
I get the super sledge and other "modernized" melee weapons. Or  the "Blade of the West", a fucking sharpened car bumper from NV. I don't get how a baseball bat with barbed wire is gonna do jack shit to a guy in power armor. Power Armor is literally "What if we put tank on man?" The armor is INCHES thick, and is MILITARY GRADE STEEL, if not depleted uranium. Show me a video where a man beats a tank to death with a bat. Even if Super Mutants are swinging it, that bat will break before you even dent the power armor.
---
Assaultron heads fall into that category too.  I had to manually do it to a few of them in my inventory.
---
The problem isn’t that they’re necessarily being fooled. The problem is that they eat up drama because they want to believe it to feed their indignant little rage boners. This sub gets fooled by bullshit again and again and again. They never learn. 
---
I don’t run a glass build just a melee build. I also nuke but not SBQ I have helped kill it once.
---
It does not. It's also missing the Bright Headlamp for some reason.
---
So use those 2 and then pick one more of your choice and you have 3? Correct?
---
They need something more than a timer for a lot of events, but they definitely need a timer, and adding one would be a benefit in nearly all cases.
---
For your example, knowing there is only 30 seconds left I can at least assume I'm not going to kill 5 creatures in that time, so that's some benefit. Worst case is what, you fast travel and hop in, and someone completes the event right after and you don't get anything. I'm pretty sure that's exactly what happens right now with some of the horde events, so it's not any worse than it already is for those cases.
---
Yep I wanted to make a drug or booze making base but neither one of them are something you can simply farm. Still need outside "stuff"
---
People that are selling high end gear generally don't want to push lower tier items. I'm to the point in the game I walk by 2 shot weapons. If something unique that strikes me as interesting, like quad or something I may pick it up. My point I guess, don't waste your time trying to sell to someone that has god roll items, he already did he's time on the lower end items, or is just duping scum. 
---
Dude give it up. You were fed bullshit and you gobbled it up. 
---
Only part they could poke holes in lol
---
Proof. 
---
Your computer is consciously closing Fallout 76 because it doesn't want to crash 
---
I miss mine
---
What platform are you
---
I don't feel there is a lot of difference in the carrying weight.
---
In 76 I usually have 3 to 4 weapons in my inventory. 
---
1. melee
---
2. handgun
---
3. rifle/shotgun/machinegun
---
4. whatever I feel taking with me)
---
I have one set of armor. Why do I need more than one set?? And as I said before: upgrade them with pockets or even deep pockets so you can get at least an extra 35 carry weight if you upgrade all parts.
---
If I am overencumbered I just go to a workbench and scrap all the duplicated weapons that I have picked up for blueprints. I sell all the shitload of meds. I usually don't really need more than 2 radaways for example. A few stimpacks is also enough. So I all sell that to the vendor robots. Or I just store them in the stashbox. Junk I scrap and also store. And that usually leaves me left with more than enough space to go out and explore again. It is really not that hard to maintain the inventory, and this is how I have always done it in Fallout 3, New Vegas &amp; 4. 76 has let you carry a bit more junk since crafting and building plays a bigger part in this game. But it is really no big deal to just empty your inventory every now and then into the plenty of stash boxes laying around.
---
I also "wasted" perks to get a stronger back in the previous Fallouts. So I don't understand why it is a problem here (especially since you can also remove and exchange them whenever you want.)
---
So yeah... I just don't understand the problems people have with the weight limit. For me it is just like how it has always been.
---
They’ve admitted mistakes before. Why would they ban legit players? Just apply a little common sense and you’ll have your answer. 
---
Sorry, but this answer is not satisfactory.
---
It's almost as if implying that the previous system (before Jan 29th Patch 5) was a complete fluke. The system before was where 'Scrap All' applied to all junk **but ignored** bulked resources and certain items (baseballs and beer bottles being notorious). At the same time, the crafting system used to automatically break down bulked items, one-by-one, only on an as-needed-basis depending on how many materials the crafting system needed for the crafted item. 
---
For example: you had 10 bulk steel (300 steel) and no loose steel scraps or steel-based junk, but wanted to craft an item that required 2 steel. Crafting bench would list that you had 300 steel available and crafting the item would break down one bulk steel and you would have 9 bulk steel and 28 steel scraps remaining (298 steel available). It's not new functionality--it was already working pre-Patch 5.
---
However, Patch 5 made it so bulked items were no longer available for crafting, so it would show as 0 steel available even if you had bulk steel in stock. We assumed this was due to two different issues that BGS was tried to fix on two different occasions: 
---
(1) mods/attachments were included in the count of the 'available resources' for crafting/repair and thus get used accidentally before bulk resources/loose junk, and 
---
(2) some items required in crafting were auto-scrapped as part of the 'Scrap All' system, like hardened mass got scrapped, while baseballs and beer bottles didn't (addressed in Patch 4). 
---
However, the Jan 31st hotfix went overboard and made it so 'Scrap All' somehow now applies to bulked resources, yet it can still ignore beer bottles and (probably?) hardened mass (unless that was somehow reverted due to the merging of the wrong game versions). That doesn't sound like 'new functionality needs to be implemented'. That sounds like a simple oversight/mistake.
---
People (post-Patch 5) were complaining about the inconvenience of scrapping bulk items manually because they wanted it the previous system (pre-Patch 5): where the crafting bench showed bulk items as part of the 'available resource' pool and only broke down bulk items as needed in craft/repair. The only fix needed to that system: prevent the crafting system from using mods/attachments as an available resource. How did we go from that to "bulk items that are scrapped in the character’s inventory after using the “Scrap All” option is currently working correctly" as if it was intended? The new issue was 'bulk doesn't show up as available resource after Patch 5' which was fairly inconvenient. This post-hotfix issue where all bulked resources in inventory is vulnerable to a 'Scrap All' is also just an inconvenience (doesn't truly break the game). However, trying to pass this off as "as intended" fix is really strange and hard to support. If the issue was properly addressed, bulked items shouldn't have been affected at all.
---
People wanted it so that mods/attachments weren't listed as part of the 'available resources' when you crafted/repaired something. They also wanted specific items to not be auto-scrapped, such as hardened mass (which was fixed in Patch 4). That's it. To say that skipping/ignoring bulked resources in the 'Scrap All' system is 'new functionality' that wasn't in the game before... that's extremely hard to swallow.
---
Looking myself - no luck yet. They say Grafton but I dunno. Spent hrs hopping, and no luck. 
---
That requires Bethesda to use something called logic, which ever development decision since the moment development began has clearly shown, they dont know what that is
---
Bethesda has openly requested reports about players engaging in the use of exploits.
---
I am suffering similar effects in my stealth build since the last patch.
---
I’m sorry to hear your getting negative comments on your sale. Pretty sure that’s against code of conduct on the market. I’d report him and or tell that guy to keep his mouth shut. You should be able to post and sell whatever you want without negative comments.

It’s juggling all three while not knowing how to juggle.

There are npcs just not human ones

It’s not really your place to put value on other people’s experiences.

I put 613 hours into it and feel I got my money’s worth (for the most part) but that doesn’t mean everyone is required to feel the same.

I was an admin on an arma server for a while, every single person who got banned was "unfairly banned"

yes, we all realize that.

Keyboard and mouse support for Xbox was added late last year. It seems however they may keep the peripheral proprietary. I think the first planned peripheral is going to be a bit pricey though.
---
You're so far up your own ass your eyes are brown. 
---
xbox one.
---
Have they thought of actually separating the explosive damage between launchers and rifles/pistols? That way, you can up the damage perk for missiles and nukes without touching the rifles/pistols
---
You seem to have misplaced reality and reading comprehension. 
---
i regularly craft shit loads of civil war suits to sell
---
Yes I mean more specifically the human kinds. I should have been clearer.
---
Not to sound discouraging but the 50 cal is in a really bad state for ammo to damage. Maybe find yourself a Gatling to help conserve. 
---
Just in random suit cases and stuff like that.  
---
Joke or real info?
---
I gotchu when I'm home if you need it
---
Is this your first online game? 
---
Whoops whoops whoops. It is a 2-star (90% weight, 40% swing speed). Had my 3-star deathclaw gauntlet on my mind.
---
::sigh:: I'm gonna drop my 1* AA Gauss rifle in the bushes tonight. She got me through a lot, sniped the face off a lot of TSE wielders. No way she's going to end up in a vendor bot's inventory. But as you described, it's time for me to move on.
---
&gt;over 500,000 (in some cases, tens of millions)
---
This never should have been possible, but damn. The CTDs and SNRs kinda make sense now.
---
Ahh, no, I see what you're saying now. I agree!
---
I might not last that long it has me constantly overweight and I am starting to starve and dehydrate because of it
---
That’s actually a really good idea. I’ll probably do something similar then. At one point I had put the gate backwards against the fence so it looked like it was connected, but it was still pretty janky. 
---
Really, i've been doing 6 a day
---
What does that have to do with anything? Did you read their post? Lol. 
---
Shit.. I'll still message you when I'm home and see if you still want one. Sorry bud :/
---
As long as it’s nothing particularly rare or in staggeringly large quantities, it’s likely just higher level guys trying to shed weight by dropping stuff they don’t use.  Plans are 1/4lb each. A bunch of useless, unsellable plans take up space so we drop them.  Some are nice enough to drop them where others can pick them up and read them if they haven’t found them yet. 
---
Same for ammo. After like level 30 I had no use for 38 ammo. It built up quickly though from all the drops so I dropped it off in overseers caches to provide it for others who may need it. Same goes for fusion cells and other ammo I don’t use. 
---
Mad
---
When you have hundreds of components all intercommunicating, just saying the majority can be prevented through "diligent testing and double checking your work" is just inane. You simply can't test for every scenario that may cause a bug to occur. Has nothing to do with "taking this personally". Only problem is you making statements which are not valid. 
---
Yeah, even in high school, I had a hard time getting my projects started due to having to draw everything out. My instructor wouldn't let me slide with writing out my cuts and guestimating how many board feet of wood I would have to purchase. He wanted down to the 1/16th of an inch and only to allow no more than 10% for cuts and whatnot. I would have a friend draw me something close to what I wanted, get me the amount of wood I needed, then I would just build it by what I was seeing in my scatterbrain. I did the same thing in metal shop. He really hated it when my smoker project worked better than all but a couple people that had been welding since they were kids because their dads were pipe fitters, and they did projects on the side. I did a side box after drawing up a box under the barrel, which really sucks for smoking since the heat is under the barrell so it is hard to control the heat and smoke. By going with the side box, I was able to control my temp and smoke levels. I ended up selling my first smoker for $300 and it only cost me $65 in materials. Too bad I couldn't get the stuff that cheap anymore. I would gladly build Texas smokers to the people here in Illinois. 
---
damn, just missed you guys!
---
Big difference between people personally banning accounts and robots banning accounts. False VAC bans do happen.
---
It’s ok
---
Neither was ESO. Most of the current playerbase of that game isn't anything like the playerbase at the start. The people who originally bought it were pretty disappointed it wasn't like Skyrim/Oblivion
---
yeah my evening was off to a great start should never have logged on first half hour I got mauled by a level 32 Wendigo :(
---
So you basically just want to be able to fast travel for free then? Because You can already join events for free if your close enough. I do it to ensure I get credit all the time. 
---
Made me laugh!
---
 "perk card packs are useless to me" I don't know what there algorithm is for perk packs. I have a level 250 and a level 90, never have I gotten a perk pack worth while, it's always pick lock or some other garbage.
---
I am not the one complaining about a video game on a subreddit for that game. A game that he obviously plays a lot if he posts on a market sub constantly.
---
I mean if that comment offended you, you might need more than calibrated shocks to get you through life. 
---
Damn.. yeah sounds rough :l 
---
I had the same shit happened to me I have never knowingly used any exploits and am currently in a 2 going on 3 weeks to get my final response email regarding it. 
---
You should be aware that it’s an entire account ban, meaning you no longer have access to mods (on console) for FO4 or Skyrim SE or access to creations you may have purchased. They swung that ban hammer hard and without any discretion. But hey they have an iron TOS agreement written by a team of lawyers to ensure they can do this kind of shit at their leisure 
---
I mean, shields wouldn't do much against any kind of firepower. Shields are better for like...zombies. Walking dead style zombies.
---
Consider this post a beta run of the AMA. Based on results, they're going to squash the notion entirely.
---
I can imagine it in the board meeting. "Hey, who wants to volunteer to get butt-raped by the internet for a day while getting paid the same?"
---
Aww, I wish It was possible, I just have 90% weight and +10% health on mine
---
I really wonder how everyone is playing... I don’t think I’ve ever grinded anything so far. I’ve done a single lucky hole mine run, just to check it out... pretty productive, and I didn’t even find the hidden room(s?). I just loot as normal... and play... efficiently? IDK. Might be because my main is a fully perked HW with an Instigating and an AA Gatling gun, so I don’t use much ammo and I don’t get hit much, and in PA I don’t need to repair armor often... and my alt is a stealth sniper so same results for different reasons
---
It's funny that the molotovs even look like the vodka bottles 
---
This is a bit old, but Same, i saw it was empty thought nothing of it and left it in the hall. I wasn't aware it was supposed to have armor on it till just now.
---
Speak for yourself. Vendor limits mean you can farm 1400 caps/day max, but figure you still have some fast travel overhead to get to all the vendors (or hours to walk it all). Even if you only spend 100 caps to get to all vendors, you're still losing 8% of your potential every day. 
---
And that is a \*really\* optimistic estimate. More than likely that percentage will be much higher if you don't have an optimized CAMP placement. 
---
Yeah don't let someone who might get as much use out of it as you find it on some vendor. That would be way too considerate. And nobody wants 1\* items generally because they are everywhere. People have to throw them away because of the low carry and stash limits. Thus they are seen as trash. I still keep some AA items, and lost a bunch trying to put them on another character, as I guess I used the wrong kind of container or something.
---
Yah same. I never bought into the totally and completely innocent crafting and trading excuses. Also some ppl just want to throw molotovs into the mix to watch things burn or to try getting ppl to rally around the company as completely evil and unsalvagable villains now. 
---
Gl
---
All I meant was if they were actually banning people for that, I'd have been banned weeks ago.
---
I agree &amp; I’m sorry that happened.         
---
Any real merchant is able to sell, trade &amp; roleplay as they want. There’s no “merchant rules”. 
---
Hey man do what ever, there still is a market for low end items. It's just when you have a game with a fixed market with no ladder system, things get stale.
---
Or we are having them, and we are just able to cope with them A LOT better.  I don't think people understand what "unplayable" means.  I didn't expect a game designed to be played for years and evolve with the community to be perfect in the first couple months.  Obviously many did and there concerns make putting new content on the back burner the safe thing to do.  
---
could a US government drop contain a addictol?
---
Mine was an empty frame so I left it discarded v.v
---
Platform?
---
I don't mind them and it's nice to pop in to farm stims or something, but I think they should disable PvP at least for the duration of the event. Just doesn't make sense unless the point is for other players to try and attack the workshop when it's vulnerable, but they certainly don't present it that way.
---
look man, you're walmart, they're Gucci. Different tastes 
---
I've got plenty of TSE but never in the same gun.
---
Yes. I want technicolor explosions lighting up the landscape, machine guns pummeling, sniper rifles precision striking, plasma and lasers and missiles streaking toward targets being simultaneously clubbed to death. Make every weapon category viable to bring greater variety to PvE and PvP alike.
---
Making this even better would be more variety per caliber of craftable ammo—armor piercing, explosive (maybe replace the legendary effect), incendiary, subsonic (for use with suppressors in stealth situations), etc.
---
And I'd like to see the Fat Man be absolutely devastating, but only on the rarest of occasions. Mini Nukes should be scarce and probably not craftable.
---
That said, enemies are too spongy.
---
Fast travel to events for free.   Thought that was clear?
---
1. events are poorly attended
---
2. there is no way to know how much time is left in an event
---
3. people dont like wasting caps to go to an event that is done/bugged
---
4. its too small an amount to be a real cap sink, especially in light of the new plan/recipe prices since last patch
---
I don't know about anyone else but, I'm pretty hard right now.
---
Umm not 100% sure but I think it's a possible drop yes.
---
I have one but it's lvl45 I think..the 50 Cal is the best gun I can use right now at lvl39. I'm going in a shit cycle of catching a level or two at white springs and then running out of ammo lol
---
Yeah the horror stories about innocent people getting banned didn't start until  Bethesda cracked down on duping.  It's hard not to at least suspect a connection.
---
Glad you are taking it seriously, but tbh legendaries should never have been trade-able if you're not going to test the game for  duping exploits before launch or during beta.
---
Ah. Damn. Was gonna see if u wanted to start a new char. With a few others. Im on xbox tho. 
---
I think that there are still some RNG slots for each vendor, and that these slots will be populated by plans and mods that will be player specific and refresh when server hopping like before the patch.
---
This is gold.            
---
“What’s that fallout 76 game like?”             
---
-shows then this video. 
---
I've already said it, but a timer would still be a partial improvement for almost any event.
---
yep, that happened to me at +100 level. 
---
I guesss the previous Whitespring visitor was a solitary low level player (rare) and he caused some of those level 9 to spam... the I arrived and started the spawn the level 62 ghouls.
---
Because apparently the survivors aren’t smart enough to stuff enough cloth in the bottle to keep it from coming out, so they need glue.
---
Not helpful or accurate, Walmart is doing just fine, and it's not simply a matter of taste.
---
The big difference is exactly right. I was banned from DAOC, as were many others. Company said 'we' were executing a specific order of keyboard commands to cheat (long time ago, no idea what the cheat was). Problem is those key sequences closely resembled legitimate commands. Humans being what they are, I and many others fat fingered the legitimate sequences, never executed a cheat, but were still caught up in the ban wave. All of us protested, all of us were mocked. And a month later, we got untanned - at least those of us who fat fingered, and never actually cheated. Different time, different company, but it takes humans eyeballing the details as it appears BSG is doing here.
---
1. If last fast travel was to an event, and that event is then completed and you get credit for it, refund the caps on event completion.
---
2. Show remaining time on the map info when viewing an event. 
---
When Bethesda said every human in the game would be a real person, this is the kind of memories and stories I think they hoped we would make together. Awesome.
---
You guys are stupid. It’s not the gun. It’s Bethesda. It’s also not the PS4. I own one, and I have NEVER had this problem  
---
I used to play the Bethesda games on console but then I got a PC a year ago and haven't really considered buying new games for them, exception being the Switch. I mostly buy old games I sold a while back to play on them, or I just buy them when they on sale on Steam.
---
It's almost like people stopped playing the game. Nukes are also pointless now.
---
I completed this at level 140-something, and got a level 1 leather leg. *shrug*
---
Or why not both?
---
How do you know they banned you for crafting costumes?
---
Check your local Costco, it's about $15 USD
---
No, he's referring to another reply he made linking the recent Bethesda post.
---
Someone wants elder scrolls in their fallout
---
What level are you? I have spare military fatigues and a spare combat helmet. I can also craft light combat armor arms, but nothing else that I know of. I’m willing to trade to you for free if you’d like. 
---
I've got about 200 plans. I'm up for a plan exchange. Just say when and post your IGN. Mine is jchamlin
---
Cult of the Mothman is the only cult that matters
---
I was not under the impression that equipment sold to a vendor bot would be available to a subsequent player at that bot. Is that the case?
---
If you have str build it’s not a problem either way it’s just that egg is regarded is without benefit. It’s not painful like empath but you lose carry weight.
---
Carrying rad x to get full strength back is a decent tool, I regard it like swapping my pack rat to finish looting and fast travel to camp or station.
---
i feel like i have all the power connectors but i don't see any wall passthrough... am i doing it wrong?
---
I'm actually the opposite. All the chances are just about done. I would put part of the blame on the shilling they do on this subreddit attempting to manipulate the votes and stuff. That is shady as fuck. And if they are so against "cheating", why are they themselves cheating on reddit? You have to almost lie to yourself to overlook all of the issues this game has. I'm actually done helping in any way with this game. I've given many hours of my time trying to be positive and helpful about this game. Now my patience is gone. If I continue to play I just want to burn it all down. CAMP at Whitespring. Take every owned Workshop. Attack everyone I see. Because F this game. That's why.
---
Completely understood and agreed. In fact, I want nothing more than for the game to fix it's issues and become much better. 
---
That’s the only effect I have found in 4 weapons from my 100+ h of farm... please buff it up again! If u don’t like the E then just remove it from the game I don’t care I just want to be able to do dmg again with all my weapons. 
---
It’s called Power Armor in the Fallout Universe.
---
Thanks for your help!
---
This is as I feared. This is somewhat problematic given that Bethesda said they both made all the plans the vendors sold available AND they justified the price increase of these plans due to the plan's availability.
---
If there are some plans that still require RNG to obtain, we're not THAT much better off than we were before.

Todd Howard here, we suggest purchasing cosmetic from the atomic shop to enrich your gameplay experience. 
---
We recommend at least 5000 atom to enjoy everything the store has to offer.
---
because the simpler the solution, the greater the chance that bethesda can actually implement it.
---
i want a dope related item.
---
Walking is always going to be even more fruitless because you are guaranteed to waste more event time, or even that it will end before you get there.
---
I haven't seen them post patch either. But I do occasionally find a plan that I don't know. Last night I found heavy combat armor chest at Harper's Ferry. So, it appears a few plans still show up at random and aren't guaranteed to be at vendors each visit.
---
I'm not calling for merchant rules. I'm saying if you only sell God rolls you're not a merchant, you're a dealer, going with t Ferrari example above.
---
All good, All Rise is my go-to Melee weapon. God Save the Watoga Quest Chain that delivered it into our grubby  little hands :D
---
Bullshit. Screenshot. 
---
This is actually a pretty reasonable compromise
---
I hope you realize that the FO4 recipe for Molotovs used Glass, the material. Adhesive (2), Cloth (1), Glass (2), Oil (4)
---
Yes, sorry for my attitude. Maybe nobody will see it. But I found alot of good items at certain vendor bots sold by other players. Like Whitespring Artisans Corner, Watoga Phoenix, and Watoga Station, etc.
---
Can confirm this one. In the room marked Laundry on the long table between some stacks of linens.
---
I dont support or condone dupping, but why in the hell would WE help Bethesda fix the game they fucked up from day one? It's out of the goodness of our hearts the game even has a playerbase still.
---
To be fair... Shooters are way better on pc compaired to console. I prefer a controller but you can literally use a xbox controller on pc now so really its just about what you got/can afford. I like my Xbox but i dont own a pc anymore. I wouldnt mind gaming on pc if i could get a good gaming spec pc and not have to upgrade every couple years to keep up haha. Xbox is convienient for me because hardwares locked in and i only need to update the console and not the hardware. 
---
FO76 is the messy abortion nobody wanted. 
---
Yea, I sent a feedback ticket. Mine doesn't do it anymore since the last patch. Not sure if it was the patch that fixed it or something else but it doesn't make that noise on any weapon anymore. Weird.
---
What are the types of Armor? I use full tier Ironclad, Barb and always keep my armor fully over repaired as soon as it gets low enough to repair. Heavy Combat Chest with all Heavy Leather Limbs. 
---
no meme content as posts
---
U give Bethesda WAY too much credit at this point lol.
---
I dont play the "who's better" bs. Pc, ps4 and xbox all have pros n cons haha
---
Have you considered new mechanisms that address the fundamental reason people need to craft a ton of items in the first place?  
---
As an example, you cannot reliably unlock armor mods.  There is no guaranteed path to get any specific mod, and they don't reliably drop from any specific enemies.  
---
So if my goal is to say, unlock "deep pocket mod" for combat armor my best bet is crafting a giant number of combat armor pieces and scrapping them.  The rarity of some armor mods as the learn chance is extremely low in the first place and you learn fewer and fewer mods per item scrapped as you go.  
---
Another example is rare guns like lever action rifle, radium rifle, handmade, gauss.  All guns of lower rarity have enemies that reliably drop these so you can "farm" to learn the mods you want.  But those rare guns have no enemies that reliably use them so the only path is to craft a ton of these.  At least the rate at which you learn the mods from guns is sort of reasonable, it must be at least 20 or 30x higher odds.  
---
Providing enemies that drop the items players need to unlock mods would help address the root issue here as would increasing the rate at which armor mods are learned.  Lastly if there was some repeatable daily event or similar that guaranteed "unknown" weapon/armor mods as a reward players could engage in a potentially better/more fun gameplay loop to acquire the mods they want.

Power Armor's inability to completely negate damage from the lowly .38 pipe gun leads me to believe we are making some grossly inaccurate assumptions with regards to its efficacy. The joints and moving parts of the armor are unlikely to stop a well directed knife thrust as well as the chest plate might. And as for your bludgeoning implements, there will still be a significant transfer of kinetic energy which could lead to a harmful concussive style injury. I have not tested this, but I suspect the sequence of events in your baseball bat scenario will go as follows: a number of swings, death of occupant, a much larger number of swings, bat or armor breaks. And by armor breaks, I am not suggesting a steel plate shattering. We have evidence power armor relies upon circuitry, mechanical linkages, electric motors and some manner of fusion core/fission battery. Without stimpaks, the occupant is dead before the armor ever breaks; in game or in a hypothetical realistic scenario. The armor breaks later, but the 'most reasonable' failure component will be one of the numerous sensors, regulators or motive devices integral to the armor's fantastical/fictitious performance. I am not aware of your familiarity with industrial equipment. It must be stated that even small bearing misalignments or deviations in clearance tolerances can lead to immediate catastrophic failure. I generally have more fun when I let a video game be a video game. And while not necessarily the point of all this, I will concede the game could use additional balance patches.
---
You can do events for caps as well
---
This guy is beyond obviously full of shit. I'm glad there are people like us that see through his bullshit.

Look over on the right side of the page.  There is a small box and next to it says "SHOW MY FLAIR ON THIS SUBREDDIT."  Check the box and under that you can edit what the flair says.

I haven't seen them lately. I have learnt them and can craft them for you for materials. Ive also unlocked I think all mods for combat as well. Gt vespaboy1975 I think I have chest and arm or chest and legs for sale
---
Just Barbarian, Ironclad with Fix it good is a must when your armor gets either bit damaged.
---
But then I took an arrow to the knee.
---
If true, BGS please run a sting and bust 'em!
---
Kind of astounded by the number of people wholly believing Bethesda's word at face value.
---
Very true, very true indeed. We all have opinions and people should respect each others opinion.
---
Can confirm. Same porch you get the Survivor Story: Miguel Cldera from a footlocker.

You can as easily ask how you're carrying it at all considering it's bigger than you.

Tyvm!

i could help you out, what’s your gt i’ll invite you 
---
In Soviet Russia, emails dupe you!
---
I have to say, I criticize Bethesda a lot. Like, a lot, and very harshly. But this is the kind of communication I want to see and I want to give you some positive feedback. Kudos on this, but keep in mind that you must keep it up on a regular basis, and keep looking for more ways to keep players in the loop. It's essential to regaining goodwill from your playerbase after months of poor, one-way "black hole" communication. This is a step on the path to doing that, but you've a distance to travel yet.
---
Aww man I wish 
---
Xbox 1
---
I have lost several abilities to craft items that I HAVE crafted before,. The most frustrating loss is my speed demon,   
---
Of which, you are the only one complaining.
---
Just move on man, your life will be less toxic.
---
Todd Howard here, we understand your frustration and will be rolling back to the previous version of the future hotfix to the past stable build of the last open beta. This will allow us to revert any fixes that may have unintentionally been implemented.
---
I doubt it was on purpose but they are definitely tracking and banning them now.
---
&gt;2 months ago
---
Already sold it my man. Sorry. 
---
They did it with treasure maps and plans too.  Those cause more problems than Nuka Cola etc.
---
The horde events are a mess and I've also seen them require you hop again to areas even farther from the event than where you started from.  
---
Walking is only viable if the event is close enough that fast travel cost doesn't matter much anyway. Otherwise you just run more chances that it's going to not have enough time to complete or already be over.  
---
The cynic in me wonders if they aren't doing this on purpose, so people will "gamble" caps on the chance of event rewards, but there's significant RNG that they might get nothing.
---
same as my name here
---
Hmmm...
---
I’m not buying this, just like Bethesda’s next game. 
---
They’ve failed at basic programming since launch, I highly doubt they have the tools or ability to gauge crafting versus duping. 
---
Can someone who still has this game installed make 300 of any weapon and record it?  
---
Yup, each weapon mod has a chance you will learn it when you scrap the weapon.
---

I have two of the three Gunslinger perks IIRC, I think my other AGI perks are Sneak and Escape Artist (I'd have to get back to you on that one, it's been a while). The 10mm pistol is *nasty* with sneak damage, with the right attachments you can kill even stuff like Scorchbeasts very quickly with 10mm sneak damage. 
---
Really, so what you are saying is nobody can have a opinion different than you and not play the game.  I have played the fallout series since the beginning.  I love the games.  But that does not mean I am a blind follower of what ever they tell me. I have, and just like you, am allowed to have opinions about things.  But unlike you.  I dont sit here and say that you are not allowed to speak you opinion unless it is the same as mine.  So as you said earlier,   go home kid.
---
It is a fixed list but there is no reset. What ever item they had before the patch they have now. All the items before the patch. No timer or anything.
---
It flags your account, warping out won’t undo it.

It’s bullshit. Banned.

Do you know how much they cost

The term "naval rifles" is used interchangeably with "naval artillery" and has been since the late 19th century. And I was really trying to be humorous rather than semantic, Mr Serious Internet Businessman.

Mermaid man... I mean Manta man Is awesome, I think I'm going to get the silver shroud as well. I've been debating on the tuxedo set also.

If you're on PC I'd happily trade you a few. But yeah, radscorpions are tough to find, and rarely drop eggs anyway. I think I found more radscorpion eggs in lunchboxes.
---
There is an addictol that spawns in the medical or science wing of the whitesprings bunker isnt there? I  see them there all the time.
---
at white springs, i’ll invite you to my team 
---
I completely understand that and respect that, It costed me over $1,300 to buy my pc and a new PS4/Xbox One costs about $300, give or take. To some it just ain't worth the cost when the same game can be bought on cheaper hardware. To each their own I say.
---
If you search the sub for "[g2a](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=g2a&amp;restrict_sr=on)" you'll find a bunch of posts about people getting the game, then having it disappear from their account later, held hostage until they repurchase.
---
The EU protects the resale of software licenses (hence there's a massive market for used EU keys) but I don't think they have to honor them anywhere else. Then FO76 is not just software but also a service. And you never really know what you're getting from g2a. Some of it's stolen, or returned, or keys intended for reviewers, or bought with stolen money.
---
Doesn’t the fountain in Whitesprings cure addictions?
---
Is it written in the terms of service somewhere you are not allowed 150,000 of any object? Is anyone able to know ahead of time this would lead to revoking other single player games on the account?
---
T'is a sad day.
---
I understand all too well. I’m a father. 
---
Pretty sure certain legendary effects make a different too. Seems like explosive rounds take more per shot. Also the black powder rifles as a whole deteriorate faster than other rifles. 
---
Jet pack  is like 7k same as calibrated shocks
---
If course the reward isn't there and it's bugged. Fits the rest of the game.
---
don't have that unlocked and even if I did I am constantly overweight and can't fast travel.
---
Man this sounds just like what I'm saying XD. I get what you mean, but your idea is "someone wants something, they order I do that order" and my idea is "I'm selling something people may want, if they do its here" either way we are both providing the given item to a customer. But as a seller I'd rather have my stuff out for everyone to see rather then me having to look for a buyer, as you would have to filter through to find someone with a "request form" for your item your selling. 
---
Bethesda stated that the bans were for a majority of people with 500,000+ quantity of rare items. A minority were those with \~150,000 quantity rare items who were reported due to trades.
---
I can't fast travel tho I am constantly overweight 
---
Gary? 
---
Not sure about the approach but as of late I spend a ridiculous amount of time and springs repairing my 2 shot lever action rifle. 
---
There are almost no armor mod plans anywhere since the known plans patch. I saw an ultra-light marine plan in Watoga but that's about it.
---
I suspect this is unintentional, but if you don't want to wait then you'll probably have to find someone to mod them for you.
---
i’ll fast travel to you don’t worry 
---
Frank Horrigan is a Super Mutant who has cutom made power armor grafted to him and ripped a Deathclaw in half. I'm pretty sure if he is hunting you down, you're gonna be in for a bad time.
---
I want this very much, It would be a good way to introduce craftable mounted head trophies to fo76. 
---
Frank Horrigan might be a special case, the exception to the rule if you will. Frank Horrigan might be a man surrounded by children. Frank Horrigan might have bear hands. Power Armor might be designed to handle compressive stresses, with no regard given to tensile stresses. Fallout 2 might be a turn based isometric view game. The world is full of possibilities.
---
I think the one near the the start with the Mr. Farmhands causes them to stop attacking all players. But being limited to the area and only the already laughably easy farmhands really only helps the odd fresh Vault newbie at best.
---
You guys have zero credibility anymore. I'd believe a random player before I'd believe anything coming out of that studio.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/?utm_source=reddit-android they actually have a way of tracking it now they even said it in their response 
---
I have chest and legs for sale gt vespaboy1975
---
Yeah that’s the thing - due to their low VATS cost, pistol builds are kind of designed to be tied with Luck crit builds. But I guess it shouldn’t be required to be viable.
---
Just hang out with some Liberators, you'll learn Chinese in no time
---
Doesn't matter.  The kid duped and got shit on by the devs.  He got what he should have.
---
I was in stealth when Rad Worms disease timer ran out, and I just so happened to fast travel before I unstealthed, and when I reappeared I was permanently stealthed. Enemies could still see me, even re-stealthed, and I'm not sure if players could or not. I haven't been able to reproduce it, and I don't know if it is related to the other problem at all, but just thought I would mention it.
---
Oh wow that might actually get me interested enough to hop on for a day lol hopefully my house I worked so hard on building hasn’t been packed away again can’t stand losing all that work again lol
---
Are you guys based off the enclave that want the old rule still?
---
I can't buy or sell anything. It says I am overweight but I am not. Not being able to sell is really screwing me badly. I even dumped a bunch of stuff trying to get it working. Lost all of it when server disconnected. And support's suggested fixes have not worked. Didn't start till I got Excavator Armor.
---
I think the enclave med spawns are all random, although I do see addictol there fairly often.
---
Oh ok thanks 
---
Mutants man, fucking mutants
---
It runs away when you run out of time on the event, I guess signifying that you just allowed all of America to he screeched at by a bat
---
Haha I know what you mean! I meant playable if barely at times
---
&gt; exploiters are making servers unstable 
---
Not just exploiters, everyone crafting more than one item per second.
---
I could take your whole cult out witha lamp and a flamethrower 
---
I must have felt optimistic when I wrote it. I've had no server crashes today call me lucky! But yes at times they are just barely playable. 
---
So not west-tek but nach Westen-tek
---
is that all you needed ? is so take care man 
---
right In salty....you are litreraly crying over a child's game. but I'm salty.  bye 
---
Lev 171 here. I’ve barely played in last two weeks. I have gear and weapons, yes even post nerf, I’m not thrilled about but they still get the job done aptly.  Ammo and mats to make more or repair whatever I need many times over. I’ve built a camp that suits me. I’ve whittled down all excesses in my inventory by selling to vendors so I have a small amount of room in my stash. A very modest amount of caps but I am really not the guy that must have every plans or item in game.  All aid items to par levels. No interest in  changing my build. There are others I like but I’m not going through all that as I’m happy with my current build so naturally I have zero interest in grinding out another character. As far as I’m concerned there is no reason for me to log on until new content is out or to simply check the new patches/bugs out briefly. I imagine there are many hardcore or even more hardcore players like me that feel the same.  
---
/shrug 
---
nothing to do, no end game content, no log in. 
---
I don't think that's correct. I remember back when I used shotguns, they broke a lot faster per shot than the rifles, and the Dragon certainly does. It's just not well balanced for some weapons.
---
Not quite. Two separate parts. One for unique items like weapons/armor and a commodity market for aid/junk. The former would be auction style. No WTB postings. The latter would be like a stock market where buy and sell orders are automatically paired by the system, like the real stock market. If I post a Buy order for say 10 bulk steel at 10 caps a piece and someone already has some for sell order for that price or lower, the trade is completed by the system for the seller’s price. I never see the buy or sell postings, only make my order and whenever a compatible order comes along, the trade is completed automatically. This is how the real stock market works, but on a significantly larger scale. 
---
Remember, run around kill everything on ground and have open area around. They land quicker 
---
All X01 mods are only available in the Enclave armory. RNG availability. Middle terminal is the only one working at the moment. 
---
Todd Howard here, along with the hot fix came a loot balancing patch to make sure no player was progressing too quickly, your game crashing is just a symptom of it working. Due to duping exploiter we had to ensure that cheaters did not crash the games economy, we hope you understand that enjoyment of the game has to come secondary to our in game market.
---
Seen this other online games as well. People will sell online currency, sell in game in game items for cash, use exploits to crash a ranked game and on it goes.
---
They get caught and come to forums to say how they never did anything and it's unfair blah blah.  It gets people coming to their support and makes them feel better about being shitty. 
---
Eventually the truth all comes out and you never hear from these people again.
---
Honestly at this point the reason you have accounts still turned off is because of your very questionable 4-day ticket rule. How can you say reports of unfair bans are false when you still haven't answered many of your own tickets of people trying to appeal that they were wrongly banned. The fact that you have a 4-day ticket system coupled with the fact that users can't tell if you have even seen there ticket unless you respond to them directly does not incite me to believe this post at all. Fix your appeal system and don't forget us power armor editions are still waiting for our canvas bags. You have a tall mountain to climb before we can believe you calling other reports "unequivocally false".
---
Blueprints used to save entire structures regardless of budget but it was "fixed" because it was a "bug" and I can't harp on how stupid that is enough
---
I've wasted a few perk points on Dead Man Sprinting, and Squad Maneuvers already :'(
---
Hey man you still need my help? Just got home
---
It takes 500K dups in 30 days to be detected.  Nice to know that only the people most likely to choke to death while drinking water are the ones being caught...
---
Yeah, I think it would be really cool walking around with a safe door as a shield on my arm. 
---
yeah the only issue is currently they count as a world item and do not respawns even if you jump to a new server . in the past you could fill up on eggs via world jumping then , do a mass omelette crafting then hop to all the faction sell points while singing "I am the eggman "  . it's still somewhat lucrative just not as much as before. 
---
As a TSE user (it took me 200 levels, but I got mine legitimately), I agree with much of what you said here, although I'd actually like to see the explosive legendary effect completely nixed. The novelty of my TSE was cool at first, before the nerf, but frankly I had a lot more pure fun playing with the Two Shot Handmade I'd had before that (it disappeared). Two Shot without Explosive is a lot of fun, it's less annoying to other players, and it makes Fallout's spongy enemies … acceptable I guess.
---
I'd like to see Two Shot restored and explosive (the legendary effect) nixed completely. Okay, what I *really* want is less spongy enemies, no damage-affecting legendary effects at all, and a variety of craftable ammo for each caliber—armor piercing (to replace Anti-Armor), explosive, (to replace Explosive), incendiary, subsonic (for use with suppressors), and some kind of hot load to replace Two Shot (shouldn't *double* damage though). IIRC New Vegas did something like this. The ammo type should dictate weight, crafting resources needed, and weapon condition reduction per shot (there needs to be a cost associated with packing this kind of heat).
---
This will probably never happen now that players have tasted these legendary effects, but with Two Shot and Explosive so neutered, wouldn't ammo variety be preferable? More balanced, more strategic planning and tactical choices to make, more variety of possible scenarios in firefights.
---
Whatever the solution, killing a horde of glowing bloated ones shouldn't take a thousand rounds just because you're a low level and don't have a legendary gun. Been there, and I like a challenge but tedium isn't fun. Just my 2¢.
---
Don’t do drugs 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Sorry I had to say it lol
---
Too bad it's nerfed, they don't respawn with a server hop anymore.
---
bye!
---
be free, have fun!
---
Yo you end up help mah dude out? Don't wanna log in if you got him :)
---
boo enclave , I'm mostly okay with the brotherhood ;p
---
i think the laser pistol breaks faster..i can kill about 6 lvl 40 mole miners then it breaks..so if you wanted to use this weapon you would need to repair it every 15 minutes..
---
Seriously, I've watched games undergo balancing for years and always need more balancing.
---
Not that where anywhere close as is, but a meta will always emerge.
---
Word? I had a TSE 10mm but it kills me when things get too close. I haven’t tried sneaking with it, I only use it as a last resort. 
---
I’ll have to fill out those gunslinger perk cards and see what damage I can do with them. 
---
Depends on what you are looking to buy. Generally speaking we are talking thousands of caps. You are better off trading for the t51 or piecing together your own suit. Lots of folks on the reddit trade pages are building sets for a modest fee and selling them. You might want to search a bit.
---
Oh kinda like javelins in Diablo 2! Yes!
---
"I didn't know that I couldn't do that" is an acceptable plea from players who took advantage of a few FO76 glitch/feature. All is forgiven, brothers and sisters. Let's continue to play FO76 now.
---
They happen, but at a rate of maybe a couple per month. Not hundreds a day
---
They are part of the rewards for turning in technical documents. 
---
Stop trying to ruin the game by lying, just let Bethesda do it on their own...
---
Thank you! I feel like a chump backing out like this, I just hope maybe this post somehow adds to the pile and FO76 becomes better because of said pile.
---
Quality of life. Same reason you don't have to use the bathroom, scrub your CAMP's floors, clean your guns, etc.
---
Liberators just don't seem to hang around long enough around me. I don't know why...
---
What resources does a level 40 T-51B Need 
---
The trailer was good.
---
One point of Tod's presentation at E3 was hilarious, when he pretended having very low server populations was a great feature.
---
Something like "you won't play with hundreds, or thousands but DOZENS of other players" and then explains it's the apocalypse so there wouldn't be a lot of people.
---
Yet, there's a vault full of 1000 people leaving at the same time...
---
Awesome, grinding heavy robot gear to skip hazmat was the last remaining goal for me.
---
I actually don't know what this is, Ive never got to the endgame story wise.
---
All I know is, going to the whitesprings when nuked and meleeing feral ghouls constantly isn't that much fun after a while.
---
Rip lvls
---
Just take a break and see what happens in a few months. They might get their act together and get some balance going and add some kick ass content. That's what I'm hoping for. 
---
I’d love to see the handmade 
---
The sonic disruption one sounds amazing 
---
Threads less than an hour old don’t show how many upvotes or downvoted it has to prevent the reddit hive mind from destroying threads, or trolls/shills from starting a chain reaction of downvoted before a thread has a chance to be seen. 
---
The Brotherhood will support you on this one
---
We all know those "I got banned for crafting X" r salty dupers.
---
The game was loaded with em to begin with. Anytime I see a post about a player justifying about having stupid amounts of certain items/weapons/armor. I just laugh... As if duping was never a thing.
---
My friend's close call with a Ban story:
---
I remember my friend telling me that a low level is throwing crazy quantaties of items, we are talking about 5 digits all scattered into a little bag.
---
My friend asks me if i want anything and i told him leave the trash on the floor. The guy threw it for a reason and I explained to him that there was a ban going to hit. He was so tempted but he decided to listen, his buddy on the other hand, disregarded my warning and picked up all the shit on the floor.
---
The next day when all the first bans kicked in on the dupers. My friend's buddy took a ride on the ban wagon lol. As for my friend, he was so grateful that he took my advice. Otherwise they both would have got the boot.
---
Just like the skyrim simulations lol
---
I have been taking a break :/
---
I’ll give it 5 or so months before I return. Just heartbroken
---
Yeah I've been doing this one for a while, it's a pretty nice farm! Just gotta remember to turn them into omelettes quick because the eggs dont have a very long lifespan otherwise 
---
Good we need cannon fodder 
---
To clarify, I'm not saying it Shouldn't weigh 10 lbs in your inventory, I'm just saying that the armor having to carry its own weight is really dumb justification for potentially having Less carry weight in power armor than your regular armor. 
---
The past 2 days of invincible SBQs and mutations not working and my ARMOR not working at all I have reached a whole new level of frustration I had previously thought unattainable
---
They are lying. People are also using these fake threads to ruin this game's reputation on other subreddits even more. It's disgusting.
---
I still have my mule that has like 50k weight I’m curious to see if they will catch me lmao, I don’t even play anymore atm, too busy with KH3 and Spider-Man, it’s just funny to me how people get so triggered by exploiters, it’s a game there will always be cheaters, I could give a shit what other people do in a video game.
---
Ya, it's got a ton of potential for sure. Fallout with friends ftw
---
I feel you. 60 bucks is pretty big in my situation and it sucks that I spent it for this.
---
I have a two shot nonexplosive 10mm that I still carry. It got killed with the new nerd tho. When i use the old hunting rifle, I use the rifle a lot actually for CQB, a lot of running backwards and using VATS tho.
---
We had 20 minutes left but it was about 2% health so I'd guessed it hit scared and ran which is bs.
---
They're in the enemy list for the official Fallout 76 Prima guide. Has a screenshot with one and a 2 stack nuclear plant behind it. Mentions they're super rare.
---
A lot of the guide is unfinished and some of it is live/will be live.
---
Was just interesting to see the Flatwoods Monster and the Zetans definitely be separate.
---
Oh, that would make perfect sense then.  I'm fine with not being wanted for accidental damage.
---
Haha Good one
---
i have another one on my server join from my gamer tag in my post 
---
join me again i have another one on my server 
---
[ T]7
---
I met a lot of cool people on this game and the potential lost is really stinging my booty hole right now
---
That's dumb
---
I mean i enjoyed survival mode in nv. That was more realistic though,my character wasnt constantly being harrassed with diseased and didnt need to eat the equivalent of a newborn baby whale.
---
I found one on a level 9 ghoul today at WhiteSpring. All really have been random for me. 
---
We’re looking into this, thanks for your report!
---
Whoever nuked it should have angled it so you can fight the queen outside the nuke zone
---
I seem to get them from boss enemies in locations. Other than that it seems pretty random. Maybe run the horde events a bit? Those seem to have legendary enemies and boss enemies.
---
I use a Gauss as my main, and also have 10mm for indoor medium range wetwork. Up close a have a nice 3 star combat knife that has +40% speed. it is the machine gun of melee, it shred them.
---
for up close work stay away from Explosive guns, then will kill you a lot. A nice modded revolver is great as well. look for a AA with limb damage bonus 10mm or TS without the E. cya in the trenches.
---
I paid extra to see batman v superman opening night and I was so disgusted I puked a little in to my date's bag of popcorn. I didn't get a refund for the movie, the popcorn, the drinks beforehand, or the time I spent complaining afterwards. Nor did I ever think I would.
---
It's been confirmed by bethesda guys this guy is a liar and has been banned for duping as have all of the other people caught duping.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
If I may be honest I dont know if you will be happy yet. Judging by how you felt about the BETA I'm not sure there is a whole lot more here. 
---
From the other side of the short fence I can say I have enjoyed the game and continue to do so. Sure the recent patch brought some crazy balances (although it was needed) that I feel need to be tweaked a bit. Brought back some old bugs, some were mind blowing to see return and others, yes the bobby pin weight, who cares? I dont keep a ton on me so it made me sell the extras. 
---
I think the most disappointing thing for me is the lack of new content. However, I like so many others, are soon to forget that it has been out 3 months. FO4 released November 2015 and saw its first dlc March 2016. So we haven't even hit that time threshold yet and these are free DLCs this time around so why would they come sooner? Not to mention the amount of flak this game gets if the DLC is junk then more people will quit and wont return so hopefully they are actually taking their time to release something of quality that will extend the life until the one following the first. 
---
Yes this game has its flaws and should have maybe had a few more end game things to do but this was meant as a tip toe into a MMORPG that honestly tried to do way to much at first. I like how they are trying with patches, even if they fail miserably and seem to go backwards, they are trying. 
---
There is a lot to like in this game if you are a fan of the franchise. Being able to play a fallout experience with friends is really cool. It does turn into a grind but dont all games of this nature, even past fallouts, turn into them eventually and become gear hunters? 
---
I dont want to sound like I will defend this game or Bethesda to the end because it just isn't true. Why on earth the targeting HUD has been addressed, scorch beasts still get stuck in a float and spam sonic blast, a 5 rank perk card only gives 60% bonus, so on and so forth is beyond me but there still are more than one viable way to play despite what the masses say. I can still 1 shot most enemies in the game who are max level and those that I cant take 2 or 3 shots with exception to outright tanks like the mirelook queen, but isn't she supposed to be bad ass?
---
My point is there is still a very deep perk based system here where if you actually spec for one weapon type (outside of explosives right now) you can still be a wondering killing machine. You just have to work through some quarks and really dive into the perks, give up some strength to gain sneak bonus, lose some endurance to build vats, whatever it may be.
---
If the BETA made you not play until now maybe you should wait a bit honestly. They are still trying to iron out the game from its BETA stage and they are getting there it's just taking longer than it probably should be but they have made some really good changes that force you to pick a style and spec for it. Cant be awesome at 3 weapon types anymore which honestly is a good thing. If you do decide to try it out grab a buddy or find a friend and get to 50 with them. After is when it really opens up. 
---
Ha nice BGS. Great job
---
Meh, after the freedom of 76 I couldn't care play that amusement park on rail ride again. I got more joy out of building settlements and defining the. Then taking them over with raiders. Hoping they bring that to 76
---
There was even one guy that said they took all the dupers stuff and then was outraged at being banned. 
---
Was thinking about this today. Right after I salvaged something manually and had no clue what it was. 
---
To be blunt. then you're not actually looking at the items in the shop. There \*are\* some retreads, mostly in terms of armor paint, but there is also a lot of new items. But there is \*also\* a lot of people mindlessly parroting the "it was in the game before" garbage without actually looking.
---
As someone who thoroughly enjoys being able to have a shotguns strength build I have to vehemently disagree with moving shotguns to perception. Other than that most of these ideas don't seem bad. 
---
Yes they are
---
DAOC. Geeze. Memories.
---
I don't, its snipe or nothing
---
You missed the Black powder pistol.
---
This has been my experience too.
---
I've only ever seen a map come from a container once that wasn't an obvious dump by other players.
---
I have one, its extremely rare...  Do you have any rare outfits
---
Do you know how you lost it?
---
I think anyone that’s moderated anything immediately smelled bullshit when a handful of players cried bans while innocently doing what everyone else does lol. 
---
Rare like what?
---
Was in Fort Defiance and the same things was happening constantly. The other issue was corpses freezing in mid-air
---
Todd Howard here, while we apologize for the unsatisfactory experience you have received. We suggest purchasing items from the atomic shop to enrich your time in West Virginia, our current promotions for the Unstoppable! character costumes are limited time special items.
---
Oh can I join in level 48 
---
Often melee but sometimes I fall back to a fast ROF rifle with a shorter range scope to make it easier to target.
---
The thing is that none of my friends will even give the game a chance and they refuse the give it a try with me so I'm left by myself unfortunately.
---
I mean ummm not that I don't disagree with you but logically the horror stories would only start after BGS started doing about it right.... If there is no enforcement why would there be any kind of "innocent" victims. 
---
There are several problems that would have to be addressed before something like this gets added
---
1.Photos are saved to your device and not a cloud so other people would have to download them to see them which could cause longer load times
---
2.Because photos are saved to your device on pc you can go in and replace the photo with anything you want like porn. Imagine walking into a base and someone has a wall full of hentai
---
this could be easily fixed by making it so when you take a picture you can save a limited number to the cloud to be used in photo frames or saving to device so you could keep as many as you want but cant be used in photo frames.
---
EUREKA! by jove, I think you're on to something!
---
RNG from what I’ve seen. Most I’ve found are on enemies with a crown (and occasionally in safes you have to lock pick). 
---
You can also find a treasure map on the dead treasure hunter body that spawns in random enemy spots (I.e., where you go try to catch a pet with wasteland whisperer/animal friend) like u see the bridge south of Harper’s ferry west of treetops. But that’s like a 1/20 server hop chance. 
---
NERF OR NOTHIN 
---
I mean same here but sometimes I get caught in a sticky situation and I don’t have a lot of fallbacks 
---
Good rule of thumb is, don't believe it unless you've seen it yourself, or there's screenshots/video. I don't believe any of these "theres a new duping method!!!!" posts since the trade-steal hoax. 
---
Yea you enjoyed survival mode but I'd be willing to bet that's a small niche that enjoyed it.
---
It only took what, 2 days to prepare a response? Step up your game!  This game is falling a part and Devs act like nothing is wrong!  We don't want PR making these posts, we want Devs communicating with us.  If we can't even have server stability in 3 months, can we get refunds? I'm ready for one.  Bought the game day one, only to be kicked in the gut repeatedly by mismanagement and inability to correct basic issues.  
---
60+ disconnects over 20 days means you delivered a shit product. Make it right!
---
Oh, Todd, my only wish was that we had a game Monster Factory could destroy but you did that yourself.
---
ATOMS PLZ
---
I think maybe finally bethesda is understanding their customers a bit. Feedback recently has been better and the hotfix was pretty speedy tbh. I think if they added more end game content folks could overlook the bugs a bit. I think the people who love the game are just frustrated. The nerf on tse's seems to be the big one that angered everyone. Not because of the nerf (definitely needed) it was how much it took away from the devoted players, myself included. Total builds were destroyed with one fell swoop. Anyhow I love it enough to keep chugging away. Im at lvl 107 and I still have lots to do. I'm keeping the faith for a little while yet.
---
Ah. Ok with context it makes sense lol. 
---
Have a specific thing you're looking for? 
---
TIL
---
Theyll probably just nerf armo again to balance PvP for pistol users.
---
Bethesda has good marketing materials, that's for sure.
---
I'm in the same boat. I'll look for you guys as well - or add me - game name same as screen name here.
---
&gt; The scorchbeast doesn’t.
---
Savage as fuck!
---
Honestly I just panic shoot and usually just one shot most enemies if their overall health is low enough 
---
I have a bunch I'd sell for 100 caps apiece. Im on xbox
---
Well I played the "story" pretty much by myself. I did it so I could go at my own pace and listen to the holotapes which are actually very well done. Sure I ran a couple with others but 80% of the missions I did alone. The events are really where team play is at and now it's better since you dont have Dave one 1shotting every legendary so no one else can get loot. 
---
Still worth it to play through evening it is only a fourth of the story FO4 was. It wasnt meant to be the same style...cant fault it for not being something is wasnt designed to be from the start. 
---
For a mutant wouldn't be surprised he wanted a little upgrade
---
Right, I just prefer the human touch to it I guess. I don't really want Bethesda having to try to control this. 
---
You can polish shit all you want but its still going to be shit. If you dont see what is wrong with this game and Bethesda trade practices your as blind as a mole rat. Sure ive had fun in 76 as well but theirs a point when you finally realize that the world of 76 was put together in a little over a mouth with no heart or soul in it.  
---
Busted.
---
I promise you're not able to gain 150,000 flux/bobbleheads/nuka-cola/whatever (besides probably ammo) legitimately, even if you played every second of every day since release. 
---
They can do it and it will get you banned if your dumb enough to pick it up. Just ask my banned account. 
---
Nothing if value to respond with then. I expected as much. 
---
You sir, have hit the nail on the head.  If PR can putout a post to make Bethesda seem less at fault, BOOM! small win for them, still a loss long term as people stop logging on because my log on freezes....I open my pip boy too soon and freeze...I fast travel and I freeze...I launch a nuke and server disconnects....see the theme?  
---
This could have been addressed with a proper BETA...instead we got a BETA with the hours most kids go to school now. Leads me to believe the Devs are either 12, or paid part-time employees.

The problem is a generation that grew up with vanilla fallout and RPGS of pen and paper who transitioned into the RPGshooter of today- existing with the entitled generation that was introduced at fallout 3 when Bethesda took over. The folks of my generation were a bunch who accepted games good and bad. We didn't have a platform to demand so we had to accept the game and roll with it or move on. Now people get on the internet and act like ... It's a generational clash playing out here. I would wager the ones left standing who keep paying and keep the game moving are working people adults in their later 20s.. the ones who love on to the next big thing ( kingdomcraps or whatever) are young people who donated have patience to read. Who don't feel the stories tone and just over all need an animated pixel to arouse them to action or carrot them from point A to B. Without sidekicks to perv over or keep them focused.. they can't immerse themselves.. I dunno it's more complicated then that but games good. It's going in a good direction . I see minor bugs but nothing game breaking. Glad to see such a good series kept alone. Don't like what I'm saying? Cool come at me on PS4. I'm Agent_August. I'll be on till maybe 2 am. You can discourse with tile words or guns cause I'm definitely not even looking at responses on here.. just the same broken record..
---
No idea. I was looting and fairly certain I didn't drop them. I didn't die, so it wasn't dropped that way. I've experienced the missing PA piece issue before, but it only unequipped a piece before, not completely removed it from my inventory.
---
It's doable, but you'll be popping a lot of radaway. At first I hope this was an oversight, but it's glaring enough to seem deliberate. I'm just scratching my head at why they bothered with the rad Sheild quests in the first place if it's not going to help you bypass the Hazmat suit.
---
Pallet swaps and costumes require the same effort as genuine new content? \*checks Nexus mods for FO4, notices how many costumes there are vs content additions\* Yah sure? Never mind that a lot of the atom shop stuff was probably done during the long period between "core content done" and "release." Or did you think the art/asset workers just sat on their bums collecting pay during all that time?
---
Quit assuming every worker in a company is a faceless number with identical skills that you can shuffle around between jobs at a whim like Game Dev Tychoon.
---
I’ve mentioned it before that an older browser based MMO called Runescape had such a system well over a decade ago and it covered any item in the game. If Bethesda can’t make that work nowadays for only a fraction of the items, then they really need to reassess what they’re doing in the software industry. 
---
I throw down frag mines before I shoot and if my cover gets blown they usually run right into them. 1 handed melee is my last resort. I have quite a few gladiator perks and incisor, blocker.
---
What about the DEV room items. Can you confirm or deny you are banning people for having these? I honestly have no idea which items are legitimate and which are Contraband.
---
Had I not been active on Reddit I would never have know about this issue and honestly would have bought the first Winterized plans I could find.  It is my lack of knowing what is contraband that prevents me from buying or traded with most players.
---
What is happening to players that have "Learned" Illegal Plans?
---
Yes it was TY OP.
---
No. Bad idea is bad. 
---
&gt;But I'm about to lose it.

lmao do they literally need to come to your house and fuck your asshole for you finally call it quits?

Combat rifle modded for hip-fire accuracy. It benefits from the same perks as hunting rifle if you don’t modify it to be automatic.

Lmao the goodness of our hearts? I play because I enjoy the game. Sounds like you’re doing it wrong. 
---
I haven't logged in for a few weeks but I had tens of thousands of halloween candy, they aren't rare and have no weight.  If you are actually banning people for having 500k halloween candy you are fucking idiots, people just level up right there.  This dev team is a joke, this game is going up in flames because of your incompetence 
---
Its not awful,and does seem to stagger enemies but yah not having any perks for it is lame.
---
But it was already in fallout 4. Seems like if they are gonna throw in glitches from the last game, they should at least give us the good stuff from it too!
---
Good on ya mate! I guess one would consider me a more casual gamer. I get excited for games and rarely put money down on them immediately. I was super excited for this and  got bamboozled. I can’t garner the energy to wait almost three months only for the game to revert. I paid my money and I have to accept that. Bethesda is going to have to really work me to get my money again. If I am going to get whipped, I’d rather keep it in the bedroom rather than my wallet.
---
Let's be honest with ourselves. We need to game 100% working before we can ask for QoL things.

Bethesda would be best to implement such a feature compared to any other publisher/studio.

4) At seemingly random times any time from just logging in to having played a while, I get "Disconnected From Server" message and get kicked out of the world I was in.  When I Play again, I have no way yo get back to the world I was in, so workshops are lost and progress of clearing and area is lost.  If I at least had the option to rejoin the same world (without having teamed up) I could try to resume where I was.  I also would not have to relog multiple times to find a world where my CAMP site is available. 
---
This happens at least once every time I play.  If I play for many hours, it can happen 3 or more times.  I'd say this is the number one problem currently discouraging my Fallout 76 play time.
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that enjoyment of the game is only available after real money micro transactions.
---
It’s blueprints 
---
Already get her?
---
Two separate teams iirc. One smashing bugs and the other creating new bugs... uh... content. 
---
Bethesda, this is whatvwe wa... No need, to hear.
---
Keep us in the loop. Thats what a lot of us have been asking for.
---
&gt; It's doable, but you'll be popping a lot of radaway.
---
I was hoping to even bypass that since it disables my mutations..
---
Takes literally 3-5 mins to get 250ish candy (total round) so wtf your talking about 10s of thousands legit? Dude if your trying to fake shit up at least math it up before you do. Unless your telling me you spend the last 40h hours farming that place non stop
---
I never used it in Fallout 3 due to a bug where it made the game crash.In 4 it was awesome.
---
The problem is because of base carry weight (155+ STx5) in 76 vs (200+STx10) in fallout 4. Devs didn’t scale item weights down enough to compensate for this in my opinion.
---
I got a bloodied pipe pistol with 25% reduced vats energy used and 25% increased fire rate, low health I can down a scorchbeast with a vats crit spam with about 10 rounds. This is with .38 ammo too.

IMO it's the best spot to level up in the game between xp, and legendaries dropping.  Plus you gets tons of meds in the process, the place is a goldmine
---
alot of weapons dont make sense the Quantum Grenade as the blast radius of a dime but the Nuka grenade can clear a whole building.
---
I just did a queen run maybe an hour ago with a few people. I personally only want to launch nukes as a means of gathering materials to make Ultracite ammo. The massive amounts of XP are gone (though Whitesprings is still very farmable), TSE nerf makes the queen harder, people still salty over legendaries/queen drops not loading, it just all gets very tiresome.
---
Did I micro transact good daddy Todd 
---
But that would mess with the melee meta!I seriously think the team in charge of balance love melee and despise Energy weapons.
---
They need someone who actually understand the weapons, perks, and play styles on their team :(
---
Honestly you should just save yourself the time and money.

They fucked us

Click on "Game Options" in the Bethesda Launcher, uninstall *SHOULD* be there
---
TOS says if you mess with the game your account is subject to punishment, they never specified what falls under it. Also if you use your head, calculate the maximum humanly possible stack some1 could have obtained through legitimate means, anything that exceeds it would be obviously obtained through illegal means. It's simple logic.  
---
And don't come with what if some crazy story like : "15 players traded 10k of those items with you", cause that shit makes no sense either. Why would you in your rightfully mind need over 10k of any kind of item on this game (beside the carry weight  would literally pin you on the floor)
---
As far as I know, you're correct. White Springs is a busy location, and there's usually lots of players in/around at least the lower-level train stations, so items placed in containers there stand a good chance of lasting longer.
---
I once found a BIG BUNCH of someone's duplicate recipes in a suitcase outside Charleston Station.
---
ArenaNet just had to do this with their faulty mass bans from early 2018
---
Wow. Clearly this is a real problem for you. 
---
Not necessarily....some duper logs in and realizes they cant move now due to the new max wt rule, so they drop a bunch of stuff.  some newb comes by and thinks it is his lucky day, could find himself red flagged for have all that stuff. But it is good to know that the "excessive" junk criteria they have set is high enough that you really need to guilty or dumb to get caught up in it.
---
So that is the only system in the game that is bug free 
---
&gt; player initiates a trade with someone
---
Wait, you can't just inspect save game states?  You need actual play reports about people hoarding stuff?
---
Come on.
---
That's the most amateur thing I've heard of.
---
Are you telling me that save games aren't being tracked so you can actually tell when these items magically appeared, where the players were, etc etc?
---
You shouldn't need user reports to see people's inventories, or how the freaking got the items, especially with duping being a thing.  Just as it should be easy enough to know if there was a pvp event leading to a kill and someone suddenly picking up a dupe farmers stuff.
---
My god do you even do logging?  Audits?
---
The mind boggles.
---
Do I need to send in a resume or something?
---
Look I got out of IT because I was tired of the ineptitude, but jeez, guys in a multiplayer anything you can't trust anyone, or anything (not even your engine) checpoint/save state, and diff it, track changes.  You show know who is where, and where they have been at all times.
---
That does seem to be the case but that's not what they reported in the Inside the Vault post. They made it clear that it was no longer randomised. Well, the intent for it to be that way anyhow.
---
I guess we'll have to see how this all plays out.
---
Me and my partner have given up playing. We don't have time to waste to wait for a game to be fun. Currently moved on to some new releases and never looking back! We loved the story of the franchise but at this point i can catch up on what little there is on YouTube and move on with my life. I just hope we win the lawsuits and can get our money back. I am waking up to how cautious I need to be purchasing, both of us promising to never preorder a game or buy it within it's first month ever again. I am also valuing these indie games with heart that aren't bogged down with empty space and tricks to waste maximum time for least reward. Thank you Bethesda for helping a generation become more resilient and prepared to fight for our rights and what we deserve as consumers. Too bad all we wanted was a game that was worth what we paid for and were advertised. 
---
Then we would use them as free fast travel points
---
Todd Howard is pleased, but not pleased enough to fix the game.
---
So true 
---
A lot of the issues seem to be outright laziness,to downright malicious.Its been months and Laser durability has not been adressed at all.
---
I haven't logged in for days...  Started playing dead island and just pretending it's a fallout game.
---
Dont worry bro u will probably get 200 atoms as compensation 
---
I don’t ever PVP or really go after the queen. So I have no need for any legendary armor. They’re nice to have but I don’t rely on any. 
---
You specified Halloween candy as rare, but I've earned over 15k in a few days. You can earn over 1000 in a run, and the event takes less than 20 minutes.

There is a workbench at the end of the glassed caverns, after the elevator.

Ive gotten 11 syringers from "Legendary" enemies...one of them was even a 3star ghoul...
---
Thanks for the name drop. 
---
&gt; Devs are either 12, or paid part-time employees.
---
At this point I can't tell.
---
It's like they have never used their own engine before, never played FO4/NV/3 and just assumed that 'its perfect as is' and that 'exploits would never happen'.
---
If someone is going around and harassing me, there should be pvp logs showing they killed me 50 times, I shouldn't need to file a freaking report with any proof, they should know.
---
If someone pvp's a farmer, and takes their shit, they should have known the farmer was farming.
---
How do they obviously NOT HAVE ANY LOGGING?!  It's bizarre.
---
I'm thinking you're a fucking idiot who doesn't realize you're making the same point I am. 
---
Nooooooo not my chems sorry but once a junkie always a junkie lol ill sell my nuka cola's tho since im a alcoholic 
---
Limiting stashes by number of distinct items rather than total weight of all items makes sense and would be totally fine by me. That should also incentivize specialization and thus trading, and improve economic efficiency.
---
This is a half-baked thought but I wonder if workshops should just be nixed and let CAMPs be built in resource-rich locations. Takeovers could force you to move your CAMP or try to retake the location; if you joined a server where someone else was set up there you could choose a different server or move your camp for free; and resource extractors and defenses wouldn't have to be rebuilt every time you relogged (or got disconnected…). Like I said, half-baked, but it's a thought.
---
Going off on a tangent but I think this is fundamental to how we play: if locations and combat were more dynamic and lucrative, workshops would matter less. We'd explore more, be more on our toes, and farm/grind less if we didn't know exactly how many of what was going to spawn where at a given location. If I knew Whitesprings Golf Club and Tyler County Dirt Track had equal chances of spawning anything from zero to a horde of deathclaws, ghouls, more rats, or super mutants, I'd move around a lot more. There are good reasons to restrict the spawns at certain locations, but many could be much more dynamic.
---
And how about more wandering mobs like Grahm? If a roving pack of deathclaws could wander into Grafton at any time, I'd spend more time observing my surroundings (or following them to see what they'd do when they met a roving pack of super mutants). I'll stop rambling now.
---
The TOS is extremely open ended. They reserve the right to terminate/suspend anyone's account at their sole discretion. It also explicitly states that you can get banned for you actions in-game or on forums and extends to anything that violates the "spirit" of said terms of service. Just fyi, this is par for the course and not at all unique to Bethesda.
---
As for the single player games, I'm not sure tbh. I imagine it would definitely apply to say mod support on fo4 but I don't know if it would lock you out of playing those games completely. Perhaps someone else could chime in on that
---
Bet it was a level 15 wooden leg too.
---
As much as I wanna say thats funny I really can't my patience wears thin finding less of a reason to wanna play almost every day and I wanna love this game.
---
I don't think they know how, I mean they did the TS(e) "balancing" in the single most backwards and difficult way possible.  
---
The easy fix would have been just adjusting the legendary effect itself 
---
Yeah, that's the other thing...other locations can be server-hop farmed very quickly, even if the total is lower...it can take twenty minutes to search that damn place for nothing. 
---
Thanks Obama
---
Not to nitpick but Charleston is a responder bot, not raider. 
---
And this would make runs through Whitesprings and the Enclave great for cap farming as there’s multiple vendors in each. 
---
I’d rather have a barter system like in FO4 that allows you to set up a large trade for multiple items at once, leveraging a multitude of items to purchase an expensive item when strapped for caps. I’d also like to see the bullshit 1:4 cap return on purchased items eliminated.  If I gave the vendor 100 caps, he should now have whatever he had plus those 100 instead of 75 of them disappearing into some unknown plane of oblivion.

A lot of my pieces give “-15% damage from supermutants” (which is REALLY nice) or SPECIAL increases

Why can’t they give a neutral coloured scout armour with legendary effects

You gotta let it go man

If  your neighbors or parents are the right age to have seen "10" back in the day, they're likely to think you're having sex when Ravel's "Bolero" comes on.

It's probably not a disease. That happens when you have the strange in numbers perk on but no one else in your team.
---
The simple fact that they cannot inventory who has what just blows my mind.
---
Possibly, but this company been doin bad stuff, too, so we should safely trust neither haha
---
Can you just turn these players into Ferrel Ghouls and let's shoot them to start the banning process. All they can do is run an stumble about until we kill them.
---
Ya, I  hear you. I bought rdr2 in October and played that until Christmas. I bought FO76 on sale for $30 on Amazon right after Thanksgiving and didn't install it until I quit playing rdr2 online. I definitely don't have as much time invested. You could probably get a preowned copy of that(rdr2) and give it a spin! It's a great game!! At least the single player anyway. Then see what happens with FO76.
---
Oh wow hours of trying to make that work and this was the fix. Thanks.

Hello. i would like to report a issue regarding teams. PS4 is the platform.
---
Since the beta i've had this nasty bug where i cant join teams.
---
players cant accept my invite eventually causing the invite to time out.
---
and i dont retrieve invites under teams or invite notifications from players.
---
i would appreciate any awareness to this problem. Thank you.
---
I run a lot of those perk cards. Using the mod that allows for card profiles. I have a "fast travel" loadout with all the carry weight mods, plus the "travel cheaper" charisma card. 
---
But when I'm in a zone running around? I'm running a combat build that's all of my damage mod cards. 
---
I mean lets be fucking real here...a maxed out shotgun build leaves damn near _nothing_ left even with maxed out str. Most of the carry weight mods are str mods as well. 
---
Indeed sad thing is even if I report this theres nothing they will do and thats what hurts the most when they sure as hell can they just wont and anyone who says different is a liar I've never played an online game where the devs didn't have acess or controls to such things.
---
Yeah the TSE nerf also pretty much ruined all vanilla explosive weapons.
---
Props for speaking out, and I largely agree..  
---
I remember working my ass off to scrounge up every screw and every bit of aluminum I could to build the excavator suit
---
Worth the effort but I only use it to farm lead and even then I’ve got enough to last me a long while

how it feels to be ranged and face a scorchbeast [https://imgur.com/gallery/3Myc47r](https://imgur.com/gallery/3Myc47r)
---
Nah only one switch works. Otherwise the second switch wont work. Not sure if a bug. But Switch/Terminal combo works, as /u/aznavour-00 stated.
---
Yeah quite likely. At any rate...I didn't start hanging out in that zone until about 45, due to the constant surge of high level mobs. I got that quest completed long ago. 
---
If you're using rifles, the Tesla is a great backup. It's damage is a little low, but if you're getting swarmed by weaker mobs, it can wipe them all out in the blink of an eye. Also, you don't really need to aim it.
---
I'm just telling it how I've been experiencing it, assuming the servers doing well enough to actually load her loot the legendaries only pop up after the event. I play on pc.
---
That was awesome.  Thanks for the invite.  Now I have an even, dozen Ultracite Explosive Vents (haha).
---
Yes indeedy! Just slap on that Pharma Farma.
---
I think you may have pushed yourself away no? That's alot of time to sink into something and not enjoying it? I've found myself enjoying my games more when I just go at a nice pace instead of "grinding" them out. What kills games for alot of people and myself is reading to much into the meta pr whatnot instead of just sitting back and having fun.
---
Launched my first nuke at Whitespring today. 5 minutes in I blue screened. Logged back in, and froze up on spawn. Turned it off. 
---
Yeah I'm not sure if I feel like playing RDR2 again just yet..I just got Metro Redux in from eBay..I may just throw in FF12 ZA again..farm the special armors/equipment there..but I feel like I did a lot in this game..I got to experience:
---
*whitesprings (most of my time there)
---
*the other day finally fought the queen (with my level 10 alt lol..I think the other players were mad at me she was taken down in 8 mins)
---
*fun with my TSE for about a month
---
*gave items to whomever passed me by
---
* crafted marsupial with my recipe but never used it..should try it out
---
*got the mr fuzzy costume
---
over 200 hours but I'm done for now..have the physical disk I think I'm definitely throwing FF12 in tonight
---
Yet I got banned for having shit I killed and stole from dupers, I took no part in duping but thanks anyway. Your goal was obviously to get people to buy your bugged as game again since you need all the sales  you can get.
---
Had 2 tonight. I launched one. 
---
Nah I was server hopping for gears with my camp next to deathclaw island. Was laughing too hard to look for it.
---
Dude, a few weeks is waaaay too long. I just had my first load in about 47 hours, and it was too damn long.
---
Yeah I’m just not gonna trust a word that Bethesda says until they earn it back with you know a functioning game. 
---
They're selling their product at market value, making them merchants. 
---
An analogy for this would probably be spices. Incredibly valuable several hundred years ago, a commodity sold for low prices now. That doesn't make the people who sell spices any different from those who sold spices before, just much less rich. 
---
People who sell 3*'s for dirt cheap are doing so because there is an over-saturation in the market and the 3*'s are valued that low. Unfortunately for you, that means that 3*'s are practically baseline and everything below it has little to no demand. 
---
The 'dealers' are those selling TSE weapons for real money, since the entire process from duping to selling is illegitimate. 
---
I rely on legendary drops, depending on level and material. If I don’t like the look, I wear an outfit. Fashion is good, but big numbers are better.
---
No jetpack no headlamps
---
Considering you can do 3 rounds with enough ppl inside for "600" in a go, before swapping servers thats 15 mins for 2K. Now you need to hop servers to get up to a new one with the event up. Get lucky to have enough ppl to join you before you ramp up the event, let's say you spend up 5 mins doing all that. That means you can do 3 cycles per hour netting "6k". Now the reward of the candy is capped at 3k . So stacking 150k is kinda dumb, but fine lets imagine some1 wants to do it. Still takes 24+H of playing it without breaks. Unless your a bot, or you really need help in your life. Farming all that candy is not doable in a regular play through. And thats with your 600ish number that i feel like not being doable regularly.
---
Did you scrap are drop them accidentally?
---
no problem ! i’ll hit you up if there’s another queen, the explosive vents and rusty knuckles have your name on em ;)
---
That’s good for you, Bethesda employee #36
---
Could not agree more...  
---
The explosive legendary effect should have never been a secondary (Major) effect, and whoever though that was a good idea should be, well given a dunce cap..  
---
A dead easy fix would be:  
---
-Restoring the perks, TS and explosive to pre-Nef. 
---
-cloning the original explosive legendary, changing it to the Prefix (primary) slot, and tweak so at most the explosive perks effect it at 50% (adjust from there).  
---
-Adjust the Secondary (Major) version of the legendary effect so it does not benefit from the demo perks at all, leaving it still the most powerful secondary effect, but capped at 25 points. Remove it from the table for future drops.
---
That has absolutely nothing to do with this. In fact, when you do that she seems to fly away more often.
---
I have the same problem. My stored budget says 150% and I have nothing in my stored category. I can't build anything! Have u found a fix?

But man the robot arm I have gives me the ability to breath underwater! How could I get rid of it?!?
---
E3 will start off with a release date for new Doom game instantly win audience in there corner then we will get a update on blades then starfield then elder scrolls maybe something about 76 since E3 is in what june in 4 months alot can happen in 4 months so yes i expect todd howard to come out but instead of everyone bending over for a ass fucking this year it will just be a unenthusiastic blow job unless he announces they have a new engine then everyone panties will hit the floor so hard California will finally break off the USA
---
It means you have a shit build
---
Can't argue 
---
This is where im at. Theres just nothing to do. Ive visited most every location and have just about every plan. The only thing to do is farm more legendaries and pray for a good drop. 
---
You can't scrap legendaries and I know I didn't sell them. And it took a lot of work to get that sheilded wetsuit when I got it I'm very careful with it as I can't craft it.
---
So the remaining 3,000 players of this game are just making excuses for Bethesda? Sad, man, they don’t care about you, just your money.
---
Am I the only player who switches to Classical Radio the moment the intro to "Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition" comes on? That is the song on Appalachia Radio that wore out its welcome the day I started playing the game.
---
It just works
---
Am I missing something are you saying this person is "rich" just because they can buy 2 games? That's like 120 dollars right ? 120 dollars is hardly anything in today's society yeah ?
---
nice!   sounds good!
---
Can't buy that theory, they've had nothing by trouble implementing fixes, he'll they are not using fixes that people are spoon feeding them.  
---
I have a sinking feeling the people making the changes are not pro's with the Creation Engine
---
Agreed, any multiplayer game does this at this point for such reasons.  Oversight of such a thing means someone isn't doing their job.  I LOVE this franchise and like this game....but this is becoming negligence.  "Hot" fix to only roll-back the game...is no one beta testing these patches?  This screams mismanagement at the very least.  
---
Side note: Props to the marketing team, you guys killed it for this game.
---
Management...not so much. 
---
&gt; Considering you can do 3 rounds with enough ppl inside for "600" in a go
---
It isn't difficult to do this at all, unless you're just killing the shit out of them and making them leave.
---
&gt;et lucky to have enough ppl to join you before you ramp up the event, let's say you spend up 5 mins doing all that
---
Why would you waste time?  Just log in, do the event, switch servers.  The whole process is about 5 mins each time.  
---
There is nothing dumb about stacking them, it is food that has no weight and doesn't spoil
---
I strongly disagree. There is nothing "legendary" about mass produced items. The game throws already too many of so called legendaries our way, it doesn't feel remotely special. The game is too easy as it is.
---
Both of you need to be brought out back and beaten with hoses
---
if you have any treasure maps, go find them and dig. i get addictol at least 50% of the time. i never need them so i just sell them to vendors
---
But that's not going to help at this point, because the duper's know that, and they at cloning higher "value" items in smaller numbers.  
---
It's gorilla warfare..
---
I found a normal dog next to a food bowl at the top of cliff. It was next to what I assume was the skeletons of it's former owners. They were sitting in two lawn chairs overlooking a whole valley. The whole scene made me melancholy. It was great storytelling via simple scene without any holos or notes.
---
And they still haven't given us a freaking crafting slider.   
---
Doing what should take 5 minutes instead takes 30 or 40 minutes
---
If you read they said they have other methods to which they will not post here
---
You don't have to clarify anything at all.  Anyone that has been around online gaming in particular MMOs knows that many attempt to cry innocence on forums saying how wronged they were when they get hit with a ban.  Only fools fall for their tears.  Keep it up Bethesda.  Exploiting in online games is a slap in the face to other players and the games developers.  
---
Nice..what type of stat boosts do the omelette give u if eaten?
---
Pretty smart 
---
I think Whitesprings is meant to be the player hub, but the high level ghouls present on the property discourage this/it’s not really advertised. 
---
You could also build at unmarked locations, like the windmill near grafton. The windmill comes with an armor workbench, so all you need to do is please down a stash box. I go to white springs for any specialized crafting.
---
Same here, outfits just straight up disappear off my character. I dont look for clean outfits anymore, just atom store shit that I can recraft as needed.
---
Had this happen earlier, went to sell my bulk after farming a few super Mutants and found it all gone. 
---
&gt;Some will no doubt defend this as reasonable, realistic. etc.
---
Lets hope not.
---
I thought that some of these funny songs were made just for the games.   Fun fact: they are all real songs. Including two left hands. 
---
Hah well in his defense, he was trying to get you to plan things out so you could budget out costs which would be useful if you went into a career. Not so fun when you just want to get to making, i on the other hand enjoy the design aspect but damn those drawings can get tedious. 
---
I noticed that myself the other day when I was checking out Grafton to see what all the vendors were offering now.
---
I have all the plans already learned but wanted to pick up some extras for my friends and just didnt see them.
---
It still seems like theres still an RNG element to how some plans and mods display in vendors inventories.
---
Im level 95, and have gotten all three plans at the Grafton vendors over the last 30 levels.
---
Nukes are launched less because the silo skip was patched. Proper queen killers are not affected by the TSE nerf, as we do not use TSE weapons.
---
I've heard that.  Never played WOW, so only real experience was the D3 version.
---
1. PC
---
2. don't need
---
3. don't need
---
4. the marathoner perk card only works without power armor (even though the perk card does not designate as a 'no power armor' perk)
---
5. no need
---
Yeah but then depending on the event, some people might fuck off until the very end and get full credit, which can be annoying to some considering they coulda helped the entire time
---
Honestly, I downvoted this because it is literal idiocy...
---
You basically said " People didn't start whining about getting banned until the game company started banning people."
---
No shit...
---
thx m8
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that this is a gameplay balancing feature and not a bug.
---
Zealots Gatling 5mm with a 500 found mag ain’t bad.  I just wish the ring sight worked. 
---
yeah
---
I did, and I'm aware, but I'm also very confident that at this point the dupers are causing the "market crash" on purpose.  
---
Tracking people duping singles, or even 20 of something is going to be allot more challenging than 1,000.  
---
Any method that would track crafting, or what is picked up from a bag etc would net hundreds of innocent players.
---
I believe I got down voted about 30 times when I accused the last tear streaked, hand wringing banned player coming here pleading his innocence.  Now apologise and upvote me.  NOW!
---
&gt; accounts that have managed to collect over 500,000 (in some cases, tens of millions) of specific rare items 
---
Your bosses should be ashamed of the state the game was launched to be abused this way.
---
Said this, thanks for taking actions against the dupers. A Little late, as those miserable individuals destroyed a promising in-game economy.
---
And thanks for clarifying that legit hoarders (like me) will be safe. 
---
it wasnt, all praise the holy hole in the wall!
---
&gt; Even in this example, though, with Herculean effort to make pistols viable
---
??? It's not any harder than making rifles or other gun builds viable. Rifles get 36% armor pen from perks. Not much when considering how the system works. Weapons require a shitload of base damage **or** armor pen to work effectively, and you can get both of those things through either vats/crits or legendary weapons. Same for any gun, not just pistol. Honestly, heavy weapons get a bad rap imo because they're not as weak as this community makes them out to be. Sure the majority of them are trash, but so are the majority of all weapons regardless of type. I had an easier time making my heavy weapons build viable than I did with my rifle build.
---
For reference, an anti armor rifle with the perk stacked on top of it gets 68% armor pen while the pistol has the flat 50%. Not a tremendous change for any situation other than SBQ. In fact, I did a lot of testing on deathclaws with summerset vs standard .44 snubnose and they did practically the same damage. DR doesn't really affect most mobs in this game by much other than scorchbeasts, mirelurk queens and a few other big nasty outliers. I haven't fully completed my pistol build but I'm working on a chain black powder pistol build(shoot one switch to the next). I have an instigating bpp, TS bpp and an executioners bpp as well as an aa/explosive .44 to finish anything off or get it to executioners threshold. I've been putting this build off because I wanted to finish my heavy weapon gunner first. Kind of sad I did because half of what I wanted to do with it has been nerfed.
---
I can't tell you how much I've wished I could place those figurines you can find, as decorations in my camp..
---
If you really need a dense chest piece, you can craft and scrap level 1 leather chest pieces until you get the mod.
---
craftammo 76 and bulletsponge 76 are pretty dead on. i usually go on in the morning and craft enough ammo and clear my stash so when i go on layer to play its actually enjoyable. 
---
How exactly are we supposed to save up for a store with the hard cap on all accounts?  
---
The majority of the players who had been making stores have already abandoned the whole process, because this weeks patch kneecapped them all.
---
They most likely flag accounts that like instantly get certain amount of items in a alotted time
---
I’ve got technical data and I can’t put it in and can’t get the quest?
---
I like how instead of respec you spelled respect. I honestly think it would be great if Bethesda showed fans more respect
---
It’s Xbox, but I do have a keyboard plugged in lol, it worked next load 
---
I rely on random legendary drops. One of the best ways to get what you're looking for is to swing by the vendors near a nuke site. People sell stuff and sometimes leave it in a container of sorts. There isn't really a superior armor, including PA, for pvp, so don't worry about that. You want armor that suits your build. Finding good armor with multiple legendary attributes is a challenge, but if you simply play the game, you will find it one way or another. 
---
If you prefer to be fully healed at all times, you might like Vanguard. Low health? Bolstering or Unyielding. PA is always a solid choice, but don't believe for one second it's the best. It's all relative to what you're trying to achieve. If you want to stay away from PA, definitely look into the defensive perks. In the long term, there are a couple of mutations worth looking at that boost defense significantly.
---
Just take it one piece at a time, play the game, and you'll end up getting what you need.
---
Ive been the same level since patch, and at watoga I sometimes see heavy chest, then another day I saw heavy arms and another server hop or a few later I saw heavy legs, so I think there is still some rng
---
Hey bud, I respect that it's your topic and all, but no it's not fine, and I don't appreciate you trying to brush me off when I took pains to provide some needed info. 
---
The rad resist value in your pit boy is virtually meaningless.
---
Just tried out my stealth sniper with 17 agility... after an hour of testing I found zero issue.
---
Stealth sniper with marsupial, speed demon, scaly skin, and adrenal reaction.  
---
Chameleon armor with armor that has +sneak legendary.
---
No change since last patch and hotfix.  
---
Prior to patch, burrowing enemies always instant detect you so anyone posting this does so pointlessly as it is a seperate issue.
---
I also have experienced times where I am stuck in danger.  Sneaking far from any mobs typically resets to hidden or I server hop.
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that item security is not a guarantee and only items purchased through the atomic shop are saved to the credit card holders account.
---
As much more fun as I think FO4 and 76 are with a Two Shot weapon, that's only because the mobs are so spongy, and Two Shot never made sense to me anyway.
---
Not that I'm under any illusions about Fallout trying to be realistic, but since we're talking about what makes sense, you can't double the damage (if we can say that's ballistic energy) of a cartridge by packing two bullets into it. You either wind up with a lot less gunpowder, or smaller bullets. Two Shot never made sense.
---
Even if much of the Fallout universe is fantastical (and should be), I do think New Vegas with its variety of ammo types did this better. Legendary effects for things like weight (could be made of exotic materials), etc. are believable, cool, and valuable; but the ones that magically make your ammo armor-piercing, explosive, or double the ballistic energy don't make sense, and on a more practical note they send us grinding for TSE etc. when we could be using strategy and tactics to craft and select the best ammo for a given fight.
---
I know this won't gain any traction now that we've all tasted legendary damage modifiers, but with Two Shot and Explosive neutered anyway … why not?
---
Bethesda said it'd take something like 5-6 months. We still have a ways to go.
---
Big oof 
---
1. Loot sucks, explosive vents no thanks
---
2. Xp nerfed
---
3. Queen buffed via nerfing tse
---
4. Server lag and crashes means haha sucks to be you after wasting ammo and keycard
---
5. Corpse poofs into meat pile then you have to look for red hamburger patty on red ground
---
6. My 2 good characters are at weight limit honestly
---
7. Game patches and glitches have turned game time into hair pulling time
---
8. No end game besides Queen.
---
9. Right now it literally is more entertaining to complain than to play the game.
---
10. Queen fucks off and you cant finish the fight.
---
11. #1-10 applies to many players and now less and less people join Queen fights and less people initiate Queens.
---
Piss off Todd ya damn troll ;)
---
Aww. You think the BBB is anything and can do anything. 
---
This doesn't seem appropriate for the internet
---
Theyre worthless now
---
Noice
---
I shoot enemies in caution and still get the sneak damage bonus
---
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition, can't afford to not kill a communist praise the lord and pass the ammunition and we will all stay free. Its like my grand pa used too say those unions ain't nothing but a hot bed for godless communist and the mob 
---
[eye roll] It's rated mature, thus, not a childs game.  Any way, that's still no excuse for not doing their jobs right.  Sloppy coding is sloppy coding, irregardless of what excuses you seem to want to make for them.
---
Won't work, at all..  
---
**Example:**  
---
My last day playing was Monday (I did an average of 4 hours a day, max of 12, until Tuesday patch), ending with a WhiteSprings run (nuked).  
---
I collected more than 9,000 pounds of legendary, junk and vanilla items to scrap for mod chance in 2 hours. A few hundred Legendaries.   
---
How exactly can they do a "you've gotten to many items" filter when players can legitimately pick up 20 legendary items in 5 minutes, and 1,000 pounds of misc junk?
---
I never thought about doing the venders near nukes that’s a pretty cool idea 
---
I lost 5 Unarmed bobbleheads that I bought from an ingame vendor.  1,500 caps (at least)
---
Would be awesome too bad I would be worried if they could wven implement that correctly.
---
Actually they hate the Peoples Republic of China there are two the good one is the Republic of China (Taiwan) 
---
i cant believe this is still a bug. rip your stuff
---
Just want the option to ware the T51. 
---
Teleport 
---
It's forbidden,  duh
---
Hell, we put the 1* - 3* we didn't want in the icebox for people to take, and low levels would swing by and pick up hundreds of legendary items in a second.  
---
Ban those poor guys?
---
Oh nooooo
---
lol yea right, the moment they do they will get shredded by everyone and WILL make them the second most downvoted comment in reddit history lmfao.
---
I like it because it reminds me to stay strong to defeat fascism, 'Shenandoah' is the one that makes me switch immediately. Mostly because it's too depressing
---
Hmmm that must be new if it is. Also the queen doesn't really drop mods, that must be new too.
---
Are you sure you didn't get plans, but see the names thinking their mods. Checked your mods inventory and think you lost them?
---
I know that's right! I keep a good supply of Psychobuff on hand at all times, but the rest gets sold. My primary money maker!
---
And if Bethesda is watching, can we get the "FUCKING KILL!" audio bit back? That would be freaking awesome!
---
Happens about 3/4 times out of 10 for me 
---
If a build has similar special stats, like rifleman and commando, or gunslinger and commando, you can just level up and acquire the perk cards for that build. Also, if you allowed more character slots, players could have more mule accounts, since players are now caped at carry weight + 1500
---
I run with a Lever action sniper sadly it is bloodied which does nothing for me except not accidentally get scrapped.  An instigating Balck Powder Rifle for that sneaky first shot on a tough target, and an Anti-Armor handmade as my in close back up.  I do also have a vampire Assultron blade to kill annoy things and heal me up in some fights.  I try to stick to just rifles, I wish short barrels dropped weight instead of adding it WTF?
---
Issue:  I bought the Nuka Girl rocket suit while still in BETA.   I've worn it ever since,  Live in a house across from the Nuka Plant,  and have completely dedicated gameplay to developing Nuka Girl as a character. But....   Now,  if I wear combat armor chest pieces,  it shows through my Nuka Suit.  
---
It's unbecoming of a lady to wear her armor on the outside of her Nuka Suit.  
---
You should have gotten some kind of plans from it as well as a weapon or armor piece. Given that it sucks to have that happen I always take a stealth boy and hazmat suit with me during scorched earth and silo runs when I know I'm going to drop on the queen. It's not noble or anything like that but it secures your loot if you are low on health or over encumbered. Also it helps to die in one of the tunnels and not ask for help with the emote. People will stand their and wait for you to die then take your stuff. 
---
Legit
---
Sweeping Edge.
---
Oops, wrong game.
---
I'm sure a few billion less items getting churned and transferred around their systems will help on that, won't it?
---
I'd never heard of it. Googled the Wikipedia and since Roger Ebert thinks it's on par with Pink Panther, I'm going to have to check it out
---
There are much more useless things to sell to get 1400 a day from vendors. And getting rich with a limit of 1400 a day isn't quite no time.
---
I want them to improve rose’s raider radio like adding songs similar to the nukaworld radio station 
---
Not a melee player here, but that makes good sense.
---
Im 185 and I just have no motivation to play this game anymore. I literally spent weeks trying to get a Jetpack in the wild... I found the T45 and that was amazing. There is no reason to grind anymore.
---
He's saying that people didn't start claiming to being innocent until they started banning people for cheating 
---
Personally I believe they can, I just cannot see any experienced developer making that kind of mistake. It is 2019 and MMOs have been in place since the release of UO in 1997. Cheaters, hackers and dupers have been doing this before many programmers where born. 
---
Thus games have had to come up with certain basic MINIMAL security concepts to prevent this stuff.  Either BETH rejected ALL those past lessons or the are pretending to have.  I am sure they have many tools to track stuff but are keeping this close to the chest. I just dont understand what is taking so long.  
---
I had so many I dropped a bunch of them. Get th find more chems perk and stock up.
---
If it droped as plans all my plans say read and I don't have them I went through them 
---
"I GOT BANNED AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING WRONG! my 4 year old brother downloaded a bot and pressed the 'start bot' button and i stopped it immediately and woke up the next day with a BAN!" translates to "i was botting like my dick was gonna fall off if i didn't"
---
Not just to vendors man, people will take drugs from you all the time, junkie mains are quite a good catch 
---
It's Reddit.  It's all of Reddit.  It's every sub.
---
Anger is a hell of a drug, and online forums provide a fantastic place to semi-anonymously feed your rage.
---
It feels good to be angry, especially at something that can't fight back, and even better against something you know won't change quickly in response.
---
Today I killed four 3-stars and three 2-stars at WS as well as a number of diseased/ambiguous “legendary” enemies. Afterwards I went through my loot and EVERY SINGLE legendary item I picked up was a 1-star. Every single one.
---
How do you know they were dupers? It’s not possible to get two shot with slap damage. This has been proven. Did you have any workshops? People can start to claim your workshop and then have a friend in their team kill you because their whole team is now flagged for PvP against you. Pacifist doesn’t prevent PvP when PvP events (such as workshops) are involved. I recommend avoiding workshops if you’re going to do something that involves valuable junk. It’s a pretty bullshit exploit. 
---
That’s really cool of you, I’m on PC sadly.
---
Yeah I received my email awhile back just playing thr wating game :)
---
Hell these are just accounting, tertiary systems, they don't even involve the gameplay engine.  As saves are checked out, and periodically updated, every time it should be check pointed and inspected what changed.
---
It's nothing short of utter incompetence, even if they had no idea at all, this kind of thing would be easy to add 'after the fact' as all the saves are literally stored and updated on their servers.
---
How much for chest?
---
Yeah, I am going on 48 hrs now and still no refills.  They really did nerf the crap out of this too!
---
Red:
---
You're gonna fit right in. Everyone in here is innocent. Heywood, what're you in here for?
---
Heywood:
---
Didn't do it. Lawyer f***ed me.
---
....except it doesn’t by the listed items. It has been said a million times before and it seems it’ll take another million to get the message out...
---
Having 10 or 100,000 nuka colas or ultracite scrap makes absolutely no difference on server stability. 
---
Try this, make a new character. Name it 10. Play for a bit, see how it feels.
---
Now make another and name it 1000000. Is the game laggier? are the servers failing? 
---
This is literally the same thing. An item has a number value assigned. A character has a name string. It is literally 0 difference.
---
Funny, I have been watching the LFG posts to check for duping since the hunting rifles went legendary and haven't seen hide nor hair of these 'dupe services' posts nor have I seen any proof of duped hunting rifles.
---
I call bullshit.
---
Neat!
---
Wait you can own shops?? Will people actually buy stuff from you?
---
I would like to know this as well, and if anyone on the PS4 can show me. Do message me.
---
I hear you there. I was fortunate enough to get a jet pack a month ago. Maybe persistent is a better word as I spent close to twenty hours server hopping to find it. For me the last thing I wanted was platinum trophy. Got it. Now it’s up to Bethesda to see if they can lure me back with content. 
---
Ammo cannot currently be sold to vendors. Nor can duplicate plans/recipes. I tend to stick my dupes in other inside containers (if there are any) or the suitcases outside the stations (along the tracks, so folks like me who walk the rails find 'em).
---
Haha awesome, good man!
---
&gt;I wish there was a 3rd-person video capture feature
---
Agreed. I've wished we could record demos of gameplay since FO3. That, along with the ability to switch the player whose perspective you're watching during playback would be great for this.
---
I'm more the lines of thinking this new so called Austin studio thing is 100% fresh college grads who got into IT because 'pay' but have absolutely zero interest in such, and really couldn't tell you anything about MMO's at all.
---
I'm pretty sure it's 100% staffed with people that operate on the 'everyone is wrong, I'm correct' mindset.  Not that would be all that surprising in Austin.  I'd only expect more incompetence from San Francisco.
---
I dunno man. This sub seems worse than others. Not the worst for sure but the people here can be so dramatic and excitable. 
---
I walking back from Scorched Earth. They began attacking my teammate. As I approached, they immediately started shooting me. I did not engage— one of the shots took half my HP bar now. They were using explosive weapons and super sledges.
---
I always run Pacifist for nuke events... I was shocked how they were doing so much damage. I eventually killed them a few times and just got sick of the BS and logged out.
---
How they accomplished this, I have no idea. Something seemed fishy...
---
I'm really not interested in how more character slots effects dupers. That is a horrible way to plan QoL features. 
---
I just want more slots, and I'm willing to pay for them. Period.
---
I'm not looking for work arounds and I'm not interested in buying more game copies to get them.
---
I don't know why that's so hard to understand.
---
Valid question, but haven't tried that. I dont store them ever into stash as they take so much room, as well as using them to craft doesnt' require a lot of other resources. That plus it's rather hard to run out of glass, and the bottles on the other hand are everywhere.
---
The question would apply to more for something that can will stored, like the one you get from nuke zone, which is required to purify flux. It's name is so similiar to many other things I don't dare to quess it, but the one that's junk and gives ultracite. So it's valid question in their case but haven't checked.
---
Wouldn’t mind some opera music either 
---
Instigating, VATS crit and VATS fills faster.
---
LOL i put a power armor helmet in there once. Last experiment I ever ran over at the Dolce factory. 
---
Yes, I have bought a lot of decent legendaries at Watoga.  I always check it out when in the area, people farming the SBQ sell some decent stuff or drop it there.
---
Pacifist doesn’t prevent people from hurting you. It prevents you from hurting people. If your friend wasn’t in pacifist then he could have flagged both if you for PvP if you were in a realm it doesn’t seem fishy. It seems like you’re not familiar with how PvP works in general. 
---
Well thanks for playing and enjoying the game for the time you did. I hope soon it will respark your interest and you'll enjoy it once again. :)
---
It is an interesting thought though selling stuff to other players. It would be nice if they hurry and add player vending. It would make things much easier. I still probably wouldn't sell most of my chems though. Also if I encounter another player I just give them things for free. I guess that's my own problem. 
---
That’s not too bad 
---
I’ve finally gotten rid of lockpick perks and leveled up my semi auto damage and using the handmade is the best 
---
Really hate that they upped the price of plans because I painfully chose to buy the plans for 1500 caps
---
Wait, you can craft those? Was the plan a random drop or was it from a quest? I’ve been swinging by the cemetery every night when I’m making my cap earning tour, they’re usually ignored in favor of the guns
---
This needs to be pinned to the front page 
---
moderation?
---
lol you are talking about Bethesda, they have no method of inspecting all of the player states to know what is going on in world.
---
Praise Atom. Thank the gods I checked reddit tonight.  I was, this close, to discarding the 499,999 Single Action Ivory Pistol grip plans in my cherished collection for fear of being misidentified as a duper. 
---
 You are wrong.
---
If you are on a new character that hasn't done bos quest line it will not let you turn them in.
---
I've had this happen multiple times. Didn't want to wake up correctly. I've had to hard reset the system once to get out.
---
Man just take this game with a game with a grain of salt 25% of the time i fight the queen it just disappears honestly if you dont like it just wait a week or three 
---
I've seen that one for sale inside Top of the World (mezzanine level). It was priced fairly high, as far as I can remember.
---
I wear power armor almost exclusively. My under armor is purely aesthetic, I wear full heavy bos combat armor +bos fatigues, grey mining helm and gas mask. My under armor happens to be 4/5 unyielding with 1 vanguard's so I could PvP if I wanted to. Have never really wanted to though so I'm not sure why I haven't sold my armor 
---
I did not accidentally fire on them with pacifist mode disabled, which would have initiated PvP. Secondly, I understand I can take slap damage— this was not slap, it was KO damage. So if my teammate decides to engage others, Im somehow now involved despite me not firing? This goes against everything Ive read regarding PvP.
---
I have enough experience designing databases with millions of records to understand it doesn't matter how many of a given item are *stored.* That said, I know nothing about how duping is done or what operations it triggers server-side. The servers weren't intended to handle this kind of behavior, and yeah it'd be nice if they handled it more gracefully, but if you've ever programmed anything, you know any project, much less one as complex as this entire game, can get out of control fast when it faces the real world.
---
I had like, 30 Buffout in my inventory and I did my vendor round-a-bout at Whitesprings when I found out I could sell them for 8 caps a piece, 200 Caps in my pocket that day.
---
No Ive done all that 
---
1000 caps
---
Two shot needs to have the accuracy penalty dropped if it stays at 25% damage (should of just pushed this out with the patch, but oh well), plumber was massively overperforming (yes I main a pipe rifle) and white knight was generally overperforming.
---
Yes I still run white knight.  Yes it is still largely mandatory.  Why?  Scorchbeast attacks are massive AOE that deal shockingly high damage to armor.  The damn crop dusting cancer ass juice one especially.  
---
Seems like a good post.  Steps in the right direction are occuring, just the constant little blunders by the devs and the cacophony of bitching that follow make it hard to notice lol.
---
I found the brotherhood fatigues once and they look REALLY nice I almost regret trading it 
---
Anyone find the X01 mod plans?
---
"some" builds
---
The game is beyond repair. Hopefully the studio learns from its mistakes. 
---
Hahaha what you dont think they have reason to deceive and save face? Its funny how they put out a statement and everyone just believes
---
Ha
---
Have you used Gatling Laser and/ or Gatling Plasma though? I'm not dismissing the possibility that shotguns might break fast. 
---
But I have used shot guns and I have used Gatling plasma and I have no doubt that- at least for me- the Gatling plasma breaks way faster. 
---
Oh fuck, did this thread merge with r/The_Donald?
---
Mine are the ones Knight Rhys wears in fallout 4, I have the other version sitting in my stash. I guess I'm wearing brotherhood knight fatigues or something like that?
---
If you're around, I'm at home and about to log on. What's your ID?
---
Large number of players on a server is not instantly a good thing 
---
 Completion for resources and exp becomes a problem 
---
As long as you keep the weapon you can eventually craft it into a level 45 version.
---
Yeah im starting to agree. Everytime a patch comes out its making it worse and worse while gaining server stability
---
Alright :) I’m ready to give you up to 5 rare outfits for this one :)
---
so i should just use shotgunner up to lvl 2 instead of lvl 3?
---
Oh, I have a friend who loves gatling lasers, so he carries four of them to get through a queen fight. Apparently the 50cal lasts a lot longer with a similar fire rate though.
---
I mean, I can maybe see that, but two things:
---
1) The announcement reveals something we've been assuming they have all along;  a time based log of inventory.  Maybe it's not super granular, but it's something that's obvious to their logging.  A newb who logs in, finds a bag, and picks up 75 bobbleheads isn't likely to show up as a duper in this system, but even if they did...
---
2) The type of newb who would find 5 million rounds of shotgun shells and think "this is probably legit" right now... it's going to be real newb, and probably somebody low level on a new account.  This would make it more obvious that something fishy probably happened to them, unless the dupers are buying new copies of the game over and over for their accounts (the money IS there for this, I guess), so I think they'd have a pretty good option to appeal, because...
---
3) Going back to the log, I'm betting that log logs trades.  So if Mr. Newb find a bag with 3 trillion cans of dog food inside, grabs a hundred, and hands them out to buddies, that's going to look REALLY different than a duper's mule in the system, but mainly...
---
4) I keep saying "a hundred" on these items because an actual innocent newb likely doesn't have the perks that let them hup 1,000 cans of dogfood, nor do they have the 100 lb power armor, or be in any position to actually use those items with the weight limit cap.  A real newb would likely find the holy grail, grab up too much stuff, find out they're totally over-encumbered, and drop most of it.  They would then use it, hand a couple to friends, or immediately deplete the first vendor they see.  It takes a while to find all the vendors unless you know what you're looking for, so they're not going to hike back and forth for more than 200 caps...
---
Which is a long winded and boring way to say, the behavior patterns of an actual newblet finding a cache of goodies looks way different than a duper trying to money launder their ill gotten gains.  Especially because, in iffy cases, I'd expect there to be some subterfuge and investigation going on, like setting up a buy.  If they set up a sting and Ms. Innocent Survivor bubbles about the free stuff and leads them to the bag... probably not a duper.
---
Or the world's best duper of all time.
---
Thank you for taking action against the players abusing your game!!
---
You've not seen Pee-Wee's big adventure? You uncultured swine.
---
So your stating the obvious, about how he was stating the obvious.
---
Ooookay.
---
Let me break it down:
---
You don't claim to be innocent until you get punished.  You don't get punished until some entity of authority decides to administer punishment.
---
People didn't claim to be innocently banned prior to this because they weren't being banned.  Make sense yet? 
---
One of the problems with duping is that people at least used to make hundreds of real dollars or whatever currency off of it.
---
Yep.  Noticed it too.
---
Made me switch from my silenced anti armour lever rifle ty medics vats enhanced non silenced handmade...because I only get one shot off in stealth anyway so need the extra clipsize
---
"This game has been out for 2.5 months and people act like it has been years. the game is still a baby. "
---
Oh yeah sorry, you are right my bad, how dare i expect a working game for my money that i paid. 
---
Obviously rather then paying 60 bucks upfront i should have given bethesda 10 bucks, then every patch they get another 5 bucks, and when they screw up like with this patch i take 3 bucks away from them until they deploy the hotfix. All totally reasonable, my wallet is just 2.5 Month old, still a baby and all.
---
In all seriousness, if you enjoy the game, that's fine, i'm happy for you, but you don't need to White Knight for Bethesda here when they screw up, they are a Million dollar company full of grown ups, they can handle themselves.
---
This looks like a Bethesda Game Studios level gig, not a Zenimax Nylon Bag Corporation gig.  The studio has been doing their best to make things work well, except for the latest release, which I'm sure had quite a few devs and managers absolutely pooping their pants in horror.
---
As somebody who worked on building an automatic updater and build system for a decently sized market of software, let me say that patch day took a year off my life, and everything went well.
---
Red hamburger patty on red ground = lol fuck this 
---
I found these actually that are different than the regular under armour

I haven't really played since. Got Resident Evil 2. Don't know how long that will keep me entertained but yeah my fun from cap stash farming is gone.

There's nowhere frigid enough in WV to find mine
---
Dead woman? Epic gamer moment.
---
Have you ever had two light switches that work one set of lights. It’s like that. 
---
That's kinda why I used Charleston but okay. I'd be good with the 1:1 in a vendor. Although it has some issues. Ultimately, it would make the economy tank because someone would exploit the cap refresh rate. If the factions all had separate pools of caps with a defined max total, I think that would help control things.
---
Heck, I'd totally support that as a first warning.  You log in, your inventory is gone except for that in the notes screen.
---
😆
---
whats your psn? id love to visit your shop..is it the signs and letters plan which costs 12000 caps that let you write your sign on the shopfront?
---
They also really specifically specified that what they're flagging is people with 500k to over a million of them. You'd have to be earning at minimum 16k a day for a month straight just to get on their radar AND never have turned any in so they're actually in your inventory to raise suspicion in the first place. 
---
Didn’t she do the Vault dwellings in the trailer/starting area? At least that’s what I heard when the game first came out
---
I thought r/Fallout got a hate boner from raging on Bethesda while this sub can't decide whether to unreasonably praise them or tell them to go fuck themselves 
---
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies.
---
I got hit with 2 at once in whitespring, to be followed by one at the pumpkin patch... All three with the constant sonic garbage... 
---
Yeah, I have those too but haven't worn them. I think they're a drop from forbidden knowledge 
---
username checks out 
---
What if they just legitimately bought those items from someone else though? 
---
Well sir, are you aware that her damage resist scales with the number of players in the event? You’re putting a lot of extra burden on the players that are of level to be doing scorched earth. 
---
I’d recommend you be at least 50, even better at 60-70. Show up with all the ammo you can gather, then go get some more because you will need it. I use a .50 cal when she’s on the ground and a rifle when she’s in the air. Wasting your ammo and durability whiffing shots while she’s in the air it’s a great use of your resources. Take a few well lined up shots when she’s airborne, then unload with all the might of the brotherhood when she’s on the ground.
---
Happy hunting
---
Ad Victoriam 
---
Finally got my 10. For that gave me 20 caps and 200 XP.
---
It does though. The strength bonus increases your carry-weight.
---
I think so yeah 
---
I wore the bomber jacket for awhile but I have silver shroud on right now 
---
why don't you ban yourself from making any more shit Fallout games? problem solved.
---
I could honestly care less if someone wants to buy in game items for cash. What they do with their money is their business. And i would have to say that the part of me that doesnt like people selling things for cash is the part of me that is jealous of these people. Thats just me tho
---
And now you're just saying what the guy you replied to originally was saying. Make sense yet?
---
I went back and visited every POI. 
---
Well you kinda do have to clean your guns with he weapon damage system. (I really like weapon damage.)
---
Seeing the community reacting to those bans in the way they did is embarrassing to day the least. It's like we have an itch to complain about anything that supports our opinions.
---
96 huh? I have 501 levels between 3 characters. Not a single TSE has dropped for me. :(
---
No BloodiedE, AAE or FuriousE either. No 2shot crit, Bloodied crit, Furious crit or AA crit for my vats guy either.
---
Basically this game has not given me anything that I want. But if anyone needs a stalkers melee weapon, I get about 10 a day, I will sell you one for 7 caps.
---
No they fucking buffed rad worms and reduced duration so now when you are sick with rad worms you get stronger mutations and when it wears off it makes your mutations weaker until you log off. 
---
You have a good point. If it doesn’t negatively effect you, you probably shouldn’t complain.
---
Bloodied gatling gun, fully modded. 9 points in heavy gunner, 3 points in martial artist, 3 points in blocker. Glow sights 3. Lone wanderer 3, tenderizer 3. Stabilized 3, nerd rage 3. Dodgy, serendipity, bloody mess, adrenaline etc. And pop a psychobuff when killing the queen. Do not use VATS, it's worthless. Learn how to aim with a gat.
---
Takes about 150 bullets = ~1.5 minutes to kill the queen when shes flying. She's dead in 20 seconds if she lands. Make sure adrenaline is always fully buffed.
---
All other enemies except scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens die from 1 bullet.
---
The stabilized perk gives the gatling gun pinpoint accuracy, needs some practice though as it does not have ironsights. It's the coolest sniper IMO :)
---
If you only did 1:1 with the current vendor system I don’t see how it could be easily exploited without selling to players and that won’t happen as you’re going to be spending more at the vendor than you’ll get back from another player.  It would just make high prices items a little more accessible, but still difficult to acquire. 
---
Even if you did just the 1:1 change, you’ll still only be able to farm 1400 caps per day from the vendors but could farm bulk steel/springs/etc without a significant caps loss.  Buying from players would still be cheaper, but it’s more cumbersome without a centralized market for players to buy/sell. 
---
They mentioned people with as little as 15k were effected, and I didnt see that the items needed to be on you, just obtained within the time frame of the past 30 days. Not saying you're wrong, just that I'm not seeing those qualifiers.
---
At least we can clear out the adds on the ground.
---
I don't know for sure but I wouldn't at all be surprised considering how closely she's been working with Bethesda lately and how close those areas were to her aesthetic. 
---
Yeah I personally grind the games i play because i enjoy it. But if i didnt have time because of work or family i would totally understand why people would want to spend some cash to keep up
---
Mine’s here. Coincidentally it’s about 15 degrees and snowy in WV right now. 
---
I'm a month late but thank you so much for this. Almost lost SO much junk but this actually worked. Awesome!
---
Pop 10 Rad-X and you only take 1 rad in a Blast Zone.
---
&gt; did you learn you could you get the excavator power armor plans and power armor crafting station for free in the quests long before this point?
---
Im aware of it yeah, I once got close to the site where it's done. But that was like close to 2 month ago lol. Haven't done it yet. Really should, really will, but I think I'll try hooking up with Enclaive first, they have better benefits and more new stuff. Plus 200 more caps per day.
---
The game does give that quest to you fairly early, and the connection between quest and the PA is very strong. Once you have the quest you know you get the PA from it. The only thing you'd need to learn from other players is what's the point, whats the advantage of that model, and because it's good for what is is, you don't need to read much to see it being mentioned over and over. Anyone playing a lot won't miss any information about that.
---
But unlike this BOS thing. Whatever the benefits are, no one really talks about them, so Im quessing Bos is not so huge thing. And ultracite armor best to my knownleadge, it's not commonly used. I can craft some pieces, but never considered, since Im assuming it's significantly more expensive to repair, than the basic and common T-60. Also I'm mainly using PA on nuke zone and only because of the radiation. I originally choose my specials with the idea of having as high resistance as possible, without PA. But then reality hit and I've used much more of those specials into weight perks. Recently I checked, with perks I have 270, without them I would be about 1500 lol, and that's still with some weight reduction armor pieces I didn't bother to strip off.
---
I did yesterday buy the jetpack mod from vendor for T-60 since they all got opened and I was max caps anyway, so might try that and see if it opens "new angles" to the game together with my marsupine.
---
Generally speaking I think if you can name or even think anything you wonder about the game, you can just google it. Although not all small tiny things aren't yet listed on anywhere easily found, all major info has been for ages now. 
---
Known plans are still buggy.  Bought water purifier small because it said it wasn’t known at Grafton Vendor.  197 caps later, as soon as I try to learn it it says known.  
---
Cool story bro.
---
They actually do protect you, my friend did it back just after the B.E.T.A
---
I am currently unable to build any electrical equipment in my camp (let me clarify - I CAN, but I shouldnt), because every time I do, my tamed Scorched Deathclaw attacks my generators and powered lights, spamming aoe attacks until they are removed.
---
Lol, mines here too - and I'm only a few hours from you in NE Tenn.  Getting a little warmer here thankfully.  55°
---
Yeah. This. Never seen her drop mods, only plans for mods. 
---
Similar thing happened to me this afternoon, but it was just me. Three other people loaded in while i was battling them and immediately noped out. Can't really blame them but they caused a ton of diseased gouls to spawn and I got to slay those fools too. Best part is, I managed to do it all without getting rad worms. I did have a legendary disappear when I tried to loot it though.
---
all except melee
---
So, a legitimate complaint is crying? 
---
Haha fair enough.
---
So a legitimate complaint is rage?
---
I think some people might just be looking for things to say about the game. I mean selling them for real money is of questionable legality, but I don’t partake in it so I don’t complain. The only bugs I’ve ran into were minor and have been fixed. And I’ve never encountered a gridded though my friend met one. It doesn’t seem as bad as people make it out to be. I like the game and if other people can respect that I’ll respect what they think.
---
Just sad. I’ve been a life long fan of the series and had a similar experience with my nephew,I was showing him how to play, the game world, and different mechanics. 
---
I was showing him you could trade looted items to a vendor, when a player that’d obviously exploited the game to get near infinite damage one stop kills me while in the trading menu even though I didn’t engage in pvp.
---
My nephew then asks why don’t I go around killing other players in a similar fashion. I explain how the pvp slap damage rules of engagement work as well as fact that the player was exploiting. He responds “well that’s just stupid.” I then go on to tell him about the quests. He gets excited momentarily and inquires more about the quests. I explain that everyone is dead from nuclear bombs and you have to listen to recordings and follow the instructions. He then responds “what’s the point if everyone is dead.” Shortly thereafter he leaves game room and plays with his IPad downstairs. 
---
Just sad from someone so passionate about the series trying to pass the mantel to the next generation of gamers. Seriously WTF Bethesda.
---
I usually don't wear cosmetics because of the gear I've got. I'm usually in my BoS t60 though haha
---
Hey now there’s a reasonable low key request that could solve this particular problem.  If they made it about as big as those dung piles it would be a snap to find.
---
Oh shyt, Wait, wait.  Sigh.  If it were that big it could cover a legendary ghoul meat pile preventing you from looting that.
---
Dang, thought we had it.
---
I'm pretty sure if you enter a power armour that doesnt have a helmet equipped your head gear will be  visible
---
Story of my life and I like to keep around 100 lbs free but PA cuts it down to like 30-40
---
So you act ignorant and need to have things spelled out in small words and then you try to act smug...?  So your either a complete idiot or a troll.  Hope you have a good and excessively smarmy reply all worked up for this... will make ignoring it all the better.
---
Each item has a unique Id so if that legadary all of a sudden turns from 1 to 60 it might flag that account 
---
New bug introduced in their attempt to fix the previous bug they introduced when trying to fix the auto-scrapping of mods bug. 
---
It’s also been rehashed here ad nauseum. 
---
I haven't seen it mentioned elsewhere, but there is a couple of issues with the skin of the Short pump action shotgun. For the standard receiver, the 1st person and 3rd person the fore grip is Wood, yet in the modify screen, and when inspecting the weapon the fore grip is a grey polymer grip. now the issue is that with other receivers, like hardened for example, the texture is broken. its a polymer grip, but it looks like the game is trying to use the wrong texture for the modify/inspect model. it looks fine in 1st and 3rd person. in the bench modify screen, no recievers are shown to use the wooden fore grip.

What's kinda sad is that this _was_ kind of necessary. There was a thread in one of the gaming related subreddits earlier about those bans and everyone was putting it on Bethesda for "false banning" them. Bethesdas in such a bad place with the community that everyone's willing to jump to the conclusion that "Bethesda fucked up again" instead of treating it like any other situation.
---
Oh no.  None of that.  Simultaneous with permanent ban.  Or one last final login.  Everything is gone.  “We Know” pops up. Then screen goes black.  Forever. 
---
Seems like a classy lady.
---
You further prove my theory that no one on this sub is a positive person
---
The extra carry weight is a special perk of the excavator set and doesn’t apply to any other set.  If you want increased carry weight with others you’ll have to have calibrated shocks. 
---
Calibrated shocks are also available for the excavator armor allowing it to buff your weight by up to 200. 
---
 not sure but i noticed if i wasnt wearing all excavatot pa i lose my extra 100 carry weight..also dunno whats goin on but my carry weight has been all over the place since latest update..normall im around 440 carry weight..but i   noticed lately iv gone up to 600 carry weight..and marsupial has taken 6 off my intelligence instead of 4..are these related?
---
They, uh, didn't say they were depending 100% on user reports.
---
They were saying that they take user reports seriously, and apparenly use a user report to triage a human check.
---
And it does look like they're not doing auto-banhammers but actually have a moderation process that requires investigation.
---
this GAMER IS ON THE RISE, RISE UP BRUTHER.
---
Unfortunately, most people don’t think this far. They see big numbers and assume a bigger number causes constant server strain, regardless of where or what it’s for. As for the duping process itself, it seems more like a grey zone. I see people complaining about server disconnects daily, so there’s no doubt there’s something going on, however at 500 hours on the game with less than a total of 10 server disconnects, and fewer crashes still, I find it hard to believe I’ve never been in the same game as an active duper. That, aswell as the dupe methods have required a second player remain in the game, it seems duping is an *unlikely* cause for the majority of disconnections. 
---
Needs to be a toggled option in settings. The head is not always the weak point, fighting robots, ghouls and deathclaws, etc I have different targets 
---
Yep, there is a pretty serious pattern of manufactured allegations directed at Bethesda, with the simple tactic of having a bunch of accounts report similar issues pretending not to have heard about them before.
---
If you haven't experienced a specific bug, don't jump on the bandwagon with your flaming pitchforks or spread rumors.
---
That’s what I was hoping, ive got my T-60 fully modded minus the arms, so I was gonna bring them to ultracite to increase my resistance. Thanks!
---
That is exactly how i feel about it too. I like it a lot. I have really enjoyed playing it. It just seems like a lot of the things they have been doing is taking steps backwards. Today i didnt work and i played for a couple hrs and got off. This is highly unusual for me. I cant put my finger on what exactly is going on but my desire to play has been dwindling to be honest 
---
At various times, I've gotten Heavy Armor Arms, Legs, and Torso show up at Watoga (as well as the Sturdy versions). Never all three at once, and Arms and Legs much more often than Torso.  
---
Oddly enough, I found the Torso with my level 23 character, and the Arms and Legs with my 101.
---
A whole paragraph dedicated to explaining one of their sources is reports from players trading with people holding so many items. It's hard to report someone for having a million of an item if they're not holding a million of the item.
---
Also they're speaking fucking in general. Just because they mentioned Halloween candy alongside nuka cokas doesn't mean they're using the same standards for both. Of course it's easier to get your hands on thousands of candy than it is cola. 
---
Post of the year goes to you my guy!
---
I said duper duper.
---
Shhh!  Bethesda will hear you. 
---
No, they don't, that's the problem.   
---
Bethesda more or less confirmed that in the past.  Items generated do have an ID, but a duplicated item also gets it own unique ID and doesn't share the same one with the original item.
---
So unless they magically added a way to add a unique ID Ontop of the base ID the engine assigns to every single item upon creation, that is not how they are tracking it.  
---
And if they did something along that line, the extra load on the databases that are struggling to keep up with normal, non-mule characters, it would show.
---
lol...you have to laugh..otherwise you just get pissed off
---
Let's not release more content that will in all reality break on release and not give exploiters the chance to ruin new items please. I wish for more content as much as you but I want this game to run right first.
---
I agree I would hope and I do in fact think they have the means to tell the newb from a person with a guilty pattern of behavior.  MMO stings/undercover characters would be funny as hell.
---
unequivocally is an adverb that means "in a way that leaves no doubt"
---
no clarification needed, my dude
---
It's one of the rarest outfits in the game. The Leather Coat, Traveling Leather Coat and Tattered Field Jacket can only be acquired as rewards from daily quests and events in the Mire (as well as One of Us, but that can obviously only be completed once). The chance of receiving one as a reward is insanely low, something like 0.05% iirc.
---
Nope
---
random event called civil war re-enactor. will give a random civil war plan.
---
I see your point, but it's a snowball effect. You'd be adding 1400 a day plus the rewards, stashes, loot drops and whatever player based income nets you. Don't get me wrong, my idea isnt perfect and foolproof by any means. I just think that a randomized number of caps would make the game a bit less min/max focused and add a touch of realism. I'm a sucker for the little realism touches.
---
I have, many times, but I don't have it memorized lol.

That's...dumb

[Bethesda the Mod Author community has been trying to provide fixes to you since the BETA. You are still ignoring us and not using them..(https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljowa/bethesda_the_mod_author_community_has_been_try_to/]
---
It's everywhere, the question is, is it upvoted enough to make an impact.

It's so hot right now to hate on 76, so you can get your rage boner AND virtue signal about how bad the game obviously is AND get sweet, sweet karma.

This needs to be a toggled option in the settings of the game. It is a big change to the controls if you used VATS a lot before the change.
---
Everyone get your warm and fuzzy feelings out now, because you all know fucking well that the next time there's the smallest screw up everyone is going to be right back to crying that Bethesda never communicates with the community and how their rep account is just a shill tossing out canned responses about how they're sending their notes to the dev team.

just drop it and pick it back up
---
Hey, Bethesda, you want to get some cred?
---
Make a Youtube Series spoofing COPS where you track down and ban hackers.
---
I would watch the hell out of this.
---
Yeah that's relying on humans.

They should have a report in hand of who has what, who suddenly went from 0 of something to 100,000+++ of something.
---
This is simple accounting.

Charging real money for boosts/non cosmetics is the one thing they could do that would make me quit the game.

That's just it they have added new ways of finding dupers a while ago they couldn't track people's inventories now they can we just don't know how they do it that's the secret if we knewvwe could cheat the system

Well judging by the Bethesda respose and the other 90ish comments your the exception not the rule. This has now been reported across all platforms and many people.

It could be so many factors that just because its not effecting a select few doesn't mean there's not a problem.
---
Sorry just the few people that say "not me" makes no sense to me. It's not contributing to building awareness of the problem or trying to help figure out the why. 
---
It's nice that you went and tested it. But the question you should be asking is what is different about you that makes you the odd man out. Instead of, trying to disprove the problem everyone else is having.
---
With my level 98 character, my explosive double barrel was the only worthwhile legendary I had found, and now I need to have 17 perk points (9 for shotguns, 5 for demo, 3 for bloody mess) invested just to have it do 270 damage per shot. I feel a little shafted.
---
I'm going to have to disagree with you. For the first time, I'm able to launch a nuke AND kill the queen without being disco'd. The last 3 times I've fought the SBQ, she's been killed in less than 10 minutes. Once of those 3, she landed once and it was over. I know I can deal solid damage, but there are some builds that are doing considerable damage to her as well. I don't know what they are, but I have seen it, and they don't include TSE's.
---
If you're upset about the number of nuke launches, do it yourself! In the short amount of time I get to play each night, I launch one almost daily. There are a couple of nights I will just farm key cards. Also, the easiest SBQ battle I ever had consisted of 2 people and one of them was myself. It really isn't all that hard unless your unprepared.
---
I'm not a 'super' player, but I'm tuned up pretty well. I've had my fair share of disco's and other crappy things happen, but you've got to push through it. Don't allow the game to dictate you, make it yours! 
---
Hard no
---
They said they were looking into boosting energy and heavy weapons. Who knows if they will or when it would happen though
---
I can see that working, but there'd have to be a limit to how many to place at a time. There were decoration mods for FO4 like this, clutter decoration mods and if you used too much, performance would take a hit.
---
I'd just be happy with some new music TBH.
---
The queen doesn't drop mods, and mods aren't dropped when you die.
---
Wtf is this post even
---
Except... I've had it happen with legendaries at least 40 times and I haven't logged in since December 5th.

What goes trough my head when i hear the flapping sound of those wings:

---
would that be like going pay to win?..hope they dont  go down that path..i get that carry weight would be an issue without PA..but with power armor and a couple of wr perks..i dont seen to have trouble with carry capacity..i have hundreds of chems/aid and about 3 melee weapons 4 shotguns 2 handmade a laser pistol a tesla rifle tons of ammo..which brings my weight up to about 380..my max carry is 450..550 after i server hop..which leaves plenty of room to pick up junk or legendary stuff.
---
sometimes my carry capacity goes up to over 600..dont know why.
---
This seems to be normal problem and we think its a way to keep the servers stable.   
---
Call it DUPS

Bad toons, bad toons.

---
Having staff that read and respond to help tickets or suggestions costs money.  It is not in Zenimax's interest in supporting the player base by providing such services.  Starting in Elder Scrolls Online I noticed a trend for Zenimax to Cheap out on the customer support, I.e. cutting off phone support shortly after launch then NEVER having Game Masters available to assist players in a timely fashion..  Service costs money and we are not worth it to them.
---
&gt; Right now it literally is more entertaining to complain than to play the game.
---
Ahah true. I spend more time on this sub than I actually play the game.
---
Super duper story there, bro.
---
I don't get it did this dude not see Bethesda responded to banning https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I am in fact using both of those, not blood sucker though. Class freak healing factor and first aid 
---
^^^Found the undercover Beth Marketing Exec!!!!
---
cool..yeh its a very expensive plan for sure
---
Yeah that would be P2W if you utilized the extra weight to carry more weapons and ammo than your opponent could. I’m just sick to death about worrying about becoming overencumbered. And I know those lunchboxes that were datamined  supposedly have buffs like carry weight increase 
---
"You've been banned for: 14,229,781 days.
---
One day for each item you duped."
---
[Sometimes they're not.](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ypwqf/i_was_banned_from_blizzards_forums_after_my/ea9hp0m/?context=10000) Be skeptical of both sides.
---
Well, seeing how popular the ammo crafting mods for FO4 were, and how a lot of people loved the ammo crafting of Vegas, It would seem like a lot more people love ammo crafting than you think.
---
But The only thing They had to do to 'nerf' TSE, was to stop bobbleheads from stacking. thats all they had to do.

Mod authors came up with a way to check save files 3 years ago.    
---
Bethesda officially claimed they had no way to check players individual saves, and no tools to check or edit characters in '76. We (ModAuthors) politely reminded them we made one several years ago.  
---
Magically they can now check characters data..   
---
So Yes I'm aware of this, but the problem is they can't easily flag item duplication in small, desperate groups of items.   
---
They can and are watching for duplications of large groups of items (As the modding community, and others, suggested they do), and maybe (although they previously claimed they could not) run queries on the databases looking for people with excesses amounts of X or Y, but that still doesn't address the duping of 10 individual items once, then picking it up with a different character and trading and selling all 10 items.
---
Hmmm. I didnt see that in the patch notes.
---
Meat pule client side once you loot it it fades so you can get to the pile under
---
So **those were crocodile tears**. Good to know. Keep up the good work!
---
y'all being serious right now? lmaooooo 
---
If you bought 500k colas, it's pretty obvious they were duped, so that you would get the ban-hammer, most likely.
---
Oh, so exploiter laundering "I DUNNA DO NUFFIN, IM JUST HOLDING ON TO THE STOLEN GOOFS OFFICER"
---
My friend who i know hasnt done anything wrong has been locked out of his account for a couple of days now becuase he crafted 10 times for ammo.  Your going to ruin your own game because you don't know how to manage it.
---
This is an unintended bug that was nerfed, resurfaced in the January 29th patch, and didn’t get hotfixed.
---
&gt;Prepatch
---
Yeah that’s right, I am haha! And guess what you’re getting lunchboxes wether you like it or not! Yeah you’ll be paying us 2.99 a week for buffs and it will end up equaling the amount of a 12.99 monthly subscription fee!
---
Also you know what else were putting into the game? ads, yes were going to have those rusted out billboards you see everywhere display ads for McDonald’s and and Jiffy-Lube. 
---
You caught me
---
GT same as username?
---
This was a bug back before the first patch buddy, There was a bug and they fixed it by making the fire rate of almost every Full Auto weapon below half of what it originally was over 2 months ago.
---
Melee also has an absurd amount of damage boosting items that only effect melee damage. There are a bunch of cooked food items that boost melee damage (10% boost), then you have melee boosting drugs like fury (25% boost), then you have the twisted limbs mutation (another 25% boost). Im also not sure if effects that increase melee damage apply to unarmed combat, but if they do, then you can also throw in the talons mutation. 
---
Or just tells us the player's name even. "Oooh awesome camp.. I want to tell the owner it's cool. *Waits* hmm *camp disappears* damn

---
I for one enjoy knee capping super mutants when they turn to retreat and then proceed to pistol whip and punch them with a new friend; it's a team building exercise.
---
One super mutant had the audacity to tell my very British friend that he hits like a radroach (not even a like a molerat) after we had just knee capped him as he fled.
---
But yeah, I know them feels man but embrace the pain.
---
Overcome and adapt. You left the vault and were living hand-to-mouth. Now you have clean water, have enough ammunition to get through a scavenging run.
---
This game is a MMORPG that is a "fallout-like" simulator; ever hear of WoW's good ol' leeroy jenkins? IF you try to solo a bee's nest of level 69 Mutant Warlords and bullet sponges, your gonna have a bad time.
---
Also, people are leaving and liquidating ammo, weapons, etc for an insanely low amount of caps now. Yes, the worthless bottle cap. 
---
Some of the same legit traders who told me my bottle caps are worthless are now leaving with such salty hatred they now accept caps to justify throwing away any and everything; so don't be an empath and not barter/trade with other REAL players.
---
Right now is a time to capitalize on their meltdown. 
---
My perspective; try looking at it through that lens before wholeheartedly disagreeing. 
---
I haven’t forgiven them for shit, that post was a weak ass excuse and a developer cop out. They hold no accountability for the immense failure they are turning this game into. Despite the Shit reviews at launch THIS IS A GOOD GAME,or was, until Bethesda kept fucking it up.
---
well Beth just stated in recently that normal crafting is ok and will not trigger any bans, but I still worry about the Dev room items.
---
I know I do not have any illegal items but I get paranoid when I see stuff just laying out in the wild like that. Especially plans as I have no idea what is legal and what is contraband.
---
They just did the KNOWN tag, I wish the had a way to put a little Skull next to all Contraband items so we can immediately see the poisoned apples.
---
*You just discovered shitville.*
---
neon lettering plans ,wish granted.
---
This is my first time on reddit I do not know how to share pictures. I play on Xbox1 and have used the photo function on the game to take pictures of my camp bit I do not know how to share them here. Is there a link that someone could post with instructions?
---
This is a great idea!
---
Agreed with the naming of individual characters. 
---
And, a mechanism to better communicate with friends/other players.  The social tab is ridiculous. 
---
Holy shit I’m dying 
---
Yeah. I preferred having to manually scrap bulk to bulk being scrapped when scrapping all
---
I hole heartedly agree
---
I'm fully expecting to get downvoted to hell for this, but he may not be 100% wrong. BGS has screwed up just about everything there is to screw up with this game. Even their "fixes" make things worse half the time. I think to say that we should take them at their absolute word in banning 100.0% guilty people would be naive at best and not having a basic grasp of reality at worst.
---
I use an adapter for PS4 and wish there was an option to bring down the dead zone, its real jittery at times.
---
Last 2 times I was at a Queen kill, the amount of people needed to kill her lagged the server so much, no-one could loot her before she despawned. Its just a waste of time. And since TSE are crap and 3 stars of Anti-armor or other good weapons drop never theres no point in doing Whitesprings. Nukes are chores, and I dont care for it. sick of it.
---
Yes sir I’m in possession of contraband, good thing that the consequences of my actions won’t affect my life in anyway, if/when I get banned it was a good run and I have another  character that I pay legitimately on anyway.
---
&gt; For reference, it takes 20 bullets from a minigun that deals 14 damage to match 1 bullet from a gatling gun that deals 79 against an enemy with 100 armor.
---
For those given values, it's actually closer to 10.6:1 for any relevant amount of armor.
---
As someone that desperately wants a Tattered Field Jacket, I agree wholeheartedly. Especially considering the plethora of dead raiders sprinkled around the map that wear all 3 of these outfits. I have no problem with rare cosmetics, but they shouldn't be borderline impossible to get like these.
---
I mean " However, we want to reassure players that are playing the game as  intended – players who craft a lot, or collect a lot of junk, or saving  up to open a store – to have full confidence that we are not  deactivating accounts that belong to people playing the game normally. " I hate to say it, but "the majority" is 51%. You're not actually telling us anything that re-assures me in any real way, here. 
---
Ya, imagine how terrible it would be if there were factions fighting over resources.
---
Let's not pretend this was a design decision as much as it was a "we can't even let players put teddy bears on shelves for fear of the servers catching fire"
---
Friend of mine only lost most of his duped items. 
---
I havent had lost anything even after hoarding almost everything.  
---
try to re-log in couple times maybe thtat will help  
---
Well, I hope thats on another Ip or paid with another credit card because some youtubers have reported that they CLEAR THE BOARD.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFcLyDb6niA
---
With the stratospheric level of incompetence shown recently by bethesda, they should levy fines onto their managers and higher 
---
level developers and consider banning themselves from touching the FO76 code base.
---
Especially such a simple outfit. 
---
Well you’re obviously still interested cause you haven’t fucked off the sub yet 
---
Don't gamble on it man, wait till 46. I've only heard second hand about the 45 version or 50 version of items not being given till 46 or 51, so take it with a grain of salt. But just be on the safe side yeah?
---
Are you xbone?
---
... Sooo, I could get banned if I find a container with 5000 guns in it and I take just one? How could they track that sort of thing? And the people that paid actual money for duped items would therefore have a high likelihood of getting banned. What about the third or fourth person who touched the weapon.
---
(Where do I find the serial number on my TSE handmade to see if it is in the gubment database?) 
---
I would like to hear/see more voiceover holotapes telling more survivor stories and other lore bits.  I listen to every one I find and look forward to hearing more.  
---
A lot of great suggestions have been addressed.
---
What your doing differently? By my best guess is having your paycheck signed by Zenimax. ;)
---
Yes... Bethesda needs some help right now..
---
Oow that's a good one tho. u/thelonewanderer
---
that's a good suggestion.
---
I’m talking about moderating an AMA. 
---
What’s the problem?
---
I almost single handedly soloed the queen today, there was two other guys that did almost nothing lol
---
True but when does it become too much? Seems like kind of a grey area. I guess with the new carry-weight rules it won’t be so much of an issue though 
---
Also, some stashes haven't shown up at all since the update. I'm not sure if they were just removed or what.
---
Who'd you pick?
---
So you, one person out of thousands, haven't seen it so it is bs to you? Please pull head from bottom.
---
I'm having the same problem as Marvin12Mcm. I can't repair weapons/armor even when I have the requisite parts and perks.
---
4) Doesn't happen for all weapons, though it seems like it happens more with broken equipment. 
---
5) No Ticket#
---
heck no
---
The problem is that different advantages barely matter in this game.     The difficulty of an enemy here only depends on how much damage it takes to kill them, and how fast they kill you. Weapons that can reliably do the most damage, while using the least amount of resources, will always be the best option in 95% of your battles. 
---
2 months later and it's still in my listening rotation. Such a good song. 
---
Wait until the game fully loads around you before you do anything at all. 
---
How are we supposed to set up shops with the now kneecapped total storage?   
---
Most the vendors I knew completely abandoned the concept, and I've not logged in Since Tuesday's patch, because with 3 accounts with 4/5 characters over 5,000 pounds I'm not looking forward to days of "cutting weight"
---
I don’t know if this comment is going to be seen and it’s just a QOL request. I keep forgetting to ask with the topics come up.  
---
 the 5mm Gatling gun has a ring sight which isn’t usable because the gun is held at a tilt. 
---
Maybe the gun sight can be bent to reflect the aim of the bullets?
---
it would be good if they increased the carry weight a couple.hundred tho
---
Camelot Unchained is coming out in the next year or so, supposedly an updated version of DAOC
---
YA kind glad I didn't get my kids into this game, one has Asperger and I dont think he would have the patience to play a game with this many issues. he would have issue with all the little thing that make no sense....like adding a 3 lbs mod to a 20 lb gun makes its weight now 29 lbs. He would in WTF Crisis in no time.
---
He still likes to watch me play.
---
LOL back to Overwatch he goes, have fun little man.
---
I think it's diseases, or it might be both. 
---
My brain works wierd. I can almost always get within $10 of what I need for a project today. What usually trips me up is if I don't realize how low I am on glue, sand paper, or whichever sealant I will be using. I don't know why I can't seem to draw out what I want, but once I come up with a measurement, usually by mocking up with scrap even if on a smaller scale, I can at least start planning that way. 
---
Power armor sets your strength to 10 or 11, unless you have more. That's the mechanics. Excavator power armor was designed for mining. Stronger frame, better hydraulics, etc. Regular power armor is for carrying big guns, excavator is for carrying as much ore as possible. The same reason it has no Jet pack. It's low defense would protect from  falling rocks, but not bullets. I Ithink it's a great bit of flavor.
---
You need to remove the PA helm from the PA before getting in it. Or just put the hat on after taking the helm off. Ran around on my PA melee build in just a frame and mining helmet for the first 15 lvls.
---
Yes. 
---
Yes any statiom works unless the patches changed some stuff but as far a s I know if you can scrap it you can learn something
---
I want my X-01 fixed. Not sure if it’s a similar bug or what, but places Excavator and X-01 at the same time (trying to figure out which is which) and now my X-01 is painted like the Excavator. 
---
That is weird. I will have to do more testing I guess. As far as I know there is no way to destroy or damage floors, foundations and stairs. When you shoot them you see the spots they were shot but nothing goes through and they do not degrade. Eventually the marks go away. I have shot at the foundations and the floors and thrown grenades at them. It only did aesthetic damage to the outside that eventually went away. Nothing inside was damaged. All other structures in the camp system have a health/ damage bar, it does not show up on most of them until they take damage but then you can see it then. There is no health/ damage bar for foundations, upper floors or stairs. Also each time my previous bases were destroyed everything was destroyed except the foundations, upper floors and stairs. Those objects took no damage and did not require any resources to repair.  
---
The needs of the many , out way the needs of the few. It's ok if a few people who ' accidently ' picked up a dupers bag of loot get banned.  They should all have an opportunity to appeal the decision.  
---
People getting outraged over it because they are mad at Bethesda for unrelated reasons is the issue.  The fact those posts were getting voted to the top with literally no proof of their claims is an issue.  
---
E V E R Y B U I L D A K I N G
---
I know of two YouTube’s who got all accounts banned but were able to make others since they are on PS4, other non YouTubers just got the account used to exploit and the others on the same ip are fine.
---
What are you talking about? All these bans are based on exactly that type of information. 
---
That's why I don't think it's a big deal. People can already abuse this stuff through spelling out whatever they want lol. I mean if the 9k price on neon letters is supposed to be prohibitive they can always gate the camp naming option behind a quest you get around 30.
---
Bethesda banned the perk for duping.
---
 SP CO-OP 
---
oh, names? :)
---
Hence why I think it would be nice to have some kind of damage output meter.
---
well probably not because the way it works you don't pacify the pets , if its one you can (own) the pacify option will change to (tame)
---
Is it me or did this patch just nerf .308 sniper rifles?
---
The bit with the SBQ wasn’t because of TSEs being OP, it had to be a bobblehead exploiter to do that much damage in a single hit. 
---
Looks like she went to Virginia.
---
And it was stupid then. 
---
This dev didn't say their system was infallible. At least if they find out by whatever means that a person that got banned did not deserve that ban, they are willing to over turn the ban. 
---
http://i.imgur.com/mFin9Oz.jpg
---
Yes, causes that the issue? 
---
What fixes make things worse? Most of the time they’ve been nothing but improvements. This last patch was a mess but they’re fixing it. 
---
When they’ve made mistakes they’ve admitted it. Why would a company ban a paying customer? Like I said. Common sense. 
---
Also, you’re gonna take the word of people in this sub really? Did you not learn your lesson with all the other bullshit rumors spread around?
---
This is perfect. My character will never feel finished at this point because like you said, everything is a sponge now. I was on a server earlier and someone popped the SBQ we fought her for roughly 15 mins. There were about 8 people id say 60 % were over level 80 and could not kill her lol everyone gave up and left... its pitiful.
---
Hadn't heard of that, thanks for the info. 
---
What were you thinking, these players are lost with out their TSEs, ITS THE ONLY WAY THEY KNEW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. I see them, just flopping around on the ground like fish out of water, mumbling something about it being bullshit that the SQB didn't die in 10 seconds.
---
Yeah except that didn’t happen. 
---
Oh I just realized you were probably saying that as advice to me lol.
---
There are two problems though, the first is that the look doesn't suit some builds (i'm a rustic farm, neon colours don't exactly fit in) and the second is the budget cost. A decent name could cost 7-8% of your budget (each letter is .5% each). That's really painful when you're trying to make a place look spiffy. xD
---
Sure
---
I would be happy if the Jukebox played more than 3 tunes.
---
I have not strange in numbers equipped.
---
It always happens after rad worms and also other diseases, that whether speedster or marsupial effects are negated 
---
The problem for Bethesda was that THEY weren’t making money...
---
Hello Satan, I have heard a lot about you! LOL.

Then if I turned on my in game TV and saw then I would love it:

---
Aaaaaaaand Hotfix'd.
---
I never said you accidentally fired on them with pacifist disabled lol. Your teammate flagging for PvP will absolutely flag you too. That’s how it works right now. 
---
Wikked is literally this guy’s friend, and didn’t get banned, so their “proof” is suspect at best.
---
Was there a question here? 
---
the stats are all over the place for them , under my effects it says speeddemon gives me %40 speed instead of 20 and marcupial is giving me -6 intelligence instead of 4
---
I have a TS Gauss Rifle as my primary.
---
Secondaries are TS Lever Action and when they get real close Quad shortened Double Barrell.
---
Just aim and spray at the legs and they hobble around...
---
I’ve had a dozen ghouls hobbling behind me one time as I slowly strolled in Whitespring.
---
Was a sight to see 😂
---
If that were even slightly true the dupe farmers would have been shut down on day one.
---
Re-read the part about user reports.
---
These are human run systems.  They clearly have NO internal game state reports being run. 
---
It's fine for a human to decide a ban, but it's clear that they are relying on humans to report. 
---
With the last regression based update, it's pretty clear that the tool 'diff' is beyond them.
---
They really need to step up their game already! 
---
anyone else feeeling sad man ? :(
---
How about both at the same time. 
---
I'm never around my jukebox.  I'm at the point where I just want to get a mic so I can play "Tiptoe through the tulips" or "Having a wonderful time" during the SBQ fight for others to enjoy. XD
---
Perk cards and other effects do not seem to be applying consistently.  As an example, I was just playing and tried to pick a level 3 lock and it said that my lockpicking skill was one even though I had all three cards equipped.  I unequipped a card and it went to zero.  I tried unequipping and re-equpping the lockpicking cards multiple times but it was either zero or one.  I have another character whose lockpicking skill was showing up as four with three cards equipped.
---
I've also noticed that my melee character seems to attack faster and do more and more damage the longer I play.
---
Did you go into the zone with pacifist off? I've still never seen proof of bypassing slap damage. This leaves me to assume someone responded to your PVP slap after the event. I'm genuinely curious, because no one seems to be able to prove a slap bypass.
---
Thank the whining fucks that wanted TSE nerfed
---
You’re being purposefully thick on this. They very, very clearly said in the above post that they pulled the names out of the database of everybody that had 500,000+ of certain item types. That’s literally what they said, just go up and read it again. 
---
They’re just saying that they’re also taking reports seriously and personally inspecting the accounts and inventories of players below this automated line. This isn’t a technical issue, it’s a manpower issue. The lower you go the more likely you are to ban innocent people, so they manually inspect accounts below the threshold. Is this really that hard to understand?
---
I never did until rockstar flagged my GTAO account last year. Legit player since launch, transferred my account to PC from xbox 360. New update was coming out and I needed some cash, so I sold about 1.5m in cars in 3 minutes, and the next time I logged in I was told that my account balance had been set to 0 because they felt I had made it illegally. 
---
Filed a support ticket and got an automated response. Filed a more descriptive ticket and got the exact same automated response with a different 'name' on it. Called the support line and was told that they could in theory see how I made that money, but that they wouldn't even look at it because their program was never wrong. Thank God they did it when they did, because I was going to finally give in and buy shark cards when the update dropped. Instead I decided that fuck them and paid someone to give me money. $5 irl, and 1 billion in game later and I regret nothing. 
---
TLDR: mega rare but it happens, and fuck Rockstar with a cactus. 
---
Lol like they can do an actual conversation with people.
---
And I'm sure it'll all be softballs and puppy dogs not real questions like what experience do they really have, how are they not testing anything, how do they not even oversee diffs before a release???? 
---
Just get a Super Sledge and cheese it like everyone else.
---
No ammo, repairs cost nothing and it only weighs a couple of pounds. It's literally like setting the game on easy mode.
---
My Combat Knife did more damage to the SBQ than my TSE Gauss did pre-nerf. Wasn't, and definitely now isn't, useful against the queen.
---
And not everyone just relied on their TSE. I'm a primarily melee stealth build, having a powerful TSE just meant I could have a more balanced build...not having to spend as many points in Perception to up my ranged damage.
---
Right.. if you dont like tse dont use it. Simple solution. Dont ruin the game for the majority of people who enjoy shooting enemies instead of whacking them to death.
---
Lmao I’m not a rat, it’s not my place to expose others. I don’t get why reddit is limiting me to comment every 8 mins.
---
Not really logged in since Tuesday either, feel you.
---
TSE didnt need to be nerfed in the first place but because of the constant tears of impotent rage now enjoy bulletsponge 76 
---
I took a break from the game myself i have a melee alt but its boring
---
aka relying  on what was supposed to be an extremely powerful and rare weapon. Maybe they saw some wisdom and reducing the effectiveness in a weapon that was so powerful it let people get just by in only using 3 weapon  perk cards lol.
---
They’re finding outliers in the data. They’re not banning for tens of thousands of candy. So I think you’re safe. Carry on. 
---
South to the real VT... Virginia Tech.
---
I have a TSE handmade that I find plenty powerful enough. All the rifleman perks, tankkiller, a few others. I feel it's just about right. There's no more TSE available right? So you still have a powerful gun that shoots two exploding bullets, add armor penetration and bam.
---
My All Rise supersledge does more damage but is much slower. I'm really happy with my build.
---
Something else that needs to be said, but first a disclaimer: I understand that they latest patch caused problems, but it also solved a lot of them too, and I think put a lot of dupers out of business. 
---
I that is a big part of the reason behind the rage we are seeing after the latest patch. 
---
Consider the following.
---
A. The patch nerfed two- shot explosive weapons, which are the most duped weapons in the game. These weapons    were sold for real world currency on ebay. The nerfing potentially makes these weapons less sought after,  costing dupers money. 
---
B.  After the patch,  plans for T51 calibrated shocks, T60 jet pack, etc. were now available at the Watoga vendor for  anyone who had the caps.   As with TSE, these items were sold for real- world currency on ebay because they were basically impossible to obtain in game for most people, most of the time. 
---
Thanks to the patch, anyone willing to grind for caps and flux can have calibrated shocks and a jet pack for T60 and T51. They no longer have to buy them from a duper on ebay.
---
I'm sure the dupers were furious about this, and I firmly believe that much of the rage on reddit about the latest patch comes from them.   
---
Ranged needs a complete overhaul, generally speaking it needs a buff, some weapons more than others.     
---
And I agree, the TS(e) rebalance as flawed in many many ways
---
Woosh
---
They should have known this day one as it was happening. They should have been able to identify the farmers as they were farming 
---
I'm not buying any of this 'they know' for a second, as the last patch demonstrates just how incompetent they are.
---
Stop and look around.  Do they even slightly sound like they have a handle on anything? 
---
I had it off, but apparently if team mate engages in PvP you are flagged for PvP as well... 
---
Yes, and INT effects the learn rate, so buff beforehand if you can
---
Awesome! I’ll have to give that event a shot and see what I can land from it. Thanks!
---
I’ve been so screwed with weight and I don’t wanna fuck myself over with the ridiculous cap prices on plans now. I’ve just been logging on to sell to the two vendors in watoga then go offline for 20 hours. It sucks.
---
As soon as people claimed to be banned for just having items found in a paper bag, I knew they were full of it. This isn't the first time someone has just claimed random BS and this sub swallow it as scripture. 
---
Considering the Enclave mostly use energy weapons in cannon.
---
They’d have a hard time even taking on the Mole Rats our the back of the Cult of the Mothman Church...
---
Quick bro I need a weapon workbench, me red and green light pew pew is kaput 😂
---
biggest creature i have personally seen tamed is lvl 30 mirelurk but some guy claims he tames lvl 91 deathclaw but i have seen no proof of that
---
I would really like Bethesda to do these kinds of things officially. I'm playing on PS4
---
Really really just want them to fix their database system..  
---
And Pay to Win would suck so badly...
---
I’m on pc. Sometimes when I take disease cure my marsupial mutation stops working.
---
Yo my dude. Nobody is legitimately crafting 500k handmade guns. That’s just not possible. 
---
I didn’t know there were “treasure hunter bodies.” I’ll be keeping a better eye out for those from now on. Thanks!
---
Oh. I thought the pump had a quad to it. I guess My mind got confused since the shotgun TSE fires multiple shots that are explosive and I thought it was a quad TSE
---
They use to have a daily called queen of the hunt where you fight a cryptid and collect and analyze its DNA. Idk what happened to it i cant seem to trigger it anymore.
---
They accidentally removed the keyword that protects them from being auto-scrapped 
---
I might have to try that.
---
I'm just letting a couple hot fixes happen. But if what you call fun is one shotting enemies in PvP and PvE, then yea they took your fun away. 
---
i just uninstalled the game after I posted that.    You should just do the same.  Bethesda just makes us all look like dip shits for holding on this long. 
---
yeah, i was being silly lol
---
I don’t put much stock in AMAs after Blizzard. Questions tend to be cherry-picked, and nothing really comes of it. If there was something they didn’t want to say before, they aren’t going to suddenly say it in an AMA.
---
Most TSE could be duped.
---
Depending on what I can pull from your suggestion I may take you up on that offer. I’m on Xbox as well. 
---
I hear they do a pretty good Oxy and Mountain Dew business. 
---
Absolutely not and they would get absolutely trashed on YouTube if they did something like this. 
---
Ammo crafting would be fantastic, but we can't keep all the cool weapons we want to use the different types like we did in fo4.  That's where the flaw in their logic is.
---
They take off a lot and don't add anything. This make me sad but I think that in few weeks, there will be very few people playing this game. Some people will say that "The game is fun, you play the wrong way" but I'm pretty sure they will also leave after their 100th run of SBQ or after they realise they need to farm again, again and again to repair/change their build/buy a plan.
---
Why no raider tag?
---
Thank you for informing us. This was a necessary announcement and we so appreciate it. Keep up the good work. 
---
Thumbs up for the title. It made me laugh. Thank you.
---
Hm. That's crazy. Odd that it would happen but worst case scenario you are unique, best case scenario you bought some paint from the atom shop and it somehow got placed when messing with the frames. If that's the case you should be able to paint it back to normal at a PA station. 
---
check the wiki
---
Yeah I agree, there is a lot of whiners on here wanting super easy mode. I can solo any mob in the game with ease using an aa 10mm smg and it only does 68 dmg. 200+ dmg with that fire rate is absurd damage. I'm guessing all the cry babies here have no idea how to create an effective build. I wish the game was harder and had a new game + because I find it way to damn easy and have never touched a op exploding or tse weapon.
---
You sure are. My group has started warning each other before they agree to a PVP challenge.
---
Come back to New Vegas, the water's great!
---
Ive heard that some diseases like radworms double some effects but dont quote me on that, and i really dont like when theyre messing up with mutations it was one thing that was working
---
I don't think an AMA would work, too many trolls.
---
Rather it be like WoW's Live Developer Q&amp;As, have a preceding thread where we submit our questions a few days ahead of it and they sift through selecting the most frequent questions they can actually answer. 
---
Even if they give non-answers and don't answer every last question, it'd be something and cut down on the trolling factor. 
---
There is nothing legit about the complaint
---
They're probably just clearing the shelves to make room for the bloodied melee weapons.
---
Right?!  Dudes gone off the edge about what could have been solved by starting an alt and leveling to 50 in a new build.   Fuck a respec, reroll a character and give yourself some options for the next time they go through a nerf/buff wave, hell Make a few of em so you really cover the bases.  And if none of that's got it, then maybe this game just isnt for you and you got your money's worth out of it
---
I asked for email headers in a thread about someone getting banned for “innocent” behavior and got downvoted to hell.
---
It does for the more common ones. I mainly want to kill mothman. He's had it good for too long
---
So now I am thinking. What is she doing over there? There's about 12 dozen people to the north or west trying to kill you and she goes shopping maybe?  Or getting some Cranbery Cobler for the XP boost? Maybe a quick spa trip. We will never know.
---
Red-Pilled this week.  
---
-Completely wrecked 3 months of work collecting to set up as a merchant.   
---
-Gutted the demo build (I don't use TS(e)'s.  
---
-Wrecked the durability of ranged weapons at the same time they Debuffed them.  
---
-and they won't officially respond to my post with anything more than a "collecting data".  
---
[Bethesda the Mod Author community has been try to provide fixes to you since the BETA. You are still ignoring us and not using them..](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljowa/bethesda_the_mod_author_community_has_been_try_to/)
---
I don't know. Was it also raining? Could you see drops of rain on the black screen?
---
Yep. People get pissed off when you take away a source of income. Especially a source of income that doesn't require much effort.
---
Sounds like a good way to reintroduce the artillery duping method. 
---
Morbid curiosity.
---
Why are you so dead set volunteering your time defending an incompetent mega corporation? 
---
If I'm not mistaken, when you first craft the "Prototype" X-01, it's yellow. All you have to do to get rid of the yellow is go to a PA bench and set the paint to "Standard." You won't be able to get the yellow back without re-crafting.   
---
I wonder if, somehow, your X-01 got reset to the yellow paint? 
---
Ah I understand. I know I get duplicate plans from her almost every time if you want and are on Xbox I can run a few silos with you tommorow to help you get the loot back and do scorched earth. I haven't tried since the patch so I'm curious as to how fast a group can pull off a kill on the queen. 
---
I haven't tested this but I think I remember hearing that it benefitted from the automatic rifle perks for some stupid reason.
---
I wasn't saying that at all. He asked if I was "butthurt" because he can afford to buy better games.  I congratulated him. It was sarcasm.
---
Having trouble arguing.   
---
I can't even get them to officially respond other than "collecting data" to why they refuse to use the fixes we keep providing them.  
---
I'm so happy that you're banning the cheaters and cleaning up the economy in the process. As someone who works really hard on their characters and tries to min/max as much as possible, it was incredibly disheartening when I learned about people duping. It effectively made all of my efforts feel worthless, and I quit the game after reaching level 180+ within the first month of release because I felt there was no point. This gives me hope. I'm going to continue playing some other games for now (still playing Fallout 4 after 2600+ hours), but if we get fresh all new pvp servers and BGS continues to ban appropriately, and we see some more end game content, I'll be back.
---
Keep up the good work.
---
Pvc has always been a great area to farm plans
---
Sometimes, we just want to watch the world burn
---
Please elaborate 
---
This happened to me tonight on PC. I lost my Excavator Torso and All Rise. I'm more bitter about losing All Rise.
---
I always check the in game time. If the sun just went down, then yes. 4am, no way
---
[Considering how they've stated they are deciding who's being banned, you might have a point.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/)
---
That has happened to me before the recent patch. I'm trying to see if there is anything in common. Were you wearing Excavator PA? Was it raining at the time? Do you have any mods on your PA?
---
Got as a reward from some event, doubt they will just lay there. 
---
“I date sluts”
---
Is hardware or IP-banning not an option for these dupers? What’s to stop them from making another account?
---
Now you just have a bunch of whining fucks standing around waiting for the queen to land because nobody has a gun to shoot her down with anymore.
---
It also seems like nobody is launching nukes anymore. The whining fucks can't do it because they are running bloodied with no health power so they can't enter a silo to launch a nuke. The good news is the fucks no longer need to whine about a TSE one shot killing a legendary ghoul before they could tag it.
---
Nope. 
---
[And applying banhammers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/)
---
Banhammer: Apply directly to the forehead.
---
Idk, this patch Hotfix did many weird things, half tempted to log in and find out if this guys is legit by killing myself with a miscmod in my inventory 
---
Eh, ok
---
in fallout 76 you can find raider power armor in a cut throat shop type area it will be in a ring type place surrounded by bodies you can also find it in the train yard west of the vault and thats all i know i hope i helped
---
Looks nice! I am set up at the elevator, but on XB1. For resources close by, make sure you stop by the lucky hole mine for lots of lead!
---
I'm upset that the TSE nerf was too much. As someone who got mine legit, I feel that I am being forced to play melee to stay relevant as it does way more damage. :/
---
He is not a real raider
---
Thank you for the clarification and eliminating the fear of a legit player just bulking everything and getting banned for that. 
---
[Or, you know, based on other criteria...](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/)
---
I feel like scorchbeasts exist to waste your ammo and weapon durability. Neither the XP nor loot is worth it. If I see a scorchbeast outside of a nuke zone I just walk away.
---
Oh fuck no. NO!
---
Gary!
---
Not gonna lie, I had an anti-armor lv50 western revolver and I threw it away as soon as I realized Run and Gun movement speed bonus doesn't stack with others. Can't compete with rifles whatsoever.
---
Would drop the game instantly. 
---
There's been a buff to radworms that increases potency of mutations and a few bugs involved with the new added feature.
---
This is utterly awesome! I love seeing the game developers refuse to be pushed around yet still being completely respectful and maintaining communication with the player base.
---
Really should not post this on Reddit, We don't need more Nerfs ;)
---
But good data!
---
4d chess
---
I just thought of this the other day when taking some photos!
---
The complaint is basically saying explosive weapons should not have been nerfed. And I'm sorry but their damage was just waaay to high. 
---
It's already easy enough to kill anything in game with non legendary items, let alone weapons that give upwards of 5x damage. 
---
They needed the be brought on par with all other mods and weapons and now they are. The Nerf was much needed and I 100% agree with Beth's decision.
---
However I do believe it only should have affected legendary mods and not non-legendary explosive weapons (grenades, launchers)
---
I have a level 30 Mirelurk king, but I've heard a guy tamed a 91 deathclaw too which downgraded to 50 on re-login.
---
Hey nothing wrong with your way. I just think if you had to present to a client for a big project, that is where the plans would be useful. Or if you wanted to recreate something over and over to be the same. 
---
It's a new built in feature to prevent you from wasting ammo.
---
I’ll have to double check but I am pretty sure they are always up in Watoga and Harpers now.  
---
Don your Excavator PA, get wasted on some whiskey, and FIGHT WITH THE PRIDE OF A HUNDRED IRISH!!!!!!
---
&gt;The needs of the many , out way the needs of the few.
---
Yeah I'm *sure* you'd be perfectly fine with it if you were caught up in a ban wave for no reason just because it mostly caught "guilty" people... If I were banned from a £50 product because I had the audacity to play it the "wrong" way, I'd be fucking livid.
---
At \~460hrs in my experience has been maybe one disconnect every 7-8hrs; a friend I play with occasionally has experienced, I'd estimate, five times the SNRs and disconnects (in the same server) while I continued to play; his connection is solid but his PC is older and much lower-powered.
---
Honestly, I've no idea what the chances of being a server with a duper are, but if the resilience of players' connections can vary from client to client, and if duping can affect server stability, I could see the effect of duping varying by player.
---
It's all conjecture on my part and honestly, my original response was carelessly based on hearsay that duping was causing crashes and now I'm just trying to reason how that might make sense. Either way, server stability has improved for my friend over the past couple patches, so I'm happy for whatever they're doing. :)
---
(Hate to be that guy) Guerilla warfare.
---
That said, here's a thought: They have set up a system where they indicate they can track numbers of items collected. They then [publicly state what that number is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/) People being what they are, they go, "Oh, I'll just dupe a dozen high price items!"
---
They hypothetically can still track that. If you suddenly get 10 Serum Recipes or TSEs in a day, I wonder what they might do about it.
---
I suspect that they 100% knew on day one. You have to think of it this way - they’re a traditionally single player studio that is used to letting their fan base “cheat” with mods and console commands. I’d imagine the big hold up would be getting to a point where you’re willing to ban your player base like that, because you don’t learn to develop a combative relationship with a portion of your user base until you actually run a multiplayer product like this. In terms of the tools, they’ve clearly demonstrated that they have the tools. 
---
Beyond that, you shouldn’t adapt a disrespectful tone with people like that just because they disagree with you. What goal does that serve?  We’re just two gamers discussing video games here. It’s ultimately a meaningless topic so presumably both of us are just here to have a good time and discuss a game which I have to assume we both enjoy or we wouldn’t be here. 
---
&gt;Maybe this game is not optimized for Ryzen?
---
Most recent patch has introduced this for me as well, and I'm running Intel (i7-6850k at 4.3)
---
Does this to me, a lot. Usually at Whitesprings also. Xbox btw.
---
I played for roughly 2 hours tonight and love it. Ran into some minor bugs but with the way the game is setup it didn’t effect my gameplay. 
---
Lets add in the effects of sloped armor and see if you concept of armor dynamics holds up.
---
Yeah I get pretty frustrated taking 5 swings and only one hits the enemy that's so close it's touching my character.
---
Well that makes it somewhat cheaper atleast :P
---
I believe they where around the 1.5k mark from vendors, now they are closer to 5k :S
---
This clarification helps, now about those California or Mohave dlc rumours...
---
c:/cantwasteammoifyoucantplaymeme.jpg
---
Because I want a subreddit to discuss a game I enjoy, without insecure juveniles vomiting their toxic, paranoid world views on it for their little circle-jerk dose of affirmation? 
---
“Mega-corporation” is somehow synonymous with... what? Evil? Incompetence? Wrongdoing? 
---
They made something I enjoy. Don’t enjoy it? Go play something you do. 
---
And not only that, they invited me in early enough to provide feedback to the core game design and balance before they closed it off for good. I **really** appreciate that too. Fallout 4 didn’t give me this courtesy. 
---
I deleted it. PS4.
---
Explosive was the only other mod that equaled it in damage output. Explosive legendaries benefit from the demolitions perk, in addition their own weapon perk. 
---
In some cases, explosive was better to have. For shotguns, two shot only added an extra pellet, so it didn't receive anywhere near 2x damage. Explosive however, added 15 damage to every single pellet, and thats without factoring in demolitions expert. It was also much better with weapons that did low per-shot damage, like the minigun. If your minigun did 12 damage, then the explosive mod increased it by more than 100%, while also making it easier to land every shot with splash damage. I had an explosive minigun that did about 50-60 damage, but with a fire rate of 300. 
---
Yea but given the damage it took it is understandable how they went overboard on its nerf we all gotta admit that logically.  
---
Hopefully it gets rebalanced in the next few patches or hotfixes.
---
Emergency protocols heaps better than jetpack and other pa torso mods.
---
Hahahahahahaha. It's as if they were making fun of themselves with that Watoga storyline.
---
https://youtu.be/wpecBkdpiK4
---
Indeed, bota everywhere in this joke of a sub.
---
I've had similar things happen, both a couple weapons and PA pieces just vanish.  
---
Only looted that session, no selling or dropping and I log in missing my Right PA leg and a weapon.  
---
The rifle itself is kind of a common drop in cranberry bog events or crowned enemies, the plan i only saw once so farming caps would most likely be faster to get it. 
---
Thank you. I agree with 95% of what you said. Well done.
---
Good, get em! 
---
It also doesn't help that most max level enemies can 2 or 3 hit kill you, but it takes you 5x or more to kill them. 
---
A Super Mutant with a missile launcher can 1 shot kill me, but it takes 8+ missiles for me to kill him? Where's the logic in that.
---
Cap stash farming was something fun I liked to do sometimes. I don't see how that was such a massive problem that they needed to fix. People who enjoyed doing it did it. Now what do we, maybe small number of people, have to enjoy? I put up with a lot of crashes, disconnects, bugs, I just put up with it because at least there were things I can enjoy. It's like somebody thought, oh these people are doing something we don't like, so lets just screw it up for them. Because what we want is more important than the people who actually bought the game, and were still playing it, and still putting up with all the BS for months.
---
Well I don't dupe , nor would I keep some ridiculous amount of an item if it found it.  If I was banned for no reason I would dispute it and I would get unbanned.
---
The people being talked about here are claiming if you craft to fast you will get banned. Which as far as I know is factually untrue 
---
Agree 
---
If they add this I'm going to spend days collecting ballistic ammo bags and just spam them all over my camp just to troll everyone that drops by.
---
So you have a vested interest, okay got it.
---
For those of us on the outside it's been non stop bullshit.  Weeks of no servers, constant drops. Hiding servers from people didn't help. 
---
And, lol a dev room in a MMO.  
---
Yeah they goofed up big time. 
---
And if you weren't privvy to being a part of it, you would see the emperor has no clothes.

The BGS official Facebook page hasn’t posted since December, I don’t think they want to talk... it would be nice to get some accountability and explanations from the spokesmen Todd and Pete, but I assume their replies would be really PC and lawyer advised against, cos you know YouTubers would pick apart every word they say

Stealth fuxkery not sure if i tentional but rn when I get rad worms its like having Strange in Numbers but Im solo and then when it wears off its like I have partial benefits from mutations.
---
They changed rad worms in the community patch notes and they mentioned it in some posts because prior radworms didnt do shit and noe it fucks shit up.
---
You can see it in the community patch notes/changelog, the one where the guy points out the new mothman red lamp is just the regular red lamp with atom shop price.
---
Yeah played about 3 hours. Game is amazing and this game might be the next big thing. If it has the end game content to keep you busy.
---
Believe the hype with Anthem!
---
LMAO uhhh yes, free dlc forever and this Reddit is only 10% of the actual player base... People will continue to play for a while and it will always spike come dlc time
---
Hello i genuinely believe there to be a bug regarding the scorch beast queen fight that will make mobs spawn at double the usual number + strengthen the queens damage resistance, it would explain why half the community says shes now impossible while the other half brag about how easy she is to take down.
---
yea thats just the thing i  even tried with 15 charisma and that mirelurk king is biggest thing it would let me tame
---
I eagerly await this and any other esoteric game updates the developers choose to bestow upon us. Though I might suggest you try a more detail oriented game such as World of Tanks, if this is the sort of thing that interests you. I think it is safe to say that sort of combat redesign is beyond the current scope of 76.
---
thanks for the sympathy! Let's see what Bethesda says, though i don't even know if they're going to answer tickets
---
What vested interest? 
---
I’m a customer just like you. 
---
You quoted Bethesda’s statement and then used words they didn’t say in that quote to shit on them for saying it?
---
Adding on to your first idea, they could also then move the double/quad legendary effect to the secondary slot. It would make the double/quad effects much more desireable. 
---
Well Bethesda can’t fix anything without breaking something else so who even gives a fuck about duping anymore. If you aren’t participating or purchasing how does it affect you?
---
Thank you for the clarification. However, what about folks who "hunt dupers" and might pick up loot to dispose of it? Should they be worrying? Will they be ok as long as they toss it in a lake at their earliest convenience?
---
Why do you think his lvl matters? A highter level does not deflate the challenge of the game, you are just as weak at lvl 300 as at lvl 50. All you have is more perk options to switch to for utility. 
---
I def don't think it's my PC. I've argued with people who OC about it in game, coz they tell me it has to be my hardware. I'm always like, "No, it's the game..."
---
I can't say this is patch related for me, necessarily, since I've had this on and off since launch. It's really annoying, and gets me killed if I don't End Task the game.
---
Pro Tip for other victims of these crashes: Set Task Manager to always appear on top under options, so that you can actually close the game.
---
Man, does it feel good to come back to the fallout 76 reddit 27 days after a made this post and all I received was hostility, and see that I was right all along. The developers are doing next to nothing to fix this game. Still taking forever between patches (like if the game has an immense amount of content to keep people entertained), seems like they havent really fixed much of anything. And there is still no new content except for a PVP MODE xD the complete opposite of what everyone was asking for. I hope all you guys are enjoying the game lol doubt you still even play
---
Not to insult anyone's intelligence, but as there are yet no comments, I would add this:
---
One small thing that MAY have something to do with this is that some plans have prerequisite plans.  
---
Example: if you want the Shielded underarmor plans from the Enclave, you must buy the lowest first, read and know it, and then the next time you log in and visit the Production vendor at the Enclave, it will have the next higher plan.
---
Probably not the cause for all issues, but may explain away some. Cheers
---

---
I tried to dupe items but halfway through attempting I was like f*** this I'm too lazy. (Even though in other titles like skyrim I use duping a lot)then again that is single player)
---
It's called a double strike when the gas used for the ejection is too much for the return guide... Hence why grain I a so important in proper munitions. It will pass safety, and strike the next chambered round.
---
Nope.
---
TSE were the only things that mitigated the pathetic damage on these guns. Now without TSE all you see is shit damage and its saddening. Meanwhile melee does great damage and makes every other gun crap. The only standout at this point is the shotgun.

Some people's concept of "A good time" involves being angry and trolling.  The river you are responding to seems hell-bent on being either angry, or trolling, or frustrating signalling in hopes of continuing to be accepted by the angry in-group.

Not that it matters because Melee gets and insane 75% armor pen for 3 perk points

&gt;what specific items you’d like to be able to display.

Bones
---
There’s always a lot of bullshit stories after every single patch. This just seems like another one.
---
I once found a brown paper bag in the woods with exactly 1,000 empty Nuka Cola bottles.
---
Just leaving that out here.
---
I'm terrible with spelling and grammar, especially at night when combating saltiness.  
---
Oh no it's clear they can flag someone picking up more than X of something, and likely flag when someone crafts Y of one of the fun things used to cause server instability and dupe.  
---
But the serum recipes won't work (not trying to be a nay-sayer) as I know some guys who kill more then 30 queens every few hours, so getting 10 serum recipes is all in a day's work. TS(e)'s maybe, except they are garbage now, bloodied and furious is the new Meta, and I'm not sure Bethesda is nimble enough to understand that.  The problem is data-mining at that level, as in checking exactly how many items you looted of X (not a stack but individuals) would be a seriously,'seriously "heavy" operation. I used to do eDiscovery (legal based data mining for lawsuits) and that kind of thing over a network had significant and noticeable effects on the speed / stability, and the Government / corporations have done it, however as I understand it most have switched to secure locations with limited access to a "library" system were it logs each access of a file, because tracking everything was not realistic.  
---
They are likely using the tools we reminded them existed, and looking at the save files for the characters for abnormalities, maybe, just maybe, also pulling crash logs to see if certain commonalities occurred at the same time, but it's not realistic on a large scale to track every legendary picked up and dropped, it would be realistic to see if someone had 22 TS(e) shotguns that were identical, after they logged out. 
---
They Are all Greg damnit not Gary not Steve not even vendorbot just Greg.
---
Maybe your armor, weapon, something on you is bugged.
---
Doesn’t matter cause Bethesda already fucked that up by raising the price on everything, rare drops don’t matter when nothing has value. People are out here selling serums for 200 caps and you can resell them to vendors for 300... I’m sorry you feel so victimized. I’m here to talk about a mailbox not about someone’s hurt feelings.

In a world where a boxing glove hits 20x harder then 50cal

Those are still pretty shit too compared to how they were before. 
---
Some people play this game 24/7 - I've seen a lvl 425. My toons are lvl 120 and 13 - I play 2-4 times a week since launch.

If it barks like a fish and purs like a poodle it's a Greg damnit.

I actually think vanilla building in 76 is pretty good, aside from stairs. I just want more decorations. 
---
I did a tonne of building with mods in Fallout 4 (1750 hours). 
---
I run a 2600x Ryzen cpu and I have been have the same problem. Latest time was fighting the sbq
---
I figured these claims were bs
---
Buffout recipe would be nice too.
---
Check enclave? Robotics lab?
---
that is probably the most upsetting thing i heard today.
---
and an official reply from Bethesda that people will claim is a lie on their part. Because they just want to believe that.

---
How much are you going to craft and of what item?
---
I must have mathed wrong at some point, but still 10.6 : 1 is greater than 7.5 : 1 by a margin that only highlights how dramatic the effects of armor become on any weapon that isn't oriented around single high damage hits, the black powder weapons and two handed melee have a dramatic advantage in this game.
---
What's the point of a 500 round mag when it can still carry 250 rounds and reload in practically a second or two? I remember comparing two Gatlings I had and I was just sitting there thinking "Wait...why does this one somehow weigh more when it has exactly the same attachmen–nvm looks like this one has the shitty larger magazine mod that weighs more because I totally need to think about if 1 year of holding down the trigger until it empties just isn't enough."
---
You will need to provide proof that you have not been involved in mass duping at any point of time.

He's lying.

Good for you. Unfortunately not everyone is a forum poster that knows exactly what "too much" of an item is to pick up, nor does everybody act like a puritain that avoids any slightly odd game mechanic because of the ridiculous notion that they would be found guilty by association.
---
Pistols need to have their base damage doubled.
---
Tank killer needs to include Pistols.
---
Crack Shot needs to include +10%/20/30%dam bonus.
---
Also add a few more pistols, and or skins. I would immediately change my entire build and playstyle to play my Fo4 Inflitrator character that was Stealth/Crit build using a Silenced 10mm called the deliverer.
---
I would say ALL these would be needed to save the true pistol build.

---
Think Smaller less clunky 10mm in black. Sell Gold or silver skin in the ATOM store. hell sell the deliver or p99 skin in the ATOM store to be used on any in game 10mm and I would spend good coin on that.
---
Don't get me wrong i love a good friendly duel or gladiator royale but there has to be a closer balance between weapons, and of course buff Missiles and Nukes up there damage is horrendous for there ammo weight D:
---
Still rather them fix the problems before the PvP release thats how i'd manage the development if i was smart to make my money lol
---
Enclave also seems to clip through the Brotherhood of Steel "Bomber Jacket" outfit, the one that's the Soldier Suit with a jacket over it? This irritates me, since all the BOS underarmors are bugged when used "under" Power Armor, thus costing you 58DR &amp; Er, and 60 RR. The Enclave underarmor isn't bugged, but it's ugly (my god, the shoes!) so I'd be happy to wear it, if only it didn't clip through the outfit I like to wear.
---
I like the game, but I've just become bored with it. I'll probably play again when actual content is added
---
Every time someone claims to have gotten banned for something like making to many witch costumes, link to this post. 
---
They are clearly exploiters who after getting banned, are trying to cause trouble for the game. 
---
I made a strikingly similar argument the day after the patch and was obliterated in down votes. Once it was over -100 I had to delete my comment.
---
First time I have ever self censored.
---
The pure rage was unbelievable. 
---
Shortened my end game, immediately.
---
The Deliverer was the centerpiece of about 5 different builds I ran in FO4. Such an amazing weapon. Definitely amongst my all time favorites. None in this game come close.
---
IP banning is no longer an effective method for stopping someone do anything unless you're utilizing whitelisting in conjunction with it, something no video game will ever do.
---
HID banning is something you don't really see in video games for a multitude of reasons I'm not going to bother debating on Reddit.  Needless to say, it remains obscure and rarely used for many good reasons - if you really want to know more, I suggest you finding a few academic sources.  It's complicated and legality is involved, the chances of you getting an even 90% correct explanation off reddit is likely impossible (that's why I'm not trying, I don't know enough beyond the actual practice itself).
---
Buying new accounts is something they can do to get around it, but what would they do with this new account?  Cheat again and lose it again?  Play Legit?  Neither are likely.  They cheated because they didn't like the game the way it was.  Once caught, very few come back.
---
Sorry man, but if power armor can absorb the kinetic energy of hitting the ground at terminal velocity then a baseball bat isn't gonna do jack shit.
---
Id like to mention this here if its still relevant.. but I believe the game is a bit bugged as a peeping tom sent me into danger... while I was in a tree.. croutched.. (whispers embarrassingly) while I was in.. in porta potty. 
---
This is unacceptable! I have been violated in my private time! :'(
---
Johns aside, I have pretty decent sneak, lvl of said perk, chameleon armour, 2 pieces of shadowed combat boots, and one black cowboy hat which i believe give me superb stealthing abilities if i dont say so myself. 
---
6x damage is only 3x melee damage
---
They didn't sneak anything.  It was an unintended result people were exploiting.  They closed it.  Get over it.
---
East TN here!
---
I'll play more when it gets better. But right now it's taking up 30 some gigs on my hard drive. 
---
Crap just saw this. Dumped 40 pounds of plans at watoga after an sbq fight this morning
---
Oh good so I can spam craft my 30 soups still..good to know.
---
Try waiting for a minute before doing anything when you load in (don't even open pip boy or jump.) That's happened to me before in one place when I loaded in and moved too quickly. The game would crash completely similar to what you described.
---
If I could be an OP stealth archer with a companion and three sumoned creatures I would!
---
Get over the nosediving concurrent players. Bet they can see that.
---
So after Bethesda lied about Fallout 76 through their teeth, now suddenly they are paragons of truth. Give me a break.
---
damage also rises geometrically because of armor. A 10% increase in damage also reduces the effect of armor by 10%, once you cross the 200 damage threshold, that isn't hard for melee to do, armor stops being a critical factor and your damage to enemies rises extremely quickly.
---
One shot kills aren't as hard as you might think, a 50 damage gun is suffering almost 70% damage loss against targets that a 200 damage weapon only loses around 25%, meaning it hits closer to 8 times harder comparatively. 
---
Not all of them just a small handful of hotfixes 
---
I will be honest here, I do not understand what you are getting at. I am familiar with modern and historical armor designs. My earlier posts were intended to present a plausible explanation or visualization of in-game occurrences. The logic behind why things happen in Appalachia the way that they do is almost certainly driven by the development team's views on game balance. Your discussion on real world physics/characteristics of armor, while interesting, have no parallel in-game. Could you be more specific as to how this relates?
---
You live in a fantasy world.  For every player that quits, a new player starts.  This little revolution on this board is not as big as you all think. I have seen this kind of toxic delusion before with other games, and they are doing just fine.
---
Found it inside a safe in the ash region.
---
Agreed, I'd want to see you creating items people have already said got them banned (plasma guns, armor, etc.)
---
Yup
---
Hmm. I’ll revisit this and maybe revert the mod. I just like “maxing” out my stuff. 
---
O.o my stealth sniper is still one tapping everything, besides like mirelurk queens and deathclaw so honestly I think snipers stealth and crit builds are honestly fine ATM, so long as you land your weak points. And with the fact you can do it from miles out basically I would say ranged builds are better at combat, but melee is better for day to day use.
---
Right. I have done exactly what those players claimed to have done and wasnt banned. Knew it was bullshit. 
---
What do you mean?  No. I’m about as old as Abraham Simpson 
---
Nope, because there are people that enjoy it 
---
&gt; self-proclaimed...simulator
---
Was I the only one that didn't get the memo that "self-proclaimed" has been redefined as "not once claimed or even suggested about themselves"? Because I'm pretty damn sure Bethesda never said Fallout was/is intended to be a sim.
---
Its not a problem of wanting ez mode its the fact that melee has always been overpreforming. Before TSE was widely distributed, melee was the meta for one-shotting everything.
---
Melee builds got upset that TSE took their role and they whined and got what they wanted, time for melee to get the same treatment. 
---
I haven’t seen it either. Nor have I seen any of these new legendary hunting rifles with TSE being sold by the thousands. If you did see these duping services and were stupid enough to give these people your items, odds are they’d just steal your items and block you. 
---
Maybe pull your head out of your ass and think for one second... Why would they charge caps for duping services when they can just dupe nuka cola? 
---
That’s right, they don’t need the caps. And they don’t have a working dupe. This post is catnip for dipshits, like you. 
---
It’s sad when the only somewhat viable guns are goddamn black powder guns witch break after like 20 shots
---
Why did you censor it, if you dont mind my asking?
---
T45 helm torso left leg raider arms &amp; right leg.No rain no mods. This bug has followed me back to my camp even closing &amp; reloading the application has not fixed it. At this stage its unplayable. Bethesda &amp; the Ps4 network should be ashamed such a piece of shit got released. And i have been a fan of this game since Fallout tactics. I am about ready to un install this from my PS4.
---
I'm in reality world. Hardly anybody on my friendlist is playing. I haven't logged in since they screwed it up. Resident Evil 2. Division 2. Anthem. If you think from all the bad publicity, and the good will, trust and respect lost from long suffering fans is going to keep players trickling in to replace those leaving you are the delusional one living in cloud cuckoo land.
---
first post didn't get attention huh?
---
So should we reduce melee damage since they oneshot most things. 75% armor pen needs to be reduced to 36% like everyone else. 
---
I've had days where I feel like I can't get anything right. 
---
I just wanted to extend my most sincere sympathy to Bethesda Studios as they are on a 3 month streak. 
---
I am wondering if the software is not optimized for Ryzen - it uses a unique setup vs Intel, and devs needs to compensate. When other hardware is in your rig? Add in cards? GPU?
---
Honestly i trust you modders more then Bethesdas ability to actually fix issues.
---
I wish they would prioritize the private servers if they have given up on the game so the keys to the kingdom can be passed onto experienced and skilled hands at fixing this engines bugs.
---
That's it. I'm sick of all this "pipe pistol" bullshit that's going on in the d20 system right now. Handguns deserve much better than that. Much, much better than that.
---
I should know what I'm talking about. I myself commissioned a genuine revolver in the wastes for 2,400,000 caps (that's about $20,000) and have been practicing with it for almost 2 years now. I can even cut slabs of solid steel with my revolver.
---
Wasteland smiths spend years working on a single revolver and fold it up to a million times to produce the finest arms known to mankind.
---
Revolvers are thrice as shiny as Institute rifles and thrice as hard for that matter too. Anything a fatman can cut through, a revolver can cut through better. I'm pretty sure a revolver could easily bisect a paladin wearing full power armour with a simple vertical shot.
---
Ever wonder why medieval China never bothered conquering America? That's right, they were too scared to fight the disciplined Survivors and their handguns of destruction. Even in World War III, Chinese soldiers targeted the men with the handguns first because their killing power was feared and respected.
---
So what am I saying? Handguns are simply the best firearm that the world has ever seen, and thus, require better stats in the fallout 76 system. Here is the stat block I propose for Handguns:
---
(One-Handed Exotic Weapon)
---
400 base Damage
---
 x4 Crit
---
+2 to hit and damage
---
Counts as Legendary
---
Now that seems a lot more representative of the blasting power of handguns in real life, don't you think?
---
tl;dr = handguns need to do more damage in fallout 76, see my new stat block.
---
yep this is way I think you are seeing a lot less of the super high level characters now. They simply stopped playing.
---
They don't need the XP, they killed the SBQ 100 times, don't need anything she dropsand dont feeling like spending 100s or 1000s of rounds of ammo. They have most of the CAMP plans and have explored most place worth seeing.  Fights now are much longer, use up a ton more resources and all you get from the occasional Legendary is a Bobby Pin. this game in the last week really did a 180.
---
used to be 25% resource management and 75% running around kill or exploring. Now I spend 50 resourse management 10 % killing and exploring, and 20% farming repetitive areas for stuff to sell. 20% vendor hopping to get plans I really don't really need but its the only thing i can collect so I do.
---
ow damage high attack rate weapons suck.
---
The armor system in this game dramatically favors burst damage to an almost comical degree.
---
The ratio of damage to armor determines final damage, and as all enemies have a ton of armor any weapon dealing less than 200 damage per shot is going to be heavily gimped in terms of damage, not 20, TWO HUNDRED is the critical mass where a weapon's damage starts taking a heavy drop against enemy armor, weapons like the minigun are straight terrible, having their damage reduced by a factor of around 7, while a super sledge in it's base form is dealing around a third of it's damage, but with perks can easily reach the point where it does the majority of the actual damage listed while the minigun almost crawls to 1/4.
---
I did the math, against 100 armor a gatling gun needs only 25 bullets to out-damage a minigun's full 500, that is how big a difference 79 damage makes against 14, a factor of 10.6 rounds to one for a damage difference of 7.5.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
There is a handy chart at the side that shows how shafted a low damage weapon gets, with a 25 damage weapon suffering a 70% loss of damage against a target where a 250 damage weapon only loses 30%, meaning the 25 damage weapon has to hit &gt;23 times to do the same damage, and a 10 damage weapon has to hit 80 times, dealing a theoretical 800 damage to match 250.
---
ALPHA is king
---
Edit, food for though, a high level super mutant has 178 armor, so when I say 100 armor, I'm talking mid game trash here or assuming you have decent armor piercing.
---
Armor needs a rework in this game, badly, or at the very least the devs need to understand what armor means for weapon balance. They give higher level enemies more and more armor like a second health bar, making them exponentially stronger and demanding higher and higher alpha strike damage to overcome these higher and higher resistances, if all guns did the same damage per shot this wouldn't matter, but there are weapons like the minigun that struggle against the armor of level 10 enemies but can't be acquired before level 35, as if it is supposed to scratch even lightly armored end game threats, lightly armored in this context being 100 or so armor on the shirtless scorched who are the lowest armor enemies at any particular level, super mutants approach 200 armor, and some of the top end enemies can close in on 300 armor at the top end. Remember, 14 armor is all that is needed to cut a minigun's damage in half, so even giving it 95% armor penetration wouldn't matter.
---
Then there are energy weapons, that don't get armor piercing, have lower alpha damage to compensate the fact that "most enemies are vulnerable to energy damage" as the devs seam to operate, in spite of the fact energy resistance across the board is HIGHER than physical, a honeybeast, which is "vulnerable" to fire and cryo (energy damage) has 132 armor, and 150 energy resistance, those super mutants with 178 armor, they have 300 energy resist. If energy weapons had double the damage output of their normal counterpart they would only be about the same, and in many cases still far worse. Remember, there is nor armor piercing for energy weapons.
---
If you took all the armor off a super mutant, and gave them 10x more hit points then a minigun would kill faster, while a super sledge would kill slower and both would end up about even.
---
The system also makes buffing weird, double a weapon's damage and you nearly quadruple it's effectiveness because you also end up halving armor, which is why explosives were so over the top powerful.
---
I'm going to keep posting this where appropriate until the devs respond that they are aware the way they give out armor makes weapons completely imbalanced.
---
I'm not sure how someone proves a negative. I think the fact I only have a few decent legendaries and my stash looks normal would be proof enough. 
---
I hear BLOPS 5 is fun, you should try that
---
Because you have the ENTIRETY of the gaming world on your friends list.  No kidding your friends list is not playing it, you would be friends with other delusional players.  So go away, play what you like, and don't look back. You, and your toxicity, will not be missed.
---
and how many of those friends were tse weasels ? ;)
---
Just uninstalled 76. I give them a week and then some. 
---
Scrapped my bathrobe once; was sad. 
---
Yes I know fast travelling after it happens doesn't fix it. Nor does server hopping. You have to actually close and restart the game.
---
Makes sense
---
Definitely go play beat saber.
---
Hey look the shills have arrived to manipulate the votes!
---
I got my plan while adventuring - I did not buy it.
---
Absolutely, which isn't possible. Additionally, to see posts in an MMO community crying about bans for doing "nothing" and believe the posts 100% tells me you are *very* naive or duping yourself and planning to use the same tactic.
---
Go take a stroll through any popular online game forum, and search for "banned." You'll start to see everyone dindu nuffin'.
---
Totally agree. Only people happy are the original melee builds
---
I crafted a couple dozen boards and 18 throwing knives, then scrapped them - according to the posts claiming they were banned for regular crafting, they made about 20 items, then scrapped them immediately to "learn mods."
---
I accidentally scrapped my nice, but non-legendary shotgun in the process - you're welcome.
---
Yes bethesda needs to uderstand that it needs to change
---
Power armor also makes you immune to crippled limbs...
---
Melee could probably use a bit of balance yes. However it should always do a bit more damage than ranged due to having to close distance to engage.
---
Yeah melee does more, but you take WAY more damage. So it's debatable. 
---
Collective action is collective treason. Death to all in The Fujiniya base &gt;:0
---
OG Xbox huh?
---
Well I have knowledge about it.  If I had picked up something knowing what I know now , I'd get rid of it asap. 
---
I have however been banned from something, where I didn't do anything wrong. It fucking sucked and took what seemed like forever to get unbanned.  Shit I happened I guess . Im not some spiteful person now who hates the thought of anyone ever getting accidentally banned .
---
I’m a fairly positive person so didn’t appreciate the negative comments and people attitudes towards my point of view.
---
I felt I was very even keeled in my comment.
---
Going so far as to say there would be three groups of people angry. 
---
The duper’s for lost revenue.
---
The buyers for wasted money and now having to spend more on the next weapon of choice. 
---
And the monitors of people that actually farmed the legendaries that are punished for the bad deeds of a few people.
---
And I even linked it all to FO4 and how explosive was only a +15 damage buff. I didn’t think it was intended to be +200% DPS bonus. 
---
People just didn’t like what I had to say in the end. 
---
There's a damage reduction based on distance. Simply removing that would be a huge step in the right direction (as well as more realistic).
---
I don't care what kind of bugs need fixed or work that still needs to be done on this game, as long as cheaters are getting banned like this I will support you and throw my money your way. 
---
I think all parties involved can agree this game hasn't had the smoothest ride so far, but cheating in online games has ruined so, so, so many experiences and destroyed entire franchises. I admit to having sour feelings about the product launch, but I just cannot commend this company enough for actually banning cheaters instead of just threatening to do so. Way to nip this problem in the bud! This is the kind of move that tells me you're really in this for the long haul.
---
Seeing the actual fallout of banned, pissed off cheaters has revived my support in this game and company. I'll be duper huntin' and reoportin' through the weekend :) 
---
Ya the current 10mm fully modded looks like it should weigh 30 lbs.  It is monstrously over-sized even when i am in full PA. 
---
Melee dmg never touched TSE damage. I've always used melee. It's sad when a tse shotgun would roll up and not one shot 1 enemy but one shot 10 enemies in a single shot.
---
Check the train vendor at Grafton.  I know you can find the arms and legs there.
---
Thank you for banning the dupers/cheaters
---
Dont worry most of us knew the pleas were full of shit 
---
Even the original two never had "Simulator" in their tag lines.
---
I want to give you stuff to get this shared, but I am poor:[
---
I think any other game is better than this one in its current state.
---
I run marsupial, bird bones (lower str doesn’t matter to me, I only have 1 str and the game won’t go lower than 1), eagle eyes, speed demon, and Adrenal Reaction. I’ve got 3 Unyielding pieces too; I tend to sit between 10-30% health and as a VATS stealth sniper, the unyielding+Adrenal Reaction combo really helps
---
How on earth does hating that make you spitefull?
---
I you were smart and took just one you’d have no issue. No way to track that. I was not smart. I took the whole bag. 
---
Both the vendors in Grafton can have the plans.
---
Got mine through scrapping combat armor pieces.
---
Not the first time people had made stories about events happening with no proof of it actually happening. Gotta watch out for them sneaky snakes. 
---
Yo, I remember you, we had a good debate about guns a week ago. I still don't have the 'bullet sponge' experience everyone else attests to at higher levels. 
---
I've been leveling a sneaky auto pistol dude this past month or so. Aside from a scorchbeast or mirelurk queen, everything I shoot with my 52 damage pistol dies by the time I empty my action points. Whether it is critical headshots or sneak attack headshots, stuff dies quickly. Do you know the total health points of those level 60 charred ghouls? One critical headshot from that 52 damage pistol takes off 60% of their HP. I'm wondering what the interaction is between critical/sneak attack and DR. I'm thinking maybe your damage is added up by multipliers (headshot+critical/sneak+etc) before it considers DR reduction. What do you think?
---
I do not understand why you are sorry about any of this. I did conveniently omit (and was hoping to avoid) any mention of fall damage. It is difficult to reconcile with the other defensive properties of power armor. We are left with the curious situation where baseball bats are lethal against full plating, and fall damage is not even with frame only. It would be easy to claim "it is a game, not a simulation", however I was making an effort at concocting a believable scenario. I suppose that is futile in any game with what are effectively magic items. Are you suggesting we nerf everything and make the game ultra gritty and realistic? Are you just unhappy (like myself) that some assclown with a TSE pump action can one shot you even while you are in full power armor?
---
No need for profanity.  I have not seen anyone trying to rob me from my hard earned gear. I highly doubt you have either. I guess have fun spreading rumors as truth. You and the people like you will be gone soon enough.  Good riddance. 
---
An illegitimate source of income. 
---
Nah it was silverish when I first made it. Turned yellow out of nowhere. 
---
Maybe we hit the same bug from different angles. 
---
huh, must be a browser error. Did you spot  someone pretending to quit or claim they were banned unjustly because they were caught exploiting?
---
I'd be cool with that too.
---
Although it might cause some lag problems if there are 200 weapons loaded into one vendor.
---
As long as I can go to one spot and see it ALL, that'd be super cool.  I don't want to have to fast travel all over the map :)
---
Only thing I have to defend him is I started with a solid group of about 20 friends...none of them used TSE, and I’m the only one that still plays. Lots of people did fall off.
---
Either way I thank you for the info
---
You’re losing this argument, just so the only thing you know how to and give up. 
---
Can Confirm the sticky caution thing. It can be cleared leaving stealth for a little bit, or letting a trivial enemy detect you and then killing that enemy.
---
Don't agree on being detected. I've got 10 agility, 3 sneak, light step, and the one that lets you re-hide after detection; and I can sneak up face-to-face on lots of big bads.
---
No experience with owned turrets or wanted levels.
---
Nah. I like the game. It’s playable and the bugs will be worked out eventually. 
---
Do those Responder codes effect the plan list, I only ever acquired the support and I believe rifle codes, if there are others that effect the lists.
---
Yeah, they'd have to work out the "if you crashed" thing.
---
Ideally, it would keep your vendor in that server for 1 minute, and give a WARNING VENDOR CLOSING 60 SECONDS message with a countdown.
---
There's 0 chance after a crash you'd be in a new server in 60 seconds, and people who were browsing your goods would have 1 minute to make up their mind and buy :)
---
Not too much advantage in a respec, but if they do that the more money too them. It'd be funny as fark if kiddies are paying $5 to sneak up on my turrets or something.
---
Thing is, melee isn't really over powered, comparing vanilla weapon to vanilla weapon, ranged is significantly under powered!
---
Make the corpse size relative to the mob difficulty. Sbq would be the largest In the area. Other stuff such as sloths and deathclaws would be larger.
---
I can’t turn it in either and it won’t let me drop the damn thing. Woot
---
You are scum and one of the reasons this game and company are going down the tubes. You think you can lie and manipulate and bully people who bought a broken mess of a game and call it "public relations". You are damn wrong.
---
If someone very legitimately enjoys this game, I won't tell them otherwise. Who am I to tell them what they can and cannot like? If they say this is a great game, then I will correctly tell them that they're wrong.
---
and since you were SUCH GOOD FRIENDS with these people, did you question each one of them? Did they play since the beta? Maybe they were a bunch of try hard's who hit 200+ and decided to park it till the vaults opened /shrug. I suppose its like an ink blot test,just read in to it  as it suits us.
---
If you record a stream, you can prove you aren’t doing anything that would be bannable. To see if the system decides you’re cheating.
---
Same. I can stealth crit a level 65 in about half a combat rifle mag with commando perks. Rifleman with a similar weapon is pretty close.
---
That would be fun but do u think it could track other players, events, and stuff like that for every server u join? Not saying it can’t, just asking. 
---
I have but wont be on for about 10hrs

The science wing inside the enclave bunker.
---
I’ve had this happen a lot lately, it seems (at least to me) to be connected to PA armor pieces unequipping themselves. 
---
Usually when fast travelling, I spawn in with 1 or 2 pieces unequipped. Last night it was my X01 leg and jet pack, they weren’t visible on my character but I could still use the jet pack, in equipping them again the weight numbers fluctuated and it said I was overencumbered though I was (I think) 266/270. 
---
Also, as of the last patch, disease cures for rad worms suppress marsupial, so maybe that +20 from marsupial could be affecting it too? 
---
I agree, people shouldn't be bullied because they enjoy the game too. Are you standing up for everyone ,or just those that fit in to your agenda ? ;)
---
You get 20 caps for clearing out a workshop of baddies, just hop around the easy forest workshops and shoot the ghouls, dogs, whatever that spawn, collect 20 and move on
---
&gt; there will still be a significant transfer of kinetic energy which could lead to a harmful concussive style injury
---
If Power Armor–whose entire concept is centered around being a literal tank in human form so heavily armored it requires constant power just to move in–can't soften a blow from a goddamn baseball bat enough to feel like nothing more than a sudden solid push then I don't know why we didn't just stop trying as the human race after inventing chain mail armor since we clearly haven't improved much from there beyond aesthetics.
---
If you like it, legitimately have loads of fun playing it, who am I to tell you that your opinion is wrong? I'm glad you're having fun.
---
The moment you turn around and try to tell me it's a good game, then facts very blatantly point out that you're horribly wrong.
---
I play with all people I’m friends with personally in real life. We all played the beta. None of them hit 200. Maybe you’re just a cuck.
---
Server stability was Bethesda's excuse for why the stash limit was so low. They lied to us then, so they can't possibly be lying to us now. Smdh
---
Underhand shady tactics will not be tolerated. They will be exposed. Anyone can look at your post history and see you for the shill you are. No shit Sherlock detective work needed.
---
Thank you, I didn’t know that
---
Too risky dude 😂
---
NP :)
---
Different perspectives and opinons =shiiiil. Goootem
---
Honestly when leveling I never repaired armor because of the laughably high repair costs. I just equipped whatever random pieces I found as I explored and when something would break I'd drop it. 
---
Nope the fixed the KNOWN tag bug, the Bobby Pin wt rollback and the issue with bulked mats not being autoscrapped when crafting.
---
They added....Scrapping "ALL" now scraps ALL your bulked mats, Stealth is broken on many characters, Crit build nerf, broke 21:9, the SBQ now has a good chance of fleeing so far South she is no long killable, and several other issue I cannot recall right now.
---
Still no fix for the Repair bug.
---
Fun times.
---
Not having the same exact problem, but the past 5 or 6 I’ve looted (all of them since the latest patch) - and all I ever get is 1 cap. 
---
On the off chance I get banned, I play something else until they resolve the issue while leading a genuine Reddit pitchfork mob.
---
But I don't foresee that happening.
---
With my hard bargain filled a vendor can buy 3 Halloween skeleton costumes and have roughly 48 caps left. I craft enough of these every morning every day every week since I found the trick or treater and read the plan to wipe my vendors out of caps first thing in my gameplay.
---
Your claim is an outright lie.
---
I'm not a fan of how Bethesda has been treating the community, and even less of a fan of the horrible performance this game is giving the loyal long term supporters. 
---
But what I'm really, really not a fan of is people like you that straight up lie. This post should be removed, and so should your account here on reddit.
---
Posting a cheating video here is a good way to get banned. haha
---
It’s super annoying, really an inconvenience. 
---
1). You can’t sell serums to vendors because their value exceeds the max caps of the vendor. I’m convinced this was by design to prevent them from being accessible from any vendor besides Modus.     
---
2)  you made a suggestion. I pointed out that it would most likely result in the resurrection of an older duping method that involved storing items in a camp built container.  This alone will mean it wont happen as they won’t deliberately put something in they know will allow the exploit. 
---
Bet you will get on your soapbox and decry the "Exploiters" yet here you are exploiting reddit. Cheating this system. You fucking hypocrite.
---
well guess what? they arent wrong if they think that, because everyone doesnt think the same. You could just let them think that because they arent gonna change their mind if some random person says it isnt.
---
I’m on PC, I’ll see what I can come up with
---
and how many hours did you and your 100 member group of personal friends put in since ... October?

I mean every time someone quits the game, someone joins the game. The little “revolution” people are trying to form isn’t going to achieve anything but annoying the people on this sub ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

flimsy basis  returnofthelastjedi you might want to adjust your attack trajectory
---
You guys have lied to us before, what's to stop you from doing it now to make yourselves look better? I mean you were deleting comments from an upset consumer on your forums, and then banned they guy for 'baiting and bashing' and even if he was don't you think he has his First Amendment Right to say what he wants about your shitty business practices whether you like it nor not?
---
I just watched it, where was the cheating?
---
It’s good again. 
---
I met 2 guys, dumped the rest at watoga as well
---
Yeah, a week. That’ll be enough time. Yeah.
---
Lol, its not only the amount if you read their statement right. Its time vs. amount.
---
You cant accumulate so many Items in such short Time since the Game is out.
---
If you buy so much stuff from someone you are part of the problem and you will get banned, rightfully so.
---
That's zero proof. What's your argument against the allegation that you just sold off your duped stuff?
---
Also, you're making the claim that you're innocent. The burden of proof lies with you.
---
The fact this is getting downvoted is so sad. Like, there should be no way to disagree with this completely accurate statement. No one should be able to solo an endgame raid boss with a fucking melee weapon.
---
I am pretty sure that's how it works, the big thing is that in order to do meaningful damage you need a weapon with higher damage than your enemies' armor, which for ghouls and scorched isn't that bad, but hardier enemies with 200+ armor quickly become a pain in the but.
---
Most enemies don't actually have as much health as most people think, and after a certain point it becomes almost trivial to one shot them, you just need to get to the point their armor stops blocking 70% of your damage.
---
Headshots, critical, power attacks, anything that increases your damage does so more than the numbers say, as higher damage lowers effective armor, meaning even more efficiency.
---
Well, I assume it was an accident and not a new "feature" ;)
---
Not necessarily. If one is a duper to begin with (before the recording starts) but does nothing against TOS while streaming, it would appear that it was an errant ban.
---
One could even, easily, go so far as to report their own account, knowing they're a duper, in anticipation of a very public "unjustified" ban. If they're anticipating a ban eventually, why not get ahead of it?
---
Seems pretty complex and unlikely, but well within the realm of possibility to try to gain major public support and have their ban lifted or throw shade at Bethesda's system.
---
+karma
---
Not mention it matters a lot more if a rifle is losing its damage to enemy armor, since every shot costs ammunition and durability. Melee weapons only have to worry about losing durability. 
---
Melee also is much easier to make repairs for, since they tend to require metals, adhesives, maybe even plastic or leather. While guns will require you to repair them with materials that are needed for a lot of other different repairs/crafting, like springs or screws.  
---
The only advantage that guns hold is being able to deal damage to flying scorchbeasts. But scorchbeasts land once all of their spawned scorched are killed, so it would be much faster to just kill the scorched with melee, and have it land.
---
\+karma
---
btw the beer botles r not good for molotow in real life because limited size around 0.5L. 
---
Make sure you try with other weapons and armor, and mash the button as quickly as you can. Equip Super Duper for good measure too!
---
Oh come on, this is such a fun game!  What I do is
---
\- run around picking up tin cans and random garbage for steel
---
\- wait for somebody to nuke Whitesprings so I can farm hardened mass
---
\- wait for somebody to nuke the queen so I can farm raw violet
---
\- make some ammo
---
That's about it! It's really rewarding. I love it. I feel so fulfilled. I'm not being paid to say this, really. It's not like there's a chip in my head that makes me say these things, truly. I feel this game completely fulfills my human need for fun and entertainment.
---
High levels of negative points can affect your ability to post.
---
BGS doesn't need people to ruin 76's reputation, their shitty business practices (unfinished game, 1 step forward 2 steps back, Nuka Dark Rum, 'canvas' bags and now that $276 leather jacket) and the game itself does enough of that.
---
I got it my first or second time scrapping a .50 cal.  I don't think it's rare to get by scrapping.
---
People ***were*** saying they weren't duping before bans came about.
---
I have a lvl 210 or 220. Can’t remember where exactly I’m at. Launched nukes on FSP or Whitesprings almost daily after work and many times daily on days off. XP really added up in the zones before the nerf.

sweet..so its a good thing to have radworms..one disease thats beneficial...nice

I rely on random legendary drops for my sneaky build.

Chameleons, harder to detect in shadows, nocturnal plus any other buffs if multiple star.

I can struggle killing high level stuf during 6am to 6pm now but that's how I planned this build.

Just watched a player walk through solid walls while over encombered. Made sure to report as his walking speed was that of someone out of stamina even though he had been sitting still selling to a vendor.. from inside his cage... thats locked..
---
i can tame wild animals but they never return to my camp..how do you get them back to your camp?
---
maybe they just got tired of playing the game with you :(
---
Record yourself starting making a new Bethesda.net account and then make a new character and then do some mass crafting. 
---
I think you’re just over-dramatizing what’s really happening to make the current state of the game seem like garbage, because that’s what everyone on this subreddit seems to do. People that know a working duplication glitch wouldn’t post about it on LFG because that’s the fastest way to not only get reported and banned but also get the duplication glitch patched, which is a tool they benefit from.
---
Chances are the people who posted about duping services on LFG are hoping to find someone stupid enough to give them their gear to dupe, steal it, and then block them. Probably some kids serving up their dumbass Xbox live vigilante justice to people who dupe or encourage duping.
---
Which brings me to my next point- why is this subreddit like catnip for dipshits? 
---
The only way this would work if the bonuses only applied to PvE, or else there's no way to balance this. 
---
Because a video game studio out to get your wallet would never lie to you.
---
dont you need to learn the mod to change receiver? i have changed my reciever from prime to hardened.
---
I hope your right, but with the way things are going I wouldn't be surprised if they discontinue development. 
---
They got sick of Bethesdas bullshit without adding any content after 3 months. I’m a rather pleasant individual when someone isn’t being an instigating online troll.
---
Sure you just "found" it, sir.
---
What platform are you? I’ll give you a few hundreds caps if you can do the job for me. I don’t have any of those plans. I’m PC
---
They should be ashamed of themselves.
---
Also from turning in technical data, if you're far enough in the main quest line.
---
yup..sux
---
how many online games like this add major content patches after 3 months?
---
I'm not sure how much more I can shine a spotlight on facts vs. opinions. Until you can differentiate the two, don't expect me to continue with this rutted conversation.
---
Being creative with your interactions with other players, like today I went around dressed as Manta Man and went up to random players asking in a cringe filled attempt of a hero voice and helped them and just played around. 
---
What if he bought as many nuka colas as he could from everyone he could in a 30 day period? Does that make him a duper?
---
It would take a lot more than a few crap legendaries and normal stash. Do you have a mule character, for example?
---
I just got the tricentennial edition, entered the code but only got the paint and uncle sam outfits. No emote, frame or poster. The poster is in the atom shop for 400 atoms but that's it. Any ideas?

Same. My 8yr old son and I were having a blast killing ghouls with TSE, mininukes, nades...etc. With the total noobish EXPLOSIVE nerfs, it takes 4 nades to kill a single charred ghoul. My son said he was bored and hes done with FailOut76, so back to Terraria we went.
---
Well, my situation was hypothetical, but how many individual items would you say were taken at once? 
---
They take real time to arrive, and they are teathered to your My C.A.M.P so make sure your My Camp object is placed in a clearing outside your camp building, otherwise your pets pathing and spawn can go wonky.

---
iv never botherd with cap stashes..i make heaps of money selling my excess junk and chem/aids i pick up..usually make 1000 caps a day this way..im at 10k caps at the moment. and iv spent a lot of caps buying stimpaks and plans serums etc....iv probably only got caps from cap stashes about a dozen times since i started playing. probly make more caps just killing super mutants than farming cap stashes imo.
---
So you take rads down to where you want to be? I guess that makes sense.
---
Prob the Silver Shroud trench that is available in the atom shop.
---
I didn't say it was probable, but it certainly isn't impossible.
---
I too, agree. It should work like passive against other players, or like being in a team (you can’t blow up your mates base)

Try walking around her and activating her from different directions. I've had this happen before with certain robots, and that fixes it each time.

So if this is reassuring people that saving up to open a store won't get you banned, does that mean that you'll be able to have your own vendor/vending machines soon???

less popular becuase the tse and other nerf like mule nerf many "elite" player left tha game.

I was paraphrasing slightly, but you should review the promotional materials for Fallout 3. I believe it was the plastic sleeve for the Lunchbox edition.
---
"Vault-tec engineers bring you the latest in human ability simulation the SPECIAL Character system!"
---
"The wizards Vault-tec have done it again! No longer constrained to just one view, experience the world from 1st or 3rd person perspective"
---
"Our best minds pooled their efforts to produce an advanced version of Radiant AI, America's first choice in human interaction simulation"
---
Yes, you got me. My earlier statement was not a direct quote. Fallout 3 did however present itself to the consumer as a simulation put together by Vault-Tec. It was a fun bit of immersion.

Can easily get same numbers on a Gauss, dragon or black powder. Also that is on a glass canon build with your hp under 20%

That is entirely pointless and not helping anybody. Just leave it where it is. When you find radioactive waste spilling out on the ground you don’t scoop it up you get the hell away from it lol whoever picks that shit up is marked for death
---
It seems like critical or sneak headshots is the way to go for any firing mode for pistols or rifles.
---
I'm curious about some of the heavy weapons though. I'm wondering if the AP cost on the minigun would allow you to build around concentrated fire headshots. The damage ramp from that perk or furious legendary prefix may solve a lot of problems.
---
I'm guessing it's buyer beware, I.e. I don't see them refunding us.
---
Ever play world of warcraft?
---
Full stealth build with full legendary shrouded wood armors. getting this bug.
---
MMO Lites are like their own little new trend. GTAV really is what started it. It’s an MMO in every sense, while typically limiting  server capacity between 24-48 players.
---
probably good idea to invest some point into damage reduction perks...
---
btw don't use rockets... just becuase the explosive damage nerfed to useless level on last patch.

The fun was over once I went inside West Tek.

People are literally making money by cheating. They dupe stuff losers want and sell it for real world money.

Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda would like to remind you that fun is subjective and that a satisfactory experience an area we are actively working towards degrading. If you feel that enjoyment of the game is inadequate, please write an essay explaining why.
---
That sucks, you had that one in the bag. Side note, am I the only person who thinks this game is a little violent for young children? Kind of interested in getting my nephew into it but not quite sure it’s appropriate. He does play Fortnite so he’s already played a “shooter” game but I feel Fallout is rather dark. Opinions?
---
No I never have but I did play ESO a bit and FFXIV for a bit as well. Not long enough to see  anything like this happen though.
---
Me too. I don't even use laser or plasma
---
This is purely Quality of Life, but one thing I like in these games are making multiple characters. I wish there was a shared stash like ESO/Diablo, or a mailing system (perhaps at the train stations) like WoW, or a small seperate stash just for swapping items between characters like Borderlands. 
---
I know it’s survival and all that, but the amount of grinding is immense, sometimes it’s nice to start a character that has access to junk and ammo, and sometimes on my Heavy Gunner I’ll get a good Chameleon armor piece that’d be great for my Sniper. 
---
People already do this by trading with friends, but that’s a lot of hassle and loading screens.
---
Thanks for listening! Keep up the good work, devs! 
---
i can pacify but how do you tame? iv never had the option
---
You make an excellent point. I am not certain who you are trying to convince, pretty sure baseball bats are still potentially lethal if suboptimal weapons in game.
---
The post literally says banned for being in possession of the items it doesn’t say anything about how they come about getting them. Picking up a stack of obviously illegitimate items sounds like it falls into that category to me. 
---
true i saw most players aorund 20-50 on last few days. probaly they started a new toons for melee build or just get banned and brought  a new account. btw i always dorp then unvanted legendary items, plans and amo.
---
On PC?  
---
A couple mods can cause this, disable all mods and try again.
---
Love how ridiculously OP weapons are now "nerfed and useless" when they're really just more like the original intent.
---
If you’re on the PS4, I’ll upgrade them for you.

My experience exactly parallels the author of the OP, whom I salute for expressing so clearly and concisely a series of observations and judgments with which I entirely concur. Bravo. +karma

Can confirm, I've seen it here reliably since the patch. What I *can't * find is Small Letters. Does anyone know where those are? 
---
So relatable :D Im in the middle of respeccing my melee build just for scorchbeasts, been a few times where a SBQ gets sploded before i can even tag it on landing.  Also attempt to do sweet jumps and try to smack it for the lolz / in the meantime.

I traded with a random the other night. His 2 shot AA lever rifle does more damage than my 3* TSE lever rifle. I had 24 level points to spend, so i am now a low health melee build. My TSE handmade now does 129 damage as opposed to 488. Bethesda have forced our hands in this.
---
No it’s bugged so you can’t switch 
---
Also I have over 75% armor pen with the 10mm smg I'm using.
---
Damn, just damn
---
I was expecting more like you and the Scorchbeast having a stereotypical slumber party pillow fight: giggling while slapping one another with pillows clearly incapable of killing one another while a real threat: the Predator (basically a Mirelurk Queen in game) can sneak up on you if you don't bother to pay attention every few minutes and do some actual relevant damage if you don't react kinda soon-ish and pop a consumable then slap it away with your pillow a dozen times or so.
---
Making caps harder to get with caps stash nerf, jacking up plan prices, nerfing the most duped weapons, it's almost as if they are trying to promote real money trading. It's almost as if they want to make things so difficult, dull and tedious for their remaining players and push them to sites to buy caps and whatever new flavor of the month OP weapon. It wouldn't surprise me at all if they had some shell company doing most of the RMT selling, since the backlash against pay to win microtransactions selling it themselves would bring a lot of ire from the players. But they conveniently have "dupers" to blame for the server instability and TSE weapon saturation. So a win win for them really.
---
Harpers sells it
---
Me too. It stopped working for me after the Tuesday update.  
---
Same, I hope they haven’t removed it ffs
---
That's *supposed* to be balanced out by the fire rate difference.
---
It doesn't always work out exactly correctly, but an Automatic Assault Rifle deals about 90% of the base damage (~87.8% of the effective damage assuming non-negligible armor and a FO4-like armor curve) of a semi-auto Assault Rifle per shot, but fires at nearly double the rate. It needs around 13-14% more shots to kill a target, but it delivers that kill almost 65% faster (ignoring reload time).
---
When you have extreme damage vs RoF differences (i.e. a Minigun vs a Gatling Gun, or worse the LMG vs a Hunting Rifle) ammo conservation (and potentially reloading time, particularly for rifles) becomes as much of a point of interest as the overall-DPS question.
---
Your effecting the server, it's a widely advertised and know issue that spam crafting causes instability.   
---
    
---
We've begged them to add a crafting slider
---
It's a trap
---
Todd Howard here, the two shot and explosive attributes on the guns were nerfed so that defensive items can be viable. Defensive items such as the new atomic shop Unstoppable! character costume which is available until February 4. 
---
One time (also at the Whitespring) I tried to point out a legendary that a low level player (lv15 maybe) had tagged but didn't loot because the body landed out of sight behind a car.
---
I know people sometimes shoot at bags to point them out, so I shot at the corpse but accidentally hit the car instead, exploding it instantly with us in the blast radius. They survived but avoided me after that.
---
This angers me more than it should....
---
Full disclosure I haven't played 76 in like a month, but last I played. I was pure melee build. Had a fucking grognak axe with melee penetration and some other bs.
---
I could 1-shot literally anything I came across, with 3 exceptions.
---
* Mirelurk queens would take several hits, like 5-6.
---
* Scorch beasts would take maybe 5-10, at this point I can't remember, but it was entirely dependent on if they spam fired blasts forever (depleted my AP and I had to sprint/dodge) or if the landed, I could full-on sprint power attack and take them down half their life. So it was like 2 hits vs 10 depending on if it bugged or not.
---
* and the queen..... who, I have never done noticeable damage to, ever. I can oneshot everything that spawns during, but no damage I can see to her.
---
I actually have a few toxic goo. What does that do?
---
And sadly, though they claim to have mostly stopped the duping the server stability is still shit. I average a disconnect from server once an hour and a crash to blue screen on PS4 every three hours of play. I'm really beginning to believe that these things are not even considered in their updates. Nerfing and increasing the grind are the goal I believe. Not to mention that energy weapons have been shit from the word go and zero effort on Bethesda's part to "balance" them.
---
Not just weak. There's something seriously wrong. We nuked Site Prime tonight. SBQ came out and firstly she wouldn't land at all and we had everyone on the map UNLOADING on her. She would also fly through and disappear into the ground which was pretty not awesome. We had guys with TS Gauss rifles. Explosive mini-guns. Ultracite weapons and heavy weapons. We did almost zero damage to her until she landed and everyone could run up and melee her. My friend blew through 30 mini nukes 30 quantum grenades and 2000+ rounds of .50 cal. At the 10 minute mark on the timer we got her to respawn her health. Was SQB glitched? I'd have to think so, but got damned we wasted so much fucking ammo, stimpacks and drugs.
---
I've done end game stuff in other games and holy shit nothing compares to the shittyness of FO76's endgame. I am used to wipes because the raid can't get their shit together during a boss fight, but the entire fight I was able to run around right under the SBQ DUMPING ammo with my explosive weapon and my two shot and her health bar never moved.
---
It sucks because two of my friends, which I made through this game, basically said enough is enough and are moving on to other games. I mean we can do discord, but I liked playing Fallout with them.
---
This is priceless...
---
That's correct.  And?  This happens in every single video game that people can trade in, as well as most things on the internet and the world to one extent or another.  You can never stop it.
---
You can do the best you can with a reasonable amount of resources at your disposal.  It's not smart business-wise to dump resources past the point of reasonable return to try and achieve something that is impossible.
---
Welcome to the real world.  Breaking the rules is encouraged and is, to one extent or another, how most people get ahead.  Enforcement really only exist to use against people that aren't liked, or people cutting more into your profits then you'd make ignoring them.
---
TLDR - Preventing cheating is impossible.  They do the best they can with whatever their research tells them is the break-even point for preventing it.
---
His camp spot can suck it. At least it was profitable.
---
Oh. Our enchanter got off their 9 second stun. They're just paste now
---
sorry ps4
---
Shame....shame....shame....shame....
---
Yes if you nerf 2 Legendary effect their weapons dropping their DPS by 80%. Nerf the Demo Expert, Nerf Crit builds, break stealth and not give then a decent Respec, ya you will Lose a lot of "elite" Players. 
---
The TSE nerf was needed but was very poorly done. Fix the Bobble head cheat, make demo expert not apply to the legendary effect Explosive weapons, this would have been enough to balance it out. Beth just took it too far.
---
You’re not dumb, I do that too. Wait, are we both dumb?
---
I like buying them from modus cos I feel like I’ve really earned them, more gratifying that way 
---
ok..i heard you havr to tame not just pacify..iv never had thw tame option
---
I don't think anyone could even prove that dude. What proof would you like to see for this situation?
---
Previous patch introduced up to 9 CTD's and hour, and I've played since beta and never, ever had one before
---
oh man a crafting slider would be awesome indeed..
---
I like how he primo gold one at the end always just spits out some shit. Usually super anti climactic like awwww yeahhhh oh. It’s another hydro-boy.
---
Out there laying some pipe and letting all the locals know where they can get some.
---
Happy cake day my good sir/mam
---
Hard to say since I can’t get to my account now but it was a silly amount. It was a couple days before the bans started. If I saw it now I’d know it was asking for trouble. 
---
I am torn now between perks since you can create so much ammo on your own is some thing like scrounger even worth it?
---
They don't spawn at fort defiance desk anymore?
---
People commenting on the post (with a lot of upvotes) were claiming what I said.
---
Yeah go ahead. Go to the bottom right of the map. Cheers. 
---
Sorry, but it would have mattered to me months ago. Now I just don't care because I stopped playing.
---
Dupers aren't the only problem Bethesda. A cesspool of toxic gamers have set up shop... but not literally... in the Appalachian wasteland because they show the same amount of disdain for your game as it seems you do.
---
I stood by this game because I have always enjoyed the worlds you have created. But the mishandling of patches, mishandling of toxic communities, and misaligned priorities have tainted your brand. Not to mention that the product just isn't up to typical Bethesda standards. And to think you all destroyed Obsidian because of "poor" reviews and lower than desired sales of New Vegas. What goes around...
---
It's time for a change. Good thing I got Fo76 on disc so I can trade in to Gamestop before the next console generation puts them out of business... 
---
I'll get 10 DOLLARS out of it...
---
R.I.P. Bethesda as a good company
---
FUN FACT: You can get $8 in trade for Skyrim Special Edition and $2.50 for Fallout 4.
---
I probably wouldn't mind as much if I didn't build my toon around the TSE. Now I need to respec and with lack of content and more grind with each patch I find it difficult to even log in and for me that's a sad thing. I have thousands of hours in each of Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Fallout 4. To say I'm a fan would be an understatement. I fear this experience will turn me off of 76 and any future titles.
---
My friend told me to give it a year and it will be a solid game. I'm not sure I'm even willing to do that given how many times they've stepped in shit with 76 in such a short period of time. Their patches are akin to the inmates running the asylum.
---
With how weak tse guns are, no ranged weapons are worth fighting the scorch beast qween with. Same for any scorch beast for that matter.
---
The cost vs reward is not there for people to even want to go near them.
---
Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda see your idea as reasonable albeit grossly underpriced. We feel an adequate retail price for such a boost would be $10 usd or your regional equivalent.
---
That's his only comment too, so highly doubtful.
---
Figured as much - my own cousin once threw a tantrum because he'd been banned from all PS4 online play "FOR NO REASON" and it turned out he'd been doing everything from making racist threats to installing mod chips to phishing. Cheaters are cowards who'll never admit to it, but they sure do love attention!
---
I had this happen. Let the chiefs die, then go into the room where they came out of, And use the terminal to get new chiefws.
---
Yea, before nerf I could launch 3 nukes in a row. Now I need ~ 2k ultracite .50 ammo for each SBQ. A bit expensive, isn’t it? Especially with her garbage loot. 
---
A very spiky one
---
/me shares a 3\* Patience perk.
---
Beth main doesnt do this game, Austin does. And it feels like the 2ish (active!) community managers are the only ones in touch with the reddit salt factory :/ &lt;3 &lt;3 Just because they relay info doesnt mean anyone acknowledges it, or that things arent in the works or time/priority for it within the company.
---
Yes things arent ideal at the moment. As a lifelong gamer(25+ years), ive noticed that a lot of games, especially AAA companies, arent fantastic at launch. Aside from path of exile, most games ive played in the last few years have major flaws.  Recent WoW expansion, Civilization games, etc etc.  And many are vastly improved over the course of time, or through community mods.
---
Its easy to be frustrated and I can understand it, but just be patient or play something else if you arent enjoying it currently. Constructive criticism will hopefully be seen by the devs, or at least by modders.
---
That all being said, Fallout is one of my most beloved franchises, and I would love it for Beth main to support their offspring properly, this has the setting/nostalgia/potential to be one of the best games ever if done correctly. My hopes are for more balance, more endgame and coop/pve endgame. Larger map? etc.     Games like civ 4-5 for example took multiple PAID xpacs to become what i think of as having been good games, give things some time.
---
There's a class action lawsuit going on atm.
---
I’ve tried multiple times on the paladins desk and got nothing. I finished belly of the beast awhile ago. Would they spawn there without the quest being active or just recently completed?
---
I've done that about 4 times nothing is happening. I guess it's just bugged
---
..
---
Preferably, a fresh account, but that'd be hard to get hold of. As such, if OP doesn't get banned, it proves that Bethesda is not banning for crafting, and if someone did get banned for crafting  (very likely untrue) it was a genuine mistake. On the other hand, if OP does get banned, it proves nothing. He may have duped and got banned but we'll never know.
---
:( keep on a truckin'? Yes itself bugged. Mine never went passed 25% until i went and got new chiefs... :( i am sorry 
---
I fell like ranged weapons should get a damage boost based on their relevant SPECIAL, like melee does with strength.
---
Rads.
---
I think out of all the Fallout games, 76 is definitely the lightest. With no human enemies combat is pretty much fighting "zombies", dorky robots, and monsters, I think that's perfectly fine for children but it depends on what they are already exposed and comfortable with. Any of the deep stuff that gets to us in the holotapes would probably fly over their heads, and without any in-depth dialogue system you don't have anything to worry about like ghoul hookers getting fresh with them.
---
I mean, my dad and I grew up playing Mortal Kombat together and my cousin and I played Japanese horror games on the PS2 and none of us are in jail yet so it really depends.
---
Ok cool so I'm about 75% complete on plans
---
Probably the max weight limit.
---
OK. My level 50 Western Revolver hits at just under 100. As its 20% speed, it is equipped a lot of the time. It one shots all kinds of trash and I sometimes just shoot the bugs out of the air instead of getting out my knife. With the Long Barrel and a Reflex sight its accurate out to ridiculous ranges and head shotting Ghouls is cake. 
---
 I use mine a lot, although I pull out the Lever Action for more serious foes.
---
Just you wait. Soon  Melee gets nerfed into oblivion... Then VATS Crit Builds... then Stealth Builds... Then the Cryolator.. Then the Fatman does just a tad more than... Oh wait no they already nerfed explosive weapons.  
---
Yeah.. I deinstalled the game for now. Hopefully they reconsider what they have done.   
---
TS itself was absolutely fine. They maybe just should have used the Explosive Mod from Fallout 4. Doing like 15 damage.  
---
But nope. Every must be nerfed to oblivion, instead of trying to fix or buff everything else. Simply because it is... well simple and easy to do. Buffing Energyweapons? Do you know how much work that would take? They would have to sit down for more than a day to do that. Can't have that!
---
&gt;But when something doesn't work, and we look in the client side file, and there is an error, it's possible it's different on the server side, but it's more likely they are the same on both ends, hence why X doesn't work properly.
---
LOL that doesn't even remotely follow. You're not very good at this, certainly not knowledgeable enough to be telling anyone else their points are off base.
---
&gt;To date, the majority of accounts that have been turned off are accounts that have managed to collect over 500,000 (in some cases, tens of millions) of specific rare items (for example, Halloween Candy, Nuka-Colas, or Ultracite Scrap) inside of a 30-day period.
---
/u/BethesdaGameStudios_ does this mean that players who actively hunted dupers and stole items from dupers to hinder their duping exploits will be banned as well even though they did not dupe or use any exploit at all?
---
I was just thinking today that it would be nice to have some way for CAMP creators to leave some sort of short note or terminal entry for passers-by to view, to which they could respond. How about integrating that with your mailbox idea, which I also like? 
---
Your idea presumes, I think, a *persistent CAMP container* that can be accessed by other players,  correct?
---
This is what you signed up for
---
Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda recognize that saving player modified character was a standard option in previous games with the use of mods. Sadly due to the storage space and bandwidth required to have such a database we would be unable to implement such a feature smoothly enough to meet Bethesda’s high standards.
---
I'd rather have a mail box that's a mail box, let me mail a friend an item. Let me mail another character on my account a badass weapon or armor I found, to them with out having to wait for a friend to log in.
---
I agree, it was pretty shitty of them to do it, with thr fact people have built around tse, such as myself. I am down to 15 points left now after respeccing yesterday. I tool 3 points off rifleman and got rid of the 5 for demolitions.... demo literally put my damage from 129 to 142 on my handmade tse. Like, what is the point? 
---
I think the analogy you are looking for is bethsda laying shits, with us having no dog shit bags on the walk. Kinds wish i hadn't told them we are going walkies now! I almost quit after the nerf. I logged on ans saw all my weapons not even halved, but downgraded to 20/25% of their original output. I struggled to kill 3 protectrons in watoga, in 5 shots each. It just needs sorting!
---
The weapons were not the issue, it was the abuse in pvp, with stacked bobbles and glitched armour. The problem is, the same issues that they did the nerf for have not gone away. People are still getting one shotted.
---
Sounds like a perk
---
Better solution. Make the faction vendors not share caps. It makes no sense. Like i sell stuff to a robot in one station take all his caps and go to the next town and the other robot is like "oh sorry i gave you all my caps in the other town" what the shit? Or other option make their pockets bigger so they can hold more than 200 caps. And if i buy something for 50 caps the vendor should have 50 caps available again since i just have them to him. But no you buy ton of shit for hundreds of caps and the vendor is like okay i now have 10 caps. -_-
---
Some kinda Agility perk
---
Irradiates the heck out of you. 
---
what perks do you have? you might have applied smthn that allows you to avoid damage, usually for AP. i haven’t been on in a while forgive me if i’m not 100% but i am more than certain that may be what’s up 
---
Pretty sure they know 
---
The economy is likely not destroyed because it hasn't come to it's full potential. When they release 5star items everything you have now will be worthless.
---
Well sorta. When they aren’t already engaged it is. Its still almost a one shot every time
---
&gt;no headlamps
---
This part kills me. At least they updated the brightness...
---
quest definitely bugged, done it in discovered clown costume twice and it still shows up permanently.  Sidebar: that area is creepy AF, not bothering to go there ever again unless some sweet loot lol :D  One of the most immersive environments/quests in the game.  Dont do it at home alone at night :D
---
&gt;passion
---
'Hoarding' is the word you're looking for.
---
I agree with you 100%. I don't PvP at all so I don't know if there is a particular build that can handle a TSE with any effectiveness.
---
On a side note, I'm level 104 and with my TSE Handmade I could 3 shot a level 52 Mr Gutsy and now I tried it and it took 30 shots. 30!! That's one hell of a nerf right there. Strangely if I can withstand their attack I can kill them with three or four swings of the unmodded Deathclaw gauntlet. Makes me wonder if Tank Killer wasn't nerfed in some way. I'd expect that to work on the Mr Gutsy.
---
From what I've heard 24hrs
---
Yeah I suppose the holotapes would be the source of most of the suggestive themes. Some of the monsters are pretty creepy too though, just don’t want the kid to get nightmares and his parents get mad at me for introducing him to something M-rated. Not even gonna get started on Chems, they’re just buffs for us but in the game they’re portrayed as hard drugs with needles. Language would also be an issue I think.
---
Armory in white springs had it for me. 
---
It’s probably just serendipity.    
---
They resupply their caps 24hrs after you last sold to them. there is no server reset it is based on the last time that character was last there.
---
Mods are refreshed every server hop or login.
---
other items like plans are now static.
---
They have some basic weapons that are randomized upon login/server hop but what they have for weapons, apparel and aid will depend on what has been sold to them by players recently.
---
24 real life hours? No freaking way
---
No vote manipulation going on here.
---
Nothing to see here folks.
---

---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
What experiments?
---
It *is* written that they can ban you at any time for any or no reason with any or notice so they don't actually need an excuse.
---
I could be wrong but from what I've heard it's 24hrs. Im more than happy to hear what the real number is almost as much as you
---
It's somewhere around 20 hours.
---
I like the one you find in the locked fridge in the flatwoods cafe
---
I'm not sure there are X-01 mod plans being sold. If someone has found them please correct me, I would love to be wrong... ;\_;
---
People only asked for the legendary explosive effect to not be able to spawn on a weapon having the TS mod already and to have demo expert only partly affectining  E legendaries.
---
They never asked for demo expert itself to be nerfed *with every explosive weapons* and TS nerfed. 
---
Which in return cause the problem we're in now.
---
You can blame people all you want ultimately we are not the ones who made the changes.
---
Good  knowledge, but couldn't we make molotovs out of any bottle  in FO4 or was that only beer bottles  too? I honestly can't remember.
---
PS4 
---
Travaro4
---
I'm tired of constant fear of being killed by players, I just got hit twice and killed, 2 times in a row and couldn't fight back because I'm in passive. I had to change worlds and lost everything I was selling.
---
Also I had to stop using Reactive Plates on my excavator because players with low health could hit me and it reflects there damage killing them and making me wanted, WHILE I'M IN PASSIVE. 😑
---
Passive players should not have to worry about being killed unless they are wanted.
---
And I don't even kill wanted players because it's so much f*cking effort to change in and out of passive. 😑
---
I think that I've been getting some form of this today. Whenever I entered or exited my PA, it played the faster combat animation.
---
AWESOME... AWESOME... AWESOME...
---
does it have +200 carry weight?
---
It's 20hrs fyi
---
Sounds like serendipity
---
Its almost if its a coordinated trend. First it was goodbye letters now its a string of friends list posts. We should just make a super sticky so people "looking for friends" can regroup and add each other. Light is at the end of the tunnel, make new friends to play with!
---
I've been doing what these people claimed to have been banned for; making and then breaking down multiple batches of metal armor everytime 20 or 30 in stock before scrapping them to try and learn the mods multiple times a day for multiple days. I haven't been banned and I have no reason to think I would ever be banned for crafting normal amounts of items and then scrapping them. This is just like the past with false information just to stir up drama; remember the fake trading scams that supposedly happened and how they shut up as soon as they were asked for actual proof. Deja-Vu scumbagery.
---
Yes I’ve just checked there that’s it... which is odd because it was popping up every single time. 
---
&gt;what specific items you’d like to be able to display
---
One nuka quantum filled bathtub plz
---
Yep it was a perk. “Serendipity- while below 30% health gain a 15% chance to avoid damage” must’ve just been extremely lucky 
---
Why would anyone ever listen to me?
---
Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda apologize for this unsatisfactory change to the game that you enjoyed. While it is disheartening to hear that many of your friends have left fallout 76, we intend to refocus on our commitment to bring a multiplayer focused fallout game to the gaming market. We at Bethesda would like to personally recommend the purchase of the Unstoppable! Character costume atomic shop item as a new exciting way of enjoying fallout 76.
---
If your on pc you can add me @ soggyest I’m always looking for friends to play the game with 
---
Yep that’s exactly what it was. Must’ve just been extremely lucky that it happened everytime
---
Just do the missions until you lvl up to get harder ones, Enemies scale with the highest lvl Player in the area
---
So it was just gamingcirclejerk users trying to pull a le epic prank on those evil YouTubers? Yeah, I figured. 
---
Outstanding Todd. It really does just work. 
---
Flatwoods Red Rocket has one under the counter, and the house porch with Miguel's survivor holotape in a footlocker on a small table, Tyler County Fairgrounds has one in the Halloween metal shack in a wicker basket, Camp McClintock has two I've seen: one on the first welcome counter and another behind it near the Overseer's cache on the right. I found these locations by checking for threads today.
---
Wait, did you admit Nuka-Cola are rare?
---
Everybody in prison is innocent.
---
remove the savemystuff mod
---
Love this post. This false "i got banned for cradting 20 guns" nonsense, could not be left unchecked.
---
Lvl 91, still grinding away to get all the perks I'd like and trying to optimize my melee build.  I started after the OP TSE craze so I was kind of forced into melee around lvl. 25.  I'm glad I was, but I had to catch up on the perks and picked a lot of useless ones at early levels.  There are probably 20 or so more I want to have the option to use as I get used to swapping them out.  
---
It's tough sometimes to find things to do, I've just been exploring places I sort of skipped over when I found them and waiting for events.  
---
Endgame for me long term is being able craft mutation serums.  I don't really build but all plans would be tough as well.
---
And a jetpack!
---
Fucking burn that memory right out of your brain a fucking spelling error made the aliens stupid 
---
The uneveness of the neon letters irritates the hell out of me because I could never get them to rest flat. How many serum recipes have you collected so far?
---
The .50 cal machine gun only has the option for either the standard or the Prime receiver, and for some reason you can't make the standard receiver if the Prime one is installed.
---
I believe it's an account wide total otherwise it should be mods. Show health and save our stuff broke the game for me.
---
Any mod that swaps in a different trade menu.swf will break the trading feature. I cleared out my alt only to find it was that mod 
---
No offense to any and all dads here, but you should try and play a known proven game with your kids. Nintendo games almost always work with no fussing.
---
I bet you anything they were trolls from r/Fallout flooding in to cause trouble. 
---
Can’t tell sarcasm or serious.
---
this My heavy gunner deals more damage with a fire axe than with a TSE gatling gun..........
---
yep i have no melee skills at all and I do more damage now with my combat knife than when I use my fully Modded TSE Gauss with all rifleman, Tank killer, demo expert and bloody mess.
---
Stealth is broken and crit build were nerf'd.  All builds CAN work if you throw enoght stims and have endless ammo and great armor, but to have a decent kill rate now you need a melee build.
---
I hesitate because I have a 1 STR rifleman build and by the time I respec into a melee build and get it done right the next patch will likely Nerf the F out of Melee.
---
Ha! Called it. So glad they posted this.
---
Go eeeeaaaast! Life is less peaceful there!
---
First post? Well done, I couldn't agree with you more.
---
Every time the community accuses Bethesda of some dumb shit, I laugh my ass off. Never once thought it was true.
---
It did die. Yeah lets balance PvP but ruin PvE. GJ *claps. Why couldn't they just apply the nerf to only players. Why the whole game. I love being overpowered and just kicking ass etc. Now my shotgun went from mid 800s to low 300s. I might as well throw rocks at the mobs now while dropping all my ammo on the ground. Happened on Division too just not so soon. 
---
On another note. Open Beta for Anthem all weekend. Guys should try it out, I think its pretty fun.
---
There is NO META NIGGA
---
Dude you really riled up Todd Howard's little posse. Their gonna talk so much smack about you between sucking him off.
---
I've got 6 keycards and zero plans to use them at this point
---
I agree i played ESO when it first came out it was a buggy mess hell people were saying it killed the elder scroll franchise and to the people saying you don't get a choice in 76 you don't really get choices in eso but fallout 76 as i see it is a way to push the creation engine to its max to push it so far beyond its point it breaks feeding them data on how to improve it and such 
---
Are you sure it's a lady? Don't want to offend the wrong crowd. I'm sure however I offended said crowd by that statement. 
---
Oooooooooo....ok calm down.....I will hang out here til next patch...that will decide if I stay or go. Damn it I was so hoping to make F76 my forever game.  I stayed with SWG from beginning to end with only a few breaks and was really eager to do the same here.
---
You're off by a factor of 10 there.  They said people with as little as 150K were banned.
---
I play in pacifist most of the time. But I do chase a bounty every now and then. I stay away from pre-claimed workshops because I always seem to get a bounty for shooting a turret that is already shooting me.  
---
The tldr or it is that something is wrong but i can't put my finger on it. At times i am getting the caution/danger bug and there is no mobs in sight. But i can also walk into an area and steamroller everything with consecutive sneak attacks.
---
I managed to land about 6 or 7 consecutive sneak hits on a lv 80 scorchbeast earlier on. Usually i land 1 and that's me spotted. Weird thing is, it was spamming it's sonic attack in my direction but sneaks were still hitting. I was sort of hidden from it at the time so i'd say 'sneak' was working perfectly... 
---
I want to see brightly glowing flies above it.  That would be thematic and make it much easier to find.
---
I get it all the tine, without even having it equipped
---
Same here
---
Unreasonably fucking praise themselves .
---
Explosive Bait and/or Enforcer perk with random weak shotgun.
---
Still better than scrapping mods any day. I’m sure they’ll fix it. 
---
Welp. Literally got them 30 minutes ago that way dude. You may just be very unlucky landing in servers were someone already snatched them
---
If you bought it in October no one will refund you most places haveva 30 day no refund policy
---
I'd agree that you don't return them to what they were, but what they are is an inexcusable abomination. I mean if my maths are correct they took 75% of my damage away and I can now do more damage with melee weapons that have zero perks allocated to them. I could also use a stock Brotherhood Recon Rifle and only lose 3 damage per shot on my particular build. Kind of makes no sense that a run of the mill rifle is on par with a two star legendary.
---
BTW, I blame noone, I blame Bethesda wanting to make the game more of a grind due to lack of content.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHSHAHAH
---
Touché
---
TS MIRV Fatman.  Fireprook perk maxed and Dense armor.
---
Place a Camp somewhere everyone hates like at the Golf club in WS and wait. In time players attack the CAMP go WANTED then run up and shoot them in the feet point blank. You will take no damage and 1 shot them.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
thx beth
---
Oh god is the front page gonna be filled with this shit now? All out of unsubstantiated rumors to be outraged about I guess. 
---
"i have passed this information on to the devs''
---
I have a Post-Lv.60 Gunslinger alt and he is indeed bad and does indeed feel bad.
---
A true fan wants to critique the game so its good, a wannabe fan wants to pretend the game is good. This subreddit is filled with wannabe, blind, moronic fans.
---
You should probably be as worried as all those people convinced they’d be banned for crafting costumes and ammo. 
---
I think you need to re-read the post too, they explicitly stated that people over a certain number of rare items got banned. Then they mentioned that some people under their usual threshold also got banned because of user reports about a suspicious number of items or suspicious activity. 
---
Basically they have an automated system to catch the most egregious exploiters, but that we, as a player base, shouldn't hesitate to report any suspicious activity and Bethesda will investigate further to see if a ban is warranted or not.

Oh don't call them minor remember reddit is the end all be all of all games it's just this 500 or so people playing this game.
---
Trolls belong in Skyrim...
---
No wait that’s only for the Nords 😂
---
Defo wasn’t sarcasm and I built my perks around it - character is only at level 78, I ain’t a lev 200 powerhouse - just someone who now has to restart the whole freaking game as it’s faster to level up to 50 again than to battle through to switch perk points - totally gubbed by it.
---
I actually saved up because of all these posts and mass produced as many things as i could including tons of 5mm ammo. Nothing happened so i assumed it wad all bs like i though.
---
Then this. I love it. Gg no rm
---
Yeah be on tomorrow some time around 6~pm EST
---
It's become a lose-lose proposition for players as a whole. The continuous game of whack-a-mole were playing is quickly getting tiresome. If this will be the norm going forward I'd like to see a point reset with patch releases or even a respec in the atom shop. That's the only thing I'd spend my money on in that thing..
---
Care to tell us when Bethesda lied about Fallout76?
---
You are Just a hater Who does not even know what Is happening, i Hope u or use Friends got this issue too, so maybe u Will learn to shit up and try to hear peoples instead of saying bullshit that u do not even know.
---
Add a flamer and then repair it to 200%.
---
But but what about being able to turn all the scorch beasts into MLP characters that turn their sonic bladt into friend ship is magic and their toxic clouds into a rainbow. (Dear god the hell fire that would be)
---
Have you looked down the back of the sofa?
---
What do you mean "lost"?
---
Big thumbs up for the comprehensive pistol rundown, especially as you presented it so constructively. 
---
My 2 cents adding to it: there’s an even more forgotten corner of pistols, which is auto-pistols. 
---
Rocking a commando as main myself, I really love being able to deploy a full magazine accurately on target, tuning all rounds into a single very painful strike. Given how enemy DR works, the per round damage still needs to be high enough that enemy DR doesn’t eat most of it. 
---
The range of automatic pistols is really, really poor.. and that’s definitely something we could use more of. 10mm, pipe and modular energy ones. That’s about it. 
---
I can make a full set of light or heavy combat. Sturdy I can only make the legs. I’ve got some military fatigues (under armor variant). I’ll even throw in a combat helmet. Mods are an option as well! PM me if you’re interested, I may be on tomorrow morning PST

Instigating Death Tambo weighs .2 lbs does 191 base damage.  Double if at full health.  40% faster swing speed.  Troubleshooters Meat Hook 266 base.  Suppressors Ski Sword 40% swing speed and power attack, 211 base.  
---
Sneaking, glowing meat steaks, well fed/rested, etc. boost them highter most of the time.
---
Yes, Melee is OP but it's risky.
---
I made a post about this here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/ad36u0/fo76\_isnt\_just\_buggy\_its\_also\_untested\_they\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/ad36u0/fo76_isnt_just_buggy_its_also_untested_they_have/)
---
That one is messed up.. But at least you get some loot outta it
---
Never duped, never stored more than 800 punds between me and the stache, so Bethesda Is lying too or does not even know what are they doing, i know peoples and the ones Who duped and still got their account even if with over 500.000 weight, so shut up and think about what u say
---
And what of legendary weapons sold. I unloaded some 1* stuff at Charleston FD, and it just kind of disappeared into the ether. It wasn't immediately viewable in the vendors inventory. I didn't really give it any consideration at the time, and I didn't wait to see if it would take a beat to load in. I've bought legendaries from vendors, so I know they can be resold, but Idk what happened there. 
---
Right they should be chained to their desks and forced to work on fallout 76 24/7.
---
And if there are.. uh.. 2 enemies?
---
you mean the origional intend was to only have melee builds viable?
---
The problem is, I don't think anyone knows. That's kind of the problem.
---
2-3 months ago this place used to be the developers safe space. 
---
An echo chamber of ''this game is fine, haters are just entilted whiny bitches''
---
But now,,,,,
---
Well you know this game is trash when even the apologists and blinkered fanboys have either stopped playing or grew tired of the devs pure incompetence.
---
What’re the untouched rolls
---
20 hours from the first time you interacted with them. Note, the timer is per vendor faction, and there are seven total each with their own 200 cap pool per 20 hour period: Responders, Raiders, Whitesprings, Enclave, Free States, BoS, and Watoga/Grahm.

If you did the mayor for a day quest in Watoga the bots leave you alone unless you hurt them.

Yeah. No porn-star perk. Cannibalism doesn’t confer a damage bonus, nor is there a secret society of well dressed cannibals in tuxedos.

Rather sad that this is what AAA games have come to, where you can't even get your kids into new games because they take months or years to get working to launch quality. 
---
Huh. I thought I was stupid and had used a bunch of radaway  while I didn't have starched genes enabled.

So most of my mutations did disappear on their own.

Even better, spoof 'To Catch a Predator'. Seriously though, I would watch the hell out of either of those.

Write a post on the sub saying you're quitting for good and uninstall the game seems to be meta for these folks nowadays.
---
I mean hitting someone in the head with a giant hammer or axe while wearing a suit of armor that literally gives you super strength kind of makes sense 
---
Are you seeing the scrapped materials, or whole items? 
---
For instance, if you scrap a bottle, the bench menu becomes empty but there will be glass in your pip boy inventory. You can’t scrap raw mats from the bench so it ignores them. The raw mats are sometimes not clearly labeled as raw, which is confusing. 
---
Enclave command vendor. You'll have to be pretty far along in the Enclave quest line to access. I can buy one and sell it to you if you don't have access.

I have 200 rounds of 308 PMC Bronze 147 grain. Out of box though. I put all those rounds in magazines but my rifle didn't like them. 100 dollars.

Mutations won’t stick. I was killing ghouls at Whitespring Resort and mutations would go in and out. Didn’t take any chems or anything. Kept checking my effects page and they were active.
---
Also, it says I’m overencumbered when I’m not. I actively stay underencumbered (?) so I can sprint. 
---
Post, then smoke. Post...and then smoke. :)
---
Uhh maybe the freedom of speech part? Expressing one's opinion, even in an online forum, is still freedom of speech. They don't have to agree with it, but deleting it makes them look like a bunch of fuckwads.
---
I would say the lightest... *Exceeeeept*... The dozens of absolutely grievous and often depressing suicide scenes.  
---
The recon tower with the couple where a skeleton in a suit has a knife in one skeletal hand and a gun in the other with a skeleton in a dress on his lap. Next to the dress skeletons neck there was a blood splatter, and another above the suit skeletons skull.  
---
That’s one of the lighter scenes.  
---
They’ve had some pretty bleak murder / suicide scenes in the previous games, but these ones get absolutely creative and dark. 
---
But enemy DR doesn’t scale, whereas your DPH does. 
---
Stack bloodied and a rad build properly, and your gatling’s doing 500, a minigun does about 100, they all penetrate darn near everything and you can start experimenting with different weapon styles. 
---
It's sad they had to make this statement but i saw like 5 videos of players being banned on YouTube at this point i enjoy watching reddit troll the YouTube news people 
---
Too bad they can't even fix the game without breaking it. They should abandon the game, and abandon game development. They don't have the talent.
---
Now address the rest of your fuck ups this week and do something about it.
---
For clarification the video starts where my somewhat strange spawn-in point is.
---
No, the FO4 recipe uses generic glass.
---
I have a habit of mass spam crafting food faster than game latency can track (cuz it's slow AF moving those numbers) so the whole thing worried be as an innocent smol lad.

At which point it nonchalantly follows you the whole time saying loudly "I just want to go this way...no reason.  No I am not following you despite my ai not seeing you.

Under the map. People are doing it to troll bounty hunters.
---
No its a rare wepon the chances of getting those exact perks are slim so it should have 6× damage your just salty you never got one. Also the people who had those grinded there ass of just to get a good build an explosive wepon on its own does like 230 damage that's fine because it a LEGENDARY WEPON.
---
I love the little cove with all your benches under there, where is this lol I wanna steal the spot haha

This is in a cave on the map... very much not below the map

Since when was Bethesda the U.S. Congress?
---
This is elementary constitutional law, I can't understand how anybody doesn't know this.  The First Amendment protects citizens against the government.  Bethesda is *not* the government.
---
Just level up and buy lvl 1 demolition expert. 
---
lvl 326 here. I never seen anything but pipes and leather armor
---
They can't they are just upset that they missed the duping ban wagon 
---
You have to back out of and then go back into the trade for stuff to show up. It's dumb.
---
You have some problem with bald women?
---
I’m just confused how these idiots on this page can downvote and tolerate a game like 76.
---
It’s mind boggling really. Releasing a broken game. I don’t know man.
---
The Anthem demo is fun. I think Fallout will be my forever-game after some content updates for sure.
---
Never underestimate the power of the basement beard. 500k items in 30 days is a casual grind for them.
---
There's a wonderful satire making fun of randomised loot boxes at Watoga High School
---
Let me help. Bethesda carelessly shrinking their already relatively small 76 player base for no reason, or exploiters that just lost revenue retaliating by smearing the game...Which one makes more sense?
---
New Vegas had some pretty non-con stuff. I'm looking at you, Vault 11. 
---
You're right, but trying to stifle one's opinion because you don't like it? Major dick move.
---
but they were.
---
I thought so. They screwed up the whole water thing.
---
It feels  like the game started with purified water needs bottles, but some game design committee dumbed it down and made it more complicated with this nonsense "boiled water" vs "purified water" which is the same fucking thing if you live  on Planet Earth and obey the laws of physics.
---
Cant wait for all fanboys who defends this game against all nerfs and everything reaction when they introduce so called lunchboxes thats gonna be p2w in your opinion 
---
That's where I am on ps4, but I'm built all up in the tower. Love it!
---
It's still in my stats but the jump doesn't work
---
Yup seemed to work
---
I often wondered about this. My connection is super, the house I just bought had no internet a year ago as it's out in the countryside and got 1000mb fibre just before I moved in. On  top of that I've always kept a high spec pc going. I suffer far less crashes than reported here by some folks. 
---
Just how much a difference a good pc makes would be an interesting poll.
---
Neither of them are involved in supporting F76.
---
Man, I really wish we could go back to fallout 2 days.  I mean, its okay now and Ill play it because I like the world, but even that isn't the same.  Its just been downhill from there. 3 was decent, new vegas about the same, 4 was worse, and now this.
---
Additional deep dive idea, could you please talk about the AI? Especially how different enemies fight each other, and how they work in groups. The AI in this game is terrific, terrible when you're alone &amp; out of bullets, but very well developed. Be nice to peek behind the scenes. Thanks :)
---
GT ThreeBicycle976  .  I've seen your posts for the past few days.  I want some serums as backups.  I'll try to hit you up tomorrow.
---
Yeah, the game isn’t very consistent how it deals with water, but they are different, in the real world too: boiled water has killed off bacteria and organisms, and purified is filtered to remove contaminates.
---
So in-game, it’s:
---
Dirty - Rads and Disease      
---
Boiled - Rads and No Disease     
---
Purified - No Rads and No Disease
---
That's why it's called PR people are to use to independent developers getting on Twitter and talking to them developers develope games look at what happened when that guild wars two developer got on Twitter and started calling the fan base trolls and idiots for trying to tell her how to do her job she got fired most developers who work on games like this pour their heart and soul into the game so when it gets attacked they want to fight back that's why a pr person is there because they are invested in the game they are invested in keeping the people happy 
---
I say no
---
good catch
---
Broken mechanics seem to set unrealistic performance expectations for some people. When said mechanics are fixed, they compare everything else to that and see they can't get the same bang for their buck (or in this case buck for their bang) they used to.
---
IMHO: If you find yourself server hopping (event farming, nuke zone respawning, cap stash farming) for any reason other than getting on the same server as a friend, something is wrong with the game mechanics and needs to be fixed. Expect any such method of gameplay to change at some point. I'm fairly certain server hopping is not an intended as a game mechanic, so any activity involving it as a way of changing the game state is in some form an exploit.
---
Thank you. I have a reddit account birthday? Sweet.
---
I hope you are joking
---
1.4 million copies sold... At a MINIMUM of 40 bucks a pop....this subreddit is close to 10% of that total and statistically 50% of that will spend three times that on cosmetic items alone within the first year....yeah they aren't going anywhere.
---
OP's post and your reply took me from "Hell yeah!" to sad trombone really quickly.
---
I just want to quickly breeze through my inventory, and maybe swap perk cards efficiently with an app while walking in a straight line on Xbox One. 
---
I have recently been perma chameleon on several occasions, even after standing or sprinting or crouch walking. My only bit of chameleon perk is on a legendary combat chest piece. This has only occurred since the latest patch. Gotta reset the game for it to stop. Xbox One X. 
---
Dude this is the buildable cave by the ammo factory and Bailey's cabin.
---
You just made my night, thank you &lt;3
---
yes but thats such a clunky gameplay
---
id rather just play some cod until they fix it to be honest (im aware you can server hop and farm that quest or the grafton monster, but its really no fun with that much loading screens)
---
They meant to say  "seems like a classy skelly". The word lady was just a mistake.
---
Believe me it could be penetrated fairly easily
---
they really dont feel rewarding tho.
---
You get so little caps its not really worth doing the events for that
---
Thank you so much for this. People who defended your decisions were getting flack online. I’m glad you clarified the bans because people would qualify their statements with “just being friends” with cheaters. You are trying to make the game better and the community appreciates it.
---
This. And all the trolls from the past, present and future will be there, 50000 people trashing the community managers and BGS.   
---
So definitely can't be livestream. Can't be reddit for the same reason. Maybe a platform where you submit a question and no one sees it, but only is published when it gets replied to. That way you can filter out bullshit and actually answer questions.
---
Fair enough, you make a good point, don't  mind admitting if I'm wrong. But not being able to use Purified water in recipes that call for  Boiled water is basically insanity. They ARE  the same thing chemically.
---
That's why you run melee/rifleman 😉
---
are we back to blindly defending the game? that was fast.
---
believe what you will, but I play every day, most of the day. been like this since release. mostly hoping servers, so I got a pretty good idea of what they look like. and I've been noticing drops in the playerbase for a while now.
---
January 1st was the first, big one. which I thought was weird being a holiday and all. but I guess it was because of the y2k bug. then a couple weeks later, another drop. looks like it's been bleeding players since then, with past weekend being the worst count so far.
---
this week I could barely find active Uranium Fevers as I was being rotated through the same 3 worlds.
---
It's honestly a beautiful spot but my camp is there as well and someone else has a camp in my spot maybe 30% of the time loading in. Super annoying
---
i dont mind if it takes a little bit.
---
But having artifically prolonged it from a few days to a few WEEKS, seems to long and not fun at all.
---
I wont be grinding the 20k caps because there isnt a fun way to do so.
---
I could server hop and kill the same monster over and over again.
---
But i would rather just play another game to be honest.
---
A video is good
---
I worry it might get distracting if too much lyrical music ends up in the classical channel, as it'll complete with holotapes &amp;c. Maybe an Opera station? I vote Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves from Verdi's Nabucco

Well, you're here.

I'll believe that you aren't "unfairly deactivating" accounts **when the number of lies** from your studio goes down to less than 1 per month.
---
I love the game. And I'm serious
---
Yeah, inability to have alternate ingredients in recipes is a game engine limitation that’s been around since the beginning. Without the ability to substitute, you’re left having to create two separate recipes which makes the crafting UI cluttered with apparent duplicates.
---
A lot of FO3/NV/4 mods address this by letting you “dirty up” purified water by adding nuclear waste etc.
---
How's he gonna get this message?
---
TYPE LOUDER. 
---
No it isn't. DM me. 
---
Sure but I don't think a kid is exploring the game for environmental story telling, they just see a skeleton and want to blow stuff up.
---
I'm not recommending people get kids to play Fallout 76. But it's the easiest Fallout game to do it with. Bring them along to shoot up a town of super mutants, help a silly robot and then build a camp.
---
What's annoying you? You didn't specify why lo
---
Me too...seriously. if the would not do all inn their power to destroy what could be 1 of the best games i ever played( love games) like this
---
I agree with you. I've just now started a character two days ago. I learned the Leather Armor Plans. I then proceeded to make 50-100 pairs of Leather Left Leg armors just so I could destroy each one. My character is now level 10 &amp; knows all the mods for Leather Armor. Next up will be Metal Armor and I highly doubt Beth will be ban me for doing what the game actually wants me to do.
---
Lol this is where we differ. I have no problems at all
---
nope. just today there was someone ranting they were banned for crafting hundreds of costumes and selling them to vendors. they said they did nothing wrong and the ban happened a few hours after the "mass" crafting.
---
there was another post a few days back. Bethesda apparently didn't even bother replying within the time frame they set themselves.
---
crafting will get you banned.
---
Respect that you're willing to put your account on the line to prove this, but the problem with your experiment is you're doing it *after* the complaints have been made public. Without any transparency on Bethesda's part, there's no understanding of what exactly triggers this supposed auto-ban or if they've suspended the banning system as part of an internal investigation.
---
That being said, one immediate problem with your experiment is you're making the assumption the supposed auto-ban system *only* looks at raw numbers, not item type *and* numbers. In order to properly recreate the circumstances of the people complaining, you have to craft the same items they did in the same quantity and time (that being said, if you are trying to recreate a specific claim, my apologies, but please link the post so we can see that's what you were doing).
---
As it stands, I feel like you've really only wasted your time and materials.
---
You know Bethesda responded right https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
It depends lot how you play ofc. I hate when nerfs start. They never stop. 
---
T-bagging is a little childish unless the person you kills annoying lol but it is fun. Currently have a 20 cap bounty for now because I spent all my money on serums
---
I hate when your pacifist, And a guy pulls up strapped with a TSE pump and fucking one shots you.
---
They just made it clear in this post that their bam waves really only apply to abnormal levels of inventory. They never said if you're playing "wrongly," you'll get banned. In fact,  they say exactly the opposite when they mention junk collectors and aspiring vendors. 
---
But yes, if you find yourself with 15 TSE shotguns all with the exact same stats, or 5,000 lockpicking bobble heads then you likely *are* playing the game wrong because you're fucking cheating.
---
I wanted Craftammo 76. I saw the trailer and I thought, “I want to craft some ammo right now.” However, I remembered you can’t do that in Fallout 4. 
---
TSE deserved a nerf people got spoiled by it's power that they forgot how to play the game before it
---
(game freezes)
---
Me: WHO'S MAKING SOUP?!

I don't see why not
---
I'm inclined to agree. But I worry for all the folks who went vigilanty-mode in their frustration xD
---
I just switched back to melee , easily over 1400dmg swing with a gauntlet
---
huh. did not see that. hope it's true considering I've been reported multiple times for "duping" (not taking damage)
---
Pvp aspect i dont give a shit about. Killed 1 player in the game in 223 levels. He begged me to take away his bounty lol
---
I get an over encumbered message everytime I load in since this last patch, even though I'm below max carry. I have too also noticed that when I transfer items I to my stash, personal weight won't change until I back out of the menu. 
---
There are some weapon types/effects that are just way too strong in PVP - mostly unarmed (as I've been somehow almost one-shot by one) and melee (I'm a two-handed build myself, and being able to one or two shot another player is just too strong. Not that I've gotten into to too many PVP fights anyway.). Additionally, I'm fairly certain that two-shot and explosive on a gun is a bit too much still - if I remember correctly it's a 45% total damage increase?
---
And while I'm on the subject, we REALLY need a limit on the number of caps that can be taken upon death in PVP. I feel sorry for any level 100+ out there, because 100 caps per death is an immediate turn-off to almost all high level players doing PVP.
---
This community is full of kiss asses. One person complains everyone does. Bethesda fixes. Bethesda cleared. This community has more problems than 76

Todd Howard here, you have encountered a new game play feature we have implemented in our new patch.
---
We here at Bethesda notice an alarming trend in player retention, in order to correct this trend we have implemented a soft cap to the player count on various servers. we hope you enjoy this new feature as well as our commitment to player satisfaction.
---
I fought these people 2 on 2 for an hour. They went bankrupt 5 times lol. But it was fun we died our fair amount and they died alot but at least they didn't go to Reddit and complain like most do
---
Yeah so would shooting a .50 caliber explosive armor piercing round or melting someones face with a laser reaching the temperature of the sun. All three need to be equally balanced do you won't feel forced into a viable playstile

Someone posted a very good link to mining ammo on here and on YouTube. I did it and made about 2000 rounds for my minigun in about ten minutes. Mining and the excavator PA are your friend. Use it and never have ammo issues again
---
Same here, only has happened to me since the latest patch. 
---
I find myself sitting for a good thirty seconds helps. 
---
Watching the trees move in the breeze after a fresh server connect is actually kinda nice. 
---
Maybe just consoles? My steam is always getting free remaster entries added
---
No idea. I scrounged up one set pre patch sold em for caps as a bundle still need legs for my own set. They disapeaered from vendors. Is there a helmet mod also?
---
I will be patiently awaiting a full story time built around a three paragraph endeavor!
---
Yeah,, you can only tame creatures that spawn on their own at a random spawn location.

Right, so the gamebreaking bug you referred to earlier is/was actually you using a mod, something that Bethesda has said is unsupported and *may lead to instability* (such as game crashes). Maybe edit your earlier post to reflect that the bug was with the mod you were using not being updated rather than with the game itself? (There are plenty of bugs in/with the game, but the hate train is strong enough that it doesn't need additional red herrings thrown in.)
---
As much flak Bethesda deserves, they didnt deserve this. Anyone who has played online games with exploiters should have seen this coming. It's just idiot dupers bullshitting. 
---
ok..thnx
---
So, it would appear since the patch, this doesn't work very well. Protections and assaultrons and gutsys do not self destruct. 
---
As a matter of fact, I had 5 gutsys on fire and they just ran around shooting us. No eyes, no armor...had to kill each one
---
Total for the night...650 rounds of shotgun ammo, 450 rounds of 308, three rocket sledges including all rise and 25 stimpacks. I even switched up and reset my cards for melee. Never made it through the control room...17 bits and I was out of everything and I'm level 77. 
---
Figured that was it. I can only post every 10 minutes in many places. 
---
Want to know the sad thing? It's not a glitch. It's timed. You have to beat the queen within a 20 or 30 minute time limit. I don't know why. But I suspect it has to do with not having the queen flying around on the map indefinitely.
---
Eh. This game would be T rated if it wasn’t for the gore (which compared to other fallouts is soooo tame....only because of technical limitations. I’m a console pleb come at me)
---
Just a friendly reminder that bulking for weight reduction is only applicable to aluminum and lead. 
---
Just you, it's a limit on each client. I also spam e and space when crafting 100-200 stimpacks, heck I might even try and macro it. No issues so far. 
---
Lol whoever told you that is quite stupid. Your house CAN get nuked and destroyed, but spawning your house isn't going to destroy it. The solution to prevent it is to just server hop
---
I wish they had more for ultracite pa
---
Yep. I was just about to write that. As a sniper who couldn't care less about Power Armor it's not something I care to even keep in my stash. I've even offered a full set of T-60 (idk if that's a good set or not) to my clan leader. The Str is nice, but not needed.
---
Just found d a TS Fat Man and it's weighing me down but I feel like somebody really wants it so I feel bad dropping it, lemme know Xbox One brennanbilinski down to give it away if anyone thinks it's valuable to them
---
For all we know, they think it's in the game currently and working fine :(
---
No I think what you asking about is the budget for when you're building in your camp, correct? If so, the gray bar to the right in budget is all the items you have built previously in your camp, but then stored for later use, rather than scrapped. 
---
Bethesda ruined the Fallout community and franchise with 76. Thank you Bethesda.
---
Plus, the Excavator looks like a dump truck/school bus/bumblebee(Transformers). I think it should get the extra weight nod. All the other Power Armors can have the ability of looking awesome.
---
Wish they had nore, period!
---
Isn’t the reason it’s set to that is because fo4 and Its precursors had max 10 for the special stats? Now that 15 is the new max, shouldnt the power armor be reset too?
---
Did you enjoy your rant?
---
I like reading why ppl quit. I see its not only me that is pissed at nerfs been &amp; nerfs to come and all bugs &amp; glitches
---
I can't log in ATM. Plus last night my game glitched after I stuffed some gear in a locker due to being overloaded, then when I came back the locker was gone. Wtf
---
But im not quitting yet
---
Todd sure made himself visible in the lead up, to not even make another appearance given the mass amount of controversies since release is not a good look at all for the public face of the company. 
---
BGS doesn’t care that the game is bad. They got your money lmfao. They put minimal effort into all their updates and social media responses and nothing has gotten better. They’ve been the exact opposite of transparent when it comes to acknowledging and fixing issues. All we can do is stop playing and show them that their product is unacceptable 
---
Damn! I'm just a transdemensional astro-creep. In my past life I was a orc warrior tank. I lack the eyesight or know-how to finagle with a skeleton's reproductive parts.
---
I agree, but I feel that a kid would typically miss a lot of those.
---
Equivalent to someone explaining why they quit, right ? Right?
---
No,he's right. I've actully spawned into my camp half a second before a nuke hit it. It was on a pretty lake east of the top of the world. You know the one, where no one drops a nuke? They just missed the train vendor, but me and my nice nest? YOU HAVE BEEN KILLED BY DEATH!
---
I'm not lying. My camp duplicated. My account is normal other than the stash showing weight of around 800. 
---
Where is the leniency you promised when you deicde to take action after remaining  silent leaving players to do as they wish. When I got banned the only things on my account in large bumbers were less than 100 nuka grape I'd just been given from a friend.  When you said you would show leniency me and loads of friends dropped several tse guns and aid items we had all being trading for weeks. 
---
I see no in game message suggesting if you find anyting excessive do not collect or you risk being banned.  I know one friend who found thousands  bobbleheads in a cabinet. Another found 400 tse harpoon guns. We all shared all this for weeks and weeks and didn't dupe anything but your statement  reads otherwise. If someone has large amounts they must have cheated just isn't true.  
---
I find it amazing you can respond to these questions but failed at launch to answer anything. 
---
 My camp did glitch my stash and I'd hoped this was enough for someone to see and put right. No proof can be shown of my account having half  a million items it just isn't true so public shame me, throw anyone with a dispute under the bus and call me a liar again. Anything to avoid a load of you tubers slagging you off. 
---
You were an Orc warrior in a past life hot damn I was a Space Marine this must be fate someone start writing our erotic fan fiction ahits about to get weird. Lmfao I feel as if I could keep thia going but fear what that entails.
---
Thank you for this post. The games in a weird state but we gotta stay with the facts and dont spread lies. 
---
My copy of fo76 is on an actual disk.
---
I love how the Vault Boy's pointing like "Get a load of this guy" 
---
Like you, I’m an adult who doesn’t get to spend a lot of time on this thing. So when I start to devote 1 - 2 hours on a daily quest and then the server kicks me out and everything is lost ... cool. So glad for the progress. 
---
BS
---
Were the guys in the duping group on xbox live yesterday banned? What about all the item's still going live on eBay? 
---
You've lost your good will Bethesda, you told us the last few patches fixed this that and the other and they clearly didn't. Were supposed to take your word for it now though and believe you again? Let me guess, want me to throw in a PRE ORDER for rage 2?
---
There are a few places to get a chainsaw (Ranger station in Cranberry Bog, Pleasant Valley Ski Resort, etc.), and it spawns at level 20.
---
coordinated propaganda....this isn't an election or a coup.
---
Buff the alien blaster
---
"something is wrong with the game"
---
Yes. Now lets address the reasons why people are server hopping. And fix those first before pulling the rug out from under people. 
---
The mobs don't respawn on their own in a timely manner. People will use whatever means to get them to spawn, whether it's server hoping at Whitespring, or group forcing respawns, or whatever.
---
People farm events for Legendaries and item plans. That was sometimes one of the only ways to reliably to get them. So yes there is something wrong with the game.
---
Making caps is limited to 200 from 7 vendors.  So a hard limit of 1400 from them per day/20 hours. The cap stash containers now stay empty for days. The way they worked before was perfect. Can I explain it? Everything about it was perfect. From the sound, to the Cap Collector animation, to the possibility of getting 200 or more caps rarely. It was perfectly designed. And now they have ruined it.
---
Just about everyone in this game is exploiting something. They don't even know they're exploiting. So yes there is something wrong. And it's not the players fault that try to make the best of a bad situation and then have it wrecked because "we didn't intend that". 
---
Who actually cares? Really? Who cares? Who cares if someone is making 5000 caps an hour staring at loading screens and learning cap stash routes? Nobody cares. Except people who want to attempt to manipulate and control them. If they want people to play longer, it's a good idea to not try and make the experience as long and dull as possible for them. 
---
If people are having fun doing what they want to do, then you did a good job with the game. Why ruin it? For what? Who does it serve? Whose principals and design intent is so important that people can't just be left to play and enjoy the game they paid for without having any effect on anyone else? Some people want to grind. Grinding for something nonstop until they get what they want. Artificial barriers and time gates are just frustrating for many and will only make people quit.
---
ditto but with poons
---
The game is crashing/disconnecting eveey few minutes. I ve crashed like 10 times in 1 hour. Anyone else noticed an increase in crashes?
---
Evasive perk?
---
Last I saw it's a free country. This is a rant about people ranting. I'm not sure which is worse.
---
I literally just saw the juicehead video on this because I was bored and finished clone wars. those bastards lied to me!
---
no, they should add that perk for 2 handed melee weapons and not ALL melee weapons. Punching absolutely does not need to be stronger than what it already is.
---
Have you tried "repair all structures?"
---
I'm scared to enter anywhere that will require a loading screen. I've just lost my 4th workshop this morning by being stuck on a loading screen after entering a building. 
---
“What do you hope to accomplish? Bethesda’s attention?” Umm... yeah. If they see what aspects are driving people away, they can fix them. If they don’t, they will have to answer to their stock holders. Sorry reading it upsets you, but try taking your own advice. Nobody cares if you care. If you’re tired of reading those posts, then don’t!
---
There's at least one more for the drill: a piercing drill bit.
---
You see there's a special ability that not a lot of people have in the Reddit. this special ability is known as "patience"
---
Goddamn. It's a fucking game. Have you ever masturbated? You should try masturbation. 👍
---
But that's why it's so damn stupid. If you quit why do you care if they change things you already quit
---
lol... guess you have a point there 😁 seeing ppl selling tse guns for 500c. I just moved mine to a mule until needed again 
---
One thing after another with this bunch of clown shoe wearing dev's :/
---
Seriously couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery :(
---
New Atom store stuff added soon though !!
---
Sing along with me people, bonus down vote for knowing the song.
---
&gt; All I hear is, waaah I can't one-shot,
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Waaah I can't play-now,
---
&gt; Waaah I can't one-shot,
---
&gt; Waaah I can't kill you?
---
&gt; Waaah now what do I do.....?
---
I really would love this to be a change. Especially since profile loadouts aren't a thing and well I find it to be really tedious design in general.
---
They're deleting yours and my comments by the way. Shill subreddit run by shills.
---
Im sure youd get your refund back in monopoly money. Because atleast im bottlecaps your experience would be fun and relivant. 
---
Making the game longer since dlc coming for a while. Just like with nerfs been &amp; to come lol
---
well, here are 3 bug reports of mine:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amcin1/bug\_repeair\_all\_vs\_individually\_repair\_cost/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amcin1/bug_repeair_all_vs_individually_repair_cost/)
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amc2y9/bug\_gauss\_rifle\_mods\_description\_and\_stats\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amc2y9/bug_gauss_rifle_mods_description_and_stats_are/)
---
and the most important one:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amc149/bug\_tamed\_dead\_animals\_take\_10\_camp\_budget\_each/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amc149/bug_tamed_dead_animals_take_10_camp_budget_each/)
---
But only the first one is heard while crafting, no matter how long one waits between items. The rest all sound after leaving the bench.
---
I would love a log book as well so people that visit my CAMP can tell me how cool it is. Fuck TSE or whatever, give me that sweet sweet validation. 
---
In case anyone wants to know what it really feels like to melee the SBQ https://imgur.com/a/PFR0s1M
---
Haven't played for days so I wouldn't know. But yeah, months of playing the game gets you used to that kind of thing.
---
We're moving from a comedy of errors into an embarrassment of errors. 
---
That's my new group noun for errors, btw.
---
Yes you can get it refunded I’ve bought the aviator fat man skin before on accident and they refunded my atoms. You just need to submit a tick to Bethesda support.
---
I don't know what's worse, how crappy you argument was or the fact you used a free country as an argument. This subreddits more idiotic than I thought
---
Just gonna leave that here. Wanna tell us again how you dindu nuffin?
---
LOL
---
I'm sensing a large amount of salt levels, covered in a crappy excuse you consider an insult, coming from you
---
I can hook you up at that price..  
---
Hi devs! I hope you'll find this useful. I play on PC with an Xbox One controller:
---
*Armor*
---
- Leather armor with the Vault Tec paint is glitched. Sometimes the paint doesn't show up on the armor itself despite me attaching the mod. So far I've only noticed this happening on heavy leather armor arms
---
- Pockets on the leather armor with Vault Tec paint are see through. Speaking as a game artist it looks like the normals have been inverted. Once again this is with heavy leather armor arms. I have not tested if this still happens on light or sturdy leather armor or without the paint.
---
*Weapons*
---
- Gatling laser and plasmas have a glitch with the ammo. Whenever I switch to the gun the ammo left in the core is equivalent to the total cores I have (eg. if I have two cores, it only has two shots, if I have three it only has three shots, etc.) This is consistent regardless if I select the weapon with the D-Pad, the favorite wheel, or the pip-boy. Reloading does not appear to deplete any cores and the weapons work as normal otherwise
---
*Camp*
---
- I somehow managed to store more than 600lbs in my stash? This happened after I took the perk that lowers the weight of heavy weapons. I had stuffed my stash to the brim on my previous visit and when I went to it after leveling up, it suddenly had 610lbs. I did not remove nor add anything, however it did lower to 605lbs after crafting a bit.
---
*Power armor*
---
- Sometimes there is no sound when entering power armor
---
Thank you for doing what you do! 
---
Jesus. Give it a rest. Get a life or something
---
do not play this game at the moment unless you want a ban as its literally unplayable in its current state with the bans better to not support this game than being banned do not play
---
Yeah the SBQ shouln't be able to fly out-of-bounds. Surely it's a simple fix. I've had this happen a few times so far and it's stupid.
---
Because games can change especially if a dev sees threads like the ones your complaining about and go oh so that was the problem? lets fix that.
---
If you hate people having opinions so much do everyone a favor and download the epic games launcher designed from the ground up to silence all opinions about games both good and bad.
---
Just as I thought it couldn't get worse, it does. Get a life? That's so basic it's basically learning alphabet basic.
---
Wah! Wah! Wah! That's what you sound like.
---
Are we talking about Fallout or your favorite game to play 
---
We're passing it on to the team...but, taking into account the laundry list of lazy omissions and asinine fuck-ups in the other comments, what makes you think that the team gives a damn?
---
And I thank for feeling the need to tell me. Good on you. 
---
I do have to say recent nerfs and stuff were heavy handed but I'm currently rocking a AA explosive and a Tse western revolver at 208 ish dmg and am really looking forward to maximizing this build curently only running 1 of each 🔫 perk and 3* demo and 3* bloody mess. I would def look into pistols they are a lot more fun imo also they sound sooooo fucking good like they got some umph behind um :)
---
So take one week real time and multiply by bethesdas sense of bug fixing and we have 1.5 years, sounds about right.
---
I only figured it out after wondering why, in the status tab, my little "pip-me" looked sad...then I realized.
---
Complain if you want just don't do it here. Make a subreddit called Fallout 76 issues and complaints so the people who still like the game can use this Reddit without someone trying to convince us that the game is bad.
---
The 50 or so (total) people with me over those 5 events would disagree....
---
How this was not noticed as being needed, in the first few hours of bethesda testing, is just baffling. I don't even bother picking safes or locked containers anymore. 
---
The crafting cards should just activate when you use a bench... camp cards when you are in your camp... and pick lock and hacker be always active. 
---
Speak for yourself. I want clean furniture and clothing that I can mix and match and combine with base-game items to achieve a variety of different effects/looks.
---
And I fucking love my princess bed.
---
Hmm I may try out the pistol build then. My heavy guns has turned into a complete ammo and resource sink and I'm finding rifle melee so dull to play. Those first 50lvs though... Such a slog! 
---
Hmm. Getting off for a week. Straight? I don't know if I have enough lube to get off for a whole week. Do you produce a lot of saliva OP?
---
My friend list bugged and I had to resend you a request!
---
Yup just waiting on my tesla to be fixed other then that I just fell in love with pistols I generally one or two shot things I can only imagine if I mix it up and go vats with it and throw psychopath on and maybe the adrenal mutation don't know if that would effect it basicly ran a max weight build just startes delving to mix it up
---
Agree, but with the nerf I don't think it should cost a second bullet. 
---
Sweet! When are you available? 
---
Todd Howard here, We here at Bethesda noticed an alarming trend in player retention, in order to correct this trend we have implemented a soft cap to the player count on all servers. we hope you enjoy this new feature as well as our commitment to player satisfaction.

that works im on rn. Ill PM you my gamer tag
---
They’re SBQ drops. I doubt you can buy them. 
---
Suuuure... that happened.
---
I dunno. Maybe? Seems dubious in terms of balance, but I'd entertain the idea.
---
And Bethesda never lie to boost sales?
---
Never said a product is ready to be launched when it wasn't?
---
Group of dupers on xbox live last night taking custom orders for a few hundred caps....the duping that was fixed apparently according to the trust worthy and honest corporate face of Bethesda.
---
"Everything is good, everything works, be a good consumer and give us your monies"
---
True. It's like a don't buggy had sex with an ugly forklift.
---
Actually some duping methods came back with this update because it was a accidental roll back but once again it's the official statement of Bethesda and if you read the comments they are positive and everyone figured those lost were lying
---
It is a glitch when she flies out if the player zone during the quest timer. 
---
Pretty sure atom shop will soon have a perk loadout for 2000 atoms 😂 
---
And what about the people who bought those rare items off of looking for group post with caps from other players that you have banned but havent duplicated items?
---
You don't care and have stopped playing... Yet here you still are.
---
Replace your camp and place it from blueprint for no materials
---
Typical reddit, someone makes a post about being innocent and everyone uses it as an excuse to bash something without any due process at all.
---
So stop talking. 
---
Hey don't blame me if your fucking broke-ass writing is so ambiguous I can't figure out which way you stand on a topic. Maybe back off the Drackar Noir and take a night class. 
---
They fixed like three things out of the numerous bugs that we're reintroduced. By fixing one thing they added a new bug. Everything else is still there. It was literally the smallest hotfix ever.
---
Bobby pins weigh 0.01 again
---
Bulk is useable in crafting again(albeit now autoscraps)
---
And they fixed the (known) tag appearing on other characters that do not own the plan.
---
No thanks, I'm saving up for an 8ball of uncut cocaine and a hooker. 
---
That’s what I was saying. Affected, not affects.
---
Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda have always strive for customer satisfaction, knowing that users who have enjoyed the game share the same sentiment we would like to highlight this attitude as the model behavior going forward.  Often times our focus becomes blurred by intangibles such as player retention, customer feedback, and patch stability. Rest assured we intend to concentrate our efforts to what players want most: an expansion of atomic shop items.  
---
I guess that makes sense actually.
---
FINALLY 
---
99.9% of the time that box will be empty. You leave stuff in there one guy will take it all and move on without thinking (or even notacing it was from a human). 
---
Do nthe BoS questline and get them from Taggerdy's terminal.
---
hey I can make all serums, Im on PC Im selling each one at 400 caps if you are interested
---
Sorry to hear that. Never messed with the animal perk card. Hopefully they fix it. 
---
Right. And I want to state for the record that I AM NOT  a passionate defender of Bethesda or this game.  I have spent a great deal of time raging on here about this game myself.  Hell, I've taking a lot of shit from people when I criticized this game, and if anything, I thought this forum was being way too soft on the game because I thought that it had some very serious problems and had launched in an utterly abysmal state.  
---
But the last patch ACTUALLY FIXED many of the things that I was pissed off about. So I found it bizarre  to see people suddenly spewing vitriol in a forum that had once been nothing but fawning praise for a game I thought was deeply troubled.
---
It didn't make any sense, until I started thinking about how the game's balance had been broken, the in-game economy ruined by dupers- and this patch was addressing much of that. 
---
Then it all made sense.
---
I have an half shotgun half melee build with 315 shotgun damage, I miss one perk, and in fact mobs are Not a problem. You have used to play that way but hey playing is not one shot everything. If you have problem with your build improve it or buff you with chems. 
---
White springs shops in the hotel maybe? There’s one at the end where there’s a ton of camp plans 
---
WWWHHHOOOOOOPPPTTTYYY DDDOOO!!!
---
Cool.
---
Tried that, said there was one turret that needed repairing due to the components. Did that and nothing showed up.  Trying to load a new server. Will post update.
---
There are no such things as venders in-game.
---
I’d be fine with either, to be honest. I’m not usually the type to complain on here about the game because I think that happens enough. But this is one thing that’s a little bit of a pet peeve haha 
---
I used most of my caps to buy him out of plans but he didn't have what I was looking for :(
---
Shut. The. Fuck. Up. You. Double. Minded. Retard.
---
Ooh I am sorry. I definitely don’t know for sure then since the update 
---
There's a saying in the d&amp;d community: "No d&amp;d is better than bad d&amp;d". 
---
This game sucks dinosaur balls right now. I'm an AVID fallout lover. I got the game day one, not because I didn't want to preorder but because I could not. I played through glitches, deco, nerfs, all of it. 
---
To finally give up when they announced that the only "content" they were bringing is a fuckin PvP mode. Like, the same that already exists, but without rules. Like, where you can bring your totally stupidly powered character in or out if you just want to grief for twenty minutes.
---
I'll be back when the game is better. But since ladydevann said a few days ago that "she hopes she can soon give us info about when the roadmap will be released", I doubt I'll be back any soon
---
Yeah. Shields. Like in all the other fallout titles.......
---
Oh ny apologies 
---
pathetic that a bug thats been there since the beta is still active...
---
If you want an AMA of the state of FO76, you can just ask me. My ability to answer your questions will be as good or as bad as anyone you find in Bethesda. 
---
I'm always lurking around vault 76 doing junk runs so I see a lot of low levels. I try everytime to get rid of a bunch of plans that I have horded but so far no takers. They are weighing me down and I would rather give them away then just drop them.
---
I'd be more inclined believing Bethesda than some random user who claims "he never did anything wrong".
---
We've seen it when people started spreading fake news about the stealing-from-your-inventory glitch, about the nerf to stealth and in a lot more istances.
---
If you decide to join the conspiracy bandwagon then you should start doubting about any news you read / hear around you.
---
People who got banned, got banned for a reason. You won't get banned for playing the game. This demential and alarming state of mind needs to stop.
---
Skyrims dragons behaved the same way sometimes... oh wait...
---
I assume you will be able to put items in the future coming vending machines for zero caps, so I think this idea is already covered kinda.
---
Yeah, it ate up like 9k but I'm glad I know most everything now.
---
Yeah. And I have a fat pearl necklace to give you.
---
(PS4)  showing a negative reduction on the SPECIAL page but not on the effects page. (It’s an addiction, just not showing up anywhere) 
---
Just checked, and mine has also lost the "During night" section
---
If each vendor had their own separate caps then you'd probably not be able to exhaust all of them within 24 hours before they reset, then there may as well not be a cap limit.
---
You did absolutely dick to the SBQ at lv16. In fact you made it harder for the players who had to carry your dumbass.
---
Well mine still has it. My friends one not... thats so messed up
---
I can say that the Pistol weight reduction perk still works on these combinations as well. I don’t know how to confirm the rifle armor penetration perk. 
---
What else do you want them to do? Personally fix the issue themselves? The fact that they're acknowledging this stuff is good enough.
---
Like I've said on other peoples threads, no one is actually making anyone play this game, move on with your lives, it looks pathetic whining about something online, especially when it's just a video game....
---
I tried to be a traveling vendor, trading with players I ran across.  To be honest, between the crippling storage issues, carry weight problems, players frightened to reveal inventories, and user interface issues.  I became painfully aware that this game was not ready for Players being traders/merchants. 
---
As for player vending machines, yeah that will only work if people can find your camp.  As the system stands now, your camp only shows up on your map, and the maps of your team mates.  The average player can not see your camp on the map, so there is nothing  indicating there could be a source of trade.
---
Yep. As of about two weeks ago. Prepatch. Nope, not a duper. Nope. Didn't use TSE guns. Don't care about nerfing. But a rollback on a patch? Claiming transparency, then slipping in changes for the worse. Still haven't received an email for free older games. Enough is enough. I have every right to be mad, especially since this is well below what we all know they are capable of. Feels like a cash grab.
---
I figured I'd get downvoted and not many would agree with me. But I've put my time in, leveled as high as I want to go. Done everything there is to do. Suffered through bugs and a mismanaged mess of a game since the B.E.T.A. I defended Bethesda so many times.
---
The other posts of singing praises to fixes that just about any other company would have had fixed well before now is tiresome. All the ass kissing is getting old. We owe them nothing.
---
The love / hate pendulum for this game is nauseating and I'm hopping off this ride.
---
I still check this sub bc maybe, just maybe, a company that used to be at the very top of my list can get their shit together. But I'm not spending another dime or minute playing that game.
---
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
---
r/fo4 is over there asshole.
---
...Y2K bug?
---
This is fucking genius

My name is James, and I like trains.

Given the size of her excrement piles, her meat pile should definitely be bigger.

Currently what else than "melee with a rifle in case of scorchbeast" is there?
---
What platform are you on?
---
actually they buy many new accounts and keep doing it. lots of youtube videos of cheaters bragging they do it. saw it rampint when the ban hammer fell on destiny.
---
The community needs to start getting things right....Bethesda fix there game all these issues go away you get that right?
---
Well maybe you are inclined to believe Bethesda / todd howard's PR machine, after going through the same shit on a few of there launches though I for one don't trust a word they say and like to see things for myself.
---
Like the duping group lat night on xbox selling whatever items you wanted for a few hundred caps. Bethesda said it was fixed but it wasn't / isn't.
---
PC , I think the rng gods like to tease me ...
---
at least it wasnt a drill 
---
Never believing is just as bad as always believing. The goal shouldn't be to have a black and white mind set, but to look at the information presented and come to your own conclusions on the honesty of the poster.
---
If all they have is their word that they swear they didn't do anything, it's difficult to know one way or the other, and so some of the very many people saying they were banned for no reason are telling the truth. 
---
With a game with as many bugs as FO76 (not trying to hate, lets just be honest) can anyone say its out of the realm of thought that a bug would create so many copies that it triggers the auto ban?
---
Here's what you do. First, you keep this shit to yourself. No one cares. Second, uninstall fo76, break your disc of fo76. Third, get a fucking life. Fourth, try playing with your genitalia every once and a while. It's good for relieving stress.
---
I've got most of the shitty plans, I'm hoarding junk and chems to sell for caps at vendors every few hours to hoard caps for a Lever Action Rifle plan from Lewisburg, as that seems to be the best for my Rifleman/Two hand build I have going on.  
---
I scan every container for everything now, but I stick to Charleston and the area around the dried up lake for screws, springs and lead.
---
It's like in r/wow. Every now and then a post appears with title "I got banned for X" where X is something benign like dropping a party, sniping on AH or standing on a mailbox. Later a community manager comes and basically says "No, on the same day before, you were racist/abusive in the chat". Basically 90 percent of "Lol I got banned" post are falsified. In Fo76, where there's already the tendency to create fake outrage to damage the game, the number has to be even higher
---
I have posted at least once that I was worried about being a mass crafter. I'll spend a few hours harvesting and then sit at the cooking station making lots of food and drinks. It's how I've gotten the majority of my xp. This makes me feel a little better.
---
It's called high-tec light set. I'm still looking for it, but my friend got it when we defended a claimed workshop over in the cranberry bog area.
---
I once got a furious rolling pin😣😢
---
Good, you cheat you get banned. I don't get how some people are trying to actually justify that.
---
ouch , that's rough . still I mean you could roll up a grandma looking character ;p
---
I like to masturbate.
---
How do you make a the beep-boop thing remind you again?
---
Bunker? Use the other terminals. The first one has been bugged for awhile.
---
And I have every right to be here. Because maybe, just maybe they'll get their shit together. Just bc I'm done with a game that does not meet their usual standard doesn't mean I'm fully over the company. 
---
But the trend is clear. Rereleasing Skyrim over and over. Fallout 4 moving away from what made Fallout great. Fallout 76 moving even further. There are internal issues at Bethesda.
---
I desperately wish it weren't so. Morrowind got me through my dad getting fired and having to move to a new place. Skyrim got me through my grandparents passing away. Fallout 4 got me through moving to a new town and starting a career where I didn't know anyone.
---
It is with a heavy heart I turn my back on Bethesda. They have to earn my trust again. Not you, your snarky comment means nothing to me.
---
Have a good night.
---
It’s a random spawn like the trick or treater, the messenger, the crashes satellite, the manakins, etc. The treasure hunter is just a dead body that you can search for a map. 
---
So, you are telling me you'd rather trust *the internet* over a reliable source of informations, like one of the major AAA gaming industries in the field, because of... reasons?
---
If you wanna go for it, go for it. But then don't come here and start complaining about people that keep finding exploits and abuse them, because I assure you it's the same that come here and be like "BETHESDA BANNED ME FOR BLOWING MY NOSE OMG HURR DURR".
---
Moreover, to reiterate the concept, if you are inclined to believe random conspiracy theories, you should doubt of anything you hear, not only those you want to believe in.
---
I know that the downside to Two Shot weapons is that, since the damage bonus (used to but no longer convincingly) represents an additional projectile being fired, each bullet has its own chance to miss. Taking both projectiles into account for the VATS accuracy estimate seems unfeasible without displaying multiple values, so I imagine that the displayed percentage reflects the chance of hitting the target for each bullet.
---
OTOH, even considering this, routinely missing 2-4 consecutive shots in VATS is an excellent indication that the probability to hit is most likely not 95%, no matters what VATS tries to convince you to swallow.
---
There is also a bug where the timer for the fight ends and the SBQ stays in the area and you can still kill her for the glory and rewards, not sure what caused the bug and this isn't a complaint...I feel having a timer for the fight ruins it to a certain degree, like a false urgency &amp; She should stay in the Area until she meets her demise, not every lobby has higher levels to help casuals/lower leveled players get some glory too even tho they can still drop a nuke on the area at the lower levels they are.
---
 While one SBQ is on the map you should be able to nuke the area to either do a good chunk of damage or possibly mutate her even further for guaranteed explosive weapon drop if you can defeat her, obviously she would be buffed to all hell and it would take some serious firepower to get the Explosive weapon drop, but worth it considering how much Bethesda nerfed the drop rate of them in general. Would make for better end game content and keep more hardcores playing daily for the chance to get the best explosive rolls possible. Bethesda, make this happen.
---
I guess that’s 5 of you who didn’t realize I was being a smart ass. :)
---
A lot of people hate the "humanizing" of corporate entities, and Wendy's Twitter is  a great example of that. 
---
**Strength:**
---
I would imagine  you know of all the carry weight perks. It seems different people have their chosen card layout. I myself don't run any, if I did I would choose to use Thru-Hiker (Agility). I'm a sniper main so I rarely ever need to use meds. I think overall the best perk card for carry weight is **Strong Back (Strength)** because it just adds additional weight and isn't reliant on you holding any certain thing..
---
**Perception:**
---
Butcher's Bounty (Perception) This card can be helpful. I don't use if when there is extra meat I could collect that won't really help me. I do use this card when it comes to the animals like Rad Stags!
---
Green Thumb (Perception) is an excellent card if you're going to be doing a lot of cooking. 
---
Picklock (Perception) cards depend on if you want to bother with lockpicking.
---
**Endurance:**
---
Cannibal (Endurance) is more helpful than a lot of people realize. Yes it's "gross", but it will help you stay fed &amp; replenish your health. 
---
Aquaboy/girl (Endurance) is pointless in my opinion. I always lug around a Hazmat Suit which gives me -1000 Rads. If I ever (which I usually don't) feel the need to swim I just throw it on. I'm 300 hours in and I've barely done any swimming. What little bit I've done was just for fun.
---
**Charisma:**
---
Inspirational (Charisma) is one of the absolute best perks you can run. Starting from the beginning of the game if you use this when teamed up you'll level super fast. Even if you don't have a friend online you can usually send a team request to a random to create a "team". They can still do them, while you do you.
---
Hard Bargain (Charisma) If you EVER want to buy anything from vendors for a price that isn't insanely high. Equip this card each time you buy/sell.
---
Travel Agent (Charisma) People like to put their camps in pretty spots, spots with resources, or near water, etc... A lot of people don't just plant themselves in the middle of the map. If they did this card wouldn't be as useful. The money you save when using this card isn't extreme but it does help regardless.  
---
Squad Maneuvers (Charisma) This simply allows you to move faster. Speed kills.
---
**Intelligence:**
---
There are tons of crafting cards in the Int tree. Take the ones you feel you need.
---
Hacker (Intelligence) cards are just like the Picklock (Perception) cards. Take them if you want to hack.
---
Scrapper (Intelligence) was an excellent card in Fallout 4. It's one of the worst now in 76, You usually get a piece of wood or steel back.
---
Contractor (Intelligence) This is such a nice card if you want to do anything at CAMPs or Workshops
---
Chemist (Intelligence) If you plan on creating a bunch of meds, this is a helpful card. If not don't worry about it. It is only one star. though. So, it's cheap.
---
**Luck:**
---
Pharma-Farm (Luck) I always take Pharma-Farm (Luck) as one of my first three cards. I continue to use it until I feel I have enough meds. Not only are the meds helpful they sell for a lot to vendors. It's a very fast way to start piling up money.
---
Scrounger (Luck) is decent for when you are extremely low on ammo and you have to do something to build back up. The issue I have with it is there are a lot of times where I'd use the card only to be given extra crap ammo I couldn't care less about.
---
Can-Do (Luck) is one of the perks I truly couldn't care less about. If you plant about 10 Razorgrain at your CAMP, then take and use the Green Thumb (Perception) card to go collect all of your Razorgrain you'll end up with 20 at least. Cook the Razorgrain with a Boiled Water and you're total will be 20 pieces of food that gives a buff. That may sound like a lot of tedious work, but I'd rather do that than was a point on a card.  
---
Super Duper (Luck) I know this is technically a crafter card, but it is one of the best there is in the game. It unlocks at level 50. Try to have it maxed 52. It will save you a headache if you plan on creating anything.  
---
\---  
---
I'm extremely tired typing this, but insomnia &amp; vampirism has my by the low jollies. If I made a ton of mistakes in my write up let me know and I'll fix them.
---
We should have the kind of staircases that appear in abandoned houses. 
---
I'm still not convinced. You guys banned my son for cheating. He just started playing and was level 5 or so. We still got no idea what caused you guys to close his account since we got no explanation other than your robo-mail. May be I'm lucky and get some clarification this way.  -&gt; Incident: 190116-000619 
---
Centre one is the only one that works for me
---
No, not because of reasons. Because of Bethesda's track record and what I've seen for myself.
---
And no you assume wrong as I've not been banned and couldn't give a toss if someone blows my camp up lol its pixels.
---
The game needs fixing, its in a worse state than a BETA at the moment and 5 patches haven't changed that, but sure you go right ahead and keep sipping that Bethesda coolaid! Maybe the next patch will fix it....maybe they wont get round to it till patch 27. In the mean time the Atom store has had plenty, of updates.
---
I've got over 900 hours in kid. It's almost a guarantee that I know more about how this game works than the devs do at this point. You're just full of sh!t and angry that you're being called out on it by everyone in this thread.
---
You won't be missed.
---
I had a level 142 come up to me about 2 weeks back. They noticed only had a t-45 head, torso, left arm and right arm, so they threw up the trade emote and i responded with the yes emote, they offered the legs and a power armour station plan for free.
---
Moral of the story-don't assume all fallout players are butthurt 12 year olds who had their game crash once, there are some really kind people out there
---
It's part of the anti-duper restrictions post-patch.  Use the center vendor terminal.  The others have been disabled.
---
Not only adds weight, reduces max durability too.
---
The large magazine is the gift that keeps on giving.
---
Hahahahahahhaha ok 
---
No.  Just no.  Stop trying to force PVP into this game.
---
I can make it
---
Where do you get your royal jelly
---
OP gives good criticism towards a buggy mess of a game in exactly the correct location for it and your response is “how dare someone complain about a video game because it’s just a video game”.
---
Are you actually this stupid?
---
So what? As far as I'm concerned they can take the whole year to fix it, I'm in no rush and I've got other things I can do in the meantime.
---
Who do you and other people have to act like it's a matter of life or death? They are releasing patches, so they are trying. If you believe they can't then move on and go play something else. What's the point of staying and complaining 24/7 only about the bugs they've left behind?
---
We had countless improvements since release, stop spilling lies. This kind of attitude is only aimed at bringing the game down because of self indulged hate towards it. You don't even care anymore if they succeed or not. You are just waiting for them to take a false step to rinse and repeat the same old crap. "OMG THEY SUCK" "OMG DUPING". If people want to exploit, that makes them stupid, not Bethesda.
---

What system are you on
---
Demand in one hand, shit in the other. See which hands fills first.
---
Or plan of a legendary missile launcher that has targeting computer which does the same thing as dragonrend
---
I just want them to fix the stuff that's already in the game before adding anything else lol 
---
Forgive my lack of knowledge, I don't own Fallout 76 yet; I keep browsing the subreddit if it's time to buy it.  
---
When it first launched I saw posts and videos where people would frequently request to join a party with a player through the map to get access to a free teleport. Was this changed or is it just not as prevalent as I was lead to believe?
---
Clara!
---
Of course they were lying. I've seen several make such claims, but none actually show any proof whatsoever.
---
One guy said he would post it but never heard from him again. They were just taking advantage of how gullible people here are, and how easily people are willing to believe the worst.
---
Hahahaha (inhales) hahahahahahaha (inhales) hahahahahahaha. You don't know how to return stuff to a retailer? Holy fucking shitbags, what do they teach you fuckers in school?
---
The one problem I see with this is that because Bethesda waited so long to start banning dupers the dupers have been able to spread their duped wares around by various means, almost certainly resulting in some people picking up a duper's waste with tens/hundreds of thousands of something in them and getting banned as a result even though they themselves never duped.
---
They should certainly have known better than to keep what is obviously the result of an exploit or glitch, but they'll get banned from Bethesda's service for something that I don't think is technically against the Terms of Service, which I think is a bit wrong.
---
It's funny that you're asking for full confidence for your game for the shit you've pulled over the last 2 months. 
---
Same here.
---
Yup. I have been wanting an anti armor-crit damage-less vats cost rifle for weeks now. It gives me those rolls....on a 50 cal...
---
What about players killing to get other people stuff.. Pvp. Workshop versus event my stach are full because of that 
---
Except some people dont make very much money and can only afford maybe 1-2 new games a year. And when you FUCK over your loyal fans who've been around since the morrowind days to this hard a degree, you'd BETTER expect some bitching. 
---
Oh and thanks for dropping by to bitch about the bitchers. You're a vagina amongst vaginas. 
---
Thanks! I'll be grinding workshops more!
---
What mutations can you craft and what's the price? I need carnivore, adrenal reaction, grounded, and marsupial. I'll be on in 12 hours
---
I was in a nuke zone earlier today, on Ps4 
---
Any..... "luck"? :P
---
Make sure you take some sort of collateral .. make sure you get caps and tell the person you will give it back .. do not do 0 caps, someone lost 3 TSE weapons because he was too trusting .. if the person says they don't have caps or sounds suspect, don't do it ..  but yes many take and run away ..

There’s an AP regeneration bug that’s been present for awhile now. For example, AP regeneration is vastly slowed down or stops multiple times at certain increments before regenerating again without making actions that would cause a stop in AP regeneration such as standing still or running but not sprinting. Also affects aids that grant AP regen or refills AP like corn soup and canned coffee. Could be caused by the Scaly Skin or Grounded mutations as I only noticed this after acquiring them. Really makes fights and V.A.T.S. use extremely debilitating. Even with Perk Cards that increase AP regen like Action Boy/Girl, Lone Wanderer, and Nerd Rage (I’ve stacked all three to test) the regeneration of AP is still extremely slow and stops in increments before filling completely after receiving said mutations. I’ve read other posts about this issue, mainly concerning the Scaly Skin mutation, so I know it’s not only me or on my end.
---
I picked up a vampire Tesla rifle off of a vendor, figured it would be useful for tagging in nuke zones but would probably break pretty fast like laser guns. Probably have some issues with the vampire effect. Kinda love the thing now and use it a lot hahaha
---
It has happened and there’s a few posts about it. It’s inevitable.
---
Personally I’d be down to trade items but I would NEVER drop first. If the other guy didn’t want to drop first either, I’d suggest buying my item for a fair price (let’s say 5k for the purpose of this example) and then I’d buy his item for 5k. Successful trade. If he leaves, I still have the 5k at least.
---
good idea..we both put a 2k cap price on the item..
---
I’ve never met a cheater that was banned admit they were cheating. They always say “I was banned unfairly”. My friends son is 11 or 12 and he finds every single cheat possible in every game he plays.guven the fact that it’s all over YouTube I’d imagine most kids are that way.
---
Its a nice idea but i don‘t think it‘ll work out. 
---
If you are forced to Choose a Faction you won‘t have the Chance to make all quests to all different factions and don‘t have Access to (for Exemple) the X-01 Power Armor. 
---
Its a Little Bit like wow, two of More factions are Fighting wach other but in fact fallout isn‘t wow It won‘t Be the same. If a Feature like that would Be Added to the pvp-Mode, so you have the Chance to Explore all different factions in the Adventure-Mode, it‘s might Worth a try. 
---
Besides that If Most of the Players are Achtung like Wanderers Not anyone would Be happy about it and the (in my opinion) enjoyable game get‘s more and more hate. 
---
This tells you which plans match which objects [https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl](https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl)
---
Teach your son cheating is bad
---
Also check perks immediately have had an unfortunate incident before and now I always check the item in question but other then that my experiences have always been pleasant most the people I play with now are traders I've met.
---
I launched one a couple nights ago, because that's pretty much all there is that's interesting to do in the game at the minute.
---
My TSE submachine gun did nothing though, and there was only one other person in there with me (a lvl57 and me, a lvl122). Needless to say, we failed that event.
---
I have four trophies left on this game, and that seems to be the only thing that keeps me going back (yes, I'm a trophy whore)
---
Bethesda could have resolved the duping issue with a very simple patch.
---
* Lock Legendary items to the account/character that first picks them up.
---
* Disable dropping / trading of legendary items.
---
* Enable scrapping of legendary items.
---
Those three things would kill the out of game cash market for legendary items, it would also kill the internal dupe and trade of legendary items.  People who have massive stashes of legendaries would be stuck with them, and the only way to get rid of them would be to scrap them.
---
Other things they should do.
---
* Turn bobble heads and magazines back into 'own one: gain peppermint passive perk'  instead of the chem mechanics they have now.  It would prevent stacking exploits.
---
* If you don't know how to craft a chem or (chem like) item, Limit the amount of that item that you can carry at any one time. Allow uncapped storage of said items in the stash though.. the idea is to deter duping, not handicap legit play.
---
* Lock bags to the creator of the bag for 3/4ths its in world life, only after that time is up, unlock it for anyone to browse/loot. (maybe have it change color?) If people want to exchange items, they should do it through the trade system.
---
* Add a 'suspicious' button to the trade menu system which reports the player you are trading with, to streamline the identification of dupers. But, also add some sort of penalty for falsely reporting people to prevent abuse.
---
* Disable transferring inventory objects into lootable corpses and objects.  If you want to get rid of something, sell it, or scrap it, or drop it in a player-locked bag.
---
* Enable a traveling merchant flag, similar to the 'wanted' flag, so you are lit up on the map, indicating you are looking to trade with others. (NOTE: When this mode is enabled, you should have the option of becoming immune to player attack and unable to inflict damage on other players, to prevent people hunting traders who do not wish to engage in PVP.  This feature should have a cool down/warm up timer to prevent abuse while in PVP)
---
I’ve yet to hear about any lies.. just dummy talking points.. if you don’t like the game, move on. If you do, play.
---
I didn't ask for shit. Bethesda made a game and I played it. Remember fuckers, this is Bethesdas' baby. Not yours. 
---
It was heavy handed but it has helped me switch it up recently started playing with pistols and my god the westerns I have....If they do ever balance it out I don't think I'll ever use another 🔫 then my AA explosive going to be trying out vats and psychopath with gun fu seems like it would be nasty as hell.

Extremely affordable excavator calibrated shocks mod(need two:left/right legs) at harpers ferry vendor bot. Spawn then hop into the large hole in the brick wall then follow path straight back to safely reach vendor.
---
Me and my bro been playing for a good three hours now. Server ALMOST disconnected like thirty minutes in but it's been fine ever since.
---
If you trading multiple items for a PA Set, get them to sell pieces of the PA, like legs first, then arms, then the rest, vs a promise for the enquire set .. just assume you going to get ripped off, but not everyone will rip you off, but you don't know.
---
I haven't had a dc in two days after switching to 5 ghz wlan connection from 2.4 ghz.
---
Ditto for hard bargain, green thumb, travel agent, chemist... 
---
I think the point was that you as a player have to make choices when you make your build. Do you pick up damage perks or something that gives utility?
---
They made it very easy to swap perks and people started doing that so they can have their optimal damage build and only swap when they need to pick a lock or hack a terminal.
---
Now people have been complaining for some time they want these perks to be passives. But where does it end? Lead Belly is entirely passive, i can just opt to only equip it when i eat or drink. Just one example out of many such perks.
---
So where does this end? If we go down this route we're going to end up with everyone just building for damage and weight reduction, while enjoying all the utility perks passively. We'll all be playing basicly the same character.
---
I think they should make it more difficult to swap perks. Have player commit to a build more. I don't want to end up playing the clone wars out there. It's bad enough as it is with every other player basicly being power armor dude with sledgehammer.
---
It's like the universe revolves around each of these fuckers on here. Am I right? Hey assholes, you're not special or important.
---
Freedom of speech

Wonder how much longer Bethesda has to fuck up before he finally bitches lol. Loyal blind fanboy to the end? Maybe lol

Why do people playing video games need months of 'patience'? Are we reasonably expected to endure a long period of mediocrity before what we paid for is brought to an acceptable standard?
---
the thought that 'patience' in expectation for leisure activities is a good trait is laughable, if you have 'patience' enjoy getting walked all over by corporations who just want some money from you right here and now.
---
Is the "voice" volume in your settings turned off?

It was the Finns in ww2 indeed. Molotov's were used as primitive but effective and cheap anti armor weapons to kill Russian tanks. Throw couple on the tank engine air intake and it's dead, Jim. "Totally not cool" said all the Russians in their tanks that suck in air burning at hundreds of degrees celcius when air was supposed to be -20c. 
---
Gunsmith perk, takes 5 to max out...
---
Perhaps you should whine to the mods to add a Rule #11: No complaining. But first you should tell them to remove the sticky *Fallout 76 Issues and Feedback Thread* and also to ban the Bethesda CM accounts so they stop encouraging people to post issues and complaints.
---
There's a bug where you get the hula-hula guy over and over again without even having Serendipity on 
---
Thank you! Because of past fallout games i always assumed it just let you craft better weapons
---
B-b-but Clara did the Duping WTF 
---
Mutations are screwed. They just stop working randomly, and it really sucks when it stops mid trying to survive a lvl 91 glowing deathclaw... 
---
If they have a good karma score you shouldn't have a problem.

Unless it’s grape mentats. /finger guns

That shit will get you more money and you’ll pay a lot less.

As in like straight jackets? Or

No worries, they break 50% slower when maxed...

Say that to all the scorched molerats and dogs and ticks and conquerors I killed to keep the other players free. 
---
My lv38 with 15 luck soloed BOTB. Jack me off now guys........
---
This game is PEGI 18, so obviously your 8 year old son isn't enjoying it.
---
Yeah because sadly the worst build in the game is guerilla build due to lack of guns it works with. 
---
Invisible enemies, it happens....
---
Return of the soup nazi! NO SOUP FOR YOU!
---
Only thing that worked for me was to leave the silo and come back after 10 mins. Had to initiate launch prep again, but that was all.
---
Nowadays I just glitch through the roof to get to the launch prep area in 1 min. Bethesda has exploited my freetime enough that I'm fine with skipping 90% of the silo after 50+ clears.
---
Everything seems clear except for “We feel confident that any player that has picked up that quantity of items that are designed to be rare inside the game did not obtain them via any legitimate means.”.
---
So, what about those dupe hunters or the ones that kill and stumble upon a paper bag filled with tons of stuff. There were posts here about people taking all the items and jumping into a fizzire site or dropping them at the bottom of a lake. Are they safe? Or could those just be tall tales too?
---
Don't fight enemies 30 levels above your own unless you know what your doing. This is not common fucking sense or what?
---
wait for survival mode. it is for you.
---
I've heard rumours about the Flatwoods Alien, but all the believers are insane in the membrane.
---
Hi Todd, it’s me. I was wondering if you could add the Havel and Ornstein armors from the game *Dark Souls* to the Atom Shop?
---
 Also, this might be a little controversial, but I was wondering if you could add the game *Timesplitters 2* as a holotape game. 
---
We appreciate all you do and look forward to your reply. Thank you Bethesda for fixing the bugs!! 
---
The bloodied vats sneak build is very good for clearing the silo by the way, I use it for my speed runs 
---
Ap cost is based on a weapon's base weight, the minigun eats all of your AP in like 2 or 3 shots, maybe 4 or five if you are hardcore built around it and boost your AP with food. Even the gatling gun that does 7 times the damage and costs less ap is borderline unusable.
---
Lesson learned. Did you really have to bore us with this post though?
---
Do you not read your perk cards before equipping them? 
---
Get weapon artisans maxed if you can, it dubles the CND
---
No, that is of course still possible, but not that 'exploitable' as it still is kind of a gamble, as most players don't accept random team invites (including me).
---
Yes, the glass cannon all in damage build is completely broken with how easily it craps on the armor system and turns enemies into mush. The problem is in how ANY OTHER build gets crapped on in equal measure by the system.
---
There are no locked containers worth picklock 3 or master hacker swapping, the loot is lame.
---
If you want, you can have a have canon justification, pick lock perk swapping in = your character cracking their knuckles and listening to the lock. Master Hacker=looking up a manual. 
---
Unless you are a true picklock and hacker master amd never swap out. 
---
This was my understanding

Enclave had close ties to and much influence over Vault Tech much like a Private company under military contract.
---
There ARE people on the bazaar who are known scammers and change accounts every couple of days. Funny thing is, you always recognize them due to the way they advertise and reply. Yesterday, on of the scammers (Jimmyguyz or something) was having a conversation with one of his alt accounts because he wanted to make the impression that there was a trade going on between them and that he is trustworthy . It was hilarious. But most of them are honest people. 
---
5 characters huh? You're a fucking loser and need to reevaluate your life.
---
This is why I loved open mic.
---
Thats awesome and very reassuring..........now when are you going to stop the scorchbeasts spamming the bitch scream all the time? 
---
perception shouldn't make a difference (unless they changed it again and I didn't notice. The looking down thing is because information loads better off screen . it wouldn't work better if there were a stream beneath your feet. I've multiple characters and perception doesn't seem to be slowing me down. Spawning where enemies spawn might though, and can get you killed. spawning arounf your camp is bad but if your camp has a large amount of resources and low defense can mess you up real bad. I don't know if that is changed, but I'm pretty sure having more defense means you get less but I could be wrong lets fuckin figure this shit out. How do we fix the servers lol.
---
I used to like saying I was saving the world by recycling when I played crafting. noow that is way different lol, do not do that lol. it's probably a really good guild idea dude
---
Fallout 76 is not a game yet. It is a big testing area for some kind of survival game, which could be released some day in the future. No one would make a real game on this old platform with so many bugs on it. Real games have just a few bugs and they are made with new engines.
---
Shows up as "BoS Legs, BoS Arms" or somethin like that.
---
Fuck, sever hop n' figure it out bud.
---
This community is a bunch of fucking whiny millennial cocksuckers. Fuck this community. Up their assholes. With roughcut cedar.
---
I had that too, they seemed to keep multiplying xD
---
But that isn't the issue I'm sure... Because I could still place them back or scrap them again and the resources went back to my stash... 
---
I really hope Bethesda can figure this out. 
---
It's not a matter of life and death, its wrong to sell a product and expect customers to wait before it's up to a certain standard.
---
If you cant see that that's fine :)
---
Countless improvements though...you could probably count them on your toes if you really wanted to.
---
Friend of mine had 300 purified water and had it taken for duping even though he got it completely legit 
---
Didn't even know that setting existed. I don't know how that got lowered, strange. Thanks though! 
---
OH MY FUCKING WORD. YOU MOTHERFUCKING BABY ASS SHITBAG FUCKS STILL CAN'T BEAT SCORCHBEASTS. DO NOT PLAY FO76, THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU ENTITLED BABIES.
---
lvl 187 here. Crafting Perk cards are wisely chosen first and maxed. lvl xxx players dont have to worry about dying in events or mobbed by hordes. Glowers can surround my character and alls I got to do is eye the legendarys in the mob mele them down then loot the shitty 1 star wood armor or on occasion the 3 star weapon/armor that you're not sure if it's good until it's used.
---
But talking about patience...whats equal price. A coffeemaker? Microwave? You buying a product - you expect it to work. So got to understand if peoples patience is gone after 3 months imo
---
Yeah, those bots are hiding a nuclear keycode, would be kinda cheesy if they were easy to catch. Oh nevermind, I forgot you millennial fuckers want everything fucking handed to you......
---
F*ck you, Todd! 
---
Like those fuckers who claimed over and over that Bobblehead stacking didn’t let you one shot pacifist players. Obvious lies spread by duper cheats.

Its at the flower icon yes?
---
Delusions are what you're experiencing. Go lift weights, meditate, walk, jog, run and don't look back for immediate cure.
---
Lol the bug was in skyrim too. this goes way beyond the beta
---
I did exactly the same thing, one click and I bought the stupid thing and wasted 500 atoms 😕
---
I would want guarantees that the new owner would like the IP though, can't have them getting bored after a few years and pulling a Bethesda.
---
Didn't read your ideas but wanted to stop by and tell you to shove your ideas up your ass. Bethesda doesn't need your ideas.
---
Well, the nerf to White Knight sucks and getting rid of rad-x stacking went against Fallout 4’s functioning. 
---
Karma isn't really an important factor there are plenty of shady traders and dupers with a metric ton of karma tbh.
---
OK I have Starched 2\* now so I can keep RadX to turn off mutations if needed, thanks for that and your great informative OP post.
---
I've come to think that "running" in stealth just means moving while crouched. Just means you can move and fire and still not be detected, as the enemies will fire at the area your last shot came from and not track your movement.
---
I completely agree with all of your points, absolutely. This is just a pet peeve of mine. Perhaps I shouldn’t have posted. I love this game and I don’t want to pile on the posts already here. 
---
It’s just a pet peeve. I think having quick swap builds would help a lot. 
---

Sorry, chief

Something odd happened to me a while back and I was worried I'd be banned. I was exploring a nuked zone, and stumbled upon a "paper bag" with a massive amount of junk. In a time when I was struggling to find enough screws, this bag had 200+ screws, among other common junk items, nothing extremely rare.  
---
I took it all. Was over weight for a while, each day I sold some of what I didn't want off to the vendor bots until I could get my weight down to a manageable number.  
---
I don't know if I "stole" from a player who'd died and couldn't make it back to their bag (I was under the impression nobody could loot my bag), or if it was some shady business involving duping gone wrong.  
---
In any case, I was not banned, or contacted by game GMs, or anything. So when I saw the post about that yesterday I doubtful of the truthfulness of it.
---
I've got a hunters long coat?
---
We'd have less problems with weight if armor wasn't unequipped when putting on PA. You're not taking off the armor and going commando under there because it's clearly there when we enter and exit. I use Deep Pocketed Leather armor so I just lose weight capacity in PA.
---
Germany is fallout
---
There is no defending that. It's shitty how they handled all that, but things were looking good after the first January patch and even then people were actively ruining its reputation even more by spreading lies.
---
I'm not blindly defending BGS, I quit the game and don't even have it installed until they add some more stuff, but the last thing this game needs is people hating on it despite not playing it.
---
I had a similar issue on my Ryzen 7 1700 as well, I found alt-tabbing to another program would unfreeze the game, and after I upgraded from 16 gig to 32 gig ram, the issue stopped entirely. 
---
Should also note, during freezing time period I switched from full screen to border-less windowed mode, which helped regain control when the game froze as I can simply alt-tab out of the game and bring another program into the foreground.  That is how I learned that simply shunting the game into the background caused it to unfreeze.  (I think it may have something to do with memory allocation or thread usage on ryzen processors) 
---
During my search for a solution, I read that people were recommending restricting the game to just the physical cores of the cpu. I tried that through the task manager/set affinity, but it only seemed to cause stuttering game performance.
---
Anyway, check your ram usage, and see if there's anything you can do to free up more system ram.
---
The kindest thing to say is that management fucked up and released the game too early.
---
Yeah man, lol just slink off into the ether cos no one gives  a fuck 😂😂😂😂
---
welch station , 100 % confirmed by myself
---
Plan name is Lever Gun
---
good luck
---
Grafton Station was where I'd gotten mine
---
Level of detail in this and other Beth games is amazing. They still are the masters of world crafting.
---
Lmao yeah, and Bethesda even came out with a post detailing the bans. I don't buy this dudes story tbh. Definitely not saying Bethesda didn't make a mistake (cause we know they've done that once or twice...) but I just don't really know about this one. Plus people love to hate Bethesda (some warranted some not) these days so it's easy to add fuel to the fire. 
---
Thank you!
---
Imagine being of the scammers.. a truly tragic life.
---
You're welcome 
---
Oh thank you and I enjoy fallout.
---
I was wondering:   Will there be a fallout set for Xbox 1 and PlayStation 4?  I've played 3 and 4.  Never heard of 1 and 2. Brother told me those are computer games.
---
Is there going to be a version of those 2 for consoles??
---
I've been playing fallout 76 since Day One when my brother purchased Xbox one tricentennial for $80 from Wal-Mart.
---
I like your glitches    
---
I take pictures and videos and post them to my Instagram timmy30274
---
You know, I kinda believe the people accusing Bethesda of unwarranted banning rather than this shill. There are bound to be a few who claim innocence, but let's be real. Bethesda DOES tell us sweet little lies. This is simply a matter of assuming that someone is trustworthy because they've given me no reason to distrust them. Bethesda on the other hand... 
---
They should run official discord server for trade and advertise it in game
---
You can't use the words "literally unplayable" together on a game that you can just go in and play yourself. Who taught you the meaning of the word "literally"?
---
If you got banned you can literally buy it again(provided you have enough money) and literally play it again since it's literally playable.
---
That's awesome thanks man! I wish I had your wisdom 12 hours ago xD
---
you also cannot search them half the time
---
Technically you can tame a lvl 91 deathclaw, but once he gets home his level goes down to 21-31. At least that's what happened to me. https://imgur.com/a/8MHF9S1
---
I play a sneak sniper without much issue. It is bugged by always being on (caution). Scorchbeasts have always been able to detect me sneaking. I think that bug has always been an issue. Other than that I don’t have an issue. Mole rats are fine. I can sneak into a room and stand right in front of scorched or super mutants without being detected. I enjoy sneaking and face shotting up close. 
---
When will people realize a reddit post alone is not proof of a bug? This isn't the first time something like this hapoened. The people on here that spread it should be banned. 
---
I'm sorry man, I've got an extra ultracite explosive vent plan and 2* wooden armour peice that she would have dropped for you though
---
 Death bags are freely lootable. You recieve a message stating something like "Your scrap has been looted by another player."
---
Downvote for idiocy
---
If they say they don't have caps say they give the item to you first if they have a problem with that their is something malicious going on.
---
You mean like when I'm trying to find a brown bag in green and brown dirt that looks all the same to me?  I'd spent several minutes finding my baggie despite the fact there's a quest marker telling me where it is.  CDPR had awesome colorblind settings for Witcher III.
---
It's a bug. In the patch they fixed radworms so it did actually increase your rad damage by 50%. However, in doing so it also increases *all* "spell" (mutations, chems, basically anything) by 50% too. 
---
Kicker is it also fucks with your mutations once it's cured for some reason. Lost my marsupial jump until relog once radworms went away.
---
I keep a Dragon on me just for this reason. Ten bullets max, that's all you'll ever need. Enough sneak shots and they usually either piss off or land. 
---
You can only tame creatures that spawn from random events.
---
They said that's for people acquiring this stuff in a non-intended way. Killing another player to get 500000 ultracite was never an intended way of gathering ultracite imo. Should you kill a duper, leave the stuff there. You can't hinder anything as long as you can't sever their brain.
---
I've been reliablybibfirned by data miners that this isn't the case, do you have any proof of what you say? 
---
It's a new bug introduced in the latest patch or hotfix. It can be a bit random but it's mostly torso for me.
---
I think there are too many complex item calculations been done that they simply cannot make graphics more detailed.
---
The game looks like Bioshock 1 in many aspects. Graphic details are around the same, but bioshock 1 had linear and small level design, which allowed them to put almost all system resources on graphics, especially water.
---
Nowadays most games must look really nice and realistic in order to get good reviews. Usually they'll get away with scripted, linear story and predetermined objects, and ofc years of development.
---
Fallout 76 is a proof that no game should be released too early. It just doesn't work...
---
Reading the break up posts are sad and pathetic. As soon as I see several paragraphs why a player is going to EmoQuit I roll my eyes so hard you can hear it in China. 
---
I would take the bos arms plans, if you have one spare...
---
[It happens](https://imgur.com/a/SBtCSVC)
---
CAP STASHES ARE BUGGED!
---
They still spawn like before they were made into containers AND you cannot search them half the time!
---
If I'd have picked up or bought every one I've seen in game I'd have a similar amount.
---
The problem with this theory is this: There is only one party that gains from saying 'we did nothing wrong'. If a player gets banned, literally no one cares unless that player is a famous twitch streamer. If a company bans players under false pretense, claiming that it was done for legitimate reasons can actually make that company seem like less of a douche. Bethesda lies, that is a known variable.  
---
are you exploring more caps on vendors?
---
But Skyrim is a game everyone should play. Call me Skyrim biased, I am Skyrim biased, this game offers so much to experience.
---
You'll be fine OP. The same people crying about getting banned were the ones using the carry weight glitch, holding 2,000 explosive bobbleheads, usings nothing but TSE weapons and maxed out caps. 
---
Basically no one that will be missed. 
---
Canvas bags, Nuka Dark Rum
---
Teach your lawyer that slander is good.
---
So u admit u glitch the weight limit and tax the server with it keeping an eye on ur crazy amount of things ;)
---
It means you all have a shit build.*

Oh man I never followed up on these and I assumed Pipe was some kind of new Jet or Superjet people were packing into a pipe and lodging directly into their brains.

They said earlier in January that something called "player Vending" is coming. It's up to us to figure out what this means, don't watch YouTube tho, YouTubers probably post shit like "Fallout 76 now allows players to sell illegal real world substances", judging by how much they sell their souls for views.
---
also encountered this, at bog town, 1 enemy underground prevented me from claiming the workshop
---
Had a really nice anti armor 10mm auto that absolutely chewed through things when sneak shot.
---
Eventually sold it because it chewed through ammo and it was easier/less expensive to hit them with Knuckles. That and the damn thing weighed about fifteen pounds. 
---
You seem to have cared enough to make this post
---
That bug has been in the game even before the last two patches. 
---
I didn't realize that bullet sponge enemies were "mature".
---
This has already been debunked.  Please stop refeeding rumor-posts.
---
I'm still getting over 100 on my Combat rifle... maybe you need to re look at your perk cards.
---
It is not a violation of 1st Amendment rights, but it most certainly is an anti-consumer policy.
---
Excellent write up, a refreshing change from twenty posts a day about how Bethesda is losing someone as a fan because of XXXX after 400 hours of gameplay. 
---
Don't worry, patch #6 will bring melee damage in line with ranged damaged and then everything will be OK.
---
Source? I don’t live on reddit so I wouldn’t know.
---
Not true. Also who cares about Germany. They’re like the size of Pennsylvania. 
---
Yup.
---
Gtafton station had it

Trash perk but so necsssary, rip to 5 points in intelligence not like I'd ever want to use other perks...

---
Seriously I've made hundreds of throwing knives in one click click click span. Never banned. If they ban me for that I'll let everyone know.
---
I do, and I don’t care about your country either. Have a nice day.
---
Halloween Candy? Are you for real? 500.000 is "too much"?
---
Its an event where you can literally go afk after collecting a single bucket. its not even hard to collect that amount in 30 days.
---
I've turned my attention toward debuffing when in a party. I use a medic's explosive double barrel. By stacking enforcer, tenderizer, and suppressor I've been able to soften enemies up so my team isn't wasting a ton of ammo. 
---
Who assures me that those "hunters" aren't bloodthirsty PvP alpha males trying to prove they are the best in business and won't come after me when they have no dupers to hunt. I've already had someone call me a duper because I had 97 plasma cores in my inventory.
---
RemindMe! 7 hours
---
Im camped here on xbox, I've moved my base several times and always find myself back here. I am convinced it is actually the best location for a camp for end game players in regards to location and the fact there is a resource deposit. It doesnt look like you built on it but just next to your campfire outside the cove in the water is an acid deposit. 
---
So why are the former random \*bos combat plans\* not permanently avaiable for a lvl92 char? Are they categorized as loose mods?
---
$5 escort no protection risky
---
So that means certain perks, buffs or something else causes the bug, not the perks itself probably. 
---
The transistor was never invented in the fallout world.
---
Probably the very same moment when people realize that liars can't be trusted to speak truthfully. For example, I can take a rando at their word until they are proven to be a liar. I can't put any faith in Badthesda because of all the lies and shitty practices I've heard and seen over the years.
---
"TSE WERE NEVER THE PROBLEM" yea...say that when u come across a TSE COMBAT shotgun and u get one shot from a distance that's just totally BS...also crafting ammo makes sence since some of it isn't exacally as common as u would like...as a heavy gun user crafting ammo is needed
---
Wow, that made me laugh. I like the game, but I don't see world expansions ever coming, or any content besides missions and Atom Shop items. I feel like F76 is a side project that the ES6 devs will spend time on for like 1 hour every day coding certain events to let us feel like new content is being developed.
---
The only difference in the time line is that the transistor was never invented in this time line.
---
This is an example of why I hate this community. The most innocuous comments get downvoted for not being outright, diehard loyal.
---
Sure! What do you think about hello kitty?
---
I noticed yesterday that Gulpers were immune to sneak after a single shot. And unlike you it was from distance, chameleon'd and not moving. One shot gave me danger status right away, on three waves of Gulpers. Ridiculous. 
---
What about people who already have these immense amount of items in their storage already? What will happen to them? The people that already duped all their stuff
---
There's a mod for that. I don't use mods, however, so I can't speak to their reliability or usefulness.

---
omg yeah rockstar is horrible. If a hacker drops money on your head you get banned. If you used flux you get banned (flux is a program that changed brightness of windows depending on the time of day)
---
That company is notorious for banning innocent people. Just because a company says they don't ban innocent people, does not make it true. There's ALWAYS cases of innocent players getting banned in every online game.
---
&gt; as aluminum seems to be a pain in the neck to come by (and i don't know what items contain it)
---
Go to the junk tab in your pip boy : there's an alternate view for base materials. You can tag each for search and a magnifying glass icon will appear next to items containing that material.
---
Ah, thank you. I saw oxhorn's stream today and kept wondering what the magnifying glasses meant.
---
how do you prove it?
---
Courier Offices would be more in line with Fallout's history, with the possibility to build a drop-off and pickup  point for Couriers (Eyebots or drones) at your camp, otherwise you just visit the closest courier station for sending and picking up packages. Personally I would like to send a very valuable gambling chip... any available couriers?
---
Perhaps they didn't have a tool at launch.  It's clear they do now. 
---
You're an idiot
---
I had an issue earlier today because I found her meat pile but it was unlootable under the map. 
---
Only issue is if people kill a duper and loot them, suddenly you're in violation of the rules. May seem obvious to us, but less so for the average player.
---
Post number 10 of someone crippled by losing TSE. 
---
Pick an easier game, junior. You don't know what you're doing.
---
Awesome thanks for posting I'm testing this out tonight!!!
---
I have not crashed once after this new patch so idk xb1
---
But why? What motivation would they have? In order to do that they would have to of either programmed a shitty detector (pretty unlikely since it literally just looks for a number of items collected over a number of days, freshmen in college level shit) or even more unlikely they would have to randomly ban for no reason then lie about it. I trust Bethesda here just based on motives. Someone has more motive to lie about cheating than some company has to lie about accidentally banning some people. 
---
I have a master lockpick/hacker Stealth Archer non-PA infiltrator type build, where I dont have to swap cards to lockpick or hack while still having the cards I want, I like this archetype.
---
And I have a PA Heavy Gunner who cant lockpick or hack.
---
I fail to see why you should be able to open every loot container and hack every computer without running the cards for it, I think card swapping was a mistake from the get-go. Actually, I think the whole leveling perk card system is a terrible rpg system, but thats just my opinion.
---
Imo there shouldnt be any weapon damage perk cards, and instead use weapon proficiency, your weapon recoil, accuracy etc gets better the more you use the gun, and then tie SPECIAL as a requirement for weapons, cant use heavy guns if insufficient strength, smg/pistol reload speed depends on agility, increased ADS/Scope accuracy with perception, melee/dmg swing speed tied to strength etc. You get the gist of it.
---
And instead have weapon damage tied only to the weapon, its barrel, ammo/magazine type, reciever.
---
Then you won't have a pseudo-choice like dmg vs. utility/QoL.
---
Would be easier to balance as well.
---
I found the plan at Camden Park laying next to a weapons bench. Haven’t been back to check again though. 
---
you are right
---
this.... so annoying to have to swap them in and out.
---
That's a nice playstyle, I think playing support could be really rewarding but there's not enough perks/ equipment to really incentivise it.
---
Like the % numbers on tenderizer are pretty small and most of the others involve just reviving people and providing them with a small buff.

Has anybody managed to resolve this?

its kind of amazing that all bethesda has to do is make a post like this, that proves absolutely nothing, to get everyone back on their side. And somehow everyone believes them even though they have repeatedly let everyone down.

Explosive has dropped for me, two shot has dropped for me. Never both at the same time. I’ve pulled 2 3* Legendary weapons, a Gauss and a Hunting Rifle. I don’t want those, either. I’m playing PA+ .50 Cal, basically the guy that walks into a firefight blasting away that other people dive behind. I’m the Tank role in a multiplayer game where there are no assigned roles. This wasn’t easy to do at all until I started getting into Bullet Sponge, btw. 
---
The thing that sucks is how much of my resources go into repairing and maintaining my ammo supply. One Nuke Zone will deplete this completely. Most enemies will get shredded, but the Queen is damn near immune to me with her current AI and how much I have to deal with mobs. So I’ve decided that during Scorched Earth I’ll deal with the mobs and get hits on the Queen while I can. Somebody has to, and you know it won’t be the 7 guys below level 30 wearing hazmats suits and hiding in the shed. (They really should scale the fight appropriately, btw.)
---
Dude, you can't imagine how thrilled I am to go in 10 years on the subreddit of fallout 76 4.0 and find a thread from a guy who is mad about a boss leaving the map caused by THE SAME BUG as here, in which a guy tells someone: "dude, calm down! it's not a big deal. at least they acknowlede it!"

I'd recommend finding one of the many perk builders on the internet and pick out your build now so you know where to be putting points. Gotta maximize the amount of cards you get late game.
---
Okay here's the thing that is invading the game industry, maybe it's been here, I don't know: the hook, nerf, switch, nerf, grind trap. Games usually "rebalance" shit once the core audience is hooked and approaching the dreaded endgame where they may stop. So, they add more grinding and more time played by switching to a different flavor of the month that will surely be changed by the time you adapt. 
---
Kind of like how FIFA always adds new better player cards for their card mode, how online games always add new quests or items, etc. 
---
&gt; Once you master it, you feel complete and that's the last thing any game wants. 
---
I have 1 perception on my main character. Making the skills passive would give me an advantage other builds don't have. I still think it shouldn't be. It would seem to me y'all need something like a perk loadout manager
---
It's kind of amazing that all bethesda has to do is make a post like this, that proves absolutely nothing, to get everyone back on their side. And somehow everyone believes them even though they have repeatedly let everyone down. How can people not question their ability to properly ban people after all there screw ups. I don't understand it! Let's all believe the corporation over players. great idea. always works.
---
We'd still get the clickbait and posts here "*Bethesda uses free labour from modder to fix their game!!*".
---
Personally I'd like them to involve modders though. Whoever is now looking after the game now probably is learning some things while they go. Modders have been using previous versions of this engine and some probably have a good idea of where to fix certain things straight away.
---
I craft ammo at an insane rate and I've never been banned. It's people lying to destabilise the community and the game like with the trade stealing "bug" a while ago.
---
...good point
---
Don't game shame me. Maybe I move really, really slow due to my toon's role playing passions. ;) Some toons collect blackberries, who is to say collecting single action ivory pistol grips is wrong?
---
Haters gonna hate, i got more hours than You sure, and for your happiness, i got answered back by Bethesda that os gonna verify what o sayed, since they know this issue, You probably duped or buyed and helped them doing this, peoples like You must Be deleted, kid 😉

When fallout meets real life
---
Not me. I just finished the Belly of the Beast quest line not long ago.
---
I must have been lucky but the cavern is buggy af. I'm not the least bit surprised you're having the problems that you are.
---
No spoilers but its bugginess, particularly towards the end, is truly a sight to behold.
---
WoW suspended me years ago for "manipulating the economy" and would give no further explanation, so I tend to not write off complaints of unfair bans so quickly. I still have no idea what I did to piss off Blizzard.
---
Umm... no...?
---
My worry is that if they add the perk (whatever it was called in F4) as a card that it will fall under the strength tree. I'm not super into melee but I have a 1 Handed stealth build and I wasn't able to equip a full suite of damage perks on account of Travelling Pharmacy, which as a Chem fiend hoarder is pretty much mandatory.
---
I was really intrigued with the perk system when I first started playing but all the flaws are starting to show in the late game. 
---
It's odd. It's this mix of 'do your own thing' that can also be taken as 'we didn't really plan shit, we just brought the location' and everyone feels differently. 
---
You can switch them around later. Do whatever 
---
When they handed out apology in game currency before people complained about it. Stop trying to think for them, you’re not good at it.
---
They can't tell the dupers from the resellers on LFG. And all traders are pretty much resellers now. Ever sell a TSE gun? You're a dupe reseller. Some resellers are just closer to the well than others. Where is bethesda supposed to draw the line? Like specifically. Give me 2 examples that are close together and 1 is acceptable but the other isnt. Like obviously a 1 million pound account, or a guy thay sold 1 tse he used for a month fit those 2 categories, but an enforceable policy has to have a clear and specific line in the sand.
---
Are you an antivaxxer and/or my grandmother? You realize that a lie has to be intentionally false, right? Incompetence at rolling out a video game that many feel is in a bad state is not a lie. The canvas bag was not a lie. The short beta was not a lie. The bugs are not lies. You spending money on a game you are unhappy with is not a lie.  
---
Tbf Fallout is known for bugs and was always great regardless 
---
You only get the ultracite power armour plans this way... you don’t get any of the mods for them which OP was looking for.
---
Bless the poor soul that does this. 
---
I’m able to do more than one thing at a time
---
Could keep the cost of fast travel and just up the reward for events.
---
I would say your rping as a Nomad....by everyone agrees being over encumbered sssuuuucckkkssss
---
I believe one thing that really needs to be addressed is social menus failing to sync. Mine wouldn't sync for a week. After patch, mine started working but now my friend's social menu won't sync. A multiplayer fallout that you can't play with friends isn't multiplayer
---
As no one cares about your opinion, yet you still post it here... 
---
it could be worse, that you actually kill the queen and running to loot her just to be disconnected from the server.
---
Well I don't know about that. I've been support from the get go and there is a lot of cool mechanics that you can play with. 
---
For example my character is an empath sharing max bodyguard. This makes even the sniper in my party tankier. I have also made my self into an aoe heal bomb by combining team medic with a medic pump. Now whenever I go below 50% health I release a wave of healing. 
---
Another fun trick is sharing mysterious savior. This essentially gives you the ability to long range revive party members without pulling out of the fight to do it yourself. 
---
That's not even mentioning half the things support focused characters can do. Healing hunger/thirst, curing rads, curing disease, increasing experience, lowering travel cost are all within the support wheel house. 
---

I mean, as a 8 year old kid I wasn't suuuper invested in PEGI 18 stuff BUT I remember the schoolyard of the 3. grade... do you too?  
---
Yeah karma is a bad system. Dudes can game it with alt accounts, or just buy 1 stim off someone. I got burned on a trade by a guy with almost 40 karma.
---
WIt I can make my head a fucking mothman head?
---
Just to show you how I dealt with this question. First I basically made all points 7 on each one. Then as I played I could see where I wanted to put more and where I needed less :) 
---
"Were just put up against a wall and shot".... really? That’s your comparison? 
---
Is this fixed yet? Sometimes you fully repair the power plant and a corresponding power box stops getting the full power benefit. 
---
Thanks for the clarification. 
---
create a new event type: starve the people. Completing it robs all players of 2 dog food. Naturally, Rose is the one that gives it to you
---
Wtf kinda stupid post is this? This sub really has fallen... 
---
This simply can not be because that guy posted the other day casuals aren't effected by the majority of the stuff we complain about and we are just try-hards!1!!1
---
good idea
---
Just drink a few bottles of alcohol and overwrite whatever addiction it is. Yes, you can only have one active addiction... 
---
Take Party Boy/ Girl, one bottle will fill 50% of your hydration bar (significantly better than purified water). Whiskey gives you 30 carry weight, great for fast travelling in combination with Radicool and Psychobuff when you're overencumbered.
---
Addictol is too rare though. The rarest drug in the wastes by my collection. 
---
You got banned im guessing in a wave related to duping that looks at item account numbers over a time. Unless they specifically told you it was embarrassing a player, it was probably duping
---
me too thanks
---
No i can do math on your perks, you only need 9 str, per, int and agi  to get every damage weps perks leaving 20 perks to enhance your char after that....   
---
This would not help separate the builds, it would destroy them. 
---
It was clear as day you were lying about not abusing the system when you got banned.
---
Haha I guess your right. Maybe I was just shocked to see that high of lvl
---
ok
---
During fights on PC none of my hot keys register, basically I have to set up everything first inc health then hope it all lasts, I can turn my back to enemies and walk a bit that seems to release the key binds but obviously I'm being hits in the back. The game engine seems to get overloaded and craps out.
---
ps4..😢
---
I got rid of 30% (of of 40) by deleting everything, building some foundations (still 40 %), storing them and placing them again. Somewhere betweet those steps my budget went down. I still have 10% stored budget, but I also have a living sloth so I don't know if that is how it is intended. Also don't know what exactly was the trigger that deleted the phantom budget.
---
Let me know if you try it and if it worked pls.
---
bug... if you have a paper doggy bag on the floor and you fast travel they will be taken off and put inside the doggy bag. (sometimes) happened to me 3 times.
---
You're over-thinking it. Stuff like flat screen panels ruins the retro pre-WWII Americana aesthetic that's part of the charm of the Fallout universe.
---
Or just make it a card upgradeable that only costs 1 point 
---
i do like gow sometimes you get a pip on the enemy from the recon scope, and how sometimes that pip states long after the enemy is dead and looted... but it only works sometimes!!!!
---
really wish the pip would disappear after it is looted..
---
Mel Bernstein is this toon's inspiration. Sadly until there are plans for mannequins that role playing potential of this toon is sadly limited.  
---
Its amazing all you had to do was make a post about you getting banned and say you did nothing wrong.

---
nah, that retro technology, steep in 50's Americana feel has always been the aesthetic for Fallout as a franchise, it's a stylistic choice, though they do have some random flimsy explanations for why those kinds of technology aren't widespread. That being said, Fallout: New Vegas DID have holograms and shit (that could walk, talk and even shoot at you) in a couple of the DLCs (Dead Money and Old World Blues)
---
What if I told you I don’t believe you?
---
Ok, I can believe that maybe you didn't know in advance about the perk levels needed. 
---
I can believe that you are over-perked for crafting too.
---
But complaining that you didn't put enough points into INT, and that it's somehow not your  fault?
---
Maybe put a few points into IRL INT?
---
Last night I kept seeing a notice that I was dodging attacks yet I don’t have that perk card slotted. I think there are some odd things taking place in the code base regarding perks and mutations. 
---
!remindme 6 hours
---
Yeah he probably did constant whitespring nuke runs before they nerfed the exp. I got to lvl 69 in one day on one of my alts that's how good the xp was over there.
---
Have been wanting this day one.
---
Omg plans for mannequins is a whole diff convo that could be scary....friend at your base the go to workshop and weeping angel his was with them
---
&gt;You can get serums for as low as 500 caps
---
never less than 4000 for me
---
Hmm that does sound cool, how do you find it outside of team play? Or do you have a different character for solo play? 
---
No problem with it. I'm just curious how much damage my Bloodied Heavy weapon does compared to others. Adrenaline inflates the numbers.
---
Personally they need to rework the whole system and make every item selectable by the player to allow autoscrap or not....
---
so your not into saving beer bottles or baseballs, great auto scrap them... 
---
I can confirm that I had that happen again yesterday *after* the hotfix. 
---
Lmao organised internet trolls did not torpedo this game... bethesda did there isn’t a conspiracy here...
---
Well if it's just an average dude with a plank I get it. Most of the melee you see running around have an entire build centered around melee. I'm pretty well optimized with a full set of unyielding, bloodied fist, and every beneficial mutation and perk. Running around at 20% health, I'm a glass cannon. I die more than you can imagine. It's not viable in a nuke zone. It's very very specialized and still, unless I hop myself up on every drug/food and get a sneak attack, I'm not one shotting a SB. 
---
I compare my melee experience with when I throw on some power armor, let myself heal to 100% health, swap a few perks and just rip face with a 1 star Furious Prime Gatling gun... Takes no effort and I never die.
---
My friend plays a vats sniper. That's OP in PVP. With a bloodied gauss and full unyielding, I cannot kill him unless I use a stealth boy. During PVE, all my armor breaks because I'm getting hit. My bud just sits back and vats crit/gun fu everything from range like it's nothing.
---
Trades offs... There are trade offs to being a very strong melee. The only thing that was really unbalanced was TSE, and they over nerfed it.
---
Its because they never invented a micro processor and just used nuke power instead 
---
tenderize 
---
bloody mess
---
adrenaline perk
---
adrenal mutation
---
alcohol for str and .... 
---
AND NO BIG SALADS!

Rest in peace Fallout 76

Biggest word of advice avoid pvp unless you know you can hurt them no need to lose a ton of caps over an idiot with a deathclaw gauntlet
---
I live under the bridge by the train station at the Top of the World. One day I decided I was tired of living in the dark ages and built some lights and a generator to power them. My super mutant neighbours up the hill were not impressed.
---
Thus started a tit for tat war between us. I built some artillery in the end. Best choice I made! So satisfying doing some crafting while hearing my artillery landing on them 50 metres away. It's not super effective but it's certainly capable of killing a few mobs and softening some others. 
---
I think I heard someone claim you can build 6/8 of them if you depend the entire budget. I can guarantee that would be overkill for my intended purposes!
---
Nah, there busy buffing energy weapons. So in a couple of month's when there all buffed up that'll be the weapons they want us to test...erm i mean play as!
---
Don't go switching builds for melee characters, make a new one. Or prey that Bethesda actually offer a respec with the next buffs / nerfs.
---
People downvoting this guy seem to be missing the point:
---
If no-one was getting banned before, then yes, no innocents would be getting banned, so we'd only start seeing innocents complaining of getting banned after the bans started. It doesn't have to be a conspiracy connection that all the "innocent" people are lying.
---
That said, I didn't believe them either, but it's a stupid reason to claim there's a connection. 0 bans, 0 complaints of false bans, becomes some bans, some complaints of false bans; what's supposed to be suspicious there?
---
Go with silenced automatic rifles. They deal enough damage as is. Legendary effects are just a bonus although Furious/Two Shot can really help you out.
---
I don't really mess with PVP at this time. Looking more for PVE advice.
---
Agreed.
---
Thanks! Appreciate the help :)
---
Interesting. Good to know, thanks :)
---
So far the rng gods have blessed me with the following:
---
 Ghoul slayer gamma gun

Bloodied assaultron head

Nocturnal rolling pin
---
&gt;Light is at the end of the tunnel
---
Please explain, where is the light coming from? We have nothing but disappointments coming from Beth. Every patch introduces new problems, shooting over the target or bringing back bugs and issues. There are still really cheap to fix things not even mentioned like a way to tell your power armor chassis apart, for example. 
---
Beth stil has not understood that we don't play the game like they want us to, but still try to make us. There is no piece of communication showing that they understood how serious the situation is and what they plan to do about it. If I look around the last few days I cannot find a single piece of information that this game is not dead very soon. 
---
Project leadership is nowhere to be found, no Pete , no Todd. There are just a few poor CMs who are bearing the anger of the fans, giving us reassurances that the show must go on or something. Meanwhile the fans are not hopping servers, they are hopping to other games.
---
A weekly state of the game the division style would really help....
---
where did you find the hood?
---
Maybe if this was a subreddit for the whole Fallout series like the Assassin's Creed sub. But this sub is specifically for FO76. A more clever thing to do would be to convert this sub into discussion of the pip-boy games within FO76.
---
I have watched my artillery on occasions pausing to turn slighting before resuming the barrage. No idea why... Either a bug, or one of my lawn flamingos/wires is clipping slightly with the mesh?
---
I just wish they removed perk swapping completely or made it more difficult. To me it's more fun to play with friends if we have different specialisations and maybe one of us can open locks while the other can hack. Everyone doing everything really removes the feeling of teamwork.
---
*Strange in numbers - *Is still bugged and will often supress mutation effects if a mutated member leaves the team. 
---
*Herd mentality, magnetic personality, and unyielding armor unshares cards - * If you charisma is buffed by any of these effects, the card will often be unshared. This happens with unyielding armor most often upon death (despite respawning with low enough health to have more than sufficient charisma) or fast traveling. 
---
*Chainsaws and supersledges break stealth when equipped - *With over 25 agility and other buffs to sneak (perks, legendary armor, armor mods), these two weapons will immediately alert enemies when equipped. 
---
*Addictions are unviewable - * Only once have I seen that I was addicted to a drug and it's corresponding debuffs. I use a lot of drugs. I should be suffering from addiction/withdrawl all the time. Because I can never be sure of what I'm addicted to, the junkie's legendary prefix is useless. This needs a fix.
---
Wow that's great!
---
&gt;It's just a game, you can stop playing anytime. No need to cry on reddit.
---
\* Proceeds to cry on Reddit \*
---
Yup, you nailed it
---
The two-shot nerf was legitimately way too much, though. It's now one of the weakest benefits *and* it wrecks the accuracy so you can't hit anything easily - two-shot on its own was quite well balanced before, and just the explosive nerf would've brought it into line.
---
At 25% just about any other of the good effects is objectively better - armour piercing will pretty much always gain more than that, and bloodied does 50% bonus at 2/3 health - people will get that much bonus just from *forgetting to radaway* on the regular. And those don't have any downside and can spawn with the explosive mod too.
---
To make TS have any point whatsoever they either need to restore its full damage, or up it to 33-50% and massively reduce the accuracy penalty. Otherwise it's utterly pointless, as someone with multiple legit two-shot weapons.
---
No one cares.

I play HW build, I craft 4-8K 50 cal rounds every day. I have never been banned. I'm also a high INT crafter who collects plans.
---
I also horde ammo because it is weightless for me. I have over 10K 45 ammo just in case I use a combat rifle :) 45 always spawns next to the 5.56 so I grab both, I have a hand made for garbage mobs that I don't want to waste 50 cal ammo on.
---
I have not been banned.
---
Interesting, thanks for sharing.
---
Now I want to just skip all DR stacking and instead just grab 5 pieces with the unique mod "receive 15% less damage while standing still".
---
Yeah i accidentally fed the machine all my shotgun shells.. not happy...
---
now i carefully feed the machine and not just spam the "E" button to put every thing in

I can do it now I have all paints

Or more likely an outsourced offshore codeshop in india or somewhere.

What's it matter they already have our money... 
---
Help what? At least the people “crying” about the game are people trying to help make the game better. You’re just bitching to bitch. 
---
Don't worry Beth we never believed the bs.
---
I know your pain, I have a one hand build, been trying for the instigating combat knife with +40% power attack for a sneak build, got a pitch fork... 
---
But i did get the furious +40% attack speed guitar sword +1 str, Its does nice damage, but just love knowing my best wep so far is a joke wep.  
---
Its not.
---
That part would be nice too. I only worry about the response time of switching weapons and perks, that’s why I didn’t include it at first. 
---
This is exactly where the game broke for me, and where I finally broke and quit playing the game. The game froze three separate times on the transponder quest. . . Finally finished that only to get to the end of the glassed cavern and actually kill the SB, but have the game crash out literally as I'm walking to get the holotape. Did the quest again, but now a second SB magically spawned into the cave. I was decimated. Did the quest a third time, only to have the game freeze when I got to the end. When I loaded back in it was telling me I had to do the transponder quest again. . . No thank you sir, I'm a casual gamer and I don't have time for that. . . Let me know if they ever fix those bugs, maybe I'll give the game a try again. They probably won't though. I'm still pissed about this.

I was offered 500 atoms after complaining about preordering for access to the B.ET.A but being unable to play it because they never mentioned (On Amazon) that it was a limited time deal.
---
I legit didn't notice them add the 500 Atoms. It was early days and I was earning 80 Atoms left and right from generous challenges. They pointed that out to me and I felt like a fool!
---
Of course, I did notice the 2000 atoms they added when I queried why some people on Reddit were being offered different quantities of Atoms...
---
They took your brothers money :) epic win.

I've gotten 2 instigating explosive shotguns (1 double barrel, 1 combat), 1 stalker's explosive shotgun, 1 beserker's explosive shotgun, 1 anti-armor explosive shotgun, an explosive revolver, an explosive laser rifle, 2 bloodied+swing speed 2 handed melee weapons, at least 4 of the same type but 1 handed, 1 suppressor's explosive mini-gun, a quad+50% crit damage handmade, a stalker's +crit damage +crit fill combat rifle, 2 two shot fatman's, 3 anti-armor missile launchers....
---
Plenty of great tier drops inside of 250 levels, but I was actually playing the game in a way that increased the likelihood I would get these. If you play the game like you're trying to farm lead and plastic, you'll get that. If you play the game like you're trying to get tags on legendaries and farming for drops non-stop, you get drops. I don't get better drops, I just get more rolls. Play the odds often enough, and you'll get something
---
&gt; Ghoul slayer gamma gun 
---
LOL! Just the thing for an anti-player feral ghoul medic build.
---
you posted bc you're an asshole 
---
So..i also finished the main questline wiht the nuke and started to wonder: what to do next? Answer: nothing. The buildlimit for ur home is so small its pointless to farm stuff and look for plans for any kind of expansion. The low carryweight makes it so u can only use one or 2 preferred guns at a time. U may also try the MMO way of going to places to hunt and try ur luck in finding some useful weapon or gear. If u think that is the most important thing to do ofc, to me its boring. Me i just decided that this game is done now, ca 100-130 hours played or so. not sure. Im returning to Fallout 4 which Outclasses Fallout 76 by far, and i already have ca 1400 hours and ca 7 different playthroughs done. The most fun thing about fallout 76? the combat against harder oponents, the moleminers are my new fav with their heavy  breathing. Also i thought the environment was beautiful at some places, yet this game is so outclassed by Kingdom come deliverance when it comes to graphix (then again its the prettiest game today). The WORST things about this game: NO NPC! it made the game feel completely like one big dungeon, u against the world of monsters and everyone else is dead. To me the whole multiplayer aspect just broke immersion when someone runs past u waves says hello then moves on, unless hes a troll hunting other players for scrap items. and that was it. i played it solo and enjoyed those 100 hours none the less. No reason to put any effort into ur CAMP since the build limit was way too low. No people to care about but urself. Everything is about looking for better gear and thats it. Incredibly boring. I bought the game on sale (thank god) and it felt its worth ca 20-30 euros or so. But i mean seriously, the game is just so much worse then Fallout 4 its ridicilous. The mods improved so many aspects of the settlement system u found a reason to haul junk, build stuff, help settlers and ppl to find a new way of life. Establishing supplylines, Artillery strikes and different factions with ppla u all started to care about. All those things are out the window for the pleasure of hunting for better gear with other people tahts only breaking the immersion of the game and its whole world. I guess its gonna be skyrim and fallout 4 untill Elder scrolls 6 arrives, even if i am somewhat curious about starfield. I doubt it will make me feel as spellbound by the forests of skyrim, or the fight to rebuild a habitable life in Fallout 4. So, thank u Bethesda for those 100 hours o play, but this is too boring compared to what the modding community has done with Fallout 4. Am i the only one thinking like this or do u think im just the wrong type of player for the game?  And now....4 hours of reinstalling and setting up mods for fallout 4, then starting a new playthrough of Fallout 4. Ad Victorian

That’s awesome if so. Way too many cheaters out there 
---
In their minds they banned him for a reason, the same reason they don't want him playing any more of their games... 
---
Could be a blessing in disguise given the current trajectory of the company.
---
Username checks out. And I think he could care less, he’s half my age and rich as shit
---
It's kinda ridiculous how much they ban innocent people yet the hackers still flood it. I know so many people playing legit who did get banned - including someone who lagged badly then got insta-banned for supposedly teleporting - yet open lobbies are unplayable on PC because apparently the hackers have figured out how to hide it from the servers, and the servers only notice when the hackers affect innocents.
---
xD
---
"Warning: the frustration caused by trying to kill enemies may be harmful to young children"
---
Can you still make one? I would really like having one :P
---
Bethesda, not only energy weapons need a buff but ALL the heavy weapons need one as well. Except for the Gatling gun, all the other heavy weapons need DURABILItY and DMG increase. I run a heavy gun build and I’m tired of carrying two of each weapon, so I can play without running to a repair every 5 minutes. I’m also having to double craft the amount of ammo as before. Dmg has to be increased or the amount of bullets we craft must be tippled. We should be able to use the base weapons without worrying about a legendary effects. Currently they are really bad compared to other weapons.
---
Since I’m carrying more weapons of the same “type”, after PATCH 5, I can no longer set them in favorite tab together. If I have two equal weapons., the game seems to not knowing the difference and therefore don’t let it be set in the favorite tab.
---
Ty, for reading our comments. And I do hope u actually do something, about ALL the heavy weapons, and PISTOLs of this game.
---
fuck every single one of those assholes, and the pathetic morons who defend them (quartering &amp; wong) 
---
The time line in the fallout universe split from ours in the late 50's early 60's  - After the first use of a nuclear bomb in war, our reality began to shun nuclear power after seeing the results of it's use in war.  In the fallout universe, everything atomic was embraced, the transistor was never invented and computers remained large, bulky devices that ran on vacuum tubes and relays.  Society seemed to freeze in the mass consumption Americana heyday that was the late 50's, where every diner and cafe looked a living Norman Rockwell painting. 
---
Meanwhile, other forms of technology continued to advance, medical, science, robotics, all went ahead full steam, but  due to rampant inefficient manufacturing and mass consumption of resources, wars began springing up over resources.  Fossil fuels became rare, wars caused changes in leadership across the globe, countries were annexed, and gobbled up by their neighboring nations. 
---
Towards the end, more and more people were needed to fight the wars, causing governments and businesses across the country to begin replacing their human workforce with robots. This resulted in even more civil unrest as workers found themselves out of jobs, the environment awash in toxic byproducts from industry, and natural resources growing more and more scarce. 
---
The only real industry left for the average Joe, was the military, but it had a very high likelihood of the soldier being killed in the fighting, at least until the power armor came into play.
---
Anyway, things came to a head in 2077, no one is really sure who launched first, fan theories abound, anything from China, to Aliens, and one theory even has Vault Tec behind it all.

TLDR; - The fallout universe is a retro-future, think society stuck in the 1950's while their technology progressed along an analog route, instead of a digital one.

Except proof of that was shown, the slap mechanic has a fixed damage cap that cannot be bypassed. People getting one-shot in pacifist didn't realise they were no longer in pacifist because they had a workshop; like the messagebox says, *this puts you in PvP mode*, and disables the slap mechanic whenever you're near the workshop. You do full damage to everyone not on your team and they do full damage to you.
---
My usual 17+ caps from above the whitesprings service entrance was reduced to 1 cap.  That doesn't even qualify as a stash.

Glad I uninstalled this mess.

Please respond to people's ban appeals with yes or no, and unlink banned console accounts. What I'm reading is that there are a lot of people in limbo, some for months now, and they can't even unlink their console accounts (and therefore can never buy any future Bethesda games) or submit a ticket asking for an update. My friend is even willing to buy another copy of Fallout 76 but cannot do so because his PlayStation cannot be unlinked. You are banning all future sales, even if single player console games.
---
That's there fix?  Such a lazy half assed attempt.  
---
If you have 500k of one item and die, would you drop 150k of it? Legitimate question, Cuz if so that could cause a problem. 
---
No it wasn't. Just stop believing bull shit and hoping on the hate train.
---
Shouldn't you be crying over some peice together lyrics.
---
Probably better to just look at the contents of the bag and leave them, report the player stating what they had on them and leave it at that.  
---
Not nearly as satisfying but at least your account is safe
---
Yes game needs more spots with lots of enemies imo
---
Yeah there's a huge difference now. I've always been a sneak character since Fallout 1. I'm starting to wonder if this is just a nerf they sneaked in (pun not intended) that went over the top. 
---
I'm getting real tired.
---
Why was your friend banned?
---
I'd just like to see other legendary effects get more powerful buffs. Make it so hunter's/zealot's/ghoul slayer's do marginally more damage than furious's max buff/anti-armor but less than executioner. Keep it so two-shot continues to be unreliable for VATs and Crits so there's a trade off. Make it so if I'm specialized in one weapon type I have to tactically choose when to use different weapons.
---
Vanilla fo4 had square crop planters.  Bet your bottom cap it will be an atom store feature.  
---
Even then, if you get flagged they said they look at behavior and would see you aquired it through other players trading
---
Breaking down unusable ammo to craft usable would be a huge plus to it as well.
---
I'd much rather believe any player than any Beth employee at this point. Bethesda is tone deaf and has been caught lying before, not to mention their unfulfilled bullshit promises and flat out lies they advertised fo76 with. 
---
Wonder what Juicehead will say about this, given that he's been the "people's champion" regarding the reporting of people getting unfairly banned and still insisting that this is still the case.
---
There will be a skill soon i atom shop for 4000 atoms . "Kill enemies you engage" 😂
---
Where did you get the outfit?
---
That was the most Fallouty insult Ive heard thus far
---
Like bethesda has never said anything untrue before.... hmmmm.....

I came across a Mega Sloth fighting off two Yao Guai on the putting green just south of Whitespring. Just stayed perched on the cliff side, through a couple rounds into each of them to get some XP, and took out the remaining Yao Guai after the fight. Only time I've seen the Megasloth there, but I'll keep looking to see if it is a spawn point. Usually I get chased off by an Alpha Deathclaw.
---
This happen with me but with the repair armor perk card in luck. The thing is I do not have this card.
---
I like using unyielding armor pieces along with the adrenal reaction.
---
I said about Fallout76.

(What was the lie about the rum again?)

I use Adrenal so guess its not super helpful but my bloodied explosive .50cal is doing around the mid 300s? My bloodied gatling laser with charging barrel does 285 but that slow firerate is balls with charging.
---
yes, i think they dont play this game that much to know.
---
They probably think there are some way even tho they never put them into the game....
---
but there arent

---
That’s your personal problem. It says so much about you.
---
The guy is lying. Bethesda has spoken out about these false claims of banning. Just like all the lies about f2p that was going around.
---
But hey, you believe what you want. Be a negative person. Your life must be so amazing.
---
You shilled your younger brother out to Bethesda, it just get better. You're either too poor to pay for it yourself, or like others to play for you... who's the real bitch? And by the sound of it  you're heavily autistic, much like 98% of this sub, hence all the constantly screeching. 
---
Well, everything died really easy in survival mode too. You died easily too. It was like every body had TSE. You didn't worry about wasting 1000 rounds in a fight, you worried whether you could find another 30 rounds and whether the 42 you had on you was enough to get you through the current run of the quest line. 
---
This "survival lite" version is just spongey enemies that work up an appetite and thirst. It's completely different and shouldn't be likened to the current game
---
Are you just going to follow people around commenting on their replies because you have a personal issue with Bethesda that only exists in your head?
---
Get some professional help.
---
Cost doesnt equal to rank. Lone Wanderer begins with a cost of 2, takes 3 cards to max
---
TSE weapons are still doing like 400+ damage. They are still up there as the strongest guns in the game. Only now, instead of being 10x stronger than anything else, they are
---
This is a valid question dont know why you were downvoted.  
---
I said to another person who asked this:  
---
&gt;Probably better to just look at the contents of the bag and leave them, report the player stating what they had on them and leave it at that.
---
sounds fair
---
honestly I just need some hecking springs
---
and getting my ultracite PA back might be nice
---
I know for certain that I had it
---
It's meant to work that way. The first level of the card takes 2 perk slots.
---
r/brandnewsentence 
---
Yes cause bethesda has always told us only the truth huh? Like how this game would be functional and stable and that they would listen to player feedback and only put pure cosmetics to the atom shop? Thx, but I will take everything bethesda has to say from now on with a huge grain of salt. 
---
they would also be able to see that you just loaded into that world and were immediately in the "restricted area" though
---
If it’s junk you’d lose 500k of it 
---
Oh I see, didn't realise that. Is there another card that works this way? I always that that cost and level would match.. Huh very interesting thanks for clearing it up. 
---
&gt; Enemies can detect you much easier when sneaking. Before patch you could walk in front of them without being noticed 
---
 With 14 AGI (w/out buffs) and maxed sneak it feels exactly like it did when leveling up:  Ouch time inc. Please revert to pre-patch sneaky time.

Same happens to r/guildwars2 .
---
Have you managed to learn the Polished mod for the torso? I scrapped 10 torsos in a row with no luck. It's the last mod I need (I think). Had given up, hoping to find a plan instead xD
---
Thanks for the downvote. No clue why though :) 
---
If you were in game with a duper, you'd only be in with them once and then get a new session without them. The dupe bugs that affected server stability *required* the server to *crash outright*, booting everyone to main menu, else the duplication wouldn't happen.
---
I would bet that pirates used em way back in the 1200's, it's not like its a difficult concept.
---
He was banned for duping, although as he explained in his appeal, he had stopped as soon as he learned that this was causing server instability and was playing with a normal inventory (yet was still banned several weeks later), and was more than willing to have his character or inventory wiped just to be able to play again. What I don't understand is why they wouldn't want even banned players to be able to buy future Bethesda games. He was a devoted Fallout 3, 4 and Skyrim player, but apparently can't buy future games without a new console and PlayStation account? Us PC players can just make a new account and buy whatever, so it seems strange to exclude console sales, even for those that would even buy the game a second time after being banned.
---
A cheater could possible garner a way to get their account back, Bethesda will probably lose a customer to wrongfully ban someone
---
I can deal more damage melee now, but it is definitely with it's limitations. I can't take out mobs of 15 in 5 seconds running melee. I can't strike from relative safety. My current build can be killed easily with slap damage alone. 
---
rofl, you are doing the same.... get some help buddy, I'm here laughing at you, trying to take a corporation's side against its players and believing that you will make the game better with it when in all honesty ppl like you are just the problem. It's because of ppl like you that Beth even thought they can release fo76 in a state that they did. But w/e man, accuse all the players raising issues of lying and go back to being Bethesda's puppet, I give zero fucks. ;) :) 
---
I thought you only lost a portion of your junk?
---
That is some conspiracy theory level logic
---
Exactly, and the "duper hunters" actually had to find a way to deal as much damage or more as dupers stacking bobbles, with high-tier weapons :\^)  
---
People who got banned be like : "I was hunting dupers and dropped their inventories deep in rivers and lakes, I swearz"  
---
Also the same people : \*posts a link to their youtube page, has uploaded own content showing them cheating, griefing and stacking bobbleheads, looting other dupers\*  
---
Reddit people : looks fine to us, they'z iNnOcEnT !§!§bbqoneone
---
A fatwoman?  Fatmolly?
---
I get this too.   This one doesn't phase me much.  But having the wrong ammo for the gun they have is jarring to me.
---
True.  But this could be kid that got banned.  5 years later he has a job, more disposable income and matured.  Yet his account will still be banned.  There is no logic in this.  
---
More of a philosophical question, but does it matter if a player cheats in a single player game as long as they paid for it and enjoy it anyway?
---
Was reintroduced with hot January hot fix, FO76 seems to crash the video driver, screen revert to basic low resolution then after 30 seconds will flash back to my normal screen res when the nvidia drivers have reset, restarted.

---
If duping never happened, it should've been that strong. However, it's very easy to find TSE weapons now. I used to use them as currency when I was at cap max. And I'm just an armor trader that farms his drops at whitesprings. Likewise, it's relatively easy to find bloodied/anti-armor explosive weapons now.

You lose any junk on your person at time of death

That could be a major problem

Oh trust me, if the most important thing I ever learnt from playing on a PSX and PS2 was that losing a block of data on a mem card and starting from scratch in a game I put hours into sucks BIG TIME! So I’ve avoided anything that could reset or ban me ever since playing online.
---
Yes.  You can (caps lock / C) to WALK, default is RUNNING, Shift is SPRINT.  It is not very clear in game.
---
bigboi stuff
---
"Shouldnt running be the same as sprinting?"
---
No, they are different. Most perk cards affect run speed, although there is one that increases sprint speed when below 40/50% hp.
---
It's probably just me, but BGS will always be BattleGar Stalactica.
---
Lifegiver has an innate base of 2 while some cards have just 1 rank but with a cost of 2 (Awareness 
---
 Field Surgeon, etc) or 3 (Professional Drinker)

You can visit this [Build Planner](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=) to explore the perk cards and ofcourse, to plan your build if you want
---
Not really, as then they're only cheating/effecting themselves.
---
When their actions or the results of their actions effect or can potentially effect other players directly or indirectly, then it becomes an issue.
---
&gt;  I have another character that I pay legitimately on anyway.
---
You know its an account ban not a character ban right?
---
This guy gets it. Not everyone needs to be perfect at everything like Skyrim or something.
---
I personally have lockpicking always equipped and don't use hacking, unless I'm doing a missile silo. 
---
I might be autistic because I can’t understand any of the bullshit you’re spewing 
---
Yes, and when choosing between perk cards its one of the sorting options (2 point cards, 3 point cards etc)
---
How is that a problem. The 500K of junk has no merit and shouldn’t even exist.
---
I finished it fine on my main. Just wanted to go through again, but when it crashes, I spawn outside and lose everything. I think I'll leave it alone for now. I can just craft ultracite for my character and move on. It's weird though. When I go in to farm, it has no issue. Maybe it's the transponder quest?
---
so far ive had alot more encounters in blast zones of getting killed by griefers than nice people
---
Thanks. I have played the game +400h and never saw that. Appreciate your help :) 
---
so you go in a game craft and destroy stuff for mods and get banned so you are saying that is perfectly fine ?
---
The problem is if you pick it up and get tagged as a duper. They gotta have some metric to track that I hope. 
---
Created and scraped 50 handguns and no banning
---
I mean its been that way since day 1 and was something that was up front, kinda the main reason for stash boxes
---
I never worked with this builder. But thank you for pointing it out :) after many hours playing this will actually help me if I want to make a new Charakter. :) 
---
While Fallout has a lot of splaining to do, Bethesda publishes several other licenses like Rage, Doom, and Wolfenstein that are not necessarily affected by such problems. We will all be cautious about the next games from Bethesda studios, but maybe less so for a Id and Avalanche titles.
---
I find I need 3. One for ranged combat, one for armor crafting/ repair, one for gun repair, one for ammo repair, one for melee combat... oh wait that’s 5. 
---
HOW WAS THIS NOT OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE DON’T want to spend 10% OF THEIR PLAY TIME IN A @#$&amp;ING MENU.??
---
Oh god the memory card days of gaming were horrible, I remember not having enough save space so you had to decide what to get rid of before you could save your GTA Vice City progress
---
Most likely as drops. If you nuke it (how I got milt drop) or go to the golf course you most likely will find one
---
Honestly. All of you who are still playing this game, you are very much part of the problem.
---
So people shouldn't "hate" on this game for everything that's wrong with Bethesda or the general gaming fuckups of recent? Look dude the whole mess started with Bethesda announcing that they're doing a beta mere days before launch despite it being their first online attempt while also knowing that their games have been buggy as fuck. It played out exactly as people had feared it would. Now you can say it's "hating" on the game but people have been telling Bethesda that it doesn't "just work". The reasonable thing to do would've been to delay the game by a couple months to fix the issues while also actually testing their patches as opposed to what we have now. But Bethesda didn't care that it was a buggy mess and at that point...well it was just another confirmation on what people expected would happen. Now the outside fuckups were something people certainly didn't expect. I mean we knew Bethesda was lazy but we didn't think that they would be this cheap.
---
What this game or rather Bethesda needs is a proper fucking wakeup call. Cause if Starfield or TES:VI don't have proper QA work...well it's gonna be a mess. But then again people have been telling to get a grip all the way back with Oblivion and so far they're still delivering the same buggy messes. And thankfully the people are finally starting to realize it now that Bethesda has been skating by for all these years on the goodwill of the modding community that fixed the shit Bethesda didn't bother to do.
---
I wasn't referring to the guy dropping it, but the guy picking it up. It's also been a while since I died
---
I was hoping plans for PA mods would craft the mod itself so the mod could be traded.  I don't know how I feel handing a stranger my PA legs to install calibrated shocks.
---
Says the guy who made an account to harass people who play a game he doesn't like.
---
Good to know it's been discovered and hopefully will be resolved soon.
---
So the question remains, why ban them from the purchase of single player games? I think that's what has happened whether they realize it or not.
---
They can. Dev room items were removed from inventories of people who hadn't been in there when this first started going around; however, it's not worth the effort of investigating every single person who claims they lost some ammo to a glitch, which will be demanded if they give in to *any* person asking items to be restored. They hold it back for only when they need it to force some fixes in, not for the whims of singular people.
---
Never pays to cheat. As far as I'm concerned he got what he deserved. 
---
Sad thing is it he probably won't learn a lesson from this.
---
Ive had an adverse effect of slowly taking damage
---
candem park 
---
That's not a bug. Loot is randomized. You don't necessarily get the weapon they were using.
---
This may sound rude but I dont mean in to be:
---
Read the perk cards, it tells you what they do. If you think you know a perk because of fallout 4 then I would re-read it in fallout 76. Scrapper for example only gives extra steel/wood no screws etc.
---
I'm full on glass cannon and saying it needs to get nerfed lacks any understanding of what the play style demands. There's much more aid micromanagement to get those numbers up. It's spurts of high damage accompanied by long periods of waiting for respawn. To make it feasible, you really need to find the right equipment to make it work.
---
390/1010 here with pistols killing robots and I'm NOT a pistol user!
---
ikr..lol..collateral...
---
They've proven they have the ability; dev room items were deleted from inventories the patch after that started going around. They just don't want to have to deal with any old person demanding items they may or may not have lost or even had in the first place being restored, so policy-wise they "don't have the ability".
---

---
I wish there was a "talk sense" option for the super mutants. I'm all for joining everybody together that can be joined together. We'd have a better America if we did that. Feral ghouls are just ghouls that ended up being isolated and hated too long. We prevent that, we have no ferals, just some awesome people. Same with the super mutants. 
---
They have dog friends for crying out loud. They're fine with companions they just need brainwashed back into being a little more forgiving of weaker humans. Have you ever really looked at one? Their clothing is super sad and they usually have bandages on their feet instead of shoes because they're so big. Makes me sad there's no unity anywhere. We all share something together.
---
Yeah but you still want to know how many are needed in each. Like if I'm using a rifle build I'm going to probably want at least 9 in Perception. But if I'm melee I won't need that much there but could put it in Strength instead. I think what they're saying is have a build idea in mind. Then from there you can swap as needed. Like most Intelligence perks  are situational and don't need to be equipped the whole time.
---
This was my first camp location. I kept spawning inside the rocks when I'd load in.
---
I have altogether stopped lock-picking anything  over level 0.   Cant stand needing to go into my perks every 5 mins.   Is this what you intended Bethesda?
---
Ultimately we just need perk loadouts we can switch between within seconds. If they're worried about potential gameplay imbalances with people being able to instantly switch from one damage dealing build to another and the advantages that could bring, then put a short cooldown on the switching for 30 seconds or a minute or something. I wouldn't mind if such a system had it's own quick menu wheel or bar, like double tapping up on the d-pad on console could open it. It would be such a giant QoL change. At the very least I want 3 loadouts. 1 for crafting, 1 for traveling, and 1 for combat.
---
I thought dead pets respawn periodically.  Have you not seen that?
---
Ok sorry. I get it. I read that like you were worried about losing a ton of junk. Haha!
---
Yes, you're pointing at an "anticheat automatedd ban wave" due to a false-positive MD5 checksum, it's litteraly miles away from DETECTING FROM LOGS AND STATS that players had more than 150k (if reported by players) or 500k RARE items and AUTOMATICALLY BAN THEM.  
---
There's legit no real-world possibility for someone to have 500k of one specific RARE item when the game is MERELY 3-4 months old (a bit more including B.E.T.A).  
---
You just posted an exception (that has a totally different origin / cause) trying to make it into a "ho look, it already happened" thing.

Well given that the support doesn't even have any tools to fix in game issues with your characters(deleted items/characters) i am honestly not surprised that the don't have logs running for these kinds of things espacially after the realized that their game economy is getting destroyed by dupers.
---
Will soon be in atom shop 
---
He didn't. But too many people would invent anything to badmouth the game and company.
---
Nah, dupers get fucked, that shit taxes the servers hard and is preventing a player driven economy. Just don't wanna catch some assholes ban for him
---
I'll have a look.
---
This makes zero sense to me. Are you just looking for things to be pissed at in your life? What would a duper or hatet say? Think a bit.
---
No, I'm saying that "literally unplayable" means that you can't play it in any way, that the game doesn't boot up, for any players. Which means that you don't know what "literally unplayable" means.
---
I don't know what happened to you and your ban, but considering the way you tell others that the game is "literally unplayable", you seem like you did things other than scrapping for mods that got you banned.
---
Why am I still not banned after crafting and scrapping around 700 combat armor pieces in a couple of days for mods? If you really think you didn't deserve the ban, like, if you seriously didn't do anything to deserve it. You should be contacting support regarding the ban and ask for the reason you got banned and ask for it to get lifted. Instead you are here claiming the game is "literally unplayable", an outright lie, and that you got banned for scrapping stuff for mods.
---
Dev room items were deleted from inventories of people who hadn't been there - because they could tell the difference - a while back, and only the people who had been there were banned. There shouldn't be any dev room items around now but it's possible some people are hacking their way in again and dropping the items for people, knowing they'll be banned. The main things to avoid, however unlikely it is to find them now:
---
Facshnacht masks
---
Marine tactical helmet (the one that looks like actual armour instead of part of a swimsuit)
---
"Pristine" costumes
---
can confirm this. my sneak/stealth was totaly useless.  after i cured worms and did what you did, it was okayish again. thx
---
I really don't see how Bethesda expects to keep a player base by doing this. They're doing it to both PC and PS4 players, chances are they're doing it with XBox as well.
---
 Just think about it, the idea that, even mistakenly, you can be locked out of all past, and future purchases from this company. Where is the incentive to risk future purchases with them? 
---
I certainly don't want to risk spending hundreds of dollars on games, only to spin the wheel every time I play, and risk getting a ban for some random thing, only to lose everything I've bought from them.
---
And make no mistake, this is very intentional on their part, we know this because during the early stages of the launch, there was a glich in the licence key activation that would flag your account as owning the game, but result in a 'no entitlements' error when trying to connect to a game server, all the while being successfully logged into the launcher.  So they do have the ability to disable the game without locking you out of your whole account.
---
I got a 2 hour pan from rainbow 6 for saying spicey a while back. Aparently their chat filter didn't like it because there is a racist slur inside the word lol.
---
This is like some Don Quixote shit, made me chuckle. Nicely done!
---
You’re right , it showed up eventually, thanks
---
For a build to be over buffed, they would need to start buffing things, not nerfing everything else.
---
I wish I could like your idea and your edit separately. I agree with both!
---
Don't cheat in a multiplayer game and you should be good.
---
I haven't used a pistol for a decent amount of time since... the first 30 levels? Sure as hell didn't kill more than a few hundred robots at that point, and I'm level 130 now. Once I hit 50 I went full heavy, and a rifle or 2. 
---
edgy stuff
---
The workshop way up north next to the robot that has the cooking quest, the one with 3 acid?
---
That workshop often has radscorpions attack it for the Defend the Workshop quests.
---
Me too. I think Responder Bot Greg in downtown Grafton also had it
---
Do you cheat at multiplayer games, too?
---
Never read the novel tbh, but thanks. 
---
The perk manager mod for PC works seamlessly. I can see them copying it exactly....or just chucking something in that just doesn't work properly.
---
I think it was pretty clear that as long as you aren't found with 1,000s upon 1,000s of a rare item on your character you are fine to craft as you please.  
---
Here's the thing, if you simply play the game as intended, it will be impossible to acquire stupid amounts of a rare item and you will be fine.   
---
And of course, the "gaming youtubers" are happy to push said false claims to stir controversy and get clicks

I guess the point is that this system lack a bit of logical. 
---
We have the card and we can equip it anytime as needed.
---
But we have to do it manually and as the situation demands.
---
Since one acquire a new card each level and levelling is quite easy you end up with a lot of cards for your build but few slots to use them.
---
Which bring us to the boredom road.
---
Or Beth implement a grouping card quick profile to be selected (there is a mod on pc for that right now, so it's doable).
---
Or lock when the perks can be selected to be used. Let's say you can choose cards only in your camp. Or change them only when you gain a new level. 
---
And implememt a RESPEC system.

Oh so you're instead blindy believing what Bethesda says(guess what they also aren't presenting any proof here). Who would've guessed such a person would exist here in this sub of all places. Not like Bethesda hasn't blatantly lied before right? You shouldn't believe either side without any proof.

"Here at Bethesda, we hear you loud and clear: we will be nerfing melee weapons so that they are effectively made out of foam, just like bullets, thus prolonging the game length."
---
&gt;Leave feedback and come back
---
...
---
&gt;Waaah this sub is filled with petty stuff
---
Great that is how i saw it...
---
....just they forgot to secure the Dev room and to randomize an ID for all Legendaries so that duped versions could be traced. They also did not see fit to make Legendaries bind on pick-up or use a ton of other methods currently used in most games to prevent duping.
---
So your statement about them having basic security and tracking tools, is....well...yet to be determined.
---
Yes, I also think that they shared the team to other games.  the only reason why they continue with fallout 76 is because they can get money with microtrasnsactions  
---
That’s why punishments should be more severe for doing so
---
Here you go friend, an upvote to help alleviate the downvotes, more than likely from duper’s 
---
I think the solution is more a long the lines of having two types of slots for  world / camp. 
---
Basically you have a set that’s active when exploring and a set that’s active when camping. 
---
Slot availability should still be rare enough that you have to make meaning full choices say between gun crafting vs armour vs energy weapons. 
---
Lock picking or Carry weight vs combat boosters. 
---
But you shouldn’t have to choose between hacking and crafting. Super Duper vs Scrounger etc.
---
Point balance is still then very important a strong character might not get as much value in camp where as intelligence highly rewards camp life so there is a real trade of for pursuing either path. 
---
Only time will tell game just came out. Never had a game like this before. Should have had a lot of these bugs fixed before release no doubt but give them a good 6-8 months of adjustments before forming such a harsh opinion. They told us it would be a process before release I knew that when I bought the game. 
---
Banning a cheater from one game, fair enough. But banning them from other games they didnt cheat in, that's not right. If you think it's fair, you're wrong. It's not even up for discussion.
---
I dont give a shit that a server hop doenst reset them, that was cheese to the extreme. What DOES piss me off though is that the reset time on each cap stash appears to be ONE WEEK LONG. Everything else resets after about a day (ammo, meds etc) why is this weekly?
---
My crashes went away when I got rid of my targeting hud. :(
---
Indeed, when companies get "too big" especially in the entertainment industry, it seems that creativity get's undermined. We see the same picture in the music- and film industry. Profit optimization doesn't necessarily includes quality-products as a goal or sadly even as a long term necessity.
---
I know that Bethesda still has many creative people who would personally LOVE to develop a game they'd like to play themselves, but they have they hands tied. Not even Todd Howard has the final word on game design because there is still Bethesda Softworks and then Zenimax Media above, and their CEOs don't give a jack shit about anything but profit, and profit is siphoned from the masses.  
---
So unless the appeal of the masses changes towards more complex, challenging games, I see Bethesda games just spiral further down into making even more trivial, meaningless, cake-walk games.
---
Take your strange in numbers off - mess around with it a bit. It'll fix.
---
You missed the part where they stated the banned accounts were holding hundreds of thousands of rare in game items that would be impossible to acquire by legitimate means.  They were not banned for crafting 1000's of crap armor to unlock mods.  
---
Propaganda pretty much works anywhere
---
Hmm, i guess i need to try that, tnx
---
I’ve had this happen when I have extra unequipped armor in my inventory for those slots. 
---
A bad egg is a bad egg, it's a deterrent too :-)
---
I mean, half the reports I saw feign innocence for a few hundred words and then slyly slip in the fact that they took items from the bags of dupers they killed, as if that isn't somehow just as bad.
---
&gt; 60+ disconnects over 20 days means you delivered a shit product. Make it right!
---
Got proof? I have potato internet (4g tethering) and maybe disconnect twice a session at most
---
Ah I think I see it, yeah it might be that. 
---
This is the shit I'm talking about it, you can't even be civil. I try to be nice about it, but you just reply like spiteful cunt. 
---
&gt; Don't cheat in a multiplayer game and you should be good.
---
'should' that's the key word here.  However, considering Bethesda track record with sound coding abilities, I don't trust their cheat-detection tools.  When they can't even release a patch that isn't buggy, how are we supposed to have faith in their cheat detection software?
---
The Cocktus
---
Don't worry about it. Good news is you're not alone. 400 hours in and I had no idea the card started at 2, thought it was bugged. Your post helped get it cleared up!
---
There is a 3 cost 1 rank card that says you never get addicted to alcohol
---
Got common sense? How do I prove that, I can't. That's why you say it, cuz you're soooooo smart
---
So would I be banned if I found a paper bag with 5k of a rare item in it? Cause that would be unfair, not everyone knows that someone else may have duped those items.
---
&gt;coordinated propaganda....this isn't an election or a coup.
---
Yeah, as per the B
---
Lots of random shit happens in this game, try having your HP slowly decline, then decline fast then slow again until you die... game is a mess. They are fighting time and getting sloppier and sloppier with structuring the code. half the time my marsupial jump doesn’t work.... shits just random. Yesterday my 4 power cores drained in 1.5 hrs of play.
---
Because it realistically couldn’t be carried at all and sit wherever in the game world you exit it. There are gameplay accommodations and limitations.
---
Oh no. Its not good enough.
---
Finally getting this game into a launch worthy state, at this point, isnt good enough. Since thats where it should have been months ago. 
---
Bethesda needs to fix it, and improve it, very quickly.
---
You have an 8 year old account, and (I didn't go too far back in your post history, but) you otherwise seem fairly normal, and you haven't posted in any gaming community in at least a month.... what on earth possesed you to post this? I don't get it.
---
Another option is to have them tied to INT and PER points, either every 2nd or 3rd point goes up a level
---
I haven't checked, I always put hardened mass in before I scrap all. Bulk auto scraps as of the hot fix, which is annoying. If I have any bulk on me that I plan to sell and I click scrap all, i have to bulk it again.
---
Let me know if it helps for you too. Big difference for me but more data would be great.
---
the problem is that very often you don't actually get to do the event.
---
it shows on map, you fast travel to it (and pay the fee), only to find that the event is nearly finished.  or not in progress at all.
---
so people are avoiding events because they don't want to waste caps for the travel fee, when there is a decent chance they won't get to do the event.
---
So, it's not just Bethesda you're shitting on then?
---
Anyone who actually likes Fallout or TES deserves a shitty game next time, eh?
---
Go home kid, have a wank and sort your life out. You've clearly got bigger issues than this.
---
Lightest? No offense intended here, but...are you taking your time? Exploring and observing?
---
I have to take frequent breaks from this game, due to the emotional gut punches of the environmental storytelling (which is a Master Class effort, and I mean that, no sarcasm). This game has the heaviest, most hopeless and forlorn atmosphere of any of the games, in my opinion.
---
The artists and those responsible for environmental design deserve serious kudos, for outdoing the industry in terms of environmental storytelling. Its really top notch.
---
They don't need to put their heart and soul into developing a game. If they do, they are probably taken advantage of by management. I want devs who can actually fix this game.
---
Lol. So instead you throw a bitch fit.
---
Grow the fuck up and don't make claims you can't back up
---
The environmental storytelling here is a Master Class effort. Really top notch stuff.
---
Assuring regular customers that they are serious about curating and policing the player base is certainly a good way to win more people than lose some unruly wannabe pg.
---
&gt; I try to be nice about it
---
Not really. You're *pretending* to be nice about it.
---
&gt;I'm expecting this to receive many downvotes because that's how a lot of people on this sub react to feed-back (they don't seem to like the taste of their own medicine.)
---
Stay away, we don’t need dragons here!
---
Gatling gun is a pistol? Guess I need to  update my concealed carry.  
---
RemindMe! 5 hours
---
Okay dad sorry
---
So you reported them to Bethesda?
---
I have 0 confidence in Bethesda doing anything correctly...
---
That something that innocuous affects the server is pretty sad. I mean, sure, if the person is crafting 50+ items quickly, I could maybe see a bit of an issue. But this is a crafting centric game. Crafting cannot be allowed to drag server performance into the mud in a crafting centric game. That's...pretty flawed design, right there, it is.
---
This. I find it insane how people sink hundreds of hours into the game then say nothing positive about it.
---
And yet i'm the mentally ill one
---
Nah fam 
---
Where'd U find the note?
---
&gt; I haven’t seen concrete proof yet
---
Prepared to bet you never will.
---
Montana is bigger than Germany dude. Lol 
---
i completed a use bobble heads challenge couple days ago from using stimpacks......
---
also there seems to be a few new challenges i never seen before(not talking aboot dailys or weekly)
---
It's truthful, is it not? It always happens. I'm not going to pretend like it isn't the case. 
---
TSE weapons are still doing like 400+ damage. They are still up there as the strongest guns in the game. Only now, instead of being 10x stronger than anything else, they are now just really good top tier weapons.
---
As for melee, I think people really are overstating how good melee is. I use bloodied claws. Yeah, it's possible for me to get my damage to 1500. But there's a lot of limitations on that. It's not melee that is overpowered, it's not even bloodied melee weapons, it's stacking bloodied melee weapons with talons, twisted muscles, adrenal reactions, nerd rage, radicool, and 5 pieces of unyielding armor.
---
Nuke zone? No good. Gotta trade all the unyielding for power armor or, if using unarmed, hazmat. But outside of a nuke zone, I'm a god... Ehhh, kind of. See, you gotta run around radiated down to like 40 hp. 
---
PvE? Yeah, you kill almost anything in one hit, but you have to be close. Gotta be right there in the front, taking all the fire. Even in low level areas, you're just one unlucky hit away from death.
---
PvP? Sure, you have a good chance of getting the first kill... But in a group, or an extended altercation, advantage is to the people with a gun. Totally it looks like this: guy slaps you, you punch through his head. He comes back for revenge, one shots you from range, while you try to close to melee. You come back for revenge, one shots you from range, while you try to close to melee. You come back for revenge, one shots you from range, while you try to close to melee.
---
Blame YouTube "journalists" for spreading this "Bethesda is banning innocent players" nonsense. One dude claimed he was banned for crafting a weapon just to scrap them for mods. Bullshit. I just finished learning all the handmade mods and no way did I come close to the +1600 weight limit. He and others were cheaters that simply got caught, period.
---
took this pic a week or so ago, so they are still in game.

the Facshnacht mask you mentions is not the one that alway spawns on the floor in Fort deliverence right? I always pick it up for scrap. Does the Dev room version look different?
---
My conclusion is that white spring golf club spawn point is severely bugged and will be fixed.
---
I feel you. I'm part of an ever-shrinking faction of folks who still hope and dream this game can work, in spite of all the problems. 
---
Over the past few days I haven't logged in, I've played spectator to the fallout of these patches; and gamers like myself are really reaching the point where we can't take it anymore.
---
TL;DR: We LOVE Fallout, but Bethesda needs to stop acting like she wants to see other people.
---
Yeah, sorry, I don't feel reassured by this. I think it's heavy handed, and short sighted.
---
Actually I was looking for a ghoul slayer gamma gun
---
Care to elaborate?  
---
You missed the entire point I was trying to make and then came back with LoL LoOk I tOlD yOu So! Whatever dude, you're a fucking moron. Have a nice day fucking moron. Bethesda says, Bethesda says! 
---
MY POINT WAS YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. IT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM OVER A DAY TO COME OUT AND TELL PEOPLE. NO OTHER GAME IS LIKE THAT.
---
Replying because I’m curious as well 
---
Your assertion is that bans are undeserved which isn’t my opinion.
---
I don’t have personal experience with this glitch but in the two screenshots posted on this thread where it has happened here, it looks like the nuke zone has been really far south.  Maybe it is related to the nuke zone being off the map and the queen gets stuck outside the map bounds and the AI just doesn’t know how to get her back into the fight.  To be safe I would keep the nuke zone well within the fenced off area of the map to prevent this from happening.
---
From seeing complaints in private where they don't have to try garner sympathy from Bethesda, they're doing things like crafting enough fusion cores to get a new character to level 50. Absurd no matter what you're crafting, but if you don't remember, I suggest going and checking the crafting requirements for a fusion core and laugh.
---
They say it's legit because this account didn't dupe the items they used, but they acknowledge they got the items from a friend and have multiple alt accounts they did dupe on, so know how rare various items in the game are, they're not just an innocent newbie - and if you go *look* at the ToS, the terms ban "taking advantage of an exploit", which, y'know, doesn't require actually *performing* it yourself. The guy knew it had to be duped material (and was specifically requesting such stupid amounts, it was the plan) and went ahead with it anyway.

You can plant fruits and vegetables on campfires.  It's easier with mutfruit trees.  Once you plant on the campfire, just pick up the campfire and move to where you want it.
---
Yes, a video game studio in regards to a videogame with microtransactions would *definitely* want to inspire ill-will in people who could be playing legitimately and are potential sources of income via those microtransactions.
---
That would be a proper experiment
---
My assertion is from Bethesda shoddy track record.  Which clearly states, they are not to be trusted.
---
This.
---
Eh, thats what the pacifist settings for.
---
Ive seen alot of hunting tactics, but the one Ive seen mentioned the most isnt to gank persay.. But sneak up in steath and wait for them to drop the items they are trying to dupe.. And then run in and snag said items.  If they get mad and attack, well then you can kill them and take their junk too.
---
Regardless, no one can kill you or take your stuff unless you drop it.. Which if you're not dupping, you're probably not dropping 1000+bobbleheads into a bag.
---
Frankly anyone who thinks 97 cores is an indication of dupping is either a moron or yanking your leg.
---
They're not safe. Bethesda gave instructions not to pick up items that are suspected to have been generated via exploitation. If they have already, they need to submit a ticket about it before they're banned. There should be a load screen or start screen message about it to make sure it gets to every possible player.
---
Just focus the attention on fixing issues, not the nerf the other shit.
---
I think I’ll believe Bethesda over you.
---
You get down voted for mentioning it but in all seriousness the packs we open for perks are designed for just that....to end up on the Atom store. It may never happen now as the launch was terrible and they would never recover from the outrage if they did.
---
Animated perk cards, which we never see unless were switching a card, with tool tips suggesting we should collect them all? Why are perks unlocking in Packs anyways? Card packs have never been a Fallout thing...until a company that's only experience is micro transactions gets a hold of the Fallout IP.
---
Realistically, the market's going to be fucked for the foreseeable future.  There are too many duped 3-stars floating around at this point, and with no soulbind or permanent decay feature, the only way to get them out of circulation would be to wipe the server and start over once they're 1000000% certain that all the dupes are fixed.
---
You could still need xyz amount of points in the correct special for the passive perks to activate though no?
---
As far as i can tell? More rewards at once
---
But karma whoring whining posts on reddit should be trusted.
---
More of a 1950’s aesthetic. There was a massive economic boom shortly after WW2 that was coupled with the fear of total atomic annihilation. This is the point of divergence between our timeline and the one in the Fallout series. 
---
The culture of the 50’s was drastically different to that of pre-war America. 
---
Plus the lack of team based content
---
Yup, you're right. Huh. Had a different number in mind. 
---
You not doing it right.  Supposedly the duper craft hundreds of items at a time...surprised people trust Beth more than other community members after the way they bitch slapped us.  Should have known this game was going to be shit when there was NO patch after beta.  Not freaking one!!  
---
i made a mod for finding meatpiles easier [here you go](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/144?tab=description), i have not updated it in a while, so maybe it doesn't work anymore, if it doesn't work let me know and i'll update it. 
---
Dupers use multiple alt accounts to carry their stuff due to the overweight slowdown. No player playing legitimately would carry any item in these quantities around.
---
Near the BoS Asylum, in the middle of nowhere. 
---
ya this sub is awful in that regard, i wish it was easier to keep up with game update info without needing reddit.  i cant even break the launch code puzzle without the reddit link help.  yo me, the reddit sub has become just as 'toxic' as it is essential.
---
Your right, not sure why you'd be down voted.
---
There's nothing worthy of 3 perk points in any of the safes in the game. Its crap you can get every where else in abundance.
---
Holy fuck who the hell cares
---
You could be right, but I think it was more of a oversight. By what I've seen from the posts the backlash from reducing and nerfing too much can be seen, I hope they would give us at least alternatives to the grind.
---
I have not experienced this same problem, it must be a server related thing.
---
Thank
---
You overplayed your hand. The other guy is right.
---
See if you left it as just the first half, I would be on your side but the real reason for your "genuine sympathy" is self-centred &amp; self-serving. You're not being empathetic towards unhappy player's plight. You want them to stop complaining so you can get more of the content you want.
---
There's a word for people like you - two-faced. 
---
Every update I've had less and less crashes and disconnects I'm also on PS4 
---
It seems to be very hit and miss, I played for 2 hours last night no problem but a buddy of mine was having a hell of a time when he played also on PS4 
---
It becomes a problem because repairing and crafting items becomes not just a grind but a frustating grind as all resources are constantly picked clean on the over world.  NPC's are constantly be being killed so you just fast travel to corpse town with a dozen players all fighting over the next spawn of the mobs.  Resulting in higher level players killing lower level ones just to push them away.  Making advancing on the game nearly impossible.
---
This needs more upvotes! Thank you for this, people need to know when YouTube has gone too far and these toxic minority seem to be the loudest voices, but as we are learning, the few are able to peacock themselves to appear to be the majority. Thanks for putting these criminals in their place. Also thank you for this great game, I love it, and will support it until the end of time.
---
If white spring is nerfed, there will be many alternatives 
---
I sure hope he is banned forver. Fuck exploiters in online games!
---
Boring Saturday morning? 
---
Sorry my bad, post-war. Thanks for the correction :) 
---
A ban is a ban, not a little slap on the wrist. Dupers are litterally destroying the game, of course Bethesda is going to full ban their accounts. A cheater is a cheater, regardless of whether or not they played other Bethesda games. I swear people are delusional.
---
It's like a landlord owning multiple buildings and you want to rent a room in each one. You completely trashed the first room and stole stuff from the building, almost burnt the entire place to the ground. You were just evicted but you seem to think that the same owner wants you living in their other property? Guess what, you are no longer welcome in any of their buildings.
---
THIS IS THE EXACT SAME THING
---
Thats a left leg and you know it!
---
Some can it seems dependant on luck although there seems to be no effect beyond 17-20 
---
Not sure why you re being downvoted mate
---
Seriously think about it... there's plenty of online games that had rough releases, poor reviews, sales fell off but they're still active and have not been abandoned by developers. That's the thing that makes me chuckle about these dramatics.  This has all happened before, this isn't some unique situation. Hell we may see this happen all over again in less than a month with Anthem (have a friend playing the beta, sounds like there's plenty of potential for disappointment).
---
I wish this wasn't a common occurrence, that games came out at their peak, and met everyone's expectations.   I get that's frustrating.  But have enough common sense to know a rough start doesn't mean it's doomed.
---
Yes exactly the same here
---
Your friend duped 
---
Doesn't matter what he thinks, he broke the rules

All dupers deserve a perma ban

---
They realize it, and they have the ability to just block him from using 76, but they took the deliberate dick-move of banning him from everything. 
---
They also have had the ability to stop legendary duping dead in it's tracks, but they've chosen not to do it.
---
All they have to do is 3 simple things.
---
* Lock legendary items to the character/account that first picks them up.
---
* Disable trade / sale / drop of legendary items.
---
* Enable scrapping of Legendary items. 
---
This would have stopped the dupers dead in their tracks, by preventing them from handing the items off to others.  Also, duping requires placing the objects in bags, or handing them off to others. Blocking both things would prevent the duping process all together.
---
This issue was caused by Bethesda.
---
Guys, you've been communicating really well the last couple of days. Thank you.
---
We get so much nonsense said online and It's great to have this cleared up. The other post was exactly what we needed: it detailed what's been fixed and what will be fixed in future.
---
**This is so much better. Keep doing this, please.**

Or don't cheat and you won't have to worry? You know logic 
---
From what I hear, you have to turn it in one by one, if you turn it bulk, it takes it all and only offers one reward
---
You also can’t loot it if there’s a plant on top of it.  Even after you picked the plant, it’s still blocking the meat pile.   Or  you could have meat piles stacked on top of one another.   You won’t even know there’s another pile under the current one until you take everything from the top one expose.  Another problem with this stacked pile is, if another player contributed to the kill, the top pile will stay there until the other player takes all the damn loot from it too.   
---
AFKing it you get maybe 100 candy per 15-ish minute event. That would require playing it 5000 times. That would require playing it 24/7 for 52 days straight, and they're talking about items gained in the last 30 days.
---
Now, if you actually play it, you can earn a lot more - with three people playing it and letting one person keep the mask, you can probably get around 2000 candy per event. That would make 500,000 more doable - it would only take 2.68 days of constant play of this event. On the *other* hand, that's 2.68 days of *nothing* else, and requiring two other people assisting with no benefit to themselves. If you swapped between the three of you, so that it's more realistic people might actually come along to do it, then it needs the three of you to be playing nothing else 24/7 for more than a week.
---
This is all aside from the fact they didn't specifically say that halloween candy has a threshold of 500,000 - they gave that number as an example for a quantity of a rare item, and halloween candy as an example of a rare-ish item. They also suggested tens of millions as an example, and nuka-colas as a rarer item. It's far more likely that the 500,000 threshold applies to nukas, and halloween candy probably has a slightly higher threshold to account for obsessive hoarders.
---
Good luck!

I'm not sure without adrenal reaction as I've had it for so long but all my melee weapons routinely get past 1K while doing work.
---
I would rather they fix all their buggy code before adding anything.  They have proven time and again they can't even handle that much. Don’t give them MORE fuel to their funeral pyre.
---
Hmm weird. It seemed like the other people in the nuke zone were also just standing over bodies waiting for like 5-6min for items to load in
---
I agree with this fully! I understand people are saying that we have to make choices with builds etc, but the peek card system was thought out this way before all the changes and nerfs. Who wants to waste 3 cards of perception on having lockpick fully enabled? Nobody, that's who!
---
 Realize that there are alot of crap people on the internet and move on. Most people coming on to these forums to vent just want an echo chamber to validate themselves. The game absolutely deserves some constuctive criticism as does some of the venomous member of the community.
---
*Trade-steal glitch*
---
Was never real.

*Hacking other players on PC*

The list of utter bullshit grows so often I've honestly forgotten half of the controversies.

Don't take it so personally, it's genuinely strange.

I’m on Xbox and it was bad last night. I was in a nuke zone with about 5 others and we finished off a fairly large group of baddies when I got booted. Logged back on to a different server of course BUT in the area where we had the big fight there were 3 drop bags from other players. Was weird. Got kicked off again about a half hour later so I switched to KH3. 
---
If you say so.

To be honest with all the cap nerfs and the mothman nerfs..They made WhiteSprings even more of the place to go for ..xp..junk..chems..it is a one stop shop and highly effective in achieving all of those..sadly even I may have to move my base here..haven’t camped at white spring since like week 2..bleh
---
All his friends were in there too backing him up. Those friends... also innocent of any other bans coming obviously.
---
It’s alright. How are you supposed to know? Your knowledge of geographical figures are very limited. Don’t worry. 
---
I think Protectron's laser weapon is a laser pistol. That's why. Just like "Kill a Wendigo wearing clown costume".
---
Honestly, your armor is nearly moot as far as protection provided if we’re talking pvp. Two heavy hitters going at it will always be decided by who lands the first blow. As for pve, most of your damage mitigation comes from perks for non pa in the form of barbarian, blocker, evasive, serendipity, etc. Unyielding combined with bloodied will turn you into one punch man if combined with the proper mutations and an unarmed weapon.
---
Don't worry it's not personal. Just calling out BS when I see it. 
---
I know you guys have alot on your plate, but could you also increase the camp budget as well?
---
&gt; Most people coming on to these forums to vent just want an echo chamber to validate themselves.

I keep hearing both of these lol
---
Honestly this should be done with a lot of perks, not just lockpick and hacking. I would say anything that isn't directly related to combat should be included. Things like crafting and workshop building/material saving. I'm fine with keeping weight stuff and food/junk cards as they are since more weight available = more weapons/armor/ammo. But the other stuff is just annoying to swap. 
---
Megga
---
So a person cheats, and Bethesda is to blame?
---
Stop treating cheaters like spoiled kids, and maybe they will mature enough to stop using exploits.
---
I don't even have enough junk to craft 10 of anything, left alone several dozen. Most I ever crafted at once was maybe a dozen Marine helmets.
---
Addicted to chems maybe?
---
Once you can turn it in you won’t be able
---
to stack it anymore, so your best bet is to get a friend and pass them one, turn it in and then server hop and put another one in 
---
For 1 piece you get 350xp, for 2 you get 400. That is the only difference I have seen and do this quest 2-3 times a day. I have tested taking as many as 15 pieces and still only 400xp and the regular amount of aid/ammo without a noticeable change to what I receive otherwise, armour seems to be pure RNG. Also they seem to have nerfed the spawn rate on the item as I used to find at least 6 in the wing with all the desks at the Enclave bunker, now I'm lucky to find 2 in those desks. I'm not one t go all conspiracy but it really does feel like anything that was easy xp or caps is getting reduced in every patch. 
---
They don't teach obsolete scales of units here. 
---
&gt;The fact that they're acknowledging this stuff is good enough.
---
Are you serious? Apart from ignoring the issue this is the second least thing they could do! I play a lot of racing games and recently rFactor 2 released an update. The update had issues, they posted confirming the issues and that they were working on a hotfix. That hotfix was out the same day.
---
Compare and contrast with FAILout 76. Bugs go ignored for years (Lever Action rifle reload bug was in Fallout 4), finally get fixed only to break other things far worse and somehow undo previous fixes! It is beyond a joke that this was ever considered a AAA release. Even for an early access title this level of incompetence is unforgivable.
---
It is hard to "let go' of something you love. 
---
Yes people like myself are unhappy with the recent changes, but we love the Fallout Franchise. Many of us have spent 100s and dare i say 1000s of hrs playing and replaying Fo3, NV, Fo4 and some of us go all the way back to the original FALLOUT and Fo2 from the 90s.
---
We want this to be the multiplayer we always dreamt FO could be and we want to be part of it from the beginning. It is so painful to watch it crashing and burning so badly, but we have to cling to hope.
---
It is like having a childhood friend that you did so much with that you barely have a memory of being a kid that doesn't include him/her. now that friend has been making a lot of dumb mistakes and you WANT so bad to help them but they just wont listen. everyone around you sees your frustration and tells you to walk away...but it just is not that easy.
---
How do you turn it in, in bulk? I’ve got a bunch I can’t get rid of. Every time I complete the quest it accepts one and the quest completes. I need to find another to start the quest again. Can you drop it in a container and pick it up again?
---
If in 5 years he has a job and more disposable income then he can buy a new console and make a new account. Theres TONS of logic to the ban, there is however no logic to your comment.
---
He broke the ToS. Said ToS apply to any other games published by Bethesda. A ban from all the games sharing that ToS is only logical.
---
For the first month of the game I could walk in front of enemies without getting detected, but in December that patch with a few hidden nerfs happened and my sneak has been way worse since. Few people noticed it, but somehow everyone rejected that it actually happened. 
---
Oh maybe it was fixed, what happened to me before was I had like 20, when I clicked it accepted all 20 and only gave my reward. Everyone has been suggesting that as soon as you get one to try and go before collecting more
---
Are You Okay? Honestly, you sound... off. You're acting as if I've physically assaulted you... What the actual fuck? 
---
I get the same problem with collecting water as well as crafting boiled water.
---
This is how they extend the end game, by making the final boss literally unbeatable
---
Another thing that bothers me is that if one enemy detects you, they all do, regardless of Affiliation. If a scorched sees you, all of them do, which makes sense. But if a fuckin molerat sees me, every mutant and his hound and ghouls and scorched for miles around should not instantly know my exact location.
---
I think they don’t have a lot of motivation to lie in this case. It would be insane bad PR if there was something causing the wrong people to be banned, they knew about it, and they still let it keep happen. If they hadn’t addressed it, I may still have suspicions. But they did. So from where I stand, the cheater that got banned and is sour about it has way more motivation to lie. 
---
The tse gause rifle fully perked is 488 about what the tse handmade used to be
---
Yeah thats pretty much what i meant with Enemy A and B. It sucks. 
---
Should chem addiction show up on the effects tab? Nothing is there about chems. When I log in later I'll try taking an addictol to be sure.
---
I have speed demon, twisted muscles, healing factor, and marsupial, but no herd mentality.
---
Maybe, stop asking for new things when they can’t even reliably fix the broken things they have now.
---
It got nerfed somehow or it is bugged. I hope its the latter. 
---
As someone who no longer plays 76 (physically unable to play due to game errors) and never publicly complains about it in any way, I think people are well within their bounds to be pretty upset about this game. 
---
Consumer data is my forte, and it’s stunning to see so many people blindly follow Beth through this mess. But not as stunning as what Beth is doing to its own fan base in the first place. 
---
If I was a Beth fan to begin with, my soul would be pretty crushed knowing now how little they give a shit. People can barely play the game, but we’ve got the beginnings of pay to win making its way into the Atom Shop...
---
Shame. 
---
Hacker and lockpick cards aren't like other cards. They have three unique tiers of only one star each. Once you get one, you no longer need that same tier, so extras disappear. You'll need to find "expert" or "master" versions to use them.
---
xbox user here. I keep seeing a bug where if I let rads push my health below 50 percent and then use radaway and a super stim pack I will no long take rad damage until I fast travel. If I use regular stimpacks everything functions like it should and I can take rads.   It makes blast zones feel cheap, so now I just drop the supers or sell them to vendors.
---
At present they don't but the Vault Boy on the stat screen should have a sad face. Buffout/Alcohol addiction reduces strength. 
---
I just want to see people's cool unique builds, real feedback, response to the world/atmosphere, you know-- the same shit you'd see in every other fallout game, not just the same 5 posts over and over again about how this game sucks donkey balls.
---
Some random loot
---
Nothing special but it does feel good when you finish it. 
---
oh wow a trash post that shot to the top of r/fallout with absolutely no evidence is complete bullshit? color me shocked.
---
The sub is for discussion about the game good or bad.
---
If Bethesda had made a slightly less broken product and charged people for it there wouldn't be so much "toxicity" as you put it, you get that right?
---
Just because feedback doesn't come dressed up as "we love Bethesda, Fallout 76 is the best game ever" doesn't make it any less relevant. If anything its better as it may stop un-suspecting people from dropping there hard earn't cash on a game that isn't up to standard.
---
3 months 5 patches and the game is still in pretty much the same broken state a it was at launch, should have been FTP in till it was ready to come out of a BETA state.
---
used to be camped in this location but moved cuz all the other people using it, 1/3 of the time i logged in i couldn't place my camp.  worst part was how many of the camps were built significantly worse (ascetically) than mine including OPs.  when i spent days working on a camp and have to move cuz all the other people who want that camp spot for their ugly camp.  i will never again disclose good camp locations on the internet,  just makes it harder to find a server with that spot open.
---
Yeah, I don't bother either. Only to turn turrets against robots in silos 
---
AH! That must be it. I do have a sad face and didn't know why. Thanks to both of you for likely solving it. I'll down some addictol and go back to being a hulking caveman!
---
My work around for that was to use Pipe Revolver Rifles. Crafted with a Forceful Stock a Hardened Receiver and Suppressor, it takes advantage of both Riflemen And Pistol Perks. I used this gun until recently when I kitted out my Lever Action which I now use exclusively. The Adrenal reaction Mutation is also something that I use along with Chameleon and Speed Demon boosting my damage output further. I solo Whitesprings, West-Tek, etc with no problems, no explosions ( until I blow up the cars heh), no Legendaries. 
---
The biggest example No Man's Sky.  Star Wars Battlefront II had a whole lotta drama but still producing new content.  Destiny 2 has had it's shit through out its current course, especially with Curse of Osiris, but it's still chugging along.
---
there has been constant misinformation rolling out of r/fallout since the launch of this game. they never have evidence, but that sub loves to circlejerk the hate for this game and will literally upvote *anything* trashing it. it's seriously bullshit.
---
I don't even enjoy playing it that much. Although it's pretty fun and it's decent for killing time. "Bethesda bad" got old a while back.
---
I’ve got like 13 that I can’t get rid of. I guess I collected them before that mission was available. I just avoid picking them up now. I don’t think I got much value from the quest.
---
How about global notification of events starting using a radio station(so you don't get spamed) or a different colour marker for events which have been started and if you select the event it shows the progress? 
---
Same here. It is literally playable.
---
Ad Victoriam, Brother.

[this is still an issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a80qei/hat_plans_are_missing_their_category_thats_why/)
---
I know I had this exact same problem, but it wasn't a bug, just some in-game effect that didn't display well. It was a while ago though or I would remember what I actually did to finally fix it.
---
Very much a YMMV thing.
---
I would say in the times I've played since the patch, I've had slightly more out-of-the-blue disconnects, but what I see more often are those behaviors characteristic of server decay, like vendors taking a long time to list their goods, corpses and containers being slow to load their loot, unresponsive workbenches, etc.
---
I'll put it this way - nothing improved.
---
Umm... No. I'm fine dude. That's just you projecting. 
---
I would really want this
---
Why?, Simply because this, there is no consistency in their own lore.
---
[Better than a Goul Slayer's :-D](https://imgur.com/1cetWPz)
---
Same here.  I just don't like spending the time to swap out cards when chances are I'm not going to find anything worth the time spent swapping cards twice.
---
And things like this is why you ask for proof and fact check. Blind hate leads to blind wars. 
---
Just be grateful you still have friends that play fallout 76 at all.
---
Yes
---
Yeah, it would be inappropriate to introduce your nephew to this game. There are way better games to get them.
---
Holy shit, you're dense.
---
Unyielding 
---
Also, teammates disappear no name or visible.
---
PA and armor not stacking.
---
If a person attacks a base then yes they should be wa nted.
---
Full opt out mode for pvp.
---
More content and DLC instead of pvp updates, quit catering to a minority of players. Quit trying to push pvp.
---
Fix the bugs.
---
More random encounters in the wild.
---
Fix legendaries not dropping legendary items.
---
Quit nerfing shit, scale enemies to compensate for player.
---
Respec, respec, respec one free one should be available. Also, put it as a purchasable item in the Atom store.
---
Ok thanks i thought about specing into it
---
Yeah but comon sense should tell you a bag with 5k of a rare item shouldn't be picked up. And they state in the post it is 150,000 that triggers it so you would have to do that 29 more times and not craft anything.   
---
Don't know about you but I have only ran into 2 random bags of high loot in 300 hours. 
---
I guess they don’t want cheaters ruining their games. Your “friend” got what he deserved. Maybe “your friend” will stop cheating in games knowing it’s taken seriously.  
---
I ve reached around 1,6k and i can go higher by swapping some perks
---
Between poor quality control, gambling loot boxes, money grab Cash shops, is that really such a bad thing?
---
Unfortunately I'm ps4 otherwise I would've sold you it
---
Bloodied is always good but melee will always be better with an Unyielding set because Str equals melee damage
---
Welcome to nerf city
---
To be fair considering Bethesdas fuckups/general incompetence when it comes to literally every single aspect of the game so far it's not hard to believe someone got banned who shouldn't. 
---
I'm not disagreeing with your point really I'm just saying I can understand why people would see a post like that and not give Bethesda the benefit of the doubt at this point.
---
Yes they are to blame.  
---
They created the playground, they set the rules, and they have had the tools, and the ability to stop the duping dead in it's tracks as soon as they realized it was happening.  They could have prevented all the damage that was done to the game, but they didn't.  
---
Instead, they are attacking their player base, and pointing fingers instead of accepting responsibility for their own lack action and foresight.  And they STILL haven't blocked duping.
---
Unyielding for the damage bonus
---
I have crafted maybe 100 marine helmets in one time to sell to vendors for having enough for a week and don't get banned too  
---
This needs to make the front page.
---
I just want to if i can place my CAMP on top of it?
---
I don't play anymore but I come here every now and then to check for any meaningful updates or content and occasionally chime into a conversation.  
---
If you actually want to be real about this.... At least other people are giving feedback on the game and not posts they dislike.
---
The current news is 'Bethesda bad'.
---
Yeah I definitely feel like server disconnects have lessened, but yeah somehow the servers are way more laggy. I don't know. It's just upsetting. I'm super bored now endgame because, you barely have any challenge on the map and no way to collect better items, except with queen's, but everytime I do 1 I end up just hating the game because it's not a fun experience of lagging enemies jumping around and not being able to search the enemies I kill
---
Okay made it to the 2nd to last log and slipped of again gonna try this another day because the loot doesnt seem worth a broken controller. 
---
Thanks for the quick answers
---
I am sorry, I should have added /s at the end of my statement.
---
Use unyielding gear so you have 30+ AGI and LCK which let's you sneak and do vats crits at a rate unlike anyone else
---
Thank you
---
It stacks for me when I use my Revolver Rifle?
---
Very entertaining story, thank you!! :D
---
So is bloodied the effect that boosts damage the less health you have? If so how do you keep your health down to a level suitable? Is it radiation?
---
I'm going to stick around until they nerf melee so I can listen to what's remaining of the community to complain about how much the game sucks.
---
Oh, really? You seem to have some inside information - tell us, how could they stop duping right away?
---
So what you're saying is that you want exploiters to roam free to keep doing what they do. For some reason you are seeing this from a weird perspective: they are not attacking their playerbase, they are attacking kids that don't give a damn about the game and that's why the cheat.
---
And hopefully, a permaban from all Bethesda products will make them grow up a bit and learn a valuable lesson.
---
Where is this location?
---
You'll prob find the bans lifted just in time for pre orders of the next game.
---
Ad Victorium! Please don't tell my fellow soldiers I've been sneaking psychobuff before battles. 
---
Man, I love the environmental storytelling. Like the cabins (SPOILER) where you find out everybody died and the outpost tower nearby where you discover more dead corpses! There’s also the Responders locations (SPOILER) where you find out everybody got death. But my favorite is the town (SPOILER) where you find out everybody is dead.
---
I think the problem goes back to fallout 4, the game they copied most of the code from. In fallout 4 it didn’t matter that Malay could do more because in that game you could eventually do everything. In fallout 76, not enough attention was paid to balancing the different types of damage.
---
urh this deal is getting worse all the time
---
Why not use to scorchbeast poo pile instead?
---
I'm getting that a lot as well, sometimes a server dc while loading in that then freezes the game and I have to do a hard shutdown of the game. And it never fails that I end up server hopping on average 3 times for my camp to spawn.
---
This is true. I don’t know that any of my builds has the cards to run rank 5. 
---
Were you in a team ?
---
Oh that! Forgot about that place.
---
I came across it during beta, tried it once &amp; then hard passed due to inefficient use of beta time.
---
I wonder if the marsupial mutation makes this easier or harder?
---
You left out the part of Bethesda moving the goal posts.
---
I just leave a part of my bottom floor open for crops. Note, you have to put a porch on the side that's open for your outer wall to attach to. Bam! Indoor garden plot. Be sure and leave room for a small water purifier or two
---
Couldn't you read the label? lol
---
I don’t know why they bother? Nobody’s buying that shit right? They’ve resorted to putting items “on sale” and I don’t think anyone cares.
---
pretty much my point.  It's like that old movie, Austin Powers, they just lowered them into the shark tank. closed the doors and assumed it all went according to plan.
---
I'm surprised even for the sake of metrics they weren't tracking engagement.  It's one thing to have Todd watching people watching people play 4 on Twitch, it's another thing to actually be able to track every single user playing 76.
---
The whole thing feels like they just unsure of whatever the heck they were doing.
---
So is that a yes for bloodied effect or the radiation part lol
---
Just drop it in your base and wait for it to despawn
---
To both since you answered your own question!
---
Also adrenal reaction mutation does the same as bloodied, but it applies to all weapons (and stacks with bloodied)
---
Take your son outside with a bat and toss some baseballs. Once he’s got a good streak going, toss your copy of Fallout 76 at him.
---
Im in, what’s your IG?
---
people blame everything on duping. jumping too high? duping. not taking damage? duping. leveling bases? duper.
---
that's why I used quotation marks.
---
Gotcha
---
I stay away from owned workshops as well.
---
I won’t chase bounties either. 
---
Good luck
---
ryangutie
---
Seriously, You should be considered about accepting refund.
---
Brown bag in obscure location, fast travel far away &amp; Brown bag some other item. It will destroy the first bag &amp; given the distance, the new bag shouldn't spawn the item you want destroyed. 
---
It feels like the Russian bot algo was updated since last election and they needed something to test it out on so they are testing it on fo76.
---
Why are people so pissed at the game yet keep posting here? Nobody cares. I'm playing and will continue to play while these cry babies cry on reddit.
---
Same here XB1X,  Chameleon, Agility 19, Sneak, Escape Artist etc and am now in Perma-Caution...
---
Think I will do that, thankyou. 
---
yup, that's been the latest. "I was crafting to learn mods"
---
I went from "Goddahm, I still haven't met Grahm" to "How the hell do they look like Skeletor" in about half a second. 
---
Ok gonna be online in 10 min

&gt;Running around at 20% health, I'm a glass cannon. I die more than you can imagine.

&gt;It's not viable in a nuke zone.
---
&gt;It's very very specialized and still, unless I hop myself up on every drug/food and get a sneak attack, I'm not one shotting a SB.
---
you're definitely doing it wrong, then. check cheeseburger cake. he oneshots SBs without even trying. pretty much solos the queen as well, both with a hazmat and without.
---
and his build is not even that good.
---
Who are you replying to? you posted in the main thread.
---
Look for someone selling the mod itself. You cannot craft a separate mod like you can buy at a vendor or loot out in the world so expect to pay more.   
---
Also, look at the persons history, are there a lot of happy customers or is there nothing.
---
'Piece of shit'? 'PIECE OF SHIT'?!! OOoooOoooOooOooOo!!
---
Why dont you get on your fuckin bike and ride away? 👌
---
Thanks! Tired of all of these "fake news" posts. 
---
* "Oh my girlfriends account got banned for no reason"
---
* "Oh, I was crafting weapons for mods and got banned"
---
* "Oh, I never duped but got banned anyway, I just had 400k of ammo that I farmed and saved up"
---
Just admit you duped and got caught. It's simple.
---
SEE YOU ON THE OTHER END OF THE ROAD! LMAO
---
Still makes no sense to stack anything past 10k, plz tell m why would u even bother to pick it up after your doing that shit for 20h straigh. Please just tell m why would you. So far all you said is that you could (and yet i don't feel thats possible with how crap population density is right now)
---
Keep an eye out here for a few days. 
---
 "Guys, you'll never believe what I just found in a bag in an obscure location!  I didnt even know you could get this!"
---
Yeah, but in terms of Bethesda?  I think ESO is the only point of reference we have to go on.  They did ride that out and turned it into something respectable.
---
But I think 76 is an oddity because, on some level, it's much closer to Fallout 4 than an MMO.  And Fallout 4 had a similar drop-off where you run out of things to do and eventually quit, unless you really get into settlement building.
---
What I'm having trouble looking past is what Bethesda did with Doom 2016 - a game that got a solid year of updates, and then from out-of-the-blue, total silence.  Drop everything, don't fix anything else, lights out.
---
Where is it? I'll try kangarooing up there.
---
So seriously that half a year later this game still gon feel like an early alpha and nobody will play it, oops everyone already quited it anyways.
---
it's easier, but you're still hitting the cables way too often.
---
Good one! 
---
I'm good
---
So way see all.
---
Okay, I think we can all agree on that but, what are your thoughts on the mailbox not the broken game?
---
I'll take it if your on ps4
---
because people are stupid
---
Haha, what? Compare it to other prefixes: +10%, but only if you are mutated. +100%, but only if it hasn't taken any damage at all. +50%, but only if it is mostly dead. +(Up to) 50%, but only if *you* are mostly dead.+30%, but only if it is one certain kind of enemy. +10%, but only if it's a player. +(Up to) 30%, but only if you are hitting the same enemy consecutively. +100%, but only... wait no sorry, it's all the time. Just +100%, aaaand maybe reduce the accuracy some. No, that was not balanced before. It completely made obsolete every other effect. Even if it was +30 or 50, it would still make all those others obsolete because it would be as good as them, but all the time.
---
\&gt; I pity them. I'd be angry all the time, too, if I was 7 feet tall and had no dick. But this was not the time for compassion
---
I laughed out loud, for real. Well done.
---
3 simple changes to Legendary items.
---
* Enable scrapping of Legendary items.
---
You can't spread duped items if you can't trade / sell / or drop them.   Enabling of scrapping would allow people to get rid of legendary items they don't want / need.  Locking ownership of the item, would prevent people from finding exploits that would allow them to drop or trade the item.
---
All these things could have been done as soon as they realized duping was happening, because all these functions are already in the game.  Atom store for account locked items,  No trade sale or drop, is found in quest items.  And I shouldn't have to mention the whole scrapping thing, considering the current cluster fuck with bulk items.
---
I'm not seeing this from a weird perspective. I'm looking at this from the perspective of a long time fallout / elder scrolls player, who revels in the ability these games have provided, namely to tinker under the hood and make these games do things that the devs never intended.  Duping is nothing more than an extension of the tinkering that lead to mod development in the prior games.   Yes, it has had a negative effect on the game, but like I said before,  Bethesda has had the ability to stop it, they simply chose not to.
---
i know i'm late here, but i dont think OP has ever known any 'real professional djs', cuz most of this list is not something professional djs do.  maybe its similar to what radio djs do, but 'real professional djs' dont consider radio DJs to even be DJs.  i like the general idea here, but the DJ in me was triggered lol.
---
That’s fine. Give a penny take a penny. The greed of humans is unavoidable, simply thinking about functionality.
---
Yes... cheaters ruining this game.... not the shitty coders that developed the game whatsoever.
---
Bethesda is so sorry that when they were testing they didn't even craft 300 of an item to see what happened, I'd say that's untested unfinished and the developers fault.
---
they were greedy and rushed to production and launch which is why this game is circling the drain.
---
I wasn't the one saying it needs nerfed. I was defending it. I said it may need a bit of tweaking. I think that since you have to trade damn near all your hp to get it to work it isn't super op. In pvp setting, especially group PvP which is what is going to happen, you will die super fast.
---
I feel you. Had to give it up and go back to fo4. I ok not have a few hours a night to play. Most of that time is looking at a fucking loading screen or logging back into the game. At least with fo4 I can get my fix. I love the fallout world
---
Found the duper
---
Original dude who got banned claimed to have only crafted between 10 and 20 combat rifles.
---
Oh really now? Reddit should notify you when a mod deletes a comment. And which mod.
---
Or the genius TheQuatering, who gives a longish summary of *every* previous video, then a compilation of *memes* by shitposters under the Bethesda tweets, which he presents as "proof that the game is bad", ending the video with basically nothing said apart from "Fallout 76 Bad, Bethesda Bad".
---
Hatred makes you money really fast these days.
---
I did a no-power armour explosives build. (I'm focusing on my new melee character after the nerf.) Power armour is definitely a bit overrated. The utility of all the different mods it can get is no joke though.
---
When and where did u get the TSE?
---
The game hasn't been out long enough for people to be waiting on a banning verdict "for months". Unless he was in that group of dudes who got banned for being homophobic shitbirds right at the start, I guess, but I think the verdict was already delivered to those people. So.
---
You got 1,500 wood you're willing donate?
---
Derp. You do realize that Bethesda has released more than one game, right? I own most of them, and I still don't believe what they say until there is proof. You can be a witless fanboi all you want, but Bethesda won't respect you in the morning.
---
I think of it like a mail box in a REAL sense. Not privately sending something to a pal. You put things in you raise the flag to signal things are there, things get taken. 
---
I literally cannot play without mentioned mod!
---
Even though I can do those minigames fast, I hate them, they are a repetitive boring chore. In FO4, I use a mod that lets me one-click them with the appropriate level. After doing those chores literally thousands of times, I deserve that courtesy as a player.
---
So in 76, I don't bother with locked doors, safes, or terminals unless it's absolutely required by a quest. There's almost never anything good in them to make it worth my time. Changing perk card loadouts just to open a stupid lock is such a mind-numbing, meta-game, immersion-breaking Bad Design decision it makes me question their entire design process.
---
It's the minority high level players I'm referring to that tend to complain. Not every game's going to last forever, don't try to squeeze blood from it, especially since it's a new release. Like I said, just wait and return especially with all the balancing issues.

I honestly expected this game to be a train wreck from the start, so it's not much of a surprise. That it went down the way it did. Should I expect more for my money? Yes, especially from a AAA company, but curiosity got the better of me. Also, I doubt pay to win will be implemented, people that made their stance on that clear about.
---
I actually brought up this point previously, but I'm sure it got lost somewhere on this sub without being noticed. But anywho. I think the perk card system as a whole sounded like a decent idea to them at first, but I really just think it would have been better if they had left the system how it was in fallout 4 and just made everything passive basically...
---
What is happening is nothing new, as with the old newspaper industry of the 20th century, bad news sells.

It’s not just fallout 76, it’s just what YouTube is in 2019. Bringing back 2007 YouTube would be a blessing

Bruh we invested hundreds of hours into the game..I was averaging a good number of hours playtime daily ..made new friends everday due to trades..now I don't even log in..if you don't feel that this company didn't give us the middle finger I don't know what to tell u..it's now backlog season

I bought Red Dead, last year's #1 bestseller &amp; critical GOTY, and gave up an hour out of the snow. I did this to return to 76, which, in my opinion, has better user interactions with the world, a more intuitive inventory system, and mission replayability 
---
Now let me state upfront, RDR2 is the most beautiful (in terms of photorealistic fidelity) looking game I've ever played. Unequivocally. But that's it's main trick. As a game, rather than a well written movie made in UNREAL, it felt like a chore. You can have beautiful cutscenes but gameplay matters, that's why Kojima always made Metal Gear Solid games fun to play if you did the cutscenes. But he's a prodigy. 
---
Shooting through the train in the RDR2 robbery mission was less enjoyable, not to mention less challenging, than GoldenEye's 'Train' 25 years ago on the N64. It has brilliant AI, the level has variety, and the polygonal Sean Bean looks awesome. RDR2 you get off the horse, which is cool, then go through the train; up &amp; down through all the movie tropes.
---
It's what Rockstar has been doing for nearly 20 years. "Here's an awesome scene from x movie, and here's as close to reenacting it you can get without being indicted or killed". It's a good model. Vice City ends with you reenacting the end of Scarface, in a nearly perfect recreation of Tony Montana's mansion. They moved to their own ideas with GTA IV, and to a lesser extent San Andreas, but the gameplay loop (drive / walk to objective marker, kill or steal thing in vacinity of objective marker, drive / walk from objective marker). That's what GTA V/VI were &amp; RDR2 essentially is. This is where the problem lies, as graphics improve, their replayability decreases.
---
To put it in Manichaean terms, Rockstar is Bethesda's antithesis. RSG's open world's exemplify what Paul Tassi's attacked the creation engine for lacking, viz. graphical fidelity, but looting the aforementioned train is clunky. I would argue it's bad game design. Fallout 76's system for looting is not just comparatively awesome to RDR2's, but is the best I've ever used, outside of clicking with a mouse. This is as a direct result of the dynamism of the creation engine.
---
I say this because there is a perfectly explicable reason for BGS to perpetuate their engine. It can be used to quickly mock up new content, which is a plus in terms of creating quests &amp; areas, but the trade off is any bugs in Bethesda's library of functions and structures come along for the ride. That seems to be one the company has been willing to take, but from here on out presumably won't. (Long term, putting the engine up to a public attack might be a blessing by helping isolate legacy flaws in their engine; meaning future Creation iterations will be more stable &amp; potentially support fidelity improvements.) I mention this because the variety of the game's quest, world, and enemy design come as a direct result of the engine they would have to throw away to rebuild. (If you say, "we'll they should just rebuild some of it, and keep what works", that's exactly what a game engine does.)
---
Fallout 76 is an MMO, which always look a generation behind, compare Enter the Matrix to the Matrix Online, which both came out around the same time. The MMO looked worse. Nuking the Cranberry Bog &amp; fight the SBQ with the server. Best online experience of my life. 
---
Fallout 76 is the base version of the Fallout MMO. If fighting the queen is what BGS start the MMO with, I'm super excited for what's next. 
---
Meanwhile RDR2 sits in silence.
---
U sure it wasn't u?
---
People who are claiming they were banned for no reason say they did nothing wrong. As someone who actually hasn't done anything wrong, my account looks like someone who did nothing wrong.
---
I had a visitor to my camp about an hour ago, we realised that we were neighbours so I celebrated by firing off some artillery fireworks for us to watch while we sat on his couch.
---
Go do your homework you edgy edgelord. 
---
Well for starters none of them showed any proof they even got banned in the first place.
---
Came here to say that. 
---
It would be lovely to have only two perks sets, but one is the "camp/workshop/trainstation" one and it's automatically setup when you are in range. The other one loads when you leave those safe areas. 
---
Hey, y'all fence sitters? You don't have to have faith in Bethesda to realize that other people can lie to you. Bethesda can screw up all day long but that doesn't magically take away the ability for other people to lie for their own gain. Dupers and those who receive benefit from dupers have reason to lie. 
---
Especially if you've already gotten 60+ hours of gameplay.  I get with wanting to at least get your money's worth from it but I don't get having  completed everything, maxed out their character and continuing to grind away while saying it's terrible.  Move on to another game.
---
Don't have strange in numbers, but thanks. The "hotfix" seemed to make it normal again.

that would be a lot better of a list if you had of put (level) in brackets beside them lol along with their S.P.E.C.I.A.L letter.

What do you mean not being able to drop? If I accidentally pick up a legendary I'm stuck with it forever? How does that make sense? Your stash will be full of legendaries in 3 days. Making them scrappable won't solve duped item sales too.
---
Wow sounds like once again those guys were just lying out there asses. They were either cheating or point whoring. Then again I thought these same people stopped playing the game after realizing it was bad 500+ hours in.... 
---
Why? You can't possibly believe that all the negativity from their passionate community will have no effect on future sales. 76 has a very real chance of permanently damaging the profits of a company that has been stretched to the point of ridiculousness by the milking of Skyrim for every platform under the sun including Amazon Alexa. Bethesda has two main money-making IPs, and one of them is on the verge of irreparable damage. 
---
that is a SOLID list I already have Contractor and a few others the fact I can build for half the price is amazing.
---
All Rifles and Shotguns are horrible now.
---
I mean, google is a thing man. I dont know when I got them but you asked and they are very helpful. Most crafting are INT, white knight is AGI. Finding stuff is PER.

Uh... I haven't duped anything?
---
And if I had duped things, I wouldn't have chosen a 1 star furious combat shotgun, a two shot bolt action pipe rifle, a 2 star explosive combat rifle with troubleshooter, a 3 star baseball bat, and a suppressors gatling plasma cannon as the weapons to keep.
---
You’re right. This proves he/she wasn’t going to steal your items. Never have I been so wrong.

Still no TSE, just an explosive legendary, plus don't tell tse are useless to, what's the point of farming then?

It can be done on PC. I do not know eddy they didn't add it onto consoles. 
---
yeo so it seems.
---
Yeah just keep watching Anthem especially after this weekend. 
---
I’ll try that thanks :)
---
No if you are carrying that much you will not be able to pick anything up or loot coins.
---
I think they messed it up, some places where the old stash was are now empty, and places where there's one of the new stash they often only give 1 cap
---
New River Gorge Bridge East or South to Flatwoods up the Hill
---
Anything that's quicker than going into the perk menu and swapping the cards one by one would be an improvement. 
---
I mean, if I could be reasonably sure that I had, say, cleared out a building of enemies, it would be fine if I then wanted to take a bit of time to swap to my "detective" set i.e. Picklock, Hacker etc. and proceed to loot in peace. But since I know that enemies can respawn around me if I stick around too long, I would be a lot happier with some kind of quick-swap option. 
---
I agree with having a short cooldown, to reduce "hot-swapping" back and forth in combat and that sort of thing. 
---
Hmm. I haven’t done these quests yet. I’ll have to get to it. 
---
Picture is a little blurry.
---
Some are still super powerful..but not mine..I'm curious to where they are dropped from
---
The above comments are fairly accurate. always be careful of scammers but overall I've had a very good experience on the subreddit. It's one of my main ways of making caps in the game. 
---
my main recommendation if you pursue it is to get used to the pricing syntax in format of the subreddit. But overall I have meant nothing but good people through it. it's funny because you will often times post looking for something or trying to sell something in particular and you will often run into the same people - I noticed since I have previous messages from them on Xbox live even though they didn't make an attempt to find me for this particular item (I just happened to run into them again). My point being that there is a lot of good active users on there. 
---
And now I fear doing it. 
---
Welcome to Detroit, city of I ain't paying u shit again
---
That is why enable scrapping of legendary items.. that way if you don't want/need it, you can scrap it and get mats from it to sell. 
---
Did you not read what I said?  No selling, no trading, no dropping.   The only way to get rid of a legendary item would be to destroy it by scrapping it. 
---
That would stop the legendary duping dead in its tracks.
---
You got 110 hours go quit then money is already well spent 
---
Clearly that's a lie. You gotta understand it by now, man.
---
why not just have lockpick / hacker be a tiered card - so Standard unlocks lvl 1 - Expert 1 and 2 - Master 1 2 3 
---
this would let me slot Lockpick master and unlock all the doors with only 1 point of card - it wouldn't even be a difficult change in the way perk cards work and we would have the ability to lockpick and hack without the need to card swap from damage as we only need 1 point per card 
---
The tears of the banned are so delicious. We're talkin' chilled Nuka Cola good.
---
please reply to this comment if they give us an update, so I’ll know to come back.
---
Yes, my friend is on ps4, and when we talked about what duping was doing to the game, he stopped duping that day (Jan 11). I'm a PC gamer and I am an active player in spite of running out of things to do other than boring events.  You can look up my username of you are on pc and have some doubt. I understand that Bethesda can't tolerate cheating on an online game. My question is why they would ban all future purchases of single player games too.
---
As with most things(imo) it depends on the kid. My daughter is 13 and we laughed and laughed the first time I showed her how to blow the head off a super mutant corpse.  If she was a bit younger perhaps I wouldnt. If she were my nephew when he was 13 I probably would not get him into the game just to avoid saturation since shooters is the only games he played. Some kids can be negatively affected by this stuff.  I would defer to the parent.
---
well another balance option would be for explosive weapons to only add explosion to the first bullet making it a AOE but the 2nd bullet is just standard munitions lowering the total damage but giving a more direct hit alternative 
---
Wow as much as I'm in that area I never came across this
---
There's always an addictol at the Morgantown Airport in the medical hangar

---
Oh!! Thank you so much for this! 
---
Oof. Rough night, drunk Bethesda programmer? Please read the full post, it's about distribution of high levels with very low. Can't help your anger. 
---
Not dropping it is a bad idea. Say I pick up a heavy legendary weapon in the middle of nowhere and get over encumbered . No workbench around. Why should I be forced to carry it around, and possibly walk all the way to my camp, which may be all the way on the other side of the map.
---
I updated right as you were typing this. I am not banned, just as I expected.
---
Drop it in a large lake.
---
What does glow sight do? The mod?
---
thanks anyway
---
The helmet comes from the corpse sitting on the wheelchair on the porch of the Pumpkin House. The MantaMan suit comes from the Atom Shop (800 atoms).
---
If course it's a lie. This experiment was to prove that.
---
I used to love on the World of Warcraft forums when people would claim they'd been banned for something innocuous and a Blizzard employee would actually out them for the real reason they got banned. Bethesda should do that here too, some of these pity party ban threads have gotten a lot of attention and sympathy from people believing them.
---
found a vampire flamethrower last night on my new player someone had just dropped gave it to my heavy weapons guy (hugs flamer) my preciousssssss 
---
that said fuels a pain for that thing to craft in bulk 
---
Good bye good riddance this is not the place for your BS 
---
also can you combine pack rat and strong back and they stack?
---
As this is game is set in Merica, why not use Road hazard symbols. Less difficult to translate to different languages. 
---
O = circle green (go)
---
/\\ = circle green (caution)
---
\# = hexagon red (stop, ending)
---
Colorblind options can be more than just a palate swap.  
---
so strong back+pack rat a good combo?
---
I know many people like you and myself who just bypass locked items.  It obviously would have been unthinkable in fallout 4 to pass up a locked safe but since i dont usually get anything good out of them its a time/effort calculation.   If I get something worth the effort once every 10 locked safes/desk/whatever that I open, is the time it takes to swap out cards, pick the lock, and swap back to cards, worth the 1 time I get something decent?  The answer is no imo.
---
Repairing mine actually helped this
---
Yes, I've experienced a significant crit nerf since previous patch including this and the fact that crits no longer contribute to crit meter building.
---
This kind of perks should simply be bonus for high special , not perk cards
---
It's not just the gauss rifle. Many weapons are like that.
---
Welcome to the world of triple A games.
---
If u like WS melee is kind of lame..I'm just done playing for a while
---
Or just sell it since your buddy seems like he has a dense mod on his head slot.
---
On the off chance that you did get banned, you should have had proof ready that you were innocent. Got downvoted yesterday for suggesting that. Anyway, it's good that you did this experiment, now we have conclusive ptoof that crafting is not a ban worthy offense, and that 99.9% chance that all those allegations were indeed false. Well done, friend. 
---
I suggest you make a fresh post as well to draw attention to the result.
---
The disappeared turret on the ground will show up after you move your camp.  The only way ive learned to recover my turrets is to make sure they are placed on a mat or other object.  Its a real pain for sure when that happens.
---
The dev room masks are entirely different, yeah. That one is safe. :)
---
There was a 50 GB day 1 patch after the beta.
---
Would you care to show me examples of them lying to you? Remember, a lie is an intentional falsehood, so you'll need to show me not only what you feel was lied about, but proof that they (BGS) did it intentionally to mislead.
---
No theories, no speculation, no assumptions, no emotions. Just good old actual proof.
---
Cheaters fucking suck, your friend deserves this.
---
how about the queen drops nothing and the quest completion gives the entire reward of her loot pile + normal reward so we don't even have to find the corpse or to those unlucky few who get caught with the never ending now loading loot pile 
---
then if it takes someone 5mins to get quest completion they don't have to stand looking at the pile or running around looking for the mini pile 
---
Never did this once..maxing 1400 caps daily is a breeze
---
Thanks. I'm not crazy.
---
Would appreciate if Bethesda rebalanced this, even if it's not as powerful as before. Make it useful at least.
---
Do Light Metal Arm plans exist?
---
This needs way more likes ya know. 
---
Next to the white springs station there is a raider tower and a bunch of debris feels very raider like no water though but honestly that’s a dumb requirement water is so common you get if from every even just put two our three small purifiers in the dirt and done. Also next to the white springs station and black water mine you will get a ton of traffic which I would think out weighs not having a large water purifier. Although of your determined to have you water purifier by the top of the world train station/pleasant valley areas has a great location that is raider like and is heavy traffic and has water on a highway so it’s great to build. 
---
Sadly, this read is more enjoyment than I get from playing the game in its current state.
---
Xb1
---
Yes I notice it when I am boiling a lot of dirty water n I have spoiling food in my inventory. But it seems to just be the sever catching up, tapping slightly slower should help.
---
legendarys should just give items directly to any player that kills them like a quest reward they could just have running in background a quest that is like
---
kill 1 star legend reward 1 star random legendary 
---
this way anyone who hits it doesn't have to roam around looking through any piles we just look at the item and drop it if we don't want it 
---
That's how it worked in previous Fallout games too. I wonder why they changed it.
---
It extends to mutations aswell, 37% bonus melee damage up from 25%
---
So the "Canvas" bags marketed as part of Fallout 76's Power Armor Edition aren't related to Fallout 76? You must be awesome at mental gymnastics...
---
Lol would get nuked a bit much doncha think?
---
i literally just made a post saying to buff alllllll weapon types so they can be viable end game
---
This. I used quite a lot of bobbleheads that i found looking for magazines. After the update this challenge popped up and i was already at 35/60.then at the end of that same session it was done. 
---
That's good to hear, glad to hear people who've been cheating their stocks of Nuka Cola will be banned, I'm a pretty avid collector of them and I only have a couple hundred bottles
---
Chems my man, Chems.   Buffout, and a little creative inventory management should get you light enough to fast travel to a place where you can scrap it.
---
But seriously, Dropping an item into a bag or a container is one of the key parts of most duping methods.  By disabling that, you cut out a major way of duping.
---
Where's the location? 
---
Well the thing is, people really like the game so they get frustrated when things dont go well myself included. I think people are just venting. I've never made a post like that myself but ive totally said I was going to quit out of angerr before. 
---
Floors can't be destroyed? Really?
---
Don't forget that weapon degradation seems to be on shot,  not on damage dealt so that plinking is going to break your weapon faster. 
---
Some feedback regarding stimpacks
---
1. Ability to unbind from the rigth DPAD button
---
2. If you go to use a stimpack when at full (or max due to rads) health then dont let me use it
---
Lost a lot of them due to accidentally clipping the button when in a fight
---
Well I could do without the large purification 
---
Outside watoga
---
LOL.
---
Melee guy says one shot isn't everything.
---
I know melee guy.....I know......git gudder.
---
It’s like they think complaining to random people is going to prove they’re innocent. I guess it might’ve been for attention. 
---
I just don’t know you could be carrying 100k pounds of duped items and then assume you were banned because of mass crafting
---
Yeah. Ultimately I decided, "this is something I do by default. This is something that probably every single player does at some point, if not multiple times every play session. If it was just for simply mass crafting we'd be seeing more folks reporting this instead of the handful that is out there".
---
It's a numbers game, baby. Don't even need faith in Bethesda to come to this conclusion!
---
I still use one 
---
Auto looting in a MP game isn't a good idea. Very prone to exploitation. Someone kills stuff, others just hang around stealing loot. That'd make farming impossible, especially in Nuke Zones. Also, you'll be profiting off others' labour, *and that sounds a lot like communism*. 
---
Especially as on ps4 there's a tendency for the game to crash when using the pip boy or perk selection screen. I don't want to take that risk and lose the workshops I have
---
Do other company’s have to do all this extra bull crap tho? 
---
Or tie it to actually using the skill... More locks you pick the better you get at it.  Could work for a lot of things really.
---
I somehow picked up a full set of raider armor doing roses quest.
---
I know I didn’t intentionally pick 1 up while wrapping up the uplink library thing but it magically appeared  and bam! 3 full sets! 
---
The two I carry + 1
---
It was too high for me to wear at the time so I pitched it lolz
---
Yeah I usually just bounce between WS, west tek, and some of the high volume enemy events like the hordes/uranium fever/awol armaments
---
We still need a way to refund our hard earned levels when you do major balancing nerfs! This is a common problem for MMOs, most I've dealt with automatically refund points as part of the patch that nerfs things, and some, like ESO, allow a refund of attribute and skill points using the in game currency at any time. The leveling reallocation you've put in game is NOT even close to enough, because you broke my build, it could take me 80-100 more levels to BOTH reallocate AND buy new perks. Also, don't put the fix in the Atom Shop, it needs to be placed somewhere easily accessible like Vault 76 and cost next to nothing in caps, and it needs to not only reset our SPECIAL points but also allow us to re-pick our perks.
---
Don't even have to be near the workshop! I got wrecked by someone who traveled entirely across the map to do so.
---
Ive been saying this for weeks! Should be this way for all "boss" creatures they introduce.
---
Game sucks is why
---
IMO it's a question of how often does someone need to use lockpick vs something else in that tree like Rifleman or Commando etc, 5% of the time for lockpicking vs 95% something else much more useful??  It seems wasteful to tie up 3 lockpick pts 95% of the time.  The loadout idea like choose a Lockpick Macro in a different Favorite Wheel to do lockpicking and then revert back to perhaps a Rifleman Macro when done...boom...problem solved.
---
Same for a gazillion other cards like Dromedary for when you need to drink and only when you need to drink, Pharma for searching medicine cabinets blah blah etc etc ad infinite
---
So yeah, make this another request for Perk Card loadout Macros on a Favorite Wheel
---
thanks!
---
Yes I was pitching them awhile back not sure now since this last patch 
---
To be fair, he also includes a fair bit of his alt-right leanings in his videos. I'm pretty sure he thinks Anita Sarkeesian is on the Fallout 76 dev team (which gets her insurance for Anthony Weiner's love child).
---
Sorry for the near-political rant, it just pisses me off that YouTube assumes gamer=incel reactionary. I constantly get recommends for TheQuatering and similar channels' videos.
---
Then I would recommend placing your camp in between black water mine and white springs station. In the road is a raider tower and debris and has a great raider feel like a road block kinda feel. It’s a super hot spot for every one making trading rounds and great for when a nuke drops on white springs the train station is never hit and every one uses that as a fast travel hot spot so your camp would be busy every nuke launch/ uranium fever event. Had my camp there for awhile but decided I needed an acid extractor more. 
---
What if I am over encumbered *after* doing Buffout/booze? That keeps me stuck. Also, why would by forced to leave an area just to be able to move properly? I could make a thousand more arguments against this idea.
---
There can be ways to handle duping, but sticking them in your inventory isn't it. 
---
I began my character Melee, then half melee and half shotgun and then and respec totally shotgun (90 % finished today). I use melee now only when I'm surrended by mobs or when a melee guy comme to close... So think what you want 
---
lmao yea indeed, act like they legit farmed 2 million nuka colas...       
---
       
---
But one point is confusing to me: Halloween Candy. It's not rare and I get around 2k candies per run or like 6k per hour. It takes some commitment but it's definetly far from impossible to gather 500k Candies within 30 days. In the first month I probably farmed 200-250k too. And I farmed West-Tek, Sugar Grove &amp; a few other spots before I server hopped for the next Monster Mash run.      
---
      
---
In case you're curious - those 5k rewardd seem to be only 1* legendaries. I spent most my candies for those in hope to get a 2* or 3* legendary, but no :/

Don't. Tell. Anyone.
---
A fair bit, as in, all his bullshit. 
---
Locking legendary items to the original owner is a really good idea. I think it makes a great suggestion.
---
If support told you to scrap it and you get the schematic to create
---
Why wouldn’t you just delete and make a legit one?
---
Unfortunately they don't seem to comment on any post like this that needs recognition.

You're directions make no sense. For anyone looking it's directly South of the Overseers Camp. Just at the feet of the bird on the map.
---
 Or you can go directly North from the New River Gorge Resort.

 Spent some time searching "South of New River Gorge Bridge East" 
---
The state of gamers and gaming when i can't even believe this story. Not just anyone can go do a silo, you know. You have to have done a bunch of other stuff first. If your son was only level 12, i seriously doubt he's done enough to even get in the silo. I call bullshit.
---
Wow I just love how people downvote an idea without consideration of its validity simply because it was an idea THEY didn't come up with. They probably turn around and repost the same thing too. 
---
I began my character Melee, then half melee and half shotgun and then and respec totally shotgun (90 % finished today). I use melee now only when I'm surrended by mobs or when a melee guy comme to close case TSE keep kille me when too close... So think what you want 
---
They want the individual to play their other games, the thought that the crap online game we pushed out should dictate how one should proceed with our future purchases would be so short sighted Bethesda would be pulling a capitalistic Dodo move. Further more the problem continues to compound when it is Bethesda's support infrastructure itself that is abysmal and horrid. No phone line for customer support? 4 days to get back to you starting hour zero and if we don't get back to you it is your fault even if it was ours? We can lock down your content across platforms owned by different companies entirely.. period, that is so overtly anti consumer that it has to be illegal no matter the fine print within a EULA.  
---
No he's pretty sad that he can't play anymore and was even willing to buy the game again.
---
Go near a fissure site and try to dump the bag in the fissure
---
Wow it’s about time that someone figured this out. Brilliant!
---
I know this is out of the question, because so many things would have to change, but I think the game would be better without VATS. 
---
Now you can tell me to go VATS myself.
---
No... just stating facts, there are numerous issues with this game all caused by Bethesda and their ineptness and inability to do an online game, and rushing it for greed
---
It’s not bad to ask for things even if they can’t fix the broken ones. They should honestly be able to do both. 
---
Doesn't help that you cant loot anything and the sbq body can go meat pile before you even get the loot to pull from server.
---
Corpse loot is instanced.  If you loot something from a corpse, the other person who tagged the kill or is on your team can loot the same.  Corpse for their own different loot. 
---
Like the other guy, I've only experienced this since the recent patch. If it happened before, it wasn't noticable to me.
---
I gotta admit though, I’ve seen a lot of unbalanced games but Fallout 76 takes the cake. Many of the weapons that are barely usable because of their damage for some reason also have some of the worse durabilities. 
---
Meanwhile all shotguns and rifles seem like they have a normal durability level for a Fallout game, while also being some of the best choices gun wise. 
---
Then they nerf TSE (understandably), but leave melee weapons dealing 3k+? The balance decisions for this game just don’t make any sense. 
---
Duping isn't only anout Legendaries. Damn, most of the time is just about materials - and that has already been fixed, *and* the exploiters banned, as it should be.
---
Yeah, you can call exploiting by other names like "tinkering", but it doesn't change the fact that it's against ToS. I'm glad these people are getting banned, and hopefully they will never come back.
---
duplicate lol....oops, am I banned?
---
Yes. Please!
---
This. I get that voting is a form of opinion, but it's used so often to control the narrative and people obviously can't think for themselves and make choices based on facts.
---
They don't think they were banned for mass crafting, they think if they go on the forums and claim &amp; complain that they were banned for mass crafting that they might be able to get unbanned.
---
Auto loot doesn't not have to make loot free for all.
---
I’ve got all my light metal plans as random plan spawns and loot.  Never found them pre or post patch at a vendor.  
---
I don't know. I support the idea of it being there because I get where they were coming from with it. They didn't want fans of the previous games pissed about its exclusion. That and not everyone is a super hardcore fps player that can reliably aim headshots 100% of the time.  On that point, I am just playing devil's advocate because I have been playing fps games since I was a child. 
---
This would help with nuke zones
---
Oh I see. It was unclear
---
Pray I do not alter the deal any further.
---
I'd love to just be able to see my char offline
---
Y E S, but not just 2-3 slots, you have the wheel for Fav for Emotes AND on Emotes you press Q to expand a slot sooooooooooooo do that Emote Wheel for like all of those so that future asks won't be "hey can you add more slots to the fav wheel(s)?"
---
thank you
---
I don't run a rifle build but I'll throw in my 2 cents anyway.
---
If you haven't yet, finish Mayor for a Day and pick up a LVL 50 All Rise, it has -90% reduced weight and +10 health just incase you're a bit too close to the enemy or you run out of ammo.
---
Bethesda is not taking the blame for this... that much is clear. They will not admit to the travesty this game is, the state of launch, the anti consumer move to Bethesda launcher only, the dwindling player base. I can only wait to see what the PVP server population will do to the base game when it splits the thousands of players it has left. They wanted a Destiny. They made a  Destiny 2 pre Activision split. I can only speculate that Starfield was so far from done that they needed something to get them to its release until then and so 76 was born. 
---
Stop giving them god damned ideas!!
---
1500 ain't a lot of wood lol
---
Let see the build. The fact that you posted this without showing the build already makes you look like your doing something shady. Perception is everything. 
---
...to hell?
---
Oh and I kind of agree at times... I find it sincerely annoying that there is a bit of lag time with vats' target acquisition so that despite me having a 95% chance to hit, I miss my first shot like 20% of the time. I have probably blown though so much ammo due to this issue that life without vats would have been easier. 
---
Would I need to hit level 50 first to get a level 50 reward?
---
I have been holding out on my treasure maps for example.
---
Well it's only slap damage, you'll be 9kay
---
Man, this is all so good, but we'd have to get a bigger camp budget and I bet that'd be a bitch, sooooo...
---
I propose, when it comes to clutter and decorative stuffs, these better alternate forms of things, there should be a new budget bar separate from the base building one... I guess just a "clutter" bar, or "decorative" bar. That way, can keep the same base building budget, but specialized decorative or alternate forms of stuff also apply to a clutter bar budget, keeping it all relatively balanced and controlled.
---
Good to hear it, soldier.
---
The marine combat helmet is fine, it’s in game all over the place. Marine Armor Helmet on the other hand is undetermined. 
---
Had that same problem once when I was addicted to Fury. Is the Vault Boy on the stats menu of the pip boy sad?
---
If your friend actually found the TSE himself or bought it from someone who found it then I have no problem leaving the damage as it was pre-nerf. From someone who has played solo self-found from the start to level 108, there were just too many people running around killing every thing in sight with their ill gotten gains. Something needed to be done.
---
I don't much like the perk system anyway, I would have preferred them bringing back a skill tree of sorts than having a magical card tell me I am or not good at something. But that's the system they gave us so they need to make it as convenient as possible to allow us to switch our perks out if that's what they intended, Even if it's set to a timer, Also loadouts, 2 will do one for combat one for when you are passively exploring for the picklocking etc...
---
sweet that narrows it down and I don't really like to google while playing the game it can get you killed maybe I will just make a custom doc and copy and past all the info you posted along with the actual levels etc 
---
Very much this. Its rather terrible. Many of my friends dont even pick up armor because they never leave their PA. That means the only good loot for them is weapons.
---
When I get surrounded by mobs I used to use 200 rounds of ammo to clear them out. Now that my gun went from 180 DMG to 60 DMG I use 600 rounds to clear them out and then I need to go farm for ammo for the next hour.
---
I've got an OP sledge also. Melee is easy mode!!!....no ammo to grind and I can one shot practically anything. The problem is that melee us boring. That's why the OP doesn't see any of his friends playing anymore.
---
Quite the nice place, though I gotta ask; what's with the laminate flooring not all going the same way? It let's down the rest of your CAMP
---
Ok, so it had a reason. But a total ban for all and everything is a bit to hard. I would try to politely contact Support, be honest that I did something wrong and try to get the ban reduced to just f76. If they are in a good mood maybe even more can happen ...
---
I have a TSE handmade, fully modded out, with one perk in rifleman (I use PA and heavy weapons) and it still does 100+ damage a shot. Good for crippling low level mobs that run at me
---
This is just ridiculous if this was intentional. The only time the perk seemed broken was on shotguns, but if they were concerned about that they should’ve just changed it from having a chance to proc on every pellet to one chance per shot. 
---
yeh iv done a few trades ..so far every one has been honest.. 
---
For quest rewards like the Black Diamond and All Rise, yes. As for the maps, I'm not entirely certain, I haven't done much treasure hunting
---
This really only works away from home: Before you scrap everything at a workbench, move all your bulked items into the nearest container that isn't a stash. Don't drop them on the ground, those will disappear too quickly if you take too long to craft. Scrap all junk, then hit R to view that container from before, hit R again to take all.
---
Yep, a lot of other MMO's do this for rare items, either character or account lock.  And since Bethesda does not provide a native way to transfer from characters on your account, doing a character lock would be the most logical.
---
Worst part of all this is the mass proliferate of TSE and +15% Standing armors would have been stopped by a lockdown of legendary items.  And so much grief, avoided. 
---
Well I only spent a couple minutes on it, but marsupial definitely makes it harder. I took some Rad X to suppress it. I think I might want it on for that last jump into the tower tho. Unfortunately I have to run for now, so I'll try and finish it later.
---
Side note: doing it in first person is hard. Doing it in third person /should/ be more practical, but the camera gets hung up on all kinds of weird shit like trees and effectively renders you blind half the time. Wtf.
---
1 is impossible not unless you talk to every player in the entire map
---
Go to the road side ice cream store north west of vault 76.  Kill all of the super mutants, ghouls, scorched or what ever spawns there. Then follow the road heading down hill from the ice cream shop.  When you see an over turned bus, you are near the Random Event Spawn Point Everyone Can Treasure (RESPECT).  If you see a responder protectron with a pac bhraman, it is the vendor that has a chance to sell the coat.  I recommend you take a friend and just server hop until one of you find it.  Then take turns logging out and back in (join your friends session) and see if he has the coat.  Doing it by yourself will be painful.  Or I can sell you mine . . . For 15k caps. ;)
---
A friend of mine once accidentally overwrote my mario 64 save file, I felt like killing him at the time. 
---
Well I live there everyday 
---
yeh.if i tap slower it  not too bad
---
No fret fellow dweller this problem has at least been noticed by Bethesda yesterday with my post
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am1f1z/make_missile_launchers_and_fatmans_great_again/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Hopefully it'll fix them in no time without nerfing anything else in the process, fingers crossed with this one
---
I'd either drop them in a vendor spot like Whitesprings for someone to pick up, or use a Tesla Rifle to slowly whittle the number down. If you really wanna be free of them, use a Salvaged Assaultron Head to fire them all at once with the bug.
---
I'm getting so so fast at swapping these. But yeah, there's a number of interface changes that could make it smoother without even going to preset decks. Let me hide cards I never use. Let me left scroll from Strength to Luck. Always resort the equipped perks alphabetically. Maybe let me lock equipped perks I never swap.  
---
I'm so glad they nerfed everything.
---
Yeah for sure. I use a revolver and the perk no longer procs since the last patch.
---
Practically any mutation or anything in the Aid tab is effected by +50% effectiveness. It's very nice for food and waters
---
No one is making you read or reply to this post. Move on with your life - it looks pathetic whining about something online, especially when it's just a post on Reddit. 
---
I don't know why I even still had it moping around my SSD. I was not going to open the Bethesda launcher again. 
---
Played anthem demo, it’s trash.
---
vey !
---
good bughtesda boy !
---
Perception perk, more damage to glowing ones 
---
Agreed, Duping is not all about legendary items, but it is the key factor in the outside cash for items market, and it is what has corrupted the in game economy.   Locking these items down to the player that picks them up would cause that part of the market to come to a screeching hault.  Leaving only mats, and chems-like-items to be dealt with.
---
The vilification of the very community those 'tinkerers' astounds me, considering they are the very people who have kept the modding community alive.  Bethesda would have never had the following it did without those people. 
---
How about they implement spin attack from Zelda?
---
Got my first TSE drop yesterday. Lvl 35 pump action... haven
---
There's this dude on the /r/Fallout discord who keeps getting banned for trying to RMT (Real Money Trade, against the rules) for items in game. So he likes to come on his many different alt accounta, expose minors to hardcore pornography, shitpost, and spam links to his accounts on RMT sites. People related to rhis game seem tp have really negative reactions when caught in the wrong.
---
Yes please please please please
---
I'm referring to today's YouTube video from Juicehead where he discusses those who were banned months ago for using mods or whatever other reason, who claimed their bans were in error, but are still banned. He discusses his theory as to why appeal tickets may be lost in the system. I have no sympathy for the banned homophobes.
---
He can lie about his info to create a new account under his family for example. 
---
He probably deserved the ban though
---
We talked about shotguns not other rifles. I admit that the nerf might be a pain in the ass for those who have auto rifles for example but for shotgun and even gatling gun (I have these 2) it's not, in my point of view. Not the same with a minigun for sure for example I admit 
---
Easy, drop something..   And you know... if you see a large, heavy weapon, try examining it before you pick it up.. that way you will know if it's actually worth lugging it across the map.  No one says you have to pick something up if you're already low on carry weight.
---
Another significant problem introduced in the recent patch (generally affecting stealth type characters) was a major crit nerf. Four Leaf Clover has had its proc chance lowered severely, and crits no longer contribute to filling the meter on the next crit. These changes were introduced in patch 5 without any notes, and they cause a major change in luck builds. It takes me three or four times as long to build crits now even with max luck and max 4LC.
---
Please tell the dev team to stop these kinds of nerfs which nobody is calling for (this one widens the gap between melee and ranged, for example, so it's counterintuitive), then making no notes about it. You all previously said that would stop.
---
If I'm being honest, the hit detection in this game is just kind of shit anyway. I have a game dvr video of me taking a 50m shot at a ghoul with the crosshairs steady on his nose and missing 3 times in a row, Just dumb.
---
Wow. I didn't know we could craft Halloween costumes. 
---
&gt; Except some people dont make very much money and can only afford maybe 1-2 new games a year.
---
Exactly this.
---
For some people, buying a new game they're hyped and excited for is a rare treat. For some, it was a choice between spending the next six months playing Fallout 76 OR RDR2. Since FO76 was promised to receive regular updates, of course be playable with friends, and getting eventual mod support, it should have had a long life. If you can get hundreds of hours out of Fallout 4, then surely getting the same out of 76 shouldn't have been a problem.
---
So yeah, for someone who might only be able to buy a new game once or twice a year, Fallout 76 being this awful should quite rightfully make them pissed.

Take this down sheesh an actual benefit and we post it x-x
---
It's the Marine TACTICAL Helmet that's fine.
---
Yesterday when I was playing alone I was walking around near the fissure site at Watoga and 4 scorched beasts spawned 
---
Tamed a deathclaw?
---
I was banned for crafting fucking ammo and handmade rifles to scrap them to get mods wtf is that? 
---
One week ago I thought (single-player) go launch a nuke and kill SBQ with the server. I entered Alpha and wondered about shooting noises. I found after the first barrier 2 random fellas in power armor (probably team). I watched them a little and from my perspective they looked like fresh in launching a nuke.
---
So I decide without chat (mic) I show them what to do.
---
The end of these meeting:
---
They launched the nuke ( whitesprings), 
---
I passed this time and did say goodbye with a smile on my face. 
---
I mean they probably did intend that. It should be kind of tedious so that you can't just magically be a different character with different skills based on the situation you're in. I think they should remove swapping all together or have a cool down every time to make more permanent builds. I leave level 3 lock pick on at all times because it's annoying to swap and I think that's the point.  
---
Now, I've never once found anything useful in those crates but I'll keep trying damnit
---
Since it's painfully obvious you've been doing nothing but the equivalent of covering your ears and shrieking at the top of your lungs instead of engaging in a discussion, I'm just going to post something random to get the same conversational effect.
---
Hi, Phil Swift here with Flex Tape! The super-strong waterproof tape! That can instantly patch, bond, seal, and repair! Flex tape is no ordinary tape; its triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly! Plus, Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas in water without draining them! Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers and RVs! Flex Tape is super strong, and once it's on, it holds on tight! And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions! Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holes. To show the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape! Not only does Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal, so the inside is completly dry! Yee-doggy! Just cut, peel, stick and seal! Imagine everything you can do with the power of Flex Tape!
---
poor tumblin tom...
---
When those "banned for crafting" post first started showing up, I immediately wanted to say I think you're *missing few* zeros in your quantity of items you created...duped. The method that they "claimed" to use that resulted in a ban is the same method I use for making ammo, soups, boiled water, etc. Yet I still have my PC &amp; XB accounts in good standing. I have recently started slowing down the button spam as I have learned that has some *issues* for others on the servers.
---
Glad to see my hunch was correct with the statement coming from Bethesda. 
---
20 - 30 items, really?!!   Only idiots would even try to prove it... 
---
For sure the plan?
---
I believe you. This game deserves criticism but not the constant stream of hate and lies it get. It's a unique and bizarre thing I've never seen before as a gamer. 
---
I usually just get myself off but if you want to help send me a pic first. Attraction is important. I am not into fisting, though. But I will piss on you if that turns you on.
---
Oh.  I apologize if I am wrong about this. 
---
I actually have a mail box at my base in white springs and I put a light on it with stickers that say” take some leave some” then every time I start my game session  I throw a few items in there for people to trade, so far no one has taken or left anything yet.. so before I log out I take everything back out and do it all over again, I hope it will help my fellow vault dwellers one day
---
New river gorge bridge east --&gt;OR SOUTH OF FLATWOODS 
---
sry but not sry
---
Yeah I guess stealth is going to be the alternative until they fix it. I don’t think they should be nerfing crit at all after the TSE nerf. 
---
They need to completely overhaul the game from balance to stability to abuse to content. They’ve fallen short on deaf ears to accommodate the casual minority, and have hurt a lot of their die hard fans in the process. This game started as a genuinely good game even with its bugs , at launch. Bugs aside the game was good, there’s no argument to that. But they’ve progressively made it worse and worse with each update. Changing balances and mechanics breaking the unnecessary and fixing the unwanted. Whoever is the team control of development, they’re doing a very poor job in terms of making an MMO/lite, and well if you’re out now I wouldn’t wait a few weeks or a month to come back. Come back in a year and see where it’s at. If nothing changes, move on and let it die.
---
well you can just look at the time line to see  that the goodbye letters seemed to stop all at once and shortly there after "Muh friends list"
---
haha Hamish.
---
You could see the energy drain out of him towards the end of each stream. Especially when the ended up doing the first incursion with some exploiters and he started deleting his gear to proof he didn't know it was an exploit that they'd used.
---
Again though, he understood that was what he was employed for. That was his role. If things got so bad they would have him interviewing a dev or two on the streams as well.
---
Point is, they tried. They knew the fucked up and tried to take some ownership off the problems and tried. They didn't just hide away expecting fanboi's to defend them whilst they watched there sales figures plummet.
---
If a company is breaking bad, they need to be made aware. This sub is the perfect place for that.
---
Wonder what young Hamish doing these days! He still over in Sweden or where ever it was they were based?
---
Agree, but would require some adjustment.  Like second rank of hacker would just be 2 in a single card but require 3 int to equip or have as passive. Rank 3 would be standalone but require 5 int to use as passive.  Similarly for lock picking. 
---
If there's no stat requirement sufficient, then someone could just take all these perks without having to make any sacrifice at all.
---
Drop them. Don’t hoard ammo it just takes up precious storage space and carry weight.
---
The leadership NEEDS TO STAND TRIAL, THIS GAMER KNOWS HOW TO RISE UP.
---
The only game I know will falsely ban you is Club Penguin, and that's been dead for a while. They never did explain why I got banned twice in a row despite only playing Cart Surfer :c
---
It’s multiplying negative effects as well. Which is why everyone is constantly hungry and thirsty.
---
Could the same sentiment be made for people who down vote factual criticism into obscurity?  Opinion lead to heated anonymous stupidity for sure and no one should attack anyone for their personal feelings or thoughts on a game. But, this Subreddit is or was notorious for closing their ears to constructive arguments. 
---
Love that he got banned. Don't cheat and you won't risk it.
---
I barely continue to play but I have to admit that it was some well spent moneys. Yes this game is dying but not every game can last for 5 years+ for 60$ (and I payed 30€ so it was really worth the investment).
---
Beat Saber is fucking amazing yo, it's also a fantastic workout. Keep playing that with your son
---
So, the adventure gave you wood? I know, I know.
---
Good lord! 
---
I hear Beat Saber is popular. Let me know how it is.
---
Ok cool thanks. 
---
Hey dumbass if I was doing something shady I wouldn't have posted it at all so back it up with the accusations second all you need is fireproof dense mod and dodgy.
---
I think it's also important to understand the context of the company and what they offer. 
---
* Destiny: What other games is Bungie currently supporting?  What other sources of income do they have?  Looking at their website I don't see any other games besides Destiny II currently.  
---
* No Man's Sky: What other games is Hello Games currently supporting?  What other sources of income do they have?
---
* Battlefront II: Is there any risk to losing the licensing agreement for Star Wars? 
---
Of the three examples, I would say Battlefront II is the closest example to where Bethesda is, Bethesda has other sources of revenue.  Fallout 76 is not their flagship game. For Bungie and Hello Games, The game in question is pretty much it.  
---
EA I would say is closest to Bethesda, though I would be interested to know if there are any licensing reasons that EA continues to support the game (If they didn't would they lose the license or pay a penalty to Disney). 
---
I'm not disagreeing that other games haven't had rocky starts, I just think it's important to understand context of the company and the game to understand if they are doing it because they Want to, or because they have to. 
---
I let it die after the first week. I found every aspect of this game unplayable by comparison to what else is on the market and past Fallout experiences. 
---
These are good points, and I think the answer is that for X amount of points in a stat you get 1 passive point.  Like 3:1  So if you have 9 end you can equip rank 3 lead belly as a passive. Or you can swap it in the active slot for just 3 end, but with a long cooldown on swapping so that it can't be done constantly.
---
Maybe Hamish will show up for Division 2? Who knows. 
---
Agree. They tried. Even if you give them a C for effort it’s better than what we have here. That’s what frustrates me. 
---
What did I do?
---
I am hating this game at the moment, but staying and paying for atom shop items in hope of a brighter future.  Hey, they could pull a no mans sky and turn it around in like a year and 9 months.
---
Yep. 
---
Same thing happened with me I've been playing Fallout since the first game was released. And since New Vegas they've gradually gotten worse. Now dont get me wrong I played and enjoyed Fallout 4 but it was always because of the modding community that filled in the voids left by Bethesda. But 76 the the last straw after saving money from my checks for 4 months to get the pre order, and the let down that it was. I wont be buying another Bethesda game again. I must admit the direction that Bethesda has taken saddens. 
---
dw bro i can feel it from here
---
I don't even think I got a week of playtime in this game before throwing in the towel. I was a huge Fallout fan too, but I just can't bring myself to play this game. 
---
I like it but can we just make pvp easier instead of hit and be hit back make it a proper dual like borderlands does it
---
Curing rad worms messes up everything.
---
I was getting it constantly when I had a targeting HUD equipped on my power armor. Other posts have said if you are playing with people who use the HUD or berry Mentats it can happen too.
---
If that’s not the culprit I got nuthin.
---
Yeah many games take years to get somewhat balanced, but so gar Ive never encountered a game where so many playstyles are just unusable. The way laser weapons work in FO76 is one of the worst things ive ever seen. 
---
There will always be a strongest build. Every game has that. Theres probably no way around it. But other playstyles should at least work for the casual gamer. And FO76 is far from it.
---
Those people weren't "tinkering" to get an advantage over other players or to get profits either in-game or even cash IRL. That's a huge difference.
---
By comparing modders to mere cheaters you are shaming them.
---
Bear Urine? Why did you pick that for your name?
---
I'll head off Bethesda CS for ya.
---
"We understand that finding that right piece of equipment is an important part of the 76 experience.  However, we regret to inform you that there is no way for us to verify that any equipment was lost and can not replace it.  For future reference, to help avoid situations like this; please direct your self to our pinned Known Issues thread on the Fallout 76 forums."
---
Sorry about your luck.  Also, just an FYI, if you don't spam the button to transfer items and look to make sure only the quest items are available before transferring all; you can avoid this.  I had this happen twice, the first time I was level 10 and I didn't lose anything of value.  The next time I was level 50+ and I saw the bug and just didn't click to transfer my equipment.
---
+1 Also where I got my Lever Gun plan.
---
How it feels to be on this train wreck instead of something reasonable 
---
Oh man the modding community for FO4 carried that game so much further than it’s predictable lifespan. Great community. 
---
You know what’s a great indicator is I turn on twitch and you can see not only the current hot games but also the true lifetime games like CS:GO and stuff. Where’s FO76? Gone. You have to search for it to fine like 8 streamers with maybe a few hundred viewers. Sad. 
---
Seriously. I know 2H is stronger, but screw it.
---
Typical Responder response. Ad Victoriam. 
---
You didnt need the full page sob story to simply say the thing went off map. Its a bug that breaks the game regardless of your first world problem. Idk how you can honestly make this most without seeing how ridiculous it is. You are disappointed because you had to go play something else with your kid on your virtual reality system? 
---
Mmmm. I disagree. And people who played it and spent money on it are only enabling companies like Bethesda to produce this garbage and know they’ll get money anyway
---
I had approx 2000 Scrap steel and decided to do my own experiment a few days ago .

I mashed the space-bar to create throwing knives. I used up all my steel scrapes, then scrapped my throwing knives into steel, the used that steel to craft more throwing knives, etc. All the while masking the space-bar.   
---
Day 5 or 6 , still not banned.
---
The Tesla Rifle is a great place to use them. Perfect for mobs in lower level areas- don’t really need to aim, and it can chain to take down multiple enemies.
---
What annoys me is that I actually *did* cheat and got literally no punishment, but my friend gets perma-banned for no reason in a months time.  
---
Just for clarification I used DNS codes in 2013 on the 360.
---
How so?
---
Yes, I did 
---
It seems I have backtracked on this deal for now.....
---
It all broke to the beginning of it, except Atomic Shop things. I cannot personally verify, since I refuse to reinstall it again. BUT, if you check out the mod fix changelog for it ([https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/2?tab=description](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/2?tab=description)), you will see the whole ultrawide support collapsed again.
---
&gt; Version 6: Updated to FO76 Version 1.0.5.10  
---
REPEAT OF PREVIOUS VERSION. Ground zero, rewrite, delete old, etc. Down to only 11 menus to change. w00t. 
---
Do you have a dense mod on your head in RL? I didn’t accuse you of anything in my post.  You make a post crying about getting reported and all I said was show the build. I’m well aware of how you shield yourself from the damage but obviously not many people are since you’re getting reported. A cave is an appropriate place for you Neanderthal-like brain. 
---
I'm sorry red dead 2 and kingdom hearts 3 are such let downs that you feel the need to come hea here and shit on fallout. Like it's an original thought or your distaste actually merits some discussion. Now that your done to log on fortnite cause your " one of the In crowds doing the trendy thing" see you at the table with the rare few who learned to tie their shoes ! * Thumbs up*
---
It's not south of flatwoods its North East. 
---
&gt; So you tell me, what do these servers do? Are they not tracking where each player is at any given moment? **Loading player assets they've built for how many players at any given moment? NPCs being tracked, voice files, in game event messages..** Jesus Christ, explain how this server isn't constantly sending traffic between it and every player on the server in a huge multitude of ways? 🤔
---
I mean, it's right there in your comment.  That was your whole justification for why 'the servers' have performance problems and need to be restarted so often: they're too busy.
---
Again, the fact that you've never seen uptime over a few days or hours and that's become your best insult makes it really obvious how narrow your experience is.  When I was younger my work friends and I had competitions to see who could post the longest uptime and unseat the last winner.  Not sure why you won't just admit you don't really know much about this stuff, specifically not game or media servers.
---
LOL are you serious with that post?  What happened to your perfect experience since beta?  What's all this about updates and two weeks of crashes?  Out of 51 comments, 20 of them are you so around 30 people actually replied and presumably agree with you...out of 171k.
---
[Here, I can do it too](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amaikb/from_a_very_casual_player_and_his_son_wtf_bethesda/).  I guess the difference is I didn't have to make that post myself and I didn't have to make almost half the comments and there are hundreds of threads just like it.
---
That's the point of my question. I don't think that console players can create a new account because the banned Bethesda account is linked to their console account and may be impossible to unlink since they cannot login to it. The only recourse may be to abandon their PlayStation or xbox account and all games associated with them, which I doubt people will do for Bethesda games.
---
All the positive effects go negative. Marsupial Tiny jump rope jumps, and speed demon slows to a slow crawl.
---
bravo to all of you lol!
---
You should organize all the haters and go to E3 and start a 'Fallout 76 sucks' chant. 
---
Random persistent danger status isn't new, also in my experience with it its just a hud display issue. Molerats as well, they've been that persistent since 4,the problem isnt actually sneak but their digging mechanic and back then you could mod the ability out and shake them like anything else. 
---
Wwhat about all the bugs in your game that cause loot to bug out? Its happened to every single person i know who has the game. You either find a better system that "oh they have a lot so ban them" or fix your god damned bugs. What happens to someone who just finds a bugged loot cache and ends up with 1000 stimpaks? Thats bethesda's fault and now theyre going to get fucked for it?
---
that's ok. 
---
A couple of days ago one of the guys came in and complained about being banned for crafting a few guns.
---
A couple of comments down from him he stated that he has never duped... 
---
... except for the one time he duped.
---
Wait are you telling me EVERYONE is (Spoiler) dead?!?
---
😬😬 my 5 yr old enjoyed GTA5 and Red dead. I had to stop her playing Red dead as she loves horse, but shot a dog to just drop it over a cliff.
---
I just want to be able to sell all the excess ammo I've collected as a melee to vendors.
---
That sounds depressing
---
Super mutant: \*Exists\*
---
Me: \*Shoots super mutant with 50 cal\*
---
\*Dies after 2 or 3 clips\*
---
Super mutant overlord: \*Exists\*
---
\*Hits with boxing gloves\*
---
\*Dies in 5 hits\*
---
Me: What type of fucking logic.
---
I was thinking how nice it would be for 2 or 3 loadouts you could save 2 honestly is probably all that's needed honestly. A craft/pick or hack and a weapon loadout
---
They still haven't patched the repairing bug.
---
I mean , are you sure you’ve loaded it , the markers in this game are extremely hard to follow especially when in buildings as they always point you to another objective , maybe try marking all other quests as inactive apart from the enclave one.
---
Bethesda thank you for keeping the fallout franchise Alive and thank you for continuing your hard work on this really great game.
---
I'm in agreement with you here, for the vast majority. I won't make blanket statements because I can't see what the future holds.
---
What I can say is that Bethesda has shown a clear pattern of intent in how it's developed, marketed, and pushed for ways to include a platform to monetize content for their games. They have been insistently taking every opportunity to try to find additional revenue streams from the games they make even as those games suffer a serious decline in quality and depth. 
---
At this point, I have to assume that the trend will continue. Games will get shallow and more bland and generic, in-game stores will continue to be pushed more and more agressively, and quality will go down or at best hover around the levels we've seen recently.
---
That's simply not good enough.  I'd like nothing more than to see Bethesda going back to the quality levels that built their reputation in the first place, and there are some things that I know **won't** help bring that back:
---
     Blind support. It's fine to like Bethesda games, it's fine to want them to succeed.  But to continue to shower them with money and praise in response to badly flawed products and practices that show a shocking disrespect to their customers is only going to continue the current decline. 
---
I can no longer be a part of helping Bethesda ruin some of my favorite game franchises, and I won't be giving them a single cent until they convince me that they've *earned it.*
---
Half the cards in the game are only useful if you swap them in right as you're about to do the thing they support and then immediately remove them again. This has been a pretty big design fail from the start IMO. Like all the various food perks that help you avoid disease, take less radiation and gain more nourishment, there is no reason to ever use those unless you're about to eat something, and then you can immediately ditch them again. Nobody wants to do that so nobody uses them.
---
It really is sad. You really can see a good game by looking at their communities. Look at Dark Souls 1 for example there is a large community of people that still play it. It's the same with Minecraft and Skyrim. When you give people what they want they hold on to it. Shit I still play Skyrim and Oblivion all the way through every other year.  I just dont understand with Bethesda is seeking to please everyone instead of embracing the weirdness of Fallout that made it so good. Like really Big Mountan is still my favorite DLC because its batshit crazy. 
---
Standing near the price signs is working for me
---
Kill the deathclaw.
---
Honestly if you manage perks right you dont need grenades to kill charred ghouls. Just make sure you are upgrading and modding guns and using perk cards that affect those guns. Other than an excuse for lazy complaining, nothing about the new changes actually makes the game more difficult unless you had tse weapons.
---
I agree but personally i carry almost jo damage boosters. I have lvl 5 demo but after the nerf i want to use something else and ive been vendoring or gicing away my stockpole of pumpkin grenades, nuka grenades, orbital strikes, etc. Just isnt worth it if a mirv grenade blows up, hits 6 things, ans none of them die/cripple. It just pisses them off and i get swarmed. I have maxed armor/gunsmith/melee and just swap as needed, ez pz. I run a full 6 of hacker and lockpick. I have fun, i dont feel as overpowered without the tse shotgun hitting for 700 but that was a little ridiculous. Now i have a challenge and i love it.
---
LoL I am just starting on RDR2 but thanks for the childish response. 
---
Cries in 32:9.
---
Fat finger typos on mobile :)
---
Well said. 
---
+1 nice root cause analysis, I see you follow process improvement at your place of work
---
No you should have posted, it’s f***ing annoying.
---
I was 12 when I first completed fallout 3, bloody mess was my favorite perk
---
Ah the "old engine" argument again. You are so smart. Thanks for mentioning it. No one else heard about the engine or that ignorant comment before.
---
True. DS1-3 have amazing communities. 
---
/signed QOL buff
---
Hindsight is 20/20.  People were dropping that loot into lakes and fissures back when Bethesda was telling us they didn't have any means or tools to stop dupers from duping forever.
---
Can you post the stat display for your effects after you cure RadAway?
---
Some effects don’t have numerical effects that display, however, for the effects that display I’d like to calculate the effects. 
---
Several studios offer live dev feeds and sometimes AMAs concerning their more popular or player driven titles.
---
Great now I have to make my character bald to look like Saitama now
---
Cant disagree here.   
---
Not to mention Nocturnal legendaries that are utterly awful and useless. Even  at night they barely have better stats than a normal item.
---
I'm at 15 AGI (20 with buffs).. maxed out stealth perks. (No cham armor or mutation)
---
The only thing I've noticed after the patch is that it takes much longer to go from caution to hidden. And there are times when I'm in caution as soon as I land in an area with active mobs, and getting into hidden feels almost impossible. 
---
But some of the points in the other posts are just misunderstanding of how the mechanics of sneak works I think. For example.. you can't sprint and stay hidden... you must be patient and pay attention to mobs reactions after a kill to know whether to keep shooting or re-position. You must break line of sight to get hidden status again.
---
I don't have much issue with scorchbeasts at all either before or after the patch. I can easily stay hidden and walk or even sit right under them and my status stays [  hidden. ] yes, tight bracket hidden, but hidden all the same?
---
Is it different? Yes it is. Do I think it's broken? Hmmm. Maybe not... aside from landing in caution status from a fs. 
---
This is like the 100th time someone's posted this out of laziness
---
Yes ever since the last update I’ve been getting the infinite load bug every 30 - 40 minutes prior to this update about 60 hours of game play I only ever got it once now it’s much worse I’m not sure what happened I hope they figure it soon 
---
You can get both plans and the mod. Check harpers ferry if not there watoga shopping or train station
---
Understandable. I put way too much time i I Fallout 3 and 4 to ever go back and play them again.
---
Yeah I’m aware, I meant another account.
---
My crosshair is inverted when using ultrawide (i had to go back to 16:9). It hets larger the more accurate and smaller (ex shrinks when walking) and is about as wide and useless ad my screen.
---
I have a 32:9 monitor so even 21:9 sucks to use but having 1/2 my screen black because a “AAA” dev refuses to support other standards sucks when most f2p games I play work fine with 32:2.
---
TLDR 21:9 continues to be fucked
---
Well OP melee is already a thing so go for it :p
---
Is it like, a sentient world object that happens to intersect with your camp?
---
It doesnt make logical sense, but its a gameplay mechanic. The game isnt a physics simulation used to predict rocket launches. Its a game for entertainment and cost benefit of mods has to be balanced. Just be glad the mod itself doesnt weigh 9lbs while you are carrying it unattached.
---
I'm really bored of these topics. Welcome to the same power level as everyone who didn't have a TSE. There are a lot of us who were still using non-trueshot, non-explosive legendary weapons. Only thing that's changed for us is our grenades are weaker.
---
Do you have two hunting rifles favorited? I have seen if you have multiple types equipped it removes them
---
Still worth it
---
Maybe, hope so!
---
Defo a C for trying, 
---
Haven't purchased a Ubisoft game new since Division though so will be waiting for Div 2 on pre owned myself due to all the problems. Its not an issue the game shops in the UK have pre owned games a few days after launch for most of them anyways. Hopefully Division 2 will be everything they are claiming it will be :)
---
Bethesda have dropped the ball big time on this, the only thing I can think off is they knew it was going to be this way, or maybe not as bad as they thought but an asset rip with multiplayer tacked on the side was never going to work well without proper testing at the very least :(
---
Why did you expect to be able to put 2 mods on one torso?
---
I could take 30 seconds. But this just stops and doesn’t un-stop. 
---
The whole idea is just to pay it forward. I have so many things on a daily basis I don’t need or use and just drop to be eaten by the world. There’s always someone out there that could use something.
---
Don't be disingenuous you know damn well saying me not posted my build "already makes it look shady" that's an accusatory remark. Also your grade school level grind game is hilarious.
---
Their awareness is through the roof. 
---
This is the feed back that these CM's should be taking to the devs / Todd or someone at Bethesda.
---
This is the feedback that could help them most in the future imo.
---
Nerf low health melee builds. 
---
Not at this time, but everything seemed to be the inverse of the "bonus" that rad worms gave the mutation. 
---
I wonder if hardened mass was ever being scrapped for ultracite when crafting.
---
I have been playing Fallout since 1997, and the playerbase have always been whiny dicks.
---
But now that can be monetized on YouTube, people are hurling out ridiculous amounts of vitriol for clicks.
---
Already have an instigating power fist and the damned manta man suit so I definitely am!
---
Also your lair is really dope, I think the VIP lounge is the best part. How did you get the spawn point? Moving the camp around?
---
Ill try and load it again, Thanks for replying
---
I would really like to see a benefit later in game that takes the most basic perks and turns them into skills that don't take up points.  This would be a great reward for people that completed the content and it would let them experiment with better load outs.  Having points in hacking, lock picking, home defense, and a number of other things is fine early in game because you haven't paid your dues yet.  You haven't worked within the system.  End game:. You should be able to color outside of the lines more by that point freeing up some points to play with some interesting cards.
---
Having to switch cards for what should be passive skills is tedious.
---
I dunno, I've gotten a lot of plans from level 3 locks. Sure, most of them are ice chest or something that I end up just dumping in the overseers camp, but, I got small letters once. 
---
No, only idiots would believe it. I set out to disprove it.
---
Sensitive much? Not accusatory. Sometimes the obvious needs to be pointed out to children when they can’t what’s in front of their face. 
---
If this were true, it would mean that the effects would be -50% of base. If we get some numbers I’ll add to original post. 
---
Yet another person who doesn't understand rate of fire.....posting crap to create more negativity.
---
You get a notification when you are attaching any mod to any armor that it will scrap the existing mod. 
---
I’ve had this problem with the game for a while and I don’t know if anyone else experiences this. Sometimes it feels like WAY to many enemy’s spawn I can’t tell you how many times I have been attacked by two dozen mole miners or have actually 31 feral ghouls counted all the corpses attack me at one moment I have no idea if it the intended amount that are supposed to spawn 
---
What people are reporting is that once their account is locked, there is no way to contact support. Banning someone from Fo76 permanently I can understand. Banning someone from all future single player games forever seems like throwing money away.
---
Yeah. I preordered FO76 because my love for the franchise blinded me. This was an exception. I was wrong. I may watch what D2 does. If it grows I may join late. We’ll see. The whole DarkZone thing was cool. 
---
The worst thing is that these same problems were in 4 big time, yet Bethesda completely ignored them. Nobody seriously used heavy weapons in Fo4 without mods and the like.
---
I didn't try to turn around and force you to say it's a good game, I just told you not to say the game is objectively one way for everyone
---
I did a similar test, I stocked up on supplies to make mass diluted stimpacks. With super duper active, I spam crafted the diluted stimpacks and ended up with around 1100. No ban here. 
---
Perhaps you're supposed to.
---
In FO4 All auto weapons where under the same commando perk.
---
i do see what you mean now. but I'd argue that, it would be better if they added more weapons to the game instead of shuffling them around. 
---
And lets not talk about how certain other perks are Actually useless (scrapper).
---
Also if you a buy a mod you don't need the mats. It shows up still with the list as well as Bethesda logic. But you don't need mats for mods you buy.
---
Yeah like they could have made the respawn like an hour or something. Maybe a few hours. Then we could still have fun looting them all and trying to find them all. Now what.
---
They would have literally zero reason to do so
---
NO SOUP FOR YOU!
---
I players could be ghouls that thing would be the best healing tool in history.
---
Is the the holotape "Isaac's message to the sloths" supposed to be in Big Bend tunnel? it just seems out of place, and is in two locations. I was wondering if another holotape was supposed to be there?
---
I would like to see 7 PERMA skill perk cards along the top.  You can’t remove/change them except during a level change. Add perks you always want in effect.  
---
My explosive shotgun would miss 3x in a row in VATS at close range with an 80% probability. Which is funny because outside of VATS at that range it's 100%.
---
It’s clearly the feedback that causes the most controversy as well. More the reason it should be put in front of Todd if it raises anger not only with those that agree but with those trying to stay loyal. 
---
I've never had more than like 15 ghouls attack at once. Are you a high level? I'm at 40 but maybe that makes a difference in situation rates? 
---
&gt;half a year later
---
It's been just over 76 days since the game came out.
---
Yes you do. I bought the jetpack and had to collect all the flux to attach it.
---
You gain more perks as you level, should you choose to. It’s possible to play with a higher variety of ways as you level up, give yourself perks you’ve never used before and try them out., ect 
---
That's the kind of stuff that makes you look suspicious.  That is a ridiculous amount of candy to have, bud.
---
Under normal gameplay conditions, you would not get that much candy.
---
Normal gameplay conditions meaning (no hopping, no mass farming, no mass grinding, no exploiting, etc..)
---
Bethesda is sending a very clear message that this kind of massive gathering is not going to be tolerated.
---
Honestly wish more developers would crack down on these sorts of things in online games with player economies and trading.
---
If only there was a company that had designed a game where you could do just that...
---
Is this a glitch or were they just that dumb making assaultron heads?  I was all excited to use it but one time use guns seem like they have no place in this game.  It would be better if we could just throw the head like a super grenade if it's just a single use shot anyway.
---
Yeah, the budget bit is why I suggested combined items that are pre-cluttetered for us. They could add a lived in feel without taking up extra space. 
---
Everything else, though? Yeah. More budget please. I want 5 times the current budget and double the buidable area but I'll settle for double the budget and a 25% increase in build radius. 
---
Jesus this is so stupid. It’s a video game and a helmet. No one cares. Downvote away 
---
I thought it scaled with charge, and quad asked me to scale it 4x as much. Boy was I wrong
---
I had a bug with this quest. Logging out. Logging in. Then finding the right terminal fixed it. To get the last tape bit you have to put it into the analysts terminal which is inside the sugar Grove but before you go into the main area with the loads of terminals. It's on the right then a left. In like an office with 3 or 4 terminals. Unmarked. The marker doesn't point you in the right place. But loading it into the analysts terminal in there should move the quest on. 
---
Late response, but I positioned my door so that the keypad was facing outside, and I added a keypad switch INSIDE of my house right beside the door. When I come in from outside, enter key code, when I leave from inside I simply use switch to open the door and step out, then turn around to hit the switch again to close the door. Then the only thing exposed to players outside your house is the keypad on the door, your switch is out of reach 
---
It's really easy to miss because it is just a sentence of text where it tells you what materials it needs and what it will use to make it from. It's just above that. The little warning sentence. 
---
Rule number 1, users always lie.
---
My vote goes for the drifter outfit and sniper hat combo.
---
Plus get a little bit of facial hair on your dude.. Bam. Now thats a good look.
---
I killed him a while ago. I moved, scrapped and moved my camp after.
---
Karma is a pretty good indicator. Just look through their post history too to make sure they're on the up-and-up. 
---
I've never had any issue. 
---
Also, read the sidebar there. There are middlemen and stuff. 
---
I also don't find this to be the case at all. If a mob sees me, I back up (full on retreat if I have to) and re- position to regain caution, then hidden status and start over. 
---
Mobs only ever discover my exact location if I'm being impatient and sloppy. Almost every shot I take is calculated and 2.5 sneak multiplied.  That's what snipers do. :)
---
I must have missed it. Because I attached a headlamp and some other helmet mod I didn't think twice about it
---
Right now there’s a daily cap of 1400 caps - Responder, Whitespring, Enclave, Raider, Free States, Brotherhood of Steel, Special (Watoga, Grahm, etc)
---
While I see where you’re going with the usability side of this, the real question is - what is the daily max caps available from vendors? Is it infinite (this would destroy the economy even more, make the current duping exploits even worse, not incentivize people to log in every day, etc)
---
Is it 1600? 2000? There’s way more than 3 extra vendors in the world. If they chose a cap that was lower than the current number of vendors in the world, the solution would be to just remove the extra vendors. That seems like more than an inconvenience than a boon to the game. 
---
This aged well. Like I said, hopefully he enjoys the ban!
---
Then you should remember these songs!
---
My stealth rifle char started with the Enclave officer outfit, then moved to civil war dress and witches hat, now I'm using silver shroud with the hat.
---
\&gt; We want to reassure the community that these reports are unequivocally false
---
Yeah....because you guys have been SO trustworthy during this entire experience. 
---
I noticed that when you use vats it automatically targets the head. Am I seeing that correctly? I've tried concentrated fire and it targets the torso by default. When I try to select the head (on PC) with the mousewheel, most of the time it cycles past the head to an arm no matter how gently I roll the mousewheel.
---
Trust me it's reeeally easy to miss. Lol. I have three bright helmets for xo1 if that was one u were wanting. Next time you add something you'll prob see it. But it's so easy just to click make and just think the screen is only telling you what it's gunna make it from. 
---
I feel like I constantly have to come here to find out if something I'm experiencing is bugged...sure enough the bulked item scrapping is bugged... 
---
Okay bye. Don't let the door hit you on the way out
---
Thanks for the tip. I have the helmet I want, but now need to grind again for the jetpack
---
My 11, almost 12 year old son is enjoying it.  Go eat a lemon, Mr Sourpuss.
---
Your best response to a comment describing how exploding weapons being nerfed completely making an entire aspect of the game not fun anymore is ridiculous.
---
I threw three plasma grenades at a sleeping Yao Guai last night. It still had over half its health.  I killed it with a few headshots from a hand made rifle.  3 grenades does as much damage as 3 or four headshots from a rifle.  That's just stupid.
---
Just wait till you get the "Wooden right leg +5 Vs Termites"!
---
That one's a keeper.
---
Bethesda is known for bugs.  Before bethesda, Fallout had no such reputation.
---
&gt;A probably much better solution is to not include the object modifications in the list of items that you look for components. It is done for weapons and armors, so I do not know why it is not done for the mods. 
---
Oh god. Can you imagine the shitshow if they "fixed" the existing issue and in the process introduced a new bug that makes it so weapons and armor *do* get autoscrapped when crafting/building.
---
Yes, like the OP, i fully expect to be able to do so, like jetpack and the stealthboy mod, there is no logic at all to why this should not  work, and like the OP said, we should at least get a warning....
---
I learned this the hard way myself, had the jetpack, installed stealthboy, and the jetpack was lost... (50lv's back)
---
Tried looking for this Sniper Hat but it doesn't show up on Google?
---
Ranks in animal friend or wasteland whisperer allow you to tame random spawns. Just aim at them; then alongside pacify you will have the option to tame. The beast will walk to your camp and hang out there. A level 20 deathclaw took up 10% of my budget. The damn thing kept attacking my teammates despite not being able to damage them. Too buggy to be worth it.
---
Additionally mods in f4 and the others used to go into your inventory if I'm not mistaken. This is the only game I've seen where it deletes it completely. Or atleast it used to go in ur inventory for guns and armor. It was a big change for me to get used to. No more just taking a silencer off a weapon and adding it to the one I wanted to keep. Now you have to learn everything. 
---
I played the division from day one..it was a buggy mess. The weekly state of the game streams were something I always looked forward to. It let people know they cared. And they listened. And they did fix the game. In the end the division turned into a great game. I've already pre-ordered the second one. Bethesda should do the same thing with weekly live streams
---
This isn't really solved if we can't play in fullscreen mode. I tried playing in window mode and my fps dropped by like 50, so I'm not playing in that laggy mess of a mode.
---
Bethesda needs to fix this.
---
This is true, they are completely banned from Bethesda which means they can't access any of their single player games or anything if they bought them through the site.
---
Didn't need them for mine, it may show that you lack the materials but if you click it it still equips it.
---
Its just the Scarlet sniper hat you get from the atom shop. :p
---
Is there a way to expand your camp budget or something? I don't have a quarter of what you have and am maxed out. Nothing is "stored". 
---
Let us “favorite” them so they end up in our wheel too.   I don’t know about everyone else but I don’t fill the whole wheel up.
---
Please continue posting this everywhere. 
---
Power armor. 400 damage one shots. 1600 damage one shots. Whats the point of building unyielding other than epeen. But if epeen, go unyielding. I find the 50% reduction from emergency protocals in PA way better than a bigger number on my pip boy.
---
WHO HAS THE ANSWERS!?!?!
---
You’re not supposed to be swapping them around every time you see a computer or safe.
---
You’re supposed to spec into something and stick with it.
---
The ability to swap cards on the fly is a convenient alternative to re-speccing completely.
---
If this were fallout 4 and you perked into pistols, then took those points and put them into lock picking every time you saw a safe, that would be stupid.
---
Instead of everyone bitching about this system, you should  in fact be grateful that you can change it around at all.
---
What console are you on. Or system. I'll keep an eye out if it's xbox and just flip it to you for the price of the mod. I generally check enclave every time I log on or hop. Haha just hoping for another calibrated shock. 
---
It's to bring it in line with energy weapons,  obviously. 
---
this is actually wrong, if they haven't changed anything lately, it shows you that you are missing some mat's, but you can still attach it, at least that is how it used to be,,,
---
It did not work for me. Perhaps another glitch/inconsistency in the game
---
The new changes ruin fun ways of playing the game that had nothing to do with TSE's.  Your point is to just suck it up and get good.  Screw that elitist garbage.  People are allowed to be annoyed when entire classes of weapons are ruined because of one particular overpowered combo.  
---
Agreed. It’s tough when they’ve invested what they have into this game and it’s dying this fast. But I just don’t think they realize how significant a lack of communication contributes to it. I’m sure there are plans to improve things and maybe (doubtfully) I’ll be back in six months since I’ve already purchased the game. But it’s not likely. Especially without knowing what’s going on. 
---
I had one bad exp with a level 220ish destroying my camp but have been rescued multiple times by high levels when I was in over my head. I am only level 66 but occasionally I run into a new player and they team invite me and I play body guard / healer for awhile.  The good far outweigh the bad in my experience. I usually just play solo or with my kids. I guess that’s the mom in me wanting to protect the noobs. Ha ha They like to joke I’m still a mom in game since I am always cooking soup for them but I’m more than twice their level and they are killing me in stimpacks! 
---
I've come across them in that spot also.
---
They’re broken currently and have been since the beta. It’s supposed to be like a laser musket with no max charge limit but instead it just fires every cell you have. 
---
ok.thnx for the tip.
---
Well if it was reported in the beta it should be fixed before they release the actual game at least.  When is that anyway?
---
Can show loyalty by pre ordering there games, not by trying to defend a game against other peoples opinions. They wont thank anyone for it, it doesn't help anything at the route of the issues.
---
If anything all that does is come off as dismissive and inflates the ego of the company to the point where they accept mediocrity.
---
If someone says i'm mad because of this this this and this, no amount of trying to counter that with stupid arguments or blind fanboism is going to change that.
---
Giving genuine feedback i.e. letting companies know something is wrong will or should eventually end up with the issues being looked at and fixed.
---
I agree with you
---
Crap items this bad just shouldn't exist. I'm sorry for you, OP :/
---
Added technical data to the compartment last night with no issues 
---
Wow dude, calm down. This is also a video game. A source of entertainment. Besides, if you want to compare realism, try shooting a mini nuke at one. Hardly even scratches it, even though a real world counterpart would basically vaporize it. Also, you have no idea if I'm a millenial or not lol.
---
Lol. I would but I don't know the market for shit. I lost my 1 star bloodied gatling gun to a bug so I'd like to replace that, but mostly I enjoy being self found. When bethesda implements trading into the game (if they ever follow up on that promise) then I might sell it, but I've tried a little bit of market place shenanigans and I'm mostly not interested in slogging through that subreddit.
---
Well the thing is people have been wondering whether Bethesda actually knows what they're doing for years now. I am actually surprised to a degree that people are still willing to put in the time to mod Bethesda's games espacially after the whole creation club/paid mod scam they tried to pull on the modders. If i were a modder i would've just left Bethesda entirely at that point. 
---
I didn't find any leg to get.  I would have been happy with some left leg.  It's lonely in the wasteland at night...
---
That's also happening to me. I'm done for the moment with the game, time to get a break since new games are aproaching and I don't want to get angrier. Back to FO4 heavily modded :)
---
They are not in my inventory
---
Dude holy shit. That’s a game changer right there’, thank you!
---
I guess I understand why people continue to write these, but what I find more confusing is the amount of support they get.  If you're done with FO76, why are you still here?   Not referring to OP, presumably won't waste time here.
---
Sure thing, let me know when you'll be on and what's your IGN?
---
I too have had times where ridiculous numbers of enemies spawn.  Three waves of super mutants is annoying.
---
Thank god, every post on r/gaming or whatever was full of people screaming about bethesda, and I just kept asking for actual proof in the comments, which no one could ever provide me.
---
If he was using 3rd party apps or writing code to sell, yeah.  But these 'exploits' are in game already.  The current devs can't even patch out the duping...5 patches in.  
---
Banning them from every Bethesda game going forward is very short sighted.  Look at steam, they shame people who have had a VAC ban.  But makes these bans have a time limit due to the severity of the cheating done. 
---
Apparently I have exploited due the camp glitch which made my base x5 and 500% over budget.  It took me 45 damn minutes just to correct it and I didnt even abuse it, the game did it for me.
---
Well than maybe he shouldn't cheat. He's a dumbass if he really didn't think he was going to get punished.
---
There’s a lot of soot flower around Flatwoods. 
---
I'm sorry this happened to you, but it's happened to me several times over now (a few times when I nuked Prime myself). My only solution so far is to kill the SBQ quickly enough that it doesn't have the opportunity escape in the first place. 
---
The mod for this works great. Let Bethesda get involved and no doubt they will just screw it up.
---
I'm on PC. Thanks for the tip/help! If I see a calibrated shock I'll let you know
---
Not here. Another note a .50 caliber desert eagle tears the shit outta a watermelon
---
Reminds me of 4's Far Harbor there's a Mirelurk Queen with some Hunters east of DiMA's Cache, out of bounds. Cool find as a single player game, not so much online.
---
Having the same problem with multiple Gatling guns - was fine before patch 5.
---
I got a 90% reduced weight auto-grenade launcher the other day. I decided to keep it, but all of the others I got in game including a number of three star ones were all way to heavy to carry around. The ammo is also too heavy. IMHO it is currently not a viable option. It would be nice to be a part of heavy guns, and subject to Bear Arms. A ammo weight reduction would make it more useful. Until then, I will keep the one I have, but it really will sit in my stash until I decide to sell or dump it. If they make some of those changes in an upcoming release I would use it. In two-months with no movement... its dumped.
---
I get *super* marsupial when rad worms hits.
---
For some reason, I also lose marsupial entirely from time to time (no rad-x used). Relogging seems to fix it.
---
That's not what I said at all. You are bringing baggage here. Its not elitist at all to point out that the game is largely unchanged if you don't rely on explosives for everything. Its so much easier to use guns, and ammo for guns is so much more common that its asinine to rely heavily enough on explosives that the game is ruined by this change. The weight of explosive ammo makes its use as a primary unreasonable, and you can drop much more damage on a ghoul with a gun in the time it takes to throw a grenade and have it explode. Esp since ghouls are harder to hit with grenades due to the way they move. Its an unrealistic scenario to begin with.
---
Can’t nuke Flatwoods tho
---
That mod is awesome. I have a adventure set, a team set, a melee set, a queen fight set and a craft set. All quick to switch between. It is fantastic!
---
I agree.  It is nice that power armor gives you 11 str early game.  After you have 11 str, it should give you a plus 3 to strength and a total of plus 50 carry weight.  The excavator armor with its plus 100 before mods is nice and should be a step up from that.
---
Hey man what is the Tech Data for? I have a bunch of them, nothing to do with them though. 
---
yup, whats the point of buying the mod if you still need the mats to make it....
---
Its either broken or ... something
---
Yeah my tool tips for my guns change all the time for my weapons without changing perks. I'll log in one day my guns has say 150dmg for this purpose an next log in it will have 160 without changing anything or any buffs to dmg from effects. Their coding is just super flawed.
---
Drop item into water and open a support ticket for the plan.
---
how much for the vampire shotgun?
---
sometimes they did. but they stopped respawning after a while for some reason.
---
Ran into one last night just East of Welch Station, eating a bunch of Scortched for lunch...
---
Cheers bro but I'm xbox. Pick it up for urself tho if u see it. The +50 carry weight per mod is epic
---
Wow, agreed. I have to make the trip from Watoga to White Springs to look. I have only seen Nuka Cola, Cherry, and Quantum.
---
Also tackles out knowing which size is a certain armor piece. 2 birds with one stone.
---
i want to start fallout 76 with an experienced and popular discord group
---
I can’t trust this, with everything wrong that you guys have done. Im not a victim of banning, but you guys have been trying to pull the wool over our eyes since day 1. Intentionally avoiding topics until you couldn’t anymore, not giving complete information when we ask for it, and you guys saying you will give it. 
---
I don’t think you realize how much you hurt TRUE fans of this game. Im afraid that you are just telling us what we want to hear. 
---
**Sissy:** Help! 
---
**Protectron:** Stay calm, citizen. Watoga Emergency Services is here to assist you. 
---
**Sissy:** Mr. Sparkles is in the tree.
---
**Protectron:** Citizen, clarify. What is a "Mr. Sparkles?" 
---
**Sissy:** A cat. And he's in that tree!
---
**Protectron:** A *cat* is in the tree. 
---
**Sissy:** Yeah! He shouldn't be in there! 
---
**Protectron:** The *cat* should not be in the *tree*. Is this correct, Citizen? 
---
**Sissy:** Yes! Hurry! 
---
**Protectron:** Citizen, please stand back. 
---
*&lt;Sound of laster blasts&gt;* 
---
**Sissy:** No!!! 
---
**Protectron:** Situation under control. Cat is no longer in tree. 
---
**Sissy:** Mr. Sparkles...
---
Why not make the looting of the corpse or meatpile the end of the event (maybe add 10 min to the timer after the battle for times when the server takes longer to load the loot) or a misc quest that activates after the end of the battle that way the Queen keeps her quest marker. 
---
Honestly, I have to choose between picking locks and rifleman perks. I just don't pick locks any more.
---
No benefit - just do 1 at a time 
---
In my opinion, dupe hunters are just as guilty. It litterally does nothing but reset one round of duping and it's just an excuse for them to get duped loot and act self righteous about it. If you picked up duped loot and kept it, you partipcated in duping. Final answer.
---
Didn't realize you could ferry a level 12 into a nuke silo... This is a legit issue so why frame it in a lie
---
Wait if you have the lvl 3 lockpicking perk you cant unlock a lvl 1 lock without swapping cards?
---
They really need to change the way hacking and lock picking perks function. It’s just poor design, completely tedious, and a totally unnecessary restriction. If I would rather skip the locked terminal/door/container than swap cards to open it, it needs to be changed. u/LoneVaultWanderer u/LadyVann can either of you get some traction on this? Suggestions to go along with the complaining:  
---
1) Make them entirely passive so there’s no need to equip them.  
---
2) Make them zero point cost cards so they can stay equipped permanently.  
---
3) Make then passive and/or zero point cards that require 3/6/9 PER/INT for Lockpicking/Hacking and make the items in locked containers/hacked doors more rewarding.  
---
I’d prefer the last option to make the perks more engaging and rewarding. It seems that making them passive wouldn’t be that difficult either because we can use the Lock feature on purifiers, doors, and terminals in our CAMPs without having the cards equipped.
---
This is what I‘m talking about. Thank the pvp whiners for that. Some kid screamed „unfair“ and then Bethesda nerfed the endgame weapon tier. This was the reason why many people stopped playing (myself included).
---
There are no ranged weapons worth aquiring anymore.
---
The whole game part aside, as someone with experiance in some toxic relationships, managing to have and end two relationships during the, so far, short life of this game is not a good sign. Take some time to learn to love yourself as well. You'll be in a better place for it in the long run.
---
lets throw all of the banned players into their own server 
---
That shouldn't be a perk.  That should just be how melee works.
---
It's dangerous to go alone. It's dangerous to go in groups. It's just dangerous out there.

My lvl 35 ski sword had more dmg then my automatic primed lvl 45 handmade.
---
It automatically targets whatever limb you last targeted.
---
bruh I'm joking..seriously
---
250?
---
Thanks man
---
No, you’re not. Or they’d make all perk cards permanent. That’s the whole point of the system. That being said, when it comes to hacking and lock picking, the design philosophy does not function well at all.
---
It's on Bethesda's Known Issues post.
---
I suspect the underlying reason is that most of the BoS outfits (but not the BoS Bomber Jacket) switch which frame model you're actually using, and they forgot to had the +60 resistances from the frame to the BoS version.
---
Apparently amount of budget goes up with level, although Bethesda’s lack of any concrete numbers to that effect are frustrating. But I definitely have way more at 92 than I did at 30. Also contractor perk is a must have. Max it out. But anything you built before you maxed it is still going to take more budget, so you gotta max it out, then scrap and rebuild EVERYTHING. It’s a pain but opens up way more space. 
---
Wrong sub? 
---
This is amazing. Then Lucien Lachance shows up and murders your every time you log into the game. 
---
You'll find out once you do the BoS questline. 
---
Dupe hunters? You mean the trolls that harass people in the name of white knighting?
---
We should let the professionals handle it. Then no one has to worry about accidentally being banned.
---
Ight thanks man, love that u didnt spoil anyting
---
I haven't even seen the "Contractor" card yet at level 61....
---
When you notice your and your son's levels (69 and 12), it's really hard to not think about it as your actual age.
---
No some of us want the game to work correctly an not be relying on bugs.
---
Lol have you forgotten the buggy shitmess morrowind was? That was the reason I played Bethesda games because the bugs are funny as shit, I already unsubbed so don't mind me, I'm playing the game.
---
I'd love more insights like this. Great job!
---
That's theft, mail boxes work like what I described. What you are saying is a federal crime.
---
Um I wrote that I scraped everything I thought grey bar was that to used to be anyway.... I still have bar even when storag is empty. I'll take. Pic when I'm off work
---
Fortnite ?
---
Yeah, Bethesda made sure to nerf the fun of the game and ignored all of the communities concerns. So is it really that irritating that the players chose to quit ?
---
I won’t stay much longer. To your point. I’ve hung around but once this thread dies I’ll probably be off. The community here has been pretty decent IMHO. Much like a lot of the communities there are always a few bad apples. 
---
Regarding support, it’s mixed as you can see by the votes. This is predictable. 
---
The other subs have no where as close to the amount subscribed here so I hit both 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
The math is the same no matter what order you do it in btw. 1.3*1.5 = 1.5*1.3
---
Fair enough.
---
You unlock it for sure by 61. Check under intelligence next time picking perk cards when you level. 
---
Yh they had to do a "hot" fix and close the game for a few hours to fix it... Again... Not at all amateur...
---
yea dude just saw this lol but yea totally
---
I swear I sometimes see a slider when rapidly making soup.
---
Thx bruh
---
It'd be a nice feature to have, and it's so simple I don't think even Bethesda could screw it up. But then again they launched without push-to-talk so anything is possible.
---
Who would have thought, people making stuff up and other believing it like idiots.
---
It functions great. When you’re playing The game like it’s supposed to be played. 
---
:)
---
Dupe has never left. There is supposedly a lot of way to still do it. Never done it so don't ask.
---
In the hands of a scorched, that WOULD be a Super Sledge!
---
That is what we were saying before the patch the whole time. There is no replacement for the TSEs. And thus nothing. to strive for 
---
3 characters later. I'm tired of getting used to bethesda's updates and nerfs. Guess I enjoyed the game while it was good (or broken), and too used to the positive effects I associated with hundreds of hours of grinding. Keep it Bethesda, I'm tired of being pro 76, u taught me if nothing that it's time per a new game I give up.
---
Does a game NEEDS to be a physics simple you make 20 +3 = 23 not 29?
---
I’m bored of the people who weren’t nerfed.
---
Whatever dude have a good day
---
I'm currently running a bathrobe and captains hat, so that's a look
---
If you're on xbox, I want it!!!!
---
That has always been a problem. I think it might have something to do with how many people are in the area, and also how many bodies around around. I don't know though.
---
I'm level 139 and seen 1 once in a nuked fissure prime
---
I forget to change them out a lot its a pain.  I understand the concept but the application of it needs work.
---
Yup i was guessing that was the problem 
---
The plans are held by vendor bot Greg at Grafton. 
---
Contractor only reduces material cost for workshop items. Not sure what OP means by having to scrap and rebuild everything.
---
If you have proof open a ticket. They wrote me back in 2 days when I reported dupers that trolled me. They are looking.
---
"Officer, I just found this briefcase of cocaine lying on the jersey shore and I thought it best to bring it back to my hotel room so that no children could stumble across it and accidentally write a meandering screenplay."
---
I've already told on another post. I think it's a mix between Bethesda's nerf and bug. They are trying really hard all people using a PA melee build and just PVP, while I only hunted 3 or 4 griefers in +250 hours. People usually are colaborative, want to help and trade, not to oneshot you with a baseball bat. I think Bethesda wants to enter in other markets (Fornite, CoD)and just forgetting his own. It's sad
---
I respectfully and completely disagree. Playing the game “the way it’s supposed to be played” goes completely against Bethesda’s core design philosophy (without going into the bounds of abuse/exploiting/cheating). I like the card card system but it does not mesh well with Lock Picking and Hacking at all.
---
Oh they can fix some things then ? Far Cry where are you .....
---
nope. You are not. The TSE were nerfed to the ground and now there is nothing left. 
---
All the time as opposed to people that specialize in bloodied that have thei health at that point all the time?
---
Or make it cost 0 points. I feel like some of the crafting cards need to be 0 point passives as well, gets kind of silly swapping so many cards in just before crafting (such as Ammosmith, Super Duper, and some others).
---
Which flux are u looking for? I get spot flowers around vault 76..u might be able to nuke north of there 
---
Someone found a fix for this. I will try an find where I found it. Give me a bit.
---
You done gone and jinxed it now :/
---
Watch them implement a decline all invitations option, that some how turns it into single player now ; )
---
PC 
---
Rema5tered
---
C.A.M.P. 40% of C.A.M.P budget is taken up by phantom deceased tamed animals. Need budget back, C.A.M.P building is my primary activity :(
---
This has some really good suggestions. I know what they were getting at by making us switch in and out (The idea wasn't to let us just switch when we needed it but try to make us choose what we wanted our character to do but allow some flexibility). Your suggestions still allow that while either making it more important to make the choice rather than just use tediousness to get around the mechanic or make it easy to switch in and out of different profiles.
---
Possibly lol
---
Yeah getting a good spawn there is really tough regardless due to fact you spawn in differently than guests(I had a steel shelve blocking guests by accident when I moved it one time). Since fast travel is required, I kept looking for a good spot. The one I have now lets me chose to run into my base or outside before the solid Rock loads, so even if I have zero caps I'm not trapped. Guests also spawn in without issue inside VIP which is also annoying I wish everything spawned upstairs on the "dance floor"
---
Thats not how it works. You are either being purposefully deceitful or willfully ignorant. The game is balanced to 29lbs for the weapon so you have to make cost benefit decisions about the weight of the weapon vs the usefulness of the mod. If you had things your way, where they all added up correctly, they wouldn't change the weapon to 23, they would change the mod to 9, because its balance for the weapon. Making the mods lighter when not attached is just nice because it doesn't suck up inventory weight for something that is effectively useless when unattached.
---
Sounds like my little brother... Got a 1 year ban from Playstation Plus or whatever it's called for dropping the N-word numerous times and making threats against people... I still have no idea how he grew up so damn racist living in the same house and having the same upbringing...
---
But he's a loud mouth about everything, and everything is always everyone else's fault... drives be insane...
---
Wait, Halloween Candy is rare? When I went into the school every damn thing dropped dozens of them. I came out with a couple thousand. 
---
I never really cared, because the candy wasn't exactly a useful item, but I don't see how collecting 500k in a 30 day period is difficult. 
---
Unless there was a nerf I missed. Truth is I only ever went in the one time. 
---
Yep got the same problem with the crosshair. That wasn't like that prior to patch 5
---
Agreed, some way to block them altogether. Be careful accepting team invites from randoms. A lot of the time they will just see where your camp is once you accept and then go destroy it. Either that or just using you to fast travel across the map. 
---
Omar a goddamn hero
---
its a shame you didn't just use the search bar to find the answer :( Yeah, people got their games. are you on console?
---
Any day now
---
It’s only for pc. DL the Bethesda launcher and it should display the games for download.
---
He could make another PlayStation Network account, name it different from the other one, buy a disk version of the game. There's always some way around a ban, it just takes time and money.
---
If it weren't for the perk load out manager mod I'd never pick locks 
---
One of the previous patches added ultrawide support and fov adjustment. Was playing fine with just that without any mods for ultrawide. Now it seems broken again.
---
Sound like using a 3rd party program or mod is bannable which is that way in a lot of games so yea.
---
Comment number 1000 of someone complaining about a complaint post.
---
Pick a different sub. We are all sick of you.
---
I'd be okay with that.
---
Wish I could help you out. When the game launched I think most people found windowed to cause unplayable frame drops. Now its the only mode I can use on the ultrawide monitor. Maybe try uninstalling/reinstall? Or make a new post asking for ini and resolution experts to assist. 
---
All he has to do is make a new account to play fiture Bethesda games
---
I have the same problem with a sniping rifle. It’s since the hotfix this week. 
---
Yeah I'm on console but Bethesda specifically said that everyone was getting codes. I didn't use the search bar because I tried Google and it didn't tell me anything.
---
I get my cobalt and crimson at white springs.
---
I feel like Bender's son, and have to sacrifice my memory to know how to bend...
---
Well shit, now I know how to pick this lock, but I forgot how to hold my gun.
---
Hey, FYI, leather arms are cheaper and after you break them down you only lose one steel. You can get all unlocks for all armor pieces this way. 
---
How many caps are they selling for?
---
I have complained about it serval times already.  I don’t think we should just accept it as it is.  That’s probably why Beth has not been taking this game seriously and why the patches are so slow and makes the game worse than pre-patch.  
---
I think some aspects of the perk system was just very poorly designed.  What’s the point of making us pausing the game to switch cards so we can open some doors/containers?  The easiest fix I can think of to this issue would be just make it so that some of the perk cards would require 0 points but still retain the lvl requirement.  So once you hit that required level you can equip that card without it taking away from your SPECIAL points.  
---
If they don’t tune that to our liking I’m can live with it.  Just fix the damn bugs!!!  Please. 
---
This games an utter joke.  The fact u need bans in the first place.... gotta say I’m enjoying the show 
---
Years ago, some sadistic a-hole was like "Lets give this giant enemy crab an armor ignoring  acid spray attack."  We've been paying for it ever since.  
---
Sorry but all survivors are required to down the entire bottle of booze in one go and smash it on the ground. No exceptions. They're lucky they get to keep the caps off of nuka cola bottles.
---
But only soup
---
So we're just going to assume everyone else who's had this issue is a lier? Not saying Bethesda is lieing either, but it's not hard to imagine them letting a bug into the ban system.
---
Honestly it's a bit disheartening to see how bipolar this sub is. You're mad at them, then they say "Nah, it's all cool" and you suddenly love them again. Then there's another issue and the fangs come back out, and so on and so on. 
---
You are correct, the ones who profited were not 'tinkering' those were indeed exploiting. I am not defending them one bit. 
---
Whats the point of having cards at all. If we can swap them out at any time, why have to swap them out at all? just give some cards a SPECIAL requirement and call it a day.
---
There’s a decent amount of cobalt, yellowcake, fluorescent, and crimson at white spring. Morgantown has quite a bit of cobalt and some violet. The cranberry bog has a lot of crimson and violet.
---
Absolutely fucking spot on. Blind faith either way just keeps this bullshit going. Bethesda should have nearly zero credibility at this point. On the other hand, these people who are being "wrongfully banned" absolutely should not be believed at face value either. 
---
     People need to start showing proof. If you intend to mass craft, just hit the damn record button. Cover your ass. It will solve 90% of this shit. If you get banned, submit your videos. Done deal. But I have literally no idea how Beth can come back from all of this. I'm honestly just disappointed, frustrated and sad. I really wanted this game to be what it could have been, but as things stand, it's nearly irreparable.

     I'm uninstalling it today. Haven't played in around 2 weeks now. With the bugs they've introduced, the nerfs, and the in-game player environment at its most toxic, it's just not something I want to play anymore. I'm around level 150, and I hoard and mass craft consistently. I use a few two shots, tse, all found legitimately. The way I play the game seems to be a recipe for disaster. I don't want to take the risk of losing my account, when I still play FO4 consistently as well as the majority of their other games. 
---
     I've been loyal to this company for years, since the days of Morrowind. And I feel betrayed. Bought the game day of release, full price. And had to watch them sell the game weeks later for a third of the price. Disappointed, frustrated and sad. I truly, with all my heart, hope that they can address all these issues with the game. That they can show us all that they can still do better than this. That they're still the company that made some of the most beautiful, open and fun games we've ever played.
---
     Until then, I'm just going watch, wait and pay close attention to all sides of this shit-show. Black Desert is being fully released March 1st, and that's as close to a BGS game as I've seen in a long while. An unbelievably gorgeous, open and fun mmorpg. The Outer Worlds could be coming soon. Cyberpunk 2077 is on the way. There's so many good rpg's coming. They may not be Fallout, or Elder Scrolls, but until God Howard can really start cracking that whip, and fix this fucking circus, I'm out. It was fun for a while, but as is it just isn't worth it for me. I hope everyone else can get some enjoyment out of it. Here's hoping... 
---
Fair enough.  Your time, your life.  
---
Yeah. Found them in the wild plenty
---
My combat rifle keeps getting removed due to my sniper changing to its spot! One of them little random annoyances isn’t it haha.
---
Tons of plants near mama dolce. But I tried the fissure site and they are spread out there.
---
I got a 3*** rolling pin last night. Vendor bot Wallace wanted to give me 1 cap for it. Must’ve been a GameStop employee in his past life. Think I’ll hold onto it for now
---
PC users can do this, but I think that Playstation users (not sure about Xbox) have their Playstation accounts linked to Bethesda.net, and these can only be unlinked by logging into Bethesda.net, which can't be done when banned. I'm sure there are other games on his account that prevent abandoning the entire Playstation account.
---
**300 caps each**
---
Adrenal Reaction, Bird Bones, Chameleon, Eagle Eyes, Egg Head, Electrically Charged, Empath, Healing Factor, Herd Mentality, Marsupial, Plague Walker, Speed Demon, Twisted Muscles
---
 I don't see anyone doing that. Most everyone realizes the game has some serious issues. Some folks are still trying to be positive in life.
---
I would try and find a good Gauss rifle, as they are the highest damage semiautomatic rifle that can get a silencer. After that, I’d try to use a sneak rifleman build, as those are pretty effective at the moment.
---
Thank you. 
---
I loved the hardcore mode in New Vegas, what I do not understand is how it fit so well in that game and things did not seem like chores. Sure, occasionally you would have to improvise with weapons and armor until you found a proper workbench but it wasn’t like I was spending a whole day crafting ammo. Even the thirst/hunger mechanics seemed decently balanced. It added extra challenge and planning but it was just another aspect of the whole experience rather than the centerpiece of it.
---
That's true, but I think most gamers aren't willing to dump all of their existing games to be able to play FO76.
---
I'm around level 40 now and my only goal in the game is to make sure new players have good first experiences. I always seek out levels 10-30 to drop them helpful items or lead them to my sweet base with all the crafting benches. I love the fuzzy feeling I get from players giving me a thumbs up or heart emote after I've helped them.
---
(P.s. I usually avoid under level 10 because they're still learning how the game works so I don't wanna make the beginning too easy for them)
---
To my knowledge, (and once again, that’s hazy thanks to Bethesda not sharing actual numbers on how it works), the less you spend on materials, the less budget it takes. It doesn’t make sense but I swear after scrapping everything then rebuilding it all from scratch I had way more budget room, but maybe that’s just because I was higher level? There’s some kind of voodoo going on there that I admittedly do not fully understand. 
---
Yeah last weekend was private one. Had to preorder the game for code.
---
Cobalt flux which is soot flowers
---
&gt; I play as a raider literally insane 
---
[This is a perfect description of me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_lbuyM9R9w)
---
I've got 110k 5mm (minigun is hungry) and I'll craft 10k plus at a time as fast as possible. Never had any issues. 
---
No.  Two shots should literally be double damage.  Anything else is a sign of other things being completely out of balance.  Hint: it's in the name, two shot.
---
Really...

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Fallout+76+get+classic+edition
---
Second hit
---
I have quit, uninstalled..blah blah blah.  I have got my money's worth from the game being bought at £35.  The story was meh but some quests I enjoyed.  Even bought atoms God help me.
---
If I had bought the special edition or tri edition I would be pushing for a refund.  E3 said lots of lies.  The game even now is beta at best.  I've played DayZ, rust, h1z1, 7 days etc etc.  You could put up worth bugs for the most part as you knew exactly what you were buying into it .
---
Bethesda lied about the beta and lied about the game.  It was marketed as an AAA game.  They said the atom shop would be cosmetic only, that's a another lie.    What's worse is the practices they employ to stop their games being reviewed until after release.  There is a fantastic video by totalbiscuit (rip 😪) on why this isn't a good thing for consumers.  Here is the [video](https://youtu.be/76tSYX6ZxsA) 
---
I'll still lurk this subreddit and wait for any big changes to the game.  But at the same time I think big changes need to made in the management and the engine itself.  I wonder how many devs are actually working on the engine rather than adjusting the classes and config files.  Patch 5 was proof that they just changed a few functions without even considering what those actually did.  Hence even after the hot fix, there is the bug of scrapping bulk junk.  
---
Even modders pointed this out before they played the new patch.  Yes programming is hard.  I know myself how changing something can break another.  But that's just it.  They don't go into detail what these functions actually do and what other functions are dependant on that particular one.  
---
The game engine is a mess.  They need a full rewrite or cleanup of the current one.  Without that every patch for 76 is going to introduce new bugs.  Every one.  
---
MAILBOXES ARE GAMEBREAKING!! Mr Prizebot would no longer visit me :( 
---
They probably want to use you to free travel. Thats the most common reason i get invites. Help each other out. 
---
1.2 shot
---
I got it
---
Yeah in what survival game do you stockpile 10k+ rounds for less than a day of gameplay... just lol
---
You probably got a disease or your mutations stopped working
---
Yeah see how close u can nuke to the north of vault 76..I've gotten cobalt at WS but it is not as much as fluorescent or crimson
---
Headlamps give a small nuclear symbol next to the power armor name, so thats how I've been able to tell the difference between my excavator and x-01
---
Low damage high attack rate weapons suck.
---
I did the math, against 100 armor a gatling gun needs only 47 bullets to out-damage a minigun's full 500, that is how big a difference 79 damage makes against 14, a factor of 10.6 rounds to one for a damage difference of 7.5.
---
Console players get access but it's only a PC download. Gotta download from their launcher
---
I really like how destiny has different pvp rules / buffs depending on what PvP mode you're playing.  I'm not sure how that could be implemented in fallout, but that might be cool.
---
I actually found *this* sub by reading posts about it from folks in other threads who couldn’t handle the idea that some people don’t hate the game outright like they do. I quickly realized this is the place I’d rather go for FO76 news. Just let me know when Bethesda starts sending me a paycheck, because apparently that’s a part of being here as well.
---
I always thought the trade steal glitch was bs...my version of it is...
---
Player A want to trade some legendary loot with player B for other legendary loot.
---
Player A offers his loot for 0 caps expecting player B to offer his for 0 caps and expecting a fair "trade" of items.
---
Player B clicks to take the item from player A for 0 caps and the trade window closes.
---
Player A says, "HEY! I didn't get my legendary loot!!"
---
Player B knows he got player A's item for 0 caps without offering anything in return.
---
Player B says "Sorry mate, must be a glich. Got to go."
---
Never a glitch but a person with no "street smarts" me thinks.
---
Prime has crimson too, cranberries are crimson.
---
[this link](https://twinfinite.net/2018/11/fallout-76-pure-flux-how-get/) might be helpful for planning a spot.
---
There are some scrubbers in West Tek
---
I get that, numbers I listed are flat damage with all perk damage cards on. Prior to nerf all chemed, adrenal reaction, and adrenaline stack was over 2k damage. I mean yeah the TSE guns still top tier I just think they went overboard on the nerf. Its bc of PvP. Which is bs.. Fallout has always been single player and now they force pvp on us with all these griefer dbags.
---
Its whatever tho, I've logged over 350 hours and farmed/completed everything. Dont need anymore guns, have a instigating and bloody super sledges too. Really no reason to jump on.
---
Are ruptured hallucigen gas canisters used for anything at all? I'm surprised they still haven't removed that tag from those. Also the tag still needs to be added to stingers and such (for syringer barrels).
---
Thanks Bethesda. That's good to hear. I had stopped playing; I was worried about a being banned for crafting anything. Mostly due to the awful patch and my experience as a software QA. 
---
Again looks like you haven't read the entire post. A lot of the damage was rolled into the SPECIAL stat itself. So you're shorting yourself significantly on the SPECIAL stats you don't max.
---
But hey if you want to be a bit better than average at using every weapon you go right ahead. Carry one of everything around, that's only going to weigh like 200lbs. And of course you can only actually use one at a time which means all those other perks you spent on weapon damage are doing nothing.
---
perk loadouts would be good too
---
I have this 3 star lvl 45 Marine assault armour leg
---
1. Grants the ability to breath under water
---
2. Whenever I sneak I go invisible
---
3. I don't remember what this one is
---
lmaooooo
---
No, but the fix there is to prevent damage stacking from low health. Bloodied should work like nerd rage. Temp buff on hit. That’d fix it. 
---
No not plans
---
Blueprints 
---
It’s previous constructed models kept together in a blueprint. I think it’s the second or third creation option under the CAMP menu
---
I honestly feel that there was an original intention of having perks be not swappable or some other sort of scheme that was changed well after they were designed. 
---
What can you do with the raw flux? 
---
Well you must bother to swap out these cards or you wouldn’t be able to use them 
---
I have bigger issues than this
---
Targeting HUD is the culprit for the CTDs I've had in the past couple of weeks. I don't and have never had that mod, yet I've seen the enemies highlighted in red when doing a quest with another player - not a teammate, just a rando - for a minute or two before the game dies. 
---
Oh, maybe it was arms than I was meaning to mention. I do the cheapest one.
---
Or just make it so those perk cards requires 0 points to equip. 
---
&gt; shit for 20h straigh. Please just tell m why would you.
---
Because its an automatic pickup for doing the event, and doing the event is one of the best ways to level up and get legendaries.  The candies have no weight, don't spoil and give 1% food each.  It's the only food I carry
---
Based on analysis of the game's files, looks like my guess was pretty close (rather they just added a tag and removed a tag).
---

Mutations.  Good call. Lemmie check.
---
at least
---
If you are on xbone I can give you one. I bought it for someone else and they ended up not needing it.
---
dude a girl talked to  you and to help you out!! that could have been your future wife!!... on a serious note though I like when people do nice things like that, pretty cool! :)
---
Covert it to stable flux..which is used to craft serums..power armor..etc
---
What if instead of mr prizebot going to deliver mail to victims of nuclear war...he actually came to your camp and rewarded your mail box?
---
Not a disease, but let me check mutations. 
---
Good post. Nice to see a bit of what causes things like this. 
---
No shit? Go eat a brick.
---
Xbox user so not sure how it works on PS4, but what is stopping him from creating new gamer tag.  Use his current account for playing any games he already bought, use the new account for Bethesda games.  None of my accounts are banned, but I can freely log into 3 different Bethesda accounts on my Xbox.
---
But father I love him! I dont want to miss out on his visits!
---
I did, yes, but like ThePsychlops says above, just scrap the cheapest piece. There's no need to create torsos to scrap them hoping for a torso mod. Somehow it's all universal.
---
Haha yea fuck that... They can spend the 20-40 caps like everyone else.
---
Random team requests are sketchy as fuck 
---
God I would love if mole rats were just removed from the game.  I hate them with a passion.  People complain about scorch beasts, no.  It's these little motherfuckers that will burrow under miles and miles of earth, and up through the air simply to be an annoyance.  And they spawn in groups.  I hate them.
---
See, now this is the answer I was looking for. Thank you for not being a dipshit like everyone else.
---
Lucien LaChance is the Mysterious Stranger confirmed.
---
If you are accepting half a million of anything from a friend, you know that they duped those items. Knowingly getting a leg up from someone else cheating is still cheating. 
---
Nope. Talons and Twisted Muscles are still in place.
---
Wait, is small letters rare?  That was one of the first plans I found.  *Might’ve* found it in a locked chest.
---
How did your son get into the silo at level 12? He shouldn’t be able to activate the hand scanner at the elevator, right? 
---
Sorry that I was not that much help but I’m glad you have now figured it out.
---
Fair enough, I never paid attention to the community when I played with 3 or NV. It only started with FO4 when I joined Reddit and saw the factional hate then. Like you have to be pro or anti-Bethesda. But  this game gets like even more crazy levels of hate, it's bizarre still.
---
I'm sure someone pointed this out before, but the TSE nerf breaking so many builds points to a much bigger problem in the game: the fact that ranged is woefully underpowered.
---
**especially** compared to melee.
---
I use the atomic shop Western drifter and cowboy hat (swap out for in game black cowboy hat sometimes) plus bottlecap sunglasses and red bandana
---
Eh. I accept most times. Never had a bad exp yet. Like me they probably dont have the caps. 
---
1800 bloody builds means probably not
---
Around lv50 I had a TS combat shotgun with vats crit cards etc. It was fun and all but one whitesprings run I'd go thru 500 shells. So I switched to melee from 75 to 120s building perks etc. Then the market crashed so TSE was cheap asf. Switch to the demo build right. Was glorius retribution to kill 5 glowing ones with 1 shell instead of like 25. Lol. 
---
I feel like it would be beneficial to create several areas like this as mentioned, not just the Golf Club. I find it fun and at least halfway challenging to go there to farm and others seem to agree since you can always see 3-4 people there. 
---
What you never see are people hanging out in the Mire, or anyone outside of Watoga (another halfway decent farming spot) in the bog. In fact, there are tons of areas around the map that are just empty voids that no one ever visits. As with FO4, it seems that once you venture far from the quest line locations the map is devoid of life. Less interesting stories or unique experiences despite some very cool spots with lots of potential. 
---
I want to say this looks like the same issue that causes people to accidentally dump gear into the hopper for the Feed the People event. Is there a dev on this sub?
---
Most of these people are right, but just make sure you’re minimum level 35 
---
Now it is back to normal with no rhyme or reason. Neato.
---
I think poison. You can get -25 poison on armor as a stat. I have 2 Combat armor pieces with -25 so I can have -50 if I wear them.
---
No there hasn't.
---
2* wooden armor? I'd buy it from you, if you weren't full of it.
---
well that's a lie :P
---
I just need as much as possible for my prime railway rifle 
---
You’re both acting like children 
---
I have gatling and 50 cal TSE, even prior to nerf fighting the Queen took a shit load of ammo. Now I dont even see a point in using the ammo lol. Also they added a terminal at the BoS base to give you all of the Ultricite armor plans. Not that I already had them but still just less incentive to kill her now. 
---
Or what if he came by, and had you help him to another players camp!?! To deliver gifts!
---
It sounds like you guys are being incredibly restrained on the B&amp; hammer. 10k items in 30 days is outrageous imo, so 150k in ludicrous and should be shown the door.
---
Keep up on the scumbags, its a shame you have to waste resources on this kind of nonsense. 
---
Exactly. Bethesda wants you to pick a playstyle.. but then lets you change it at the drop of a hat. The whole point of limiting perks is that you have to choose what to have, not to swap utilities in and out. Why not restrict it to combat perks only and have utilities be always on, and better yet only let you change them at your camp. Then you have to choose what to have when you go out.
---
I know right? who would believe bethesda after everything that has happened since beta?
---
Souper Douper!
---
That's a good combo sure. However if you don't plan on picking up much junk the second perk could go to Traveling Pharmacy (Strength) or Thru-Hiker (Agility). That way you can continue to live while picking things up as opposed to hoping you don't die as you pick up your 10th typewriter. It's all up to you as far as which weight perks to us. Strong Back is really good though because it covers everything.
---
Yes, this is perfect. Everybody gets a car!
---
HE’S FAT.
---
If it's over day for every item and they dupe 1 million bulk wood is that 1 million days or 30 million?
---
So who is the adult in this situation? 
---
Hey that was it I was using the junk extractor and I could have sworn it gave u actual junk so when I took it out and tried scrapping it and it said it wasn't their I was spooked.. but I guess they just give u the base components ? Haha 
---
No... 
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request. 
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited or however high they can get it (1,000, 10,000, etc). It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
yup lmaoo
---
&gt;Under normal gameplay conditions, you would not get that much candy.
---
I totally agree on all other items. But candy?! When you get 2k per run or 6k per hour you can easily get a couple hundred thousand over 30 days. It's just like farming monster mash 6-7 times per day.      
---
It doesn't even involves server hopping since you disconnect or crash every few hours or less. I farmed various locations but mostly got disconnected before I ended my farm run. Every run I started with Monster Mash or if it was not available West Tek.        
---
May you wouldn't consider that level of farming 'normal' but it's totally legit. It just takes some commitment. So I can't understand why I would have been banned if I just made a few more farm runs each day.
---
But... they have been fixing the broken things.
---
Now we need more content, balancing and QOL updates.
---
If the servers are still on I hope this game will have matured somewhat, something to look forward to I guess.
---
Hostiptals or any place you happened to saw microscopes or farm bots and hope for the best. 
---
Okay, for the sake of an argument, let’s say that he *did* do something ban worthy, does that still give Bethesda the excuse to deny him access to all of the other Fallouts?
---
Post in the market subs.. put what console w:cobalt flux h: caps..might be easier ..ppl have stable flux all the time I bought the crimson for marsupial..got responses in less than 10 mins
---
There's plenty of videos of guys doing this and if I see the queen going slow I switch up to do this exact thing.  Not into debating just saying look into it.
---
Ja Rule.
---
Hahahaha exactly 
---
This doesn't address the crux of your issues, but I just thought I'd note that .556 is easy to farm when you know where to look.
---
If you need steel, farm lower level super mutants at Grafton Steel or the Penitentiary, then scrap their weapons with Scrapper on. For lead, hit up Lucky Hole Mine. Once you learn where the nodes are, you can net ~120+ ore (300 scrap) per run, more with Excavator PA. And if you need acid for the ore, sit on a workshop such as Spruce Knob or Gov't Waste Disposal Site.
---
With Super Duper 3 and Ammosmith 2, I can crank out ~1800 .556 rounds for each trip to Lucky Hole.
---
I have, Ive bough over 50 and now I wanna get it myself 
---
Ah very good observation. I can see that working. Hopefully they can implement something. Even if it's just weight limit perks working with stash for now. But they can't get those to work normally so I believe your idea is better!
---
Thanks for the heads up, also the Marine Under Armor has the same effect, suppose it will get fixed eventually.
---
Ugg. I just noticed the shotgun nerf, too. My auto combat shotgun used to be the thing to take on mole miners, and now it's all fubar.  Thanks, Bethesda. The one reason I've stuck with this game was because I still enjoyed exploring the map, and now as a nerfed out level 27, I'm confined to the Forest again. I feel bad because my wife and kid splurged to buy me an Xbox One for Christmas solely because I wanted to play FO76. This piece of junk game is becoming a worse piece of junk by the week.
---
My biggest complaint is that my sneak multiplier doesn't work if an enemy aggros onto a different target other than myself.
---
The problem with TS and E were they were designed for single player. It didn't matter in a single player game if other legendary effects were underwhelming in comparison, you want a player to become a god at the end. 
---
You can't do that in multiplayer. The first thing they needed to do is establish baselines. That's why explosive is brought into line with other similar perks as was trueshot. 
---
Once that's done, they can start balancing all weapons and enemies (buffs and nerfs). 
---
If they didn't do this and started balancing enemies and new bosses around prior TSE values, every other legendary effect becomes useless and obsolete. E.g. "If you aren't max level and don't have TSE, stop coming to the new Behemoth King boss because he scales with player count and we need max dps to beat him."
---
The issue now lies with melee having a great many perks that strengthen it compared to other weapon types. So they'll have to look at that but also consider the drawback that melee has no range. 
---
They'll also need to add some perks for other weapons to bring them in line with others (i.e. pistols do not have an armour penetration perk but weapon types do).
---
They probably should have buffed grenades and non-legendary explosive weapons base damages up this patch however so that they wouldn't be so affected by the explosive perk changes, especially since they were already underpowered.
---
There was a flat 20% damage buff to all automatic weapons tho
---
Pretty much every time I need more of X, I just Google the phrase like this:
---
fallout 76 **fiber optics** locations
---
Substitute the **bold words** with whatever you're looking for (junk, aid, monsters, weapons, etc)

With all of the skills linked to doing the actions related to those skills, like the more you sneak the higher your sneak skill..or the more iron daggers you craft the better your blacksmith skills becomes...
---
Morgantown HS has a lab with a pile of microscopes. 
---
Duping items/bobbleheads/magazines/rare mats? It's way more than just legendary weapons.
---
Cool thank you
---
I had a 2 star ghoulkiller explosive pumo shotgun. I looted that bitch.
---
Its useless now. 
---
No, nerfing that combination was still necessary, no matter how you string it.
---
It was an obscene level of damage that caused more issues than it alleviates.  There might be a problem with damage resistance for sure, but the existence of an "I win" gun that zaps everything, including players in very few shots is not something to take lightly. 
---
Especially in a multiplayer game with *group content* and player-versus-player.  That's the consideration here.
---
I agree, but then people don’t need to put any points into those special stats and builds would be different, more optimal, and just further away from how it should be. I like the idea, but they shouldn’t be free perks.
---
This is like one of those hilarious opinion pieces from the Onion. Nice work! 
---
no prob
---
Haha doesn't change my experience but good note.
---
I have found 3 so far in 140 letters on two characters. But it is one of the 10k caps ones. I have never found letters and signs
---
I hopped over to Subnautica Below Zero while/until/if they fix this shit.
---
It's still early access, some stuff is broken, a bunch of various items don't even have entries in the in-game info database and it has my GTX 1080 HOWLING on low settings vsync'd because it's not optimized well yet, but it's still more consistent and stable than FO76 ever was.
---
Do you have any links to those videos?
---
What about swappable builds that could be named, and quick swapped by you in the perk section? So points are locked, but you could save and name a specific combination of perk cards for fast swap out. Example - you could be loaded up with the slugger perks( you name what you want ) then you can swap out to your heavy gun build ( named what you want) then swap out to your crafting build etc. you own the cards, and you're not switching out the points, you're just saving a select preset of how you want them. This would allow players to quickly swap between builds on the fly, and make things like lock picking and repairing armor much easier.
---
Where, exactly, have Bethesda ever claimed that stacked bobbleheads were bypassing slap mechanic?
---
We have multiple instances of video proof that over 100k damage does about 5% of a health bar when slapping.
---
I have only seen the Challenge option twice while playing, my husband has never seen it.  Is there a way to get this option to appear every time?
---
I just wanna hop in chally and hangout with graham all day 
---
Ah yes, because age ratings determine how entertaining a game is.
---
By that logic, I shouldn't enjoy Stardew Valley as a 32 year old dude because it's not rated M or PEGI 18 or anything, right?
---
Ironic.
---
If you're on PC there's a mod on Nexus for perk loadouts. You can even rename the slots. It makes life so much better. (No, you won't get banned for using this mod)
---
I've never had that happen. Pretty sure it only happens when you drop the nuke halfway outside the player zone.
---
If you want to do the no rads sbq fight *exploit*, and you get the glitch where she leaves the player area because you dropped the nuke South of prime instead of Northwest of prime, I feel like you really don't have a right to complain about it too much.
---
Yup. I disliked the energy weapons in the game and had so many energy cells I used to throw them away by the hundred. Then I picked up a Tesla rifle. Love it for the low level meanies.
---
There's so many easy ways to come across caps... Playing the poor card don't work.
---
Use travel agent to cut down on cost, take workshops, set up camp in strategic positions to limit costs.
---
Or just run.
---
I tend to agree.  Most of the perks I can see as equippable because they could arguable require a little prep on the part of the character; like you could roleplay something like Commando into your headspace by thinking your character packed his gear with running and gunning in mind when he left his CAMP...but your character shouldn’t *suddenly* forget how to make or effectively use explosives just because she’s been hacking terminals.
---
Not if they want to charge for mods
---
Well, look at that.
---
closest thing to a clean suit i have seen are the tuxes for new years
---
Ps4? 
---
The plan is called High-Tech Light Set and was sold by Phoenix (The Brotherhood of Steel vendor bot) in Watoga before the most recent patch. I haven't confirmed if he still has it since the patch though.
---
Just got this bloody thing too (Empath), now I'm going to have to decide if to obtain all the mutations first before doing the RadX &gt; rad pool lottery. So far I have:
---
Eagle Eyes - Egg Head - Empath - Scaly Skin - Talons - Twisted Muscles
---
What to do, what to do O\_o
---
Violet = Prime Fissure
---
Every other type of Flux = Whitesprings  (make sure you get the Whitesprings Train Station in the nuke zone)
---
The Whitesprings entrance nearest to the Train Station has tons of crimson.  Cobalt can be found all along the road inbetween The Whitesprings and the Train Station.
---
Those are really the only two locations you ever need to nuke (for both legendary drops and flux).  Everywhere else sucks.
---
Yup, level 18 Intelligence perk.
---
Non-combat perks should just be free passives. There should be more diversity in combat card options, so that we still have different builds. But the non-combat perks bog down the rest of the game by forcing you to switch gears manually.
---
Travel agent sucks. Camp is only one of 2 free travel locations. 76 and camp in two diff places still doesn't get you around. The train stations should be free travel
---
Oh yeah, I was all super proud of myself for grinding all those years and being totally legit, then they just threw it in my face when the gunrunning update released. So my friend bought a mod menu, logged in as me, and deposited 1b I to my account. Over a year later, I still have money and have never been flagged again. Neither has he. 
---
Dropping it it any knee deep water will make it unobtainable.
---
Well the email banning them was legit wasnt it?
---
"+(Up to) 50%, but only if *you* are mostly dead."
---
I assume you mean Bloodied, here - which you're completely wrong on, it does 50% bonus at 66% health. At 1% health, it does 150%. It's far more powerful than Two-Shot ever was considering you could simply pair it with sneaking and a friend to help respawn and be at basically no penalty ever, with its perfect accuracy.
---
With the rebalance of armour since FO4 being much more powerful, and most enemies having an appreciable amount, anti-armour regularly does on the order of +50% too.
---
The other legendaries being terrible doesn't really justify dragging two-shot to their level but leaving *better* ones unaffected.
---
The two-shot accuracy penalty is major, it is *very* common to miss one of the shots (and therefore at +25% only do 62.5% of what non-legendary damage would be) and it's not even uncommon to have both go either side of your target at anything beyond point-blank.
---
Yes! Somebody posted this a couple days ago and it’s been super helpful so I bookmarked it. 
---

---
I don't know how it works personally since I've never used a PS4 or playstation network.  He just said that he tried to logout and remove the Bethesda account from his PS, but it remains linked so he can't login to another Bethesda account.  I researched the procedure for unlinking accounts on his behalf, but that requires logging into Bethesda.net, which is no longer possible once someone is banned. At least this doesn't affect Xbox users.
---
The balance being that they are running around with only like 50 hit points. That's a pretty big penalty.
---
Disease cure or antibiotics 
---
They won't with the current workflow.  
---
Thanks it will save me a lot of caps.
---
I feel he meant don't make things up to get people to hate the game. Like the supposed glitch where peoplecould steal from your inventory. If there is a legitimate problem, like the friend list problems where people could use it or invite people, then yes make posts on it and bring it up until its fixed but DON'T make fake problems to simply get people mad.
---
And who would believe you?
---
Sick lot of fuck ups
---
stealth is also fucked with this bug, 
---
Tell me lies...
---
I totally agree and reflect the entire statement.  I am always either playing alone or with my wife. In either case i have no desire to accept or be inundated with team invites.  But we can't just have it turned off. We need to be able to restrict it to our friends list. (Xbox/ps4)
---
Quit whining
---
It does. Legendary effects do not show up as normal effects. I guess they did it because there can now be multiple legendary effects and fitting them all in that space is difficult. 
---
There's no way for me to confirm this. If that's truly what they want to do then they can move on to the next person. 
---
So, I had this habit in Morrowind of grinding my out-of-class skills while traveling between points of relevance or toward some distant quest.  I shudder to think of how that’d look in multiplayer, seeing someone long-skipping along the road while practicing throwing fireballs and chugging mana potions like it’s beer in a frat party.
---
There's about 7 other Fachsnacht masks - note I specifically mention the Man mask as an exception.
---
And they haven't been entirely deleted from the game, they were just removed in a wave from all inventories. Some people found plans for them, which they don't seem to have a tool to force un-learning, and others just kept going into the dev room anyway knowing that account would be banned.
---
I might actually have like 700 laying around 
---
How so?  Can you quantify it or qualify how it effects stealth in your experience?
---
So this is what? The third time a "major bug" has been widely claimed, reported by YouTubers and then completely lacked any evidence?
---
 Hmmm...
---
yeah, tens of millions is indeed fishy.
---
i played the halloween event only a few times, as a full stealth chameleon its not that hard to even run around and collect candy. never afked that event as i dont even know why i should collect them, because lets be honest, most rewards are garbage anyway.
---
so thanks for doing the math
---
Fix the game, not waste time on this poo. :)
---
Did you buy your x01 skin from atom store?  Those skins seem to show that little symbol.  
---
Don’t know why you ask what console, but no, i play on xbox.
---
Ya as a lifelong fallout fanboy (still) who started way back with the fallout 1 isometric rpg: 
---
This game sucks, Id rather play beatsaber too.
---
Thank you for providing that link.
---
Yes! This, so much this! I loved having this mod in FO4, it made all armor so much more configurable.
---
They spawn at carhenge NE of the ammo factory too. 
---
I understand. Im more abput helping other players out. But not everyone is willing and thats ok. I don't mind saving someone a few caps to use me to fast travel. In and out and done and i often get a thank you too for it. Some people give me stuff too. I always leave a bag of goodies for the person that lets me use them to travel for free. 
---
I’ve got a 3* Gatling gun that has the vampire legendary effect and I think either the reload speed or fire rate effect. Can’t remember the other one.  I can take Assaultron laser attacks and stay at full health while using it. Underrated effect, I’m a fan.
---
Do you know about [Nukes &amp; Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=)? It's a great resource to use prior to playing because you can create a build and see when each perk becomes available. Here's the list [mentioned by LCTC](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1411326&amp;d=at0lm0au0ih0if0iq0lf0p10p40l90l60lj0lq0p30ln0&amp;w=&amp;n=).  
---
Here's the list in normal text.  
---
Lvl 02. Pharma Farma (Luck)
---
Lvl 03. Scrounger (Luck)
---
Lvl 04. Green Thumb (Perception)
---
Lvl 12. Pannapictagraphist (Perception)
---
Lvl 16. Percpti-Bobble (Perception) &amp; Cap Collector (Luck)
---
Lvl 17. Woodchucker (Luck)

Lvl 50. Super Duper (Luck)
---
I added three perks not mentioned by LCTC. Those being Pharma Farma, Scrounger, &amp; Curator.
---
Have this problem with my 2 legendary Handmades, quite annoying.
---
Poverty is a disadvantage of ours yes.
---
Oof
---
Fair enough! 
---
Did you fast travel to Harper's ferry?
---
This company has ensured that at least this consumer wont preorder or maybe even buy another title with their name on it.  Tired of being let down and pissed on by this company.
---
If you were on PS4 I would sell them for cheap. 
---
IDs for *all* weapons are randomised. That's the entire problem; the IDs have to be unique to track a weapon *and its mods* with it, which means when a weapon is duplicated it gets re-randomised.
---
And there are limitations to every tool. People claim Bethesda can't even look at inventories at all, which is patently untrue - they can examine inventories plenty, and have now tools for tracking people gaining too many of an item over time. Individual items are a much more difficult thing to track.
---
They actually built it for that game. Level 99 survivalist let you cook big horner steaks, plus 10 carry weight. Where did you find those? One of the last areas of the game. They made it easy mode for food and actually allowed you to start hauling more so it added to your game play. Stuff like that made the game actually morr enjoyable to throw in a challenge.
---
Why is it everyone is hacking and dupers when people losing in pvp? There are waays to use perks, armor and chems to mitigate damage. If someone is specifically geared and jacked up on chems for pvp looking for a fight and you're just Joe Casual chilling at your base, don't engage them. Pretty simple.
---
Definitely has to be a bug of some kind, but it does look pretty cool.
---
I'd probably quit if they offered this. They need to fix issues, not offer new ways to monetize bandaid fixes. 
---
I hope not
---
Also, read the card at different ranks. Some perks provide a different benefit as they rank up. 
---
SO SAY WE ALL
---
Mine hangs for about 15 seconds, then closes back to desktop without error if I wait for it.  
---
If I had a dollar for every player that did not understand PVP in this game.  
---
I don't have two accounts psycho. I have these things called friends
---
Really? I mean, the diseases I have shouldn't have that effect. Buzz Brain reduces intelligence and Rad Worms increases rad damage, but like I said, no rads the entire time
---
...and cheaters cheat, crashing the servers. Also a known variable. 
---
yes it was, as i was suspicious me farming junk and other rare items via events and nukes would make me a target for banning.
---
What even is the point of PvP anyway?
---
A few caps? Some junk?
---
PvP in this game is borderline pointless.
---
They should make the survival servers then remove PvP from the regular ones.
---
You might as well give everyone unpatched tse. This game is supposed to make you sacrifice something to keep that card on and active. The only person that wants you to swap cards each time is you. They didn’t design it to be swapped, it was designed to be a sacrifice.
---
Yessir, even the playerbase
---
Well I will always agree with train stations being free travel.
---
You have no idea the costs and requirements of running an online service globally which actively has to save thousands of players hundreds of items coming and going. All at once.
---
It’s not as simple as changing a number....
---
Quite a lot on the big list to read through so apologies if this has been mentioned.....fix the marsupial mod....half the time isn’t doesn’t work since update/hot fix 
---
I don't know if it affects the whole server but it definitely affects those around you
---
Having to place them outside is likely supposed to be part of the "challenge" because that's where they're most susceptible to getting destroyed by creatures.  Otherwise you'd never have to worry about replanting a crop ever again once you'd safely fortified it on an upper floor of a structure.  Now sure you can build turrets outside to defend your crops or build an interior space with ground access, but that requires an extra investment of budget and space to balance out the convenience.
---
Amazing that is how it would look
---
It may have been, I don’t know. Points is I for downvoted simply for asking for more evidence.
---
Never said that but thanks for your input.
---
If they can not be killed, how on Earth am I supposed to be able to fight them? 
---
Sometimes that's all it used to do when the bug was a problem but this last time I tried I was still there for a good 5 mins before I closed it myself from task manager.
---
That's nice and all, but by the sounds of it he had a workshop and someone hunted him down.  Then he shot back after PVP was concluded and most likely had pacifist mode on doing no damage.  Would have been slap damage otherwise but he specifically said invincible so probably the former unless he was so weak it looked like no damage.   
---
I love when mass crafting having to endure Super-Duper's sound and graphic pop happening for the next five minutes.   Ugh.
---
Here, have some of your karma back.
---
If people are invincible, how is that PvP and not curb stomping through hacking?
---
Good to know it's affecting the entire server. I have taken to just pushing the buttons slower. I sort of drift off and meditate while slowly pushing 'E' (or say ONE and and TWO and and THREE) (which totally sucks but it's so much better than waiting for 'server is not responding' message to go away
---
Yes, let me unequivocally trust the word of the company that falsely advertised their products, has already banned those for entering the dev rooms, and has been removing, deleting and locking threads complaining about the rollback "patch" that has reintroduced many old bugs and added new ones.   
---
The "we dont want to reveal our methods of banning to stop people creating ways to avoid it" is a copy paste corporate bullshit reply used by every major dev team with similar banning controversies  
---
You can’t even spell adequate dude. 
---
Yikes!   Not good.  
---
Possible invisible enemy bug. If it happens again, equip a melee weapon and swing it around you for a while untill you gain some exp, that will mean that whatever was around is now dead. Sometimes it seems that some enemies fail to render and stay invisible, it's a rather uncommon bug.
---
I got a 3 day reddit ban for cussing at one of these guys cuz he pissed me off so bad with his lies. I got flamed hard too. 
---
Big smile today reading this. The 3 day ban was worth it.
---
This. Even the Inside the Vaults are just "we're fixing bugs &amp; working on new content for the next few months. Btw hope a no slap damage mode is good enough for 5 months wait!"
---
Having more perk points would fix this, why only 50 and not just 60 or 70. PER already needs a minimum  12 for shooting damage to be equal to a simple boxing glove
---
I agree with you on this but there are those who actually like it and don't hack. That is why I suggested keeping Hunted/Hunter and the events should stay PvP.
---
Yes, I do think it gives them that exact excuse. And the TOS would agree with me. Obviously you are too biased to continue this conversation, but if that bias comes from you engaging in the same action as the OP then I suggest you stop. Can’t wait for more stability and less cheaters in game myself! See you in the mountains.
---
I am on a phone an auto correct is a thing. Who shit in your cereal this morning?
---
I'm not going to just let someone accuse me of cheating man. That's not acting like a child that's standing up for myself and against slander.
---
I've crafted 200 leather arms in the last couple of days over 2 sessions (with super duper perk it became 300).
---
I scrapped all 300 on an alt character to test how we learn armour mods
---
I'm not banned. Recorded it as well because I was going to make a video about it.
---
Don’t know if it’s still a thing, but UVA people used to say all dirt roads lead to Tech (that was the 80’s before all their online growth). I always thought it was funny. I liked being associated with a country road college. Love that area of the country.
---
They should make it that she doesn't meat pile at all
---
Anyone crying wolf about being banned should be reviewed in this sub. 
---
Hm. I suppose that's possible. Even had one enemy fall through the floor completely while I was there, except he was supposedly killed but idk thanks tho
---
I had turned pacifist mode off before spawning back it. I took the guys health down to one, but no mater how many more time I hit him, he won't die. 
---
Whole server. Make them a couple at a time instead and you'll be done in the same time but won't slow down the servers.
---
Lol no. It's "thanks for the feedback" for every answer. "Were working on some fixed and stuff but won't get specific" for every inside the vaul. Then patched add bugs back in or just nerf shit.
---
I'm using Perk Loadout Manager, and I do loadouts for:
---
Combat  
---
Crafting  
---
Workshops  
---
Lockpick/Hacking  
---
Power Armor Crafting/Repair  
---
It's so much better than futzing with cards every time.
---
Back when it was a known bug I've hit quit to desktop and gone out of the room only to come back and still find it stuck there an hour later.
---
Check your blueprints. I think I ran into this problem where saved prints were taking up space. Something like this.
---
Grandama playing with numbers...
---
He sounds narcissistic. He just might just be a asshole but he also might also be mentally ill. Also who he befriends might have had that influence. As the saying goes it takes a village to raise a child.
---
Oh man.  If it makes you feel any better, the first and only TSE weapon I ever got was a plasma cannon.  I guess that's cool if you're a heavy gunner that likes to repair a lot or keeps a half dozen heavy guns on his/her person.
---
And for that matter do not do the lighthouse event either.  That fucking piece of shit event ate my sentinel right leg.  
---
I have my favorite painted so that helps but is even worse when they are in you stash you can not tell which is which.  The atom icon does not show up.
---
Yesterday i was down to my last fusion core so i went to a train station and went to see if i had one on my evacuater pa.  When someone else walked in i felt like such a showy asshole as i placed my 7th pa and the worst part was, none had a fusion core.
---
Also another thing i find annoying is they dont show what the plan makes and looks like once you pick it up or at the shops.  
---
Caps - you can farm people at their workshops given most are confused at how they got killed and continue to respawn in the immediate area to try and get their junk back or seek revenge.  The payout is obviously the cost of starting a capture deducted from the level of the player you are killing.
---
Junk - junk payouts are amazing for workshop PVP as most of that lot does not expect to get killed suddenly.  I once killed a player and gained 800lbs of bulked material.  In fact I have not had to scavenge myself for quite awhile now since I have an impressive stockpile of all the materials I need from doing this.    
---
I gotta a know - what did you find out?
---
You did, trying to be mr. Supreme “never said you did but thanks for the input”
---
Watch how you tone your replies.
---
But seriously, you don’t just change a number like this shit has to save SOMEWHERE. 
---
Increasing it would only lower server performance even more.
---
And if you’re going to be moody about being told sole truth, spell correctly.
---
P.S adiqite isn’t even a word. So that’s not autocorrect. Don’t talk bollocks mate.
---
No they arent. No they dont. Did Reddit ask for everything to be needed &amp; them to reintroduce bugs and do a no slap PvP mode instead of actual new content???
---
From the map screen press Z for menu, and challenges will be there. Only shows while in-game.
---
Enjoy being toxic dude. I'm sure you'll get far in life.
---
They wont. Even the Inside the Vaults are just vague promises. It's getting pathetic
---
Yeah nothings changed. The hotfixes are still one step forward and two back. Hotfix fixed three things and messed up 6, patch before that actually brought back already patched glitches. 
---
Its pure laziness and lack of testing over at beth for some reason. Someone isnt doing their job right, doesnt matter who but it needs to be addressed or else this game will take another 6 months to actually be fully patched and work as intended let alone expacs or added content. 
---
Sucks but it is how it is i supposed, hopefully they can get their heads together and work out whatever is clearly causing issues within the company/dev team.
---
The other event that uses a hopper has the same bug.  It's hard not to spam the button when the timer is counting down.  
---
You need to get pvp gear yourself if you want to pvp. Assassin's armor reduces damage by -8% from players for each piece. Sentinel -15% when standing still. Cavalier -15% while sprinting. Med-X -25%. Dodgy -30% for 30 AP. Blocker - 45% from melee attacks. Lone Wanderer -20%. Etc. If people are focused on pvp and know the game, and you don't, then you don't fight back until you know what you're doing and have better gear. There are ways to deal with people who have Sentinel like stagger them with the shotgun perk. And Dodgy deplete their AP with fast firing weapon. Or Radium Rifle does radiation damage. Etc. USe stealth. Use tactics. You can't just run and gun like CoD with people who are focused on PvP unless you are on their level.
---
That just sounds like a visual glitch then.  I've had times where in a fight my opponent and I would see our health bars hit 0 as many as 7 times before one of us actually died.  
---
Pretty sure it was a cargo bot which does say steal. Doesn't make you wanted at least not before the last patch, can't confirm myself.
---
Yeah, how does every YouTuber playing the game have every rare plan, and a TSE shotgun or whatever if they're so rare? I've been grinding since day one and never seen a TSE anything. I'm pretty sure there are a number of dupers asking themselves what their viewers are going to watch now if they can't one-shot some scorchbeasts. 
---
To the dirty filthy solo grinders out there, I raise a glass of cranberry hooch to you.
---
Let's not be delusional here, it is not. 
---
Xbox one. Body armor showing on outside of skins like the nuke cola girl outfit. 
---
'No criticism' leaves little else for content.
---
Agreed - though I was more thinking of players who stumble upon paper bags with tons of stuff in them either because a duper dropped the items or because a duper died (and dropped the items).
---
Basically that I was wrong lol
---
I thought scrapping arms would only teach arm mods. That you'd have to scrap chest armour to learn chest mods.
---
You don't.
---
Or they could just make legendaries scrappable for legendary materials. Then add legendary plans, which use the legendary materials to turn any weapon into a legendary. Then they could un nerf TSE, and buff some of the other effects, while also making all other legendary drops useful.
---
What did they do? 
---
Shh Todd, the cheaper you make them the more they’ll buy. You can sell them one 10 dollar skin and you’ll make 10 dollars or you can make the skins 3 dollars each and they’ll buy like 5 of them because they’re “so cheap”
---
"Well get back to you, this will actually be in next week's Inside the vault!"
---
 Next week's Inside the vault: mentions no details &amp; just a vague promise for months down the line
---
I’ve had this idea too thought it would make way more sense
---
All 3 levels are seperate cards so, to pick a lvl 3 lock you have to deselect 3 Perception points and then equip 3 locking picking cards, and nothing is alphabetical or sorted or whatever so yeah it is a pain in the ass and for anyone who doesn't want it then OK great for you for wanting to manually do 14 steps to equip to lvl 3 lockpicking, yay....fun.....should give you exp as well.......
---
Yes, it is poison.  
---
At least the dude took it out on the store's property and not the cashier.
---
You mean a way to open and close it with and without keypads? (If your on Xbox one ill help you wire it)
---
Melee sucked in 4 btw. Blitz was the only thing that made it usable 
---
And i’m sure stupidity and lies will get you even further, right?
---
No hate in my post. Only positive!
---
I would like to be able to to change armor from light/study/heavy and back again. One side of my character is light combat armor and the other side is heavy... It's not even the side that would be facing an enemy when shouldering or aiming.
---
+1 for this mod. 
---
Power to the middle of the door keeps it powered and open, the keypad allows power through the door. You want a switch built on the other side, pressure plates work really good. You run power to the switch then to door.
---
Lmao
---
Hey dude, the burden of proof is on you - post a link to this happening and there’s no need to debate.
---
I personally hate this change because everyone that actually grinded for the Ultracite plans  got kicked in the head
---
Whats was the shotgun? I can craft most things and mods and would be happy to replace it for adding to the proof that people are bullshitting.
---
If you’re not going to use them I’ll take them/buy them off you, if you’re xbox
---
Well you're doing all of that so you tell me. I am being stupid right now though wasting my time replying to someone who's clearly sick in the head.
---
What Bethesda is saying is don’t play monster mash. 
---
You must have some pretty low standards if you think this is the best game ever developed. 
---
thanks :)
---
I don't want campfires in my house, though. &gt;.&gt;
---
2. n/a
---
3. n/a
---
4. this happens often: when trying to access a terminal in power armor, the game will just freeze. you can't escape out or tab out. you can only alt-tab and close the game from windows
---
Grognak no agree. Grognak design  game. Game good  for  Grognak.
---
One VATS crit hit to the spouts, and then it's all good from there
---
U can make a second profile just for bethesda games at no cost. Won't even have to rebuy the game
---
Looks like the nuke overlaps the in-game border. If the SBQ flies within the nuked area, but ventures out of the game map, she might get confused with pathing and just not come back.
---
You thought that you could sprint, standing up, and somehow be in stealth with that perk?  And we are also supposed to think you're an expert on stealth when you present your evidence?
---
My house has a barn with an adhesive farm, a cow, and 2 purifiers.
---
It's the only part of my house I need to keep locked, which is nice.
---
Says the person using auto correct when it clearly didn’t auto correct a word that doesn’t exist to cover his tracks of being a blabbering fool? Cool, gotcha, noted.
---
If you could save like 3 “card profiles” and select between the different profiles so all the card swapping is taken care of for you. You could have like a stealth profile, hacking/lock picking profile, etc
---
Sorry, that's the only option rn.  Unless you want to leave open spots of dirt in between foundations
---
1% health isn't playable. That's single digits hit points. That's dying just because you jumped and the place you landed was a foot lower than where you jumped from. I have a bloodied .44, and it's good, but not amazing. I have a bloodied DC gauntlet, on the other hand that can get crazy damage, but that's not just bloodied, it's bloodied with 5 unyielding armors, several perks, and several mutations, all synergizing into one whirling ball of death. And by death, I mean mostly my own because I get one-shot by level 5 scorched.
---
Anti armor, is really good. But also, armor penetration is diminishing returns. So that 50% penetration is huge on, say, a Western revolver, but not very significant on a melee weapon, which already has 75% penetration from incisor, or a rifle which has armor penetration from perks, AND magazine mods.
---
Ps4....all the time . Healing factor not healing
---
Still on about auto correct.  Damn dude your manic depression got the best of you this morning.
---
You can build an attached barn to the side of your house (or under half of it) with no foundations to fix that issue.
---
Dammit, now I want this! Looks awesome
---
Nerf bat knocked the fun out of e erything other than melee. The old meta is once again the new meta so.... no it’s not really fun anymore.
---
It still has big stability issues and it's missing a lot of QoL things to be considered a good game. Also since it was advertised as a MMO it's missing a lot of options that'd let people socialize ingame. 
---
It can be pulled out by the ears to be a great game, but in the state it is now it most certainly isn't.
---
I'm positive you haven't played anything good in a while.
---
Same. Maybe this is a known issue... I hope.
---
It is always my left leg, and it drives me nuts!
---
There is a sneak penalty to "running" while crouched, the perk simply removes that penalty.  There are no other effects.
---
Lol holy shit its a hard counter
---
Actually I've seen a bag of duper stuff laying on the ground. Thousands of items. I left it because I have what I need and I didn't want to go through the annoyance of moving it to a mule but I honestly could have picked it all up and would have been banned. Seems a bit scroogy to ban someone who found stuff whether it was legit or not, in real life if I find a million dollars I'm not leaving it on the ground. If a new battery found 20k nukas on the ground do you expect them to leave it there or pick it up?
---
Although I like the costume some people have said those costumes give the game an air of pay to win seeing as you buffed players +15 hp was it per different costume? Is this going to become a thing, as in payed for buffs?
---
Coal miners LTD edition? Awww yeah. 
---
Did you buy the actual marine legs and marine arms, or did you buy something that said cushioned/strengthened/etc marine armor limbs?    If you bought the latter that’s just a mod fir the armor.  You actually have to get the arm and leg plans.  I found the arm, leg, torso, wetsuit and tat helmet plans over a month long period in Harpers Ferry in those display cases.  Just search them every time you go there.
---
No amount of gear or perks will be able to stop people from one tapping me before PvP is even initialized and then over come the fact that they do not lose health when they sit at a silver of health.
---
I’ve only ever found the dirty two piece suit. I don’t think the others have been added into the game yet. I’ve been getting really annoyed with so many cosmetics not being available to find in game and then Bethesda only adding more in through the atom store. 
---
Ultracite armor.  It was a quest reward for completing Belly of the Beast.  I lost or scrapped mine accidentally.    It was irreplaceable, almost.  Apparently the Queen would occassionally drop the plans.   In their last update they put the plans for this armor on a terminal at Fort Defiance.  
---
Bethesda must really be laughing at everyone on Reddit, I'm sure they have a good laugh over our posts in the lounge in between coding.
---
No. But my frame rate, which is usually quite good, goes to hell inside Glassed Caverns, despite a very, very state of the art PC and a pretty stable connection. I can easily imagine that other players might effectively stutter to a halt there. That's not really an explanation, nor direct confirmation, but commiseration. 
---
I haven't scrapped it, so just dropping in water should work.
---
Ok I item should be no more. 
---
Yeah it’s weird. I built a camp and maxed out budget, didn’t touch anything, and a few days later I had 1/6 budget free again. I don’t get it, but I’m not complaining!
---
You made yourself a target by attempting to come across from a superior position.
---
Like i said, be careful what you say and how you say it.
---
Again a score for lack of intelligence i guess. But you blame me, it’s ok. I’m not the one struggling to understand a concept of technological hardware limitations and performance impacts from having data being written globally live.
---
Have you tried to play a game whilst installing one? Or tried to use your PC whilst doing a windows update? Tried using your phone whilst it downloads and installs updates? 
---
Ever noticed the slow down? 
---
That's pretty cool, thanks
---
I got mine done from drinking purified water haha. I think it just counts any aid item?
---
You just trash bro
---
Lol @10690 rounds of .38 you will never use
---
That doesn't mean they're working. I have marsupial, had it for quite some time. Starched genes never come off. It's still listed. Doesn't work. Relogging sometimes fixes it and sometimes doesn't. 
---
So you think that to deal with negative press and the damages from it they would ban innocent people who do play the game and then when confronted publicly lie about it? That doesn't speak to why they would do that at all. That would be counterproductive. Meanwhile, the guy who got banned would have a logical reason to lie. 
---
To believe a random person over Bethesda solely because Bethesda has lied previously is asinine. I understand the 'innocent until proven guilty' stance on trust, but that isn't an excuse to not look at the situation beyond that. 
---
No because you still have to complete belly of the beast.  I must not have been the only one who somehow lost the inital armor.
---
Did you check your inventory status screen that shows all your resistances? Maybe it didn’t show up on the item interface but the resistance is calculated within anyway?
---
&gt; 「Ｃａｎｎｅｄ Ｄｏｇ Ｆｏｏｄ」
---
Tremble before the power of my stando! ***「Ｃａｎｎｅｄ Ｄｏｇ Ｆｏｏｄ」***!
---
That's a graphical bug. See I'm giving you advice, but I guess you don't want it.
---
Or. Create a card pack system that I can save/load any time I want.
---
Well I would have. I’ve played very small amounts of the game on and off since it came out so I’m really zoned out from what I’m supposed to be doing. I would’ve read it ages ago but I’d forgot.
---
I’m getting into it now though. Still confused by some thing but I’ll get there
---
So? I grinded my ass off to launch nukes to get the Ultracite plans, then Bethesda makes it you can get them all for free
---
You played the Monster Mash event yet?  PVP is fun. Losing can be fun too. It’s just a game.  
---
You’re asking the impossible. That’s like shutting down society until we can stop crime. 
---
Yeah I didn't sleep and realized I was too sleep deprived (and not experienced enough really) to give advice so I abandoned ship after the one piece of solid knowledge I could provide 
---
You're really triggered. Turn off the internet.
---
They can't eve fix simple bugs. Why do people keep making this kinds of posts. It not going to fucking happen. Pull your head out of the sand. 
---
You have your own materials or need them farmed for you?
---
same ! I just passed mine onto a low level player though . 
---
Same here on Xbox 
---
I bought the game last wednesday, eager to play with my friend who is already playing, he bought it a week or so and he is having a ton of fun...
---
Unfortunately, I have a bad internet, and a wall of 50 gigs is in my way which takes 40 hours to download. to make it worse, after they released the hotfix the other day I had to diascard ~20 gb already downloaded from patch 1.08 LOL. 
---
Nevertheless I'm excited to start playing...
---
Kudos if you get the anchor reference. 
---
Your grammar is so atrocious, you shouldn't critique the spelling of others. 
---
Ps4
---
Okay * Bethesda games have been known for bugs but have been great regardless 
---
They promised content yet never dlc ...
---
I’m guessing nothing new from the pre existing setting of the game more like , “activating” new mechanics 
---
Current projections seems to suggest March based on different comments from the Community managers and Developers.
---
If you're on PS4 I'd be interested in it
---
I just recently started a melee/power armor alt, and I have one rank of luck of the draw.  I played for about 6 hours yesterday (almost to lvl 20) and had it proc twice.  Definitely not worth the investment, but I got it in a card pack and it's just a placeholder until I can access luck perks that I want.  Maybe it's better with three ranks but I don't really mess with too many perks that involve random chance or only work 50% of the time (sunkissed, for example).  The one exception is Mister Sandman for my sniper.  I come alive at night with that one.
---
The original doesn't. You just used a mod to give it a different renderer that does. Far easier to do with a 2D game than a 3D one.
---
Very insightful comment.
---
Yup, new stealth bug introduced in the Hotfix.
---
LMAO the last video is Literally the buildable Cave and my base you are making yourself look so stupid dude seriously stop. The first two vids were for my buddy I thought it was really cool I could get spawned there. Please come raid me.gt eternalscourge I promise I won't be under the map I have an 800 cap bounty right now.
---
Facts tho
---
No, I have no skins bought from the store at all.  All my headlamps give a nuclear symbol currently.  I think I heard it was a bug, or it was in preparation for future changes.
---
You cant they didnt code one so that is a one way street im afraid
---
PC, sorry. Working on changing my build to utilize it anyway, so not sure I'd wanna sell.
---
And you’re really stupid, stupidity triggers me.
---
Who knows if they'll ever even get around to making new content, they're so busy running around putting out fires they keep re-igniting themselves because they're accidentally patching old builds of the game. They're working on Survival mode (PvP always enabled servers) and that's going to be a mess that will distract them a lot.
---
I’ve only seen two and both were at taranga town 
---
oh definitely check white springs,  quite a few of my armor and gear was stuff others sold at vendor  or dropped in bags /left at the ice chest . I'm finally high enough that I try to play it forward and drop things off at the ice chest or in train stations . I'm happier thinking it is going to other players 
---
Or they could just do it like Assassin's Creed and make it an automatic passive perk that you get every 15 levels or so.
---
I just want the ability to quickly switch between “hands” of perk cards (without needing to go into the perk section). A load out for exploring, Nuke Zones, crafting, etc. Nothing is gained by making the process tedious.
---
It's unlikely that the people fixing bugs are the same ones adding new game resources. 
---
How much XP does that yield?  Though about doing this with an XP boosting food but I don’t think it’s all that much. 
---
At one time, when you would visit someone's camp, the camp device would show their gamertag. At least this was the way it was before first patch on xbox. It disappeared and since then you don't know who's camp it is. I use the small letters and place on a sign. That way, people visiting, know who's it is. They usually write me and tell me the camp is awesome. I've spent 50+ days in FO4  building, so each time I move my camp, I like to build it different each time. A tip, the floor mat still let's you move items and manipulate placement.
---
This is a typical freeze - sometimes, soon as I open Task Manager, the game will unfreeze, but most times, that is not the case.
---

---
Make combat skills only level in combat or in designated zones. For example, the shooting ranges and carnival games could increase skills. Maybe you could build a shooting range or relevant skill-trainer at you CAMP?
---
Thanks
---
First is not very good unless you go for powerarmor with increased unarmed damage and tesla coils that add energy damage to fists, and even then it might be weak. Pistols can be good though, with the right perks. A good two handed weapon is recommended for melee.
---
Get some mental help. For all of us please.
---
It doesn't exist or hasn't been added yet.
---
Huh, I swear they said they would add DLC
---
Using this argument, that is "players shouldn't use exploits because we put it in our TOS", is not OK as you could put ANYTHING in the TOS and pretty much no one reads them.
---
If you want to explain yourself, then explain why bans were employed instead of patching the issue and removing the items.
---
In a free to play game, banning can generally be employed whenever, as the banned player can create a new account and start from scratch again.
---
Here, you're basically refusing to provide a service that the banned player PAID for. (And yes, I m still waiting for the playable experience I paid for)
---
Because of the up front fee, banning shouldn't be used when the developper messed up and let a duplication glitch in the game.
---
What I'm seeing this as is you messing up, and instead of fixing things properly, you take back a product that you sold from someone who pointed out the issue.
---
Looks and runs smoother in my opinion yet the new bugs are annoying.
---
I had a group of ghouls named mole rats and exploding like robots...
---
And I was flying ... literally unable to hit the floor or loot.
---
16 times the detail :)
---
Yuuup
---
&gt; Your son was exposing himself on camera in Uno.
---
Go east on the map. That’s where the good stuff is.
---
Isn't March when the survival mode comes out? So is the survival mode the dlc?
---
PvP is fun when both people want to participate in it. When it is forced onto someone who just wants to PvE it is incredibly frustrating. And I do not thing it is impossible at all. It would simply reduce the amount of griefing as people would not be able curb stomp those not prepared for PvP.
---
This is what I want.
---
Would be better if it were just a passive of AGI and INT. Every 5 levels gives you +1, so you'd need 15 in those skills to bypass lvl 3 locks/terminals. 
---
I’ve met 2 people with a mic the whole time I’ve played 
---
*roaring applause* 
---
How bizarre 
---
You never played a Bethesda game before did you?
---
Read the least patch notes they nerfed just about everything but melee either through stat changes or perk nerfs.  Honestly if you have been gone 2 weeks the only new things you missed were in the atomic shop.  Game is dying fast and sadly i dont think they can save it
---
Auto correct hur hur i’m a liar hur bur listen to me guiz an my adiqite advice hur hur
---
That currently seems to be how this is all going to play out, at least until they finish fixing the game, and really get some time to inspect all the bans.
---
But judging by how draconian this sub is about duping and other forms of cheating I don't see Bethesda taking any steps back from how aggressive this all is.
---
And personally I take that all to mean one should avoid any multiplayer games Bethesda releases because they're busted and the community is pretty hateful about cheating in a mostly cooperative game, so imagine how caustic and mean they'd be in a game where we aren't all supposed to be friends 
---
oh fffuuu
---
Hopefully once they finish patching bugs they'll start adding content
---
Someone needs their nappie changed
---
It took me about 2 days of server hopping to find my jetpack. Good luck, you’re going to need it.
---
Tl;DR: I don't like PvP so no one else should PvP.
---
 CTD's ?
---
Silver Shroud Costume plus Black Cowboy Hat. That's what I'm running now.
---
Other fits for me might include using a fedora possibly, the clean black or dark grey suits [when available]. 
---
The sniper costume is meh.
---
I haven't yet gotten a hunters longer so not commenting there.
---
Now you're acting like a child. Good luck buddy. You'll need it.
---
Doubt it considering people told them that they need to get their shit together and not deliver buggy messes for years now and it hasn't happened.
---
Under power connectors there are two categories for the conduits, the top one with the various connectors and the one just below it with the various conduit pipes. Wall passthrough is under the top option, all the way to the right if I'm.not mistaken
---
I think that stash needs a complete coding overhaul. 
---
It should store two types of items - scrapped junk and real items. 
---
Scrapped junk/mats should have much more space as recording the amount of mats you have in the database shouldn't be too server intensive. 
---
However, storing weapons, armour, food is much more server intensive.
---
Each item can be modded, has durability bars, different stats to do with weight and value etc. 
---
So imagine if stash allowed for basically 500 of each scrapped component, and then 300 or so space, specifically for weapons, mods, armour, food, aid. 
---
If they want FO76 to be heavy on the farming grind, then let us store our farm easily, without having to drop that two shot gatling gun we are saving for the one day, when we may respec to heavy weapons. 
---
Did that work? 
---
I've tried to send an invite to a higher level that helped me out a bit. But when I sent the invite a message popped up saying "this player isn't accepting invites at the time". Idk if this was a server issue or the player had it set like that.
---
I've read the comments here and understand the issues with hopping, etc. But my beef is with Fortune Finder now. Previously, the caps locator beacon was only present when there were actual caps to be had, not just an empty box.  
---
I saw Fortune Finder as having two benefits: It helped you locate unknown caches (worth carrying the card and still works for that), and it would let you know if a known cache was full without having to go look (now broken).   
---
If @Bethesda would modify Fortune Finder to alert on "caps" rather than their container, it might work better without breaking the container model.
---
RAM usage looks fine to me - game grabs between 2-5GB out of 16GB.
---
Yes I believe they did buy what I meant is that wording might had been really deceiving and perhaps use atom shop as what they meant ?
---
Didn't say it should be remove entirely. If you're gonna do a TL;DR, you actually have to read it...
---
north part of Germany here, near Karlsruhe. Didnt happen at the start of the game but coming daily and quite often now. Prolly Franfurt Gate issue, like this game doesnt have already enough issues...pretty frustrating
---
Oh no I'm aware, I have an attached barn on the side of my house for exactly this reason.
---
Just wanted to clarify that while that is an option, it's not a very satisfying replacement.
---
The time it takes to swap lockpicking cards is more valuable to me than whatever is locked in any container. Not exactly legendary weapons and armor in there.
---
I get it, and I don’t disagree with the sentiment, I just don’t think we’ll ever see a 100% exploit free game.  Especially not after what we’ve witnessed from them so far.  
---
Maybe the best potential for my personal taste in gaming. So far though, the game is far from where it should/could be. My concern is that Bethesda may wipe their hands of it, rather then push on. In reality, this game only exists because they had no other game slated for 2018. No wolfenstein, no Doom, no Elder Scrolls, no Evil Within. Had to give share holders something. 
---
I feel the stash size is a nice control for my character. I have refined my build quite a lot. I have trapper armor, which requires plastic, steel, rubber, adhesive and cloth I think. I also use spears and tomahawks exclusively, which need wood and steel. So that’s 6 or so materials I need to collect for repairs. I have like to have about 500 of each which is a habit I have left over from trying to learn mods from building and scrapping. 
---
On top of that I keep good 3* drops that other folks might be interested in, and a hundreds of aid items I’m saving for player vendors. 
---
I also have a shed load of notes and misc in there as they have zero weight and I like my characters inventory clean. A couple of rare outfits too. 
---
I think that’s about it, and honestly I don’t make much impact on my stash limit. Obviously I wouldn’t object to more storage, but not at the expense of performance. 
---
One thing I noted from what you said was this was game based around collecting, but perhaps whilst previous titles were, maybe 76 isn’t? All the items I initially thought I’d collect, like the mr fuzzy variants etc, they respawn. There’s not point in collecting them really.
---
Looting a supply drop you did not call in gives you a bounty now if you are the first one to it, essentially if you pick the lock on one you didnt drop have a 5 cap bounty
---
That's part of the feel of the game, though.  Scarcity is important for immersion and many people agree.  Creating passive perks just = power creep.  
---
Yes, at a certain level, you have all the perks you want and need and it's just a matter of whether you're too lazy to swap them or not, but that is a very high level when you've obtained most of the perk cards.  Making passive/0 point cards gives that power at earlier levels.  
---
A better solution IMO is swappable perk pages.  Even simplifying to the point of swapping from your favorites wheel.  You'd really only need 2 pages (Combat/Crafting) and could offer more pages slots via Atom shop.  This simplifies the tedious swaps of current, but keeps immersion in that you need different tools for different jobs (same as how you hop in and out of power armor for stealth v. combat for example).
---
Yeah loot behind walls isn't even worth it half the time anyways 
---
Pics or it never happened.
---
Yeah I absolutely am taking my time to soak in the game. I don't personally believe the environmental storytelling is that great or clever as a lot of people do, it's just there and is something a lot of games don't do. The Dark Souls franchise on the other hand does this much, much better, for example.
---
The question was about how appropriate the game is for kids. What Fallout game do you think would be best? I suppose Fallout 4 is not a bad choice either and probably would not be as frustrating to play according to some of the comments here. But compared to all the rest I firmly believe 76 is the lightest in this regard. Few kids care about atmosphere or immersion or the story of a skeleton lying on the ground.
---
I haven’t tried it yet, I’m playing fo3 but the next time I get on 76 I’ll definitely try it out
---
I don't think atom shop is dlc, if it is then I will personally go to Bethesda's studio and start a protest
---
The one in fo4 I thought was acid. All I could do was lob grenades
---
I think the dev room is only off limits, they are aware of these glitches and nobody can prevent them. If you're worried, submit a ticket to tell them about it, sobit looks like you're trying to get it fixed
---
I had potential to be. Maybe it still does. Who knows.
---
This isn't a how-to build guide. Just because I produce a semi interesting 30 second clip doesn't entitle you to my entire build. If I'm an athlete successful on the field you'll see the results of my effort and hard work but not every step of how I got there.
---
This.  
---
My suspicion is their content delivery timeline is way late b/c of all the server issues and duping exploits eating up development time.  The question is how delayed are they?  Also, can we expect the new content to be equally buggy (because they are scrambling to deliver) or are they gonna double their QA efforts?
---
Yessir.  Perk pages that you can swap from favorite wheel.  2 pages would be plenty for most, and then more perk pages from Atom Shop would be pretty fair.
---
I’ve no time for someone who lies out their ass when they’re caught, just admit you’re stupid an have no idea how to spell or that you have a clue what you’re talking about.
---
Nothing worse than people adding to something they simply don’t understand, like trying to fit in somewhere they don’t belong.
---
That was literally the most messed up thing I have ever witnessed in video games.
---
I have found him 3 times at Poseidon Charleston plant (xbox) in the past week. Look there.
---
They are used for crafting hallucigen gas grenades, and also in a quest line crafting sequence
---
I understand there will be exploits, but when the game is this buggy and messy, PvP should be completely unrestricted. 
---
Doesn't have to abandon ps4 account. New ps4 account on same ps4, play whatever bethes game he wants, switch to original account and play whatever games he likes. Have your friend do a little google research as there is way more info out there than my couple sentences and he'll be back playing whatever he wants in no time
---
&gt; "This game is stupid, lets go play Beat Saber." I agree lets go play Beat Saber. 
---
Your son is smart.
---
Yet you spend almost 30min typing nonsense to me. Ok kid get some help.
---
I agree lol they have been tricking the shit out me ( most of us maybe ) lately that I highly doubt it takes this long to fix and test such bug , specially having a supportive community that not only documents but also investigate the roots of certain problems.
---
“ largest team we have working on a game”
---
No, it REALLY wasn't.  it's rather fucked up that the majority of the people here saw some random guy post "I GOT BANNED FOR CRAFTING THIRTY GUNS!" with zero evidence and jumped on the bandwagon that of course Bethesda had fucked up again and was punishing honest players.
---
I'll check it out. Thanks.
---
Kid 😂says the person actually below 25.
---
Because you know my age? Ok.
---
As much as I've enjoyed aspects of the new perk system, this one drives me insane. I see level 3 locks and just ignore them now :(
---
Bethesda is probably just cursed, after their great line of success they now have, failure
---
This is why we can't have nice things...
---
Bethesda support is so clogged up that they weren't able to completely resolve my bag issue until about 2 weeks ago, and these whining cheaters are only making things worse for the innocent.
---
I just like bulking my stuff a bed giving it away
---

Cane across them yesterday
---
The recent trend of a lot of major game companies is to release their games in earlier stages of development, since they now have the ability to patch as they go. Start earning profit sooner, and we, the players, are paying the company to play their half-baked games and report bugs/exploits as they occur. We’re essentially testers that the company makes money off of.
---
I hope Bethesda turns things around soon and Fallout 76 succeeds. I truly do. But I also hope it becomes an example of why this new mentality is so terrible, and how it negatively affects what has been an incredibly loyal fan base for a long time.
---
The only one I ever ran into was earlier this week, near Watoga at the train car with the plans in it. 
---
So he can go into a silo at level 12?....doubtful
---
Man, even just let us make presets we can one-click to. Swapping multiple cards for mundane chores is not worth it.
---
Marine armor spawns in cranberry bog the most so best to check the spots there flooded trainyard has 7 possible plan spawns
---
Drop sites also have 1 spawn each apart from v9 
---
Three quarters of people who use the term “kid” in a debate/argument/discussion tend to be young, using it as a patronising insult to show a clear lack of experience.
---
I’m far from a kid and i know full well the intention behind the word being used in this scenario.
---
Prove you’re not.
---
You really can't believe anything that Juicehead says.  His release history is proof that he's simply saying anything that drives up his channel hits.  Likewise, 99% of the YT and Game Media channels giving negative press are just riding the hysteria bandwagon.  Be critical, and 'trust but confirm' when you're hearing any argument made to appeal to an extreme.  
---
I like it! 
---
I do not think he even realizes why he died given he claims PVP was not initiated.  I am 99% sure it was the typical workshop victim.  
---
Oh and no more duping( insert finger shaking to appease the masses...)
---
I'm just tired of going through a dozen duplicate cards to get to the one I need, I'm level 129 and have a so many perks I will never use and duplicates of perks that I do use my swapping is a long and tedious process. It takes me 2-3 minutes to switch from adventure to crafting. None of the duplicate and useless cards were picked by me, it was all the automatically added perks they give you. I really wish this had been like all the others and was just a matter of using a skill to get good at it, that's what life is after all.
---
I will, thanks. He hadn't been able to figure it out and I got stumped trying to research it since everything pointed to resolving the problem with Bethesda.net. I figured this was the best place to look for answers.
---
Mind boggling 🤯 don’t get me wrong ain’t bashing over here but damn , it’s been quite few months and nowadays getting something you “want” will cost you a shitload of time. ( 75% happy about 25%frustraded)
---
I’m level 48 but it’s just something that has always happened to me wanted to know if anyone else was experiencing something similar it’s not really a huge deal 
---
If you play with fire you're going to end up getting burned.  Bethesda doesn't need "dupe hunters" running around being vigilantes and has warned people against picking up suspicious items.  Ultimately their actions are meaningless anyway since all the dupers have to do is go and dupe more junk.
---
FO76 probably works for kids because they dont see the world the way an adult would. Dont look for the symbolism or the meanings behind skeleton placement, or objects in their vicinity. The other games, though, have speech and language that is harder to avoid.
---
My case is PvP shouldn't be forced on those who do not want it, especially the game being in the state it's in. You response is just to build my character around PvP. 
---
Meh I figured as much. People will instantly upvote some poor sob story of how they got banned but did nothing wrong. And since everyone's upset over the newest patch they just assuming the OP is telling the truth. And Bethesda are idiots. Shame cus puts devs at a rock in a hard place.
---
I warned them that they could be flagging their accounts by doing that, and got downvoted to oblivion...
---
Looks wayyy better lol 
---
this is good.
---
No, this game is definitely not for kids.  The surface game is OK, there's a bit of blood but not terrible.  The worst parts are the story though, which have VERY adult themes and plots.  Like, the darkest of class warfare.  Good people turning to murder and cannibalism.  Killing for women, and of course rape.  Some of the holotapes have very realistic screaming from torture and/or fear.  There's one tape from a kid who's dad never comes back after the bombs drop.  Alot of these tales are traumatic for adults, much less kids, unless you want to raise a sociopath.
---
I'll let my kid play a little when I'm doing screw/spring grinds or something, but I only run the plot stuff when alone 
---
&gt;A huge aspect of this game is to collect items.
---
You'd like that to be a huge aspect but clearly it's not.  If the developers intended you to collect every weapon or armor there wouldn't be storage restrictions.  If you're not regularly using something, sell it, trade it, junk it, abandon it.
---
Good advice
---
Damn dude if you're not a kid I am sorry. Because you act like a complete idiot with no sense of anything an are so far disillusioned from life you'll never recover. I don't need to prove anything to you. Thanks for the chuckle about how fucking triggered you became over auto correct. Enjoy living your life in complete an utter misery because that's what's in store for someone like yourself. Again I say good luck, you'll fucking need it.
---
If you're on PC I'd appreciate having some.
---
Well he has played FO76 so it hasnt been that long since he played something good.
---
That’s a really good idea! Different pre made loadouts and perk builds would be a great addition.
---
PS he keeps sending me crazy ass DMs.
---
I have some extra legendaries I doubt I'm going to use
---
What platform are you on? 
---
I can live with 600 stash size but would love a little more. But that would probably lead to players asking to up it a little every new patch. People are saying it will be harder on servers but with the latest reduction in inventory amount and   less duping going on, I would imagine the servers would improve or stay somewhat the same.
---
Says the lonely bastard with 2 thousand reddit karma.... lying to excuse his stupidity on the internet,
---
Crack on lonely one.
---
I read that you can't use fists with power armor, unless something has changed?

---
The correct way is to be affirmative and flag each item that can be autoscrapped, not mark each item that can't be autoscrapped. NoAutoScrap makes it confusing as they have to remember the flag is to not do something rather than to do something, and they have to remember to add it to future items that are not supposed to be autoscrapped. They won't remember to do this.
---
They should start with an autoscrap flag. If an item has this flag set then it can be autoscrapped. By default, items would not have this flag set, a developer has to set the flag. If somebody forgets to set the flag, which they will do, then nothing bad happens. The player is confused why something won't autoscrap, but that's better than something vanishing that isn't supposed to autoscrap.
---
Now we have to think, is there anything outside of junk that we would want autoscrapped? No. So when autoscrapping we only look for junk items. Even if something else somehow gets the flag set it won't matter, it's not junk so it's ignored. There could be junk items we don't want to autoscrap, or the devs could allow the user to select junk they don't want autoscrapped, so we still want to keep the autoscrappable flag.
---
This leads to another question, why not autoconvert junk to their components on pick-up? They might have plans to use junk items in another way.
---
I'm surprised with the many decades of dev experience they would even consider a negative flag. It would be like reversing a bool datatype where 1 is false and 0 is true.
---

Your sir just made me basicly the guy from the movie equilibrium 😆
---
That, would maybe be nice. But there should be good loot behind lvl 3 doors to make it worth, it would also make exploring even more worth and fun.
---
This is fully legit. All you need is a chestpiece with dense and fireproof rank 3. I highly doubt that you can get banned for this. Don´t worry, dude.
---
We'll have to see if they learned their lesson and are making sure they're working on current builds when they patch. If they can manage that then maybe they'll finally start to catch up on all the biggest issues, the poor assaultron head will still never get patched though.
---
I'm level 20 and two separate level 100+ players have gifted me a combined 70+ Stimpacks, radaway, and purified water each.  I was flabbergasted.  
---
Glad I didnt waste any more points on that. I got the first level and was just gonna wait to swap it with the third and have that thinking I could unlock everything
---
No, you still have to have the quests complete.  
---
Dude on the left reminds me of Morgan wearing that kids tiny armor on The Walking Dead.
---
Or at least have craftable lock breaker tools 
---
The containers i looted patch day still have not refilled
---
My FPS seems to be getting worse the longer the game is out. I was trying to work my way through Eastern Penitentiary last night, only player in the building, and every single time I tried to turn to enter a cell or walk up set of double stares my game seemed to jump and completely disorient me to the point where I wasn't sure if I was facing the direction I meant. Seemed like the game couldn't handle the amount of super mutants I was fighting, they kept freezing and then launching forward.
---
Oh ok.
---
Good idea. It should be broken into separated weights for different categories or items.
---
I see that makes sense. I dont do supply drops very often just the ones I see at random.
---
No clue, looks pretty cool though. I once  traded with a guy who made a pretty sweet raider themed base there. 
---
There is a mod for that if you're playing on PC. And Bethesda liked a tweet where a guy was using it, so I guess it's okay to use it. Been using it for the majority of my gameplay. Perk Loadout Manager.
---
+int = +exp
---
Seems to be same on Xbox
---
The old phrase you’re looking for is “if it bleeds, it leads”. It applies to all mediums. People are sharks, and when they smell blood, they come to feed reflexively, without even thinking.
---
Most downvotes are done without even reading the post or understanding exactly what’s going on. They see some, they add one.
---
So what? That quest is easy as hell and takes no where as long as grinding the queen
---
Wow...totally false.
---
Some short sessions still flow well. Yesterday in about 90m of play I did Monongah and soloed Uranium Fever, all with my (now allegedly useless) 2-shot Gatling. Went home, made 5mm ammo, emptied the purifier and logged out.
---
I understand new content is coming soon but there are obviously still basic gameplay fixes they need to prioritize.
---
That's a wonderful idea.
---
You only got tagged as a duper if you take and keep ridiculous quantities of rare items.  Not if you just picked something up temporarily.
---
Is he running the park card that gives bonus xp if in a group. You can also run that to catch up if he isnt
---
Herbivore is clearly the superior choice for any gun build.  So many recipes that use meat are geared towards stats and bonuses that benefit melee builds.
---
Same. 
---
So you want everyone to have 1 gun an 1 set of armor? I'm pretty sure were supposed to collect different items as they have different effects for different purposes. 
---
On all guns? Jesus, I'm glad I read your comment. That could have been a pain in the ass down the road.
---
Try changing privacy settings in Xbox.  It seems fallout76 will block social teaming etc if your privacy settings are too high.  Even if you can play multiplayer on other games, it seems fallout76 may need additional "allowing" vs "blocking".  Worked for me after trying everything else!  Good luck!
---
The original Fallout game does not support 21:9. Steam and GoG version ship with a high resolution mod.
---
I ran into this as well, nothing I could do could get it to craft. 
---
tbh I still dont even have the lvl 3 lockpic card, idk why for some reason its just not there
---
Liars.
---
I would imagine so, but with how rare the “learn rate” or whatever it’s called with combat armor is, you’d have to go through a LOT of pieces. And with how Bethesda’s been mistaking people mass producing armor and weapons for dupers lately, trying to build a shit ton of combat armor to scrap is kinda out of the question... 
---
I mean the C in DLC is content...
---
With only 24 people per sever their should be no issues with stash limit increases. I don't code so I don't know for sure but it this day with tech it should be verily easy to do with only 24 people per server having larger size shouldn't hinder performance that much. 
---
No doubt. I need the motivation to level to 200. Lol Although I don't see the benefit to do it. Other than tracking down Unyielding armor pieces..Only need 2. 
---
On pc? Never had this happen but if you swap guns in the middle of reloading the dragon, when you swap back, sometimes it's reloaded.
---
I server hoped for almost 5 and never found it lol. Good luck my dude 
---
No! And it gets expensive to upgrade, I wouldn’t want scrap underarmor
---
No we don’t have any proof, he posted nothing from his experiment except words on a screen. 
---
Upgraded my Perception 3 extra levels JUST so I wouldn’t have to swap them out every time. So annoying.
---
Move camp cost still broken
---
Blinking indicator says costs 27 caps, then charges me 110 caps. Then my camp doesn't show up, so I fast travel away and back, still not there. Try again, placing camp a few paces away, cost is 27 caps, ends up charging me 110 caps again. Now I'm out 220 and the camp still doesn't load. This game finds new ways to disappoint me every time I play it. Thanks Bethesda
---
He's right belly of the beast is stupid easy. It's not our fault you dummies scrapped your shit. The res of us who wanted to be able to craft the set worked our asses off with SBQ events. And just because you all cried uhh we didn't know and lost it now they neggated all the work we did.
---
This is what I've managed to put together so far: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4a63f3&amp;d=s92se2ad2ak2al2a72ss2sg2ej4sf2cu2lc2am2p53eu0c71i12ee2&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4a63f3&amp;d=s92se2ad2ak2al2a72ss2sg2ej4sf2cu2lc2am2p53eu0c71i12ee2&amp;w=&amp;n=)

Read my comments.two relationships over 5 years. Don’t paint me with a brush please.
---
Some of the plans seem ridiculously priced at times... But good run
---
You get x01 plans from the enclave just how you get the ultracite plans from fort defiance. Unless you’re talking about the MOD plans. 
---
you can execute a downed player with cannibalism :)
---
I wish you good rolls, wanderer.
---
Only on guns that don't have different recievers. The 50 Cal seems to be the one most people have trouble with. 
---
Yes.   Servers are worse, FPS is worse, and client stability is worse.   
---
The patch introduced more bugs and the hot fix introduced even more 
---
Clown shoes
---
Have a SPECIAL requirement for the passive. Perception at 5? Level 1 locks. 10? Level 2. Same with hacking and intelligence. 
---
You people are delusional. 
---
But all melee weapons would be shit if they weren't balanced to be as effective or more effective then actual bullets. Should a boxing glove do 5 damage and a 50 cal instantly kill almost any creature?  Nobody would benifit from using melee
---
Thanks my man 
---
Rate of fire does not make up for it, sorry to break it to you. I play melee currently and have played heavy as well. 
---
Thank you so much for explaining this!
---
Right?! But really, what am I going to spend my money on. Not big into CAMP( My team has several). Next is the Longcoat. It's purty. Lol
---
Need to add something quick like the factions from Vegas or something....
---
Ooooooo drama, I don't know who to believe!
---
Because the last patch broke it.
---
No the ruptured ones. Only intact ones work for that.
---
If only there was some kind of perk that healed you from radiation...

If I had friends I would want them to avoid FO76. 
---
Seriously though,   I have experienced the same thing as the op.
---
Seriously? I write 5 paragraphs trying to give you a reasoned response about how the stash size isn’t currently a problem for everyone and you focus on half a line and dismiss it as "shouldn’t be a problem". Not really much of a discussion.
---
I've always found it odd that some perks tell you the % increase when you rank up and others just say low/medium/high chance. I like numbers.
---
Usually you can just scrap the base item for a chance to learn any mod for armor or weapons I know prime receivers are plan only. I was going to craft and scrap a bunch of basic ones I just didn't want to run through all of my plastic for nothing. Do you know if a vendor sells the mods for them?
---
I’ve had this happen multiple times. With the heavy combat chest, skull mask, camp stove, Ultracite Gatling laser, Ultracite welded rebar, plus a few more. 
---
I contacted Bethesda about it and got the same response everyone else does telling me to delete my local storage and load from the cloud...like seriously WTF?
---
It’s a known bug, there’s been nothing from Bethesda about fixing it. 
---
Good riddance to bad blood.
---
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
---
There’ll definitely at some point. There is evidence, dog helmets, inaccessible robot stations, and many more
---
Oh, ok. I am on xbox but thanks for the offer.
---
Thank you. So it isn't just me having this problem. Are bethesda aware that this was one of the things that was re-broke by the latest patch??
---
You have a positive opinion about the game?! Downvote!  /s
---
I don’t like the idea of transferring between accounts but I upvoted because if they do it this suggestion is perfect.
---
“I dont code” lol
---
Vendor in Grafton sells plans for all the Excavator Armor Mods.
---
What doesn’t cause server disconnects nowadays is the real question.   
---
Maybe I will after I successfully google how that is possible :)
---
Have a nice day
---
Im not talking about rifles here, vats crit makes them viable.
---
Please don’t tell anyone! &gt;_&lt;
---
Ok? Then don't reply. Didn't force you to write "5 paragraphs"
---
Great gun better with AA and Icr how much mine was doing westerns is where it is at when it comes to the revolvers though honestly cant tell why Bethesda felt we needed 3 of the same gun in game with different damages but the same fire rates....
---
It doesn't give anyone the "right" to abuse exploits.
---
It is unjustifiable.
---
congrats !
---
You again moron. Get a fucking life.
---
Why would you make that many anyways?
---
Lol fish lamp check for some reason clean water purifier check and then go to get me a 7000 dollar jet pack for a dying breed of power armor install check yeah...can I fix the claw machine I can make excavator armor so y can't I fix a Porta dinner lol?
---
Sighing at you right now. Will be deleting the comments.

---
Well, Sony isn't good at explaining. I received a warning for unacceptable sexual conduct. They couldn't tell me why, and I promise I'm a perfect gentlemen.
---
Cool. Sounds good!
---
How did you obtain the supplies to do so?
---
The dog helmets are equipped by attack dogs and may just be a bug. The robot stations are used for an enclave quest. I didn't know that for ages.
---
I really really would love the feature. The robot hacking seems kind boring without being able to to command or accompany the robot
---
You get a key sent to your other character and you have to find your suitcase among other players suitcases. It'll be more frustrating than the DMV quest
---
Would've done close to 500. My TSE lever done 780 with the right perks.
---
Get a fucking education. You don’t code, so how can you think what can/can’t be done? 
---
Come on mate.
---
Im sorry that perk card description are confusing. For me running is sprinting. And in a fallout game you never know. I recall Blitz in Fo4, with that perk you could teleport from like 10m away to an enemy. Not like the perks makes sense.
---
Im not lecturing anyone, i seriously want this to be fixed. The only thing i do is report my experience with the currently bugged sneaking mechanic :) 
---
This. Only 4:3 and it may have done 800x600 or 1024x768. The higher resolutions and ratios can cause issues in some areas like seeing places you shouldn’t. 
---
unless the devs answer with this, you arent anyone to give a final answer because you don't matter and aren't worth anything.

That's why it was necessary. It is unfortunate, but it became necessary for the reasons you stated.
---
I’d love the immersion of it.
---
Damn, I was late for story time
---
Okay, let’s get rid of the bias and talk about actual points
---
Why does cheating in one game lead to you getting banned from Morrwind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, NV, and 4? That is completely absurd why anyone would possibly think that is okay! And also, Bethesda has only put a bandaid on the problem at hand, which is cheaters. They’ve been band-aiding everything else in the game as well, PvP was a bandaid, clogging the holes that let the bugs in was just a bandaid (we saw how that one ended up), banning people who post bad things about Fallout 76 on their forums essentially creating a dictatorship, and not allowing refunds which is going to tuck them over. And lest not forget, they have more of a road map for micro transaction cosmetics in the ATOM shop than they do actual content, and gameplay, bug, and server crash fixes. To me, Fallout 76 is a game that has a lot of potential, but to me, something that has potential is just something that isn’t good enough or too lazy to become what it could be
---
There's a guy at my work who, instead of walking in to a room and talking to someone, just stands in the doorway and blocks it. I think of him as my work Fallout companion.
---
Yes.  And they took 2 days to issue a 'hotfix'.  That only fixed some of the most minor bugs reintroduced.
---
So it will be 'soon' that they'll get around to the next patch to re-fix the shit they had already fixed and then rebroke because no one seems to be doing version checking of merges over there.
---
You know they overwrote the red-lamp (for power armor) entry and turned it into an Atom Shop item accidentally?  So those that want to build it now or equip it can't.
---
S C R E A M I NG = T R I G G E R E D.
---
Who didn't know this? Dupers crying foul.. I didn't take the bait. Now Bethesda when we getting a new Favorite menu system and new endgame content 
---
I've been hopping for the first and last hour I play every day for a couple weeks and still nothing.
---
Got stacks of nuka quantum and enamel buckets though.
---
Also gotten about half a level (@6xp per time) picking that box on the far wall in the last room
---
Yeah, don't let them do it with something they can nerf, buff, or break in the future.....lol
---
Having Junk, Ammo, and Aid be weightless in the stash is a better option :)
---
T R I G G E R E D S T I L L
---
Just make a new email and make a new psn. 
---
Im a +100 and clothes are the only thing ive ever bought from the atoms shops
---
That and/or perk loadouts. Both would solve the issue.
---
I mean, GOG new Vegas ships with the 4gb patch (mod) pre installed, I'm willing to bet that the first Fallout game ships with a high resolution patch that the original didn't ship with
---
Y E S Y O U A R E

It's been happening. It is much worse when you try to open your Pip boy before the world is done loading.
---
My trick is to wait until I can switch and reload my weapons before trying the Pip boy.
---
Even if you can move, until you can switch and reload, opening the Pip boy has a chance to lock you up longer when this happens.
---
Abigale Poole: If you're fixin' to have a fit, best sit down before you bite your tongue clean off. Wouldn't want to ruin my carpet. It's all gonna be donated food, and we'll only keep the lights on for a couple hours. And if your sweet, I might even let you wear the Santa suit.
---
Tanner Holbrook: I. WILL. NEVER!!!
---
Abigale's accent makes this gold.  I wish they had done more with WVa accents
---
I’m not entirely sure what vendor sells what but yep you can find plans to upgrade each and every under armor from vendors. They will be called things like resistant protected and treated.
---
You will need to buy and learn each tier to be able to purchase the next tier and that vendor will continue to sell all the tiers. The only underarmor I don’t believe you can buy the plans for is the marine undersrmor which can be found in the world 
---
Proof?
---
Wait longer. Basic things like moving your camp are still broken (among countless other glitches and bugs). Says it costs 27 caps, then charges you 110 caps, and doesn't even load your camp. This happened to me twice today. Time to go back to overwatch for a few weeks and see if bethesda can make this game even minimally functional.  
---
hunting rifles, lever actions, and pump/double barrel shotguns 
---
" I can confirm that it isn't simply an omission because after equipping it my radiation resistance didn't go up at all."  
---
I wasn't clear but that is what I did when I said the above.
---
preach my man ! preach!
---
Lol your camp is literally next to mine. I'm in the stream just before it goes into that pond upstream
---
Ah I see, good to know, was this due to the recent patch I’m guessing?
---
I understand its what theyre comfortable with, but being unwilling to change engines is making them look like fools. I full heartedly believe the programmers truly love the series and want the best, but corporate is being cheap and lazy. Yes they're adding on to the engine and "making it work" but it doesnt work with this generation. As someone who's got tons of hours between 3, NV, and 4 you get used to the fact that its clunky and play a certain way. It's become unacceptable, it feels clunkier and slower than ever before.
---
Yep..that would be awesome roaming the wastes with a DC. Closest I can get to a companion is calling a an Enclave Vertibird. Lol
---
No offense guys.  But the idea that a ban in one game locks you out of your entire account is ridiculous.
---
Its even more ridiculous when that ban locks you out of purchasing anything else.
---
This isn't intended - this is just more incompetence on the part of Bethesda.
---
Don't get me wrong - I have no problems with banning people from FO76 for misbehavior.  But to also be banned from, say, FO4/3/Doom/etc for behavior in an unrelated game?  No, that's bullshit.  Utter bullshit.
---
"all I can say is we hear you*
---
Explosive is still king unless you're a VATS build, then +50% VATS crit is better.
---
Bloodied now has the highest potential damage buff of the primary effects, capping at 1.99x at low health.
---
I haven't seen anyone figure out the exact numbers but furious has a cap, and it's definitely less than 2x, so kinda whatever.
---
Anti-armor Sounds good but because of the super weird way damage resistance works it essentially just translates to dealing 20% more damage, regardless of the targets base resistance. TLDR: DR works as a ratio of resistance to armor, that then applies a scaling reduction to damage, applying a 0.5 multiplier to your targets armor just results in ~20% more damage. 
---
placing the blame on everyone but themselves
---
I have a pump but i doesnt do alot of damage so i stick to my armor piercing hunting rifle i got from an event
---
Uh huh. And how did you get enough springs to do that?
---
That does sound reasonable...
---
I seem to find alot of technical data in the level 3 locked stuff so I agree 
---
Your ideas are crap to me. I prefer the devs
---
If you do get stuck the map should still load and let you leave the server (useful if you are being attacked).
---
Since patch 5 it seems but it is intermittent. Many times I load into the server much faster than before, just when this delayed load happens opening the Pip boy is a kiss of ~~death~~ wait.
---
It’s ok, we can enjoy it together 
---
PS4 but thanks for the offer
---
No buffs. Only nerfs.
---
Melee. It's the best late game as well unfortunately. 
---
What des said, you don't know the rules. The pvp is lopsided for people attacking workshops. I don't kill lower level guys but if they like level 60+ they should know a little bit about the game. You might have had pacifist on too. I have guys shoot my base a lot and go wanted. If it was a honest mistake- I let them run around with their 5 bounty. I used to be real ruthless but found a lot of these guys just don't know what they're doing, they have pacifist off and shoot my base because it looks like it belongs there xD
---
Workshops put a target on your back. The event pops up for everyone on the map to see and it draws in the bag thieves. Like desemos said it's actually pretty good payout cause a lot of them are clueless.
---
Well that's good 
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info, much appreciated.
---
If you find weapons you aren’t gonna use, scrap them for mods. Mods will greatly improve the weapon. And as you do more quests you’ll be rewarded with some good stuff 
---
My bad!! I fixed it. Lol. Thanks. 
---
I want the rocket powered sledgehammer, i have a base one and it 1 shots most things my lvl
---
Hunting rifles and shotguns are the best early on and the easiest to find and learn mods for; you'll also find plenty of armor for both. Lever actions are excellent but much harder to get, and ammo is not as plentiful.
---
That would be nuts!  If only there was some way for them to test it before going live.  Sadly, not sarcasm.
---
YOU GUYS!  YOU GUYS!
---
I was just screwing around, trying to see what's at the bottom of these fissures and you won't believe what I found!
---
Seriously OP - consider it like the gypsy curse in Thinner.  The only way to get rid of it is to give it to someone else.
---
Hot potato hot potato
---
I usually drop things off at the medical container just.outside flatwoods
---
I think the perk card system needs to go, tbh. It's confusing and tedious 
---
Im on xbox
---
Pretty unneeded though. Sure if you’re new to going this may be scary but if you’ve been gaming awhile, this happened every time. A new game comes out and then people get mad for cheating and then they make up an excuse and lie to make the company look bad. 
---
Are you sure? proof?
---
Who knows, really. There is so much misinformation here that any claim by a player should be treated with extreme scrutiny. Sadly, Bethesda's word is also tenuous given amount of errors they have made with the game (if they can accidentally revert portions of a patch they could certainly accidentally ban the wrong people.) The only things we can know with absolute certainty is what we personally experience playing the game.
---
If people who picked up massive amounts of duped items do get caught in the ban net we can only hope that Bethesda's appeal process is worth a shit and that they will investigate and revert any wrongful bans. What else can we do?
---
Should of used "people be like:" instead
---
FO76 doesnt like me I'm convinced.
---
Ok? I’m level 98 and mostly got emotes from the atom shop, I still would like future updates to add more stuff to spawn pools in game instead of only through the atom shop. 
---
X01 mod plans aren’t in the game at the moment. Possibly will be eventually.
---
because Bethesda pulled the posts ! lol just kidding . bethesda was telling some outrageous lies today . so i thought id add in 
---
Todd Howard here, we understand your frustration at the lack of progression that you have experienced in game. We at Bethesda have always strived to balance enjoyable gameplay with ample rewards. And while it is no conciliation we would like to recommend the purchase one of the atomic shop item Unstoppable! character costumes, for only 800 you too can feel like a super hero in the wasteland of West Virginia.
---
Did you have any diseases at the time?  Or had you cured any diseases that play session?
---
No stats show in the effects tab. Rad worms healed on its own. Cant sprint jump. 
---
Oh really? See? Bethesda hates me
---
Yeah. Not like a tse shotgun is still one of the most op guns in the game or anything.
---
im keeping my ban appeal open to show proof to the community that this is BS
---
Well if you have a camp in the mire they will attack it occasionally. I have mine there and sometimes one will be sitting in my camp when i fast travel to it.

If you reread my post, it was at my C.A.M.P. this happened. I know you can get killed at a workshop really easily, which is why I TP anytime I see a +40 lvl coming to a workshop. I was sitting in my base crafting when I was one tapped. I see now other comments mention a workshop, but idk where they got that from.
---
Are you running in full screen? This game pretty much has to be run in full screen or else it stutters and lags pretty badly.
---
Because why should I waste time to reload? It's nearly broken after I shot the whole drum magazine anyway. Just drop it &amp; grab next Handmade.
---
I hear you.  Really hoping they implement it so that we can display our power armor like in Fallout 4, a la Tony Stark's basement.  Although I dont know if the servers can handle people potentially setting up big power armor galleries?  Guess we can only hope and see.
---
I collected this "data" over several sessions. I surely had diseases some time. 
---
It is possible. But I already got downvoted for saying how. 
---
Ah, that's too bad. I'm on PS4.
---
It's a joke . . . 
---
Oh yeah its in full screen.
---
Marvellous. I have defended this game so much. Really starting to lose hope they'll ever get it right.
---
Wish the outer worlds was out. Would happily play that right now
---
Seeing places you shouldn't, it has to zoom out further and further which can make it hard to see and click on gameworld objects and it wasn't that long ago it had a broken UI they fixed.
---
Dunno if you're on PC but there's a mod for that
---
It's just a pump - I know all the mods, I just have to go down to the Cranberry Bog and kill scorched until I get one.
---
Picked up a bunch of duped loot did ya?
---
If it is a shot down random cargo drone it will also say "Steal" but it wont give a bounty, it will just activate the self destruct on the container (60 sec countdown or something like that roughly). She might have just pointed you to good loot and a potential Nuclear Keycard. 
---
And when people were stacking Bobbleheads to do well over a million damage?  Let’s do the math together...
---
Don’t put your full trust into anyone unless you want to get burned. Keep in mind, however, that cheaters often lie when they get caught.
---
You’re the real MVP.

If you’re still online. I will gladly take them off you, so I can then give them back to another person when I am finished too.

A kid will see worse on other parts of the internet or at a friends house. Sensoring entertainment solves nothing really unless theres a learning disability and the kid cant differentiate reality from fantasy

GoG and Steam version ships with the high resolution mod
---
I have played many of them. I base my opinion on what I enjoy now. Not what I’ve enjoyed previously. 
---
I used the BOS recon rifle that I crafted. It’s a level 1 lol.
---
Sure they do and companies often twist the truth to cover up things that may cost them business/customers.
---
It’s in the code though. There are many robot stations around, in the airport, some places at the mire etc and there was stations in fo4, so it’s very plausible.  I don’t think there will be human companions though. But I won’t be surprised for robots or dogs. 
---
PSN chaoscythe
---
It is definitely there, have met several wearing it
---
What platform you on? I got an extra
---
Did you use any stash exploits to make the cap go beyond 600 , I’ve seen exploiters do that and it leads to the stash being counted as storage iirc 
---
I ask because I believe this bug to correlate to curing Rad Worms.
---
I’ve created a separate thread to get specific information on it, if interested in sharing any info you get in the future:
---
Same for me. It seems they broke something with the distance enemies can detect you at. Counts as 'in combat' when you're in caution, so regenerating armor doesn't work. Ugh.
---
Todd Howard here, We here at Bethesda noticed an alarming trend in player retention, in order to correct this trend we have implemented a soft cap to the player count on all servers with the latest patch. We hope you enjoy this new feature as well as our commitment to player satisfaction.
---
They will. They have squashed many bugs. They messed up one patch and you all are being the biggest babies about it. Otherwise. The bug fixes have consistently improved the game. 
---
\^This.  I use the same mod.  It has made the game dramatically less tedious for me.  It's an easy mod to implement and doesn't change the game too much to make Bethesda flag it.  
---
Seriously, they need to just patch this "Perk Loadout / Deck swapper" in.  Being able swap my decks on the fly has been a godsend for me and made me enjoy the game a LOT more.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aktctr/more_information_on_arenanets_mistake_in_april/

Leaving this here for the sheep quick to defend Bethesda.
---
I still have met nil, likely places of finding one? 
---
I’ve searched everywhere 
---
Including looking for the far southern swamp marine team in the apc
---
Nada. 
---
I’m pretty sure that you were murdered for being around the workshop while it’s being claimed. During the process it activates PVP I believe. 
---
I love how 99% of people were excited about being able to change your build at any time, now everyone wants half the perks to be passive. Bethesda doesn't even need to do anything for people to dislike the game even more. lmao
---
Oh rip. That sucks.
---
The guy wasn’t taking any chances.

Xbox

---
Really? Ty 🙏🏾
---
100% with you on this. I can deal with bugs even when they're frustrating, but what am I putting up with those bugs \*for\*? CONTENT.
---
Given how easy it is to have a "mule character" that any two friends can use to ferry items back and forth anyway, I can't see that including a feature like this would be especially game-breaking, especially with the tidy little weight limit you suggest. 
---
Though I suppose I could see people using this to create extra storage for themselves, creating multiple characters and sending them each 75 lbs each. Perhaps place a limit of one "in process" delivery per character at a time. 
---
Lol you’re so mad. You didn’t have to worry about it because it was blatantly bullshit. Anyone with an ounce of common sense could see that. Look at your little insults. Oh my. 
---
This game is perfect for kids.
---
Kids used to work in coal mines
---
FO76 takes place in W. Virginia
---
What’s is W. Virginia? Yes, coal mines.
---
Let the kids play!!!
---
Is there any simple way to transfer things to a 2nd char on the same account?
---
&gt; Called it
---
I bet you would've "Called it" when Arenanet swore up and down their cheat detection methods were flawless and their bans were just right?
---
Is it some kind of quest? Where did you find this note?
---
Like the other guy said when you claim or try to claim a workshop owned by somebody else that is not a team mate it marks you both hostile and you can shoot at will. It does not matter if you have pacifist enabled or not. 
---
On xbox1 pup boy still freezes the game when opened upon spawn in. 
---
AA?
---
Ive had Rad Worms and my buffs went up. AGI with marsupial went up to 6 instead of 4. Carry weight uped from 20 to 30.
---
Scaly skin resistance went up too.
---
Sometimes the positive effects goes down. I couldnt jump as high as i could before. Gotta server hop to fix it.
---
I couldnt correlate Rad Worms to buggy sneak mechanics tho. 
---
As long as you have a friend :p
---
in reality the queens loot table is shared and the corpse isnt turning into a meat pile its just dissapearing because everyone else has grabbed all the loot and its empty now
---
Ouch, glad that it got changed then, that would’ve taken a lot of fun out of the game. 
---
sure I will trade them for other ammo types :)
---
You're definitely not the minority.  The challenges of developing an online game is that the players are absolutely ravenous when it comes to content, and I am hoping Bethesda will continue to develop more with this game.  It has only been something like 80 days since launch I think, so I will just wait patiently.
---
Pretty sure it's called Advanced power connectors and it's at Harper's ferry
---
There is no 'No PvP' mode. Pacifist mode clearly states that you can be attacked. Just because you're a pacifist, doesn't mean others won't kill you. History has enough examples. 
---
You can't use fists/death tambos/gauntlets in power armor. You can add things like rusty knuckles and such to your power armor though.
---
I forget where but there is a royal jelly somewhere that can be picked up that counts as an aid item. Maybe the Halloween store? I remember it was in a basket. 
---
Anti-Armor :) I have versions of both but I prefer my AA
---
Westek has a few microscopes. The trader at watoga has one on the shelf behind him. Grahm sells bulk fiber optics. The best place is silos, you get a lot of bio scanners off the robots there.
---
This has to be satire, nobody is this stupid 
---
Aaaaah thx
---
if only radiation didn't eat away at your max health...
---
Was playing last night. I'm only a level 6. Right after I made it to the first town (Flatwoods?) a player messaged me via XBox Live, and said he wanted to hook me up. Dropped a ton of plans, some purified water, and some stimpaks. Then he helped me clear out the Farmhand building. 
---
After doing the first batch of volunteer missions, I went back to the Overseers CAMP to craft level 5 armor. When I was there, another user dropped another bunch of plans, some ammo and other aid items. 
---
Love the community, even if the game isn't exactly what I'd hoped for. 
---
Bethesda has admitted mistakes before. They have no reason whatsoever to ban legitimate players. Hate or love Bethesda all it takes is a lot common sense to realize the ban claims are bullshit. 
---
Np your welcome 😆
---
What types?
---
How cheap? Looking to build the x-01 jet pack and decontamination shower 
---
I think the majority of the time it was a problem with the UI.  If someone’s trying to sell/offer multiple items while the other person is accepting them, it moves everything on the list up one slot.  Someone in a hurry (or experiencing some lag even) won’t realize they’re offering the item one spot below what they _intended_ to offer, then much later see they’re missing a good gun or armor piece or serum and think it was somehow taken.
---
I’ve “caught” myself “stealing” from my wife’s character and vice-versa, after looking through both our inventories to find the mysteriously missing item.
---
Ouch indeed! Especially when you fall in a ditch at Cranberry Bog and blow yourself up like some kind of gory confetti!! 
---
#BETHESDA this is a ***really*** good idea! Please have a look
---
Maybe then they should've delayed the game instead of just releasing it as 60$ AAA game? Sorry but they sold their game and that's when people form their opinions and as it turned out the opinion due to the extreme bugs and otherwise stupid gameplay decisions that those opinions were largely negative. Them saying it's an "experiment" will only fool the most dense people out there that are fine with getting served an alpha state game for 60$.
---
If it takes another 6-8 months to reach a "release ready" state then sorry but they should've outright delayed the game period. But sadly enough the prospect of the christmas sales period was to strong and Bethesda caved under the prospect of money over an actually working game.
---
I still have stuff to get, but agree it is getting a little stale. Not interested in survival mode so not much to look forward too in the nearest future. 
---
Hahaha 
---
I heard the change was deliberate and pretty much bought it
---
IF you own a workshop somebody can claim it then teleport to your CAMP (they can see where you are on the map) then kill you. I've given you some ideas to have some better defenses if you want to do that.
---
Looks like it should be a popular place
---
Daaaaaamn, any chamce you got one more? 1k caps? :P
---
This post is bad . and you should feel bad .
---
I stopped switching to them 1 month ago. Never got anything good in the safes anyways. 
---
My buddy keeps 1 loaded for the whitesprings pool house though for the extra legendary ghoul though.
---
well im using mode for pc, and rly 2 isnt enoght. i have shotgun, melee, heavy guns, crafting, carry weight lay outs. so 5 is enought.
---
You are definitely the minority. The majority of people that have played F76 have not run out of content in 80 days. 
---
Oooo self indulgent hate is such a good way to describe their rage masturbation. 
---
So if you commit a serious crime in one state or country,  you shouldn't be held accountable in any other states or countries because you didnt commit the crime their?  
---
It's almost like Bethesda is treating it like a real crime and holding people accountable for it with a legit punishment .
---
Why would Bethesda want known ' criminals ' in their other games?  
---
&gt;hypothesis
---
It's a  hypothesis  not a theory, and it's based off nearly 2 decade of being a paid beta tester. 
---
Simply put, the people with more problems have some hardware difference far enough away from the Dev/testing pc that bgs used to make the game. Something that make it some erroneous code to mess come apparent,  Something they can't test for Because they don't have that hardware to test on. 
---
you have a nice system there too :)
---
I need lot of info before I even make it as theory lol. Thanks you for your specs.  \^\_\^ 
---
That is the perk Inspirational. 
---
thank you. :)
---
i agree no ban yet from crafting a lot, but the server does lag and become non responsive so shrug
---
PC? I want to go there!
---
We thought that might be the case too, but just couldn't find anything about it. 
---
I think we would have had it by now BUT the duping and server instability as a result probably threw a monkey wrench into their plans to do so.
---
Just my hunch.
---
That did it in mine too so I scrapped it. It’s really annoying. 
---
I had the exact same issue with a high end PC with a 1080ti.    I have an easy fix that solved my issue.
---
Challenges are broken all around the board, not surprised at all.
---
That may be the case and I do have it installed but even then we shouldn't have to rely on mods to make an online game better. This should have been a feature at launch, however I am grateful this mod is a thing. I have a ton of mods just for QoL.
---
Yes!! That is so weird, I said this the other day. I thought it would be cool to be able to send 'parcels' or 'packages' to someone on your friend's list so you don't have to wait until they log in to trade. I thought it would be cool to have a Mr. Handy Mailman that goes around or spawns when you log in and delivers a parcel to your camp.
---
Thanks, Todd. It's very good.
---
&gt;So if you commit a serious crime in one state or country, you shouldn't be held accountable in any other states or countries because you didnt commit the crime their? 
---
No.  You shouldn't.
---
And aren't.  
---
I mean, that's how 'jurisdiction' works.  I commit a crime in Mexico, I am not prosecuted in America.  If I'm in American and do something that would be illegal in Saudi Arabia, I am not prosecuted by either the US nor Saudi Arabia.
---
Because that would be bullshit.
---
They add bugs in every patch, e.g The trade slider bug.  That was before patch 5.  They have yet to tackle bigger bugs like renaming power armor, SBQ flying off and many more.  INstead they have added a bigger grind.  How about the new patch where cap containers have bugged out so the perk card doesn't work consistently?  How about the stats you have bugging out so much its a dice roll on what you are going to get.
---
You will see the incompetence eventually.  Might take another 3 months but you will.
---
I have scaly skin, adrenal reaction, speed demon and marsupial. All of their positives and negatives were increased by 50% Marsupial did something interesting. Once cured of radworms and after doing a few super jumps my jumping went to 50% less than normal. It was as if I jumped too high for the game to handle. All other mutations carried on with the 50% increase after the rad worms were gone. Logging in and out reset the whole thing. 
---
Democracy is non-negotiable!
---
I can see that. I just don’t care that much. I have bigger priorities in my life than to throw a fit about a video game and try to make everyone else as miserable as me. 
---
Well if dupers stop then it should help free up some space.
---
Guess you’re a plumber now.
---
Right? I‘m so sick of this shit...
---
You have one of those mad Samsung "As long as your house and as curved as your weird cousin" monitors? :)
---
How is it for gaming??
---
Pistols are simply too weak to be viable past level 10 or 15; rifles are better for ranged attacks. Unarmed (fists/gauntlets/etc) is better but you'll need very high strength and endurance, and good armor.
---
I'm personally pretty fond of the death tambo for that 'up close and personal' touch. It's a pocket weapon for me though; I mainly do rifles, and I carry about 5 different ones. Each has its strengths and weaknesses.
---
Yes, PC. Across from the Charleston Station. It popped up a few times while I was trying to spawn the Charleston Vendor Bot.
---
The one shotting is ridiculous,  PvP or not. I'm For nerfing everything 
---
It’s amplifying positive effects when you have the disease and negative effects are being amplified when it is cured.
---
It suggests to me that it’s been miscoded to increase the magnitude of effects by 50% and to reset to normal upon cure and then reset your effects, and subtract 50% from your original base amount. 
---
Example:
---
- Base = 100 health 
---
- Hypothetical Effect = +50 health 
---
- Rad Worms Bugged Effect = +75 health 
---
- Rad Worms Cured
---
- Rad Worms Post Cure Bugged Effect = 50 health subtracted from base OR 75 health subtracted from base
---
- Post-Cure Bugged Base = 50 or 25 (only one of these will be true, need experimentation)
---
- I don’t have the numbers yet to see if the post cure totals are - base effects or - bugged effects.
---
- In sum, having Rad Worms for now is a huge perk initially (+However, once cured, it becomes a huge negative.
---
If commit a serious crime in Mexico are prosecuted for it and now have a criminal record ... you aren't fucking allowed into America and vice versa .
---
"its'a me , Mario ! my princess is in another vault ! "

Well that's great. If your willing to share, even better.

I just wanted to say that I am really impressed that Todd “it just works” Howard is taking time the time to directly respond to customer issues.   
---
Dude, you rock.
---
My kind of CAMP. 
---
Todd Howard here, we here at Bethesda are saddened by your allegations of the company covering up censorship and misinformation. We intend to dispel the notion of twisting the truth, instead we want to commit fully to censoring all criticism and as well any support tickets made public. We feel that criticism has no place in the enjoyment of the atomic shop by our player base.
---
A good way that I found is to get even more radiation until you mutate again, then take a radaway and it will only take away the most recent mutation that you got.
---
&gt;t your full trust into anyone unless you want to get burned. Keep in mind, however, that cheaters often lie when they get caught.
---
They do, but companies like Bethesda also lie about there products, the products abilities and there behind the scene practices....pretty sure Bethesda have been caught out once or twice in the past as well tbh.
---
From YOUR information (and thank you), it appears as though base -50% after cure is the correct number (at least for marsupial)
---
I thought I was crazy when the skeleton mask plans failed to appear in my crafting menu - at least it wasn't my imagination.
---
Possibly fists/rifles then?  
---
I definitely want fists no matter what, ranged weapon can change I guess
---
Yuppers.  
---
I've tried to obtain a nice mix but ended up with Empath, this is the only one so far I cannot get rid of with Radaway, all the others come and go Empath seems to stick, it is probably coded this way, seems odd but for the game being aimed at teams and power armor end game play style, so it probably is weighted to get quick loose slow?? No idea.
---
If you’re on Xbox I will well you one for cheap

Grape Nuka cola

Embrace democracy or you will be eradicated!
---
If only there were other perks that cured radiation, and items one could use to reduce the amount of radiation intake, and to cure said radiation, that were ubiquitous 
---
Agree. There have been some grumblings on this sub that it's rude not to take the invite because people want a travel discount  (◔\_◔)
---
Is there a good place to get that?  I dont think I have ever seen grape
---
Thanks for the post!
---
They still fix more than they break. Several extremely game breaking bugs have been dealt with. Remaining power armor isn’t a bug. The queen will eventually be fixed. They already made her land more.
---
The rest is stuff that’ll be ironed out over time. I can still log in and play for a couple of hours without any major problems. Stop acting like it’s the end of the world and unplayable. 
---
I see the issues. You’re not some genius that can see what others can’t. I just don’t really care that much. 
---
It’s a great idea that would ease up on the grind ; therefore , they won’t do it. 
---
That’s good to hear!
---
Bar upper-level whitespring resort
---
Hahahahahahahah I love this 
---
awwwww
---
Borderlands 2 does the exact same thing, and it really helps with boosting your alts. (That is if you happen to find something you want to use for leveling.) Also Path of Exile's stash is account wide so any character can use anything inside, given they're the correct level of course.
---
We appreciate your feedback and would like to know how we can improve the atomic shop in the future.
---
Bubbles in Whitesprings sells it. 
---
Regardless if Steam/GoG modded Fallout to support the resolution AND the aspect ratio **or** modders added aspect ratio support to both Fallout 4 and 76, Bethesda needs to fix this junk so that it support the resolution AND aspect ratio natively. Steam and GoG added it to improve our QoL, but Bethesda doesn't seem to give a shit.
---
Really, I mean the plastic lost before I realized what was happening xD
---
How much are they 
---
Yeah, I think that would work fairly well. I'd say focus your perks on strength and unarmed damage first. Hunting rifles are reasonably good even without perks at lower levels.
---
Underappreciated post of the day... points for you!
---
There isn’t a No PVP mode. Just “Pacifist” which means they can hurt you but you can’t hurt them.  Pacifist is good for not accidentally shooting other players so you don’t accidentally initiate PVP. But don’t use it when defending a workshop you claimed.
---
I was going to go to a silo to use the decontamination showers... do those cure mutations too?  Or just the rads?
---
COMMUNISM is the very definition of *FAILURE*
---
Starched Genes perk card is a must for mutations. As long as it is level 2 and equipped, you can use radaway and it won;t remove the mutation. It also blocks new mutations, so if you are trying to get more than one, you have to remember to unequip it.
---
Nah. The playerbase has been steadily dwindling. 
---
Limuted "Dark as a Dungeon" Edition!
---
This happened with my two shot black powder, all 27 rounds were available for immediate firing. Mutants at West-Tek didn't know what hit em. The bug was maintained through multiple restarts &amp; logins. Don't have any quad weapons myself so I don't think it's a transfer of that legendary effect (plus, 27 rounds etc).

---
What about: If you own the card you can unlock the difficulty. If you have the card equipped you get an extra bonus that makes the minigame easier or gives you another small bonus for this activity.
---
ofc, why make new stuff when they can re skin the old stuff :/
---
Its is Bethesda's No1 trick isn't it? 
---
Sneak was 100% broken by last patch. You know what you did Bethesda. Revert please. 
---
After we killed the SQB for the 58th time and began a new game type we invented called 'Domination', the game is still rather fun. My raider friends and I attempt to lockdown and capture every public workshop and slay any who oppose us, regardless of level. We die, they die, etc. We are just bored and tired of bullet sponge scorchbeasts. At least our fellow players put up an original fight every time. Wait... Isn't that the same entertainment value as Battlefield?
---
And yet here you are, trying to influence others with your opinion. 
---
Literally the only time I use lvl 3 hacking and lockpick is when I'm doing nuke silos 
---
Couldn't agree more. The reason I love the other fallout games is I can play forever and still have something to do. I still play FO76 pretty much everyday but it's only for about 30 mins max before I run out of my "daily" stuff that I do. I dont have anyone to play with really but even if I did what is there to do? Launch a nuke for the hundredth time or do the same events? I liked being able to have long quests etc so when I logged off and came back on I could pick up where I left off. I find myself struggling to do things. Theres a challenge to play 7600 hours but theres not even close to enough things to do for that long.
---
Ok, HOW CAN WE ALL GET THIS?! C'mon Bethesda, we want Excavator paint jobs... 
---
It used to be worse. I don't know what the hell Bethesda was thinking with that damn toxin. 
---
Furthermore that isn't exactly how jurisdiction works.  You can still be held accountable,  it's just possibly the other state or country that is going to prosecute you . 
---
Like damn if you think that's how it works , go murder someone in suadi Arabia or china and see if you get off Scott free cause your American.  Lol. 
---
You don't get free reign to commit crimes in places because you just left them for some other place. 
---
Damn but the dueling system worked well at least you couldnt run away and your opponent was withing line of signt all the time 
---
But some random internet person is totally believable? 
---
If only the perk to cure radiation effected yourself instead of others, if only we had an infinite supply of the radiation curing item that way they wouldn't get used up as fast as stimpak with that build...
---
Am I the only one not seeing that this would just make you short on radaway instead of stimpaks
---
Might have already unlocked it and stashed some stuff inside it?
---
Maybe it's just me but I just never swap my cards. I accept that it's a trade off in building my character and I just never want to deal with it when my head is in the game. My build is pretty utilitarian and I use lots of hits to kill stuff because my melee and shotgun perks aren't fully maxed, but I think that makes it more exciting tbh. 
---
I clicked on it just as it got [deleted] 😂
---
Its not. I agree. Still called it.
---
We at Bethesda realize that costumer engagement is needed to improve the atomic shop experience.
---
&gt; I've been grinding since day one and never seen a TSE anything.
---
Me too. And I don't always play solo. I very often play in teams. Neither me nor my team mates have found one.  And yes, we have dropped a nuke one white springs and farmed it for several hours causing hundreds of glowing ghouls to respawn by jumping in and out of the server. 
---
Have you tried this mod?
---
I have four different sets of perks. One for rifles, one for unarmed low-life, one for power armor, and another one for crafting.  
---
Switching with one button in perks menu, plus you can give a name to each set and show it on the screen.
---
I am surprised that such an important and cool feature has not yet been implemented in the game.
---
Never said it hasn’t  but it can dwindle for various reasons. A franchise as popular as Fallout is going to have a lot of people check it out early put it some time and move on. It is inevitable. To think that the reason the majority of people are leaving is because they have treated the game like a part time job and have run out of things to do is asinine. 
---
like 30 caps I think. 
---
Will you join my team?........ awaiting response 
---
Sure would be nice if we had something like, oh idk, a text chat feature where we could just say ‘no thanks’ or ask first ‘wanna team up’? Just a thought ... |:
---
Its a known issue....with Bethesda support, they are clueless :/
---
Pretty sure the 10% stored is a known issue as well though tbh. Checked your blueprints?
---
Game has been out 3 months. Give it time
---
They do! Make sure you have starched genes perk on and it won’t! 
---
This is a nonissue. First, how many people are actually finding these bags? Secondly, one the dupers lower their inventories to move again, there will be fewer and fewer bag dumps to find. Lastly, if you are worried, don't pick the stuff up.
---
"Edit: give attention pls"
---
What I find odd is that this area of the game mechanics wasn't even mentioned in the patch notes. None of the fixes or nerfs should be touching this code.
---
Haven't seen that one. I'll be sure to take a look!
---
In one of the terminals it explains this with scorched, it's a hive mind like the borg in ways. But mutants, yeah I don't know why they can see. They have reduced perception though from what I've seen.
---
Kind ironic that the calls for removal of PVP are getting stronger and louder etc and Bethesda is busy working away on a new PVP exclusive mode, whilst not removing it from the old servers :/
---
Could they get any further away from their customers?
---
Really simple solution would be creating load outs. Set up one load out with your adventuring / cards and set up another load out with your crafting / cards.
---
I've never slapped a silverback gorilla in the face. Phew, glad to get this off my chest.
---
This guy should be hired by Bethesda 
---
Yea but hits like go through her now, as if she’s not there
---
Works as intended. -Bethesda 
---
nope, just saying the opinion of some nobody doesn't mean anything or have value. So pretending or saying shit like final word is just silly because no one gives a fuck what you think and it just shows how delusional of an individual one must be to think anyone gives a shit about your opinion as a final word for anything. 
---
I do not think so but I could be wrong. No one has ever destroyed any of mine and I have not been able to destroy one either. If you have a chance please try to destroy one and let us know what you find out. I will keep experimenting as well.
---
I am sure a Nuke would kill me in my camp and probably some of the other radiation weapons because I think radiation damage goes through floors but does not destroy them. I do not know if a nuke would do physical damage to the other objects inside my structure though (like crafting stations and generators).
---
Nukes would be flying towards Bethesda studios instead of the Cram Bog
---
You were just hoping I'd ask...
---
Well, back the the Mojave i go. It just works. Like it should.
---
If only there was an arch that could be built, that freely cured radiation, or locations like Blackwater Mine, one could travel to and have said radiation removed completely.
---
Edited with photos.
---
How common is that in reality, though? I know a few people on here have posted stories, but we all know how reliable those are.  I disagree that they are just as guilty, but I also don't think it's an issue large enough to have any meaningful impact. 
---
I absolutely loved the DMV quest. It was spot on to authenticity of a real life visit.
---
That first photo is fantastic. Well done. Thanks for sharing!
---
Just randomly laying around. 
---
That’s okay to want something better, especially since it’s something that could benefit us all. I dig it.
---
Probably just has to wait for the appeal response I agree it's ridiculous that they decided to ban people from all Bethesda games . This would mean if you purchased content from say the creation club or atom supports all gone with the account. 
---
Why did you PM me yourpenis?
---
Add 70%+ damage and u will get your answer
---
Just before you buy it, you can see what lvl you are, let’s say youvare buying the amnosmith lvl 1 it will say uou have 1, if you click on it to buy it, it will go full screen snd there you can see you are max lvl.
---
Unfortunalely at the moment you need a friend to transfer between different characters. You give the stuff to them, log into your second character and they give stuff back.
---
Mine never did above 250 dmg with all perks equipped. So I don't know how people were getting it are saying 700 +.
---
Full wipe? At level 120? No thanks I'll just take my refund
---
The thing though is part of that is adding artificial limits to make the card useful but hampers the actual gameplay of the end user.  
---
I've seen that there is at least in Huntersville quest a Perception check.  I would vote to make these passive skills that just check against what points you have in what special
---
You can buy them. From bos bot in sativa.
---
I haven’t killed the SBQ without freezing.
---
Or ya know, just use a console if you wanna sit on the couch and play...you’re right, not complicated AT ALL? 
---
Harper's Ferry for me, about 1800 with no perks or CHA+ chems.  Paid about 1600 with Grace Mentats, Hard Bargain 2, Vodka.
---
Sorry about all the troll replies :\ You might also want to look into your internet connection, could be you're lagging badly in game and it's causing stuttering and other things that might seem/feel like FPS issues, I know when my internet starts acting up the game starts running like garbage, also make your video drivers are up to date and that Fallout 76 is using your default GPU and not something else
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noRWPsBX88A
---
For whatever reason for some people the game defaults to either the onboard GPU or some kind of odd secondary phantom GPU that's running at like 50% power.
---
Same with one of my two legendary 10mm pistols on PS4. It's always the same one, too.
---
It sucks real bad.  It is also a great challenge in a less than challenging end-game.
---
I agree with 95% of what you're saying.  I have a totally separate "battle danger" perk loadout that I use for nukes and when I choose to take on a particularly heavy enemy, like a scorchbeast.  It sacrifices stealth for defense, because I know for sure I have virtually no chance of staying hidden.
---
Although I agree that having one enemy detect you shouldn't set the entire instanced mob on your ass, it didn't really work like that until this latest patch interfered with something.  I'm sure you're using suppressed weapons and shadowed/muffled armor, and using shadows really helps for avoiding an unwanted scorchbeast confrontation.  Even in a close quarters interior, I found that killing the offender(s) that had me in \[danger\] would put me back into \[  caution  \].  I could retreat and reposition from a different vantage while they were all crowding around my previous location trying to find me.  It's really a shame that the mine timer seems to be extra slow in 76, because I used to use plasma and bottlecap mines all the time in Fo4 to trap chokepoints and doorways to kill or soften up enemies.  When I first started playing 76, I tried to use mines but cautioned enemies usually manage to walk clear of the blast radius by the time the mine explodes.  Either that or the mine disappears after a certain amount of time.  It's not the biggest loss, but I actually used to keep a handful of mines on hand in Fo4.  Now I don't even bother picking them up because they're not even worth the cost/weight ratio for vendoring.
---
As far as mole rats, radscorpions and other burrowing critters, I assumed they had very sensitive noise detection.  Muffled leg pieces help tremendously, and if possible, choosing a sniping spot that's off the bare ground and up a staircase is ideal, like a sentry post.  They'll pop up and try to get at you via the stairs, where you can take them out with quick VATS targeting.  Of course that's ideal circumstances, and I always carry a backup light melee weapon, like a combat knife or reduced weight legendary melee for dealing with molerats.  I just get out of sneak mode with radscorps so I can move a bit quicker and try to kite them around while hipfiring at them with a close quarters, fast firing rifle like a combat rifle or handmade kitted out with hipfire accuracy mods.
---
I completely agree that scorchbeasts have an absurdly high detection stat.  I've even gotten caught while using a stealth boy and an AG stat in the mid to high 20's.  I've just assumed that there was some kind of "hive mind" going on, so it never really bothered me that all scorched minions immediately locked on and swarmed me.  Again, this is where a rapid fire close range rifle is useful.  My bolt action scoped rifle does like 2-3x the damage as my handmade, but the hipfire accuracy and fire rate are abysmal.  I also use five ranks of Adrenaline perk (agility) and take out the Scorched before putting focus back on the scorchbeast.  One, taking out the minions causes her to land, and two I have +60% damage to light her up with hipfire shots.  I also dump all weight saving perks for additional defense when I'm doing SBQ.  A couple ranks in Barbarian (str) and white knight (end) help, especially when you're in a hazmat suit.  
---
I swap out Mister Sandman, Covert Operative and Sneak for 3 ranks of Evasive, 3 ranks of White Knight , 3 ranks of Dodgy (I don't use VATS too often and am usually standing still most of the time so AP is an unused resource in a fight) and 2 ranks of Born Survivor during a blast.  I use my 5 str for 3 ranks of blocker and 2 Barbarian.  2 Ed for 2 ranks of Ironclad.  Of course I like the sneak bonuses, but during a blast there's so many enemies at either SBQ or Whitesprings golf club that staying in stealth is very difficult or impossible if you want to be active in the fight.  2x SA damage is still nice when you can get it.  An investment of 6 perks for better stealth and an additional 50% SA damage isn't as valuable as damage mitigation when you know you're going to get spotted and swarmed by ghouls in a matter of seconds.  (wendigo also seem to have very high perception, and pass it along to other ghouls in the mob) 
---
Blocker perk (strength) is the single best defense perk for any build that has 3 points to swap in strength.  -60% incoming melee damage is very significant, considering that 100% of enemies at Whitesprings are melee, and probably 80% of enemies at SBQ are melee.  If you see a deathclaw, a couple fog crawlers or pack of strong ghouls ahead, it's not a bad idea to swap Blocker in for the nearly inevitable \[danger\] alert where your high powered rifle turns into a plinker.
---
Yup this is what I would use it for. 
---
Hunting rifles..definitely..head over to summers like as quickly as possible
---
I edited my post today to add photos so everyone can get a better idea of what I built. It is not pretty but so far it seems functional. It is sort of an above ground bunker.
---
&gt; The two-shot nerf was legitimately way too much, though. It's now one of the weakest benefits and it wrecks the accuracy so you can't hit anything easily 
---
I know, and I understand the frustration of those who got this weapon legitimately.  As in they actually killed an enemy and were lucky enough to loot it from them. 
---
But 90 percent of the TSE weapons in this game are duped and it has completely broken the balance of the game and wrecked the in-game economy in ways that most people don't comprehend. 
---
You can thank the dupers for this.  Had the game been left to function as intended,  probably 1 in 100 players would be walking around with TSE's. Thanks to dupers. they are literally everywhere. 
---
Unless Bethesda seriously gets   handle on duping, this won't be the last big nerf.  That's why I am hoping they can put a stop to duping once and for all- ALL OF IT. 
---
"But that's just not possible," you say. 
---
Well, it it's not possible, then they should not have included legendary weapons in this game. 
---
Seriously. 
---
how do you spawn him?
---
Now this is an awesome idea, take my upvote.
---
I am tired of bothering my friends or even joining on randoms and hoping they won't server hop.
---
Sorry, your little "duper laundering" scheme didn't work :(
---
They need an endgame quest that results in a partial Respec, maybe allows 5 points to be moved, after a new boss fight.  That way we can keep our Mains in the game without starting over.
---
full wipe??
---
i said "item wipe"
---
sheesh!
---
He could be well rested or eaten cranberry cobbler or drank cranberry juice 
---
I usually murder the ghouls and scorched in morgantown, ill head to summersville and see what's up
---
21:9 works ok for me ,except the crosshair display does not accurately represent accuracy anymore. 
---
The font and aspect ratio of icons/ ui pieces changed to be smaller and more square,  which takes a bit of time to get used to.
---
Poison dealing enemies have always been bad. Mirelurk Queens and stingwings in 4. Cazadors in NV. Strong dot in a damage type that most enemies have zero resistance from.
---
Not wrong. At least I admit it.
---
People are just salty when they are told no. Of course people are going to lie. Good on you.
---
I am happy about the banning Bethesda is doing.
---
Yeah found em here when I was a noob, ran like hell. Never been back yet.
---
This post made me lol. You can't even fix the game without breaking it even more. They expect me to believe that they're banning system is working correctly lol what a joke. I was caught up on they're ban wave and did not dupe. Yet I still got the same email everyone else did. 
---
Now with that said, I'm not trying to dispute the fact that I probably had/have excess amounts of the items they're talking about. But I didn't get them thru exploiting. I got them thru trading which is a totally legitimate way of acquiring items. But here I am almost a month later with my account still banned and still no reply to my ticket.
---
I'm not worried about it though, I've moved on. I will say that me and mine will never purchase another one of BGS's piles of hot garbage again.
---
I'm xbox....
---
This game is trash...
---
I do the same thing.  I'll drop any unneeded scrap, ammo and food in the blue suitcases at train stations (no blue suitcase, I drop it in the cash register) along with legendary stuff if I already maxed out all the vendors' cash for the day.  I tend to wander around Watoga and Whitesprings farming legendaries for my end game when a nuke isn't happening.
---
I almost installed this but he sends the data to a server instead of storing it locally. If it was stored local, would be legit. I guess could decompile his work and see if he's sending other information.
---
Just get over it already
---
Yes FONV is still the best Fallout imo.   
---
I have played literally all the fallouts to completion several times.    FO76 is the only one I have uninstalled in defeat.   The cons outweighed the pros for me.  Ymmv
---
Duper tears
---
YAS!
---
No game anywhere has made all things available. Grinding is what MMO are built around. You are dreaming.
---
Heard the owner is wanted for tax fraud and embezzlement.
---
Where did you find it by the way? I'm checking Watoga Station but nothing yet.
---
Oh yeah 10000% narcissistic! He's an adult (mid 30s) so there's really no excuse for him to say the things he does... he's def been emboldened by Trump's hate as well. The stuff he posts on FB is down right hateful. But I do my best to ignore it for whatever that's worth lol!
---
I use to have trouble going solo but the medic pump has done a lot to up my survivability. 
---
That's true. Locks are not worth picking for the most part.
---
Being able to hot key builds would be good. Like combat, exploring and crafting.
---
The worst is when you swap the cards and the safe is empty
---
 The heavy, sturdy and light armors are different armors. Its not an upgrade or downgrade they are different. 
---
Their problem not mine.
---
I love it..I basically 'train' all my low-level alts there til about level 10..it's nothing but super mutants..u may need to level up a little bit in the beginning..but if u use a sneaking technique and take them out 1 by one it gets easy..it takes me about 10 mins to clear the entire area..also..they have ok loot on them (caps, Molotov's, grenades).. and scrap all the weapons they drop to learn the mods..I used to server hop there to repeat
---
Why though? At 180 hours played I have gotten more than my monies worth. I'm not playing atm until more content is added, but I don't see why people would try to get a refund. 
---
Even the TSE nerf wasnt that bad. It takes me 3-4 shots to kill something instead of 1 now, oh well. With 3.5x sneak bonus I still 1 shot a lot of stuff.
---
Age doesn't matter....I'm tired of hearing all the whining from ppl that are def over 18
---
Don't believe you :P
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
Lets hope that they implement something similar themselves.
---
Unless you're an American.
---
You must be the "young" player...
---
The point he is making and you are failing to understand is the Canvas bag effected a microscopic percentage of the players outside the game.
---
It had zero impact in the game. He's specifically talking about the game, not the company marketing the game. What lies were told about Fallout 76? Zero gymnastics, zero drama, just want to know what lies about the game were told.
---
or just lot us loot in an area like we do in ESO
---
No.  No.
---
That doesn't happen.
---
What might happen is you get extradicted for it.
---
Hmm... I see your point. I never said infinite though. I'm aware that flooding the markets is a bad thing. I just think a little extra would make vendor bots a more viable option for loot instead of scraping and dropping the resulting junk.
---
I don’t have anything to prove. You put the burden of proof on yourself
---
I'm on PC but thanks for the offer! 
---
Thanks, I sometimes wish I was PC.  :)
---
Run across the beginning of the red bridge just down from the station
---
We hear you! Banning players who use a third player to transfer items between their characters! 
---
Another option would be to let you remove 1 point from the cost of certain cards at every level past 50, to let higher levels mean more.
---
let me get this straight, your proposing I start fast traveling constantly so that I can make a build, that otherwise just makes radiation heal me, viable. it seems like way to much work when I could just keep using my normal build that works well, maybe as a gimmick run but it looks like a pain in the ass
---
Let's be honest, it was a guy
---
If I saw a player looking like an olde-tyme southern baptist matron with a rolling pin coming at me, I'd be intimidated.
---
Dropped by a leg ghoul doing The Messenger Event
---
I bought the fusion generator plans. They never transferred to my inventory. However it now says known. I didn't read them however. 
---
Cheaters and exploiters doing anything they can to get public opinion on their side. Take your L and  just get a new account. Blame whomever talked you in to this sad enterprise.
---
Niceeeeee
---
You're both triggered.
---
Great team attitude lol
---
Just remove the perk cards and go back to the perk planner type perks from FO4.
---
Bethesda must know Fallout player's don't care about card packs....I mean who played fallout and thought "you know whats missing....Card packs to open or buy" 
---
This isn't FuT or Fortnite, no one wants card packs. Animated or other wise (animated perks...whats a waste of dev time).
---
Got the 76/76 bobble head completion from eating a queen mirelurk steak. 
---
Melee/Hunting Rifles/Shotguns.  At mid level, swap the Hunting for Lever Action rifles and Handmades can sub for Shotguns to conserve Plastic when you don't need to cripple with Enforcer.  At lvl 40 I basically use Lever+Handmade and keep Combat Shotgun as backup for tough fights.
---
Centaurs/ those talking deathclaws
---
No stp on snek 
---
Big facts.
---
I'm on PC picked up the game yesterday for £8 :D
---
No.  I am informing you that a build focused on regenerating is very easy to make.  And could be fun.  
---
As a side point, if players are turtling in PvP (this is assuming eventually a PvP battleground or team based combat is added), Radiation damage builds are going to be nice, as is the ability to heal versus those builds.
---
Enemy taking no damage?  Fry their asses with radiation.  
---
*"Got their arses whipped like a* *~~Novigrad~~* *Charleston whore!"*
---
I still have my account since I haven't cheated.
---
if your still playing the game and not interested in a refund .then why bother to post? you guys will defend a pile of dog shit too wouldn't you?
---
Steam and GoG didn't make it, and it required giving Fallout 1 a new wrapper, or renderer, idr if both or one or the other off hand. This is immensely easier to do then add it to a 3D game where you can end up with a ton of visual issues. 
---
I'm not too familiar with American laws of extradition.  To amend my statement I suppose we could call America 'Bethesda' and it's states would be the 'games'.  
---
As far as I know if you commit a serious crime in any state you can be held accountable for it, in another state .  
---
If that's not the case there , America is crazier than I initially thought. 
---
If you break the law in British Columbia,  you are still held accountable in any other province of Canada . 
---
You can place custom text on your walls? How...
---
Not me. I cant find any letters.
---
I play solo for a reason.
---
Sure 
---
Top of the World has a similar character/area and even has a quest line tied to it.
---
Thanks, Ill take a look.
---
I do not even start to play any character from scratch, because there is nothing waiting for me at the end. Endgame effects everyone, regardless of their point in progress.
---
Questions:
---
1) CAN I CRAFT 10-50 OF A PARTICULAR WEAPON IF I HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CREATE &amp; SCRAP THEM AND LEARN WEAPON MODS, WITHOUT BEING BANNED? 
---
2) HOW MANY ITEMS IF I HAVE THE RESOURCES SHOULD I CRAFT UP TO, AND STOP AT TO NOT BE BANNED?
---
3) IS THERE A COOL DOWN PERIOD FOR Q2 AND IF SO WHAT? 
---
(Ex. craft up to X items, and then wait 24 hours?)
---
4) CAN INNOCENT USERS TECHNICALLY STILL GET BANNED BY CRAFTING TOO MANY ITEMS LEGITIMATELY IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW YOUR 'THRESHOLDS' FOR Q2 &amp; Q3?  
---
(After all, " UNEQUIVOCALLY FALSE" leaves no wiggle room) 
---
5) CAN A USER WITH THE \~1,700 LBS WEIGHT LIMIT MAX HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO CRAFT ENOUGH ITEMS TO GET THEM BANNED (TAKING INTO ACCOUN THE LUCK SUPER DUPER PERK, AND PERKS TO REDUCE MATS REQUIREMENTS)?
---
6) IF I SEE A BAG ON THE GROUND WITH A TON OF ITEMS IN IT, WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM # OF ITEMS  I CAN TAKE OUT OF IT AND NOT GET BANNED?
---
(Ex. I need steel or health items, and I see a bag with 5,000 steel in it, can I pick that up, or say 500 nuka grapes?)
---
(If someone dropped those items; either dupers or mule accounts, what is safe for me to take as an emergent gameplay equivalent of stumbling across a treasure?) 
---
Simply pointing us active users to go read your banning policy which is vague and gives no specific to what actually triggers bans is not helpful, and seems to me more like hiding behind a policy than anything else.  You mention the 'innocent' posts in a pretty strong way, and discredit them behind the ban policy implying they were not innocent at all (did you confirm there accounts showed large evidence of being dupers? If so you completely left that information out; that response felt more like you saying those posts are 'hearsay and move along, nothing to see here to be honest...').  
---
I still feel left in the dark with this post.... I don't care about the 100,000+ item players, that seems pretty obvious to me to be dupers, but the posts about crafting say 10-50 weapons/armors to try to learn mods you didn't directly answer, and just passed us on to the banning policy leaving us with nothing but questions still.
---
I have items that I still want to craft in mass to scrap to learn mods for but I'm not doing it out of not wanting to be 'falsely' banned as I have no idea what # is safe and what # isn't.  
---
I feel like I have to navigate hoops to play this game recently with 'watch out for this (don't craft too many items), and that (don't go hunt dupers or pick up large amounts of mule characters dropped treasures), and deal with this new bug (stealth) or that new bug (RNG weight)' and it's starting to lose the 'fun' factor as a combined 300+ levels player that I have more-less patiently been dealing with a lot of your game's growing pains since release.  
---
Engage us with helpful guidance that is clear and has technical specifics.  We all know you have watchdogs now to combat duping and that's great, but I don't want to get bitten for doing something you didn't tell me I shouldn't when you had the chance to be very forthcoming and clear in this post of yours.    
---
How to get 3.5 boost? 
---
Yeah couldn't drop it either. But there was a chest I could open in one of the buildings in watoga if I remember.
---
Are you remembering to jump servers after each mutation you've picked up?
---
I made about 4000 rounds of ammo today. Didn’t get banned. How much ammo did you make?
---
Thanks, glad you liked it. Was a lot of waiting around : )
---
What’s the buff of razor grain soup? I like AP regen from corn
---
I cant imagine why... 
---
No. Perk cards are neat because they allow us to experiment. What you suggest is static and unforgiving. 
---
So the font etc has changed then. Thanks. So it's just the crosshair part of ultrawide that's broken? Cause that apparently that works fine in 16:9. Does your map show levels of 100 and over without cutting too?? Cause they supposedly fixed that but doesn't seem to be working either for me. Wondering if that's tied to the font change on ultrawide
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
Why?
---
most definitely ! hahaha
---
Nice bargain! Too bad tho, I'm on PS4 :( I build a lot of weapons and armor for new players.
---
I don’t care if you don’t believe me. They have my creation logs and can see for themselves. 
---
Highly doubt this was the reason
---
I also craft razergrain soup in bulk. Add to that all of the ore I have been smelting, I don't see any truth to the complainers 
---
Wow, this would fix two problems at the same time.  remove unwanted perk cards and being able to reset stat points quicker than 1 a level...
---
I made probably half that. Maybe like 1200 rounds or so, idk. I’m seriously pissed right now. 
---
Saw someone on discord selling for 100 a piece? Not sure if that's accurate pricing or not
---
No you can't be held accountable for it in another state.
---
You might, if the original state requests it, and it was also illegal in the state you're hiding in (not all states make the same things illegal), get arrested by that state and turned over to the first state for prosecution.
---
One mutation per server even if you clear it.
---
What you "enjoy" doesn't matter when we're talking about how Bethesda usually "fixes" their games. You can enjoy it all you want that doesn't change that Bethesda largely sucks at fixing their game to the point the rather just offload it to the modders rather then doing it themselves. Has happened all the way back with Oblivion and pretty much all their games since. 
---
The Centaurs always creeped me out from New Vegas, kinda disappointed they didn’t make the cut. Night stalkers were kinda cool too
---
It's both. Don't diminish one in favor of the other.
---
I know its for balance, but your charachter just doesnt forget how to pick a lock or hack a terminal the second you swap a card out. Im all for passive abilities in the game.
---
Honestly i play solo except for a group of friends i know but usually when i send team requests to people its usually levels 40-60 (im 170) and i just want to drop off free stuff like legendaries i dont need.
---
Just last night i did One violent night twice, Uranium fever and did a non nuked whitesprings run and picked up stuff i dont really want or need
---
and i dont care about caps and it feels wasteful to just drop it in a bag for any rando to sell
---
so i try to find ppl who i think really can use it and sometimes i ask if they want me to mod their current weapon.
---
Last night modded someones Power Fist and gave them a Vampires .50 cal with heavy barrel
---
Sometimes the team requests are benevolent.
---
i also prefer ppl w a mic because otherwise theres no way to communicate what im trying to do so ill switch between all chats (team, area, auto) for a bit hoping they hear me (ask for a thumbs up etc if they dont have one)
---
I like how it's always a friend of mine. When it's more than likely the OP who committed the offence.
---
Dang.
---
I love farming me some brahmin in Flatwoods for food/carry weight
---
What would be an easy source for food/buffs as a herbivore?
---
Honestly have never eaten more than a handful of veg in my entire playthrough 
---
It could be made with the same rules as they follow now. No one said anything about making the picks permanant i was on about the layout / design more than anything.
---
Just being able to see them all on the same screen without the pack opening BS : )
---
Oh, I see, you got banned for duping huh. I der why you're salty. Why are you still here 9 days later?
---
If we can't display our Power Armor, I'll forever be -60 in stash capacity.
---
* Raider
---
* T-45
---
* T-51b
---
* T-60
---
* X-01
---
* Excavator
---
I carry my Ultracite PA around with me so I don't count that for my stash.
---
Oh ok, I thought you meant the swapping aspect not the GUI. All good :-) 
---
Got heavy leather plans at the top train station
---
It's common enough. A buddy and I that play together and take advantage of using each others camps for refueling and repairs have been interupped at least twice by folks that are policing the duping situation. Basically they drop in, watch us for a bit, and then announce "just making sure you aren't duping" before they take off to punish wrong do'ers somewhere else.
---
Oddly enough your posts mentions they you don't the think people who pick up duped loot are guilty (and my post states "if they keep it") but then goes on to say if you picked up a bag of cash from a bank you didn't rob, would be wrong.  That's my point. If you pick up duped loot, and keep it, and profit from it, they you are wrong and should go to jail (get banned). People who do unscrupulous things and then act offended when they get caught with thier hand in the cookie jar can go get bent.
---
Clearly most of these people have never played an MMO style game from launch.

Honestly, I don’t think these cards should be passive either. But there should be loadouts. Making a choice between damage or utility doesn’t make sense because you need both equally to play this game. If you have a utility focused build, then you’re going to have a difficult time out on the field. If you are focused on damage heavy, then you can’t accomplish much at camp. That’s why everyone’s switching cards all the time and quite frankly, it’s annoying as hell. I can’t tell you how many times I was at camp, switched in my Weapon Artisan card to make repairs, then later out in the field I realize I forgot to switch it back to Demolitions Expert and have to do it mid battle. 
---
Loadouts would solve 99% of everyone’s problems with cards. I’m back in camp? Swap in my camp loadout. Going back out to farm? Swap in my field loadout. 
---
It would be so much less tedium. 
---
Do you have to deactivate pacifist to do damage on the other person?
---
trycombmusic55, we defend this game, but as for the dog crap, we are not interested in defending you.
---
Point still stands that theyd be telling every legit player to go fuck themselves and that theyre being punished for nothing. No thanks
---
75% of people in your nursing home play PC games? 
---
Yeah, not too determined to play 76... Got the Pip-Boy edition on console for the Pip-Boy and then on pc to play... Yeah that makes no sense. New Vegas is the best... So far. 
---
Say, what version of windows are you using?
---
The vendor at Sutton station sells them.  In the UI they are letters so you can do anything you can sepll.
---
Sell it to an Indie company that has the resources and passion to make it be better!
---
Ah right didn’t know, thanks.
---
I have max ST and just grabbed rank one of all the gunner and melee perks, I feel like that's a trade I can live with and not need to swap constantly to get max effect.
---
But not being able to lockpick because I don't want to waste the agility points 24/7 is silly. It's distancing itself from RP.
---
I’ve been screaming about this since getting the game. 
---
I loved this frame until recent..haven't played this week at all really
---
I reckon you'd have to pay Gamestop to take it at present ; )
---
Fake internet points seem to indicate more folks agree with me than you.
---
Expensive?
---
Your anguish sustains me, peasant.
---
I had no idea you had to do that, I've just cured myself of three good mutations on one server O.o never crossed my mind this would be needed.
---
I'll definitely relog then and see what happens. Thanks so much for the info, hoping this is the key :)
---
Bruh the Sutton and watoga vendors have it since the shit patch 
---
I didn’t know Yoshi was in fallout 76 
---
This sounds like the best solution. I hate having to throw perfectly good fusion cores away because I can't fit them into my stash.
---
I've hiding in the Grafton Station toilet for nothing then :) Will be glad for some fresh air.
---
I'm thinking maxed out Covert Operative and maxed out Mister Sandman perk cards to get the 3.5x sneak crit. 
---
Covert operative + mister sandman
---
Hey so are you guys going to fix the explosives perk or redo the tse guns also my carry weight never went up 1500
---
yeah I mean, for a solid PvP build it seems like itd be good, but for a PvE build where you are avoiding players it seems like it would have less utility. I mean if you are able to build your own decontamination shower, I know it's in game but it's a pain in the ass, the mid game when you have the perks in place but not the base built, that would be when its hardest.
---
Agreed, I really hate when you're forced to spend points on things that should be gained in a more convenient way
---
 My idea is: have a quest about some serial lockpicker who invented a super lockpick gadget/pipboy upgrade and you find his workshop
---
 Pick it up but in order to picklock anything higher than lvl 1 you must go on different quests where you go to hideouts he left these upgrades in which would be trap filled dungeon overrun with wildlife, and security systems, and boom no need to spend points, instead you go on an adventure that you know will be worth the time and effort 
---
 But instead ending there, you find another quest in the last location for the upgrade talking about a serial hacker that is his rival/lover/enemy whatever and you go investigate a tech heavy location filled with robots and techy enemies and find a safe room with said hackers gadget with yes a bunch of other quests to find the rest, they both weigh very little and won't need to be equiped *boom* 
---
 Wouldn't that be nice? (Both these ending places for each max upgrade, can have signature costumes/armor sets/pieces that go with the theme and character of the criminals, no weapons they're stealing not killing, oh and there a few more hides out containing more pieces for the sets and customization options for your pipboy)
---
You’re getting the downvotes but I’m assuming this is a Scott Steiner Terrence which means you get my upvote.
---
That wasn't the base... That was all of it.
---
Thanks for missing the obvious that the nerf to the Demo perk was too heavy handed making a number of the valid weapons and weapon types under powered, next time I'll keep my complaining simple so the common Reddit user can comprehend, such as yourself. Cheers :)
---
Theres a great mod for PC that lets you seap between 8 loadouts. I have one for solo, one for group, one for crafting, one for lockpick and hack, one for max weight reduction (the most important of all)
---
Proof or you are the exact reason Bethesda had to make that post refuting the thing you are claiming . 
---
I guess I should have said "as guilty". My main point is, while I would never dupe myself, I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't pick up a TSE from a bag of 50k items.
---
Very.  IIRC over 10k for the neon ones. There are some cheaper letter set such as the the metal letter set sold by the vendor inside watoga city.
---
Best Little Ghoulhouse in Appalachia
---
Maybe try r/thathappened
---
As said in the post, no food was eaten. That includes drinks in this case. 
---
Extraordinarily so. I \*believe\* that they're the preciest item in the game. Roughly 11,000 caps. (9400 for me, with Charisma 9 and Big Deal 3.)
---
I thought that to start with bit turns out I'm not in a team
---
"Dupers only duped TSE" 
---
They were able to make items from nothing, they duped it all
---
Reminds me of a random dude whose team I joined. I traveled to his CAMP and affixed the glowing words "Free Blowjobs" to his wall next to his door without telling him and let him discover it for himself later. 
---
Wherever this game is discussed your opinions can an have likely been influenced this includes this sub.  You can claim to avoid all the videos but if you post an respond you have been influenced by others unless of course you are one of those I'm always right you're wrong types that disregards others when met with an actual discussion.
---
Nah PS4
---
Dood get a lyfe, theres moore out there to exspeareance. Life isnt strickly about curreckting gramur.
---
That being said, stop being a fucking prick dude. You're not proving any kind of point. Other than you're a dickhead
---
Not during workshop combat. 
---
You could only do this if we have set servers. Right now you server hop so much it would be impossible. 
---
JUST GIVE (sell) US EXCAVATOR SKINS ALREADY!
---
You don't need a third person.

I’ve got the exact same weapon and I love it. Nothing like doing 400-500 dmg with a lead pipe.

#duperproblems
---
I think 0 cost makes more sense for lockpicking/ hacking and some crafting perks. Loadouts should be a thing too, but I'd rather those just be for different combat profiles (solo, team, stealth, etc).
---
Okay, it worked, Thanks
---
Hahaha nice one!
---
Bethesda even Stated they are first working on fixing the bugs, and then release new content. You can't please both. If they decided to release new content this subreddit and other subreddits and don't forgot gaming news websites, youtubers all will be raging on Bethesda for not fixing the game first.
---
See ya.  Never understood the need for folks to post these but you do you. 
---
That is a lie that was used to sell the game. You can not seperate a game and that games marketing when speaking of false advertising 
---
Rather than using big letters, why don't you go off and just tag the community managers? 
---
I remember seeing talk about making a sub for nuke alerts not sure if it happened . On Xbox I just look at the looking for group post fastest way to find a nuke imo.
---
I wish bounties worked the same... I hate toggling just to kill a wanted person.
---
i have never found anything “great” in a locked container. a few plans but nothing that others would “ooh” and “aah” about.
---
Ahhh nighttime 3.5
---
FYI that’s not all of his routes so can’t fully rely on it
---
Why don't you tell me where I can find them in one place rather than making me feel bad for using big letters? 
---
same, healing factor is op for me
---
is there a better map? or you just know its incomplete?
---
Out no TSE kills groups of enemies in one shot, let's nerf them into the ground.
---
My melee kills one target in one shot let's buff it to kill groups of enemies in one shot
---
Yeah, Fallout 76 is starting to drown cuz there not coming out with any good dlc’s with new things to do. Heads up, if u do the momma dolce event, be aware that when u put the items needed into the hopper and u’r wearing u’r power armor, u can accidentally put pieces of u’r suit in there while u’r still wearing it. Once that happens, u can’t get it back unless u build another piece that u lost in the hopper. I’ve done it twice so far. I just try to get the items in the hopper needed for the event in there so fast so I don’t lose much time for the event. That SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. So I don’t make that mistake again, I will NEVER do the momma dolce event ever again. Has this happened to anyone else? It’s things like that, that makes me not want to play the game. A friend of mine lost his daisy cutter and his all rise due to a terrible glitch that Bethesda fixed 3 days later. 3 days too late! Bad job Bethesda. There losing there Fallout community. There goin to bury themselves if they don’t come out with more content and quests. It’s seriously sooooo bored with it. BETHESDA, DO SOMETHING ALREADY BESIDES PATCH FIXES!!!!!!!
---
Make around 2k-4k 5mm ammo daily in one sitting mashing that button, yet to be banned. 
---
We don't believe you
---
You don't get banned for crafting unless you made 100k items in the last 30 days
---
This has to be a troll. Are you honestly that dumb?
---
make all weapons decently viable late game like seriously 
---
Try Christaghoul out. Top quality p.... And a..
---
Yes, I'll believe any announcement they make over what people here say. This sub, even for a popular gaming sub, has shown an impressive array of toxicity and dedication to ruining as many people's day as possible. Not to mention that this exact thing has happened in so many other games where people get banned rightfully and make up stories for attention or pity or an attempt to get unbanned. Bethesda has been unable to keep some promises, and screwed many things up in updates, but we are all aware that there are some serious competency issues and general chaos over at the studio. They don't blatantly lie about things like this
---
I endorse this sarcastic comment. 10/10 accurate
---
4LC has been made useless from the last patch that “fixed” critical. My guess is they though crit chaining was bad.
---
There’s an END perk that cures radiation by daylight too
---
Even if I can see where you come from  a point you raised should have more attiontion in my opinion: melee builds are totally fucked imbalanced.
---
Incisor is what? 3stars perk giving 75% armor pen while there is nothing remotely comparable in non melee builds. Pvp will fall flat if they dont put some balance effort in before it coming out.
---
I can see Survivor mode being a stupid Street Fighter V simulator.
---
Yeah, it's not like the game logs your activity or anything
---
So that my lone wanderer becomes useless? Nah.
---
Hahaha, crispy
---
11000 caps well spent
---
I just know it’s incomplete. I’ve seen him multiple times by whitespring yet on that map it doesn’t show a route near it. So if they missed a big area like that there is bound to be more. He also doesn’t stick strictly to roads and can take some pretty weird paths. I saw him and chally walk down and up an entire cliff instead of just crossing the bridge.
---
I’ve seen him going south on the road between whitespring and the train station so it’s definitely incomplete. Not sure if there’s a better one though. 
---
You can be kind and still be upset with this games issues
---
Mutation serum recipes cost about 22k without any perks/ch, but I think other than that, signs and letters is the most expensive
---
I'm a curious person so I found the two methods on YouTube that are popular. Namely the artillery box and the make a million boards methods. It sounds like there are others but I haven't been able to find the methods anywhere.
---
Is there some secret fraternity for these guys or something? 
---
What do calibrated shocks do? I'm woefully uniformed about what and of these power armor mods do (the jet pack is pretty self explanatory)
---
Cool lets go find him!
---
Everything except two handed melee has already been nerfed into the ground dude.
---
I might actually come back if I could actually transfer stuff to other characters without needing to go through adding random people to friends to get back into a server I was just on.
---
*friends quit long ago and aren't returning*
---
since the mod exists for pc how about besthesda just makes it into the core game for everyone else please.
---
Kind of sounds like you limited yourself to what you can do. So...that'd be on you and not Bethesda, right?
---
Your post has nothing to do with your title, you just sound like a whiney baby. 
---
Empty your stash into your inventory. Once fully empty, is the weight at 0? If not, post a screenshot for proof
---
Melee pros: No ammo needed, best perk card choices in game, strength stat directly increases Damage, being close to a target can be mitigated by perks in main stat block, most melee weapons have a mod to increase pen on top of the best perk card for pen(75%vs36%)
---
Didn’t mean to imply I have not got any good drops. I mean I have not got any drops I actually wanted. 
---
I spend the majority of my time farming legendaries. I have multiple explosive shotguns including a quad double barrel that still wrecks after the nerf. A few instigating explosive and other random explosives. I have a 2 shot or explosive version of just about every gun now, just not both effects on one.
---
Technically I lied when I said I have not found any AACrit weapons or FuriousE as I have a AACrit less vats 50 cal and FuriousE Guass, but those are not ideal combinations for those weapons imo, at least not for my characters.
---
Im sure ill get my version of a “perfect” weapon sometime in the next 500 levels...lol.
---
"QWUEEN ON ME! OnLY BIG BOYS ALLOWED!" - Xbox LFG posts....
---
Sorry but at this point we are playing essentially the same character, damage and weight reduction who occasionally opens up their menu for a second to switch to lock picking or hacking if needed. The perk system needs to be overhauled tremendously and when I say tremendously I mean serious reorganization and reallocation of entire cards with various buffs or needs to compensate. There shouldn’t be three damage perk cards per weapon, just a single one with 9 ranks. Adding the artificial level gateway to some better perks also makes to so players have no idea what their build could look like early on without knowing “oh I get this card at level 45 that completely changes the game” ahead of time. 
---
Oh I would but I play on PS4
---
Well, it’s not from duping. I’ve never duped. And I’m not just trying to make up a story. Look at my post history. I’m an avid “anti-duper” and love his game. This feels really shitty. Like I’ve been robbed or something. 
---
How not?
---
Last I checked on ps4 I couldn't get back into the server I left unless the person I was trying to join was a friend.  If not I have to add them as a friend and then the option to "join" will appear. 
---
If the is another way I'd be interested to hear it
---
"I’m hesitant to post this since this sub is pretty toxic"
---
Well *screeeeeeeeew* you.
---
 * Toxics off into the distance, spaghetti-like and glitching * 
---
Not true, I’m proof of that. 
---
So, radscorpion stingers and bloatfly glands are STILL not unscrappable? It's not like those syringer barrels are even worth it, but come on...
---
Mostly just group chats on xbox (and discord I assume) that I am not privy too. 
---
They only include other dupers, to limit the chance of being exposed. 
---
They wouldn't need support for that they could already do it, they're not gonna do that
---
Great ideas, well done!
---
People will be dropping items to avoid the ban or be able to move so they may pop up, and common sense is not so common. 
---
This is something I would've expected to see in Fallout 2.
---
And a workbench right there to scrap them. 
---
How does it ease up on grind? 
---
YOU got the item by farming but it's not for that build so you transfer it to another character setup for that build.
---
The game has been out 3 months, and anyone who plays the game 2-3 hours a day since release could have easily completed all the quests and beat the SBQ several times. Players who can’t manage this or say they are still much further behind in progress have likely refused looking online for help and lack the ingenuity to figure out many gameplay elements.
---
Honestly a person could start a new character and complete every quest and be level 50 in easily 50 hours, if they played straight through focusing on the completion.
---
The game does desperately need new content, I’ve seen thousands of people above level 100. All of these people are waiting for new content.
---
Which wouldnt be a problem if the product was good enough on release...
---
No. It isn't about build management at all. It's about acquired knowledge vs active perks. If you know something you don't forget it when you unequip a card. That doesn't make sense. Once you know it, you know it.
---
You can't know things like stronger hits with a sledgehammer. That stuff should be active and require a card to be active. The knowledge stuff, like lock picking, hacking, crafting, should be passive. 
---
I'm not personally worried it was a hypothetical statement.
---
1) PC
---
2) nihonniboku
---
3) n/a

4) While doing the quest Belly of the Beast, as the signal directed me to the Glassed Cavern, I began being chased by two scorchbeasts. Never having fought one on my own before, let alone two, I ran directly towards the cavern entrance, ignoring the scorched people mulling about. As I entered the cavern, every single scorched spawned with me right by the entrance, as well as a scorchbeast. While traveling through the cavern battling the scorched, I'd hear the scorchbeast flying around just outside the borders of the cavern, occassionally spreading its radiation fog through the walls of the cavern. I finally reached the end of the cavern, ready to fight the scorchbeast waiting for me there, when the scorchbeast that had been stalking me clipped through the ceiling, and I found myself facing two scorchbeasts. Luckily, the scorchbeast that had followed me in from outside spent most of its time flying about, only popping in through the ceiling every once in a while to attack me before taking off again. I was able to kill the intended scorchbeast, did my quest goals, and sprinted out the back exit, and fast traveled to my camp.
---
Saaaaame
---
I'd say he is minority, because if this game was balanced and bug free, playerbase would tell:"There is so much to do, so much to see. I am level 35 and I haven't even started doing quests". He is not the minority if you consider him among the people who all have left because there is no endgame content.
---
Well that did seem to do something, I just obtained the Herbivor Mutation soon after logging into new server. I think I need to keep at it until I have all available mutations then start to cure one, gain one until I have eliminated the negatives for my melee build.
---
Should be fun :)
---
*Hell on earth. I encountered them on my explosives character. Fighting them was no walk in the park.
---
I’m laughing because you felt the need to respond
---
And there's the rub. What's their secret handshake to get in? 😉
---
You can't trade in destiny, why would they do this there?  Also, they'd need ALL the DLC as well, if they could trade, which they can't.
---
Cheating in Destiny is fucking stupid, pointless, and doesn't matter.
---
Good thing you let people know how to do the glitch. 
---
In my experience he has had a slightly higher change of spawning if you claim a workshop. I have claimed poseídon, the food factory, and some other one, and each of those times he spawned right on the road. Not sure if this is a thing or just luck
---
It needs end game...but not scripted Raids that get cracked in 2 hours and run the exact same way 100 times.
---
We need dynamic content. An evolving world. Something to keep us coming back.
---
true... a man can dream XD
---
 Was it a not battered clipboard? 'Cause you get a screw too, if its new. ;)
---
I’d take a clipboard over flare gun or drill.
---
In case you get tired of that you can easily find players that sell the Serums really cheap.
---
Actually it was. Thanks for the screws too 👍
---
Most people are announcing leaving not to you and I but to Bethesda. Its easier than writing them a letter directly.
---
I beloeve the 50 cal only has the heavy barrel mod atm
---
A note and some random chems/ammo. Nothing special. 
---
There are so many useless perk cards. Why not have a CHA card that increases vendor caps?
---
Obvious "knowledge cards" should cost 0.
---
Hacking, Lock-picking, Super-duper, Ammo-smith, Bargain Trader, Traveler, diverse INT pekrs…
---
Anyone who plays the game for long (+70 lvl) willing to perform actions in the proper manner, ends absolutely bored and frustrated with this perk system.
---
No one in the company tested the game over level 70 to realise it? 
---
If they would do it like borderlands did then it won't be game breaking. In borderlands 2 there is a storage container to transfer items between characters. It holds 4 items of I remember correctly and that's it. It doesn't matter what character you are on it will always have those items there and you will have to take something out in order to put another in. 
---
The only rifle I need to repair regularly is my The Dragon. It breaks after like 20 shots. Which doesn't make any sense.
---
Unfortunately yes
---
Changing the map with the G.E.C.K. sounds nice but it would be as repetitive as nuke zones and it would cause issues with continuity (every Vault only had one G.E.C.K.)
---
You mean people lie about how/why/if they've been banned in video games?  ON REDDIT!?  
---
SAY IT AIN'T SO.
---
Now that's worldbuilding
---
That could very well explain it, because I got that mod a while back.
---
I love all the ideas. I do want some faction related stuff though. Great job!!
---
 LOL. Every morning my guy goes up the the Fissure not far from his house and does a Scorchbeast. Its become a ritual now and sets him up for his day. ;)
---
dont get me wrong it's a awesome drop and I'll definitely use it and I guess I might sound a bit like the kid at the party complaining about a gift but it's more that I came so close to a near perfect drop and you just have to laugh at that point and well misery loves company :) 
---
Pretty sure they made it to where you can't revive someone you killed. 
---
You have been robbed. That’s a whole lot of time and effort to just lose out on. 
---
Looks very half done. Hope to see it more fetched out.
---
That sucks man I hope they get this solved!!!
---
Ty, I love this game and this really stinks ;(
---
Then a bunch of people will whine but I want to send more stuff and I have keep logging in and out and doing this and that. Can't make everyone happy :( but I sure would be with this
---
Lol? Because this mentally unstable dude has been harassing me over an auto correct so I'm getting a laugh out of how triggered he is. In no way am I upset over this disillusioned moron.
---
You are clearly mad about the nerf to tse's, which you likely didnt even actually earn given your clear ineptitude. Just another person angry that the guns they bought are nerfed.
---
But when I found an afk bounty I could keep hitting him and revive him every time he fell to his knees until I officially killed him and claimed the bounty. 
---
My instigating Armor piercing silenced gauss disagrees
---
Yo same 
---
Yes, I never use rad-x anymore. Think it had something to do with radworm disease ticking off. Radworm was gone and relogging got my jump back.
---
Ty for understanding my frustrations. 
---
While we're at it, can we fix the radius on the NukaQuantum grenade? Its like throwing a little blue fart...
---
Actually, only certain Vaults had a G.E.C.K. at all. But all that has to be done is to add some minor lore that says one of the Appalachian Vault held the factory that built the G.E.C.K.S. for the other Vaults.
---
Congrats.  glad that fixed it for you.  Just remember, there are low-paid interns @ Bethesda watching over you &amp; deciding which mutation to give &amp; which to take away.
---
What you want will always be last &amp; what you lose will always be the one you want to keep the most.  and they'll do that will a gleeful cackle
---
yeah thats because its not ballistic its energy
---
Did you get an email with any reasons listed?  Have you bought anything lately that could have been duped or from the developer room?  If you legitimately can't figure out why all you can do is contact Bethesda and wait for an answer.  But threatening and giving a one hour time frame isn't going to help.
---
I don't know how PS4 works, but on Xbox as long as their account is public you can join their game. So, all you have to do is leave your items in a container, and log in and out of the same server.
---
40mm?
---
Tell how to prove it and I’ll do it
---
We need to have Reddit trials for these cases because I am sure all of these posts are full of shite. You duped, you got banned. 
---
No. I didn’t. 
---
It’s not content that is lacking, its character progression 
---
Yeah, that would actually be nice. From what we know Vault 94 would be perfect for a “G.E.C.K. factory“
---
Seems like it should be under ballistic though.
---
This has happened to me too. It’s really quite pathetic that people have nothing better to do than be arseholes
---
They're assholes
---
You do understand that bethesda doesn't run this subreddit right?
---
I see this more and more, people are just getting bored. It was fun at first, but it has gotten old.
---
Also, somehow I read you need three people, I think I responded to the wrong comment.
---
why? 
---
&gt; It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Have we actually gotten that confirmed by someone at Bethesda? You never know if they've set it up in some stupid fashion.
---
Woah woah, If it is in the game its in the game that is always the developers fault bar none. 
---
Yes, but they read it
---
You can go ahead and ban my account the game sucks. It’s like having a old friend that you had some fond memories with come stay at your place. Next thing you know that same friend went into your wallet and stole all your money.  It’s an embarrassment to release this game in it current state.
---
2mm electromagnetic 
---
REALLY?!? Cus you just banned me and I’ve NEVER duped!! I will turn in my game to gamestop for store credit unless this gets resolved within the hour. 
---
Yea and that does me too haha 
---
This is getting so tired. You bought a game with PVP in it; the end. 
---
The problem at endgame isn’t content, it’s the lack of a well designed gameplay loop driving character progression. Full RNG isn’t it.
---
I was going to say... I've sat crafted a lot of boards and other things in one time period and then scrapped them to learn more mods etc. Never been ban. Thanks for your research! 
---
The way they detect it is mass crafting. I heard a guy got banned for making 20 gamma guns so obviously the system isn’t perfect yet
---
Internet superiority is often the only victory that a griefer can achieve in their sad lives.
---
I dont know, PVP does nothing for me in this game.
---
Yes, they emailed me asking me to explain “excessive item creation” I can’t recall anything I created in excess. I made about 1200 rounds of ammo. Maybe more. This is not against the terms of service. 
---
Same thing just happens to me, I was happy to finally found the mothman. I didn't there was plenty types of them.
---
My brother told me that the wise mothman I killed was supposed to be friendly. But it attacked me on sight. He was on the bridge at the south of Point Pleasant.
---
I got this bug before the Hotfix. 
---
I don't know. I don't dupe.
---
Wait until you get to the sad set of tapes. The quest that starts above bog town ugh.
---
Because its not like it’s firing plasma or a laser. It a steel/lead bullet propelled by an electromagnetic force which is derived from the gun. (Or at least I thought) 
---
Wouldn't we all. What does that have to do with seeing peoples levels however 
---
Oh, that's fantastic  I'm headed for Charleston right now.
---
Bull. There is a path to all the things in mmo games. Even when the path requires months of grinding. Right now, you kill the sbq for a chance to win some random item. In an mmo you have a chance to win a specific item or group of items. 
---
I once spent a month in Stratholme to get a Deathcharger. Goal oriented grinding, not Slot Machines.
---
Jetpack should be rare. Arm and leg x01 power armor mods should be achievable.
---
I’m pretty sure dear hearts and gentle people *is* in the game though
---
It’s a plan you buy from a vendor I’m pretty sure 
---
This one seen here is expensive and called Letters and Signs, there's a cheaper smaller one called Small Letters that is just alphanumerics on a white background.
---
Done it countless times - also player trading results in a dialog to offer something for sale immediately.  The controls are broken indeed.
---
Wait you WHAT?!
---
As you can clearly see though, Bethesda can't make the fucking letters line up, no matter how hard you try.....
---
It wasn't pvp. It was me getting nuked. I couldn't of done anything about it. It just sucks. 
---
Yeah no the guy said he made 20 gamma guns and didn't get banned.
---
&gt;Nocturnal rolling pin
---
I do my best baking at night.
---
No, just no.... Singleplayer games are those that inevitably die, online games don't, except this one, because this one is badly designed. Thanks to endgames and PVP, online games have thousands of hours replayability. CSGO, you put hundreds of hours into single map and even after that you find that map entertaining, because enemy is other player and you never know how that enemy may surprise you. In online rpg's you usually spend so much time doing raids and collecting viable gear, by the time you are done with it, there is already new expansion coming and if you somehow manage to beat PVE, there is PVP that has basically has no ending.
---
LMAO 
---
In the Mire there is Mr Dolly campgrounds or something like that, There are always 2 Yao Guais and 3 Ticks
---
I find it amusing that we have to debate about what aspect of the game sucks more. I've spent more time playing fallout games than I care to admit, but this one is rough. Hopefully in time with updates and dlc it will be something we can truly enjoy to play. 
---
Oh ok got that info from a juicehead video guess he’s not a trustworthy source but regardless if you make a bunch of items no matter what your intention is you could get banned
---
Moonshiners shack has a couple then run down to Gilman Lumber Mill and theres some all around. 
---
Anyone tested Grognak outfit?
---
Actually you are wrong with the economy now as it is..the cap stash nerf and the moth eggs nerf..killing players for junk is a very viable means of making caps..I even wear my excavator armor just to entice people to attack thinking the same..
---
Don’t hate the raider life..cause it makes sense
---
I like rad worms bugged the way they are, I just want them to fix the recovery and leave it in-game 
---
Common BGS, embrace your bugs. When you have one that makes interesting game play, keep it and clean it up,  example: feed the people fed all the people, that was really cool, they could have just left it alone, or made it so it made an announcement that food was available at the plant and send everyone there for an interesting interaction 
---
Likely boredom. 
---
No they Don't, Moderators of this subreddit do. which to be clear do not work for bethesda.
---
No end game content. No ability to form a community. No way to truly affect the world around you. They stripped everything that made a good fallout game, introduced nothing that makes a good survival game. 
---
Where is it bro? 
---
Dirty cheater gtfo
---
This brings up the subject of, are there really that many people that want the game to get bad rep \*this\* bad?
---
You and me both. I hope this doesn’t happen to you or anyone else. 
---
Games boring. It’s all you can do at lvl 250, I stopped playing but towards the end of my time I started doing this
---
Vault...96? The one to the NE. Also Jesus Sunday's compound
---
^^#DuperLyfe
---
My first character can't do any dailies. They never start. Haven't done Jack's pumpkin house in two or so months.
---
Not sure if this was random but when I went to top of the world i was attacked by a bunch of ticks.  Havent been back yet so dont know if they are always there.
---
its a good thing that like yourself, they dont matter either. 
---
Top of the world has lots of tick spawns.
---
And they like to pick on the weaker
---
But what about the hootiest owls?
---
From your previous posts, you say you hunt dupers and take their junk. If you really did that then they have a log of you suddenly accumulating huge amounts of items. So maybe, thats why. Hard to differentiate a hunter who takes duped items from a duper. 
---
I didnt mean it as a bragging point..  I am in agreement with you. I enjoy constantly switching outfits, and after awhile the atomshop becomes the only option 
---
That sucks, hope you get it resolved. I don't think they'll get back within the hour though. But maybe they will.
---
so put 12 points in each, still have 8 free and you lose 9% damage, and have every wep near maxed.  Using a low heath build with your system will be the only way to play.  It would be broken as hell.
---
I have built 6 chars from 0 to \~60.  And the only time i did not have room for Fun cards was when i was maxing damage over all or using pistols(pistol sneak is just sad for lack of spaces in agi)
---
 The Perk card bloat is intended and working fine.  If you want to max damage then your going to need to use all your perks.  If on the other hand you want to run efficient build you can take the 30% damage with only 3 slots used.  This leaves 6 slots for Fun stuff.  I do this all the time and it may take 1 more shot to kill something vs 9 slots.    
---
Cheaters get bans.   Get wrecked.
---
I still love playing 76 but it really feels like a sort of stockholm syndrome, I think dlc can make this game brilliant as you said.
---
This was happening to me before and after the patch. Very annoying but I don’t think it was touched in The patch.
---
For me it’s my right leg that unequips.
---
Liar.
---
I found a cap stash last night with 117 caps . First one Ive found so i didn't know if it was supposed to be that much or what
---
Hopefully you never find yourself in my position. I play the game and grind like everyone else. I put in over 600 hours. I’m no cheater. 
---
Nicely done, sir.
---
Fuck 'em. They can spend the caps like everyone else.
---
Not to mention that both characters have to go to Whitesprings so there's already limitations to making a mule fresh out of Vault 76, I think this is an amazing idea.
---
Cheater
---
Never thought they did. If they don't read the subreddit why to you see official responses from them all the time.
---
only one not yet confirmed 
---
I had this issue with two different 10mm pistols.
---
😚 are you inviting me to your bed? 
---
That’s due to a level up I’m sure. Your budget cap increases as you level up, but you won’t see it until you re-log in and it ‘re-builds’ your camp. 
---
I really wish that when you “view” your PA from your inventory (R3 for us PS4 folks), that it would show you what was attached on that particular PA.
---
Interesting, never happened to me before the Hotfix. Might have existed a while but has become more persistent after the "Fix" then.
---
Think about what you had, not what you made. It's likely that they don't monitor your actions, only the total quantity of stuff that you have at a point in time.
---
 Its the same problem ESO has. The dropped stuff is better than what you can make. This is a problem endemic to MMO games as the people who just want to run around killing stuff always outnumber those of us who actually do RP.
---
This guy gets it
---
$20 would be a lot more reasonable.  
---
I feel like if that was how it started, $20, followed by good expansions for another $20 each (kinda like following the WoW system without a membership) would have done Bethesda wonders. Hindsights 20/20 though :/
---
Every online game has this, sadly. From feeders to grievers to trolls. Internet anonymity feeds the ego
---
Yeah, fuck me for expecting it to be balanced at all.
---
I didn't have junk. It wasn't at ME. It was at MY BASE. The only thing they gained was me having to fix my base. They gained nothing. 
---
Bulked junk doesn’t have CND and could be database stored as currencies (just a number)
---
Make bulked junk weight 0, problem solved
---
 I have been bulking mine. ;)
---
I'm trying to minimise the need for adding more passive perks like ammosmith, hacker, picklock etc. 
---
*double facepalm* 
---
I’m not in a nursing home. 
---
I’m offering an easier to understand metaphor for how your misattribution  of statistical data is called **not statistics**. It’s an amateur mistake nobody who did stats 101 or coveted stats in high school would ever make. 
---
Perhaps take that course or whatever approximation of it you can access in your life when you get an opportunity. 
---
Jesus fucking Christ how may times are you gonna post about being banned to this sub
---
When crafting it, it's called a energy ammo. Get batteries included, it reduces power cores weight too.
---
Liar
---
There is an achievement for griefing 20 players. Don’t hate the player hate the game. 
---
Jump servers it will straighten out. 
---
True, I'm not saying anyone is but to unlock say, all armor mods you definitely need to craft many hundreds, if not thousands.
---
I could see that getting flagged at worst and causing one to hit the weight cap at best but also, I don't think that is a fun pursuit and shouldn't be the only way to learn mods :)
---
Thanks for the completely vague and worthless post. 
---
Ok thanks
---
The general steakhouse has a bit of everything aside melons and gourds
---
Yeah game is super dry. Kept logging in but running loops to find legendaries (99% being vendor trash) and dropping nukes to endure unplayable amounts of network lag has caused me to step back until there is some kind of end game introduced.
---
It took 3 ranged shots with my TS Fatman to down a 91 glowing deathclaw... which seems off.
---
Yup.  Sunkissed.  Best and easiest if you don't have starched genes
---
That's the thing this game doesn't always follow lore. The gauss rifle in this game is considered an energy weapon( although it should be ballistic) and thus has to use energy type ammo.
---
shotgun shells or .308 ammo or .50 cal
---
Come on in pussy lovers! Here at the Charleston Whorehouse we’re slashing pussy in half! Give us an offer on our vast selection of pussy. This is a pussy blow out! We got ghoul pussy, scorched pussy, glowing pussy, diseased pussy, legendary pussy, bloated pussy, irradiated pussy...
---
(Please no ban for kind of quoting a movie :D)
---
Hey, if the guy bought those plans for 11,000 caps you can put up whatever the hell he wants
---
Yes, I got mine as an event reward
---
I feel the exact same way, hit level 111 and got every set of power armor, best weapons, and did all main and pretty much all the important side quest and just got bored. I love Fallout and I love the game, but it gets boring.
---
Thousands more are coming until I get a response from them. Stay tuned. 
---
My explosive ammo is the weight issue at the moment... gotta get the weight perk for it
---
Because the moderators relay info to bethesda. Bethesda themselves don't read a majority of these posts. 
---
I mean, what you think matters doesn’t matter to me. If I enjoy a game, I enjoy it. I’d rather do it my way than throw a fit and try to make everyone else miserable. The bugs will be worked out. Meanwhile, it’s playable and I’m having fun. I don’t need previous experience or some kind of weird loyalty or hatred of Bethesda to decide for me. I’m not gonna suddenly not enjoy the game because other people want to keep being mad. 
---
I just put em outside with concrete barriers around them (the little ones, stacked two high). A couple turrets and a spotlight and it takes care of itself. I was lucky enough to find a pretty good spot by accident though. Seems like wandering mobs only ever come from one direction, so covering there plus one turret covering my crops in case of mole rats is enough
---
Just make one mega thread with all your complaints, dont spam the same shit over and over.
---
I'm also wondering about this too
---
You're lying, but that's not the worst part. Your lying, and not responding to tickets, but that's still not the worst part. The worst part is that you're lying and have the fanboys in this sub eating out of your hand. I am glad that I'm banned and will be unable to buy your products in the future. I've given up on the company and the dogshit people that still believe your sweet little lies. 
---
It’s the new bug, my pipe bolt has that problem 
---
Well I've come to the same problem as you so I've started making my own quests like with the new Manta Man suit on I task myself with going after mirelurks and assisting citizens (other players) 
---
The Gauss Rifle is so weird when it comes to perks. It gets its gun perks from non-automatic rifle perks but its ammo perks from energy ammo perks.
---
Go away
---
This guy again....cheater
---
He's right, the game is trash and so is Bethesda.
---
Realistically a lead pipe or pool cue shouldn't do as much damage as a 50 Cal machine gun or shotgun with explosive bullets
---
I've seen people with it
---
Yea... well the way the game goes you typically have to build around your best legendary drop. Since that for me is a 3star handmade I will need to focus on that. Too bad, I like the Gauss but can only afford to allocate so much on weight reduction. 
---
Oh well. 
---
They probably wanted you to fight back for the caps
---

---
Same for the AGL just a heavy barrel.
---
Won't happen to me unless I dupe. You on the other hand.
---
Yes, quite strange that they did that. 
---
The workshop by Silva Farm on the west side of the map.  Shitload of razor grain. 
---
If I ever find, I'll gladly make anyone one if they provide their own materials. I'm also gonna throw a party. With unicorn hats. 
---
And you’re posting this here why? What are we supposed to do about it? 
---
Just check out how toxic the thread about this is over there.  
---
Trim off classfreak then turn it back on
---
Post on their official boards.
---
I seriously doubt posting on Reddit will accomplish anything.
---
sounds like it doesnt exist
---
Awesome it worked, thanks
---
So you've resorted to duping reddit posts instead? You have a sickness, my friend. 
---
How do you find using heavy weapons (assuming that’s what you do from your comment)?
---
I’ve heard they’re fairly lacklustre. But it’s pretty fun launching MIRV’s
---
This exact same thing keeps happening to me Everytime my rad worms get cured. Everything is fucked at that point and I have to relog. 
---
 So do you want the plans for the BOS mod to Combat Armor or the actual Combat Armor plans which come in Heavy, Sturdy and normal Combat Armor.
---
 These things are not the same. ;)
---
Mantis, cazadors, spore mutants, centaurs, tunnelers, and ghoulrillas (Bigfoots).
---
Also bighorners... 
---
It's one of 3 guns I dont have, along with assault rifle and fat man. probably locked behind crazy rng still
---
I’m posting on here until I get a response. I’m going to blow this feed up about how they’re banning innocent players until they respond or reinstate my account. 
---
Sadly, I just don't Trust Bethesda anymore, so I cannot believe them. I've seen their incompetence firsthand. Bethesda used to be my favorite Dev/Producer of games.
---
Now you are EA to me, well at least EA has good game mechanics and fixes their bugs, but I cannot fathom anything lower than EA. I guess that category is now Bethesda.
---
I know people on this subreddit won’t like it but that’s all I play for now. Destroying other people and their bases is what makes it fun for me. Not running queen and whitesprings, but destroying people
---
Prove it to them, not us. They laid out their reasoning on this sub yesterday 
---
*toothpaste... WTF
---
That's actually quite brilliant. Just use it as a cross-character stash.
---
Lol wut? 
---
sorry to hear that man :/
---
As much as i love this game things never stop piling up. 
---
Anthem is coming 
---
I don’t consider myself a hoarder, but I do like to collect the unique weapons and apparel.    Over 450 pounds of my stash is taken up with those items (but I’m talking myself into selling the 48-pound Bunker Buster since it can be repurchase at the Enclave).  I’m not completing any more quests until the stash size is increased, as I don’t have any space for new unique items...  This is also keeping me from pursuing a set of X-01 PA that I’d like to have.
---
I guess my message to Bethesda is that the stash limit is truly limiting how much I play FO76.
---
I kinda like the slight offline lettering in this though.
---
To the coward who downvote me, show yourself.
---
I got toothpaste from a 3* - maybe we found the keymaster and gatekeeper of the bunch.  WTF Bethesda...
---
The only thing you're going to get from that is banned from this subreddit aswell.
---
"False Accusations"
---
I don’t think they do, their system for detecting cheating must be flawed 
---
Did same - but it was like the loot was from a bunch of 5's and 10's with a 16 thrown in for fun.  I don't get what the fuck they are thinking here.
---
DMV quest wasn’t even bad lol 
---
Because they ain’t any rules saying you can’t do that.
---
What ? Just because he was banned doesn’t mean he was duping. I’m not saying he was, or that he wasn’t, but people are being banned for NOT duping, and that is a fact. 
---
Not being a duper,  I'm very confident 
---
There were posts about people doing this same thing... I just found one that looked identical and it didn't say "steal" so while it may have been a glitch, I wasn't about to take a chance on someone twice my level being a dick.
---
If you’re on the PS4, I can give you some.
---
Thanks will check these out
---
I for one would like the wanderer in the game
---
After a certain amount of hours i gave up on lock picking l. It seems everything in the world is behind a god damn lock. It eventually becomes  ac low payout chore. I put in thousands of hours in the 3,vegas and 4 and i feel like you use lockpicking 10% of the time compared to 76. Now in 4 i added the easy picking mod due to ptsd.
---
Why not help them? 
---
Correct!
---
I'm a little bit upset that there's only one color. In Fallout 4 there were quite a few different colors!
---
Was hoping for actual advice
---
I see your point. Like maybe your base perception should affect lockpicking and base INT hacking
---
You can set up a pretty easy method for growing your own
---
Because I have. I have helped people. I have ran nukes. I’ve never been a destroyer, and it’s a refreshing change thankfully 
---
Woa man you are spamming now
---
Plant some tato, corn, and mutfruit. You can craft vegetable starch at the cooking station which is scrapped into adhesive. 
---
As another commentor said, you’re only going to get yourself banned on this sub. Your best bet is to contact Bethesda directly and slowly work your way through their system/process. Trying to crusade against them here will only get you the wrong attention. 
---
I did not have sexual relations with that woman
---
XBOX One. When grouped up with a friend, we both go in and out of being completely invisible to each other. Sometimes we can see name plates but often we cannot. 
---
That's the idea, I hope Bethesda uses mine and everyone else's criticism to build something even better next time.
---
Show me on the doll where the bad man hurt you.
---
Didn’t know Frank Reynolds play Fallout. Nice. 
---
The gun is real and my dumbass scrapped it on accident when scrapping all the weapons I picked up along the way FML. I’ve see posts claiming you could get the plan as a rare drop from events in the cranberry bog but I haven’t tried real hard to get it.
---
you're confident that Bethesda coded a bug-free detection system that's intricate enough not to false flag?
---
I'd be surprised considering big tech companies can't come up with a solution like that. but Bethesda of all names, did.
---
now if only they could stop Rad Worms from messing up my mutations.
---
Heres is why you got downvoted. MY lvl 120 character does not have small letters. My lvl 35 has found it 5x. RNG and probably based on workshop.
---
What's this.. Thread number 5? Stop spamming and call Bethesda if you're that pissed off.
---
Can't dupe in game anymore; he gotta dupe something somewhere.
---
I'd prefer saved loadouts to be a thing rather than passive perks. Give us like... two to four slots we can save our perk set into and quick swap them. Problem... mostly... solved. 
---
I feel like you have a better chance finding this guy on pornhub.  
---
It wouldn’t be so bad if they just fast travelled and left your team, but they can’t be bothered. They just join, up use you as a free ticket, and then wander off cluttering your screen up with 6 or so missions running at the same time. Then I feel like an ass dropping out of the team like when I leave a real life party really early.
---
Only times I team up with random people now is if we run into each other and it happens organically or someone actually sends an Xbox message asking for help.
---
It is really worth to watch, especially because the theory at the end.
---
I tended to ignore this sub after my interest to this game started to die down due to boredom. But now that I hear that there are rumors going around and everything is angry kinda makes me scared to hop back onto 76. I love the game, despite its broken state. But it's getting hard to hop back on and have some fun when these people exist.
---
Yes everyone needs, You most likely, Bethesda did shit, and deserve ppls like you
---
Worked like a charm!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Don't forget Purified Water. And Green Thumb perk so you harvest more.
---
I always check vendors and paper bags because sometimes peoppe just dont know what they have. Someone traded an Assasins Lever Action Rifle (Explosive) to Harper’s Ferry vendor, and I bought it for $200ish caps. It’s one of my favorite weapons even after the nerf.
---
just found one for sale in the Welch station.
---
😂😂 I feel your pain. I now touch nothing for a few mins. I also don't touch my pip boy for a few mins after that. 
---
I don’t care at this point. It’s not right man. I’m a huge fan and love this game. I’ve spoken out against duping and have never duped nor have I engaged in an activity that could be mistaken for duping. This feels really shitty. 
---
Two words. Cap stash.
---
I like that idea. But only in 76 and out of the regular series. 
---
BoS vendor usually has 2 economy wonderglues in the shelves / counter every day when I do my vendor route, so might be worth looking there?
---
They have the creation logs! Why can’t they prove it before they suspended me?!?! 
---
True I’m just disappointed everyone is quick to pint fingers at people with no evidence at all 
---
I've had 7 scorchbeasts attack me all at once at fort defiance.
---
Stop cheating 
---
Well I don't PvP, since the people who want to do that are either exploring and don't need anyone griefing them, or higher levels with mutations who would destroy me in a few seconds. Not much would be gained either way.   
---
If you have any suggestions on what else there is to do, I'd be glad to hear it.
---
Updated drivers and done as the video said. A very big improvement, though very very minor stuttering. 
---
The Google internet speed test tells me that my internet is very slow... So i'll just assume that the minor stuttering is due to bad internet connection. Thanks!
---
This happens to me almost every damn time I log in. I’m sick of it. Okay if the game takes a while to load but I’m getting killed and can’t move. Not an ideal plying experience, to put it mildly.
---
Actually its not a fact. From what I've seen no one has provided proof that they did not dupe and had gotten banned. Also, bethesda made a post to debunk these lies. According to their post you would have to be holding hundreds of thousands, in some cases millions of items to be banned.
---
Hey infinite_worm, why are you spamming variations of the same post minute after minute? Don't expect any serious responses if this is how you act 
---
It's probably in the code because it's leftover from 4, this game wasn't built from scratch, it's built off 4. That doesn't mean they'll never do anything with it but I don't think it guarantees anything in the future either.
---
The plans for the bos mod
---
&gt;This game is, has been, will always be — amazing and my pick for game of the year. No internet troll will ever change that.
---
--- /u/Infinite_Worm, 2019 
---
Enough with the hysterics. Even as someone who enjoys all the drama around this game, your spam is pathetic to read. What you got is the fanboy's reward. Maybe it will teach you to hold up a company such as Bethesda to some standards, instead of mindlessly adoring it. For now, enjoy getting dumped on by them and by this "loving" community. Maybe you'll be a footnote in one of those ebil utuber videos you hate so much, but that's about it.
---
No!!!! Oh man :( that's nearly the saddest thing I've ever heard. And yah, I'm grinding those events when I can. Keep getting non legendary combat armor. 👍
---
Bc I’m very upset
---
Just saying that calling someone out, posting their ingame name and calling them names, when you don't know for sure is a bit extreme. Had you tried it, it turned out to be a trap and she killed you, then for sure this would have been the right move. But calling someone out and calling them names when she might have been trying to help you. Sounds a bit unfair...
---
Another 200 to see if things break would be very handy right now!
---
Or maybe those that “can’t manage...” aren’t trying to rush the game and are trying to enjoy the game.  This isn’t a game that requires one to “git gud” and optimize everything to enjoy it.  If rushing to end is what you want you might be playing the wrong game. 
---
Down vote me and live in  your echo chamber and believe that you are the majority voice. 
---
Yeah, I got this a few days ago. Quitting and rejoining seems to fix the problem, but it is still pretty annoying. 
---
This....this is the candidate the voting stations were waiting for.
---
If they turn red you don't get any loot. They just explode.
---
maybe i could have used better wording but my message is the same. they have constantly said they are listening to our complaints but have yet to fix some of the big ones that have been around since launch.
---
I can respect a developer having some big issues in a game if they fix it fast, but with 76 we have had tons of issues that are still here today nearing 3 months since release. the game shouldn't still run like shit and have bugs allowing people to dominate pvp unfairly.
---
Honestly I kinda focus my points toward Strength, Endurance, and Agility when I do melee 
---
I agree. I've had people spam me with team requests, and when I ignored them, they attacked me. 
---
I thought at first they were just trying to get me out of the vendor screen (I had waited in line behind them, they both interacted with the vendor for several minutes each, left the room, and then came back while I was selling). But then they chased me around the Charleston Fire Station and into the parking lot with their level 8 pea shooters, trying to annoy me to death or something. 
---
I doubt sending a "this player doesn't accept team requests" message would have helped there, but...maybe? 
---
Thanks for clarifying the different between hypothesis and theory... I can see why youre a beta tester now! :)
---
If I can, I will provide any info I can for you. Just include me on your hypotheses because it's very interesting. Also, thanks for the compliment!
---
Good point and good idea.
---
how many caps was it?
---
but it is possible...
---
&gt; Bethesda is sending a very clear message that this kind of massive gathering is not going to be tolerated.
---
So it actually has nothing to do with duping, but permabanning people for not playing the game like you believe it should be played.
---
Makes sense.
---
Yes! The slight imperfection nails the theme :)
---
Same here with Gatling guns. Worked perfectly before the patch. Kind of a copycat post, just want Bethesda to know there is now an issue.
---
I've seen the same three... or maybe not, because I killed them already
---
I hate that you were able to turn my own words against me. You are right, atm...
---
Over 600 hours, huh?
---
So you're playing for 8 hours a day, are you?
---
It wasn't a noticeable gain . I'm level 49, so I was probably around level 45-47 2 5 days ago. I remember NOT gaining a level up after I was done.
---
I wanna say 400 but I *really* don't know for sure.
---
For each set of power armor you need a set of calibrated shocks for each side. Each leg piece with calibrated shocks on it can carry an extra 50 lb.
---
Yea, over 600 hours. That one I can prove lol
---
North of Point Pleasant. Haven't been there in ages sonI can't exactly say unless I'm walking about myself.
---
At least, I think that's where it is.
---
Woah woah woah, how the fuck did you get 4k on a melee weapon?
---
Zealot Prime Combat shotgun vs my standard decked out Combat Shotgun. Thought it was me doing something wrong...
---
That makes sense. I've had good luck just charging her in the face with a two hand. She keeps backing up and trying to get away. I thought she just needed distance to attack, but probably just took out her vents as well.
---
I swear they took a tune out of the Whitesprings/Atom Shop 'Lounge Music' rotation. It was my favorite.  
---
I have a +50%vats crit handmade, 30%more damage against robots, and crit meter fills 15% faster. It’s pretty sweet.  I lead with my Bloodied Dragon and switch to that.   Though I’ve found since the patch it doesn’t hit as hard. Could be in my head tough. 
---
?? What bug?
---
Happens every time I log in since I first got the mutation in November.  Glad I could help.
---
Thank you...why endurance?
---
Not from what I’ve seen. Just because Bethesda says one thing doesn’t mean that all of it is true. There are individuals who are incorrectly being punished.
---
oh hell yeah! imma head over to welch!
---
Not me, when I finish my Strip club, it's going to be a classy joint, not like this one, where I have heard the girls get "handsy" with you. I am jealous of their neon letters though; I only have 6500 caps saved up towards them. 
---
Jup, you are right! [https://i.imgur.com/UJ7cgOA.png](https://i.imgur.com/UJ7cgOA.png)
---
The map confuses me every time, cliffs are not marked, ponds and lakes are missing etc. :D
---
Donald Trump plays Fallout 76?
---
I have noticed this problem recently (about 2 days) I have to fight a mob of creatures and by the time I can pick up loot half of the bodies disappeared and I don’t get anything. No idea about scorchbeast queen, to low of a level to confirm that :)
---
Around 6 caps a piece. I eat about 15 per session and give away the extra to low level players, then sell any before it spoils.
---
&gt; Which is a long winded and boring way to say, the behavior patterns of an actual newblet finding a cache of goodies looks way different than a duper trying to money launder their ill gotten gains.
---
The question is whether Bethesda, or perhaps more accurately, some minimum wage paid worker doing this mind numbing work for 8 hours a day actually gives a fuck about the difference. 
---
Given their recent history...
---
Yes please
---
Lol throw it in Mount Doom 
---
Sell junk to vendors 1400 caps a day is your max
---
There is a per level break down at the link.  This is for a non-PA melee build.  Being a mostly STR build, it is very easy to adjust for heavy weapons, 1 handed, 2 handed, or shotgun depending on what drops good for you.  
---
Instigating 2 handed weapons are pretty stout if you play solo, and are just fine for most content at only 1 star.  This build benefits from many mutations.  If you do play solo, you can pick up lone wanderer instead in the charisma category. 
---
Making a melee build is a good idea because of how strong it is right now.  
---
it was definitely not more than 1k. I have 5 charisma and no barter perks, so you might get it cheaper than 400.
---
ok. send a link to these post that supposedly prove they were wrongly banned.
---
Ok one sec. I’ll take a pic and then post it to imgur. 
---
It's not a court of law.  ...and you need to bitch to them,  not to us.
---
Nuke Whitesprings, maybe you'll get a few legend weapons/armor to sell here on Reddit. 
---
I agree. Melee is very powerful and it seems that when you take your very first step into the game, it's a much easier way to handle enemies since the guns are so under powered, ammo hard to find, and VATS is limited.   
---
With everything I described, at level 39, my strength was 21 (15+3 from solar powered+3 from psychobuff). Couple that with Gladiator, Expert Gladiator, and incisor, and I pretty much had my way with just about any enemy for being such a low level. I didn't even need Power Armor since most of my fights were over in one hit. I'm not sure, but my Blade of Batset ignored 30% of my target's armor, so that might have even stacked with incisor.
---
Even if a person was taking there lolly gagging time slow walking through the whole game it could be easily completed in much less time than any other fallout game or other large scale rpg.
---
And look at you wasting time on reddit trying to spark some bs arguments with multiple people on this thread, no wonder you haven’t made it anywhere in the game, BECAUSE YOU WASTE TIME. Git gud man, at time management.
---
Disagree. Best story told in the worst way, we need NPCs. Even if there's only a handful of survivors here and there, even if they weren't there in person but spoke to you over a speaker or through a robot or something, no NPCs at all was a horrible idea.
---
Or even going with the "everyone's dead" route. Reaching Flatwoods and going through the Responder missions could have let you access a live chat with someone in Morgantown. When you get there you find out a few survivors fled onto the next place and so on until you find out in the end they're all dead or something.
---
Not dead from the very beginning, you were just constantly one step behind them.
---
Anything's better than "literally everyone is already dead before you leave the vault and there's absolutely no reason to be invested in anything going forward".
---
And it's a damn shame. Because you can tell they put more time and effort into these characters than any Fallout before it. At least the Bethesda ones. Hardly anyone mentioned is just there, they all had backstories and motivations for being there. Most of them had stories from before the war, too.
---
Well I guess I mislabeled this post if it was intentional. 
---
I just didn't see any specifics in the patch notes regarding 4LC in under perks.
---
Sorry for my  english ( my game is in french ). If you go at bottom right of the map, in the red area, you'll find some red plants, they look like carnivorous plants. When you approach them, they'll open their "mouth" for a few seconds to spread some radiation. You need to quickly interact with them while their "mouth" are open.
---
They give between 4 to 8 adhesives per plants. (You need to go to a workbench or something to transfomr them to adhesives).
---
tl;dr: plants in the red area give a lot of adhesives.
---
Someone should mod a Claptrap voice set over one of the baggage claim robots for this exact purpose.
---
I would pay to hear a protectron make Dubstep music sounds
---
YES! Make special points more important/special. 
---
High int=hacking, luck=better drops, perception=better lockpicks etc. 
---
I craft like 300 boiled water in a row because I don't want to spend time grinding to find water in the middle of a play session.
---
That tends to happen a lot nowadays, huh? I feel like that community is, not only being beaten on the outside by "Fallout purists" (basically those guys who say "New Vegas was the best Fallout! 76 isn't Fallout!"), but it's being corrupted from the inside from people that love to assume terrible things just because they want a leg up over a video game. Like they strive for some kind of false justice, or are doing it to ruin other's fun. It upsets me
---
Does it have live, naked ghouls?
---
I don’t need you to believe me. I’m not going to go spend more time scrolling through posts and etc to try to convince you that I’m right. We can disagree and that’s ok 
---
I don't know why you're being downvoted, it's absolutely true. "TESV: Skyrim" was re-released as Special Edition, Fallout 3 and 4 had quite a few issues... don't get me started on New Vegas.
---
exactly but melee weapons should still be viable. but they can give ballistic weapons some chance for decent damage 
---
This bug again! A buddy of mine back near start would do this all the time! (As did a lot of people.) Duplicating Power Armor and selling it off. Xbox has group posts so it was super easy to do.
---
you can downvote me all you want, I am simply speaking the truth. this company has lied before, don't think it's above them to just ban innocent players and be done with it unless the subject gains traction.
---
but even worse than trusting Bethesda would be trusting their ability to code a bug-free, reliable piece of software.
---
Ty, that’s why I keep saying I hope it doesn’t happen to you. Bc I was the same. I thought “there’s no way you’re gunna get banned if you never duped” them the reports of innocent accounts started happening and I was still skeptical. I know better now. I hope this doesn’t happen to you. 
---
Would love to know as Well since im always low on aluminium
---
Thanks! also your english is perfect! 
---
You can. Log into the game on the character you want to change the photo for, go to the photo gallery, and hit the Make Profile Photo button. 
---
The vault 76 badge photo frame will also update with your character's level in photo mode too.
---
Yeah...I don't know if I believe this company after it told us that canvas is some kind of legendary material. 
---
this will help a lot! thanks
---
I’ve gotten my base destroyed and raged at the person who did it. Now I’m like him. You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. 
---
rad worms is messing up mutations. sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.
---
one thing is completely unrelated to the other, but Bethesda being Bethesda somehow managed to break both.
---
If picking strength, make sure to spread points between slugger, expert slugger &amp; master slugger. (Or gladiator version for 1h) maximises each 10% bonus instead of spending 3 points on a 20% bonus.
---
Lmao. Exactly what I thought you would be a great lawyer. 
---
From what I'm reading, I'm not putting my things at zero caps anymore. I recently traded with this dude, he made me go second to prove he's not a scammer. Then later, I asked him if he can put a mod on a weapon that I had, he did it and gave it back. Not everyone is bad but I'm going to take precautions now based on these comments.
---
Proof
---
Can you show us the screen saying you're banned?
---
yawn
---
Yes. The idea between limited stash was that the server can't track too many items *in the world" at once.
---
Putting items away in some long term storage / or other characters should not impact the performance of the world if done correctly.
---
I use whatever weapons I pick up with good legendary effects but am happy to craft or mod something to replace it. I might have an upgrade you need at least.
---
But yeah I appreciate you dispersing some of the BS we have to deal with on the sub every day.
---

The handmade plans are at some vendors all the time now. Watoga train station will always have it low.
---
I would say it's a great quest, except for the fact you cannot blow those fucking robots to hell when you're done with it.
---
Bethesda reddit account officially stated you will not get banned for crafting items piles of items. So I don't know how true or untrue it is. Gotta have proof recording mass crafting and ban.
---
Hey have they removed ultracite armor plans from the loot table?  (Not including mods).  
---
Haven't done her since the patch yet, wondering if there's any point since all I usually get is ultracite plans.
---
You really have no idea what you’re talking about. That analogy is entirely false as well. What you’re talking is about is me finding facts to argue with you. You sound pretty ignorant, but that may be a false assumption. I’m sorry you don’t want to see the other side, but so be it.
---
Looking at the esm in xEdit, the percent change goes from 7.5% (rank 1) to 10.5% (rank 2) to 13.5% (rank 3).
---
I'm pretty sure I've looked this up before and it was the same. So if it's changed, it's not because of any changes to the esm.
---
Bugthesda*
---
technically buy returning the game you’re only hurting yourself since you’re getting less than you paid initially back in store credit.
---
if you want to go on a self-initiated hiatus be my guest, but rather than explaining your frustration on this reddit page, you should be emailing Bethesda, and open tickets for wrong fully being banned. By explaining your situation, and if it turns out to be true, then congratulations you got unbanned.
---
Also, there’s no reason to get Lady Devann involved because she’s only a community manager. what is she going to do? tell the devs??? your best bet is to take it up higher in the hierarchy.
---
The DMV in my town is more efficient than the one in fallout 76
---
Lol thats Bethesda
---
These subs are usually filled with non-technical gamer-only types, lacking basic understanding of game and software development processes. It is futile to argue with them most of the time. They probably don't know that a game engine just like any software can grow and become something completely different over time.
---
Disappointed that i didn't get to see the inside!
---
I only did a couple test salvo's before scrapping.  Do you recall if the scatter impact zones maybe?  My recollection from early on was.just stacking impacts.
---
I dunno man. I get alot better of a feeling by helping someone level up, building their base, crafting their PA, and giving weapons out than I do levelling someone's hard work. 
---
🤣😂🤣
---
Can someone please make a sticky thread for all the "why I quit fallout" posts. It's the same story over and over.
---
Honestly I hated how you had to kill multiple queens to learn how to make a set of armour the game gives you for free let the queen drop plans for mods for the armour but give us the base plans from a terminal because thats how you get X01 and excavator
---
I also did this back when I was like level 20 I wish they'd let us name power armor chassis already so I don't have to worry about doing it again.
---
That makes sense. I was that way for a while. But it just got boring to me 
---

Anybody who tries to be supportive gets downvoted. I’ve seen it happen to people many times and myself today 
---
Lol not me but I wish I did
---
Yes I was multiple perk cards from packs and actually picking some I already have 
---
Given the amount of misinformation around this game which came right from the playerbase, I am very skeptical of all these ban posts. It might be true, it might be bullshit. Truth is we've got no way of knowing for sure. But if someone is going to come on here and act like a screeching five year old about being banned then no one is going to take them seriously and that is what most of the posts I personally have seen have been like. 
---
Well to be more precise,I've been playing since  the 25th of  December and I saw one player with it heh. 
---
How do you expect to document dcs from console. You can't, I don't record or broadcast 24/7 cuz I have a job. You're the one defending  shoddy entertainment. 
---
Btw, grow up and stop harassing people. Spamming my inbox with threats gets you nowhere
---
Warring, cigar-smoking stalactites? I’d watch it. 
---
Screw (for) you. Sincerly, Bethesda
---
This is exactly how I feel. I crafted hundreds of 50 Cal and 2mm rounds last night and no ban. 
---
I have the feeling if I visited this establishment I would rate it 10 stars out of 5
---
❤️
---
stuff like glowing mass isnt instanced and spawns once for everyone to steal off a corpse so i see how it could be abused
---
you jump even higher, and have even more carry weight.  Think "leap small buildings in a single bound". 
---
No no no. I'm sorry, but the reason you're getting the cold shoulder is because you're spamming the subreddit and acting like a child. Grow up.
---
And my right leg on my PA keeps getting unequipped every time I fast travel!

Isn’t easy to just create a new account if really wanted to play the game and move on ?
---
That's what a lawyer does show the facts to the jury in order to prove that the question in mind is either true or false. and clearly you would be a good lawyer /s
---
Can we ban this guy from the sub. Hes just spamming bs without proof. Look at his last 30 threads within the last 30 min. 
---
Is this a game where we try to figure out what you did?
---
Have u ever noticed how u get different weapons from what the enemy was using? I have. Its weird. One minute that scorched had a pitchfork and then it... Gives me a pipe rifle? The neck? Makes no sense....
---
The great thing is that Bethesda would send your key to a different player.
---
Nah there still there got a ton last night 
---
Spent years farming for my ashes of alar still haven't gotten it. Either way sucks but all MMO's have the bait and carrot just some are just presented better than others
---
Methinks you're thanking the wrong person.
---
I've heard all of these claims but I've yet to see any video proof. Usually just a screenshot of an email or something along those lines that could easily be made using a computer. 
---
Woooooosh
---
I made 700 2mm EC and about 100 Halloween Skeleton Costumes. Let's see. 
---
You talk about being primarily melee, why not give ranged weapons a go? I get they're underpowered, but that is just more of a challenge to survive. I too am a level 39 and I still have all sorts of stuff to do. I also play a lot with my brother on the weekends and we either run around doing BS stuff, or help each other doing missions.  You limit yourself to only melee, you are limiting your game play.
---
Also sounds like you are on some lame servers. I just got done playing for about four hours this morning, saw three teams of folks running around and two nukes launched.  You also did not mention the daily events or any of those. I'm assuming you've done them ALL otherwise you are missing out.
---
WHERE AM I!?!? 
---
I think it's in your best interests to find a different game to play for awhile. Developing games takes time, and it's of higher priority to fix the bugs out and about first.
---
But if you craft too much you might get a ban
---
Check Grafton vendor
---
-.- 
---
wooosh
---
I'd be more willing to pay for that than anything in the Atomic Shop.
---
Yeah I figured that would be the case we’ll still have other single player games I bought and never completed  will do that for now 
---
I'm not downvoting anyone with these claims personally but until I see proof I feel like it's hard to believe. Alot of people will just make stuff up to make Bethesda look bad, it happened when the game came out "fake bug reports" and after enough specific questions they talk about stuff that's not possible in game and then deleted the post. 
---
There’s has been a visual bug that shows a “dupe” armor piece when place on frame but it’s just that “visual bug” if you close and open the transfer menu you’ll see it’s gone 
---
Lost my daisy cutter this way as well. My fiance lost multiple armor pieces like you as well. So ridiculous I dont do that event at all anymore because of that 
---
It has been my experience that bags persist till you log out. 
---
No idea about the containers,  but they do persist past you logging out.
---
Not a holotape, but the ending of the diaglog in the miscellaneous random event "Stay and Listen to Miss Nanny's Story" about Little Red Riding Hood was great.

After half a dozen attempts to get through a silo and launch my first nuke. I'm done with this game.

I can play all day without disconnecting or freezing. But I can't go more than 30 minutes in a silo. It's absolutely infuriating considering the amount of resources that go into running a silo solo.
---
Mothman nerfs??
---
Gulpers drop a ton of glue but they’re challenging opponents lol
---
You're right, we can't trust bethesda to competently code something. But I still trust them a hell of a lot more than a couple conflicting stories on this sub. I've crafted hundreds of marine tactical masks for selling in the past month and am not yet banned. I've crafted hundreds of MIRV grenades and am still not banned. I might even try crafting a few hundred knives or leather armor limbs just to further prove that it's fake
---
It isn't the same song from the trailer
---
I have an experience. I put stuff in a container, logged off and back on with another character and it was empty. I put a lot of half decent items in it. Lost them all. Maybe it was the wrong kind of container, or something.
---
I don't know about containers in world but paper bags seem to last at least 20 minutes or so. I've somehow rejoined the exact same server after relogging (no buddy) and found my bag of useless legendaries in the same place I dropped it at Whitesprings.

Don't worry, when there's only 10 people left playing the game because of Bethesda's incompetence, all 10 of you can go back to fanboying constantly.

&gt;Listen you dont have to take my 100% word for anything ... you can take googles though, I only named a little out of many ways people got banned unfairly, So before you hate please research
---
If you did your own research you'd know you don't get banned for crafting [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a\_note\_on\_banning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/)

Same on PS4. After the loading screen goes away I wait for a minute more, watching the lighting and shadows form in front of me and my CAMP pop up piece by piece.
---
"It just works"
---
Completely understandable. I'm going to make a video of crafting a stupid amount of stuff today and see what happens. 
---
I agree and disagree with this, I would like to recycle duplicate cards that were recieved from card packs.
---
I would like a merger of the perk system from fallout 4 and 76 where we have passive perks (hacker, lock pick, aqua boy/girl, and other non combat perks that only allow you to interfere with the environment) are always on or require no points to use, other perks like added weight, HP, AP, and aggressive/combat perks you have to always shuffle. 
---
I feel that this would allow a more easier build on our characters as in other fallout games I would have the ability to hack and lockpick anything and everything, and play as a sniper with shotgun and 10mm for close combat. In 76 I've found a TSE shotgun and I've been using that for 3 weeks and I've haven't been having issues.
---
Ditto for tesla, plus side is they are ballistic so the AP stuff works on them.
---
World container, same server worked for me before..
---
I'd try it with something that you don't care about losing first though. They may have patched that because that's how some people duplicated

I know this is an older post but to answer your question about mutations is that yes, you have to get enough rads for a mutation and then put on Starched Genes to keep it.  The painful part is that doing so is RNG so you'll get a random mutation you'll need to either RadAway and hope it's the mutation you don't want or my preferred method is find a place with the rad removal chamber.  Also, the removal of the mutation is also random and not the last mutation no matter which method you use.  Once you get a mutation you'll need to wait something like 30 minutes before you can get another one or just server hop to reset the timer.

It can be good for random loot and xp farming and some gear on the side. But if you're looking for legendary gear farming specifically, isn't one of the drawbacks that the drops at the Club aren't often max level? Compared to some of the other places or events that might have less legendaries but they're max level drops....  
---
I would like to see some more Golf Club zones around the map of various levels, so ppl that are lvl 10, 25, 35, 45/50 have things to grind and try getting level related drops and things of that nature.

Ultracite is fairly easy to acquire though. Or atleast. It is for me, i run around servers farming the fissure sites and the final brotherhood area. Can net around 750 in a few hours. Still no where near the amounts the op said... but still a decent sum, to which Ill sell to vendors and players.

The only daily event I never did was powering Poseidon. Tried that one three times and one time my team got hopelessly lost, and twice it bugged out on us.  
---
I do have some guns - namely a sniper rifle that does 70 damage and a single action revolver that does 65. I used them for a bit, but melee is so much easier and effective to me that it seemed pointless when my Blade of Batset does 118 to 148 of damage, ignoring armor, depending on the time of day and what chems I'm using.  
---
It does seem that the servers I join do seem lacking, I'm not sure how the game handles which one it assigns you to. 
---
Unless you duped it enough to have 500,000 copies, you're not going to get banned.
---
Gatling gun is good
---
the rest are mediocre to terrible, explosives and energy weapons break extremely fast, and ammo for them is heavy, but they do deal tremendous damage in the few seconds you get to fire them before they disintegrate.

I’m afraid to use mods atm, but hopefully they’ll adopt it natively in the near future.
---
Agreed, but Bethesda can't put much effort into endgame content until they get the bugs under control. Unfortunately each patch seems to introduce another two bugs for every one it fixes, so it could be a while before we see any new meaningful content. Sure, there are pvp servers coming, but I have no interest in that. 
---
I have three, extremely rare drop and the plans are even rarer. Fun gun that desperately needs slight buffs.
---
I quit a month ago after having only minor hope the game would turn itself around and I could return.  Still watching from the sidelines and it doesn't seem like I'll be returning anytime soon.  Sad to see Bethesda has gone radio silent and shows exactly how Hines and Todd really feel about the game if they can't even defend it publicly after such a hype train.
---
I have a theory, but no real evidence that Graham spawns in as an event (maybe event is the wrong word). All over the map there are points, usually on roads and rail lines, that when you cross over them a random event occurs, usually you get attacked by some kind of enemy. The event doesn't necessarily occur at the point, but sometimes further down the rail or road from the point. I try to cross over the points I know about when I am traveling and have seen Graham about 9 times, in hundreds of hours of play, in several places not on that map, like on the train tracks between Morgantown and Grafton. A couple of times I have seen him materialize in just like an event. There are people, like modders, that could probably dig into the games files a tell for sure. It would be awesome to have a list of what events can occur at what points.
---
Were you kicked in the ass by Bethesda to write this post?
---
Kill a bunch of scorched or super mutants, take all their weapons, and sell them to vendors. Run them completely out of caps. Wash, rinse, repeat.
---
Highest possible right now is 4 star. 3 star machete with the sacrificial blade mod added, adds 1 more. 
---
I have a 4* machete and that’s the highest you can get for now. 
---
Better than 90% of the drops in this game, You at least get to use it, and if not you can fetch about the same price at shops. 
---
I always like to drop a fertilizer resource at my friends places. 
---
They're always annoyed at first but then they fall in love with the brahmin and end up keeping it. 
---
Somewhat agree, that pretty sums up the game, but people are hardly getting banned in the droves and huge numbers and probably except a few most bans are deserved. It won't be hard to spot a duper or someone glitching/exploiting vs someone playing the game normally. 
---
That been said, the game is both fun and frustrating, but still worth your time and playing if you enjoy it. Just because there no human NPC's doesn't make it less of a fallout game, maybe a bit less fun and dry, but there are many other mechanics in the game that make up for it and I am sure eventually more content and updates will come and make the game more enjoyable (I hope). If not we will move onto other games and it will die .. I certainly have got my money worth and is just a big time waster for me.
---
The current \[max\] issue is the most frustrating and annoying thing for me, I get it is in place to curtail dupers, but at the same time is impacting legit players in a very negative way. Anyway it is what it is .. not giving up just yet, but I am heading in that direction. Might give RDR2 another try.
---
Build your camp on a junk pile way easier than farming. Otherwise microscopes. Morgantown High School has a room full of them maybe 6?
---
I've seen that before. There's a bunch of cat pictures inside
---
OK I'll have search, when you say easily do they advertise here somewhere, a market? Never used anything like that.
---
Haha such long wording to convey the most basic information that we already know.  
---
GT?
---
*"I once knew a guy who's motto was 'Love thy neighbor'. He lived next to a brothel!"*
---
First load-in is to check your camp location to see if it can be placed, I believe.
---
Why should we pay for that??
---
Have you tried connecting a terminal to them? I know it works for the flat square lights.
---
I'm with you and I agree posting about it on a public forum to share the dislike for the game is justified.  This was a cheap cash grab from Bethesda and they knew it.  It's going to cost them in the long run unless they pull some sort of FFXIV rebirth of this game (Unlikely since they made it clear that cost was more important than content and play ability).
---
So it was a challenge?  My husband plays God of War and I’m pretty sure there are some enemies there that disappear and reappear too.  
---
Did this shitty patch to a shitty game also put all vendors in the same cap pool or something?
---
do I have too put the custom file read-only
---
Yes since "cheating" in a broken game that still can't get its shit together after almost 3 months is such a mortal sin. It's on PS4 so all they were doing was duping which effects no one and has been fixed for the most part thanks to the patches that also basically made them drop everything. They shouldn't be banned in the first place since it was all in game issues. It's not like they used a 3rd party tool to actually cheat the game.
---
But yet... you're still here. *scratches head* doesnt make much sense eh?
---
I had something similar happen to my combat rifle a while ago, the game literally loaded all my ammo on the mag displaying 999/0 and I could shoot forever without having to reload. I relogged a couple of times but it didn't solve it, also a full day later it was still there, and somehow it just fixed itself when I fast traveled.
---
I hope they get a box of doughnuts that are NOT their favourite flavour, but have no choice but to eat them :D
---
Thank you all for the help
---
Todd Howard here, We here at Bethesda noticed an alarming trend in player retention, in order to correct this trend we have implemented a soft cap to the player count on all servers with the latest patch; Harper's Ferry is just one of the locations designated with this patch. We hope you enjoy this new feature as well as our commitment to player satisfaction. 
---
I totally get what you're saying and you're right. We shouldn't have to use mods for QoL stuff that should have been common sense to put in the base game, but sadly it's still a Bethesda game and Bethesda games (almost) always need mods to fix them.
---
Is it an Easter egg if it's not a reference to something though? 
---
This is, like many little dioramas in the game just a cool thing to to stumble upon but not really an Easter egg I wouldn't say. 
---
I dunno, I visited every single location, read every note and listen to every holo. I finished my last quest around lvl 70 and around 100 hours. All other fallout games had much more content. Also 76 has the disadvantage of sectioning content by level. So once you get to that point there is nowhere you can even farm or go though except the right 1/5 of the map. I played f4 for 400 hours and still discovered new things, not the case with 76. It desparately needs more end game content. A new game+, rades, better system for attaining legendaries (99% of drops are complete trash), incentives to group, something. Basically there is 0 end game and you do not have to rush to be there now, by any means.
---
How many? 
---
Most excellent!
---
This would have so much exploits though and duping
---
Not that Ive see. Its either fury or overdrive. Then some other drug in pill form
---
Yeah - I could care less about that store.  I'd pick up something when I had enough in game to purchase.  Beyond that - no real money would come out of my pocket (if I was still playing I mean).
---
I have not been able to play with team all day today. I can join a team but when I click play with team it sits there Loading...for about a minute then connection failed timed out while waiting for server to respond. Really a bummer. 
---
One clearly is better looking than the other.  That said, they both look stupid, it's just a matter of degree.  What purpose do melon size shoulder pads serve, a collar halfway up your head, fat suit thighs, dinner plates for knee guards and boots wide enough for two?
---
Go to fort defiance (the former allegenhy asylum) and search for straight jackets. In one run I got 18 but sometimes the place is picked over. Spawns are random so sometimes you’ll find random nurses outfits.
---
There’s a couple more at the state penitentiary, plus about 16 prisoner collars.
---
Go to the civil war cemetery and look for civil war suits and hats, and union and confederate uniforms. There’s a few more at pricketts fort, and at the museum at Helvetia.
---
There is also a rangers suit and hat at fort prickett and several other parks venues, and the watchtowers across Appalachia.
---
Go to the crashed space station, search for spacesuits and helmets. The code is 111418
---
All over whitespring are golfers outfits and skirts. All over top of the world and other venues nearby there are ski suits and hats.
---
All these clothes are .1 lbs so you can gather, server hop and get quite a stash. 
---
Then sell at the different vendors: Responders, Raiders, Whitespring, Enclave, Watoga (which shares a pool with Graham and the traveling vendor bot), BOS vendor also in watoga, and the Free States vendor in Harpers Ferry.
---
If you find anything marked clean keep it. Some people will pay big bucks for clean items, which are very rare. But only if you trust the vendor player system. 
---
There’s also a convoluted unmarked quest that will net you some nuka world outfits. Worth less than some of the other outfits but if you combine with bottle cap glasses that spawn anywhere sunglasses do, someone might be willing to pay extra for the ensemble. That same quest will net you plans for T-51 nuka world power armor paint - maybe someone will pay you to paint their armor. 
---
 Todd Howard here, We here at Bethesda noticed an alarming trend in player retention, in order to correct this trend we have implemented a soft cap to the player count on all servers with the latest patch; Nuke zones are just one of the locations designated with this patch. We hope you enjoy this new feature as well as our commitment to player satisfaction. 
---
 and then you use the go to of bitches everywhere XD
---
well if friendly friend  said there were false bans, hold me bruthers.
---
You can move SPECIAL points around when you hit level 50 - once per level up.
---
When you reach a new level, from 50 onwards, you're given the option to unlock a new perk card (or level up one you already have) or move a SPECIAL point.
---
Just had to say rdr is download and am excited especially for 11$
---
all of these post have zero proof. its just people jumping on the bandwagon. Bethesda has also made a post responding to these liars.
---
im still baffled how this game has legitimately no end game
---
not even 1 fucking dungeon to grind
---
Explain?
---
I have to agree - I stuck it out for a bit, but I bailed a month ago after not seeing any major improvements.  Watching for it to get better, but the dumpster fire appears to just keep getting full can's of gasoline thrown on the fire.  Why NERF things when the game needs all the encouragement to play it anyways?
---
Such a waste of resources right ?
---
Didn’t even manage to make a decent damage 
---
Combination of perks, mutations and +str gear. Damage mitigation at low health is great I might add.
---
Honestly, there you have it. You're playing a character that is strong enough that the game is not a challenge. I know that sounds lame, but it's like playing on God Mode. What's the point?
---
I don't believe there is any real logic behind server assignment. For the most part you are assigned to a server in your region, and some games try to find a balance of the players skills. Meaning if you are a level 10, they wont put you in a server full of level 100s. You'll get a mix of low, mid and high level players.
---
There has been many people across the community complaining about this problem but Bethesda hasn’t helped them. Supposedly if you mass craft weapons or aids the game flags you and bans you because it thinks you’re duping. Thus Bethesda temporarily bans your account and gives you four days to appeal the ban, but they are so slow in the appeal your account may be permanently banned on a false claim. 
---
I’m making a note of this idea, and saving it for when I level up enough.
---
I think I have a mod for it?
---
Good thing melee isn’t over powered then. 
---
Keep me posted. 
---
You want us to sit through a video that is over an hour long you better give us some context man. 
---
Yeah or a 3star gun with a scorched killer receiver
---
So you’re saying you know the feeling of having your shit destroyed but you never once thought of how that person was likely experiencing the same feels while you destroyed his camp?
---
What you have described is a total lack of empathy and I would imply that you were likely a destroyer from the beginning. Destined to be a asshole of the wastes.
---
Both are a problem, the bugs would get in the way of enjoying new end game content. 
---
another sad attempt  from the duper pr department.
---
If it’s happening to multiple people for over a month now [proof](https://youtu.be/LYTU80dD_Mw) enough? I’m mean that many people can’t be lying. 
---
Plus they make for good eatin’!
---
I didnt think fog crawlers were a supposrd rare sight, they used to spawn outside my camp all the time when i had it place near the top of the world near a cliff
---
Just based on those examples everyone would put their specials into luck. It’s one of the only things that matter especially end game.
---
Or.....wait for it....get rid of perk cards and go back to the fallout 4 level system because perk cards are annoying and a pain in the ass
---
I can mod yours for you if you want. Before the latest patch the Grafton station had them from server hops. I haven’t seen it there since the update tho
---
Oakmechanical

2) SlingHippo
---
4) No enemies would target me after acquiring a bounty of 20 caps by damaging another players c.a.m.p while fighting mongrels. Regardless of attacking enemies, they would never target me but there was one exception - hit super muntants with frag grenades and one targeted me. The issue persisted afterwards in spite of fast traveling and traveling great distances by foot. This could be gamebreaking and/or become a serious exploit
---
Oh arenanet has its fuck ups no doubt. I got banned recently because someone was making purchases through xbox on my card (dont own an xbox) so my bank revoked all gaming purchases and anet banned me for fraud, however within 24 hours of explaining the situation to them (and to ps4 support) I got it back plus 3k gems for the troubles. 
---
Onto bethesda. Got banned a while back for having a carry weight exceeding 2k over my limit. I explained to them that I pick up everything I come across and then sell it to vendors and players. "Yeah well thats cheating, contact us again and you'll be perm banned" 
---
Overall. Id trust anet any day over bgs. 
---
There was at least one version in one of the trailers thats different, but i dont know about changes to the in game version because i dont listen to the radio in game
---
Purposeful deceitful or willingly ignorantl ....because I expected 20 + 3 to equal 23....wow mate you must be a genius to have figured me out so well based on one math equation.
---
Can’t they? What with the hate train that’s currently happening? Noooo, of course not. Now go on, have another bowl of naive flakes.
---
Don’t know what you’re talking about. Let me rephrase for you to make it easier to understand. 
---
Someone destroyed my base. I raged at him and said he was a jerk. He said it’s pvp. It’s in the game. He said I had to deal with it
---
Time passes
---
I am bored of everything. What isn’t boring is destroying people’s bases. I know how it feels to be on the receiving end. But hey. It’s pvp. Deal with it. 
---
You can get falsely banned if the game thinks you’re duping when really you’re mass crafting. Some people just make a bunch of the same weapon to scrap to get mods from it but the game doesn’t know any better. Thus false claims. 
---
It's not just crits that don't contribute. If you use a auto rifle, fire a crit, all normal shots following do not build the meter back up. So you have to drop vats and open it again to start building your crit meter. 
---
So glad I bought them off of someone for 2k before the patch
---
You can respec one point every level past 50. 
---
So that was yoooou!!!!
---
That many people is one douchebag with multiple accounts .  Cheater
---
How many is that?
---
I called bullshit on it a few hours ago. Turns out it was. The state of gamers today! 
---
Amazing! I'll try it out.
---
Butcher Pete doesn't play very often at all for me 😛
---
And a late night "ghoul and radstag" show, for the right price 😉
---
My tse still goes over 400 with the right perks devastating for one enemy before it was the whole crowd lol 
---
actually no that's not proof. It's not happening to people for over a month now. It's people claiming they got banned for over a month now. Most of these people are probably dupers themselves hoping that more posts like these will get bethesda to revert bans
---
I'm using the civil war era suit and black cowboy hat, just to be different from everyone with the western duster. It fits better with the black cowboy hat anyway.
---
Also, does anyone have a picture of the sniper hat on a male character? I've seen pictures of the sniper outfit itself on a male character(which looks silly since it's a female outfit), but they didn't have the hat equipped in said picture.
---
Where abouts does the plan spawn, just moved my camp, plus is it a set plan or is it random? 😂 
---
Haven't we already heard that this is coming?
---
[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/acvptm/wip_i_made_a_visual_catalog_matching_camp_assets/). Someone made a picture catalog of all the furniture plans.
---
13% is in no way worth 3 points. Glad I didn't try this one out.
---
I try to see the best in people and there is a possibility some of them are telling the truth. We can’t just disregard people in the off chance some of them are fake. 
---
I'm not sure what that means, but the point of my prior comment was it seems like you are awfully keen on being hurtful in your comments, so I am just inquiring why that is so.  You could have a constructive conversation about it, but rather you chose a method of attacking and belittling.
---
Me replying to your asinine statements is hardly complaining. 
---
problem is I have found probably 50 suits recently and I have multiple sets of everything else I just seem to have some terrible luck with that missing arm.
---
And the cycling lights 
---
&gt;everything that made a good fallout game
---
Everything?
---
Amen.
---
i agree, remove all legendary effects. i remember pvping on day 1 and 2... it was so much fun when there we ZERO legendaries. no invisible snipers 1 shotting, no explosive weapon weilding jetpack using scumlords, just you and a 10mm with a baseball bat... against a guy with a shotgun and a board.... 
---
You can have animals at your camp? How fo you do that? 
---
I can’t say for sure since I haven’t received the emails myself, but also people talking about this subject can get their post taken done or banned. So I’m not sure how much are out there since they are trying to be hidden away. 
---
Maybe drops matter more end game, but having a balanced SPECIAL is more enjoyable for actual players.  
---
Nobody posts proof with there claims. I don't take Bethesda's word blindly but it does at least build a little confidence I wont be banned for crafting. If someone wants to back up there claim I would be listening, just too many trolls trying to tarnish Bethesda's name because they think they got banned unjustly for "using a in game exploit".
---
So not many, ok then.
---
Not my place but I got mine in watoga (not train station) before the last patch. Not sure if they are still there. Paid about 8400 with maxed vendor perk and 15 cha. 
---
People will say they do it when they get bored of the game. This is just an excuse for being a dickhead. It’s like saying “I just troll people cause I’m bored”, no John, you’re just an asshole with no life or friends.
---
I’ve played this game an insane amount of hours, and never once did I think, hey I’m gonna go start ruining other people’s day to make my day more fun!
---
Not to mention what exactly is supposed to be fun in the act of destroying a persons camp while they stand there defenseless? Nothing. They are only getting the fun from the reaction or impression they made on to you, your grief is their fun, and people who find other people’s grief to be fun to them, are just assholes, who will eventually in life regret the sad loneliness of everyone hating them and having no friends or anyone who gives a fuck of their existence.
---
Looks like it's a bug if you have 2 of the same type of weapon favorited. Keeps happening to my 2 gatling guns, and my 2 Lever Action guns (2 different chars)
---
Todd Howard here, We here at Bethesda understand your frustration in being unable to find the end game content, but we believe we have provided sufficient end game content in the form of atomic shop items. For many time is a valuable resource so we strive to provide accessible content to our entire player base. 
---
No, I don't think they count for anything.
---
Wow, that's something I had completely misunderstood. thanks a lot for the clarification :) that's relaxing to know
---
They did acknowledge it in one of their recent posts. They understand the desire, but there are design considerations that they have to figure out first.
---
For example, an event where you need to defend something, might have 15 minutes left, but the thing is at 1% health. So just the timer isn't really a good indicator of event status in all circumstances. 
---
Flat square lights? 
---
holy shit thanks
---
Sweet! Looks like a pretty solid bunker, thanks for the pics!
---
Problem was they two shot and explosive were drastically better then other legendary effects.  Zero hope of balancing while such things are around.
---
You want to hear screaming, wait for them to tone down melee.  My money is dropping the damage bonus from STR stat since it's overshadows the melee perks.
---
Ehh, personal preference and all, but it really is better than it seems. Especially if you use a weapon with a higher rate of fire (such as the Handmade rifle) to build up crits.
---

4. For the past few days, I've been unable to repair or modify my power armor. I place the suit in the stand, but nothing happens when I try to repair.  The scrap function still works.  Logging out / re-logging does not help.

He's in hiding 
---
He theorizes that Fallout 76 was originally supposed to be single player until someone suggested a multiplayer part of it and that consumed the game.
---
Ok. Have fun!
---
I can craft you one for 100 caps and your resources
---
Pistols could really use some oomf. As far as meta play, there’s no reason to use a pistol over a rifle. Perhaps have the damage up close be significantly higher with a steep fall off?
---
Add me, I’ll fight you till you have 0 caps
---
To put it simply.. "Mad cuz Bad" and the classic "git gud"
---
Yeah, I don't even know where to get that many screws
---
TBH I found the game a lot more fun when I did that myself.  Sub 50 combat just flows better with fewer bullet sponges.
---
Fuck plans, I'll spend all my caps here. 
---
dude i love this idea
---
Based on Bethesda's wording " In some rare cases, accounts with as few as 150,000 of one of these items collected inside of 30 days have been banned after coming to our attention via being reported by other players" If you picked up "collected" the dupers rare items, then the duper reported you and Bethesda checked your account and saw the massive amount or rare items in your history, you could be banned.
---
Will be added later. I imagine the same time as higher lvl items above 50
---
:(
---
Really? Man, I guess I’ve just been in the wrong areas then, been playing since day 1 basically (pretty casually tho, I like building camps) and only saw one so far but was too low to kill it
---
I asked for a PVP mode.  
---
PS4 PRO.
---
demolition perk not apply 60% to explosive weapons. 
---
Base weapon damage randomly changes.
---
Melee weapons go through enemy making a hit sound but no damage done.
---
These all happen without any negative buffs or disease.
---
Thanks for looking
---
Don't think we've got specifics, just that they're coming, for all we know they might not even be end game.
---
That's dumb as fuck considering fallout 4 was single player and they made a multi-player game out of THAT. It was never supposed to be a single player gamer and part of it multi-player.  
---
One hour video for that at the end? Nice try
---
Worst case, the person who presses the "ban" button may be minimum wage and bored, but the person would handle the appeal likely is a better paid higher level admin.
---
When I worked in server hosting, Level 1 security could ban you, but level 2 admin and security supervisor handled unban requests.
---
Lol this is great
---
Maybe just plain ignorant then? Idk how many times I have to say the words balancing mechanic before you understand whats going on. Its very clearly a balancing mechanic and I hope they raise the unattached weights to shut you idiots up at your own deficit.
---
How many screws does it need ? Can't be that bad .. 
---
Aren't you the guy who got banned for picking up duped items? And you now blame it on "craft too much" on another reddit post. What a hypocrite.
---
I have crafted over forty fire axes in my inventory and walked around with them along with two exact copies of Anti Armor+power attack damage 2 star legendaries. I haven't been banned

He's a game critic who makes long analytical videos on a variety of releases.  He tends to balance his criticism with perspective on what may have been in the developers/publishers mind, or propose alternative improvements of his own.

Thanks for informing us

You ever log in at your CAMP? It still takes a full minute to spawn after you gain faculty in the world.
---
As for towns I'd like to keep my own camp where I have it and I'd like to have my town lot where I can stop by and visit. 
---
In the server that can currently hold I think 25 players you could have 6 towns with a lot limit of 5 in the different regions, let's say you build your lot in the Forrest one day, next time you come in the whole Forrest town is full, that's ok because now your town lot moved to another open space in the world there could be one town per region Forrest, toxic valley, ash heep, savage divide, mire and cranberry bog.
---
When this is implemented I would like to have robot vendors to run my town plot. This will allow your plot and store to be always active while your playing.
---
Also your town plot/store is built with a god mode so to speak. Meaning whatever you build in your plot will NOT get damaged by other players/NPCs/or any enemies. This would prevent people greefing on your store/town plot. 
---
That's just my two caps worth of ideas to make towns more balanced. 
---
You can still eat meat and you will get the bonus any recipe provides regardless if it's meat or plant, but if you're Herbivore you get 0% food benefit from meat and 0% food benefit from plant based recipes if you're Carnivore.

 Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda apologize for your unsatisfactory experience with Fallout 76, but would like to remind you that our spam inbox is full and that all other support request are being 'taken care' of by unpaid Indian interns. 
---
Did u read the wiki? pretty sure info on there is wrong. let me check in game. give me 10 min 
---
Have you crafted them all at once because that’s when they say if happens. One said he created ~30 gamma guns in one go to scraps them for mods but got banned a bit after. 
---
Then watch the video and see for yourself.
---
Ohh yes I noticed the carrywight  however I also get healing factor and marsupial not working at all. How do you know it’s due to radworm. 
---
I don't pvp at all , I always play in pacifist mode. I just never cared for pvp in any game. If I accept a random team invite it's possible that the player may have claimed a workshop or in some other way flagged themselves for pvp. 
---
It took me several times reading this sub to discover how exactly pacifist mode works. Here I learned that pacifist mode doesn't work if you claimed a workshop or are on a team with someone that has . So I quit taking invites once I found this out . I've got no desire for any pvp at all. So I'm sorry if you think that's rude, I'm chilling.
---
It's posts like these that i come to reddit for.  You are a good person.  Thank you for brightening my day.

You don’t know what empathy is? I can’t say I’m not surprised.
---
And I had no confusion in your explanation as it was just a sad excuse for justifying the enjoyment you find from ruining other people’s experience of the game.

You’re toxic, find a hole, sleep in it
---
have you set up a vegtable starch farm at your camp?
---
If they’re going to make plans cost 3500 then I agree wholeheartedly with the statement!

I'm a little surprised they haven't been doing simple themed events for cosmetics or something.  Even the old school community challenges like me3 had would be quite welcome.
---
Orange man bad

I don't doubt the moderators forward information to BGS
---
LadyDevAnn post regularly. For her to not at least skim post titles / upvoted titles would be negligent on her part towards BGS and the community; in addition, this would be outside industry standards.

You stated,"No they Don't" That is a pretty definitive statement to make!

Do you have special access to this sub-reddit or BGS I don't know about?
---
I would not be surprised if it was wrong 
---
Thanks for the original and constructive post, we as a whole greatly appreciate it. Your complimentary gift basket will arrive within 3-5 business days

Gw2 Bank is account wide as well. Downside it can get full of shit rather easily.

I'm more for that cowboy ghoul. Or maybe FISTO!

Go to the Sunday brothers camp in the mire by Harper's ferry and pick their garden to plant your own.
---
Honestly, I was expecting this to be one of the first things in the ATOM Store. Basically, you get a standard, starter "pet" in-game, then buy skins for them. Personally, I'd like an eye bot.
---
Thanks for the good laugh while I wait for my burgers to finish up. My neighbor probably thinks I had a stroke. 
---
That is ingenious.
---
How is it not? 
---
Atom have mercy on our souls
---
Come on, with all the faults in the game, let's at least keep politics out of it.
---
Had a guy wanted for like 50 caps last night. Tried to kill him. Failed. He took my loot. Sent him a gg message and he offered me my loot back.
---
Its the only piece I need as well and can’t find it
---
No problem and have fun. 
---
It is so no npc can destroy it
---
Wtf do you mean by "playerbase have always been whiny dicks"? the FO player base is known for many a thing, being whiny dicks is not one of them.  BTW, I've been playing fallout since '97, and I can say they fucked up. I have the game, am a team medic tank, and there is no contet
---
Yeah, but I believe you can from time to time get it from events or toolboxes. 
---
When you’re using this to lure players to you for caps, you’re going to get accusations. 
---
I paid 2.5k. Can't forget the player&gt;player trading.
---
Oooh shit... What's the go to Veggie meal? 
---
Dang duper! 
---
I'll make my own C.A.M.P. with blackjack and hookers!
---
All at once. But have you read the post about Bethesda replying to this claim? I mean people wouldn't just come out and say they were duping and say "okay I deserve my ban", they would try to get the ban appealed
---
The running theory is that there is a 0 missing at the end of that ammo amount. I'm inclined to agree and wish they would fix it soon. Until then I suggest using the plasma flamer and turning your enemies into goo.
---
U/todd_thelord_howard what's your take on this? 
---
Nice missile launcher! Let's call that... 25 caps? 
---
The fact it can be anyone... If they have ill intent, they now have your CAMP location...
---
No thanks
---
That coming from a /r/FellowKids subscriber is just funny. Didn't expect any less from someone who plays fallout76 and defends its devs. People like you are the only reason devs like bethesda rips off players and ruins good franchises.
---
Well the fact that they are not responding to any of these post in proof in itself. Even if they were reading reading and just ignoring these that right there shows they don't give a shit about these 'leaving the game' posts
---
you can get 22 caps from the stump stash in flatwoods and 60 some caps in the stash at the black site in sugar grove(the key for the call is in huntersville). If you have the cap collector perk sometimes it doubles.
---
After digging around I found that the amount you have to create is extremely high for any ordinary player to do. Also new information came out so I’m reading on it now. 
---
Totally agreed. Been using pistol build since I started. I love it. My damage output is weak. I’ve found the best way to mitigate it is by focusing on crits. High AGI and LCK make all the difference. I got my hands on a +50% VATS crit damage &amp; -30% VATS AP cost on a single action revolver. Too bad it’s a single action.
---
I wish there was nuance to the revolvers. Right now it’s “fuck it’s not a western revolver”, the indisputable best revolver. The single action could have a fan the hammer function for a mega fast damage output. Of course, BGS won’t put the funds in to make a new weapon animation :(
---
Pistols could just use a big damage buff as you suggest, OP.
---
/u/todd_thelord_howard what's your take on this?
---
Glad I got them off someone who bought them not realizing they already had it. Dude just dropped them on the ground at the feet of the vendor.
---
I'm scared of how expensive they are after this patch. With some things going from 300 caps to several thousand, is the 25k cap enough for it now?
---
It seemed higher than 13% with my revolver. 
---
Either way, I would get back-to-back crits quite frequently. Occasionally back-to-back-to-back. It was really what saved ammo against scorchbeasts and made me passable for PvP. 
---
I seen the handmade plan at watoga when i was level 51 lol no shit
---
I first saw them when i was like lvl 20
---
Well done. Come back when you are out of your lemming phase ...
---
His message made me think he thought they were cheaper before the last patch upped plan pricing
---
Orange fan sad and mad.
---
Oh. My. Goodness. I swear I’ve searched around and couldn’t find any answers. Thanks! I guess I’ve only ever looked at the photos from the main screen.
---
After almost 500 hours in the game,  I spend most of my time building new camps,  trying new builds,  hanging out with the friends I've made. 
---
Treat it like a fallout game and keep trying new stuff. Make a junkie raider build and see if you like it.  Save min maxing for the upcoming pvp servers,  this is the time for free range fun.
---
I aways get nervous around paper bags now... i walk around them as if they are poisonous sneks... just so (just in case) the person who dropped it or died will know I'm a friendly and I'm not here to take your stuff. 
---
Thanks for sharing that!
---
Only have 2 violet, but I have the cobalt 
---
True. I can enter Support tickets myself if I need to, but it’s preferred that the client do it directly. That way they can put it in their own words with their perceived impact. Plus, if additional information is needed, it’s easier if there isn’t a middle-man in the way. 
---
Noted! Feel your pain brother! Lost my sentinel leg to this shit event as well!
---
Yeah I crafted over 200 healing paste in one crafting session plus close to 100 soups of various  types.  Last month I made 40+ throwing knives.
---
Never been banned.
---
TIL, thanks.
---
When I end up with stupid amounts of crafting materials I tend to do this to try and get mods. 
---
Where do you get all the lead?
---
A madlad thats who
---
Todd Howard. I'm glad you responded to this, if indeed it is even is you, because I think you're a lying Punk. At E3 you said this game was ready and obviously it is not. And I pre-ordered to play the beta as promised which was not even a beta it was a server tester and it needed to be longer cuz your servers suck. I am so unhappy being a Fallout fan play them all great stuff. But your decision not to let Stream run this game was wrong. And I know you don't really care you got your money you're doing your thing but thanks for screwing us the fans.
---
Here's my issue: armor seems to be one of the less duped items in the game. I can't compete in trading against dupers for weapons and stuff, but I can with armor. Dupers just wait until they get their RMT notifications from paypal. Meanwhile, my character that acts as an armor vendor who holds all the armor I farmed from whitespring can't accept caps. If you hinder the legitimate economy and demand is unmet, then the only players left in town are the dupers. 
---
The weight limit is fine, but let me sell off my leftover stock for caps.
---
S'ole me words from me mouth....aarrrrghh.
---
Yeah, it's been a feature for a while now
---
Maybe Bethesda helping them ? 
---
Soldier boy: “helping them ?” 
---
This has been disproved already. They’re lying Bethesda went through the process they used for bans. Mostly users with 100s of thousands of rare items procured within 30 days. That’s not possible from just crafting unless all you do when you log on is farm and craft and I highly doubt that any of those people use that play style. Try looking for the threads that say “Bethesda replied...” I can’t remember the specific post 
---
hum
---
Pretty much. The humor is gone. The ability to affect the world is gone. You can be neither good nor evil. You just are. You have no interaction with anything, you are railroaded into whatever it is you start. You can either choose to do action with no consequence or not. It doesn't matter. Nothing has any weight.
---
Bring your own disease cure 
---
Ahhh that's the pattern.  Same for my second .50 cal, gat gun, and gat plasma.
---
This is what's really worrying me about endgame as I get my first character to 50.... those perk packs really just keep coming every 5 levels? I'm already absolutely swarmed with perk cards I either don't use, or copies of ones I already spent levels getting to max rank. What the hell is going to happen with all these cards? Just keep accumulating indefinitely? There has to be a way to get rid of them.
---
I still don't understand the need for a stash increase. 
---
I have triple digits of all the junk that is used regularly, enough space to stash my triple digits excess of purified water from my water farm, and some armour and weapons and still haven't maxed it out ever. 
---
Unless you're hoarding dozens of weapons and armour stash size doesn't seem like an issue.
---

Gota love them laser turrets, when myself and a friend did a silo for the first time we didn't have level 3 hacking
---

---
Well, Trump IS an edgelord, so it's fitting.

Because it's the only fun thing to do in this boring game.
---
A little hard to find still but this works well for me. 
---

---
Oh man I see what you mean now. Hadn't thought of that 
---
Chock full of soup.  Santa could swim down it.
---
That would definitely be mandatory for my daily vendor rounds
---
Depends on weapon and build, but part of the balance is having to close and soaking damage while they do, then eating damage between each target, you can't hide, etc etc.   
---
It's also worth noting not everyone runs around with a SuperSledge..  The comparison to the Sledge/Super would be what a maxed out hunting rifle? Point is the hunting rifle should be epic and it whimpers 
---
I like this. Just give me some way to move stuff between characters. 
---
It's not fun. You might just be an asshole. No normal human likes being an asshole to someone that was nice to them. 
---
Seriously. Allowing sharing between accounts would lighten the load on the servers. Think of all that scrap and stuff people would house on players and not stash boxes. Simple idea to problem.
---
Showed this to my girlfriend and she just laughed and said «boys will always be boys.»
---
Even better, Beat them with a pipe and shout, I AM YOUR GOD NOW
---
Could not agree more..
---
This community is too toxic, obnoxious, and spite filled for an AMA.
---
For every legitimate question (even about issues or game problems) there'd be 500 more that would run the line of "OmGZ Bugthesda why can't you get Todd Howard to get the interns who are the only ones left working on 76 to make new content"
---
What can someone really do? I guess find your camp and trash it worst case scenario
---
I get what youre trying to say but what you described would not change the game at all. You think the game would be better if theres still no npcs, but you can talk to them over comms or something? Being one step behind them is whole other annoyance I would rather not experience. The game takes place only 25 years after the bombs were dropped, life would change instantly. The population would decrease significantly at the moment of detonation and during the
---
 aftermath . It sorta all makes sense, imagine the 25 years before reclamation day, with terminals and holotapes they actually do a good job at showing the hardships and pain endured by the survivors. For me, it gives all the quests and your actions in general more weight and gives me more incentive to do them tbh
---
##DON'T FEEL BAD FOR USING BIG LETTERS. THIS POST WAS BY THE BIG LETTER GANG
---
I didn't t think so either, but I never was disconnected losing progress.
---
That would be cool.  
---
Okay I lost it on this one you got me 😂😂😂
---
I have this issue repeatedly with friends becoming invisible as well. 
---
Ive heard a few, theyre heart breaking at times
---
I got mine for 9800? 
---
&gt;Imo there shouldnt be any weapon damage perk cards...  And instead have weapon damage tied only to the weapon, its barrel, ammo/magazine type, reciever.  
---
As painful as it would feel to lose all my rifleman cards, in all honesty I totally agree with you. Having 9 points of perception dedicated to damage is just so boring, when there are so many cool Perception perks I'd love to play with. But because they exist, I feel obligated to use them, if anything to cut down on ammo usage. 
---
They might have been on a full team 
---
Let's have them fix the game before adding crazy stuff that won't work properly.
---
I didn’t read your entire post, but from what I gathered... a company of scammers banned a scammer on their network. So essentially, if scamming isn’t good enough for Bethesda it shouldn’t be good enough for the consumer.
---
&gt;For those that are gonna comment here you have no issues with your stash and downvote leave us a list of what you got that you feel is adequate for your game play while still being able to collect items from the game.
---
Well, I'm not going to downvote your idea but I am content with my stash, which holds junk and nothing more. From time to time I've used it to save a nice piece of armor. weaponry, plan, etc. that I'd like to give to a friend, but ultimately anything I'm not using *is* going to be given away. I'm not a collector.
---
There are two main reasons I'm not sure hoarding is something that should be incentivized in 76, compared to single-player Fallout games.
---
1. When other players are involved and PvP is an option, huge stashes could dumb our battles down into tedious wars of attrition.
---
2. Stash limits encourage us to make some tough choices and specialize. This encourages trade and the development of a more efficient player economy, and limits the advantage that can be gained over other players by dumping hours the rest of us don't have into the game.
---
I'm not saying 76 doesn't need other battle, balance, and economy improvements, just that stash size has rippling effects on our gameplay and interactions.
---
There's been abundant conjecture about the effect of stored items on server performance and stability—some believe it's negligible, but only BGS knows and IIRC they've suggested it's a factor. If I were BGS, I'd be doing some item tracking to combat duping, and that could add up. Just a mention-worthy aside.
---
Bulk of springs 50 caps for you , I got my power armor from rcayton :)
---
Metal plans are so dumb rare; I did managed to learn it though from just being lucky.
---
Melee is king for one shoting people. Unarmed builds are best. Find your self a nice assassins armor set, better yet with sentinel. Balance out dmg and mitigation. Dodge, Iron Clad, Serendipity, all that good stuff.
---
There is an INT curve on the scrapping tables, it effects not just the scrapping return, but reportedly the learning chance.  Not all of the data is decoded, and part of it is server side.
---
As for data mining, I'd suggest checking my post history, I'm not a data miner, but a mod author who's been trying to force Feeding Bethesda fixes for this game. 
---
I would very much like this.  Also plans to build sky lights, greenhouse walls and roofs and grow lights.
---
It is
---
In all honesty I find my mind wondering more than actively playing the game , asking myself why do I play .  if you really want something to do try chasing down rare outfits from events . maybe you'll have better luck than me. i've been at it for the last 50-60 levels , I'm 105\106 now 
---
If you find more reason to play please post a reply :p 
---
I have the plan, and I've seen it drop in the wild twice. Also have the prime receiver for it too.
---
‘It’s not a phase!!’
---
Each to there own in this game i suppose, you cannot win everyone, i doubt some who bought the game didnt get to level 10. I seen before the release there was no npc's, the backlash an reaction; i'm not gonna let it effect my judgement on the game 
---
Got red-pilled this week, and what happened to this post?
---
Does anybody know any good screw farming spots
---
Some "raider" types send invites so they can see where you are camping,  travel there,  quit the team and start smashing 
---
Uh yea, exactly... Which has been shown to be an issue.
---
I got some guys who do queens, pvp, and general mayhem if that interests you
---
Proof plus prof of another random glitch lol ghouls that are mole rats and robots at the same time 
---
You think this is bad? You should play Fallout 3. It literally plays once every 3 minut--

#HEY EVERYBODY, DID THE NEWS GET AROUND ABOUT A GUY NAMED BUTCHER PETE?! OL' PETE JUST FLEW INTO TOWN AND HE'S CHOPPIN' UP ALL THE WOMANS MEAT

---
All he needs is a ghoul, a robot and some sweet talking old guy. See you near the van graffs
---
Lol.. Search my posts below...
---
Well said. I built my level 60 around the single shot grenade launcher, relying on devastating sneak damage and mopping up with mines/grenades and melee. I’m doing considerably less damage now thanks to the explosives damage nerf. Sad face. Now, if they could reduce the cost of crafting explosive ammo by 40% I could get on board. That’s be fair. 
---
Perks and charisma can bring it down.
---
It's Old Man Mose for me
---
**BUCK-BUCK-BUCKEEEEEEEET!**
---
Naw, it says something along the lines of "Cant invite player who is in a team already".
---
Can dig it, 
---
Damn there really is no please you fucks huh? Look i know its a shitty game but seriously? The perk tree was made so you HAD to choose certian paths to make a build, if you want to save on crafting then build for that and sacrifice dmg, rad/health regen, etc. Quit bitching about shit and just realized it was a failed attempt. Id like to see you make a fucking game and then listen you all the fucking criticism and THEN you can bitch.. Gamers like myself are horrendous to deal with because we all have an idea of the perfect game but dont understand the complexity of it. Learn before complaining about the other side of the story.
---
So I found hooded rags in a toolbox in watoga. And still have my other ones I mentioned earlier. 
---
Aka “need more ppl for griefing lower lvls, need full group or else we might not beat these solo lvl 30s!”
---
I actually fell for this one, thx for clarifying the BS from cheaters.
---
And that's why it's a bad idea. There's already too many perks that feel mandatory.
---
Over 9000 
---
You should be grateful at all the hard work bethesda is toing to fix this game.
---
I have 200 hours amd am only level 29 and havent seen a single bug.
---
I bet you bought TSE off eBay!
---
/s
---
200?
---
It’s a combination of a couple of glitches.   If you exit a server in excavator armor, when you enter back into play, your weight is +100 until you exit the armor or die.   Then some diseases, roadworks for sure, multiples your mutation effects.   If you had any chems buffing it that would cause a bigger jump than normal to when stacked with the radworms glitch.
---
Is it crazy as a melee player I’m actively looking to get radworms for the increase in twisted muscles damage.
---
Johnny guitar on repeat..... (noooooooo!)
---
Please assume the position 
---
Exactly, they force us to spend a great deal of time with "housecleaning" and the same housecleaning can break the game..
---
My friend got a *** star board 
---
yeah , early on I wanted a pitchfork so badly and I'd zero in on scorched wielding them only to find a pipe pistol,  it was a tad annoying 
---
But isn't that a little silly to have to sit there and count in your head to avoid causing instability?
---
You shouldn't have to, but you might want to.
---
I see. 
---
dont mater what kind of cheat it is, the point remains the same. they get new accounts and do it again. yeah it sucks. never ending battle of bans.
---
Crash to Desktop
---
Lol I hear u, but honestly griefing lvl 30s is boring. Fighting groups of 100+, now that's fun
---
Hell yeah brother!
---
Add clevysauce56 
---
Because your new character doesn't have to grind for it
---
Use mines vs melee. They’ll obviously follow you. Sprint around corners or other cover and drop mines. They’ll run into them then polish them off however you can. 
---

The playerbase is passionate to the point of being whiny dicks. I was firmly in that group when Fallout 3 came out, but have since calmed down.
---
You must be the life of the party.
---
I wonder if pipegirl counts as a member of the untouchables for this weeks event :p
---
Thank you very much. If you are interested I now linked to a photo album  instead. It has the same photos but I have added descriptions about how it was built. Hopefully this helps a few folks out or gives them some ideas that they can use in their own camps.
---
They have crabs and I’m not talking about all you can eat crab legs!!!
---
You’re trolling right? Or you’re being intentionally dense.
---
Exploiting an in-game issue easily falls under the definition of cheating.
---
Doesn’t matter how long the game has been out. Cheating is cheating.
---
Duping affects everyone indirectly. It wrecked the 76 economy. 
---
Using a 3rd party tool to cheat is just a more egregious method of cheating.
---
oof that had to suck
---
*[shrug]* I’ve only been playing the game a few weeks.  I don’t have any real concept about how rare things are, save that I resent wasting time scrounging up screws any time I want to build or repair anything.  If people want to get upset with me for asking a question, that’s their business, not mine.
---
Honestly, I was surprised this wasn't the case when I first started the game.
---
Oof I wish
---
This happened to me literally every time I got a rare chance to play in the afternoon. 
---
This player will probably get banned by Bethesda for having a sense of humor.
---
SBQ is fine on PC. Had a bunch of 5min queens with good players, stretching to 15min with weaker teams. Before the TSE nerf they all died within a few minutes. The biggest challenge was showing up before it dropped dead.
---
The hovering behaviour is caused by people standing in places where the queen can't figure a landing spot, although if you have decent firepower it's not difficult to kill a hovering queen. If the queen lands and then takes off again immediately, no-one's crippling the wings.
---
I don't understand how you can take 50-60 handmade shots to kill a Scorched Conqueror unless you have no perks. My quad handmade requires about five. Instigating lever rifle is a one-shot, even without stealth or a headshot.
---
okay that's worse than mine !
---
Quad hardened pump action shotgun - explosive bullets, quadruple ammo capacity, +50 damage resist while aiming.
---
Let me just make one point...
---
IF THESE PERKS WERE ALREADY PASSIVE NONE OF YOU WOULD BE IN HERE COMPLAINING THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE!
---
Happened to me with my tesla cannon. Had almost 500 rounds I was able to shoot instead of 15
---
That's our prerogative.
---
Who the fuck is anyone else to judge how someone wants to play?
---
Want to fast travel? Make more caps ya fucking mooch 
---
Thanks for the silver!
---
I will be on in 20 minutes
---
Underrated comment
---
If only we could flip this giant enemy crab onto it's back and attack it's weakpoint for massive damage...
---
Hah, I thought this was gonna be a pic of the camp next to the whitespring golf club that's filled with like 50 sirens. I like this better.
---
you lucky dog ! 
---
When I first started PoE I held onto everything. Took me a bit to realize a lot of that wasn't going to be all that useful.
---
Looks like a place where the floor is sticky!
---
Great picture man. I'd be proud to see that pop up on a loading screen
---
Are there different versions of the PA or they all 51B ?
---
Dear Bethesda, please put out an update that doesnt brake more of the game but actually makes it more like the BETA which in my opinion had less bugs on PS4 than the current v1.09 update in which fast travel seems to end in a black screen &amp; loading times are Double the legnth ?????  PLEASE do this before somthing shiney and new is released on the PS4 and everyone leaves the game.....................YOU ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.    No one sticks with games that are frustrating and are just not fun.
---
Then again I guess you have our money so who cares right?
---
Well, if my new mission isnt to make the whore house from Beetlejuice, I don't know what is
---
Ymh is leaking 😮
---
Nuka Cola?
---
For your gf's issue unequip all your armor and re equip it. That usually fixes it for me
---
Problem is explosive damage is easy to negate, padded armor and Fireproof makes mines tickle.
---
Well first you gotta know how to treat the ladies nice, then you might get em😜🤪
---
This is getting so old...
---
R/unexpectedfuturama
---
Well all i can tell you. Go Melee now as long as it lasts. Then VATS Crit build...   
---
Why? These are the next on the chopping block if they continue this nerfing trend.  
---
Melee is currently the most OP thing you can have. Next up is VATS Crit builds.  
---
People didn't get it that the bobblehead stacking and duping was the cause of this mass amounts of TSE weapons killing everything with one shot and everyone had them due to duping.  
---
Now that both of those things are gone, it should be returning to normal again as it was 2 months ago before all this was discovered.  
---
But we can't have that. People hate it when others have fun. People hate it when they don't have something they want. Or if they want THEIR weapon to be the most OP thing and not the one that is currently the "meta".  
---
It is always like this in multiplayer games nowadays. And it always will be like this.   
---
They never realize that there will always be a "meta" for things. And constantly nerfing things that are efficient, is eventually leading to everything being bad.  
---
I didn't even have a TSE myself. Getting one was a thing i wanted to do before the new patch ruined that. Now? I have everyhting done. I explored, i fought the SBQ. I built a nice CAMP. I did a lot of missions and quests.. i am bored. Only thing that kept me going was the "grind" for a TSE.   
---
Not because i wanted to kill everything like most assholes did. But simply because i wanted the feel once how it is to fire that thing. (Always dreamed for a TSE .50 cal)   
---
But yeah.. I only had a normal explosive Assault Rifle. It was okay. But i always were sticking to my unarmed build anyway since i pretty much onepunched through the content.   
---
TL;DR  
---
Go Melee. Use it before it is nerfed too. Then go VATS Crit and use it till it is nerfed as well. Then deinstall the game. (What i did already with this patch and being bored not having a thing to do no more.)
---
I use a normal lever rifle and I kill high level supermutants with 4 or 5 bullets max. Scorchbeats usually around 15 bullets and if they land I shoot them with a normal handmade and they die in seconds. What's the damage on your handmade? 
---
You wanna buy stuff from them still? Lolol
---
Onsie sounds fitting then. 
---
Fake news. SAD
---
For the record, Watoga, Harper's Ferry (and apparently Grahm) all have the Handmade Gun plans all the time.  You don't need to be in a hurry to scrounge up the Caps.
---
Are you trying to initiate "Feed the server" by yourself? 
---
I think desk fans and typewriters have them. Keep your eyes peeled for those because they’re everywhere.
---
Your are not in the minority, it is just hard to really discus something that really does not exist.
---
I could be wrong but I think someone could use this same technique to build a really cool secret bunker under their regular camp. You could possibly place non-stash box containers inside the bunker to store extra loot and get around some of the sash size limitations. 
---
I mean is there a 51A or just a 51 for instance .. I guess the paint does not matter as you can just change it.
---
I believe Betty actually throws the F-bomb in that song.
---
It exists and people I know (and have made it for me) say they got the plan from Line in the Sand. Another redditor suggested that datamines show the plan is referenced twice by Census Violence. The wiki (via datamine I assume?) says it's a random reward for any Cranberry Bog event.
---
Me? Well, I've been doing Bog events for a month. I have no plan. I only have one that someone crafted for me.
---
I dont even want to think about the diseases in there.
---
It did suck a bit but we just got on with it and became quite good at taking them down lol
---
This is so true, I don't lllnow why I see it mentioned so little.
---
Although the .50 cal seems to do decently for faster damage in a short sprint, even if it's less overall.
---
Just changing armor into a percentage reduction would be dandy.
---
U would only see it if there on the same server as u 
---
I’ll take it. Also need a total of 10 pure cobalt just checked. If you have that I’ll also take that 
---
yep welcome to the nerfed world where no ranged weapon is worth anything anymore 
---
Fallout Tactics on 10?
---
No I think its just T-51B 
---
The right message is to not give the company your money again. 
---
Degenerate raiders...
---
Unfortunately OP I’m right there with you, had around 18 people on my friends list that played this. Now down to 3, ps4 servers are getting emptier and emptier. Since the patch I’ve only been in 3 full lobbies. It really sucks to see something you enjoy get torn a part. The worst part of it all for me, is we are getting punished because of the dupers and griefers.
---
Yea after people making up posts about the trade bug to steal items I'm super cynical whenever a new horrific bug happens with this game but there's no evidence to back it up. 
---
Working as designed.   Sorry, that is the truth.   
---
Do not doubt our lord and savior Todd "The Godd" Howard
---
Calibrated shocks + jet pack for the t-51 ?
---
There is much More "junk" that needs to be autoscrapped than items that need to be preserved overall.  
---
The real mistake was adding a value the miscmods could scrap for in the first place.   
---
I get they thought it would a nice mechanic, if you find a mod and you don't want it, scrap it, but really who in their right mind is going to scrap a jet pack or calibrated shocks miscmod?  
---
Once they need it was a problem, it would have taken a couple hours to fix by hand, removing the "scrap" that the miscmods could be scrapped into, and it would be not only the simplest and most elegant solution, it would mean we would not be in the mess we are now. 
---
Dunno, seem to manage just fine, don’t have a melee build and have no issues killing things that need killing.
---
Does the level matter, I might go hunting for one for you ..
---
This is the first time ive seen the neon whats the deal with it.  Is it a old atom store item or can I still find plans for it.
---
sure. ill be on in 10.
---
Tinder?
---
I don't see how robots could be impressed by your charisma, it's better to use charisma to influence party interactions. Why not use intelligence to hack robots?
---
Be thankful you spotted and killed him. 
---
Damn pretty nice
---
More youtube clickbait?
---
It sold. Sorry man. 
---
not really its just to look cool with a nuka cola paint job
---
Did you open a ticket to report it? 
---
Kill lots and lots of super mutants.
---
You can go to Cranberry Bog. Find Wendigos.
---
Lame way: Go to the Abandoned Bog Town in Cranberry Bog. Find the Sheriff's office (white with blue stripe). Turn around. Go up the fire escape to the building you're now facing and fall down the elevator shaft. Pepper mill's, globes, typewriters....
---
Reminds me of Mr Rodger's famous saying
---
yeah had said this but people got mad at me lols
---
Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must go. At the Charleston Whore House we're slashing pussy in half! This is a pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our vast selection of pussy! We got white pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy, yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy, wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy, bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy, smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin' pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, chicken pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have it, you don't want it!
---
Attention pussy shoppers! Take advantage of our penny pussy sale! If you buy one piece of pussy at the regular price, you get another piece of pussy of equal or lesser value for only a penny! Try and beat pussy for a penny! If you can find cheaper pussy anywhere, fuuuuuck it!!
---
Not watching a 40 minute video to figure out what the hell you're talking about.
---
Same here with a TSE lever, and an instigating lever.
---
This is pretty epic 
---
Fun write up... But I'm getting the feeling it's one guy with no oversight.    He's trying but is in over his head.   
---
But seriously.   
---
The real mistake was adding a value the miscmods could scrap for in the first place.   If they had not done that we would have never seen the angry posts about vanishing Jetpacks...  
---
I get they thought it would a nice mechanic, if you find a mod and you don't want it, scrap it, but really who in their right mind is going to scrap a jet pack or calibrated shocks miscmod?  Maybe if it scrapped into several Stable fluxes?  
---
Once they knew it was a problem, it would have taken a couple hours to fix by hand, removing the "scrap" that the miscmods could be scrapped into, and it would be not only the simplest and most elegant solution, it would mean we would not be in the mess we are now. 
---
I played all the fallouts back in the day to completion generally at release.
---
I now have windows 10.
---
I have not tried playing fallout tactics on windows 10.
---
👋🏼
---
Yea I was going to try that on PS4 but found that it would only give me the option to add them if they aren't already friends.  It only gave me the "join" option if it was a friend.
---
Was disappointed when I saw that
---
In my opinions, shotgun is pretty good especially with enforcer. You can get a side arm too just in case. But most things are in range. Except certain flying one. 
---
Yeah, I'm thinking a future DLC might give more information and continue her journey but this quest should have completed and the DLC should be a new quest imo.
---
Seriously, one of the first early mods for Fallout 4... 
---
With the patch, vendors don't change their plans, so server hopping for plans is a thing of the past.
---
I had this same issue on my first launch
---
... haven't launched since
---
Yeah I'm down for pretty much anything I just mosey around now haha
---
R/butthurt 
---
Welcome to the internet!
---
👍
---
Try it out! 
---
SHUT UP ABOUT IT
---
My level during the time of recording was somewhere in the 170 range.  These are two different buildings, so the shapes are not the same.  What I've done is created a large building with the focus of decorating only the exterior.  And then on a separate build I created a building which focused on putting the entire budget to the interior.
---
Dear hearts and gentle people is in the game 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/butthurt
---
.... but shotgun with enforcer is best against flying things. Just shotgun sneeze in their general direction and they land.
---
&gt; he carries four of them to get through a queen fight.
---
Yep.  I do the same, and every single one of them will be broken before she's dead lol. Rate of fire is very high. Maybe fire rate is not the reason, maybe they just made energy weapons fragile. 
---
I hear non- automatic lasers break fast too.
---
I can help with the power armor parts I have lots 
---
Damage drop off with shotguns is not so good. Explosive extends the range. I would recommend a rifle crit build with no perk invested explosive shotgun as a side.
---
Hey dude, just go to Watoga and sever hop. There's three power armor spawn spots. 
---
You know, out of the enemies from 4, I'm surprised they didn't carry over Suicide Mole Rats, Chameleon Deathclaws, Fat-Man Weilders or Nuka-Protectrons (for the Nuka-Cola Plant)
---
I actually hate the song that the women talking about how she has to hold her man to kiss him 
---
Thanks! I thought I'd try here instead of r/fo76photos which is unfortunately mostly dead.
---
?
---
It was always bullshit.  Early on I wanted to level up, so I made/scrapped/made/scrapped throwing knives as fast as I could press buttons.
---
It was and always will be bullshit.
---
In fact, Forget the C.A.M.P.!
---
Here is the background on the HUD issue.  
---
[[Bug Fix] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.
---
(https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/])
---
From a recent post, they are aware of the issue and iirc fixing in next patch.
---
You were getting downvotes for saying Bethesda needed help. And they do
---
Those "serious competency issues and genral chaos" has been going on for years now. That's not just a new occourence with F76. The unreal amounts of bugs has been with Bethesda for years now. What's different with F76 is that there aren't modders to fix the bugs for Bethesda like they did in their single player games. So now we're left with Bethesda having to tackle the bugs themselves as opposed to just dumping the work onto the modding scene to deal with. 
---
And you believe any announcement they make? So does that mean you also believed the great canvas bag shortage of 2018?
---
And i hate to break it to you but Bethesda very much does blatantly lie about things. Just go back to the E3 announcement of F76. They said people wouldn't even notice they're on a server. Or how it's 16 times the detail. Both statements are pretty much untrue and a lie. And lets not forget the canvas bag issue where Bethesda lied in an attempt to safe face only to be revealed that they just cheaped out and hoped nobody would notice their false advertisement. 
---
So yeh i pity you that you actually believe Bethesda without any doubt.
---
I went in and all I saw was a robot named fisto. 
---
I can build them I have a lot of extra sets seeing as i build them for people already and people haven’t picked some up yet 
---
I know. It’s played way too much, and I always cringe when she goes 
---
“Me? HUHUHUHUHUH I HAVE TO HOLD HIM TO KISS HIM”
---
I just wish this song would be added
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbfnh1oVTk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbfnh1oVTk0)
---
there is
---
Lol you’re funny. What’s your gt? I’m in a good base wrecking “ruining other people’s experience” mood
---
I know, last time I was on the game I found myself being clueless as what to do and just ended up building a fort and desperately trying to show people it before giving up because people on the game are also so boring and cucked. Its like they just dont want anything to do with you half the time
---
To clarify, you have the hunter’s hood, not hooded rags right?
---
Wow there partner! You really expect me to watch all that hog wash?
---
no thanks im good
---
Yea i have the plan but I can’t remeber where i got it from. I think I got it after doing a brotherhood event, but who knows how to get it now with all the changes bethesda made.
---
Ha! thanks...   
---
Weird considering my post about Bethesda refusing the help of the MOD author community exploded,'guess it's a little bipolar response?
---
I maxed out my Camp at lvl ~178, now lvl 186 and still cant add additional lighting. Not sure whats going on.
---
Great answer. A+.
---
&gt; The vaults would be ideal for this and I hope bethesda can do something akin to Destiny's Raids, an example where certain characters and builds helped tremendously but it was always possible without them.
---
I thought they'd already announced this is what they where, or maybe I've just read it speculated here.
---
Lol the only they they are gonna do is nerf white springs to make it more like the other areas.
---
Ok well I’ll buy a jetpack anyways 
---
I’m on pc, sadly but thank you!
---
Geez guy, get a room! Lol
---
AAAAAAAAAAAA HELP ME GOD PLEASE GOD HELP ME AAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
You don't get it do you? You say the bugs will be worked out but the fact is that Bethesda not once has actually worked out the bugs in the entirety of their developed games. That's what i am trying to tell you here. You think Bethesda a dev studio that not once actually put effort into fixing their single player game will now "work out the bugs". 
---
I had to actually open the trade menu to loot the item and some of them weren’t obtainable.  Try opening the menu and scrolling down.
---
Worse:  Mirelurks. 
---
for which PA? ill be on in a bit
---
Nice to hear from people like yourself brings my sanity back. If i find more reasons to continue the task of no quests but wait round for some in the hope bethesda bring some; ill let you know
---
This guy SQLs.
---
Is this part of the next DLC?
---
You need to respec your perks, I think. I have a rifle build and ordinary scorched are no big deal
---
Ive read it add +15% per hit and moves over from target to target, idk how many times it stack though.
---
It can be more than one thing at a time you dingus. 
---
I've been fighting these three people on my own for an hour. I've gotten so much caps. Rouphly 1k
---
***Vault style Dungeons ( 3-6 dwellers )*** 
---
With the emergence of dwellers, they have become curious of the surrounding vaults and have managed to crack their way into these terrible test tubes. Found within is a mess of irradiated mutated creatures that were once human, some of these vaults are simply the vault layout whereas some have caved into a layer of tunnels below the vault. Within these altered vaults you can find and hunt down the enemies with your friends, at the end of each vault lies a beast brewed from the toxic remains of the vault 
---
T-60  I can’t buy it yet don’t have materials don’t know what I need either 
---
Thats true 😤 im surpiced its not happened yet. Or in a way it has ofc
---
No, just great game. Don't be a dick and hate.
---
Awesome idea!
---
I got past this by becoming a player vendor. But Bethesda ruined that with the 1500 weight cap. I haven’t played since
---
I'll join I guess. MarcoC0212
---
Ok! Fine, I'll take passionate to the point of whiny dicks, I can bear that.
---
ill let u know in a bit turning on xbox
---
The correct ones will be labeled with a little diamond. You have to find a safe and you get 2 or 3 of the clues from the terminal I believe
---
I had a the same glitch where there was a invisible SB spam attacking us. Couldn't see or target it with VATS even though I was looking right at where it should have been in the sky.
---
Sounds good, psn? Also, do u have a good mic?
---
They'll nerf that once it catches on
---
Radcrabs are the worst!  Uh...a friend told me that.
---
It seems like a glitch. They way I worked around it was running a separate switch box to control it. 
---
One on the roof of the medical center, one that spawns on the building next to the civic center, and one that spawns next to the crashed vertibird
---
Probably because you can only craft it, I don't know if it drops. If someone can correct me if I'm wrong, legendary versions of this weapon don't drop, so therefore you probably only see people with the regular gatling laser.
---
In my last run in lucky hole mine I ended up with 800+ lead thanks to my excavator PA + Super Duper.
---
noooooope, lol really is pretty odd once you have all 3. If you're going to equip just 1, doesn't matter which one it is they all work the same. Maybe Expert and Master give you more bonus to the unlock zone? But even then it's not much difference.
---
Ok I’m almost home so I’ll be there soon Incase I can trade for it 
---
Wish there were community load screens every month or so. Would be nice to see everyone else's funny moments in Appalachia.
---
Thanks a lot for the reply! I would suppose as much from them.. let’s see what their answer is, but I bet it’s going to be the same. Thanks for sharing your answer of your similar situation!
---
Sounds like cheap pussies like you are butthurt over not being able to travel for free.
---
Carry on. 
---
All office builds will have tons of fans and typewriters 
---
I didn’t listen yet. I hope he didn’t have to tell the step-mom story again. 
---
Nice, some people don't know when to admit defeat. I'm happy to take their caps tho 
---
For reals tho fuck that shit
---
Actually a very nice vid that taught me some stuff I didn’t know! Saved. 
---
Frankly, seeing a bunch of those ban posts lately it looks like they're all from like three people that are just posting over and over again each time their post gets deleted anyway.
---
I've. Just been doing PvP.
---
I just made 1k caps by fighting 3 lvl 100s on my own
---
This is spot on my feeling on this subject as well. I pushed through the bugs but what made me stop was having nothing meaningful to do. I could easily spend more time playing this game if I had anything to do. 
---
Same as my username, come get rekt nub 
---
Omg thank you. I haven't genuinely laughed in this sub for weeks. Much needed.
---
We'll played :) 
---
cheers man!
---
I wish you the best of luck in finding the answer you seek and staying patient. I'm barely holding on myself, even considered uninstalling the game last night but still here lol. 
---
Sorry I don't do trades only caps
---
They've worked out plenty of bugs in this game. You just don't get that I don't agree with you and I don't have to agree with you. I'm aware of their track record. That doesn't make the game less enjoyable right now, or their previous games. "Not once actually" is completely dishonest and overly dramatic. Sure some existing bugs prevailed, but to pretend they never fixed any of the bugs is being very dishonest. 
---
You're an effing nerd.... and i love it.
---
Actually enjoyed that.  Not a whole ranting hate-train for clicks &amp; activating a pitchfork wielding mob, but a well reasoned, fairly logical video.
---
Lol. They had TSE shotguns and Fat Man's but I was faster in VATS and I was stealthy
---
You know what grinds my gears? Workbenches. 
---
Oh yeah can I join you group?
---
Ok 
---
Oh yeh..... Im actually busy for the next Like 1.5-2 hours, but if you’re on then, I will find you and destroy 
---
I hear there is a good place in Charleston..
---
You mean this one? https://gear.bethesda.net/products/vault-76-onesie
---
Yes yes, everyone that disagrees is a fanboy. Demonizing people that disagree with you is a common tactic of those with fragile egos. I don't care how many people are playing. I'll play the game as long as it's fun. As soon as it's not fun, I'm out. I don't need some kind of neurotic loyalty or hatred of Bethesda to form an opinion on something. 
---
Ah so you're the reason I can never find any straight jackets anymore lmaooo jk jk that's my ploy too lmao
---
I don't disconnect, but there's a 50/50 chance I'll spawn in that area with the "black screen power armor HUD". Only happens there.
---
I'm level 73 and I enjoy fighting bounties and having one.
---
There is no real story aside from the overseer and that's not an end game experience.   Bethesda just didn't put much effort into storylines.   Killing the massive bullet sponge queen isn't that satisfying and leaves one wanting something more meaningful. 
---
Nobody knows. I have a furious lever and I think it’s actually bugged. Sometimes it works. Sometimes is doesn’t.
---
They said they had plans for the vaults but I don't think anything has been confirmed
---
You will get a Max of 45% damage. I think it's more like 5% per hit through testing I've done. Seemed glitched but it was between 7-9 hits for Max damage.
---
Even with bobble head stacking to 24,000 damage per shot it does 5 hp if you’re not flagged for PvP. There’s video proof from multiple sources.
---
The truth is that many players are ignorant of the PvP mechanics that get them flagged (workshops, teams, reactive mutations and power armor mods, etc) and then they cry “dupers, exploiters, bobble head stackers are everywhere!!11”
---
It’s sad.
---
Sent a friend request, Il invite u whenever I'm on
---
Also why does my laser rifle only work in first person view ????  
---
Lmfao yes!
---
I am under the impression many of the armor plans are just missing from the game having never found them in hundreds of hours or at any of the vendors.
---
Exactly
---
Lol I really need to buy this game.  I keep putting it off but the more I see people’s personal touch (I’m looking at you “take a supply, leave a supply people-oven) being left on their camps and shaping the overall game experience, the more I want to be a part of it.
---
Once you hit 50, you should be able to fully respec and choose a card each level after.
---
Let them fix the bugs FIRST.  Additions LATER!
---
This I would like to know too. I haven't seen them at ALL.
---
Having the same issue here only with trying to use two different handmades, every time I log in one of them is dropped off of my favorites and I have to reset it. Didn't start happening until the last patch.
---
The weapon of love!
---
I save those up for a hoard of enemies....how the hell do they have the blast radius of a dime....a super mutant standing atop one wasnt even hurt by it due to how small the blast area is.
---
If you look at the mothman closely, it's a reskinned mirelurk.
---
I didnt create an explosives build to pvp. I’m just as likely to kill myself.
---
What's the base damage on a normal Lever Rifle?
---
My two shot handmade takes more than 5 shots to kill a level 68 Super Mutant and it does roughly 100 damage with 5 rifleman perks and 3 anti tank.
---
I thought a normal Lever does somewhere around 50 damage????..... I don't know what the HP is on a 68 Super Mutant but it's  gotta be well above 250. My instigating Super Sledge does 520 on the first swing and only drains half of their life bar.
---
You're playing fallout 76, you already got screwed 
---
*baduhm tiss*
---
What's your psn
---
Were you joining through a friend or just hoping to hop on the same world? 
---
In the new patch SB are affected by the pacify perk, therefore the SBQ would have been affected, even though it probably shouldn’t, so it’s currently a “feature”.
---
Legendary story. More of this is needed. +karma
---
Bthirst68
---
Haha gl. Btw I’m lvl 230 with full Assassin sentinel gear and about 10 bloodied weapons that all out out more dmg than your highest dmg weapon. Bring it
---
You're not wrong :D
---
Yeah he is a great builder. Check out some of his fo4 builds if you want some other great build ideas
---
Lucky mine and Hornswright #3 while wearing excavator. Craft with super duper and ammosmith.
---
this post made me buy the game. Gonna make a spotify playlist that consists of 200 entries of john denver for when this baby finishes installing
---
I think it was another player cause I was taking crap tons of radiation damage unless it was a invisible scorched with a bugged up gamma gun but more likely another hacker player I even had pacifist enabled but was still dying to what ever it was
---
Yes, raider scum...
---
I think the game would be better with NPCs but, if it were up to me and that wasn't an option, than yes. I feel like it would better to have someone you can talk to over comms or something.
---
Dialogue and dialogue choices are a staple of Fallout, not having those was a horrible choice in my opinion. Being able to talk to NPCs, even if you never saw them face to face, would still be considerably better than what we got.
---
To your last point, while it does make sense their are no people it hurts the story. For me there's less motivation to do anything because it all means nothing.
---
PUSSEH PUSSEH BOI
---
You can technically tame some creatures to stay at your camp through a combination of wasteland whisperer, and animal friend perks.
---
I would love that. They need to add a community hub... we are fellow vault dwellers.
---
Imagine an actual instance where people who grew up together and such were set free in this world and seriously never get together? 
---
Sounds more like high school and high school reunions actually... 
---
Nevermind, nothing i said made sense.
---
Aside from that, ghouls heal your rad damage when you have rad worms now. At least those in monster mash do 100% replication rate. 
---
Yeah I saw that but it shouldn’t restore her health like that
---
This is just when I need to make caps fast - light getting the recently posted plans for calibrated shocks and jet packs at the BOS vendor. After that I found excavator plans at Camden park vendor - spent about  25k all told.
---
Usually I just bulk up all the junk I found through quests and scrapping and sell it to vendors. A view hours work nets me enough bulk to make 14k a day.
---
Also forgot to mention that hard bargain level 3 is a must as is travel agent.
---
Lmao its got some traffic tho, pros and cons to every location
---
Its been an issue since Fallout 3 tbh higher level content becomes a pain due to how spongy all enemies become.
---
Running heavy isn't bad because you can main almost any gun as a secondary since it's in strength and rifles and shotguns are in perception, you can also eventually unlock all the melee perks. Most classes are versatile except melee taking up cards in almost all special stats for a decent build. 
---
I wish. Been searching nonstop since the patch. 
---
Upvote allll day, good sir or ma'am!
---
Crafting ammo in huge amounts since the beginning - yeat to get banned. 
---
That might be more a thing with Xbox Live then
---
Dont buy the plans, do the powering up plants event until u get it. Along side the plans you also profit
---
Tons of mutated fern on prime. With perk cards I can get 100+ raw violet each time
---
DO NOT USE SCRAP ALL JUNK WITH BULK IN YOUR INVENTORY. Because you will cry... a lot. Son of a bitch, Bethy.
---
Don't recall well enough from Fallout 4, but I've run into more rats that have mines strapped to them that charge and boom. Mole miners usually control them. 
---
yeah I tried to get people to interact with my trade shop, but no one did and if they were there it was usually to tear it down with their explosive mini gun.
---
Great it’s on. Why sentinel over unyielding tho? 
---
You think 250caps is too much???
---
Try buying neon letters..
---
Is there a sign inside that says Gloryhole?? 
---
That's right, I got some fine legendaries to sell:
---
AA boxing glove lvl 5 1*

AA buzz blade lvl lvl 35 1*
---
Instigating cane lvl 40 1*
---
Mutants cane lvl 40 1*
---

---
Unyielding studded leather right arm lvl 50 2*
---
Nocturnal metal left leg lvl 10 1*
---
Chameleon wood right arm lvl 35 1*
---
Loon into prostitution...
---
Butcher Pete isn’t as bad as that in my opinion 
---
I haven't seen them but I have learnt them I can mod for you if you want xbox
---
75% dmg resistance is why
---
Would be even worse to trust some random redditors with zero credibility right when a lot of stuff is being done against dupers who sold their stock for real life money. 
---
It’s weird I rarely get country roads on the radio even though the game has it in the trailer 
---
Never though I'd see eye to eye with a raider
---
Isn’t the only difference moving vs standing? 
---
or being sexist? 
---
I hope they know about the lighthouse event too.  
---
The suicide mole rats appear during an event in Ash Heap - called something like "Having a Blast"
---
I have 6 - drop me your psn
---
100 per work for you? 
---
Ouch?
---
I starting reading and thought to myself "wtf is he talking about" anyone else feels the same?
---
I may have one or two on Xbox. They’re pre-patch
---
Saw it exactly once, green laser look dope and am actively hunting the recipe right now, with little luck sadly. After i get it I will move out of cranberry bog permenantly. 
---
Humans that aren't made of paper. Looking at you scorched. 
---
Well, it's definitely a caps business, easier to hide your wealth from the government.
---
You have to eat around the bugs
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I gotta fuckin get in there. 
---
250 caps or hours of crap doing the power up 
---
It's not a glitch to use a perk in the game.
---
On the bright side, chances are future games will be a joke anyway, so he won't be missing out. Less money given to Bethesda. No drawbacks.
---
Don't get use to it.
---
My psn is : skyxlimit13 I'll be on in the next hour, I want/need adrenal, electrically charged,  marsupial, speed demon.  1200 caps...easy day,  fuck ill give you 2k if you are on tonight
---
Eventually you'll have all perks maxed anyway, don't sweat it too much right now. 
---
From what I understand his perks were working fine before the nerf.
---
Some people have a life outside of Fallout and respecing perks isn't as easy as you make it sound.
---
There was a video on here a few days ago about how to use it without eating your ammo. 
---
They equipped the gun, put their ammo in a paper bag, put the gun in the bag, took the gun out, then the ammo. The gun then worked properly. 
---
Experiencing similar beyond the entering the game while in excavator armor giving extra carry weight. I'm also wondering if when I remove and re-apply perk cards that give weight reduction in order to do crafting etc if they are actually doing what they are supposed to. Thinking that when you log in perk cards are applied, then your armor if it has additional weight reduction perks and how the order that things are applied isn't boogering things up or changing the values, though I've not played around with equipping and un-equipping  perks and armor in different orders to see what happens.
---
Go melee, go whitespring, kill ghouls, pick up wonderglue and duck tape.
---
You realize the items will probably get lost right? Like, deleted off the server kind of lost, not losing your baggage and go find it kind of way 
---
Sepll.  Irony.  
---
Play something else and come back when they release a DLC? It’s okay. We are allowed to enjoy other things in life. Go outside; the graphics are awesome!
---
I've noticed this since the nerf patch. Here's what fixes it for me. Get out of the power armor and wait until it is recalled to your inventory. Take it back out, hop in and it should be reset.   You may also want to look into power user and batteries included if you are in power armor all the time. One reduces fusion core weight and the other greatly reduces the rate at which you burn through them.
---
Cavalier is the affix that provides damage resistance while sprinting.
---
Plus sentinel and unyielding are not mutually exclusive so you can also have an armor with unyielding and sentinel, I just wanted to have the protection from players so I can decimate griefers like yourself.
---
Lol, this sub don’t want to face the music.
---
Get a lease and a key!
---
Never heard about them being better in greater numbers. Got BoS stuff by doing it one at a time. 
---
I have been dreaming of like a courier service that would act like a mail system between players. Sending notes/loot/supplies to friends who are offline, but can check their mail to see if they received anything...
---
^lesigh a raider can dream....
---
You really need to respec there's something seriously wrong with your build. My 1* furious handmade hits harder than that and I'm commando o.o are you not using rifleman and tank killer? Bloody mess? I don't play meta just have fun no vats but you must be missing a lot of damage perks
---
Walked away with bone worms AND sludge lung 
---
Are you still selling mutations?
---
I loved their system.
---
Not really dishonest when it's a fact that most of the bugs were actually fixed by the modders rather then Bethesda themselves. Just because you ignore the bugs doesn't mean others have to accept the state of the game and just shut up about it. What you don't realize however is that very nature of "ignoring the problem" is what led to Bethesda becoming the way they are in the first place. Due to nobody actually complaining about the excessive amounts of bugs in their games they thought it would be alright to ship it like that to the point that they themselves even joked about it at their E3 presentation. But thankfully the gamer seem to actually slowly wake up and contest the bullshit publishers are trying to pull. So maybe one day the publishers actually start caring about their customers again as opposed to following the unrealistic growth expectations of the shareholders like they do now. It's either gonna be another video game crash like back in the day or devs finally waking up and realize that the way they're heading isn't sustainable. 
---
You on the other hand simply don't seem to care how you're treated. 
---
Tag those pussies!
---
This needs to get top post.
---
What platform? Cause this seems abnormal. 
---
ditto
---
Yeah that works

Someone told me that you get more rewards so I’ve been picking up a lot and turning them in and getting the same stuff :/ did you get the t-60 paint?
---
Shotguns are also in strength.. 
---
This happened to me a few times from a glitch. Some of my items like the water purifier and generators were duplicated and put in storage in my c.a.m.p. I just scrapped them and got the space back. 
---
yes
---
*thumbs up* we need more communication like this. Let's hope you keep it up!
---
Maybe first times are long, but poseidon for example can be done in 10min by a single person. 
---
Check stored tab for random garbage that got duplicated when you logged on or off, 
---
If you've ever scrapped something with wires attached the wires don't go away, same for other objects that can disappear when deleting attached pieces.
---
already have batteries included, and getting 3 levels and putting my precious points into power user, which does not fit into my current build wont be happening. Will try the recall thing if it helps
---
pc
---
There's an acid resource in the middle of that pond btw
---
Give me 30 mins i will check it all. 
---
Its both.
---
No, when we blow up the institute in one of the possible futures it sends the institute to Appalachia. They're working on funding to rebuild synth construction and selling us teleportation to do it. Next update: synths run amok in Appalachia and we lose fast travel
---
Of course it is 
---
Thanks friend 
---
From youtube I’ve also heard to turn in more than one but my inventory only shows one no matter how many I pick up 
---
&gt; Ski "Wooden Ski" [MISC:0012B926]
---
Are wooden skis even used for crafting anything? Ski swords use composite skis, which get autoscrapped.
---
Just had someone craft me one ❤️ I'm still going to look for the plans tho - can't wait to try it out!! 
---
It's a bug...another one.  Had they tested it for 2 minutes they would have known themselves.   
---
Ladydevann I think 
---
My entire build was heavy TSE. Completely ruined now because of "fixes". Never did PvP.
---
Im on Battlefield now waiting for Anthem...
---
Dude hop off your high horse. It’s not that your a “proper queen killer”, it’s that going through the process to kill the king simply isn’t worth it anymore.  I have run the nuke launch a hundred times with my buddies and never once used that cheat glitch. After the last patch it’s not worth the ridiculous amount of ammo and supplies for sub standard rewards from the queen. And if by your definition “proper queen killers” don’t use TSE, then I’m guessing your a melee build, and I can say just how much everyone loves it when y’all are hiding in a shed while we shoot the queen because “I’m waiting for it to land!!!!”
---
The phantom wire budget can be regained by placing your camp again 
---
I can also kill a scorched beast with 400 dmg. But it takes way too many shots to be worth killing. 
---
I was watching my husband play earlier, and he recently discovered the ammosmith perk. He fully ranked up his ammosmith perk, and then had another level up. He chose ammosmith, thinking it ranks it up more, and tried placing it in his S.PE.C.I.A.L slot only to find it pushed out his fully ranked perk card. Lol
---
I wasn't watching him do this part so i couldn't warn him. But i too did this in the beginning... and destroying those 1 perk cards would be handy after you've fully ranked one of them up. 
---
That's it
---
I love that I can stash 4 high level items in the secret stash and that my low level new character can sell them and not be flat broke 
---
It might. Either this or a triple gilded "I'm leaving!", pretty much a 50/50 shot
---
Nerf, nerf, nerf
---
Yes, this is actually a common occurrence with this game.  Just uninstall and walk away. This fixes all known and future issues with this game.
---
Ive been a 76 guy since launch, but I totally agred
---
The longer Bethesda keeps chasing its tail trying to fix bugs and find a balance, the longer it will take to put in more content. I was okay with them needing to sort things out, but its taking too long and the game will become irrelevevant by the time they can load the game with stuff to do.
---
If a level 68 scorched take 50 bullits, he is doing something «wrong». He has a powerful weapon. My non legendary rifles will kill that enemy in 1 to 6 shots, depending on sneak or criticals. People should play the game in what ever way they are having fun, sure. But dont blame the devs if you completely ignore putting perks into your weapon of choice..
---
Haha!!
---
I did that with red dead and it didn’t fix anything :/
---
Seems bugged then, am on pc and the rate is something around 45 min of usage for a core. Without power user. 
---
As an update, All-Rise no longer prevents death from radiation, I'd guess they patched this and other +health items.
---
Clever coding humor. Love it
---
His weapon got nerfed dude.
---
His perks were fine. How the fuck would he have known pre nerf that the perks he was picking would be made obsolete?
---
Mods?
---
Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer are explicitly not supposed to work on Scorched or Scorch Beasts. It's a glitch.
---
I think you are not being honest, and the worst part is that Bethesda has lied so many times about things that you no longer have the benefit of the doubt that I would give to a developer I trusted. 
---
I loved the Fallout universe and the games that come from it. I was blessed enough to be able to work on the first two Fallout games and pre-ordered Fallout 76 in order to check the game out for the "Beta". 
---
I knew right off the bat that there were serious fundamental flaws in game design, and far FAR too many game breaking bugs for a game that was just a couple weeks from shipping. 
---
Anyone with sense would have pushed the game off for a few months to polish everything up...it is a normal thing that happens in this industry, but nope you guys pushed the game out in an Alpha state as if it were a polished AAA game. 
---
Then I was told that refunds weren't an option if I downloaded the game( that is scam artist area right there). Your "updates" were anything but, and just nerfed the hell out of the game to push people to want to spend more when the shop is updated with the "pay to win" crap.
---
Not even going to go into the "Rare" canvas bag debacle...or the rum bottle silliness and lies around that.
---
Then the update that rolled everything back and brought tons of bugs back...that is just rookie mistake stuff. Pathetic really. 
---
So excuse me for not believing you at your word. Your company has screwed so many people again and again that you no longer have the good will you once had, and it seems to only be getting worse. 
---
sorry if my question was rather direct, I didn't mean to sound rude! I'm always curious to know more about these hidden effects in the game. Thank you for the info, much appreciated. 
---
Peace out buddy, we’ll all be here having fun without you 
---
When I first started running this one I would always get more than two things, but lately it's been some type of aid/chem and some sort of ammo. I've run it a bunch and it doesn't seem to matter if you have one  or ten in your inventory.
---
Where the hell was this when I played this game. Would have made my sessions a lot more fun. 
---
Yep I've looted both a pretty decent Flamer and LMG recently, but the ammo crafting makes them unusable.  
---
Then that is on the people that lack it. Do not baby the stupid for if you do they never learn. 
---
Lol is that a decontamination chamber in there?!
---
Hotplates too I think.
---
Alright I'll keep you up to date. 
---
Yea just stimpack and ammo is all I get I used to get bos armor plans but not anymore lol I just want the paint
---
Thanks Todd.  
---
Thanks for the update.
---
2 things.
---
1, they have a log of your character, and probably see it doing the event a fuck ton, so nothing weird other than you have a lot more time than others.
---
2, if its that easy to get then the number internally for this item is like 10 million, not 500k. also companies throw out random numbers that are close enough for the public but not for the hackers to avoid. if they told you all the rules and flags, they told the hackers, and then the hackers know EXACTLY what to avoid.
---
Did a nuke zone yesterday up by the water park. Not a ton of flora in general, but enough to make about 6 stable cobalt
---
Blocker gives you 45% less melee damage once it's maxed out (3 points)
---
Great for pvp and glowing gouls
---
You get a very small xp boost if you've picked up two.  I do them 1 at a time and have gotten all the rewards from it, even the paint jobs. 
---
Of course it does...people paid full price for a AAA game and got a broken alpha version with recycled dragons from a different game universe. Bethesda pissed a lot of fans off and they are not afraid to say so.
---
Protip: learn from this mistake and avoid the apathetic  developers of Bethesda:((
---
I had commented on another post and suggested they do something with the special “moving” cards you get with the card packs. If they could make it so at least for every one you get for lockpicking/hacking you make it so you automatically unlock level 0, then 1, etc. for each. I just don’t know why have special cards with nothing but an aesthetic difference. 
---
Wow ok then good to know lol 
---
Most are nice. I’m always nice. Today 3 people over level 200 destroyed my entire camp that I leave open to the people with 20 water purifiers always full. But it happens. 
---
Interesting...
---
I personally don't get that issue after the last patch. 
---
Try scanning your game files via the launcher. You might have an issue with a corrupted file. 
---
You'd be surprised how often that fixes these issues. 
---
That's what I always see them going for at Vendorbot Pheonix.
---
I for one thank you.  I'm on the verge.
---
Back in Dec. or Nov. I had a similar bug with a pipe bolt action, but it didn't require any legendary weapons for it to trip. At one point it ended up having over 1000 rounds loaded.
---
Yeah, they really need to listen to the expert armchair developers on reddit
---
I would want a pack Brahmin named [B]essie
---
theres still DR cards in general though. its not like ranged builds have 1000 perk points to choose from. 
---
It can even be used as a slight bank/stash increase.
---
He could not know. Im just saying rifles don’t have to suck as much as OPs does. 
---
Melee. 
---
Yes, all the cards you get by mistake + all the duplicates you get every 5 levels. 
---

Weight is a good place to start, but is heavily influenced by what mods it has so it varies a lot.
---
I'll be outside selling bulk rubber.
---
This is the worst possible approach they could take. In fact, whitesprings should remain just as they are, but still be a medicore spawn. We need a dramatic boost in quality and quantity of the mobs like everywhere, and also, each nuke should automatically generate 20 new respawn points. I myself refuse to do whitesprings anymore and I do not consider that place cool enough. I want zones full of deadly super mutants and beasts that are truly legendary. Its not like whitesprings is too good, the rest of map ain't good enough, spawnwise.
---
How long will you be on for? I can get on within the hour to buy the mutations
---
Making it so you use charisma to woo the life-savings caps out of merchants? You might be a low-key con-man.
---
But his didn't suck until Bethesda moved the goal posts.
---
The point you ask? I suspect it’s done to give folks a laugh when you finally spawn in only to find your nearly dead surrounded by hostiles.  Honestly the game is becoming so depressing I laugh when it happens to me.  If I didn’t laugh I’d be one of the folks posting about how they’re quitting.
---
Just did a fresh install too.
---
Still nothing. :(
---
All the time 
---
Joke's on you, OP, I can’t eat cheetos because I’m lactose intolerant. Who’s the idiot now.
---
Yes, they delayed new content until the bugs are addressed. But honestly, how long is that going to take? It's been 3 months and there are still bugs in the game from the beta. They must have a really small team if they're unable to work on bug fixes AND new content at the same time.
---
No, but there were 2 stash boxes- a suitcase labeled 'Bondage' and a footlocker labeled 'Sex Toys'  
---
I wasn't able to get a picture of those; I was server hopping to try spawning the Charleston Vendor Bot, and had already left the world when I posted the picture.
---
Billings Homestead?
---
Lol yes it was
---
I’ve had it CTD twice in 316 hours of playing. 
---
Take the hint 
---
I miss dialogue options very much and I agree with you. They could of at least let us talk to the robots. 
---
Yeah it's a stupid change really. Removes the incentive to call them down. I have like 30 requisition tapes
---
Seriously! To me (on PS4) it’s worse than it was before they “fixed” it. I’d gladly go back to the way it used to load in. 
---
I wasnt a big eso fan, but I hated seeing every player with the same pet in tow. Maybe im in the minority, but I'm not for it.
---
I'll have some of what this guy's smoking. It'll pair well with the Doritos.

If you're in no rush I'll keep an eye out and grab one if I see it for you. It took me a few days to get the pieces I needed. But im in watoga pretty much daily.

Actually no, mine is right next to Camp McClintock. But you believe whatever you want.
---
Log in and out
---
No I totally see what you are saying. Like we just spent 23 years in a vault together. Doesn't matter if you're a raider and I'm a liberator we would still get together. 
---
Disagree, while TSE were overpowered, they are not as overpowered as Melee.  Bugs and stability issues still need more attention before balance issues.
---
Ink Spots!! Gosh 
---
That is another really good strategy. Basically if your stuff gets destroyed it would not take much to repair it. I have seen several videos where people use existing in-game structures to camp in. Like the one you mentioned lots of them have one or more crafting stations already there. Some of them even have water and different stuff to collect that re-spawns fairly often.  
---
Another strategy I have seen people use is just to build very far off the beaten path. They often build small camps that are fairly well hidden.  
---
Yes that was the real Todd Howard
---
Perk card works well at discounting travel costs!
---
Also true. Then he must adapt or play something else. Or just keep sucking in F76 and whine on reddit. Tough choices.
---
Lol. 
---
Worse: Scorched Mirelurks.
---
If you invest ypur perks right you can have rifle/shotgun (or melee) and vats critical. Thats what I run.
---
Skip pistols and energy weapons.
---
That's a whole bunch of evidence. It's like OJ he said he didn't do it so he must be telling the truth.

Good eye. I had accidentally made it one word and autocorrect must’ve changed it

waiting for recall and hopping back in didnt fix it...

Hello - want to make a note that the Weapon Artisan perk does not repair the laser rifle to 200%. Additionally, the laser rifle seems to break at a significantly increased rate compared to ballistic rifles. Thank you for looking into this. 
---
lol, I really like this.
---
Nice your door is exactly like mine!
---
Only difference is I put the rad shower right inside the door between it and the switch plate and wired it to the door's connector so it turns on anytime the door is open.
---
I like to think of it like those big heaters stores have in the winter to keep the cold air out.

Check the fallout bazaar someone on Xbox was offering to make full set for people.

That's an ignorant position to take.

I could understand you not giving a shit because you weren't effected.....but it takes a real ass to chime in to tell him to just deal with it.

Especially when you can only spawn one at a time, with a cooldown

I think they could take a page from RuneScape's book with the whole Grand Exchange.

These 3 things. There's a building that's part of a workshop down the southeast ridge of the map. There's a hole in the roof that leads to a room full of fans and typewriters.

I don't think a lvl 80 would go for a crate. They almost never have anything I'd want.

Country roads is played almost never, which is weird.
---
I’ve found 4 different explosive weapons legit. Built my character around them, so I was hit hard. I was actually trying to be helpful in telling him he could use rifles in a better way. 
---
Nope not overkill. Saves camp budget. Looks better. No noise. 
---
Sounds good but i woulxnt want to sacrifice my CAMP to build in a TOWN
---
No, you should be banned for being a tedious git.
---
Damn. I accidentally removed my response. But it still stands. At E3 we were lied to about so many things. That should go without saying as Todd and the developers have lied before on multiple occasions. This game is so broken and was released way too early. All over greed and pride. At this point it doesn't matter I am uninstalling my game as we speak. I absolutely despise a liar and a thief. Bethesda has become the EA Sports of games.
---
I've seen grahm but I haven't found him is there like a specific area I can find him in consistently?
---
Might be another one of those oven traps...
---
Thank you for your brave post.
---
Same.  I get the impression it happens whenever a new area loads into my game client, most typically with larger towns, Charleston, Grafton, etc.
---
Rofl, probably some 9yr old
---
Which sucks because it's still in the camp budget. I'd just store the wall and it should give the letters back too. 
---
Gotta get rid of dem STDs

Base vending machines would be ideal. Don't want it ending up like d3 where criminals start washing irl money lol

Go to  **Dabney Homstead** I take it all the time and there are usually 3 to kill to take the place and one extra behind the house.

I tend to send invites to people highish level when i find Grahm so they might have the chance of trading with him
---
I have the reverse issue with the Plasma Minigun.  If I swap to it from something else it always has the same amount of ammo as my total number of plasma cores, instead of it's normal ammo account, so I have to reload it every time I pull it out.
---
Burn down the server farm, shut down the game, salvage all the assets and re-release the game as a dlc for fallout 4 with NPCs, stories, and privately hosted sessions of 4 players on their own systems.  Give up on the game as a service model.  Not many changes needed even for the story or timeline.  Incase you haven’t noticed your pip-boy date always reverts to October 23.  Time only passes while on a server, but reverts after a server jump or religious/logout.  According to fallout 3 residents of vault 76 were released from the vault after 20 years NOT 25 years.  This entire game could simply be a session in the memory den in goodneighbor.  That would neatly close up All the lore errors and issues. ;)
---
I got them just now. 
---
The bees are the stingiest?
---
I think is around 160. I use adrenal reaction so I can get it to around 200.
---
I play on PS4 I'm Power Armor only, too. But have never had an issue like that 🤔
---
LOL, my TSE Assault Rifle, which i got from a trade, is only doing 120 damage with full perks. Stop your disinfo
---
And I don't mean to specifically pick on any single person.  Todd, Pete all of them are to blame.
---
I love it! Keep up the good work
---
That was my first thought. Hope so :D
---
You just need some wasteland slaves to row that thing.

Both this comment and the actual post is hilarious.

Xbox combat armors plans mods at watoga toga toga.

All of these items stack. They have never been used in duping.

Someone posted a 20 minute video going around to vendors and looking at their plans. I would prefer a spreadsheet, but this is the best I could find for now. Maybe someone with some spare time can watch the video and fill in the spreadsheet.
---

---
Nuff said.
---
That's the main reason why I don't care about most of the outrage. People were doing the exact same thing with New Vegas and a year or two later it's on this pedestal of awesome (despite it still having MANY bugs that'll crash the game so you gotta mash F4 quite often) - I think once all the anger about bags and bobbypins weighing slightly too much die down this games good points will still be there. It's a bang up fun exploration game if you take your time with it (and amazing to play with a friend).
---
Not there but i can imagine at level 400 it would not go fast to switch 10 points or cards around wich would mean u need to farm 10 levels at who knows how much xp per level by then
---
I wonder if you can tame a scorchbeast for your camp before the next patch...
---
Any chance you're doing a lot of vats crits?  Using vats and crits are draining me really fast now.  It's not as drastic as you described if you're just moving around and it's dropping quickly
---
There is a spreadsheet posted in the top comment

Found heavy combat armor chest plan at Watoga Station vendor. Cost just over 1k caps.
---
Good thing this was patched months ago?
---
Weird. My map shows that part of the route.
---
No worries and not offended, the Internet does not encourage subtlety.   
---
That's about the extent, until everything is decoded some of it will be a mystery, but in tests some of us have seen those with a high INT (and or Luck) get better results trying to learn mods from scrapping 
---
I've taken at least a couple dozen workshops since Christmas and haven't been hit by PvP at all yet. So I think either I've been lucky or not many people are utilizing it. If it does finally catch up to me, one death in over a month is not a big deal.
---
I do let my workshops fall to the 2nd defense event though, so I only have them for about an hour or less. I just take them once, defend once, and never return.
---
Fallout 76 is 200 years before 4 lol

It's worth trying out with the Prime receiver if you have that. For some reason the prime receiver plans are really easy to find for it.
---
One fusion core plus one flux and one Ultracite scrap gets you an overcharged cell. It gets a decent damage bump and if you have a lot of half charged fusion cores you can craft them into 100+ condition Ultracite cores for cheap.
---
I got one 2 days as an event reward. If I remember correctly it was a cranberry bog event but I’m not positive which, may have been distant thunder or the one that involves protecting an ASAM site (can’t remember the name of that one) XB1

Jokes on you u/nachingcl, he said Doritos, not Cheetos.
---
Pacifist doesnt make you immune to other players FYI
---
yes vats critting is exactly the thing im doing, fighting definitely speeds up the drain but even without fighting my cores drain in about 5mins, defending my power plant and doing 3 waves of mutants drained me 3 cores
---
So we've been sold a bill of goods, and we should just go away and not try to make it clear that we want what we paid for, or a refund?
---
Do you really want to make it easy for the people that screwed you over? 
---
They should just check out the horizon mod...customizable armor, craft/dissemble ammo, legendary system totally reworked and toned down, ammo effects....everything fo76 should have.
---
Fuck.

Was going to mention this had it not been posted. 
---
I think the song I hear the most is the one about the lady that shoots people and then gets shot in the end. Would like to hear more butcher pete(its been a while since fallout 3 for me) and the song about some dude trying to catch the devil or whatever.
---
I am running on stock clocks. My got is a nvidia 970gtx,16gb of ram at 2400, a ssd that windows 10 is on, and a mechanical drive the game is on. I even have extra case fans to prevent overheating. I have played fallout 4, farcry 5, dying light, and other games with no problems. 
---
The time travel is implied when you read "in one of the possible futures"
---
There's nothing againts rules with any of what you desribed.
---
How about the ability to scrap undesired ammo.
---
Not click bait, follow up post to One the community responded well to, I'm sorry if the title is too vague, just didn't know how to pack in more without sounding bitter..
---
Is there really a need for fast travel to cost any caps? 
---
Shotgun is useful, but be prepared to spend 80% of your play time looking for plastic.
---
????
---
You can still adapt your build. After 50 you can move you're skill points around and fix anything you've messed up.
---
I would just keep going, you are still early in the leveling game. I didn’t create my build until about level 35. 
---
There goes your bag!
---
Even with that.... unless you're counting sneaks and critical hits I'm pretty sure a level 68 overlord is taking more than 1k damage. I don't see you dropping them 6 super mutants rushing at you with 30 shots.
---
In a perfect world critical multipliers can probably do that but realistically sneaks and crits are pretty much  toast after 2 shots.
---
No doubt rifles are weak and enemies are bullet sponges in this game. The only remaining question is if Bethesda is just really bad at balancing weapons or are they doing it intentionally to make the game more of a grind.
---
awhile.
---
Or convert it into something useful. Hell make it so it costs 100 .38 rounds to make anything else. Even with that conversion ratio I'd literally never ever get close to running out of ammo.
---
Is it illegal to provide ASMR for caps?
---
Ahh i thought once you hit 50 it’s over thank you for clearing that up 
---
If you need 80 rounds for an enemy, you're doing something wrong.
---
Work on your build/gear.
---
how exactly are ppl planing to open a store? must they use 3rd party medium like forum or sub to advertise? or home random player will just show up and browse? you can only browse one person at a time, doesnt sound very doable...
---
According to the Overseer's holotape in the airport, the Scorched eventually petrify. That's why so many of them are stationary until we run up on them.
---
r/unexpectedfuturama
---
That's my plan! And I do have the prime rec for it. I need to farm some fusion cores, but good call on using the half filled ones. How can I pick which one it uses? Put the lvl 100s in a bag? 😂
---
It also boosts other effects, like explosive bobbleheads 
---
Yeah, after 50 at each level up you're given the option to either rank up a card or move a skill point.
---
Oh ok, thanks for the fast comment
---
Someone also said with a perk u can overfill them? 
---
Honestly probably just lucky. Not many people actively hunt other players to begin with, and even less of those people probably know all the tricks. 
---
The other day a friend had a workshop with several extractors which were unlocked and available for anyone to use and a player came along and destroyed everything then left. My friend still owned the workshop and it was being attacked by mole-rats so she went back and defended it then rebuilt most of the extractors and the jerk came back again and destroyed what was there. People are assholes and their pleasure is your displeasure.
---
so double the damage of the gun?
---
I doubt that Bethesda will avoid taking people's money. Probably going to have a Disney take on limited time items. 30 years later and you can finally buy that one skin!
---
If you already have some Combat Armor and the MATs, I can make them all BOS for you.
---
I can also make you the Shielded Soldier, Knight, or Officer under-armors, and the T-60 BOS paint.
---
Yeah. But I think explosive should stay at whatever it is now, like 20%
---
Boring people get bored.  It's the way of the world.
---
So was my post pulled?
---
At least I can "reserve" a spot in line while I'm at work. We may have the world's worst roads, but I can at least give them money much quicker than other states. Lol
---
I tried to tell people this before the nerf. There was nothing wrong with the TS it just didnt need to explosive mod on it. 
---
So you will just get back to it being stupidly op again. 
---
What? Just ignore. We don't need a setting for this.
---
100% worth it on all levels.
---
In real life I totally agree. But when you're online in a videogame It's not really the same. Griefing is a normal part of online games though, you can't expect everyone to act like you would.
---
Where is this explicitly stated?
---
You can get two fusion cores from Line in the Sand guaranteed. Grab half charged ones from the fusion generators in the environment, but I'm sure you know that.
---
And yeah.... You have to put the full ones in a bag/stash ;)
---
Oh, side note, don't forget Martial Artist perk.
---
I like to drop spare plans in cash registers at the train stations. :)
---
How. With TSE it was like 2 times dmg. So it’s worse, but not such an extreme nerf
---
Yes I’m aware of that but how quickly I died shouldn’t have been possible 
---
Ill pm you I don't want it blowing up 
---
&gt; the moth eggs nerf
---
Second time I've heard this -- please explain.
---
No but I wish I could do a two shot downvote on this idea.
---
Don’t know why you’re getting downvotes, i average 15 minutes solo and sort of take my time.
---
Yeah. It’s just the explosive
---
When they nerfed it they basically said they'd take a look at the effects later or something. Maybe they'll buff it in the future. Probably not. But there's hope, because Bethesda is vague.
---
😂 I can dig it
---
With TSE it is more than 2x damage. And double base damage for a single start is the best modifier you can have. 
---
You want steel? Please take some steel.
---
Classic RWA thinking.
---
 Go look in the rail car west of Watoga Station. BOS plans spawn on the crates by the corpse there. There is an Assultron kinda watches it so a little care is good. ;)
---
I know it’s I’m the game I meant her health coming back to full
---
According to another user, the inside is filled with cat pictures lmfao 
---
I found 4 explosive weapons legit and built my character around them. I was hit hard. I was just trying to be helpful and letting him know rifles can do better...
---
What better way to repopulate Appalachia?
---
It's worth also mentioning that Cranberry Relish gives a 10% xp buff as well :)
---
I like to stack the following buffs for xp farming:
---
Well rested: 5%
---
Cranberry Relish: 10%
---
Perk: Inspirational (Max): 15% (when in a team)
---
30% increase in total :)
---
Happy buffing!
---
I am not hoarding anything, but I have two characters in excess of 120 lvl that are constantly playing catchup with the weight. 
---
Last three weeks, my "playing" was basically me logging in, doing the vendor rounds selling as much stuff as I could and then logging out.
---
It's so bad the last few days that I've hit 25k caps, no junk in storage, and have only 3 star legendaries on my stash. So, even if I find someone to sell it to, on reddit of course because an actual f&amp;&amp;*ng in-game marketplace is too much to ask - I wouldn't be able to as my cap stash is maxed out. I am not going to throw away these legendaries - you know the only real reason to keep playing - because I am "incentivized". Fuck that. I will stop playing and maybe come back to it if content is released for free.
---
Fallout 3 and new vegas were RPGs with a tolerable engine.
---
Fallout 4 was a shooter with the most linear playthrough since mario
---
Fallout 76 is a gimped fallout 4 with rehashed content. I loved it but let's not lie to ourselves. There absolutely is nothing left to do.
---
Or perhaps drop some shit so you can play. No fix needed. 
---
id much rarher TS be 50% and  no explosive mod the  nerf to explosives was totally a shit choice. because of how weak explosives already wear and the fact of the high risk blowing yourself up  and shit. if anything just remove explosive mod from guns but keep it on things that would be an explosive weapon. 
---
Second time I loaded my game a guy in full x power armor jumps and emotes for me to follow him. He gave me a full firebreathes set, two gas masks, lots of recipes and plans, and some cosmetic stuff. The people in this community are amazing once you get past all the hate. 
---
I got the paints &amp; like 4 bomber jackets. Watoga Municipal Center pretty much guarantees a tech data from an orange cabinet.
---
Red dead online is way worse, you can literally lose hours of progress when someone kills you right before you sell a bunch of 3 star pelts. But again, it's in the nature of online games which is why I stay away from them in general.
---
In FO4 I have a full strip joint with a bar, disco lights, stripper pole, and hookers. Its name was "Rad Kitty." I loved those mods.
---
What's Youtube?
---
sell or dump stuff, your over weight by choice by the sound of your post. the armor increases weight carry but your toon needs more to do what you want. 
---
But it would still make the gun to powerful. Particularly compared to other legendary effects.
---
I was right at lvl 50 when the nerf came into effect, i i kept going now im lvl 80, over the cours of 30 levels i have 100% changed my build , it takes time but its worth it, i wouldnt start over lvl 14 is still reeeallllyyyy young lol
---
Weight Max as in 1500 lbs?
---
Yeah, this is one of few events where you are only gated by how fast you can do it. I think two people coordinated could do it in less than 7min.
---
I’d say more than 25% but less than 100%.  I don’t know. 40-60% more?  Additional bullets are logically less accurate/effective so some diminishing returns are appropriate and some nod to balance is necessary. The additional ammo isn’t much of a downside compared to the other legendary affixes, especially if you save it for the times when the extra damage really counts. 
---
Just find a new way to one shot, there's a few still viable options. You can't argue with the nerf everything crowd, skirt around them till all possibilities are nerfed. Maybe it will be good by then, but long enough for me personally to loose interest in a game.  
---
It's very frustrating for those of us who now need to restructure their builds. I'm sure you understand that explosive wasn't even an OP perk without TS and didn't need to get nerfed into the ground, same goes for TS without explosive.
---
I find it easier to just spend a day &amp; claim 2 workshops 😂😂 I'm lazy. They add up pretty quick tho. I do it once every two weeks or so. But yes, I do grab all the cores from PA &amp; generators I see, but unless I'm in need, I don't go looking for them. 
---
Hey everyone best place to find concrete is monorail elevator. South appa go to 3rd level (the tip top) follow stairs to the monorail train and on the other side of train on the side of walkway and tunnel leading too youll find at least 7 to 9 bags of concrete
---
You can make a full set? How did you get the plans?
---
I've seen this kind of thing happen when you Replace walls.  Specifically replacing with brick walls, which are a bit thicker than the others.  Wall Decor will just be halfway stuck in the wall and you can't even select it.  Storing/scrapping the whole wall should fix it.
---
Oh god. No wonder it doesnt actually fly. It uses the skeleton of an enemy that cant even do so...
---
How about the vendors just having more caps. No perk requirements, no S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats prerequisites. Just more than 200 caps for quality of life's sake.
---
Well.  Today I saw the plan on Phoenix.  Haven’t found Taggerdy.  Seems it’s just random if it is there or not.  
---
yeah im fucking tired of videos like "sjw are angry at doom eternal" with an NPC image in the thumbnail, when their "proofs" are some random tweets from a random person complaining about some random shit. Always the same YouTubers, always the same copypasted videos, always the same gaming circlejerk.
---
You can drop it on the ground in a secluded spot while crouched so people can't see you on map. Drop something worthless first to make sure your bag will stick. Hope this helps. Unless this is like a duper trying to make it easier for themselves
---
Well don't I feel a fool. Apologies.
---
Yes! Happy gaming to you and your wife!
---
Thats just it, though: At no time was it hard. I never felt challenged. The sonic attacks barely do damage and the Mothman does nothing else at all. Just vanishing and annoying stagger.
---
Nothing about it was hard. It was just annoying.
---
If it's one large bulk amount, it might weigh too much. Try putting a smaller amount of it in.
---
It’s a good idea ;) 
---
Hell yeah!
---
Well I wouldn't say it's an absolute need but I buff it up a little cause most time you have to fight enemies that have ranged weapons so I use Endurance to help survive till I get close enough to them 
---
Ah yes. The classic Low IQ moms basement gamer response. 
---
Except that you notice I never said it was HARD. Just annoying. Perhaps you should 'git gud.' Maybe start with reading comprehension?
---
Beat comment of the day
---
Ugh.
---
Yeah, unfortunately.
---
You can’t server hop and collect enough to sell
---
To the vendors anymore..you can only grab one amount per day now
---
Yeah, you definitely got screwed.
---
Ghoulfoot. 
---
I'd be fine with a slight increase. Like right now I have a full stash and inventory because I am hosting a community event tommorow (Flatwoods Farmers Market! Shameless plug) and I just found a anti armor gatling plasma I'd like to give away tommorow but I have no room for it. A secret stash would let me pass it to my alt 
---
“spotted me through three walls” had me howling!
---
I stopped using my explosive shotguns before the nerf was announced. Dropped them in a lake, actually. Got bored as they were waaay OP. I even made a post about it. Check my post history if you want. Explosive needed a nerf real bad. TS did not, I agree. 
---
Simple modern is my favorite one in the game
---
You can only collect one amount of eggs now to sell per day
---
No, the game shouldnt be adjusted because you somehow justify carrying so much garbage
---
Kinda useless comment. When you get bored, do something that doesn’t make you bored lol
---
Yeah ive been killed while not in PvP once before and it is annoying was just pointing it out incase you didnt know
---
TLDR : Op likes a walk
---
So you can TRY to decimate. I guess for non melee builds sentinel would would be better, but cavalier for melee perhaps 
---
hmm so the stash can only hold a certain weight limit of each item?
---
Did it have a pen attached by two rubber bands?
---
Personally, I'm proud of the pun in the first two sentences but thanks. :D
---
Except working on better gear may involve shooting things with his current bad gear. It’s a bit of a trap. 
---
Skeet Shooter is Perception, Enforcer is Agility. So it's got a healthy mix.
---
400? Good god dude it's there now for 1944...
---
Maybe write out a summery, I don't care to support a video if it's way out of line.
---
Monangah depends on what's there. Ghouls or scorched is bloated glowing, mole miners or liberators is garbage. Have to check what's spawning there before you nuke it. 
---
This guy is a legend.  Excellent creativity!
---
You're not in the minority on here, it's a common complaint.  PvP is up next which makes the most since, even though it's unpopular with a lot of people.  PvP has more replay value than PvE.  They need to keep a constant stream of people to playing to justify continued development.
---
After that vaults are 100% confirmed.  I would also be very surprised if we don't see more nuke triggered raids sooner rather than later.  But the game has only been out 2 months.  It's perfectly acceptable to take a break and come back when more PvE content is added.
---
Good to know ill have to look before i buy next time
---
If you're trying to add everything at once it sometimes won't work
---
Add shit in one at a time
---
Minutemen aren't a thing in the world at this point and last i checked the outfits nothing similar is in the game. Might be in a tom shop at some point or you can try confederate/union outfits for at least some vibe going there.
---
&gt; For those that are gonna comment here you have no issues with your stash and downvote leave us a list of what you got that you feel is adequate for your game play while still being able to collect items from the game. 
---
I don't think the stash is adequate at all.   When it comes to carry weight in general, a sort of disturbing pattern emerges. 
---
Tell me, why are calibrated shocks for the X01 nearly impossible to find? Because one on each leg increases your carry weigh by 50, for a total of 100 extra carry weight. 
---
When Bethesda increased the stash  size to 600, they said they hoped to increase it again in the future, but wanted to make sure that 600 didn't effect the stability of the game. 
---
Then suddenly things started to make sense.  Calibrated X01 shocks are damn near impossible to get because they want as few people  as possible to have then, because the more stuff people are able to have in their inventory the less stable the game is.
---
These these constraints, which make the game much less fun, are due in part to their dated game engine. 
---
Ok I look thanks 
---
I carry all the items. Never fast travel.
---
Yeah cause those huge rivers we have are gonna support this..but strange enough I could see a crazy side quest with this..like break a dam to flood it down the river 
---
Very nice, well thought out.
---
One of my characters mains shotguns. And in my many hours I have spent farming, I can unequivocally say that there is ABSOLUTELY NO PLASTIC FARM at Morgantown High School. Please, nobody waste your time going into the gymnasium there.
---
They shouldn't considering they are limited time and this isnt fortnite. But if the player base keeps dropping I could see them coming around again.
---
Na man.
---
If the reason is cuz it's not good enough.
---
Look at other sources of damage in the game. 9pts gets you 60% but a affix should give 100%?
---
And before you cry about melee that'll get a balance pass too.
---
As someone who enjoys pvp from time to time, I don't think restricting it would be the best thing for now. It'll be interesting to see how pvp is going to be affected when survival mode comes out though. It seems like the majority of pvp is done in workshops now, along with bounty hunting and some people running around leveling camps. One of the biggest drawbacks of having workshops is that someone can come in and take it over at any time - disabling pvp in workshops would take away a lot of the tension and risk that comes with it.
---
Unfortunately, Hunter/hunted and pvp events aren't nearly active enough. Maybe restricting pvp to them in pve servers would let them see more action, but I don't think people would like being forced to do them as the only way for pvp for the time being. There really should be a better incentives or rewards for participating in them, and I hope the feedback Bethesda is getting from events affects these too. At the moment there's hardly any incentive for pvp outside of workshops for a handful of caps and junk.
---
OP brings up a good point - pvp in its current state is extremely unbalanced, and the bugs with it (like people getting stuck on a sliver of health then having their health bar reset, which I've personally encountered a lot lately) don't help it much. In most cases, people one or two shot each other after slap damage is dealt by both sides, whether it's melee or TSE (which is still strong after the patch) - unless one of them is using Assassin's + Sentinel's gear with the dense mod for explosives, in which case they're nearly invincible when standing still. This makes sense since someone who builds for and gears up specifically for pvp should have an advantage over someone who doesn't, but I think the two legendary effects stacking is rather OP, much like having both Two Shot and Explosive on a gun. After level 50, it mostly comes down to gear, so there isn't much difference stat wise between a level 50 and a level 150, making it an even playing field IF both people are geared up for it. That being said, there isn't much a level 50 with a crafted hunting rifle and power armor can do when a level 200 with a TSE gatling and a full set of Assassin's and sentinel's armor decides to come along and destroy their base or take over their workshop.
---
There's been a lot more camp griefing lately and the victims can't even fight back because of that, or hacking. The day before the patch I came across a wanted level 126 destroying a group of level 30's camp near whitesprings. The level 30s tried fighting back but hardly did any damage and were getting one shot by the guy who had an explosive shotgun. He also had the marine armor helmet (the dev room one, not the tactical one that's already in the game, meaning he got it from hacking or from someone else who was hacking). Then they started running at him while taking slap damage so he would blow himself up which worked twice. After that, they ran at him but he didn't die - his health would go down to 1 and regen back to full after a couple seconds.
---
I hope pvp gets more balanced and bugs get fixed by the time the pvp mode comes out - it'll be dead on arrival if it's the same as it is right now.
---
Yeah but you could say the same about heavy. It's got perks in luck and intelligence. 
---
I tried that.....I don't really want to have to click 450 times to add 450 rubber to my stash lol
---
Wait...WHAT?!
---
[January 10th patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aejlcj/fallout_76_january_10_patch_notes/):  
---
&gt; “Hardened Mass” will no longer be scrapped when “Scrap All Junk” is selected.
---
it's not gonna happen. all the other legendary mods give at max +30% dmg. it is balanced this way
---
Ignore that roadmap. Its not even possible to follow it
---
Very cool idea.
---
Imagine if instead of fast travel we had vertibot transport on set paths between major hubs, or working automatic railroads on a schedule 
---
Taking workshops regularly, I’ve been assassinated once (two-tap snipe) and exchanged deaths with an attacker in a team-defense firefight. It’s not common but it happens. In neither case did the attacker take the workshop. 
---
Oh, how so?
---
#ultracitecores
---
#craftsome
---
I'm having the same issue. I thought it was because I have a legacy explosive gatling laser/gatling plasma.
---
A build guide is strongly recommended so you don't waste your perk points and have to spend a ton of time redoing your build later on. As for casual solo, I am doing just that and having a grand time.
---
lack of end game content, mid game content and early game content. This game just doesn't have much to it. It's like 8 quests and a bunch of "these skeletons are hugging" environmental storytelling.  It's got so so so much less to do or see than any other fallout or elder scrolls game. Which is crazy since it's not like it has characters or dialog or anything. 
---
The *iconic* feature of this fallout at least to me is versatility. I pretty much stay on my same character at level 170 as I can pretty well switch up to the perks I want the most when I feel I need them. If my original Xbox hadnt died I would easily be pushing 300. I play solo more times than not and 1 shot just about everything. PvP is really the only time you will want a team imo.
---
Thanks. No applause please, just throw money.
---
1,150c. Are you on today?
---
1) No, build however you want. Following a build guide will end up making you too powerful and the game will get boring. However, do explore builds and perks and such and learn from them.
---
2) Yes, you can play solo just fine. However, playing with friends (either real life friends or ones you meet in-game) is more fun 
---
I'm just trying to figure out the reason behind switching out cards at all. As soon as we learn a new skill, our brains forget an old one or two other skills?! 
---
Each generator eats up the same amount of budget, regardless of its output. A small cost you just as much as a fusion.
---
I am curious as to how much weight you had and if you used the carry weight exploit?
---
here we go again with the free karma from the dupers, enjoy it but rest assure, it is never going to be buffed again :)
---
1500 plus your normal carry.
---
The worst thing is when they manage to burrow through the ground and follow you onto top of a BUILDING. Because no kidding, this happened to me once in Charleston. How it is even physically possible for a molerat to dig its way through brick, concrete, and steel, onto the top of a damn building, I don't know. But those bastards surprised me out of nowhere and I accidently fell off the side of the building trying to dodge them, dying upon impact.
---
Goddamn molerats.
---
I mean at least name it right.
---
"The Elite Gentlemen's Club"
---
or "Southern Exposure" (For the poor white rednecks)
---
or even "Lady Godiva's" (If you want to be roofied by the bar staff.)
---
Last night, he showed up outside of the Charleston Fire Department.  I think that I've seen in this area more times than any other location.
---
I was playing for about 6 hours after not playing all week.  I rarely see him when playing for 1 to 2 hours.  
---
1. Not really.  Eventually you'll want to optimize for your play style, but you can move stats around after lvl 50.  So just build what you like and change what you don't.
---
2. Yes, the only think that really requires multiple people is the Scorchbeast Queen Raid. 
---
You don't you click click once then add like 100 ect
---
Try using a lever action rifle. Same ammo, more damage. Keep the combat rifle for less spongy monsters (as it has better ROF).
---
Reminds me of Frost on fallout 4. That was really tough at the start. Keeps ya fit though.
---
I picked up a metal chest piece that was inferior to the metal chest piece I wear. I wanted to scrap it and hopefully learn deep pockets. Went to my inventory and I was wearing the inferior chest piece.
---
WTF?
---
This may sound stupid, but is there any way to not PVP? Like is there any non-PvP zones to play in?
---
That's amazing. How the hell does he have such a large budget?
---
Does it benefit from the Friendly Fire perk?
---
Use character guides as just that - a guide based upon someone else trying things out, but fine tune it your own play style.  I am on my 3rd character since the B.E.T.A. As I am still learning what works.
---
You can play solo for much of the game,  but the higher lvl, harder parts will require team mate(s).  Only a very few have solo’d a Scorch Beast Queen, and lived to tell the tale.  You can identify them by their scars and missing limbs and hearing aid...
---
1) it’s better to get a rough idea of a build. Do you wanna use melee weapons ? One handed or 2 handed ? Pistol, shotguns, rifle, heavy weapons ? Do you wanna be sneaky or go all out in a power armor ?
---
When you get an idea of the type of character you wanna play, picking your perks will be easier. You don’t have to min-max but if you want you should probably worry about that when you get near lvl 50
---
2) yes you can totally play solo and casual
---
It wouldn't be such a stretch though. George Washington was all over West Virginia, lots of historical revolutionary war things all over the place. No reason not to have apparel from the revolutionary war.
---
It's bugged this patch. You'll get random notification if anyone near you has it equipped. So possible it was both your and his procs 
---
Once I started selling nuked fauna two vendor Bots and buying lead and steel in bulk, life got easier. Perx you're going to want: Green Thumb, hard bargain, ammo Smith, super duper, good with salt
---
Yes, but was it built in a day?
---
I would say this game is more focused on the casual gamer, then power players. A planed out build is defiantly going to be more efficient though.
---
Same on PS4. I changed to psychopath in the meantime.
---
^this i got a quad plasma that came with flamer barrel great for clearing out a group of lvl 40'ish ghouls. what really sucked for me with flamers was the first Explosive weapon i found was a flamer ended up just selling it partly cause of the ammo pain it would of been(other part would of been me most likely just killing myself with it nearly everytime i could of used it lol)
---
Fist weapons only have one perk card. Instead of three like rest of weapon choices. So I built one tanky. Using auto pistols as a change in pace. Normally only use it to take shots at sb tho. I use the terrain and mutations to avoid a lot of damage as I close in and instigating prefix on a deathclaw gauntlet equals good night enemies. Also the nuke zones are only time I use power armor and have slugger lvl 3 to swap out for iron fist when I  Go n them. Prob my fav build. 
---
That’s a cool idea. I might have to copy it! I set mine back a bit so I could put a switch, in case mutie buddies didn’t want to scrub rads. At this point I’m afraid just to move the thing. Installing it was a nightmare that involved switching from a single stair up from the bottom to the long base that’s there now. I actually preferred it before because it looked more like a floating tree house, but I just had to install my arch!
---
Protective and Shielded Marine and Raider Lining Plans have always been environmental drops, not vendor items. Try Savage Divide events like Uranium Fever to get Raider Lining Plans to drop.
---
Buy several copies of fallout 76. . . . Oh wait you said screws not screwed. =p
---
The packrat perk to reduce junk weight doesn't affect the weight in your stash, so you might be trying to transfer too much even though it looks small enough in your character inventory.
---
Any basic hunting rifle he could craft for cheap would do better than 80 rounds.
---
I could probably kill a glowing gulper with 5 .308 rounds.
---
I suspect his build is full of dead perks and he's not using VATS.
---
When I say gear, I don't mean that gear is going to fix a crappy build, I mean that once you've fixed your build, you can mod your weapons to fit it (AP cost, crit dmg, etc...). And then you can look for the legendary effects that would fit and mod that weapon.
---
I get the game locking up once a day now. It didn't used to do this. 
---
It's not 10% it's 110% and yes no blueprints.
---
is this uh, on PC..? just curious
---
Everywhere else is good for flux farming.
---
It tries to put in whatever you tell it to, if all of what you select weighs too much none of it goes in.
---
There are Confederate and Union soldier outfits in game, but the "Minute Men" is a specific group that hasn't been founded yet in the time line.
---
Theres the Pacifist mode
---
I wonder if it caps at some point? They are so unclear about the whole thing it’s really tough to tell. 
---
What's funny is that your camp shows up in the world the moment you join. I have a secondary mule account and noticed my main's camp immediately spawns...and get attacked by super mutants. It takes about a minute or so for your own camp to show up for yourself, as you said. But everyone can see it
---
Well I’m not on discord. Thanks, but the point of this post is that we should have in game means to create an economy. 
---
I'm home here now.
---
Can please have visual indicator you are drowning? I heard some maybe gurgling sounds but had no idea how much breath i had left and then suddenly respawn? 
---
So some little thing showing how close you are to being dead would be super appreciated.

it was 1944...
---
You can't bank levels then spend them on higher level perks.
---
Say you wanted 2 perks that unlock at level 10. If you save your point from gaining level 9 then gain level 10 that perk won't show up till you spend the point from level 9.
---
The roadmap ignores that entirely.
---
Not having turrets and water purifiers helps a lot. You are able to build rather large structures without that stuff
---
Good luck and see you in the wasteland 
---
Set it up as a component search. Theres a bunch of stuff that has screws that you wouldnt think would have them. 
---
Have a screw in your inventory, select it, press whatever button shows for component view and then tag it for search. 
---
Screws are everywhere. 
---
I still like this game
---
If your trying to put a stack of items over 148 lbs it will say "Stash is full" but you can but 148 lbs worth of the stack in.
---
Just turn on pacifist mode, under settings / gameplay something. They can’t hurt you. 99.99% of the people you run past are friendly in any case. 
---
I'm gonna put engines on it and fly it to Boston
---
No
---
That’s dope 
---
This has been happening for ages to me, it's normally somewhere around emptying one gun in a fight and switching to another before reloading and the other one gets the magazine size of what you were firing. It's interesting when you switch from the Gatling Gun with the 500 round mag to a Combat Rifle that HAD a 30rnd mag but now has 500.
---
Just got another pack today, hit 130, and every one was a duplicate of max rank cards, I now have a lvl 1,2 and 3 fix it good among others.
---
The only outfit that i've got from quests, are the bos scout bos scientist and BoS Bomber
---
It's both they need to be focusing on bugs and content simultaneously to keep people around
---
Let it go?
---
They had to have nerfed the shit out of the legendary characters.  I played several hours today including a nuke zone.  Acquired the most bad ass wooden leg.  WTF Bethesda. 
---
Funny how you assume everyone that gets mad at the nerf is a duper. 
---
Omg yes im not the only person to do this i just did it earlier and felt so stupid lol.
---
I’ve been killed numerous times because of this. Some areas that we load to can have enemies close by already killing you before you know What happened. I’m not counting the times I logged out in Whitespring. That’s on me.
---
Just a glitch had it happen to me a handful of times
---
It's a dental conspiracy, their sponsored by Crest.
---
There is a youtuber, RifleGaming, which has a series on nuking different locations.  But there's no list that I know of.
---
Relax, you’re only level 16. 
---
&gt; You can't please both.
---
I mean, you could by making a better game in the first place, but that's kind of a moot point by now.
---
I want a window seat
---
Current shitstorm should end where all the banned people or those who can't dupe will move on, so in a month or so, real challenge will be how fast they can deliver new content for people.
---
Go to Charlestown train trader if he's not there go over too the metal bridge and log out if he's not there repeat. Most common spot I've seen him spawn 
---
There is pacifist mode....But it is kind of broken. It only stops you from doing damage to players, It doesn't stop them from damaging you granted they will be doing reduced damage it can still be annoying. Best to just switch servers if you get attacked and avoid claiming workshops
---
I stopped using my explosive shotguns before the nerf was announced. Dropped them in a lake, actually. Got bored as they were waaay OP. I even made a post about it. Check my post history if you want. Explosive needed a nerf real bad. TS did not, I agree.
---
Yeah I still haven’t played it yet. I’m pretty casual but every now and then I get in the zone and play really hard. I still have coffee stains on my teeth from when I played Overwatch for 3 months and drank more coffee than I have ever consumed. Not sure why, but the only time I’m competitive is during online FPS situations. Everything else just feels like “I’m here cause mom said I have to.”
---
Oooh ok that’s stupid lol
---
Sounds like Bethesda or EA right now. They will take your cash but give you an unfinished product
---
LAUNCHING NOW 
---
Fallout 3 changed my gaming experience for the better, Aside from Morrowind it's the first game I felt truly free in. 76 is a good game, it just has alot of room for improvement. 
---
From the events? I thought that was from technical data
---
What's blitz? 
---
 It changed Fallout 4 completely. I played it for probably another couple of hundred hours more than I would have using fast travel. It seemed that might work for 76 too and it does.
---
 You have to make plans. You have to think about the places you need to get to and how to string that together into a useful trip.
---
I couldn’t hazard a guess as to what Bethesda will add to the game next.
---
Not only that, but due to nerfs and patch debacles allow us to break up cards into single increments.  I’m now all about managing weight and weapons breaking.  Fuck me
---
They made a mistake by not having a character weight limit on day one, for the very same reasons that they have a stash limit. Now they've predictably corrected that mistake, but they still let you carry a lot more than you can stash.
---
Drop the less important stuff like unused ammo in a container such as luggage or a cash register so you have room to scrap/craft the rest.
---
Hahahahhahahaahha them implementing anything useful at this point? Crazy talk. They should just turn control over the entire game to the nodding community and we might have a decent game in 2 months 
---
Plz I live in a bus I'm living it up 😏
---
It would seem best used on a fast firing weapon.
---
That’s a great idea !!!  I have one that’s some what different but to the same ends , why can’t your stash reflect the perk bonuses that your character has ??example :batteries included at 2 stars -fusion cores weigh only 1.2  pounds but as soon as you put it in your stash it goes up to 3?? Same thing with pack rat most junk is at .003-.001 in stash 1-4 pounds . Your stash should reflect your perks and if for some reason you change or remove the weight saving perk (traveling pharmacy,power armor user, thru hiker etc)reverted stash would return back to your character . Is that even easy or feasible to do ? I don’t write code so I’m just throwing it out there.
---
Relying on one weapon using one caliber of bullets is just a recipe for problems.  What happens when you get into a long fight and your weapon breaks?  Even if you have a ton of bullets, they aren't going to help.
---
When I was relying on bullets I had at least 3 different guns that took different caliber of bullets.  At least have a second weapon that uses a type of bullet that you find a lot of in the game.
---
It was a perk that teleported you to enemies when you used VATS to melee them, and gave you a massive damage boost proportional to distance traveled. 
---
From what I saw, with this latest patch they mentioned looking over heavy and energy weapons and giving them proper buffs.
---
" We’re doing an audit of heavy weapons damage and their ammo weights. We plan to increase damage in light of the perk and mod reductions, and  plan to reduce ammo weight to make heavy weapons generally more viable.  These adjustments will roll those out in a future update. "  
---
" We've heard and share your feedback that energy weapons need to be brought inline with other weapon types. We're also looking to adjust laser weapon durability in a future update. "  
---
Weapons to break down for mods usually
---
Hint: crafting a new flamer nets 100 fuel. Its actually easier and cheaper to craft a whole new flamer just for the fuel. 
---
Dupers sold them for less. It was profit no matter what price they sold them.

Just getting home. Give me like half an hour &amp; I’ll be on!

It's not mine but I am going to say, those who hate fallout 76... GO SOMEWHERE ELSE GOD DAMNIT MOVE THE HELL ON OK , I CANT ENJOY A DAMN VIDEO, POST OR SOMETHING WITHOUT SEEING A DAMN TOXIC PERSON OR HATER! Dude I understand you ain't happy, but it is seriously ennoying, really ennoying. The game is far from good and Bethesda is bad, but hey I still play it. I had no bugs in fo3, fo4, and 76 just a little lag. As for all the rest, I give you the example of stupid fortnite. They vault something, mad for 2-3 days, then oh it's alright we don't give it's alright epic games good decision. Fallout balance changes, THIS GAME IS TRASH I AM GONNA UNNISTAL IT AND GONNA HATE ON IT. Look I am just tired of all this useless hate, I understand shit happened but move on! Don't hate forever, some people still enjoy it... I like playing the game, but when I go on yt or reddit all I hear and see about fo76 is just  hate and trash. 80% of all fallout 76 videos on yt are 2 months old! Sorry for long post but I just can't hold it anymore, had to say it... It isn't the dev side of fallout 76 or either the games fault, go hate on ZeniMax and Bethesda if that would make you guys feel better. Look I don't defend this whole case but this drama has lasted long enough and needs to be finished, just wanted to know the opinion of others on this...
---
I just go the enclave bunker there’s a lot there
---
Many items like Mag's and bobble heads are "world spawns" with random spawn times and cool downs.  
---
Keep exploring and you'll find more..
---
I run with a normal Gatling Gun and Prime .50cal Suppressor/25% faster fire rate. The Gatling is good for pretty much anything at any range, it's not so great if you're getting overwhelmed at close range though. That's where the Prime .50cal comes in, it's tears up the whole mob at the Whitesprings Golf Club and I use on SB/SBQs when they're close to save on ammo. Violet Flux isn't hard to get, it's the Glowing Mass and Hi-Radiation Fluids that don't drop too often.
---
The Minigun, Auto Grenade Launcher and the rest are a bit of a waste though. Not enough damage for the ammo you get, ammo &amp; loot bugs on the energy varieties. The AGL is fun, but ammo weighs a lot and the magazine isn't big enough to be truly viable. Not sure about the Harpoon Gun or Broadsider though, haven't played with them much.
---
I'll be on the sub and playing the game long after people like you and OP have moved on to the new Call of Duty or whatever. 
---
Nerfing TSE and increasing cap costs was the best update they've ever done, just slightly ahead of closing carry weight glitches and cap stash exploits. It'll clear out the people that need easy mode options. They harder they make the game, the more I'm going to enjoy it. Sorry sweetie. 
---
"I'm level 5, where's my 3 star legendary?"
---
You mean my aid storage for food water chems and stims for all my characters to use? Lol
---
Bet, the wife is hot to trot so imma be a minute as well. C u soon
---
The disease Rad Worms is bugged so that everything, good or bad, is buffed 50%.
---
Explosive shotguns....yes.
---
We're talking about rifles here though. My radium was far from OP.
---
My shotgun and TSE minigun generally stayed in my stash box. That's want you do in Fallout if a gun isn't fun to play with. 
---
Bethesda fucked up big time catering to PvP players...... where are all of the posts about how awesome PvP is now post nerf?
---
What the guy said above you^^          
---
Manta man costume from the Atom Shop, skeleton mask from the Halloween house. 
---
The game is getting better and a balance is making its way. This doesn't mean they r doing the best job that could be done, or does it mean that it isn't buggy at times. If ur playing, u could actually feel there are improvements being made. Social media though love to bash it regardless.
---
Not between accounts, between characters on an account
---
you should try watching one of his shorter ones. joseph anderson is honestly one of the best game critics out right now
---
Taking forever to load in
---
I farm bones but buy flux in big bulks. 
---
I don’t think it’s possible to make one. We have no idea how the perks or legendary effects actually works..
---
Next level shite. 
---
True. I normally spam craft and scrap something I need a mod for. 
---
This would be great as well. If Mr. Prize-Bot can find me even deep in the Mire, Mr. Postal-Bot can easily do the same. Just make him unkillable, and if he should glitch out of the world, make him try again the next 'day'.
---
For sending the package, just re-purpose one of the information terminals present in every train station. Bonus option: let us send a package to anyone on our friends list (only if not exploitable!).
---
Plot twist: it's a dude character and there's no gurls, only tears. 
---
Did you know alle emotes do the old skyrim spellcast movement in firstperson? 
---
I never said anything about the nerf one way or the other.  You assume a whole lot without knowing me. Have fun believing you are better than everyone else just because you suck Bethesda's dick. I hope your life gets better.
---
OMG THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!
---
Meh! Fair enough..  😜
---
am i missing something?
---
I'm not that loyal of a bfs fan, I'm a die hard fallout fan. Actually hated Bethesda when they were fighting interplay for the rights to fallout online. Then I discovered interplay was bought out by some french company that fired everyone that made fallout and Bethesda spoke up in support of inxile that was what was left of black isle. Just think... If Bethesda did this poorly with 76... What steaming load of garbage was fallout online by interplay going to be?
---
This. I'm not clicking on YouTube links.
---
I have built my character to be able to play any style, from stealth sniper, to melee/shotgun, to VATS/critical, to power armor/heavy weapons, to adrenal/nerd/bloodied.   They are adequate at each, but not optimized for any single style.  You can swap out any three point perk card to swap styles.  
---
My recommendation for maximum flexibility:  S9, P9, E8, C4, I6, A9, L11–although A and L can be swapped.  
---
The L11 assumes Starched and Class Freak plus two three-point cards.   
---
S9 allows incisor plus swing speed and then 3 points for blocker (if low health build) or three one-point weapon improvement cards.  
---
Oooh possible, you’d have to the space...deathclaw cost about 25% budget...maybe SB cost 40-50%?
---
The previous patch really screwed mutations.  I thought my marsupial and healing factor weren't working but they just randomly started curing themselves. I have starched genes maxed and equipped but I saw it randomly pop up the upper left of my screen that I was cured of electrically charged. I checked my pip boy and they were gone.  3 mutations gone for no reason. 😞
---
Do they ever show up at vendors in bulk? I see springs all the time and have broken down to just buying them, but I need 16 screws at a time to make a gauss rifle to immediately break down to learn mods 
---
No.
---
This is really a scary scenario that could actually happen. From now on, I will wait a day before logging in after every updates just in case. 
---
Life is great! Thanks for asking. I'm still having a great time playing 76 too. You sound upset though. Maybe take up a more soothing hobby like knitting or going on long walks, you know, really getting in touch with nature and yourself. 
---
Barring that, I hear Call of Duty is on sale, might want to get a good price now.  
---
Currently got a megasloth and a fair bit of budget, I think I'll have to try it
---
I know right.... i wish i understood, no perks my tse handmade does 70damage or something, after its perked up and muatations and blah blah blah i sit at 293 on a min max build, with adrenaline at 5 star i can hit the 460 mark at times,  theres just no easy way of calculating that
---
Dang
---
Sure it makes logical sense. But it doesn’t make balance sense. Logically, it would shoot a second bullet and actually take a second bullet from your ammo count🤷🏼‍♂️. It’s wildly imbalanced compared to other legendary effects; that’s the problem. That’s why it was nerfed.
---
I'd get those plans drop on and off pre-patch, but I've never seen the plan for Deep Pocketed chest piece.
---
You can only have one at a time, additionally it has to be a random spawn, idk if SH technically are random spawns or hard spawns locations 
---
don't create this rumor lol.
---
most low level with these outfits are usually alt characters, that had the outfit transferred from their main characters.
---
or if it is the case of low levels, i can assure loads of my buddies would be loaded with them. As they do the events, but scarcely grind for exp.
---
The best way you can help is to continue submitting tickets, just because they dont respond does not mean its being ignored, good chance its being added to their bug tracker, and prioritized, unfortunately it may not have a high priority, for any number of reasons, there may just be higher priority items in front of it. 
---
I would suggest that you dont submit a novel of issues, submit one ticket per issue, make it clear and concise and leave all personal opinions and/or suggestions out of it. State the issue, state what you believe is the fix, leave some contact details, if or when they require more info, they will contact you
---
How many stars was it?
---
I would highly recommend just getting a 40s playlist going on Spotify or Google Play. You might discover a whole new bevy of tunes that you really enjoy. FO3 gave me a lifelong love of the era. 
---
Amen!! I’m a power armor exclusive user I have seven frames with different mods for the varying occasion . every time I need one it’s the armor show and tell hour!!!  having to pull them all out just to get one has become absolutely grating!!! How  F-ing hard is it for it say t-51 etc.????? This is like amateur hour at Bethesda it’s so basic yet we are begging for it with no response from them at all!! I think people are just fed up with it all , last night at around 11:45 pm pacific time I was in a sever all by myself till 3 in the morning till I finally logged off bored. what does that tell you Bethesda ??!!!
---
No problem, I love seeing unique builds for camps.
---
Theres absolutely no way in from the outside? I have been looking for a new place for my camp, I'm chilling on a lead deposit right now but I'm good for bullets for days
---
I like this guy. At least 300 caps with everything being as pricey as it is now.
---
I have the plan to make them as well as the prime receiver. If I remember correctly the plan for the gun dropped on the SBQ for me. 
---
Are you going to spend real money or the ATOMS cash you got from doing the challenges? 
---
What rumors lol
---
I must also be missing said thing.
---
I think there's a map of guaranteed spawns and I've seen them in other places not on the map like the mire, I think random spawn scorchbeasts do exist it's just a matter of finding one.
---
If Fisto aint here imma have to speak to a manager 
---
I feel you. I saw an item I've been looking for the whole game, an Instigating Super Sledge. Some schmuck had sold it to the a vendor and it was a paltry 300 odd caps. I almost pooped myself. 
---
...level 30. There is no justice in this world. 
---
Mmm hence why I'm asking for confirmation. It's widely believed by many people, but I'm asking if anyone actually has proof
---
Oof, that one hit hard.
---
Too bad Domino's Pizza can't patch it for us...
---
See they were making it. But bc you posted this, they now made sure it'll never be in the game
---
I have a mic wouldn't say it's the best Haha psn charlomander 
---
post nuke. When the nuke ends, it still spawns bloated for a while. then it resets after like 3 wipes.
---
Saw this on the brotherhood discord a while ago from one of our knights I think
---
Can confirm a similar bug with my Gauss rifles and cultists knives
---
Haha if you get it happen definitely post that 
---

---
As primarily a rifleman and grenadier, it was a little disappointing to get nerfed. Grenades keep me competitive when I happen into a high level environment other players left behind. (I'm only lvl 37)
---
Chris Brown  - "These hoes ain't loyal,,,,to the game... "
---
Interesting, that explains alot. Maybe the reason I still like f76 is it basically a copy of fo4 with online (no npc's yadayada..). The perk system is spot on I'll give them that, still can swap cards and retain a hard point system.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
---
Okay, that's fucking hilarious.
---
this was my first thought before the game launched. I assumed I could do better in game commerce and planned to build a brothel. I'm pleased to see someone that had the same idea and followed through.
---
My biggest problem is nerfing over fixing broken items. Seriously the game has been out for 3 months and they still haven't fixed a shit load of useless weapons yet continue to suck the fun out of the game by nerfing us into longer game play. 
---
lol if a youtuber sees this, they will throw in the caption
---
"Secret rare event outfit farm strategy" 
---
followed by 15 minutes of bull shit and 30 seconds of what you just wrote at the end.
---
Friend request sent, bthirst68
---
Considering they fixed that method, why are you even worried about that? Spewing about it with fear but it’s no longer a problem. This is the current state of this sub right now. 
---
Yup. When I get the chance I'll look at it and let you know the name of the workshop. 
---
Think it is intentionally done now that any modifiers can't touch your perk card in any way.
---
You know I was wondering why in well over 100 tries I’ve never come across calibrated shocks in the bunker  wtf!!!??? 
---
Interesting 
---
It took a while getting used to. Atleast after the nerf I kill myself alot less.
---
You're lucky I got some glowing meat from a 3* legendary charred ghoul
---
Either way, swing speed or hard hitting, they balance out nicely.
---
How about Pete Hines comes out of hiding instead.
---
Sometimes I just open up my map and look around... Oooo that person is in the middle of nowhere! Is that a camp!? Then I go. I see a cool camp. I wave, to get attention, take a little tour, give a thumbs up, and look for another 
---
Why not do it the way FO4 did it?
---
&gt; The **Two shot** modifier makes the weapon fire an additional projectile while still using only 1 ammo and at slightly reduced accuracy and can greatly increase recoil. The game adds the base (i.e. unmodded) damage of the gun to its current (modded) damage and then splits the combined damage evenly into two projectiles. For example, an unmodded [Hunting rifle](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hunting_rifle_(Fallout_4)) does 37 damage, while a .50 cal Hunting rifle does 64. So a Two-shot .50 cal Hunting rifle does 64+37 = 101 damage, resulting in two projectiles hitting for 50.5 each. 
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary\_weapon\_effects#Two-shot\_weapon\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_weapon_effects#Two-shot_weapon_effects)
---
And then not allow the Explosive legendary mod to be in the same list.
---
Except I haven't done that and have had many people stop by
---
One star. Only Furious. 
---
Yeah I don't get why so many perks have been nerfed, out of all nerfs only the tse one really made sense and off the top of my head I think the only buffs they've properly done was a small buff to automatic weapons and the buff to fireproof.
---
Probably adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage.
---
I want more endgame content as well
---
Exactly, At least Domino's patches don't break the product... 
---
It’s just a bandaid solution for a problem they probably won’t be able to fix honesty so I guess we’ll see. Just not gonna take the word of a company that has failed literally every way possible since the launch of this game
---
Well... this is still happening (PS4)
---
Good mornin u/thyazide!
---
Just glassin at your dad boner while taking a brown. Keep those jeans high and tight. Piss on me, beat me
---
Try it out try it out!

A man named... Johnny Guitar.

She better has trained slut lung, cant breathe when sucking on my.....ehhh worm.......

No but it took me like 3 hours to get the ball 100% sealed off. It can be done quicker if you don't mind having a human foundation shield that can still be shot through a bit.
---
Happy cakeday!
---
I have a base that no enemies or players can get to :-) its perfect
---
me too lol
---
Wasn't it Eminem that said "there's no such thing as bad publicity"?
---
I like how the disco ball is visible through the doorway. 
---
So I see Bethesda ignored my bug reports and all my bitching in this sub about the plethora of bugs in Social actively preventing teaming up or even joining a friend's server. Typical Bethesda bullshit. You're not getting me to come back to your buggy piece of shit game that way.
---
And why the fuck did it take you two months to come up with the pathetically short list of issues? WHY?! I've encountered more bugs you haven't listed than you have! My reports fell of deaf (or dumb) ears though. Why waste my time?
---
Everything looks normal except shouldn't the plants still be nuked flora?
---
More the merrier
---
Keep it, keep it! 
---
yeah I sometimes go crazy thinking I found a ultimate weapon or armor then im betrayed when I look at the level 
---
Wait until you hit lvl 100 and "notable loot" becomes that last piece of armor you need to complete a set, at this point worth more to you than caps you can even hold...
---
i craft loads of weapons for mods. Usually, i would do 15 of X weapon, then i would have to farm more junk.
---
I never have go over board with weight in the process. How about u manage what u r doing, rather than calling for a fix. Keep in mind, the limitations in place r too prevent dupers from duping. Eventhough they haven't succeeded in completely ending their shit, the game does feel alot better in terms of optimisation. It feels alot more fluid and disconnects have severely dropped. 
---
Let's keep it that way. Manage ur junk like the rest of us.
---
Added you but no response
---
When companies reaches certain size, they tend to go blind. I doubt anyone competent is staffed at support to deal with these issues. Bethesda has lost all contact to its customers, quite sad really.
---
Awesome, need it for my min max build, atleast i k ow it works! Thanks
---
Does Oxhorn have his own subreddit?
---
Yeah, i figured if i did two handed i would need to emphasize that power swing, whereas 1h i should be more mobile and swinging faster. 
---
They “fixed” it by setting the arty box to have a max weight of 0 thus preventing anything from being added. This “fix” would not work for OP’s suggested mailbox as it would make it useless. 
---
Yeah, too true
---
Well in the wasteland you have to improvise some game pieces. 
---
Then nuture it so It cant reproduced that's all we need is more of them 
---
I have an explosive black powder rifle which I usually open with if that doesn't one shot an enemy. That and a vampiric guitar sword for backup. Trouble is there's only so much you can carry.

I think it would be better to just let us build based on the cards. Make every special have a minimum of one point, a maximum of 15 and 56 points total.  The points in each special are based on cards in them and totals change as you change cards in and out. Allow for decks or load outs. If I want a melee build I can have it but if i decide to play an assault rifle build I can change to it. They could limit the number of decks or load outs like the mod perk load out manager does. They could even make it so you can't change in combat and give a cool down.  
---
Agree, I have done this on a couple of cards mistakenly, boy would it be nice if something like Ammosmith could be used multiple times...sooo many ammo rounds!
---
Train robbery events ...

Nerfing the explosives *perk* was a shit idea. Nerfing the explosive *legendary effect* was what needed to happen, or at least preventing two-shot and explosive from coexisting on the same weapon. Explosive should have always been a first-star effect.
---
Explosive weapons having a damage output like they had just let them make the cut. If you've ever tried keeping them in your loadout, you'd understand why.
---
Extreme carry weight per weapon, ridiculous costs to craft and then again carry ammo, the grenades bounce all over the fucking place even if you throw them into sand so unless your enemies are huddled in a corner you're not doing much with the things, the Fat Man's arc is fuck-all effective for reliably targeting and killing anything but yourself without having fired around ten expensive ass mini-nukes in very different situations to learn to use the frigging catapult, the Auto-GL has shit range and damage and may as well be a melee weapon, the regular GL is great to replace your rubberized frag grenades with but once again has no goddamn range, the Missile Launcher is literally the *only* actual effective weapon and it breaks almost as quick as the plasma gatling and it really only shines when targeting scorchbeasts.
---
Most people just used them for flavor considering the resources and kit burden they demanded for such low DPS but high AoE damage that could really be replaced (or even outpaced) with a tesla rifle or good automatic weapon. Those who put them to really good use were playing smart and using them like a proc, topping their Adrenaline damage bonus on adds and then turning around to blast down the SBQ. You know, real RPG tactics.
---
But Bethesda tunnel-visioned on that horrid fuck-up of theirs and put the smack down on two separate legendary effects that were reasonable alone and destroyed a weapon class in the process. For all the springs, screws, and nuclear material it takes and all the carry capacity I have to devote to my explosives and then be told struggling to have novelty pop guns is OP...just such a huge disconnect between developers and actual players in this game.
---
It's a small thing, but it reeks of a dead game. Either way I'm sticking around until I see flies gather.
---
I'd be more concerned about all the kids toys having lead in them.
---
I just finished the DMV quest yesterday, bugged out THREE times and it started completely over again. Twice coming back with the Governor's seal... True DMV immersion! 
---
Outstanding!
---
my bad
---
Does C.A.M.P in this situation mean Can Accept More Pen\*\*? Penny:\^)?
---
It's a Dev room item and having it puts you at risk of being banned. Players who have one and scrap it have 100% chance of learning to craft it. So you can get it without actually entering the Dev room but it's still a risk.
---
Shielded and protective lining plans aren’t from vendors and never have been besides the ones for operative underarmor. You get them from event drops. 
---
Thanks that must be it, as I had the rad worms...and now it is back to normal.  Thanks!
---
ikr
---
They haven't lied to me multiple times.  
---
I’m up for that. Add FahtEnn
---
Or even like Vault 76 opening back up and being a trading hub. To set up your own vendor bot to sell your stuff. Just an idea
---
This is how we rebuild Appalachia. We work together to rebuild our rail system. Get those whitespring bots to assist us. They're great at renovations.
---
Need ideas for group content endgame because youtuber are having a field day 
---
They’re all scorched kids, ghouls or bones already.
---
after loads of damage testing, if either two shot or explosives bumped up by an additional 20%, the result would b 1 shot again.
---
They had to go so low to prevent 1 shotting.
---
As it is right now, i can almost 2 shot players with the same tse weapon i was using post nerf.
---
Although, funny enough, bloodied explosives can 1 shot though. So their aim for balance is flawed lol
---
Catch me repairing my deathclaw gauntlet with bone toys for kids
---
I really appreciate y’alls hard word and commitment to improving the game and making everyone’s experience that much better!
---
You had a 400 cap bounty and were practically immortal which is what they do
---
Lol. No kidding 
---
Request sent
---
Here's my view.  At the lower levels you usually do not have enough carry weight to support the amount of bullets and repairs that you go through.  Plus, you need to be able to carry stuff to sell for fast travel, etc.  So, having the weight reduction perks are important.  
---
As for crafting, I find that being able to improve my weapons reduces the amount of bullets used, reducing the amount of lead that you need to find (it's a bit different with a melee build).
---
However, some people adhere to swapping and dropping.  Swapping out what you have for items that you find instead of repairing or modding.  But then breakage becomes unpredictable.  I like knowing that my weapon of choice is going to last a battle.
---
Of course, there is no wrong way in playing, it's just a game after all...  (grin)
---
It’s a legendary spring.. fits anything a spring will fit in..lolz
---
Pvp isn't this games thing. Not sure why the devs insist on it. This is co-op fallout for fucks sake!
---
razorgrain soup gives  30 hp..saves me using stimpaks..i do make other foods..for health regen ap regen etc..but mainly razorgrain soup
---
They easily could have made demo export not effecting TSE guns. That would have been all what's necessary to nerf them enough, and bobbleheads not stacking  of course.
---
Holy shit. Non sequitur. 
---
I feel like daily events should work like a normal event, but with a time limit. To the same time schedule as the daily challenges. So you can start and if you get knocked off a server, it doesn't loose its progress, or lose the ability to do a daily quest completely.
---
And yes, they should actually come up daily
---
Yarrrr I'm impressed sea dog.
---
yeh..i just hate to be untrusting and ask for caps. i like to think we all trustworthy
---
It is that way no npc could destroy it
---
It made sense to nerf them, not to nerf them literally as hard as possible. The 2 shot perk lost 75% of it's damage, and the explosive lost 80% and then the explosive perk got nerfed too. Both of my weapons are TSE and I'm not playing the game anymore until they put some real balance, otherwise I'll end up just giving my shit away and uninstalling. I'll give them some time. 
---
How it'll actually be implemented:  
---
1) You need a keycard to activate factory. It's sold in the ATOM Shop  
---
2) Effects last 10 minutes in game until they patch it, at which point it won't work at all  
---
3) Activating it will get you banned as an exploiter.   
---
Grafton station used to have them if you served hopped. I haven’t seen them since the latest patch tho so no idea where to get them besides getting combat armor plans from events then crafting/scrapping for mods 
---
i used a hunting rifle from lvl 10 to 70. I fully modded it and had a stealth build. Max sponge goes down in 5 shots. Reliable as fuck. As the guy said, fix ur build
---
I thought the whole reason for the nerf was to please the PvP players?
---
I haven't seen a single conversation about PvP since the update.
---
who me?  nah..lol..
---
I don't think people that wanted the nerf even played pvp. Fireproof patch pretty much took the edge off explosive weapons, nerf was rip. It was more the power armor folks wondering why still kept getting one shoted. Armor unbalance maybe? no couldn't be..
---
Unfortunately that's not a good solution. The problem is that you don't know whether it's being ignored/lost in the noise or it's been added to their bug tracker. Either way it leads to anxiety and frustration to the submitter cause it seems like they're not being heard, whether or not that's the case.
---
Even a message saying "hey we got the ticket" isn't enough because is it being addressed or is it being ignored?
---
I think the OP is taking the right approach because they've tried the other ways.
---
nah..just fees my team mates
---
I still remember the dipshit posts when this was changed. 
---
&gt; “I’d much rather wait 30 seconds than be a floating head.”  
---
Fuck that.  I hate catching a death I had no control over.  If I’m in the game world, I need control, floating head or not. 
---
You can just replace walls instead of scrapping.
---
Empath is my main mitigation on my bloodied. Works great.
---
no
---
The problem is we have submitted allot of these as tickets, and they persist.   
---
Many of the "small" things would be easy to resolve,  they are laid out start to finish.  
---
The fact they aren't addressed makes us feel like the work is going into a black hole.  
---
The previous thread  was to try and get their attention and get a response, but the answer of submit makes it feel like some twisted Limbo/the DMV... 
---
The whole reason the ticket submission is a thing is for people to use it to submit issues, and is more likely to be tracked then tweeting or PMing some random dev (who might even completely forget to mention it to the team, etc. seen this happen hundreds of times in the past). So people should be using it to do so, companies are not at liberty to have to respond to say anything, sure it'd be nice to receive some feedback, but they dont have to. 
---
Lead based paint
---
That goes for almost every weapon. Ammunition too expensive + durability too low + ammo usage is insane.
---
I was so happy when I got my first Laser Minigun, it was always my favorite weapon.
---
Insane Repair costs, breaks almost after shooting one fusion core, cant even damage a Lvl 40 Mirelurk Queen by 50% for those costs.
---
Another good example would be the Gatling vs. the Minigun. One is fucking useless garbage that just burns through your ammo storage and the other one is the Gatling.
---
It has a line that goes by whitespring but I know he walks right through it
---
Honestly, the more I think about it. The more unintelligent I feel Bethesda is. Obviously they want people playing daily, it means they rate better with the amount of players and regular players means more people to spend money at the atom shop. Why on earth wouldn't they have made they daily event, a random quest, that can be checkpointed, with a time limit to the daily challenges. And the reward would be a token. And say the tokens unlock rare outfits or weapons (much like fuzzy) with different factions or areaa
---
ATOMs from challenges. I've been saving 1800 for the day they have a skin I like for the X-01.
---
It looks bad.
---
I definitely am seeing less nuke zones now. The crowd that were upset about players 1 shoting legendaries may have shot themselves in the foot.
---
I don't hear or see anything suggesting that PvP is now tons of fun.
---
All I see is a ton of outrage about the nerfs. This may go down as the most epic overreaction in gaming history.
---
Cool, thanks. 
---
Gooood mooooooorniiiiinggg Juuuuliaaaaaa
---
Thats why i mentioned priorities. You and others might think its a high priority issue or its a small issue that could be resolved quickly (this would actually decrease its priority, and therefore delay the fix). But in the broader terms, it might just not be high enough priority for them to look at right now, or as I said, there might just be a larger number of existing high priority items for them to work on first.
---
Epic! 
---
And thanks for the laffs.. lolz
---
Calibrated shocks increase your carry weight. And maybe, the more carry weight everyone has... the less stable the game is?  Just a guess. going by their own words.
---
Excavator armor also increases your carry weight by 100, but you have to build it and it takes a lot of grinding.  You don't just get a full suit of it, like with the ultracite power armor.
---
That's why I always use the misc quest marker to make sure I'm getting the right one.
---
Yea. I wanted to change foundation too. You can’t replace that with walls on top of it, can you?
---
And I might be the minority here but my only problems are how the weapons break so fucking often and how it feels slow to level up...
---
Heck, I get three stars dropping flare guns and drills. They are sucking the life out of the game. 
---
I actually think PVP is better post nerf. I've had some pretty fun PVP sessions with people trying to take workshops.
---
Thats a good idea
---
I didn't think of that. I only had 2 adrenal reaction and no nerd rage.
---
and the bonus carry weight haha
---
I wanted the wanderer
---
All your friend has to do is make a 2nd psn for fo76. It doesn’t need to be ps+ as long as his main still has ps+ he can log on with the new psn on the same PlayStation. It sucks but if you want to play it is what it is. Don’t cheat 
---
There are games with nuclear material and all toys have lead in them. Ethics wasn't a thing in pre war fallout US. 
---
That I don't know. Sorry. Good luck.
---
Well, all Vendors are robots. All NPCs are robots. 
---
So Im for bringing back the "Ladykiller" (or whatever the skill for more dialogue options with the opposite sex was called).
---
But call it "Giddyup Buttercup Whisperer" or "Charming Machine" or anything like that.
---
But hunger rate is also through the roof so that’s a wash. 
---
Well screw that. Tried going east and almost instantly got attacked by three scorchebeasts at once. Died within seconds. Respawned and they followed me, so I died again. And now I've lost all my crafting resources I grinded hours upon hours for.
---
You say that, and if buy that if their response, canned or not, wasn't "We are looking into it".    
---
That implies they don't have a fix, are unaware of one, etc.   
---
Which circles back to the desire of having a way to submit tickets in a fashion that would not get lost in all the white noise. 
---
Someone was trying to tame theSBQ. Lolz
---
Tse is still the highest damage combo though, sure the perk didn't need it but I feel the effects are at a good place with a 45% damage buff while the next most effective, besides anti-armor because of it's varied results, is probably executioner and ads damage at 30% so I'd still say it's worth it, the real problem is the ammo economy right now as many calibers used mainly for automatics and energy weapons are far too scarce.
---
i bought it and love the unkempt look
---
I like Bethesda still, and I still have fun with this game, even if it’s not my favorite fallout game by far. I wouldn’t play strictly out of loyalty though, if it stopped being fun I’d stop playing regardless of my feelings towards them
---
Yes you can, I'm in the middle of doing that to my camp
---
No, but I’ve noticed the same thing. I didn’t realize the diseases might trigger something but it’s frustrating to have marsupial one minute and lose it the next. I’m also noticing this mess with my carry weight. 
---
Your stash should reflect you weight management perks i.e. batteries included , thru hiker , traveling pharmacy etc. the moment that stuff hits your stash it reverts to full weight it does not make sense at all!! 
---
You can farm fiber optics from turrets since they drop biometric scanners which break down into fiber optics. This is the only way I've found to effectively farm fiber optics because you can server hop to get turret respawns. If you farm microscopes the respawn timer on them is like a day. The best place I've found for turrets is at Harper's Ferry since it has 4 turrets, and as a bonus it occasionally spawns a couple of legendary's.
---
I also explore the world but an evening farming was always good fun, now it feels like a chore!
---
Because rare is the poster on here that doesn’t have some complaint.
---
Everyone is so busy bitching they don’t just enjoy the damn game ffs
---
Wait, so Jesus was banned?
---
How many caps for the night? And girls?
---
Rome burned done several times. Isn't that like calling your ship Titanic?
---
It doesn’t seem to matter.  At least not in any noticeable way.  I’ve been farming the shit out of events and the rewards suck no matter what level I roll with.  
---
Hooking your genitals to a car battery is more rewarding. 
---
It’s for this reason I’m kinda sad you can’t see character names. I can imagine a whole server full of Johnny Guitars. Like an Appalachian Gary clone
---
Thanks for posting, had a blast. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** w0lfn0ise! ^(hug)
---
only problem; the FO76 cover of Country Roads isn't on those.  :(  
---
That aside I do this too.
---
Yeah one of my characters uses a gatling plasma, with gunsmith and weapon artisan it still breaks so quickly, Bethesda have a lot to fix but if the game was more varied there may be less pressure on them.
---
I got Ants in My Pants every five
---
That's because you're actually making a burger. 
---
Its funny, I joined 4 nuke zones today where I was the only one in them from their starts. The people dropping the nukes dont even show up anymore.
---
You don't have rad worms, do you?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amjyyb/the_new_radworm_meta_is_not_fun_anymore/
---
Yeah I really don't get the logic behind it. If they focus on pvp, make it scale independently from pvm, seems so simple. Maybe monsters share the same id as players in pvp and they are too lazy to code otherwise? beats me.
---
what? i think u completely misinterpreted what I wrote there, im talking about priorities of other issues in relation to ones u submitted. coz im assuming ur submitting ur bug with a fix, that still doesnt mean they can or will implement said fix immediately, it'll be entered into their bug tracker, given a priority against all the other bugs, and this will determine when they will be able to fix it. Then when it comes time (which could even be a long time from the date of submission, if it is minor) for someone to look at it, they wont take your fix as is, someone will investigate, make sure its the most suitable way to fix said issue, and then implement a fix
---
While this is actually pretty mild (in my opinion) this is why we can't rename weapons that are visible to other players. 
---
True it's more of a fight on who has a better build.
---
100 - 0 ratio
---
You haven't? Well after level 50 you can choose between choosing a new card, or moving around one of your special points. 
---
I love that it’s not just a bare mattress lol. Vault tec 2 is my 2nd favorite which is the one you were thinking simple modern bed was I believe. 
---
Wait.. I thought they left Huntington out of the game? That's a real place!
---
