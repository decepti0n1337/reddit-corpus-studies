Really? Huh, I don't notice, but, that would explain a lot. I run a REALLY high Int build, as a side effect of being the groups crafter, and running an unyielding 20% health combat loadout. So, most of the time I have Int in the high 20s whenever I am fighting.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I am also a lot higher level compared to the other players in my team, but I thought it was because I spend my freed up time farming WestTek for equipment, which involved beating up a lot of high level supermutants.
---
---
---
I don't think "a couple" is meant quite that literally. I also think think you already know that.
---
Exactly ... it is better.  But its fine if you disagree, its not like either solution will be implemented, so I see no further point discussing the matter.

Here's a tip.

Get a refund during the refund window.

Otherwise suck it up. Your fault. No one else's.

You're a good wanderer friend, do you also spawn at the bottom of the cliff and have to fast travel again?
---
Hell, I've only killed 4 this far and I haven't seen a single legendary drop. Mostly it's just bones and once, a normal combat armor arm piece. 
---
The nerf is just the product of stupid people complaining about shit they don‚Äôt even have. I guarantee at least 90% of the complaints were from people who never found a TES weapon and wanted to ruin them for the rest of us out of spite
---
Everything.
---
Sad. Really it‚Äôs sad. 
---
Duping. Hard to tell whether an increased stash size negatively impacts several stability when you have people purposely straining servers so that they can carry around millions of pounds of loot on their characters. 
---
I want. Thanks!

But all cards are passive anyway.

wow, not sure whats funnier.  the F2P posts or this one.

Thankyou for doing this dude. Honestly it's great for those who cant check everyday for limited items.
---
I'm getting my Ass handed regularly at 35
---
Oh, me sad. 
---
I only pick up non legendary weapons and armor if I'm nearby a place I can scrap it all, but otherwise I'm a mess. I end up pruning it all out by bulk selling or dropping excessive amounts of shit.
---
Drops from the queen if you haven't run the prime nuke zone yet
---
Yes, unfortunately. If I fast travelled to the camp, it would put me on the bottom where stuff occasionally spawns. If I fast travelled to a friend at my camp it would straight up put me on the bridge below the cliff. 
---
i‚Äôve never even heard of a rail way gun.  color me curious!
---
Acid became my problem a few days after discovering Lucky hole mine.

Make them into nuka grenades!

really?  I find your PSA...when it was created 33 min ago

I have

I lost my 1st excavator PA and my black diamond

WS nuke zone
---
The best spot is a little unmarked lake just north of berkley springs there's a junk extractor there and frogs that respawn and give you infinite meat when you come back.
---
Next they‚Äôll nerf melee weapons I‚Äôm sure. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúfair‚Äù for people to be able to kill a scorchbeast in 3 hits once it lands. Damn snowflakes ruining everything
---
There are no "choices" or variety of ways to approach a problem. Not a single event/quest presents a choice to how want to deal with it. Then again he considers how to engage an enemy a "choice" so i guess all hope is lost on him anyway.
---
Carry weight is the biggest issue on this game to me. It absolutely sucks and the stash is way too small.
---
What system are you on?  If it‚Äôs PS4 I‚Äôll help you clear everything out.
---
we get it. you will ignore reality to keep bashing fo76.
---
Sbq gives me 3 star  **leather** arm like wtf

It's a Photomode pose.

It will do at rank 2, it reduces negatives by 75% so 4 -&gt; 1

You obviously didn't read the title or the content of my post. I never said to remove it completely. Learn to comprehend.

&gt; I have four alts packed with junk to make sure my main has some space ....

So you're telling me you've bought five copies of the game, and your wife also has a copy. 
---
***Congratulations!*** You are eligible for the Vault-Tech Frequent Customer Award!

~~It occurred to us at Vault-Tech that limiting your STASH capacity might encourage exactly this behavior, which is very profitable for our company.~~ Err, isn't it great that you can literally play with yourself in this game?
---
I think you know that couple is typically take for two. Couple means two people or to combine. 
---
But even then at 3 or 4 hours it‚Äôs still coming down to disconnects 6 to 8 minutes. He spent four hours getting disconnected every 8 minutes? 
---
Bethesda is usually not so shady? 
---
LUL
---
The article itself was really poorly written, the author was basically like EB games Australia has pulled FO76 off its shelves, no word on who made the actual call, just that it was not EB games so now I'm just gonna speculate on it being f2p. Like just EB games Australia didn't make the decision doesn't mean it came from Bethesda. It could've just been the franchisee or something bad about the batch delivered to one particular region. Also for people just now buying the game if they do their homework (and most people by now are going to do some research on the games to ensure it has improved since launch) they would know that there is almost no reason to buy a hard copy as 99% of the game needs to be downloaded
---
I'll be down to begin to the faction on Ps4, sounds like fun! (:
---
Ok sure
---
You‚Äôre a thoughtful intelligent person.
---
I was just saying this. It hurts my brain whenever I look at it. Much regret. 
---
I love it. Absolutely love BGS response.
---
I'd like to see one change made to power armor, and it would instantly shift the pa/non-pa balance. Marsupial shouldn't work in power armor.
---
Lol. Listen, I'm all for some good crossdressing, hairy guys in one-lady swimsuits, whatever right, but it would be nice if these things had female and male versions for the days I don't want to feel fabulous.
---
Thanks! I can‚Äôt recall the lvl. It‚Äôs that freakin perk that makes it dumb lol
---
Oh, okay -- I've seen (and killed) that guy a few times. I only ask because I saw someone nuking the dry lakebed outside of Charleston recently and couldn't figure out why. I thought maybe that's what they were talking about.
---
Also increase stash
---
Imma check it out for you right now cuh. 
---
I‚Äôve had it for awhile and never agro anything by accident. 
---
It definitely does. And west tek is great for XP, Ive noticed a lot more people there now that glowing ghouls dont give absurd amounts. But shhh, I dont need more people messing up my farming route :)
---
My character with 20 int gets 108xp for killing a lvl50 protectron in watoga. My 4 int char gets 74.
---
I first noticed something was tied to XP when I got hit with the -1 all stats disease. 
---
*Fairly* sure the location has nothing to do with it besides possibly the entire region's level cap. It's just "a power armor set" and will be otherwise random. Not to say it's a bad way to find some though.
---
It's the other bots that harass him. Phoenix doesn't start fights, he just finishes them.
---
The gear you want for pvp is Sentinels gear with the secondary afix of minus pvp damage.
---
Each piece gives minus 15% damage taken while not moving and minus 8% player damage. With a full set you really can't be killed at all. Plus you can then blow everyone way that gets close.
---
You didn't miss too much with tactics
---
Sure! 
---
You have a stellar wit. 
---
no..they start at 9 i believe..depending on the first person who was in that area on the server
---
I do the same. Utilize 76 in the same way. Someone also mentioned if you've got a workshop it can acts one as well, but I've yet to actually go down that garden path. 
---
It sounds like the resource drop from the enclave event (literally, the noise it makes), but I‚Äôve never seen it In that area, interesting 
---
Why are you even in power armor indoors
---
I had to teach my wife and friend how to make personal loot rules because their hoarding was out of control.
---
If you aren't running a PA build, you don't need fusion cores. (Just an example)
---
I don't loot legendaries unless I can use them right now or they are amazing and my build will use them later.
---
Stop running around with 37 different types of food. Say to yourself, "I'm only going to pick up glowing meat, or mole rat meat, or mongrel meat, and no other food source."
---
Blood packs and glowing blood are useless unless you spec bloodsucker. 
---
Super stims weigh a fuckload and are only meant to be used with auto stim mechanics like born survivor. If you dont use those, toss them.
---
Just think about ways to increase your loot discipline.
---
I do honestly think that the Scorchbeasts are occasionally bugged. 
---
Usually, they do the sonic attack, pause and fly around for a bit, maybe land for a while, do it all again, etc.
---
Sometimes, they just stay in one spot flying, REEEEEE, very brief pause, REEEEE, very brief pause, REEEEE...endlessly, basically until you kill them. Still not the issue.
---
I've seen them literally stuck in REEEE with no pausing, with so many graphical effects happening that my entire screen was shades of blue, no matter where I went, like, couldn't see my character or weapons at all. Couldn't aim, just ended up wildly shooting until by some miracle I killed the thing. 
---
&gt; You're having a very different issue from OP. 
---
No, we are both complaining about the same exact bug of rapid fire, difference is my character pretty much takes no damage.  Doesn't mean I am stupid enough to not tell when a scorchbeast is bugged like the other people ITT
---
That‚Äôs good to know, I may try better inventory but the third party storage for the perk swap one still gives me pause. I didn‚Äôt research it honestly, I just bailed out as soon as I read that on the nexus description but, at the very least, I‚Äôd imagine they **could** be saving up addresses and it **must** have some unique-to-you identifier... it just kind of skeeves me out. 
---
Stalking mothman
---
A Wendigo?
---
It's funny people are already calling Bethesda liars when the Quartering started the damn rumor and his sheep just ate it up.
---
So Bethesda bans players for exploits and duping and accessing places with 3rd party software and ftp rumors flew because one youtube video had a handful of reports of not even all copies of the game being removed and Bethesda is being called out for lying???
---
This really pisses me off with this outrage crowd.  They don't care about fact checking at all and go apeshit about stuff and they feel justified because 'their the consumer'.
---
What's the likelihood that the Quartering even plays the damn game beyond the first week?  Pretty much all the outrage crowd admit to not ever playing the game but just like to shit on it.
---
Obviously Bethesda made HUGE mistakes but when the critics are caught lying and spreading misinformation since even before the launch of the game how are these damn sheep so god damn gullible?
---
I'm just tired of this outrage garbage from people who don't actually give a damn about seeing a game improve from where it screwed up and just want to see everything they don't agree to like with us to simply crash and burn.
---
But I got a 10 year warranty on the install! Too bad the toll free number no longer works. :(
---
Aaaand I'm back into therapy again.  Thanks asshole.  
---
  
---
In all seriousness that game was just fucking awful.  And sadly it was one of my introductions into the fallout genre...gguess starting out at the bottem only ment I could go up
---
I can't relate, but I *can* empathize. 
---
I hope your needs and wants get the treatment they deserve!
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand how anxious it makes me. Lol. I have everything unlocked-  I‚Äôm level 165, level 15 INT, and of course weapon artisan, power patcher, Fox it good all of that; and I currently have 98 fusion cores on my person. 
---
I will never sell junk my man, if they up the stash space to 1,000 I will have 1,000 pounds of junk. If I know I can go a YEAR without having to worry about repairs - then I‚Äôll be good. 
---
The amount of junk I can have is limitless. 
---
Yeah if you own a workshop its free to travel to it.
---
Yeah I probably unsubbed around the time the trade glitch stuff started. Half of these were after and here too. Hence I still saw it all unfold each time.
---
The reason I say the nuka rum stuff is nonsense is because it's just a collector's item with a twist - it can be consumed. Basically a big nuka cola bottle case with the glass bottle of rum inside (Which I think is best- you get to keep the case after). Probably not the best rum either. It's just a piece of fallout merch. Like a plastic helmet.
---
Oh I remembered another one: the atom shop. Apparently it's all pay to win and we're "*being charged for things people already purchased in FO4*" (even spurred an article on a gaming website). The other day the circlejerk crew (gaming sub) had a post with pictures of New Vegas and DLC for like $10 and a picture of a power armour skin in 76 saying $20. Let's ignore how old FNV is and how horrifically buggy it even is now (but that's allowed because it was Obsidian); the post is a lie. The atom shop is free unless you choose otherwise. Despite having lights, weapon skins and other stuff from the store, at that moment I could have purchased that $20 skin twice over with the atom I had. That I got for free, just for playing the game.
---
Sorry for long reply. Really pisses me off!
---
Don't judge me bro. Not all of us walk around naked indoors. /s
---
I dunno but one time I came to the store and saw him getting dunked on by around 10 gutsys including a 3* legendary and I tagged the legendary and sat back and watched the fun.
---
Which is why a lot of us went back to Fallout 4
---
Is this a Yoda family reunion 
---
Your geting downvoted (not by me) because you have the nerve to say ANYTHING is wrong with this mess. It happens every time someone says anything critical of FO76. Its pretty nuts. But anyways yes, I agree. We need more space, and I cannot say it enough. 
---
Excavator PA had well over 300 carry with 1 str.
---
I wish they would have made the railroad stations free fast travel points or extremely cheap. The could have had Railroad robots running trains and repairing the rails to have it make sense ( Fallout Universe sense.
---
Thru Hiker perk drops the weight of food and drinks significantly. 
---
Another example of the fake info from your friendly neighborhood outrage crowd.
---
Thanks Quartering
---
Gnomes are probably behind your unexplained concrete. You shouldn't trust those gnomes.
---
There should be a boss Sloth... And if you got him with the vox syringer he yells "HEY YOU GUUUUUYYYYYYYYYYSSSSSS"
---
Not all of the underarmors are unequipped, just the ones that have their own gloves (such as the Enclave and BoS jumpsuits).
---
Oh so it's power armor or nothing?
---
Yeah, but with perks water weighs next-to-nothing and I‚Äôm not particularly concerned about diseases so 1 pound per is WAY too much for my liking. Good vendor trash I guess (I *think* you can sell it anyway).
---
I'd prefer an Instigating Protest Sign.
---
You can.

Where you on Xbox one and saw the mirelurk King near top of the world ? And u can tame sbalkygasters I had one before I had my mirelurk King

A lot of cards should really just be passives. 
---
Wait, he actually posted a video that wasn‚Äôt centered around crying and whining about SJW‚Äôs?
---
I have just started and its not gone below 550, not sure what im holding but its ridic
---
Sold already? 
---
Wow I can't believe there is a Reddit post of this rumor on front page. No one has bothered to google it and do some research.
---
You can also unlock the plan if you scrap it.
---
I've loved all other fallout games and really enjoy this one, they fixed game breaking bugs and seem to be keen to fix issues as they happen. 
---
  I think the problem is there should have been at least a month between beta and launch to fix problems, this caused it to come out broken and get massacred by the media. Once there is backlash like that it is hard to come back from. 
---
 On the other hand people forget that some of these issues are just common for online games, diablo 3 launch was a disaster and had its login error code become a meme, but no one remembers it now. Same thing happened with grand theft auto 5 online 
---
Never carry junk in your workshop. Stash it. 
---
Is this where I sign the petition to bring back the unlimited carry weight glitch?
---
https://imgflip.com/i/2rsm3n
---
I play fo76, but I am honest enough to say it's shit and that I welcome it going  f2p instead of just letting it die like this.
---
Working fridge is a shout
---
As much as I **loathe** perk-swapping, the ‚Äúrepairs require fewer resources‚Äù is your friend here. Without, I want to say most excavator repairs take ~8 black titanium and with they only require 1. Add in some (active) ‚Äúyour power/armor/weapons degrade more slowly‚Äù cards and repairs aren‚Äôt much of an issue. Except for springs. And screws. Damned if I ever feel like I have enough of those!
---
Not the solution you're looking for but try to exchange with other players? I've traded my unwanted ammo into 40,000 5.56 rounds.
---
If you're on PC and you need anything but 5.56 PM me for trade.
---
I been building weapons just to burn ammo I don't normally use. For low to middle level area they do just fine. It cut on grinding for ammo that you're perked for. 
---
The only reason you're saying this bs, is because you're that type, that steals the loot from a player you haven't even had the balls to attack, because you're too much of a chicken to take up the fight and get the loot the way it should've been. You don't want people to get a chance to get their loot back through a revenge, because you'll just die. And whats up with the 99% players not having an issue with this? I mean COME ON! - Ofcourse there should be a seek revenge option in this kind of situation. You're so wrong, "buddy". Acting so smart, while being such a p.... !
---
To be fair, wasteland women would be hairy too... Beauty in America comes from products and upkeep... Wasteland women would be looking some tribal hags on the nat geo channel lol... 
---
Nice shot!
---
Exactly, An online friends cousin  says that "90% of gamer's say that it sucks" I asked "where do you get that from?" then I chuckled... then he said "facebook" 
---
This is my favorite part too, people just popping and helping each other it feels right and works well. I'm a level 70 and I am constantly dumping extra stuff out in the flatlands church because I have to much, it's also a nice way to encourage the behavior 
---
Mason's great-great-great-great-great-geat grandfather 
---
That is a valid point.
---
Or maybe we can have an mmorpg that lets us have more than one build. That would be nice. 
---
Thanks!
---
My exact complaint too. I didn‚Äôt realize either that the person that found me at my camp, in the middle of nowhere, one shot killed me, was after the workshops I had. I do the same as you, I want the xp and loot. Then I didn‚Äôt realize every time I seemed revenge I was losing MY caps. Also, because I didn‚Äôt know the pvp was because of the workshops. I forget about them. I don‚Äôt care about them. Take them and leave me alone. I didn‚Äôt know he had taken one over. Then he proceeds to hang out at my camp. Use my benches. His friend in PA shows up. I just log off at that point because who knows what they‚Äôre about to do. 
---
Same, but I rarely have a disease.
---
I spend most of my time helping others. Its a good way to pass the time until we get alot more content to smash out. Not intrested in the up comming pvp content but the opening of the first vault dungeon sounda really fun hopefully it does not take too long to come out.
---
chainsaw is 2 handed. Slugger perks do increase it's dmg. There is nothing in the text of the Martial Artist perk that leads me to believe it should only apply to 1h weapons: "Your melee weapons weigh 20% less, and you can swing them 10% faster"
---
That said, buzzsaw weapons don't really "swing". You just hold them out in front of you and they do constant dps as long as you keep holding down the attack button.
---
Pretty sure dupers and cheaters are their priority now
---
A while ago I asked why they didn‚Äôt include this and someone responded saying they found plans for displays but they weren‚Äôt in the camp menu. Seems like they might have originally planned to add them but scrapped it for some reason
---
Those are very cool!
---
Or you buy another copy of the game and install it on another computer in your home or your laptop; swivel between the two keyboards &amp; screens running both toons.
---
again I ask:  do you know how much fo76 has pulled in/is generating for bethesda? if so care to share the number? 
---
As long as it is turning a profit it wont go ftp. this is the company that started dlc and with horse armor no less.
---
Well you see his statement about copies of F76 being pulled of the shelves and being sent back is actually true but you know..you don't care anyway.    It's quite hilarious how you complain about him being "patronizing as shit". Maybe you should indeed take a step back and look at your comment. Because you're patronizing right here in this comment of yours. 
---
Yeah you got me but to be fair you should offload your stuff before you go into a nuke zone so you can get more stuff to offload before you go into a nuke zone
---
I'd like to know too
---
LOL..yesterday i had to walk from Harpers Ferry to Watoga to Whitesprings because i needed to sell my items at different vendors and i was about 40 lbs over limit
---
&gt; People forget easily that we had to drag Bethesda kicking and screaming over the line on basic features like PoV sliders, DoF toggle and removing the fps cap.
---
Why is everyone so dramatic about this release?
---
There was some threads on reddit asking for things to be put into the game. The things were put into the game 2 weeks later. The turnaround on fixes has actually been very solid so far. I play on an ultrawide screen and it's serviceable. 
---
TBH the general PC keybindings is the real atrocity - whoever decided to have power hit and grenade on the same key needs a kick in the ass. After playing on Xbox, playing with KB+M is horrible.
---
Maybe. I would like to know why 3 scorchbeasts attack my camp near the whitespring. I only play on pacifist so idk. Maybe your camp is just near a spawn point for mothman
---
I do all that. 15 points in INT, All repair cards maxed out, etc. It‚Äôs just how I am, I worry about everything. The amount of junk I can have is limitless in my eyes. I need to know I‚Äôll NEVER worry about it. 
---
I don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt explain it, I know it‚Äôs not normal or ideal. 
---
I spend more time picking firecaps to make disease cures ......so I don‚Äôt have diseases for that long either and maybe that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt Had any accidental agro ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Whitesprings was fine you say? Damn, dunno whom (who?) to believe.
---
Wow that's amazing 
---
Looks so sinister 
---
i have all the crafting perks maxed, probably why i didn't notice.
---
thanks!
---
Yeah... pretty much FO76 in a nutshell lol
---
What platform? 
---
except their are a couple combinations of things in this game that make you almost unkillable. do some research before you go all white knight on people please. 
---
Also, does better inventory address the issue of incorrect weights showing for stash items when you have weight reduction perks? If so, I‚Äôll probably pull the trigger on that one, if not I‚Äôm still hovering around 50/50 on modding this game at all. 
---
I actually managed to finish this quest a while ago, when I was around level 15 to 30's (I'm level 65 now), I think. I was at 7/10 for the longest time and had given up on it. Then one day I was grinding at Whitespring (towards the back, where the fire station is) and I randomly got the notification that I completed the quest. My husband plays 76 on the computer, and had trouble with that one, too. 
---
I've killed a few since then, I didn't realize people were having so much trouble completing that one. I'll definitely try to avoid them since someone else around me might be trying to complete that quest.
---
I have not learned all those mods.  Oddly enough I get more 1\* legendary lever actions that I won't use more than regular ones so it's taken a while to get any.
---
With green thumb and chemist plus super dupper I can replenish my disease cure supply pretty fast.
---
I can do ps4
---
Nooooo your fine fine. 
---
But I just remembered I left my CAMP on fire...
---
I got mine early in the game before people started farming whotesprings
---
I can do it if you meet me in flatwood
---
There's nothing more immersive than swapping out cards in the middle of a fight. 
---
Nice pic! 
---
Dude snuck up on me yesterday and i accidentally clobbered him. That means I have now killed everything except the flatwoods monster which I haven't even seen.
---
Unfortunately, no. The only way you learn mods is to break stuff down (or find the plans), yes, but it's random what you learn from each breakdown. You can sometimes find mods at vendors, too, under the Mods category, but they're one-use items.
---
Yeah you can join! Just a heads up tho there will be some crass/adult language in the discord (cowboys lol) 
---
I read the entire content of your post, and you want PVP disabled until it's deemed "acceptable" by your standards...
---
You want every fight to be on equal footing -- which it never can or will be.
---
Because you've only had negative experiences, you think those equate to everyone else's. Pretty pathetic, really.
---
"I never said to remove it completely. "
---
So I'm the one having comprehension issues? Having something taken completely out does not make it permanent.
---
Seriously though, do you \*honestly\* believe removing a system from the game because it isn't 100% balanced is a solution? I'm seriously asking.
---
Then they shouldn't have done it that way. Using hexadecimal they could simply program an extra few characters into the ID of the item to denote its condition. How many possible combos are there? This is dumb and the fact that they hacked this shit together from existing code doesn't make it any better. They could also have some beefy DB servers handling this shit and the game server instances just making calls to the DB server so that DB issues dont crash the fucking game like a poorly coded web app. The limits are way too low and whoever signed off on this shit knew damn well that it would be a problem. 
---
Nope, it will just randomly unlock something, probably the thing you want the least.
---
Next one's at the end of the month and we just jad a fairly sizeable patch?
---
Just ran through west tek, picked up 300+ steel from the guns lol.  I swear though, those damn mutants just pile up on you inside.  Good thing I use plasma grenades in excess...
---
On my mobile, but someone recently posted a CPU affinity assignment, it's not completely resolved my issues (only since last patch) but it helped a great deal,
---
Might be worth a search or two 
---
It definitely will go free to play, it's just a matter of when.
---
They really really just need to let us set some colors on the armor so people can make squad colors and tell who‚Äôs who, right now it‚Äôs just always black. 
---
This is not an option for non pa builds or pvpers
---
They really got the blast zones down pat. So cool to look at and go into
---
I think it would be better to only allow friends to use other friends camps as fast travel targets. That could help with randoms that just attack random camps 
---
Do people really believe Bethesda these days?
---
Acid is a must have for anyone that makes projectile ammunition. Acid and cloth make gunpowder which is needed for black powder weapons and for making ammunition in general. It is also used for making some explosives. I am always running short of it, but I also have an aluminum mine that I have to use acid to make the ore into scraps. 
---
Check it out soon, Will you make a ps4 community for well ps4 players?
---
Has he teleported right in front of you before after you spot him? Made me shit my pants. 
---
Also, try the top right of the map in the mire around midnight, game time. I've had plenty of luck with the flatwood monsters there. Even killed a few.
---
I don't think White Knight is one of those perks tho...
---
Wade airport. Not only will it fuel your gunpowder and steel reserves from the mutants, but there are a bunch of coolant, antifreeze and countless meat bags full of bug parts for acid. I usually net 100-130ish per run there. Also the fireflies from the lighthouse event can yield a lot of acid from their abdomens.
---
I prefer to run round Watoga triggering the bot spawns. I find I have much more luck then Whitesprings when it comes to getting good legendary drops (not so much for xp tho). You also don't have to deal with the greedy TSE idiots either.
---
It depends. If he is low lvl and the watoga bots are high he runs and hide like a coward. 
---
Unstable isotope has a visual, also with the electrified one. Not sure if you meant permanent disfigurement though
---
I get you. I‚Äôm totally the same way in any single player game with unlimited stash but I‚Äôve been forcing myself to just let it go. I have a short list of things I‚Äôll NEVER drop/sell and everything else: you‚Äôll always find more. I completely understand it‚Äôs nerve-wracking though! And, for the record, I‚Äôd like a much bigger stash limit too! 
---
Yes we will have a team leads 
---
I need to clarify that I'm not the OP pf this thread and it seems like you're replying thinking I am. 
---
&gt;&gt; Not everyone got it, Bethesda made it opt in. The fact that it happened was just another incident in a long series of fuck ups.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;So... what relevancy does this have? Anyone and everyone has the opportunity.
---
It needed to be said because you wrote "no one ever mentions the people who bought it are going to end up with two bags and got free in-game credits." That's not a universal truth - they were given the chance to opt in for that, which is not the same thing. Bethesda *could have* shipped to all customers of that edition but chose to make them opt in, knowing that the cheapest way to do it since you're not going to get 100% response rate. It's just cost saving but there's a difference between what you said and what they did.
---
&gt;Your goal here is to continuously list off anything that's happened that's less than perfect... for the purpose of... getting people to dislike the game? Months after release?
---
&gt;What does your argument, your point here, really boil down to?
---
&gt;Just a die-hard attempt to refute anything I say?
---
Nah, I was just sticking up for the guy you went on a rant at. Innacurate facts are inaccurate facts - you're a reviewer and should know better than to use them.
---
&gt;How long is an acceptable update and fix schedule to you then?
---
Beta was over a period of 4 weeks and started in the middle of October. The xp glitch didn't get fixed until 2 weeks after launch. It was a known glitch in the beta. It seems like the duping glitch is taken care of but idk - that was fixed on January 1st. I didn't hear about that one until a bit after launch though.
---
In any case, you've got 2 game breaking glitches whose methods were *extremely* well publicized and they aren't fixed for 1.5 months and  2.5 months after launch (2.5 and 3.5 months after release of the beta). 
---
&gt;I'd say 4 updates in a month is a pretty fast turnaround myself. Never have I see faster updates than that, especially considering the size of the updates, and the quick development of community requested features.
---
That is fast. To the dev teams credit, they're busting their ass to fix the game. 
---
&gt;&gt;When a bird shits on a new car once, people are still wowed by it. Not so much when the car is so covered in bird shit that you can barely see out the windshield.
---
&gt;The only thing that shitty around here are the people painting the game like that, when it couldn't be further from the truth.
---
The point is that the accumulation of small/large problems, glitches, and hiccups are what paints the game that way. Spin it how you want, I guess. 
---
&gt;So really, lets go to it: Why do you have such a raging hard-on for hating on this game months after release?
---
&gt;And... doesn't the very existence of this conversation and how insistent you are to list off all of the problems, big and small, proof of my original point that started all this conversation?
---
&gt;You're clearly obsessed with the game.
---
Again, that was my first post in this sub in ~3 weeks. 
---
&gt;My eyes were opened after hearing about it. I knew Fallout 76 was plagued with a serious problem once I heard back from people. **I continued**   
---
   
---
&gt;Very few have even attempted to consider what I have said. 
---
Have you actually consider what you have said yourself? Because I don't think you have. You knew that duping existed and your items were likely duped, yet continued to trade duped items after you learned about it? You couldve stopped right there, but you continued. You deserved to be banned after that.
---
I mean i would if i cared
---
Hi just a friendly reminder that fallout is set after a resource war. Maybe ask mad max, rick grimes or any other apocalypse survivors what they thought was a chore.
---
Also. If you're overweight, you can loose many lb's by not carrying so much junk, (or weapons). Ask Jenny Craig how Quality weapons over Quantity can revolutionise your confidence in the wasteland !
---
same for me, scorched all over the place and after nuking.... nothing
---
Try doing the Queen of the Hunt daily. I‚Äôve done it twice and killed a Grafton Monster, 2nd killed a Flatwoods Monster.
---
If it's over 1k don't buy it. 
---
Nice hit me up and I can check it out
---
I hear you on many of these points and I mostly agree.
---
People destroy camps because it‚Äôs fun to do so and I‚Äôm pretty sure the biggest portion of that fun comes from the reaction of the camp owner. I personally haven‚Äôt done it, but I have done a bit of workshop attacking for fun and profit once one of my victims followed me to my camp afterward and fat manned it to hell. 
---
That was actually fun. I was making chems and the world exploded in fire and my walls and workbenches were gone (despite the menu not going away automatically). It didn‚Äôt kill me since I wasn‚Äôt flagged at the time so it made the attacker wanted and I got to kill him again. But he got the satisfaction of fucking my shit up and honestly I felt like it was fair. I make my camps almost purely functional though so I‚Äôm sure someone who‚Äôs a Fallout architect would care more.
---
Ultimately I understand the frustration, but in the end it‚Äôs within the system that Bethesda built. While it‚Äôs nice to think people will somehow act differently the only way to stop this from happening is get Bethesda to change the system. I get where you‚Äôre coming from but people are going to do what they can and right now blowing up someone camp has fairly low consequences.
---
It seems clear that some players want a truly pacifist server. Who knows when and if Bethesda will offer that.
---
I'm with you there. I have 70 of the cola, cherry, and quantum.
---
Just found out there's a nuka purple at the whitesprings soda shop that removes rads. I was like whaaaa? 
---
Some place to hit up after emptying the caps from all the vendors with stuff still to sell.
---
They need to make a tab to switch builds on the fly do you can switch from utility to combat with one button. Full card respec but not full special. 
---
Need me to make something for you?
---
But they shouldn't be. Cosmetics should not add bonuses much less subtract bonuses like kicking off your armor...
---
That's where mine is too.  I don't understand why everyone keeps responding to me lol.  I just asked the question because he said he could be as low as 400.
---
From what I've heard, this is related to the bug that shows friends as offline, even if your playing together.
---
Easy to check on Console if it's a glitch or a hack (Console Friends List), not so sure about PC though.
---
Still, better safe than sorry, I suppose.
---
No, this is not what I mean. You "ask to join" from the map when the other player is not in the proximity.
---
Sell it on Let Go
---
Cramburger is listed as unobtainable, but it can be found. In Grafton, on a road (cant remember exactly where) with an APC and some ballot printers. 
---
Right there with you...  
---
Majority of the time I can't fast travel and love if
---
Copies being pulled does NOT equal a F2P rumor. Holy shit. All that sounds like is ignorance to how game distribution *works*. His statement is basically him letting everyone know he got a personal "call" from Bethesda to explain. That doesn't sound like journalism as much as *damage control*. There's nothing to brag on or feel validated on there.
---
Keep it coming.
---
I'd do 800 
---
MODUS the cambden park guy, the beastmaster, grafton mayor the dude at Morgantown and that's the ones I can name off the top of my head
---
I would believe that it was vanilla if he told me but he specifically avoided sharing any evidence that he wasn't exploiting but thank for the hot take friendo
---
I mean don't get me wrong, but isn't that supposed to be part of it? You have to make choices about what whether you should grab something or wait and see what else you might find? 
---
I was just minding my own business and BAM! he was right there, I hit the trigger and smashed him.
---
Beauty
---
 That's where mine is too. I don't understand why everyone keeps responding to me lol. I just asked the question because he said he could be as low as 400. 
---
I checked his comments it seems hes PC
---
Ha. I always imagine it to be taking a bite and chucking the rest for food and taking a sip and throwing out the rest for drink.
---
Phew. I'm glad we can confirm that it's not going free to play, but rather it's just a terrible game that game stores can't sell. lul
---
Yeah but when you have 2 scorchbeasts circling around spamming their sonic attack, shaking the screen and obscuring your vision you might just miss those other queues...
---
Also, 
---
I when exiting a workbench on Xbox you hit B then A. The game then exits the workbench and re-enters the work bench. You have to do it twice in order to get out of any work bench. Then sometimes it‚Äôll just go to the display of you doing something and you become stuck there.
---
In addition I'd like to see how many of what kind of junk I have in stashbox and on me. I'm always out of aluminum at this level...not sure why... but man its be nice to know when I have enough for the next repair...I like to roam explore, and sometimes it gets heavy and decisions to drop junk has to be made...knowing how many of one kind would help make that choice easier.
---
Have you found the place where you can catapult skeletons out of a cliff?
---
Because we did, and then we wanted to recreate that experiment and learned how to propel ourselves nicely into air. Fun.
---
he probably downloaded some sort of keylogger or uses the same password for all of his accounts. People CANNOT get someone elses password without the user of said password allowing a program or a person access to their information. whether it be known or unknown. Especially if said person downloads mods for other games or anything like that, downloads music or movies. There are hundreds of ways to involve yourself with phishing or keylogging.
---
Please tell me you're going to add some sort of Perk card loadout custom slot, type system thingy. Plleeeaaaassseeeeee.... pretty please with sugar on top, Bethesda. I swear I'll stop calling you guys greedy cunts. 
---
Are you using class freak? That's the perk that reduces negative effects of mutations. Starched genes just prevents them from being removed 
---
Abandoned Bog Town Workshop. 
---
There's stairs that lead to the top of a building. If you enter from the top, you will find around 7 Typewriters, phones, 3 antique globes, and various junk in the filing cabinets. 1 floor below that there's somewhere around 10 bags of cement. 1 is on a table. 1 is above the table, 1 is below, and there's about 7 in a pile by an entrance. 
---
The workshop also has 3 concrete extractors.
---
That is a horrible location as it blocks the spawning of the random responder vendor bot that sells the hunters long coat and the clean space suit. 
---
It would make a lot more sense if the PA would actually be "hung" or otherwise attached to the power armor work stand. Could be used for display and also would let you just leave it there instead of having it revert to inventory after 30 seconds or whatever.
---
How do you trigger bot spawns? I just run passed the machines and some spawn more, most don‚Äôt though 
---
üòç need more players like you
---
Oh, on xbox...no mods available 
---
I got that a lot, but not any more. Not sure if that was fixed in the latest update for me... if i run into it again I'll say so.
---
Carry less stuff. Problem solved. 
---
Looks like that actually worked for me, at least for now. Before I couldn't play 5 min straight without crashing. After scraping my PA helmet with hud targeting mod on it I didn't see a blue screen not once. 
---
I got held up by a couple guys claiming to be raiders.  They were a much higher level than me.  They said if I paid them a tribute then I would be allowed to leave.  I left them some mentats and high-tailed it out of there. Was hilarious. 
---
He wrote T.O.W.N.S. because it is easier than M.U.N.I.C.I.P.A.L.I.T.I.E.S.
---
Two shot bonus damage is being reduced from +100% to +25% and explosive is being reduced from +100% to +20%
---
You didn't mention if you're playing in Windowed or actual Fullscreen. Have you tried fullscreen? 
---
What's wrong with Yongyea? I mean, yeah he's been critical of Bethesda recently a lot recently - but was a big Bethesda fan and Bethesda has earned that scrutiny recently. He also treats Activision and EA in much harsher lights as deserved.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll clear or for you to get the sword. I remember trying to do this and getting destroyed 
---
If you are on Xbox and have a second console you can share your Xbox love gold subscription and any games for free to get more storage. I have tested this and it works, but you need two xboxes lol. 
---
you don‚Äôt place your camp right in front of the station, you go across the street where the lake is and place it somewhere around the lake
---
Xbox one... 
---
I‚Äôm not able for modify my vault 76 jumpsuit with treated lining for.... some reason?  
---
No perks seem to be required, and it calls for 2 ballistic fiber and 6 gold.   
---
I have 18 BF and 7 gold, but the mod is grayed out and says I lack the materials to create this item.  
---
Why??
---
Aw damn, still better than basic at least 
---
There are actually several Fonline servers still running, though some have lost a lot of players, especially recently, because of stagnation of development and no wipes (I'm looking at you, Wesan).
---
Fonline: Reloaded - https://www.fonline-reloaded.net
---
Fonline 2 - https://fonline2.com/en/
---
Fonline: Requiem - http://www.fallout-requiem.ru/index.php/en/
---
There's also plenty of other servers still in development like Ashes of Phoenix and the original author of the Fonline Engine is still working on his own game, The Last Frontier (https://lastfrontier.ru) which is pretty similar in concept to other Fonline games but with its own original setting and lore.
---
Also I've worked on Fonline: Aftertimes two months ago but I've had to quit as things went to shit as the main programmer had no idea what he was doing which resulted in the current state of the server to be pretty much dead at this point.
---
Don't think things will get any better from this point on in Fonline community unless AOP or The Last Frontier will finally be released (and be good too). Though it was fun while it lasted.
---
Seems more like he was banned. Tell him to check his spam folder, there should be a message from bethesda.
---
Okay. I have just seen too many camps built right next to the shack.
---
Yeah, I was forced to switch servers just because the map wasn't giving me any respawn points. The while thing is really frustrating.

"It just works" and definite $60 price tag.
---
well with your attitude I wouldn't want to share any info about my build either. he probably thought you where trying to figure out a way to kill him.
---
I cant find one, I only found a red dress. I look shrexy..
---
if you're on PC, I'd be glad to build you a fusion generator, but it's a bit longer than 1 floor square. And when you move, you wouldn't be able to put it back down. :-(  
---
You get the fusion generator plans from doing the "Powering Up" events at Poseidon, Monongah, etc. I did it 4 times the other night on my level 14-15 character before I got them all (1 extra so a friend could get it, too.)
---
I'm talking about the junk you drop when you die. My stash is full.
---
You're a cunt. Stop playong this and play call of duty, you fucking twit. Lol
---
Haha I feel you, sometimes people go a little wild with their camps
---
Because he's vengeful!
---
Honestly, I stopped playing the game because of this. Biggest problem period.
---
Lololol this fucking loser
---
you dont know? everyone on the internet starts with it if they decided to put initial points in ego and epeen.
---
I leaned out what i could. And even tried just walking around since i could not get under weight, gave up and have quit until they raise this more
---
Reading this made me remember i got the perk that increases explosion radius
---
Me too! IGN = LillyVee
---
I'm a loner most of the time, but sometimes some company would be very nice! :)
---
That is truly epic, you have my upvote. Which platform?
---
Wait. Nuka-Grape is in the game? I've only ever found Reg, Cherry and the 40+ Quantums I've been collecting.
---
Once owned, it can be on all my hunting rifles...right?
---
I REALLY like the idea of being able to have a ghost slot to put carry weight perks into. 
---
I have had this same thought. 
---
The game is completely unbalanced right now, and as a result, so is PvP. It's extremely unfun and not worth anyone's time. 
---
It would make sense for them to disable PvP temporarily until they balance stats more. 
---
If you've never played an mmo or let say the diablo series where you have set carry limit. I don't know what to tell you. People are just being entitled to shit these days. Get a grip bring less aid with you. Just  pack on corn soup.
---
That would also be wrong.  Both "assumption" and "presumption" mean that I said it was true.  I never said it was true I said "if".  
---
For example if I said "If you were a smart person, you would understand the difference between a conditional and an absolute statement, you would might be a smart person".  That does not mean that I am saying you are a smart person.  I'm just saying it is a possibility. 
---
If it had a preview of the blueprint when you hover over it that'll be nice, or even the power armor like you said, it should be that when you hover over that as well it displays on the right what is equipped to it.
---
There are multiple character slots btw
---
Thanks! 
---
PC
---
You need that Bandolier perk (STR). helps with ammo weight management. 
---
Ive found 3 stills in the game. You cant use em, but they are there
---
Ah ok thanks 
---
I'm wondering this too
---
So what you're saying is waste two points to increase carry weight.... Mhm sounds like exactly what we all are trying to avoid. 
---
Run up to it and wait a second in front of it. Most times it spawns a bot. I assume it's tied to how many are already in the area so every now and then I go on a killing spree.
---
I've had no luck with Whitesprings lately. Even 3 star enemies don't drop anything good. Today in Watoga tho I picked up a Tesla with bloodied explosive and 90% reduced weight haha.
---
Rage 2 is a couple of months away maybe that specific retailer just told the distributors to take it back or forget any floor space for Rage 2.
---
I mean eso never did.
---
You're the type who just reads the headline and reacts with outrage without actually reading the article, aren't you?
---
You should look more deeply into things. He's kind of a dick, but he didn't bully her for two years the way she and various extreme-SJW sites like GameRevolution (blech) claimed.
---
What he _did_ do was to make _one_ video and _two_ tweets, and what he said may have been uncomfortably or even painfully true, but it didn't rise anywhere near the level of bullying.
---
Stop letting people take a little rubber hammer to your knee every time you log on to the internet. It's not good for you and it's not good for the rest of us.
---
I don't want to go all through the comments to see if this has already been mentioned, but I have my own track for BF which pretty much matches what you have except I just go through CB since I only have to repair a piece maybe once every two days.  If you've ever done the enclave mission in Watoga where you have to repair the transmission thingies you've probably gone up the fire escape of the red building and then crossed over to the other building via the catwalk where you have to jump up on top of the blue structure for one of the repair locations.  Rather than going across the catwalk if you stay on top of the first building and go to the helicopter on top there (not the one by the SB nest) there's a dead soldier on the ground who has a ammo bag beside him.
---
The last thing I see sometimes, as my eyes roll into the back of my head, is my character running towards God knows where and staring straight up at the sky. Sometimes I scare the crap out of myself bc my muscle memory makes me shoot whatever gun I'm holding. I often wonder if I'm seen doing this out there...
---
I'm mostly enjoying my time with it. Only ended up playing it because I got an amazing deal on an one x and this game came with it. Wouldn't have purchased this game for more than 20.
---
you mean hit something alive? 
---
I only tried with melee death tambo
---
I'm sorry, I forgot the post apocalyptic sci-fi game with super mutants and giant bugs was supposed to be realistic.
---
You might want to lay off the Psycho. 
---
How spacious and elegant!
---
Travel Agent can help reduce the hurt on you.
---
It takes away average for me 2-3 caps.
---
Can take up to 12 off.
---
Lol it‚Äôs a mutation , check status , it‚Äôs healing factor you regen out of combat fast but chem effects are halved 
---
Played every game in this franchise on PC, just started playing this one on XBox; haven't had a lot of screentime yet (level 7 or some such) due to schedule/family, but most of my time thus far has been spent roaming around, encumbered, desperately seeking a bench to scrap junk, after which I'm still encumbered. Super enjoyable... -_- I miss playing on PC where I could use the console to turn that garbage off.
---
You probably have healing factor mutation, which Radaway will cure. 
---
We really need a two factor authentication.
---
Re-posted from another thread:
---
This really pisses me off with this outrage crowd. They don't care about fact checking at all and go apeshit about stuff and they feel justified because 'their the consumer'.
---
What's the likelihood that the Quartering even plays the damn game beyond the first week? Pretty much all the outrage crowd admit to not ever playing the game but just like to shit on it.
---
I got them, thanks!
---
Broken weapons even stay on the hotkey technically, because if you try to switch to it you get a prompt saying you cannot use it until it's repaired. If it was removed from the hotkey unpon breaking, hitting that hotkey would just produce fists. I have not seen this to be the case. What I see as weird in your case is that you didn't disconnect. Most reports I've read of vanishing items come after a random disconnect, with the item being missing after logging back in. Either way, there's no place to even "start" to look. I know my rifle was not broken when it disappeared, as I was using it when I disconnected. 
---
Check and see if you caught the mutation ‚Äòhealing factor‚Äô because that‚Äôs exactly what it does. 
---
Was it at night? Supposedly we have health regen at night until the 8th i think
---
Would love a ldtr on that. From the view I see it she got triggered from his opinion and sent her white knights.
---
ABSO-FCKN-LOOTLY!!! HERE HERE!!! Don't change a damn thing about these beautifully deadly beasts!! 
---
Not disagreeing here but I'm more in favour of Bethesda changing the whole perk system so that every 5 or 10 levels you unlock a passive perk slot where you can only put the crafting/carry weight/fast travel etc. cards into.
---
The whole perk loadout swapping around whenever you do something special is tedious and boring. 
---
See ya there!
---
you can tell if it will go under your armor if it weighs 1.10 if it weighs 0.10 it will go overtop of your equipped armor.
---
This is an online only game that requires a continuous revenue stream to operate.
---
Are you going to claim your huge friends list is brimming with people with an online status? And you and your friends are tossing 20 dollar bills at your screen, desperately clicking Buy Now on all the amazing stuff on the atom shop?
---
No, the future of this game has always been to sell to us diehard fallout fans and then switch to f2p with lunchboxes.
---
Look at the threads from people who just recently got this game heavily discounted, and are baffled that they can't even display items or have different storage containers. This game needs heavy development and that ain't gonna be cheap.
---
The actual obtainable recipe note is called "Delbert's Bunless Cramburger". The unobtainable one is probably a dummied out version of the same recipe, before it was re-attributed.
---
I wanted to like ‚Äúlast laugh‚Äù but the first time it happened the explosion tossed my body aside and I was never able to find my paper bag :( 
---
This.
---
There's currently an event where you get passive health Regen at night 
---
Check the main menu
---
Didnt he get banned from gencon after he himself was the one assaulted? I get you dislike the guy and thats completely fair but lets not spread misinformation about ppl intentionally.
---
--closed
---
Doesn't like their opinion = white supremacist?
---
No wonder these words are losing their value.
---
People like you are (attempting) to ruin this game. You are likely a casual who has no idea about what certain legendary armors can do in this game. I suggest you do some research before you post. That's coming from a confirmed asshole. 
---
Why cant we just have a general unsecure storage box for our camp, that way we can keep usefull stuff in there that team members can access? And just keep stuff we dont want messed with in our stash ???
---
I'll offer to make them a weapon of their choice and a set of level 5 leather armor if they want. I'm mostly melee and tend to drop ammo to save weight, but I'll give them a couple hundreds rounds if I have it.
---
Beyond that, I don't offer much else, but I'll take them on a little field trip through the forest and show them where they can grab everything they need to make a bunch of healing salve and glowing fungus soup.
---
When I can I just drop a few things to get them along. Maybe 5-10 stimpacks, a few purified waters, a few unneeded plans.  I don‚Äôt go overboard.  
---
Of course, the average new player runs off before I can ‚Äúshow‚Äù them the dropped brown bag.  I don‚Äôt engage in trading and rarely have my headset on. 
---
I believe their first response to several of these was "it is technically impossible" and then a few weeks later it suddenly became possible.
---
I'm also still waiting on that text chat, the exclusion of Wichita is totally unheard of.
---
I feel like it's more of a joke than anything. If the only reason you're playing the game is to get the hours played achievement, you should probably play a different game. 
---
RIP just dashboard 
---
Bethesda today said there is no truth to that rumor. 
---
i just periodically empty all junk out of my stash and scrap it to save space. Although I really would like to use some of those beer steins in Helvetia for decorations. 
---
Honestly had to reread and look at what level you are. I hate to spoil dialogue from the overseer but the point of vault 76 is the best and brightest leaving the vault, and working together to rebuild America. The holotapes you will find kind of tell that story. That‚Äôs why the other factions(BOS e.t.) didn‚Äôt make it. 
---
Completely fine with me I haven't had a single crash. i rarely had any before the update either.
---
I get it, and I like it.

I think the cap on ammo weight is -90% so if you use the perks it negates the armors effect. Even if you have 5 pieces or armor with -20% ammo weight it won‚Äôt be the full 100% it will cap at 90%

by channels you mean like a server? if so yes i own a server here is the link:[https://discord.gg/FeSXca3](https://discord.gg/FeSXca3)

I've set up my (probably) permanent C.A.M.P. in a scenic spot that more or less mirrors Vault 76's location on the East side of the map so that between the two I can get the cheapest travel prices on either side of the Divide.
---
This is probably THE *nicest* game I've ever played. I can count on one hand the amount of assholes I've come across. It's three. They weren't even *that* bad. At least not bad enough for me to give a shit about an hour later. One blew my C.A.M.P. up after they claimed my 10 cap bounty. Another one aimed their weapon at my friend while they were at the vendor and the final one tried to gatling gun me when I spawned in their C.A.M.P. area which was the same as mine. In the moment it was like, "Really???" But that quickly passed. It's really nice. I'm glad you're having the same ecperience!
---
its great..i love it..traversing thru appalachia is like a breath of fresh air..the survival aspect is very realistic..even tho my damn player is hungry and thirst every second of the day..i love the mutations..and the different weapons..i definitely consider myself a sandbox player..i never care to beat games..i like to play and immerse myself in the environment..also this is my first online game and interacting with other players have been great..the past few months flew by since i am having so much..all other games have been put on hold for now
---
Nah. Logging on now. Name is VoriidNightbane
---
This is amazing and useful.  Wow!
---
Just as I thought but didn't want to hear. Thanks for the info. I'm on Xbox unfortunately, thanks for offering though! 
---
Hi friend,
---
I have done some research. This encounter was definitely exploiting and I say that based on what I saw, the messages I received from the player, and the research I did because it seemed sketchy. 
---
I understand that the right combination of legendaries is pretty powerful. This guy was 30 levels lower than me and sending cagey messages about how he's definitely not exploiting even though I didn't bring it up until he did. 
---
Enjoy your day. 
---
I'm gonna try some different things tonight. I'll make sure to post if I figure anything out
---
I mean it was kind of obvious. It's just haters trying to devalue the game.
---
Reminds me of when I worked retail. Sometimes customers would love asking if we were going out of business for stupid reasons, but they have no idea of the big picture and how much our store actually made.
---
Where did you find enough marine armor to scrap? Is there a good place to farm/find it?
---
Honestly is. I refused to use any rad away or risk losing that mutation at all. Shout out to that random stranger that gave me the mutation to start with
---
Except it's not a lie. Copies being pulled of the shelves is actually happening. And nowhere did he say that F2P is confirmed becauce of it. You're actually lying more then he is. But hey i guess Bethesda had a lot of damage control practice with F76. And considering their "damage control" amounts to "There is no truth to this rumor." it seems they're still bad at it. 
---
Sorry but carry wieght does effect combat.  Lockpicking hacking trader traveling base building and maybe the perks that strictly effect crafting weapons or armor with no in combat effect.  Everything else has an effect on combat.  Carry weight lets you being more weapons to be more versatile.  Most of the weapon and armor crafting perks reduce the cnd failure rate.  
---
The Nuka-Girl rocketsuit is an outfit, but it replaces underarmors that have gloves attached (such as the orange or black BoS "Soldier", "Knight", and "Officer" suits or the Enclave suits), likely because of how the engine normally treats conflicting equipment slots (in this case, the gloves).
---
The over-armor outfit slot is new to 76 and the Nuka-Girl outfit specifically has been the target of a previous bug fix that now correctly allows most armor and underarmor items to be worn underneath. The remaining underarmors not affected are probably an oversight due to taking up additional equipment slots, and not the intended behavior.
---
I find the vendor bot Responder all the time
---
i killed a flatwoods monster in whitesprings golf course.. think it was during nuke but not sure
---
I had a thought of increasing perk limit to 76. Gives you 26 total perks to be passive. Can't max out every branch though. Plus it goes with the theme. It would also be nice to trade/exchange unused perk cards for ones you want to use, which I believe has been mentioned before. 
---
Today we lost a bunch of Good hard working Nuggets.
---
Lets take a moment of silence for our fallen soliders.
---
RIP - Nuggets boys ;)
---
But bad man said mean thingie that I disagree with so I musta stop my hobbies cuz bad man bad /s
---
Thanks for the reply. That's what I was thinking but I was really hoping otherwise. Vender hopping here I come... 
---
Yes
---
Thank. God
---
I like this. 
---
Place is full of virgin white knights, what else did you expect?
---
That's the easy one. Just run across the red bridge and back to spawn her or random mobs.
---
I haven't see Grahm in over a month. 
---
A mans gotta eat...
---
Get, I never see it and I was looking hard this weekend!
---
Cool idea. Would make it a whole lot more immersive than putting Travel Agent on.
---
Fastest Google in the west
---
Protip: stop playing this garbage game.
---
I happened to run into Grahm once, earlier this month.  I don't see him much.
---
We run SBQ's every night on my stream and a bunch of people come and hang out in my house while myself or one of my team runs the silo.  People trade items, protect the base from stray scorched, and help each other with mods and what not. It's actually pretty cool and we rarely get griefers or asshats.  You are welcome to join us, just add me: coldnorthmenace 
---
This invitation is open to anyone reading this.
---
The games dead boo
---
No this is Nintendo contra god mode. 
---
Cool! I haven't seen the cloud from that distance before.
---
Love the idea. Maybe even make it a wide spread event and people have to clear the tracks at various locations.
---
He‚Äôs really annoying, he stirs controversy. 
---
What is the title of his video? What is the question that he's raising for 11 minutes (to make you sit and get him money by the way)?
---
You seem awfully defensive about obvious cognitive dissonance here. Why be a rabid fan of someone like that?
---
Correction: retro-futuristic genre*
---
And yes, its a game about leaving a vault with just about nothing and surviving in a nuked wasteland.
---
Im glad that your party, (team we want unlimited things for free), is a minority.
---
It is not free to play.
---
You can mod on fallout 4. I'm not sure why they dont add this option for 76
---
It's not free to play and it's on the Bethesda launcher.
---
Yup. I have 2 friends that haven't played since BETA that always show online but it's really someone else. Usually corrects itself after a few mins. But it happens all the time.
---
yep, and the rewards are crap.
---
For me it‚Äôs the Grafton protesters. They‚Äôve spawned exactly once, with two minites to go. Still failed. I‚Äôve been up there with friends who can do it every time, and when I‚Äôm with them it fails. Another friend has to re-share a perk every time we fast travel or spawn. Some accounts just seem to have permanent bugs.
---
Google seems to think otherwise. I cant imagine someone paying money for it still.
---
They're in your launcher app....
---
I don't recommend buying from their website. It's a full $60 game on the ofiicial website. But if you want to, here it is [https://fallout.bethesda.net/](https://fallout.bethesda.net/)
---
I would buy it form a market place online, like G2A. [https://www.g2a.com/en-us/fallout-76-bethesda-key-europe-i10000156540001](https://www.g2a.com/en-us/fallout-76-bethesda-key-europe-i10000156540001) $20 there
---
Why on earth do you *not* want this?
---
But yeah, sounds like healing factor mutation.
---
Yeah, it's kind of a pain in the butt that way.
---
O really? wow what a dumpster fire. 
---
Since I've had a few disturbing clown encounters recently, I'd happily kick your ass. Xbox?
---
I love Marsupial and Speed Demon. They are in my top three mutations. I also really like Healing Factor so I never need to remember to heal after a fight, and Class Freak minimizes the Chem penalty. 
---
I believe it might be one of Einstein's field equations. Interesting.
---
If you check the top of the page it will list all of the random drop locations for wearables, that is what it means when an plan is listed as "Wearables random drops". Figured it would be cleaner to just put that instead of rehashing the entire list over and over :P
---
I wouldn't pay money for it lol. 
---
Yea i know this place never checked floor below thx
---
Very true...
---
soooo no you do not know how much money it is making or costing bethsda.
---
you are just speculating the worst case you can imagine because that is what you hope for.
---
You are wrong, there are easy ways to either build for no damage taken or high health return like 1%-100 in under a second. Maybe you should just stop being such a basic build player. 
---
Still a good game but eh
---
AT THE VERY LEAST let us be able to tell the difference between the different sets in our inventory!
---
The more you know...
---
Sometimes the friends list bug out and shows the wrong person online. No idea about the email prob tho.
---
I also have this issue without any ammo perks..also on weapon weight I think it could be bugged sometimes but I reported it
---
The Pack mutation can be a pain, unless they fixed it. The game didn‚Äôt handle partial special points very well, and -.5 special with rank 3 Class Freak mucked some stuff, IIRC. 
---
What bootleg google are you using? 
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.altchar.com/games-news/586388/bethesda-refute-rumours-of-fallout-76-going-free-to-play/amp
---
Also, I guess it's difficult imagining anything about a game if you have never played it. Especially if you have been watching the rubbish YouTubers. 
---
I probably should've mentioned I'm on console. Sorry about that 
---
When it happened to me it was "Robectrons" or "Protecbrains"?  Top half Protectrons on Robobrain tracks.
---
Generals steak house I heard super mutants are more likely for weapons as opposed to ghouls which are more likely for armor generally 
---
Did you come here with the sole intention of being pedantic? All your comments seem to be trashing a game you claim to be trying to download. 
---
Might be just from the Nuka vendor in Whitesprings. Has lots of flavours
---
Remember when you had to walk slow because enemies were hard? Who's damn idea was it to make the hardest place lvl 50. We need a new spot that we can't run in without friends or a plan.
---
FAKE NEWS
---
This is exactly like restarting Pok√©mon Ruby/Sapphire. You get used to having the running shoes, then for the start of the game, movement feels like it‚Äôs slowed to a crawl. I got the same feeling after I accidentally used a radaway without starched genes and lost speed demon. Running isn‚Äôt the same without it. 
---
Lolz
---
Minority?  Top post with pushing 2k upvotes says otherwise 
---
its only on pc through your Bethesda launcher account. The good part is, they'll work on just about any modern system.
---
He's a troll. Basically just wants to comment negative things. Someone told him it's on the Bethesda launcher and his reply was "Oh wow what a dumpster fire. Do not feed the troll.
---
Do you have .45 ammo?
---
He passed through Lakeside Cabins at 5:56am one day. Also found him just south of the Gorge Junkyard around 6 am another day. I don't know if the in game time of day is relevant, I've just been making a note of it in case it is.
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
Hate to pile on more bad news but Bethesda's response time to tickets is really, *really*, **really** bad (really).  I've heard from people waiting 3+ weeks with no response.
---
When I heard there was a multiplayer Fallout game coming, I thought: "Whatever it is won't have VATS and therefore won't be the 'Fallout' I'm used to: There's no way to port VATS to multiplayer because you can't slow time for everyone."
---
And of course, that was correct, and they couldn't port VATS *directly*.
---
Instead, IMHO, at the cost of shortening the sequence of actions you can macro when you execute your complicated VATS sequence to best effect, they nevertheless came up with a much more realistic and immersive version of a tactical battle computer. And while I lose the satisfaction of dropping six enemies with exploding-head shots at a single keystroke, I gain the satisfaction of being able to *move in combat myself*, without VATS holding me in essentially the same position as the macro plays out.
---
I think they handled this challenge *brilliantly*.
---
The decision to have no NPCs, though ‚Äî no quest dialogs, no companions, no personalities more complex than "Who's ready for a good butt-kicking?" ‚Äî simply sux, creating the irony that for introverted games, multiplayer Fallout 76 is dramatically *lonelier* than single-player Fallout 76. I dearly miss Dogmeat, Cait, and Nick.
---
Thanks, sure you don't need anything?
---
Which one is that? I just killed a lvl 45 Vengeful Mothman and he turned to ash and I didn‚Äôt get a photo. 
---
howdy! are you still providing tailoring services?
---
As well as a drop from the SBQ, you can also occasionally find a recipe at the Enclave mutation vendor, but the recipe is like, 19k caps even with Hard Bargain 3
---
Ive watched plenty on twitch, its a meh game worthy of a curious download at best.
---
Simple rule of thumb for workshops only use the free resources. Do not go into white unless you have to say for an extra junk collector at the landfill.   
---
If you do that then you are out nothing but gain a bit. 
---
Ffs go jerk if to NV or something, you troll. 
---
Heard it was free 2 play, couldnt imagine actually spending money on a bethesda game. Looked for download.
---
No, I don't know how much Bethesda lost on FO76. I just hope they go F2P and add much needed content to be able to support the game.
---
Guess we have different opinions lol.
---
Yes what can I do for you
---
Yeh you better go an ask mommy for some vbucjs money instead.
---
Party Boy lvl1(2 perk points) doubles the effect of alcohol.  For example Whiskey now gives +4 STR
---
This one was just a regular mothman, outside Charleston station. The vengeful seems to always attack first.
---
I'll see what I can find out
---
I was wondering why the mats showed up some green n some white

A level 25 can have a unkillable build assasin cavalier build and take 0 damage from a level 200 or even an easy cola perk build where the grape or quatum gets you to 100 in a second or less 
---
Modifiers to SPECIALs don‚Äôt affect what cards you can equip. The only effect I have seen is with Charisma, where your modified Charisma determines how many ranks of a card you can share. 
---
TheQuartering titled his video, ‚ÄúFallout 76 Quietly Prepares To Go Free To Play?‚Äù Which is a huge leap of conclusion from some stores returning potentially excess Christmas stock. Fallout 76 is an online game which all player would simply download.
---
TheQuartering admits in his videos he has no proof. Ultimately the guy created a clickbait video for clicks, Bethesda, called bullshit on his rumours and TheQuartering produced another 10+minute monetised video retracting his rumours. 
---
The shelf copies, the only fact here, play a small part in the whole drama he created.
---
On r/pcgaming, it made it to r/popular...
---
It was a cold morning and last minute warmth snuggles were more important than a big spook. Consider yourself lucky.
---
It still takes plastic to bulk acid. So basically you are converting 2 plastic into 5 waste acid...
---
What if I do 20% from armor and 60% from the perk card? Would that be 80% and be more bang for my buck so to speak? 
---
I mean, that was developed by a different dev but sure.
---
Don't feed the troll, man. He's clearly here to jerk around.
---
Yah man thanks for the offer. Out of curiosity was my headset working?
---
Out of 1.4 million copies of the game sold that yes, makes you a minority. Keep fighting champ but my involvement here is done. Enjoy playing in the corner with the younger users while Bethesda crafts beauty for those that appreciate the game beyond material assets.
---
I also hope you guys wait longer in que.

Is he stealthy?  I am L120 and have never seen :(

No, I'm on PS4. I crap, I TOTALLY FORGOT. My bad
---
Whitesprings is so overrated. You are better off going anywhere in the southeast portion of the map. Or the occasional Uranium Fever event. 
---
I agree completely! The stash limit REALLY exacerbates this problem! I am normally not able to fast travel, but when I am, I am normally very close to being overburdened. Completing a quest is usually enough to overburden me with items I don't always want but can sell. So I roam the wasteland in an eternal state of being overburdened. I wonder if this is how Grahm, the wandering Super Mutant vendor, feels.
---
Me too. I‚Äôll usually have 20-30 cures (I give lots out to friends. )
---
Best bet is to find the plan for the Lever Rifle. Shows up at Grafton (town) vendor fairly often.
---
I always put my camp somewhere east of the Savage Divide mountain range, and sorta in the middle from north to south. You have the Vault on the west side of the map, and your camp more easterly-middle and it helps a lot with travel costs.
---
Feel free to believe the youtubers who spread a rumor based on little to no evidence.
---
Bethesda still hasn't proven to me they can handle  FO76 long term but they weren't the ones caught lying here.
---
Honestly, the only thing that‚Äôs helped me w inventory management is that, and rotating through the combat armors to try for mods. Today was the first day I have 0 junk on my character and my stash is below 575. 
---
Vbucks. Not quite in the mood for your bs at 6.30 am man.
---
Yeah building kept me entertained for a bit.. also went on a hunt to tame a deathclaw but wasn't successful in that venture what so ever. Found myself walking for hours pacifying every creature insight. Good way to kill some boredom tho
---
I get your point and agree it doesnt work in those cases, you still choose to play that way over convenience.  That's not to say there shouldnt be fixes made, but a non PA build utilizing legendary armor with weight reduction suffixes  no longer needs the perk cards for weight reduction.
---
It's all about choice,  tho the game in it's current state is just not designed for non pa users.  The end game is nuke zones which are just designed around using power armor sadly.
---
Yes the vault is awesome too another free travel point
---
Lol... I‚Äôm sure some of the winners did use google...
---
Yeah you should have to make choices about what you grab, but the game is basically a hoarding game that punishes you for hoarding. Also really limits amount of weapons you can stash. I can‚Äôt afford to stash any big weapons, yet I know it will bite me in the ass when I‚Äôm in need of those guns. 
---
I hesitate starting this game up sometimes solely for the fact I don‚Äôt feel like spending 20 minutes playing with my stash limit 
---
Yep lots of people do not know this. Anyways you should be able to pop out two windmills 4 mk 1 turrets and 2 resource collectors without going into the white on most all the workshops. So you get a little more X others not. I try to always take the landfill for the 3 junk there so I go into the white on my third windmill but get that plus more back in about 15 minutes. 
---
You are misinformed. He probably had on Assassin and Sentinels. I've not been able to kill people and I've had on all the perks and aids with TSEs and still not been able to kill them every time. Wait until next week after the nerfs and we can't kill anyone.  
---
I have tried googling this for over an hour and I'm not finding anything about it. But I'll go ahead and redact since I'm obviously wrong here. 
---
Get "Starched Gene" perk level 2, in Luck. 
---
It locks your mutations in place.
---
I fixed the glitch but I stashed them to have more carry weight on my character, when I picked them up to put stuff in my stash it happened
---
What's your in game name? Always down to help out!
---
Nice.
---
Just like the vendors running out of caps. I don't like gating mechanics like this. 
---
I'll add ya tomorrow!
---
Check Twitter. The squashed the rumor
---
people don't get Marsupial for the small carry weight boost.
---
they get it for the double-height jump.
---
Will definitely look you up!
---
Check out r/fo76bazaar and r/market76
---
I've never had it aggro anything, but it also doesn't seem to do much.
---
If you get some lv 1 molerats on you it might kill them.  But I think electrically charged is better for that.
---
Didn't see an actual explanation yet, so my guess would be that he's tagged as BoS faction whereas all the other bots are tagged as some other faction. Probably a generic enemy type faction considering they stay as red on the compass even when non-hostile after mayor for the day.
---
The generic enemy factions will fight anything not in their faction.
---
Respect+
---
Yeah as Mario mentioned above maybe all things are capped at 90%
---
I have never seen this bug but my friends mention it all the time when I am playing on a different platform then they are. The friends list is not shared cross platform but I will get texts from my PC friends when I am with my brother on the ps4 asking why they can't join my world. It's not 100% of the time just every now and then. 
---
I didn't hear you, no.
---
I don't think increasing the stash limit would be the ideal solution. It's more or less a kind of band-aid to a much larger problem.
---
If we are going to see this game expand and grow beyond what we have currently, then just adding more to the stash to accommodate the new content and likewise just won't do so long as raw junk is counted towards it.
---
Looking at other MMOs, I think it would be ideal to give players a secondary stash that handles only the raw materials. A resource stash contains 31 repositories (one for each junk resource type), each of which can have their capacity upgraded (with caps or other rare resources). If other MMOs resort to multi-inventories why not 76?
---
Unfortunately not - the best way to do it is to craft a bunch of them 
---
Ah ok, ill give it a pirate instead lol cheers.
---
In my opinion, if the stash limit was expanded and I mean DRASTICALLY let‚Äôs say about -2000? 
---
Followed by a weight rework on the weaponry as well as other items (just like they made bobby pins weight a lot more reasonably)  the perks would still make sense to me (heavy weapon weight SHOUKD be affected by perks, but where‚Äôs the rifle weight perks? Perhaps in strength? 
---
Sadly equipment/item weight is the last thing on their mind, I don‚Äôt care how much a hunting rifle weighs -when it does less damage with a .50 caliber bullet üòÇ
---
Whats a Vbuck?
---
yAy!! 
---
The issue is he practices double standards, he didn't make a single video even mentioning the red dead redemption 2 cash shop abuse and just pretended it didn't exist and he raves about how amazing that game is so no way he doesn't know about the issue.
---
Astroturfing happens in here too. I watched one of the patch threads and any negative comment would _immediately_ get downvoted by exactly the number of people there are monitoring this sub at Bethesda. I think it was 6, can't remember now, but I checked at the time.
---
Basically, it's like anything in life. If _you_ can think of a way to game the system, then someone is probably already gaming the system in just that way.
---
Thank you so much!! I  knew they were on PC but I figured they would have sent me a message or something. 
---
He's just here to be a troll. Check his other comments.
---
There's a lot here, but there's a lot to this. I've talked to quite a few people who have weight management issues and it usually always boils down to logistics. Improper use of perks, leaving camp with more than you need, not using gear in efficient ways, loots and clearing at the same time, looting things you don't need; it's all just improper logistics and planning. Once you start thinking about how you're collecting things and the order to do it in, it becomes much more manageable.
---
Leaving camp is the first thing. Do you need all the chems you're carrying? When you put them in your stash and complain about the weight, think to yourself, "Do I need to stash 80 Rad-X. If I have 80 now, sell/drop them all, will I still get more since I already managed to get 80?". That's true for most chems and food. Also with food, are you taking 1lb non-perishables or cooked food with buffs (like steaks that increase carry weight). Take for where you're going and what you are doing. If you're not going to a radiated area, do you need 50 Radaway? If you're a Melee build, do you need 30 packs of Mentats? Think about what you need then drop your chem weight to only needing a level 1 perk.
---
Looting buildings is where tons of your weight comes from. I loot Wes-Tek quite a bit because it's close to home and has lots of scrap I need. It also has tons of weighty weapons. When you're first going in, don't have your inventory requiring a perk load-out that needs carry weight (maybe Sturdy Frame). Focus on being able to clear the building. Kill everything before you start looting, even corpses, just leave them on the ground. Once the building is clear, you no longer need all the perks to increase attack and defense so now you can swap to a carry weight/lockpick/hacking perk load-out to clear the building and head home. Only clear one place at a time.  The key point here is to manage your perk load-out for the situation and create the optimal situation for you to swap cards out, this is a concept that should be used all over the game and seems to be the intended design of the entire perk system.
---
Also:
---
* Always keep an eye out for legendary weapons/armors that reduces carry weight of thing or increases strength. Put ultra-light on it and keep it on you. That 4 lb equipment can save you 20-30 lbs of other things. Swap to these when you swap to your carry perk load-out.
---
* Most buildings have crafting stations to break down all junk, weapons, and armor you find. Sort by weight and scrap down to your carry weight for fast travel.
---
* Make use of the highlight function in the components menu. If you never use some junk, you don't need to pick it up.
---
* If possible, cook, repair, and craft on site. Bulk up your lead and aluminum. Some places like Whitesprings or Wes-Tek have multiple stations you can craft to clear a bit of inventory instead of waiting to get back to CAMP.
---
* Use chems and food to increase strength and carry weight.
---
* For a bit of extra carry weight in a carry load-out, grab Radicool and radiate yourself.
---
* Consider using 10lbs to carry a frame of Excavator Armor. I don't do this personally, but I hear it helps.
---
* Alternatively to the Excavator PA, if you're using Sturdy Frame in your normal build, carry a spare set of Deep-Pocketed Leather Armor. Even better if you find Legendary leather with Weightless and/or weight/ammo/food/or junk weight modifiers. That 10-15lbs in extra armor can add 50 lbs to carry weight when you swap to it.
---
If none of this helps at all consider either looting places close to STASH boxes or start moving your CAMP around to make the walk shorter. Using things like Nuka-Cola and Coffee that have short AP buffs helps as well if you NEED everything on you and you NEED to walk home.
---
On the note of Speed Demon, I've never had an issue with keeping up with hunger and thirst. There is food, water, and radaway every where in the game. There's no real reason to walk around with 50 bottles of purified water and a months worth of meals. If you're leaving your CAMP for so long that you're running though 30-40lbs of food and water, even with Speed Demon, you need to consider cooking on the road and making an effort to know where cooking stations are. Once you know where you can cook; food and water are everywhere.
---
Why don't you use trusty google for it?
---
7
---
Absolutely not. 
---
Yeah I get that but mine doesn‚Äôt work even when I unequip all perks and i don‚Äôt use bandolier ever and it doesn‚Äôt work
---
Yikes.
---
I'm not wanting unlimited anything. I love realism and I love a challenge. As it stands the game's weapon durability mechanic and lack of ammo for certain weapons earlier on requires that I carry a ton of weapons to ensure I have a fighting chance against the endlessly respawning waves of enemies.
---
Were things balanced better I wouldn't have to carry several weapons of varying calibers and one or two melee weapons. It was never an issue in earlier Fallout games, but it's an issue now. Factor in the random disconnects and poor save syncing, and I'm left with a generally laborious and souring experience. 
---
You da best
---
Dunno, however the mod that increases weapon reload speed stacks. Some of my weapons reload faster than I can shoot them.
---
No
---
Gun weight reductions don't affect mods.
---
Hmmm should I choose a clickbait YouTuber or a shitty developer? Tough choice...

Made me laugh during my wife's show, she gave me the evil eye. GG.

As far as I remember, Speed Demon overwrites any and all perks it affects. So, no. Could be wrong, though, can't check right now.

You fully edited the post I replied to. Pathetic.
---
If you want to go crazy you can max your vats perks to show what weaknesses and damage resistances enemies have. Simply make a list and then remove the perk. Happy hunting

ok, ign illmaticxdragn

Tell me how many guns you can carry in real life.

Sucks that community isn't at the forefront of gaming anymore.

Na,

It's a fallout game. Alts are a way of life
---
and you know they lost money on it how exactly? more head canon?
---
I actually really like both of these as an alternative. While i still don't  think my way is too easy, my feedback has said otherwise and i think this is a clever middle ground.
---
Part of what i worry about with a harder system is when the real late game and dlcs come out. There is a high chance that the "hardcore raider" mindset will kick in and anyone under 200 won't be allowed into raids because they haven't grinded out enough passives and might slow down the group.
---
While this problem is far away, it negatively impacts the potential for people to make multiple characters of different builds and seem "raid ready"
---
Read a post here some time ago, that helped me out. Unfortunately I do not remember the name or title. 
---
I had a similar problem with the turrets. Nothing was stored, they were simply vanished but the budget was still high and nothing helped. 
---
The guy solved it by deleting the  structure where the element was attached to, in my case it was the wood tile where my turret was placed on. As soon as I had deleted the single element and replaced it with a new one, my budget bar changed and the invisible elements were visible and stored. Then I was able to delete the stuff and my budget was realistic again.
---
Keep fingers crossed and hope you get it solved without replacing your whole camp.

Fallout 76 is an online game which all players would simply download. The store DVD‚Äôs are probably excess Christmas present stock. My PC does not have a DVD drive. 
---
Andromeda was never pulled and is still on sale the same place it has always been, Origin store, and they have an 80% sale on the game in Origin Uk now. ¬£7
---
Teach a man to fish. Show them how to plant crops in a camp. Where to find the ingredients for healing salve and disease cure. Teach them about marking junk for collection and what components are valuable. 
---
I absolutely love this build. I love the overall aesthetic and its a really creative spot to put a base. I admit, I thought about stealing this idea for a brief second, but it would make me feel bad. You should absolutely post this on r/fallout76settlements
---
If that's not how the game is supposed to be played, well, that sucks. I loved decorating my houses with the stuff I'd find in the last 2 games and skyrim. In 4 I had a full on armory with armor displays and a wall of weapons. I saved all kinds of situational gear. It was fun, I enjoyed it. If they decided to remove that fun for some reason all I can say is "damn, that sucks, that was how I played these games."
---
 
---
wow this is a very old post lmfao
---
Nope
---
Its viable but it takes a lot of work to keep up with ammo.   You need lots of Lead, Steal and Acid.   
---
Agreed
---
I'd say 5 hours a week or less is casual, 6-21 hours a week is moderate, 22-39 is hardcore, and 40+ is literally a full time job. 
---
Yep, for sure.
---
Just gotta sit back and remove yourself from the equation to try and understand what's a voice and what isn't. Makes casual browsing so tiring. 
---
Well heavy was viable with two shot non explosive. But thats being nerfed this month. So no.
---
Maybe? That‚Äôs determinate on what you believe to be playable, whether its glitches or story content you‚Äôre looking for will determine that. That said maybe hold off until the vaults are released. That‚Äôll show more of where Bethesda wants to direct this game for the future. Also I won‚Äôt be shocked if the price fluctuated again soon with another sale. The chances aren‚Äôt really that low so it might be more worthwhile to hold out a tad longer like I unfortunately didn‚Äôt do and spent the full $60 when it dropped to half two weeks later. Still salty about that one
---
Yeah but the weight limit is still way to low, the amount of junk you need in this game is ridiculous. By the time you are higher level this should become less of a problem but it ends up becoming more of a problem than ever.
---
There is a metric that determines when this happens.  I think it's 3x or 4x your carry weight.
---
I will, right after a nuclear fallout scenario happens and life mimics the imaginary world we're all inhabiting on Fallout. 
---
I am hurt by your example and feel that might be an attack on me.  
---
the poison aura hits everything so you are attacking even if not actively 
---
This is probably the best way to do it, or have designated friends camps always appear in your game. With the way servers work I can‚Äôt see any other option.
---
On a side note how ‚ÄúCat in the Hat‚Äù is it getting in here?
---
An adult looks at the game as a whole experience. I'm sorry but you'dhave to be a child that gets excited over power armour or an adult with a weird ass hoarding mentality.
---
Im stating fact. The carey weight is equal and I think realistic. You also gotta eat food, drink water, eat and repair things. 
---
If you don't like it: get lost honestly.
---
It is the most immature agenda to argue against the challenge of the game. I can only imagine how you liaison with your parents.
---
Which is absolutely nonsense and will hopefully be fixed haha
---
It would help a lot to have a the correct weight of the item in the stash. Fusion cores weigh 0.3 lb on my character, but the full 3 lb in stash. In the transfer menu it still says it weighs 0.3 lb in stash though. 
---
We also need a weight total at the bottom of each tab for characters &amp; the stash. It is too time consuming tracking weights of all your items to find out which weight reduction perk card provides the most benefit at that particular time. For me it fluctuates among food &amp; drink, chems &amp; junk depending on the situation.
---
Not usssss
---
You missed the bit where someone starts capturing your workshop to enable PvP, then fast-travels wherever you are on the map, murders you with a TSE and takes your junk.
---
I wouldn't recommend using them except for resources that are tough to get otherwise. They were more useful back when I didn't know where to find anything.
---
That's how I accidentally sold my "All Rise"
---
What are some decent weapon types to switch to then? Some of my friends have started to play this again so I'm looking to get back into it.
---
I want this on xbox so bad
---
You can drink inert radioactive flux? Weird. I didnt even think to try that.
---
Stable? No. Crashes are frequent. And there's still plenty of issues besides the crashes. 
---
All slots in assassin sentinel's (3* legendary armor) and you are effectively immune to pvp damage.  Only way to take damage is if you get staggered.  From range this basically won't happen, so melee-only.
---
The gear is exceedingly rare so farming it yourself would take a **long** time.  There was a time players would trade it but now the secret is out so if a player has this gear they likely won't part with it.
---
I'm guessing this situation is on Bethesda's radar tho, and will be patched eventually.
---
I do not know, but you guys should probably thank the redditors that made these posts because it prompted Bethesda to finally officially respond and quell all of the rumors that those 2 game sites were trying to spread. They responded a few hours ago.
---
They're a deathtrap based on pvp.  Why would you take one aside from getting Plans, when so much junk is all over the place.
---
The rewards in Mats is frankly pathetic, and it's easier to use the guides on Reddit to find Mats with a few server hops maybe for most things.
---
I think it's just another element that is a good idea but in real game life doesn't work well now.  I say now, as PvP players have worked out how to farm workshop owners.
---
Gah, that is a disheartening fact. 
---
What about people have to contribute material to expand the "T.O.W.N"
---
Preaching to the choir.  I quit Fallout 76 until they fixed the stash box so I don't have to carry literally everything around.  I've posted this numerous times but everyone flames me saying get over it, etc.  Glad your post for recognition and not just flamed and trolled.
---
I am the strongest.  super.  Mutant.
---
I was thinking about this but I dont think it will happen due to one main reason: hydraulic bracers. Hydraulic bracers raises strength by 15 per bracer so it would be an instant op build. 
---
What kind of cap price were you looking for?
---
Ah, mainly that he tends to scrape the bottom of the barrel a lot. He also beats a dead horse in nearly every 76 video he makes, i.e. most of his recent 76 content is at least 30-40% a rehash of everything he's said in the previous 76 content. Milking the subject for views is a really good way to lose credibility and just look like the gamer version of Drama Alert.
---
He needs to stick to the main problems and keep the focus alive on those, not to bring up every little thing he can find, because that leaves the viewer with the impression of petty whining, rather than the genuine complaints that really exist. But, gotta have muh 10 minutes for those adsense bucks, right?
---
That's why he gets on my nerves.
---
True story!
---
Well if they are on display in your 'home', then you aren't carrying them around, and they aren't in your stash, are they?
---
Same
---
I haven't been following, what are "the vaults"?
---
What about cannibal, you can keep less meats on you, just eat humanoids. I wish our stash was much higher, about double. I kinda want to load fo4 and see how much crap I store XD
---
Cities: Skylines might be for you.

I cant hear you through 30 years of games, i'm sure i'd love to play reddead but i just cant find the time.
---
I did thanks, torrents away!
---
DLC that should include side quests. Maybe changes to the main story? I haven‚Äôt looked into them as I haven‚Äôt wanted to spoil anything in this $60 experience. Truth is I kinda stopped caring a week in. If you love MMOS then this is a decent game for you. If you love Fallout for Fallout maybe not so much. The two share a name but gameplay and goals within the game are vastly different due to the way they‚Äôre designed and who they‚Äôre marketed for
---
It's not just condition dude, it's paints and mods per category. I don't know what that looks like, and I agree with you that limits are way too low, but unless you're familiar with the way FO76 was put together how do you actually know they didn't do everything you described.
---
The game could be using every fix you put forward and for all we know it isn't enough.
---
It was nothing but clickbait rumor
---
Yes, you should be able to scrap ammo at the tinker‚Äôs bench for lead, steel and plastic(depending on what you‚Äôre scrapping). 
---
The blood packs thing is wrong btw. Blood packs can be used to mass produce stimpacks and weigh less. So I just keep a stash of blood packs in my stash for if I ever need more stimpacks. 
---

I had to dig through so many google images for this. [Vats Stats](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FZnjU.png)

I wouldn't care about the astroturfed voting if it weren't for reddit's "hide anything with more than N downvotes" feature, which I know they're intentionally abusing to make their game look better-received.
---
To be fair he didn't actually start anything with them. Sure he took a workshop but he wasn't openly hostile towards them from what he told us. 
---
What a shit bag.
---
I down voted, you asked that if I do to leave a comment. Here's why. 
---
I have consistently kept my stash under 400, still. It's part of the games challenge.
---
Everybody wanted immersion, yet complain when you can't have half a ton of stuff that magically transports to any and every stash box.
---
Everybody wants server stability but they demand to increase stash limits. We all know how that would go.
---
Everybody complains there is no end game and they want DLC already. "We're tired of just grinding for more scrap". Yet then we end up back at this discussion. 
---
How about this, we all get an extra 200 pounds of stash, but at the trade off of it being accessable to any and every player. 
---
A compromise for the PvP thirsty, and the pack rat collectors.
---
Let's make this game real interesting.

You cannot sell the chassis, and if you scrap the chassis the parts go into inventory.  You can drop the chassis but I'm pretty sure I didn't do that.
---
Sucks, man.

7 of the 10 best selling games on steam last year were 3+ years old.

While I agree that the STASH should be increased, if you have four alts for junk storage, no amount of STASH will make you happy.

I doubt its more than three buddy. Let alone the aid, apparel, junk and all those bottle caps.

Sorry you want to carry more than that? You already do, you actually want more.

Thanks for reminding me.  Don‚Äôt know how I could forget the Mayor and MODUS

The ghouls AI seriously, I was in a road near whitesprings and I met a group of ghouls and then suddenly they teleported  and killed me, seriously wth reduce their running speed or something 
---
Different idea myself.
---
Enclave bunker , Modus : We have now gained access to our neural-control interface¬†(NCI) machine. For the price of 5,000 caps that are used as currency in the wastelands. We can implant you with a chip allowing you to reset and relearn abilities. 
---
Also Bethesda something you need to do is clean up the perk cards. If a perk card is maxed you should he able to choose the star level used in it. Instead of requiring up to 5 versions of the same card ( pointless system ). 
---
When you do this the best thing you can do to make sure no blow back is reset everyones perks. Allowing them a free full respec. Do this at the same time as bringing in the NCI chips and boom the community would love ya lads.
---
thx mate I will grab the plan sometime soon. Just haven't gotten around to it as I am hooping around trying to grab plans and caps/ I have a relaxed play-style. 
---
That seems like a good way to keep the load down on the servers or whatever reason there isn‚Äôt more stack space now
---
Cool and now maybe this subreddit can thank the people that made concerned posts about it prompting Bethesda to make an official statement, instead of downvoting them for 3 days when they read about copies getting recalled. Because god forbid people get upset when they find out their game may be going free and try to get more info and understanding on the official reddit about the speculation...
---
You know, since if those posts weren't made we would not know the official answer. But !@$% those guys. Obvious trolls.
---
Lmao yea so i built this epic brick house and i had to settle for no roof lol
---
Got it, thanks for the info!
---
Pro: perfect for mass artillery (like 3 or 17!) and blowing up nearby people's camps. You'll get a Bounty but it's a sure way to devastate a camp with a boom!  Just throw the smoke artillery grenade and wait for the show. If the owner of the camp engages in pvp with you before your artillery lands... do I need to finish? 
---
Must be true this guys a scientist. 
---
There‚Äôs this YouTube channel of this lady who does camp locations and I think she‚Äôs up to over 40 spots now and a good number of them are impressive AF (a full diner! Multiple caves)
---
I think the channel owner was called ‚Äúgamermomover50‚Äù
---
&gt; I hesitate starting this game up sometimes solely for the fact I don‚Äôt feel like spending 20 minutes playing with my stash limit
---
This is me EVERY TIME I log on because I realize that I didn‚Äôt clean up my inventory before I logged out the last time and I now need to spend 30 minutes to an hour making very difficult decisions.
---
i am having this problem. i have a rank 5 makeshift warrior card but cant put on the spiked rocked mod.how do i get it to work?
---
I was thinking about how you could buy bank space and daily you could increase various stats in ESO. The grind wasn‚Äôt bad. It also gives purpose to daily login besides vendor refresh. 
---
There are still bugs, ranging from mildly irritating to downright incapacitating. Patches fix some things &amp; break others. Not much in terms of replay value or long term support. 
---
Had I not been given the game as a gift, I would not be playing it. If you find a cheap copy, it'll be a good time killer. But if you want a true FO experience, stick with its single player predecessors.
---
I would like to see passive perk cards that don't take up points on the special.  They could limit the passive perk cards to the same number as the special if necessary but perks that are passive knowledge in nature should not use your special points.  These passive perks would include science,  camp related building, and the skills such as armorer, ammo smith, repairs, etc.  Having to swap these skills out when your doing a workshop or camp thing is tedious and adds zero to gameplay.
---
My username notwithstanding  (it was a phase) I *am* a physicist irl.
---
My team and I all view the deadliest creature in the game as the Colonel Gutsy.  SBQ has nothing on those bastards.  In fact, if you can kite SB's to the Gutsies on patrol near Watoga, it's fun to watch the turkey shoot, like schadenfraude galore.
---
They had larger capacity storage planned for the money shop.
---
The "unrelated incident" in question, which you disingenuously linked to "harassment", involved him being physically assaulted in an altercation started by another person. That person is now being sued.
---
I hate that lil bastard, because I always forget about him until I jump off the cliff. Nothing like landing with stagger directly in front of a deathclaw to wake you up.
---
I set my camp up to have a take one leave one box. I built next to a open world box an have signs to let people know. When I'm online I drop extra items in there. It works while I'm away! I've come back an people have taken an left a ton of things! 
---
Had. Signed out about an hour ago. Sorry.
---
I had a camp southeast of Top of the World that had one spawn there he was always waiting for me when I came home. Good guy, I still stop by and kill him occasionally. 
---
How do you all have time to play so much? Maybe I'm just not levelling up as fast because I just go exploring the environment, I never get tired of that, always find new details. Would recommend 
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** rapidwiz! ^(hug)
---
Steal away mate... I will likely move to another location as soon as something catches my eye.
---
I usually have a disease due to ghouls
---
Start in watoga and take the highway north. Stay on the highway and then when it turnes left near abbies bunker keep going north until you hit the crashed vertibird. You'll get plenty of random encounters. I did this once a day and I eventually found my lvl 21 deathclaw and tamed him. He now protects me so i can afk at my base.
---
Not a bad idea at all.
---
1 stash weight per level after level 50?.
---
So at my level 126 i would have 76 bonus weight for my stash. Could even offer a 5 weight bonus every 5 levels like perk cards to boot.
---
Because Watoga is a no man‚Äôs land. Li-te-rally. 
---
Unfortunately I already played the hell out of the predecessors, which is why I'm itching to get this version of FO. I know it's not the same due to lack of real NPC's and all, but keep telling myself it can't be that bad for FO game :D
---
*Life... Life finds a way.*
---
All the negative effects of the diseases would be the downside I imagine.
---
I had my reallllly good dragon vanish from my stash box upon relog.
---
How about a stuffed bear launcher out of the artillery and you use a terminal to set things like range and bears per shot
---
&gt; lets not spread misinformation about ppl intentionally.
---
Funny how the people complaining about other people spreading misinformation on a thread about misinformation are doing it themselves. And they took to it without a moment's hesitation.
---
The game is perfectly playable in it's current state. It's not perfect, you should know that going in, but I'm have on hell of a good time with it.
---
No i figures it out I unequipped everything logged and requippdd and my weight dropped a ton....def bugged
---
If you have any points in Perception, there‚Äôs a perk where you can view any enemy (or player‚Äôs) resistances via vats and react accordingly until you‚Äôre comfortable with identifying your opponents‚Äô weaknesses without it.
---
I didn't remove anything placed on other structure I built :(
---
Its pretty amazing the staying power of PC games. Still play battlefield 3 at 4k 60fps to this day :)
---
Well, one of these people physically assaulted the guy, so you could see how he'd think he was the victim.
---
Why can‚Äôt we just make the stash limit go up as you level up?
---
They really have honestly. Now any youtuber can post lies or talk about made up shit and get thousands of views on a matter of hours. That kind of avalanche moves people even ones on the edge and they just believe things without reading into it, and or finding proof it isn't true. Then you get a handful other videos on the same topic and it's now masses of misinformed people spewing falsehoods and they truly think they are in the right and anyone who thinks differently needs to be crucified. 
---
I ran with the Awareness perk for a bit, and everything high-level also seemed to have high resistances. So the short answer is that any armor penetration is great against anything that you don't one-shot anyway.
---
The one likely exception is that if your damage is high enough, the armor may already be ignored, so further armor penetration wouldn't help.
---
This is the Quick-Boy view. Like other have said hit the 1st/3rd person view change button (v on pc, giant pad on ps4, two little squares button on xbox) while looking at your pip boy.

I have so much invested into carry weight, from perk cards to armor, to aid items. It‚Äôs insane...lol.

That would basically remove any vestige of character specialization. It's literally five attributes at 12, other two at 11.  It's hard to pretend you have a different character layout when the largest stat difference is likely 3 of 15.
---
Even beyond that, if acknowledging that there is generally at least one attribute that most players don't find that useful for any of their play styles (for me, that is Endurance, because most the perks meh and you really don't need a maxed out charisma), you could leave that stat 'low' and have a 15 / 15 / 5 / 9 / 10 / 15 / 13 build with every combat attribute maxed, L3 perk sharing and emptying out vendor caps supplies, all the durability loss reduction and crafting you'd need, and crit for days - all with lowest stat still a 5 (my melee build character has a charisma of 1).  15s are supposed to be unusual, not half of everyones build.
---
&gt;  it would still be low enough that no one would be able to max out every SPECIAL 
---
Technically true (the best kind!) but a distinction without a significant difference in this case.  At the current 50 points you have to make some real tradeoffs. At 60 don't need as many hard choices. At 75 you'd effectively would be able to pull off any build you want at will once you have the cards, missing only some convenience choices.
---
Yea after I got marsupial, I grinded up to 32 just for that

Gotta love that 100+ weight the excavator armor gives
---
Tonight at level 29 I found the handmade plans in the locked safe at the Clarksburg shooting range while simply cruising to restock some random mats.  While i don't know about vendor spawns compared to world spawns, i suspect some folk are reading a little too much into the RNG.
---
I would suggest that to keep it from being overpowered, make it once every ten levels, UP TO level 100. After that, no more perks.
---
You get a debuff on you that lasts longer per 100 caps you don't have. Making you do 50% less damage i believe to others (pvp only).
---
You can get them for free in a cabin between the mire and the savage divide.

Oh, and one other incident just last night when I, at level 34, followed a level 130+ guy in to West Tek Laboratories and accidentally shot him while trying to help him kill some mutants.  I forgot to turn on pacifist so I was of course wanted.  We stared at each other silently for a couple seconds while we processed what had just transpired.  We both knew what had to happen so without saying a word he humanely and compassionately put me down to spare me from being hunted down like an animal, it really was an act of kindness, or at least that's how I took it.
---
Not sure I understand. When you die the only thing you lose is your junk items-screws, wood, steel etc. You dont lose weapons, armor, ammo etc, just junk. I hope you didnt restart because you thought you lost everything.
---
If your experiencing something else and truly have lost all of your items then I dont know what to tell you. I would say file a support ticket but from what I have read before they do not restore lost items.
---
I drop excess plans for people. Hopefully they find something useful and pass along the rest.
---
I‚Äôm at the build limit and I have no turrets, no resource extractor, and only one industrial water purifier, but god damn my CAMP looks amazing. I‚Äôd love a little more space. 
---
You seem to forget that some of us who haven't purchased Fallout 76.. purchased all of their other titles before this IE: Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 3, Fallout 4 and the originals. It's not fake news if everyone is talking about it and you're talking about it and giving it even more credibility. When did having a discussion become a reason to be triggered and censor a different point of view for simply existing? 
---
This is the real answer
---
A tip for this. At the start of every session I look at my junk. If I am running low/high on a certain resource I tag/untag it for pickup in the pip boy. Anything I have excess of I bulk to sell to vendors.
---
Would be down, what‚Äôs your psn?
---
This very common, actually. For example, there are private companies that offer American political candidates bot services on major social media platforms. Basically, they generate hundreds of thousands of followers in order to create the illusion that the contract is more popular than he really is. Both Barack Obama and Donald Trump have had hundreds of thousands of followers removed from Twitter after they were determined to be fake accounts. Candidates, companies, and others do this kind of thing all the time.
---
Pack rat applies to junk + base/broken down materials + bulked materials on your persons. üòÅ

Dunno what you mean by foreign (lol) but I'm lucky in Europe, everyone I play with seems to be international. Maybe get a VPN or something. It might also have to do with the time of day you're playing. Trying playing at 3 am and you might get Europeans.
---
My C.A.M.P. has level 0 locks so anyone can get in, beds, crafting tables and a stash box. My 2nd floor stays locked bit that's my private space lol. That's about all the help I offer. You are completely right, grinding is the name of the game. If I could place plans I might place some of the more common ones I find around the world but that's about it 
---
Joking aside though, it really should be changed so he's neutral to the Watoga bots, it can be a bit of a pain having to look for him because he's run off after them, and then you can't trade because he's busy killing them all.
---
After nerf I don't see them being used much
---
Yeah I roll with about 50% rads at least to get +5 strength from radicool which pairs well with my Adrenal mutation causing more damage the lower my health. I have all rifleman and tank killer with Bolstering armor so it pays off being low health
---
Take your racism talk elsewhere. This is a gaming forum, and no one wants that here. Show some tact.
---
I have a piece of armor that does that. 
---
Well, it probably cost less to make than ESO since all the assets come from FO4, but the time for the studios involved would still be substantial. We can estimate sales of about 1.5 million using PS4 numbers.
---
The amount of current players has nosedived quite significantly, so I can't see how you expect this game to make a profit. But some of you guys seem dead sure this is a blockbuster game that is raking in the cash, you must have your reasons, care to share? 
---
It took me forever to get that from Whitesprings. When I finally finished there were ghouls littering the ground a scorchbeasts screeching overhead and i broke my explosive 50 caliber machine gun and I had had enough. 
---
No it‚Äôs rng. Same as any other place. I got a three-star explosive lever-action and a two-shot handmade at Whitesprings.
---
It seems obviously that the server integrity isn't up to the standard they'd want before adding numbers to the STASH. I'd prefer a second STASH type that was cross character and only accessible from the menu so what's in it can't affect a server's integrity. Would work like such:
---
* Main Menu item for I.T.E.M.S Box (Inventory Transfer and Enhanced Management System)
---
* I.T.E.M.S opens up a menu with all items in it on the right and your currently selected character's S.T.A.S.H. on the left.
---
* From here you can move inventory bewteen STASH and ITEMS. Since it's not on a server, there's no worry about large quantities of items hurting much.
---
* The ITEMS box would be tied to the player (not character) allowing all your of characters to share the same inventory in the ITEMS box.
---
It's common to have more than personal storage in pretty much every MMO I've ever played whether it be something like this or Guild Banks. Just a thought of something I'd rather push for than increased stashes.
---
Another "issue". why are plants growing in street and rocks??

Details make games great.

---
That‚Äôs a good thing they squashed the rumors at least.  
---
Played FOnline years ago and had a blast.  Pretty sure most Americans don't know about it.
---
I‚Äôve had the game when it was first released. I've already explored all of the land. I only play when I have off from work which is at night and the weekends.
---
dey took er jerbs
---
yes all of my junk -- I restarted as my CAMP wouldn't increase its budget despite me leveling up 5 levels and I no longer would get the "mission" to retrieve my loot -- so I started over and everything was pretty good until I lost my loot in the center of the Earth (again) --- it's more about putting out a quality product after 3+ months --- I can't deal with server disconnects and blue screens but the in game failures I have a problem with -- but yes thanks for letting me know -- it's good to repost for newer players -- 
---
You could use the same technology from FO4. Maybe 5000 caps per point shift as an alternative to level grinding.
---
Regarding cleaning up the cards, I‚Äôd like to see a turn in system for Atomic Shop credit to permanently remove cards. 
---
Powered Gates Plan - Grahm Sells it
---
Thanks for the info i wish there was a way to pvp without caps so you could do it more without going broke. I wonder how thats going to work after the patch
---
Powered Gates plan found mine on Graham.
---
Does the other player still get caps
---
Thanks 
---
Cause that would be broken
---
What we need is to make all aid and ammo weightless, and have infinite stash space like in fo4, at least for raw materials. Then the game will be playable. 
---
This is only if you're wanted though, op just said pvp.
---
You can save ammo by using a flechette harpoon gun or melee against trash mobs and the gatling gun against most stuff. Save the 50cal for when you really need the dpm.
---
Should be fine in a team because everyone else can give you their steel &amp; lead.
---
Being new to PvP I just assumed everyone used 2 shot explosive weapons. Being I had dense and fireproof and could stand on a car and blow it up with no damage but radiation I assumed I was good to go for PvP. I didn't know about -damage from players, anti armor, sentinel, etc.
---
Yea, its the helmet jtself
---
Many issues still need to be resolved. If you can get past the blue screens and lag it‚Äôs a great game. 
---
Definitely. I was also thinking it could roll from where you‚Äôre at, if an arbitrary level was picked as an incentive for new players.  A new daily, or an existing one could open for higher levels. 
---
I remember I was playing with a buddy and we were rolling around for about an hour. We go to his base to craft and he hops out of his PA and he's wearing the fireman outfit with that hat and I just busted up. 
---
So *fucking* ridiculous. 
---
Is there a actual limit to the amount you carry? Does at some point all those items make the game lag? Can you carry 2000+ weight and just deal with walking all the time?
---
I like this idea. I‚Äôve been wanting a place to build my fallout dream home with my heterosexual life mate. The best we can do is two somewhat close river side cabins. Make this happen Bethesda! 
---
Bright Eyes, no idea what it means tho
---
Now you need chameleon and surprise wary travelers 
---
Stay long enough and you'll see phoneix go ham on them and proceed to find every bot and destroy them.
---
To be totally fair, I never said he did. 
---
Really? I'd never seen them before. I think they're a hoot and have traded my grizzled gunslinger garb for a down-on-his-luck holey moley look.
---
Nah you only get the caps they have man. I cleared a 2k bounty from the ahole griefing all these low level bases. I was rewarded 37 caps for this task.
---
I would guess go with the one who wasn't proven wrong this time?
---
Bright Eyes?
---
His last video about Red Dead is talking about how the entire games online economy is set up for microtransactions.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zE4cjUkJzM
---
No. I use Anti-Armor ro collect bounties on anyone.
---
I love them but yeah, they go great with the chainsaw. 
---
Which platforms are you on?
---
Dynamic faction storylines? 
---
For example, imagine the Raiders have a much larger player base than the Responders and the BoS. To combat this Bethesda could implement a dynamic player driven story(via voting or an automated system) that would allow two factions to make alliances with one another. Essentially it would create one temporary faction between the Responders and BoS that could oppose the Raiders. Could have "defend" events where allied factions attack T.O.W.N.s to assert superiority that would then apply multipliers to other events around the map for victorious groups(for example a 2x cap bonus or double rewards for items). Players could commit to defending their T.O.W.N with other players on the server through resource donation and manually defending(this would give a purpose to PvP). 
---
I'm imagining getting an event notification that a T.O.W.N raid is beginning and fast traveling back to set up defenses with other players in your faction. People hopping on mics to establish defenses and share ammo/chems. Setting up quick battle plans and fortifying every part of the T.O.W.N. Players in the same faction could have matching power armor paints gained only through quests pertaining to your chosen faction to act as a sort of unifying uniform. 
---
Could be really fun
---
This is a good news indeed! Because it means that Fallout 76 is gonna fail and be unplayable next if it becomes F2P. Some of my friends said this game won‚Äôt last long, which made me worry a lot. Hope Fallout 76 and Fallout series be of prosperity.lol
---
Move it away from walls and other structures and you should be fine.
---
I stopped playing because inventory management became too troublesome.
---
Everytime im in my miners power amour my weight limit goes from 265 to 465 even though its meant to be  365.
---
üôÅ
---
Another way to do this, without having to add additional slots to the perks menu, would to introduce a mechanic to reduce the costs of perk cards every 10 levels. Instead of having Paragon slots you could have prestige cards. Each perk card could have a min/max level, so you could include all the cards without it being too op.
---
For example, you could have all the lock pick perks min/max at 0/1. When you prestige it you drop it's cost to equip to 0. With perks such as Rifleman, you could min/max it at 2/3. Allowing you to reduce max level cost to 2. Even just have every perk card able to reduce it's max level cost by 1 would make a huge difference and allow some of the passive perks to become free.
---
Glad to hear you're enjoying it! 
---
Make sure you dump all your Junk in your Stash, then craft, that should fix it :) I had the same issue and it worked for me.
---
Added. Anyone else down add me. 
---
If you did everything by then already, no game developer in the world would be able to satiate you. 
---
Yeah only case i know of pvp.
---
I never farmed Patrol Duty or Harper‚Äôs Ferry to try to get the plans but now somehow on my level 90 character it is letting me scrap handmade guns to unlock mods. Only thing that changed recently was I got a legendary two-shot handmade drop a few weeks ago.
---
Looks like a game between people who loved each other before the bombs fell or after and they didn‚Äôt make it.
---
&gt; vendor/distributor agreements where if X product failed to sell Y%, then there was some manner of buyback/refund agreement in place where the retailer could send back an agreed percentage of copies to help recoup some of their losses
---
Damn  I know 76 tanked sale wises but i didnt expect it to be so bad that even retailers would be "fuck that i want a refund"
---
Well that's good to know at least. Was that at charisma 15? My main character has 15 charisma and the party girl perk. 
---
As soon as I figure out how to nuke I'll be nuking the hell out of SBQ. I'm working on getting my promotion right now, so hopefully soon. 
---
Thanks for replying -- 
---
What retailers are pulling it from their shelves? it was prominently on display at Target yesterday 
---
I am a big fan of the Medic Pump for the torso. It applies a stimpack whenever you hit 40% health. It doesn‚Äôt have a cool down timer like the perk card.
---
Calibrated shocks on both legs are great for extra carry weight.
---
And I personally love the Tesla Bracers for both arms. When my axe breaks, then I just punch. It is fun.
---
Of course you haven‚Äôt at level 9, but that days coming bud.
---
I dont really mind inventory management itself, its part of survival esque games. But the op is right. Why do i have to even have weight reduction perks in a game where im limited in the number of perks i can use. The game is virtually unplayable with at the least traveling pharmacy and thru hiker, and depending on build you may want to use bear arms, ordinance express, batteries included. Its kind of ridiculous that weight perks can potentially take up a third of your special points.
---
This is a fantastic idea! 
---
&gt; People defending it, I don't really understand their point of view.  
---
It's like Stockholm Syndrome at this point.  But I'm not one to talk. I'm still paying this turd of a game, and every time I turn it off, I wonder to myself, "why?"
---
"Alright boys, he just blew through two years worth of work, let's get back to it!"
---
I mean there's a bug that randomly shows people who are offline online 
---
Executioners sledge hammer üòä
---
I bet they are waiting with the good stuff until people spend their earned in game atoms on mediocre items.
---
Only if it's remixed to be sang by Molemen.
---
If if I have 50% armor penetration, it just cuts all these numbers by half?
---
Try r/fallout76bazaar
---
I think that Bethesda needed to squash the people making real money on virtual weapons first and I agree that melee build can have enough damage resistance that it's just as strong as a normal persons health bar so it need to be looked at 
---
Bethesda you've fooled us for the last time 
---
I'm on
---
If you're talking the second link, then, yeah that's fair. I should have read it more carefully. 
---
I did, however, read the entirety of the Polygon article. Multiple people corroborated what Sprankle said about Hambly's behaviour. That video was way worse than just being uncomfortable, and there were way more than just two tweets directed at her.
---
which is not the downside of the mutation, I guess
---
 Try r/fo76bazaar
---
I've stricken that one out. I'll leave it there so that people know what you're talking about, but I shouldn't have included that one in my previous comment.
---
Garage door plans are on the floor round the back of site Charlie but other powered doors usually grahm or watoga vendors have and advanced connectors for number pad 
---
Yay I completed an Event...and now i'm 35 pounds overweight.  We shouldn't be forced to dump loot simply because we're nowhere near our Camp or Train Staion
---
Yes the bullets go through you charictor straight out the screen and into your face crazy how real games are getting these day
---
Honestly it is about on par in terms of playablility with any game now to me. there are a few issues that still need to be fixed but you can still play it without any problem. 
---
Done that
---
It just works my man, it just works
---
Not at all if someone is under 20 caps its most likely an accident. Better to tell them to put their junk in their stash so you can clear it for them. Just TSE weapons got duped onto the masses so every tom , dick and harry has them.
---
Mind you i want to use my flamer and laser gun but they break in 3 seconds.... so Bethesda has not given us too much wiggle room.
---
We should be able to forgive bounties and group memebers should not be able to get bounties in our camps but these are different posts.
---
Something Something *NPC* .
---
How many rifles do you carry, out of curiosity?  Those things are insanely heavy.  These days I use mostly heavy weapons of various types and Bear Arms is the only weight reduction perk I generally use.  I'm also getting very focused on minimizing what I carry.
---
except the game is legitimately worth f2p at this point. 
---
True.
---
Maybe have 12-16 slots per faction, or some other mechanic to balance things out.
---
Or instead of getting a town faction spot you are able to set up a camp, but you don‚Äôt get a town spot.
---
I‚Äôm only throwing out ideas to be built upon.
---
&gt; Why is everyone so dramatic about this release? 
---
It's not about drama, it's about fact.
---
Here's a link to the very first feedback post that BGS officially had made in the fo76 sub:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9v0886/beta\_thankyou\_and\_addressing\_your\_feedback/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9v0886/beta_thankyou_and_addressing_your_feedback/)
---
I lot of them a decent responses but let's note three of them:
---
Response 1 - PTT
---
&gt; **Push-to-Talk \[UPDATED\]**: While we aim to create a consistent experience no matter what platform you‚Äôre on, we understand that some of you on PC would like the option for Push-to-Talk. Our goal with voice chat being on by default is to highlight that the world is alive with real people, other players like you. We like to start with encouraging player interaction and **wil**l ~~look into adding this in the future~~ **be adding this in the near future**. 
---
Note what the original post said before they corrected it a few hours later:
---
&gt;We like to start with encouraging player interaction and will look into adding this in the future.
---
BGS pretty much went from "we'll think about adding it sometime into the future" to "ok ok, we'll add it very soon".
---
Response 2 - FOV Slider
---
&gt; **FOV Slider:** We haven‚Äôt supported FOV sliders in our previous games as it is known to break a lot of animations and causes a lot of clipping to occur onscreen. You do have the option to zoom out in third person on PC by holding View and moving the mousewheel, but we won‚Äôt be able to have it for first person view. 
---
As you can see they had zero intention of adding FOV sliders, basically saying we haven't done it in the past, it's hard, and oh btw, here is a workaround to change your FOV for those of you that are getting nauseous playing the game. 
---
Response 3 - Uncap FPS/Unlock FPS to physics
---
Oh hey, look at that. One heavily requested feature that people had been asking about from the start is conspicuously not even mentioned at all during their feedback response.
---
It came a couple of weeks later under immense and constant pressure from posts, articles and the like.
---
Like I said, people seem to forget easily. If you followed the situation at the time it occurred, you'll understand how VERY difficult it was to even get this post, let alone enact those features.
---
So, not drama. It's actually how it was.
---
It‚Äôs an MMO... the story is only a portion of the game. Go be a raider or protector or hermit. Try only playing with weapons that don‚Äôt need ammo. Stop fast traveling. 
---
There are so many ways to make this game fun beyond the storyline. 
---
I just saw that myself recently. Love the little things like that.
---
they weigh barely anything, the couple pounds of stash it costs is certainly worth more than the hour it would take me to find them all later :)
---
scorched have bright eyes don't they maybe its about them but thanks either way
---
That would work, yep. Me personally I did the -90% from perks and try to find armors with -weapon weight, unless I‚Äôm lucky enough to find the actual weapon with -90% reduced. There‚Äôs a few ways to go about it. All depends on how much special you have to use. 
---
Quick and painless.
---
It doesn't prevent radiation but it'll help with airborne/waterborne diseases
---
Any ideas on loot you'd want?
---
&gt;scorched have bright eyes don't they maybe its about them but thanks either way
---
 scorched have bright eyes don't they maybe its about them but thanks either way 
---
I exited through a cooling tower, jumped down into the steam and...
---
Np üòä
---
Maybe we can game this game together?
---
Well Melee weapons and armor was duped also...everything in the game been duped.. Don‚Äôt just pin it on TSE.
---
Oops meant to go to market
---
Its the only piece of head gear I've found with any DR as well, at a whopping 1
---
True. Also mothmen, Flatwoods monsters... interested to see what people come up with.
---
1. I don't know that anyone has proven the camp budget increases with level, or if that's just a popular rumor. 
---
2. If you're level 15 being attacked by high level ghouls you're in an area that you shouldn't be and need to level up before returning. 
---
3. The miscellaneous quest to retrieve lost junk doesn't always automatically turn on, you have to turn it on manually in your quest log. It also only triggers if you actually dropped junk. 
---
4. This honestly sounds like you're not suffering from bugs, more that you're not understanding the game mechanics. 
---
Im just sitting here waiting for my military paint
---
I like to think of vault dwellers best and brightest working together to rebuild. We werent all saved to massacre each other once it was over
---
Sadly seems to be the current landsape in the industry, welcome to post-2017. You can't trust either nowadays.
---
Over JUNK!? üòÅ
---
Enclave drop.
---
Dog food from spaaaaace.
---
I have been over level 100 for a long time now just stopped grinding. I have i believe everything including all prime mods. 
---
I found the content in 76 does not last you long at all. But you can make your own content up and role with it.
---
I spend most of my time with the clan Steel Rain providing help to others all day. Its probably the best fun you can have. We provide base building, power armors , weapons , armor , mods, paints and all plans and recipes gathered or donated. Mainly through the text chat mod community.
---
I highly reccomend just spending all your time helping others. I truly believe this is what they wanted us to do. To be npcs and roleplayers for others.
---
Well... I I,wouldnt calm it two years of work... More like a lazy port of fallout 4 and Skyrim assets but any way you say that as if I'm the only one. There are millions of others.
---
Pretty sure that's from Fallout 4, though in 76 it looks very similar.
---
I like this idea a lot as it‚Äôs own workshop. It would definitely be something people would fight for. All this steel I get from my camp would be more useful if I could turn it into screws. 
---
No, because that's not cosmetic. 
---
Some ammo is really heavy.  You don't have to carry all your ammo just what you need for the session.  
---
I always seem to have missles I don't remember picking up also.
---
thats the thing about radiation it makes things glow
---
lol, dind't see that :b
---
Nah, i'm french theres enough protests going on atm lol.
---
"never tell me the odds!"
---
Idk about that. Fallout 3, Fallout NV, and Skyrim kept me "Satiated" for years.
---
Other hilarious clickbait YT videos include "Bethesda losing Billions!"  "Servers are completely empty!"   "Huge Nerf! Pipe Weapons now most Powerful in game!"  "Bethesda charging monthly fee for F76!!"
---
Everything under the sun was duped but the focus is and always been TSE weapons. They were the ones selling up to 65 dollars on Ebay in their prime.
---
The height level of the camp is determined by where the little camp box is initially placed since it gives you a sphere of building space. If the box is in an elevated position to start with, you can build higher. 
---
Crazy how it came to this.  Game companies wanting to milk us dry and these youtubers pretending to lead the charge for 'consumers' just to milk the angry gamers through ads and patreon. 
---
I know right?  I'm like, who is still buying physical copies?
---
I like my Fallout the way I like my Overwatch cookies
---
**W I T H E X T R A S A L T**
---
As someone that worked at multiple retailers in my youth its actually really common for a game to get pulled to the clearance rack within 2 months of release. Source: I was the electronics dept manager at my store that was in charge of stocking the games.
---
What made the article so alarming was that they said "recall" which means the game was pulled by force by Bethesda. It could just be a poor English translation though to recall as I think the sites that were spreading this were foreign. They may have meant that stores were already getting rid of the game is clearance but translated it poorly to recall, but who knows.
---
Melee Weapons Bobbleheads and Power Armor Plans and Mods where sold in mass quantities also on eBay and other websites... just TSE has become demonized and the symbol for duping when it shouldn‚Äôt have been.
---
Usually, just the shield (physical)
---
Yeah, it's mostly Russians and Poles playing these days.
---
Mmmm, gotta be honest. Even on this subreddit the issues are blown way out of proportion. Positive posts really don't gain traction, especially as comments going against the grain in a critical post. Whatever "social media influences" they have running don't seem as interactive as elsewhere. That or there's something set up that is clearly winning, lol. And that push back just doesn't seem natural to me.
---
There is a *definite* resistance to the idea that the game is as bad as it's said to be by those invested in playing it. It's my 'personal' GOTY (don't dismiss my opinions yet plsssss :D), so I'm at least a mild authority on its ability to be fun or not. I don't bother buying/playing many games these days, and I just won't suffer bad ones, there's no time. Hell I ate shit and breathed Mass Effect for years, but passed on Andromeda. I'm decent at smelling a bad apple in a popular bunch. 
---
There is just a whole lot to celebrate with 76. The only place I don't get downvoted to literal hell about enjoying it is here, and even then, posts can have middling success depending on the days subject covering the front page with 10 identical posts. I don't think the posts that break through trying to be a ray of sunshine are manipulated, it honestly seems like a typical internet community knee-jerk reaction to the negativity surrounding it at all other times. It's hard surfing the subreddit hoping for a cool post that'll be informative or neat when you have to sift through 80% repeated suggestions and rage posts at bullies. It's to the point where new players feel they have to come to the subreddit to thank nice players giving them free stuff when they started playing as they heard the community was awful. You'd think this game is a gank fest, but I, like many, haven't ever been truly harassed by another player beyond light tiffs here and there. 
---
Definitely something wrong when a majority of new players express amazement at the fact that it's actually a great game filled with story. There's an imbalance between the social view and literal view at the moment. 
---
Shilling will happen on every side of a corporate interest. The point of a sides shilling matters quite a bit though. A company trying to manage a bit of the message board related to their new IP? Ok, I get it, not great, but ok. Malicious untruths with no other effect beyond hurting a game, often to the profit of someone in between? That's some next level stuff. Shilling to target with negativity is just an alarming and upsetting thing to deal with when you're looking for like-minded community, not controversy. 
---
This was a beautiful comparison 
---
There's a bug right now where curator will make bobbles last up to 4 hours. That's in addition to the bug that refreshes the bobble every time you log out and log back in. I have a character who's had a leadership bobble active for like 20 hours now due to the combination of these bugs. 
---
I‚Äôm only lvl 39 and mostly play lone wander. But it would be nice to group up. 
---
Can we post in r/Amish now?
---
I really don't like that guy
---
Not to mention how there's robot spawns right outside the shop, and they absolutely *love* making a beeline to Phoenix the moment you spawn in the server.
---
Phoenix needs to be kept from leaving the shop in general. No joke, I literally once found him outside the gates of Fort Defiance. He has no limits whatsoever with fleeing.
---
Everything has been duped in the masses thats not up for debate. But again TSE weapons are the poster child of dupers for a reason. No one should or can defend TSE weapons on mass to me.
---
Personally can't wait for this massive nerf to hit.
---
You started over because you lost your junk?
---
Are you not stashing anything?
---
In 4, I kept my primary rifles on the three right slots on the d-pad. I‚Äôve managed to kill the muscle memory, but many, *many* stimpacks were wasted in the first few weeks of the game as I tried to swap to my sniper/combat rifle/etc. 
---
Is there any evidence that's it's being pulled?  That's part of this rumor, that someone just made that shit up when they went to target for some Rice-a-Roni or whatever.
---
This is the 1st game I have PvP'd with so I know nothing. Being 52 years old now my reflexes are shit. I just figured I would start  PvP with players that are cool about it since it's a part of the game. It's a bit wierd in Fallout being I played them all, even the crappy original on the 1st Xbox game from Interplay. The PvP is actually fun if it's with cool players.
---
No they do not, they raise your unarmed damage by 15
---
My peak in this game was when I found out that I had 15 pounds of burned books. 
---
I'm just totally ruthless about what I carry, I don't use any weight reduction perks. 
---
Dude I seen Melee weapons selling for $75.00 a pop. Certain Armor sets I saw sell for over $1,000 dollars...TSE was selling for $5 dollars on average.
---
Depends i guess.
---
I tend to collect plans and recipes and hand them out. But i guess some people might pay 75 caps for them?.
---
I haven't tried it for ammo, but you do get 80% for food &amp; chems. Weapons are instead multiplicative, so you get a 68% reduction for 2x perk + 1x armor.
---
As long as you have the scorched earth event actively tracked there should be a timer. The only times I haven't seen the timer is when there was extreme server lag. 
---
I only use Bandolier to make my heavy guns more freely usable. Other than that no weight reduction. Once you get to a certain point in your character's progression you're going to find the weight reduction perks aren't as necessary since your stash will at that point have a good base stock of most things.
---
Most people who are having weight problems are carrying an insane kit with tons of stuff they never or rarely use. This isn't Fallout 4, this a lot more hardcore than that. Think more like it's ArmA. If you're running speed demon + carnivore you're kind of just fucking yourself super hard into needing 3 points of agility just to feed yourself. I don't really know a serious benefit of having those two mutations for a classic camping sniper. Might want to drop those mutations to free your special points from thru-hiker.
---
I know cause me and my friends At Bethesda was watching and Monitoring the situation. Most of the bans where for people selling online. The did undercover stings on Sellers on Consoles.
---
Is this more effective than living on an acid resource? I am sick and tired of having to move my CAMP just for acid :( 
---
I feel like they're only for certain people,  i.e. someone that scrapped their suit. 
---
When I picked mine up, I thought it was vault 94 or something and got stoked!
---
And don't even get me started on flamer fuel; that stuff's liquid gold. 
---
Link me to these melee weapons selling for 75 dollars and the armor sets selling for 1,000 and the TSE going for 5 dollard. I don't doubt it but i would like to see for myself.
---
Has Bethesda officially stated Mods are not a bannable offense?  I thought they were not supporting mods.  
---
You mean he retreats to ensure he can battle another day like a good soldier would?
---
Damn. I've finally got a full set of unyielding so might give it a go with the stat boost, hopefully that helps on the luck side of things.
---
Agree!
---
New Vegas was even more of a mess then three at release.  
---
Yes I had stored -- not a total newb here -- I was like 160 out of 170 lb or so -- again we are 4 months in and that's still a problem 
---
Sadly the same people who love to spread this rumor are just ignoring it, claiming it‚Äôs going to turn out to be a lie. 
---
That really says something about that kind of person. 
---
This happens to me when I‚Äôm on a team sharing that perk that magnifies mutations and the team mate leaves 
---
 It is helpful, but I suck at remembering to swap perks in and out. So I always forget.
---
Very Firewatch-adjacent! I love this pic! 
---
This game would be better with a permanent perk system closer to Fallout 4. Having to swap perks all the time just isn't fun.
---
I can't agree because that's effectively only 5 points worth of cards. I believe you should be able to have all the passive cards as passives eventually. 
---
There was something to that extent. When bans were handed out that made a statement that if you were banned for mods to contact them to be unbanned as they were only banning cheaters. Then made some statement that I‚Äôm too lazy to dig up about not banning modders which to be honest would absolutely blow up in their face since most mods just try to help make the game playable 
---
Or similar anyway 
---
Sounds good to me. 50 does feel low.
---
If I remove the card and leave team will it fix? Or am I boned?
---
Since the lever action is also a rifle type, I can put it on there too
---
Thank you for the share. I definitely went through the phone ones and shopped options. Cheers. 
---
Messaged you. 
---
Sounds tasty.  I have been using the perk that reduces rads during daytime and it is very nice
---
Faster Swing with the Martial artist perk will do more damage, and bloodied is the best build for damage. 
---
I mean, no shit.
---
I personally think the river/bridges next to Harper‚Äôs Ferry is the best for medium-level players. It‚Äôs across the map from Vault 76, so you have two free fast-travel locations on opposite sides of the map, making travel overall cheaper. There‚Äôs water, so you can place large purifiers. And it‚Äôs walking distance from the Harper‚Äôs Ferry vendor. You can also find spots with dirt, to plant gardens, and it‚Äôs cheap to fast-travel from there to both Whitesprings and Fissure Site Prime (for the Scorchqueeen).
---
So your claiming to work at Bethesda and monitoring the duping situation?.
---
u/LadyDevann can you please verify this user?.
---
Its indirectly affecting combat and i am fine with that. If you put in 260 levels you deserve a certain minor advantage and i think most would agree in the long term that is pretty minor of an advantage.
---
I do see your point though.
---
Are you on xbox?
---
That's what I thought but I tested it by keeping starched Gene's on the whole time and it still removed a mutation. 
---
Look in the stat screen shows strength +15. 
---
I don't know how many times I've had a rando run up to me and give the follow emote to find him leading me to a legendary enemy
---
Yeah, melee that was more broken to begin with
---
No it doesnt...
---
Oh sorry uh it fixed itself for me if I quit the game and reload. Also, non deleted rad-x messes with mutations 
---
it can be balanced by requiring players still have enough SPECIAL stats to support swapping to the "passive" card.  
---
So for example, so long as you have 3 perception, you could elect to make the 3 lockpick skills "paragon" skills that no longer require you to equip to use.  But if you had only 1 or 2 perception you could only have 1 or 2 lockpick skills become paragon skills.
---
dayum..i thought you could only have one mutation at a time.. so if i was trying to get more mutations..and i got one i didnt want...how do i remove the one i dont want and keep my other one?
---
Not all. Ebgames Australia pulled their stock and Amazon only had around 30 copies in stock so people thought it was going free to play. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me but it became a big thing. 
---
I don‚Äôt work I‚Äôm retired and disabled I do have friends that work at Bethesda Austin. 
---
Do you own the game?
---
I am literally looking in stat- effects screen and it says strength +15
---
I removed the card and it stayed but restarted and it went away, thanks bud.
---
Awesome thanks!  
---
I still see people on FB complaining about stuff that was fixed months ago
---
Probably not, but it is not something that would affect me negatively so I have no shits to give about it.
---
Port, yes. But it took time to design the map and do all the other game stuff (you can tell I'm knowledgeable). 
---
I'm right there with you tbh, but I cut my expectations and realized they won't be adding content for a bit. Just in time for summer I bet. 
---
I was just poking fun at the semi-outrageous request. I mean, you blew through it in 2 weeks and are expecting more? Think about those of us that bought it on launch day or pre ordered. I did the same thing! In November! 
---
I *wish* there was more replayable, engaging content, but it's just not here yet. At least you don't have to wait as long as us preorder goons :c
---
GameStop and ebgames were mentioned in the story. Primarily over seas but probably somewhat in the USA too. 
---
I don't think anyone has ever doubted that its going f2p eventually, because it definitely will given the games heavy reliance on its in game shop. The argument and concerns, were rather, that it would be way too soon. If a game is sold at launch at a full price of 60 dollars it shouldn't be going f2p for at least a year after launch. Anything sooner and its a huge middle finger to the people that bought it on day one.
---
Glad to hear it 
---
I love having folks use my workbenches etc, but please folks, close the door or all the scorched kids come in and vape everywhere...
---
Gotta wait on the taming til they fix the bug. Had a tame that never showed up to CAMP but is taking up budget space. A pretty good chunk too. 
---
yes that's true but tse allows you to use any weapon not a build specific one
---
Playing with explosives is impossible without Ordinance Express for all the dozens of grenades, molotovs, mines, 40mm grenades, missiles, and mini nukes and Bear Arms because the missile launcher and fat man weigh a fucking ton.  Because of this, I can never put my grenades or anything away in my stash as they weigh way too much without the perks.  I'm stuck with an inventory full of explosives because I can't fit any of it in my stash.
---
nope, never, we are a very exclusive club
---
 Ah good to know, thanks.  I assume this is only from when you first placed, not subsequent moving of the device?
---
As far as I can tell, it's a random chance which mutation is removed when you try to get one off. So it's hella risky. I just lucked out and got 7 that work well together. But best thing I can recommend is try and gene-therapy yourself at the pylon in the Cranberry bog with the radiation arch until you get a bunch of mutations and see what happens. I got Scaly Skin, Plaguewalker, and Twisted Muscles from that.
---
Look at your special, your not getting 15 strength...
---
the stash should be unlimited for crafting materians and around 5-8000kg for. gear. my mule store only 2-3star legendaries, amo what i dont use and around 4700kg carry currently after a 1.5month gameplay. no, nothing duped just drop of 3 star "legendary" bosses.
---
Have you actually attempted to consider what you have said yourself? Because I don't think you have. You knew that duping existed and your items were likely duped, yet continued to trade duped items after you learned about it? You couldve stopped right there, but you continued. You deserved to be banned after that.
---
Stash management 101 things that you absolutely know you need ammo creation items armor repair items keep 100 to 200 of these for ammo you might even go up higher 300 to 504 ammo related items.
---
For General Base building and just general materials keep it under 50 if you keep everything under 50 and only keep things that you know you need for what you're trying to do at about a hundred and only allow very specific items that you may need like Ammo To Go to 300 you should have plenty of room
---
With that said 600 stash space is ridiculous with junk having weight
---
There is no debuff either. The debuff only applies if you are wanted and dont have enough caps for the bounty.
---
Found Grahm stuck under the Tressel east of pleasant valley station Saturday, appears the gave the messenger bots pathing. 
---
This is an unnecessary complication to try to fix a fundamentally poorly designed leveling system.
---
All we need is for the entire perk system to be reformatted to a permanent perk system, just like Fallout 4 had.
---
The Fallout 4 system had none of the problems that the current system has, and would fix 99% of people's complaints with the current perk system.
---
I have a ghost 10% thats used up. Probably from the megasloth i tamed before i moved camps. I think if you tame a creature you loose ownership if you move but it still stays in your stored.
---
Aw man :(
---
I have a flaky internet connection, and I basically can't do workshops because of the lack of a rejoin function. There's just no point to sinking a lot of time and scrap into building it up, only to lose my connection before I get more than a couple of resource drops from it.
---
Hapens to me all the time, I just build something else, I'm not going to fight Bethesda.
---
So in a certain sense it would be like ESOs champion point system?  Not trying to say that it's a copycat of an existing idea just trying to help myself understand it a bit more. 
---
If they come begging for stuff, not help but stuff, nothing. Otherwise if they **ask** for help I usually ask if they prefer a rifle or pistol, and craft them either a modded out 10mm or combat rifle. make them a few pieces of leather armor, and however much ammo 5 crafts gets me with super duper. Pass on tips about farming ammo at the morgantown airport, crafting healing salve, and some other basic "make your life easier" tips. 
---
$5
---
Stat effects still shows it though, never said added to strength in stats. Hydraulic bracers increase unarmed damage so weapons that count as unarmed would benefit from this effect
---
Yes! Just 5 more points!
---
Really? Not 76?
---
I have the red tactical headlight for t60. So you can get it. I bought it at a vendor. I think. May have been a drop.
---
Yes when i first placed. i can move it now and it wont effect radius 
---
If you have trouble finding them look for this symbol  &gt;&gt;    That will show all the games.
---
lol i guess so
---
Great idea if you can go into the drop zone without a blue screen. 
---
 Excellent build.
---
This would be nice since im level 303
---
I saw that too! Might be a stretch, but I wonder if it's a reference to Peabody and Sherman?
---
I've got.my camp built just south of this! Mutants usually spawn here, although they're often fighting scorched (as it's right next to an unmarked fissure).
---
As u/GalaxyMan2015 said, the answer is bright eyes. And as you can see, next to the hangman is one of them monkeys, which when activated (like in fallout 4, not seen them very active in this one), their eyes light up.
---
I've always imagined that they were in the middle of a game of hangman before they got _rudely_ interrupted by the Scorched.
---
Yea but regarding height i think its better for base to start on each items foundation not box my camp had to be plaved where it is in order to cover land water and a acid node
---
*That sounds like something a synth would say!*
---
Do you know what happens if its pvp
---
A massive archive of 730M+ username/password combos was discovered on the internet.  I've seen a number of warning emails come from gaming sites in the last few days, I figured someone was trying to login using an old combo from some breach.
---
Password manager + random passwords for each different site.  It's the only way to be safe now.
---
Unbelievable, I'd never have thought to do that, thanks worked perfectly. From now on I'll just juggle the mats until it resets this bug.
---
Hello neighbor. Are you on the water closest to the station or are you further down at the pond that spawns Brahmin?
---
No debuff at all. You just die and the person who killed you gets 0 caps. 
---
Whoa...is....is that a thing?
---
üòÇ.

  Once I am tired of FO76 and need a break I plan to do a FO4 Sim Settlements play through.  It has been a year since I last played and there is so much new.  I just don't want to do so many of the quests for the 4th time.  I just want to do the settlement thing.
---
the wildcard dev of akr is not indie company.. hoewer ark just dead like fo76.
---
southeast of Top of the World you say?
---
Yup. I set up just south of West-Tek, so I can halve the travel costs of getting between the five different vendors around there, as well as the two popular nuke spots. 
---
Why did I have a 600 lb stashbox from the beginning...am I bugged? Am close to lvl 30... my camp is pretty spacious...am I doing something wrong? Or really right?
---
That is amazing. Hope someone do the same on pc.
---
How many caps ?
---
Never seen anyone do that... it does sound really funny although not for the one getting popped.
---
Yep, I'm a synth. You figured it out. 
---
Now I gotta rip your heart out of your chest like a good android. 
---
What's special about wood armor vis-a-vis the SQB?
---
Yes, would be better if you can switch without going into the cards menu... the whole perk system is just terrible. 
---
I also played it at launch... That's my point, I've been waiting patiently for,months for these vauits that should have been part of the base game.
---
Stake**
---
FTFY
---
Love it!
---
I am also running a stealth sniper build and I have none of the carry weight aiding perks, and only 6 strength...but I'm almost always a fair bit under my max weight capacity simply from pocketed gear and not hoarding everything.
---
So wait ... there‚Äôs a definite vertical limit but does that same limit apply below the camp box?
---
It's a lyric from Total Eclipse of the Heart
---
What‚Äôs it called?   Where do I find it?
---
This is awesome. Thank you for sharing with us all.
---
Thank you! Photomode rocks.
---
There are about 10 more T60 paints, but you can‚Äôt use them because reasons. 
---
Look forward to seeing a clown
---
Hadn't thought of that. That's genius! Thanks!
---
I dont like how I can carry more outside of PA. My armor pieces have deep pockets so when I hop into PA to jump off a cliff or to fight a SB, I am instantly overencumbered. 
---
Everyone here is talking about junk. Ya we get it dont horde.
---
But what about weapons? Once you find a play style your not allowed to think about using another? I use gauntlet melee weapons. I keep 4 or 5 on me so I dont have to repair every day. But if I want to carry a two shot fat man? Screw me. 
---
Now let's talk about power armor. My carry weight is +350. If I get into power armor/hazmat, I lose alot of that. Fighting the queen is allways a hassle for me because of that. 
---
They've added a cloche hat too.
---
https://i.imgur.com/oM9t9cT.png
---
I have this same issue.  I've not been able to see most atomic shop items and in game they don't render and i walk through them in a player home.  
---
I've tried reinstalling the game 2x and I've made sure everything in the folder was deleted before I reinstalled and there are currently no mods at all on mine.  
---
I've also updated my driver to most recent.  
---
Anyone got a suggestion?  I've made a ticket with bethesda but I don't expect much help from them.
---
Thanks for the tip! 
---
I've noticed that the ones with TSE's are the problem. They're constantly just stealing kills without letting others tag enemies. 
---
Ya I need some calibrated shocks.   Really not into melee build but I might be after the tse nerf.   Which makes me mad.  
---
I dont necessarily think any of this is needed if they just implement the ability to have multiple loadouts that are easy to switch.  Most of the time if you need to pick a lock you arent in the middle of combat.  By the time you are able to repair your gun you arent sitting in the middle of a super mutant horde.  Just give us the ability to have multiple loadouts and we are set.
---
I still don't see the point. I did not buy it for some bag. I wanted ma helmet and the game that was all lol. 
---
The map, pack of figures and the bag are just meh.
---
How much?
---
It is, but ive also got a wood piece for the same leg (left) and it did the same. But i guess its worth a shot 
---
I could swear there was an actual mod for it.  
---
im glad it isnt
---
First time I‚Äôm actually sad to be an Xbox peasant.
---
Id be down, we have a steady group playing. Add shaggy009
---
Pretty sure it's a perfect sphere. I've built at clifftops and been able to build on ledges quite a way below the main camp site. 
---
The problem is that whenever you gain rads you risk getting a mutation bad for your build, and there's no way to remove a specific mutation.
---
Nice!
---
The real question is... why did it even get a physical release? Outside of pre-order/collector stuff, all you're getting is an empty case and a key right?
---
The only way i know of speeding it up as of right now is with a perk. Karate Master (i know its a melee skill but bear with me) for some reason, its quickening of melee attacks also applies to the cranking speed of the gatling gun. check it out for yourself! 
---
. or even the ability to purchase space in the atom store...I'd save my atoms.
---
Hey there fellow Aussie(bum), the team is aware of this suggestion but I'll also share your thread with them. Thank you
---
Okay cool
---
yeah, not enough black hat sex boys around here!
---
Yes, just the first time. Moving the box afterwards only affects your fast travel spawn site. 
---
They could make it a lot like Xur from Destiny, have the bot available for maybe 2 or 3 consecutive days a week at a certain random location (I say 2 or 3 instead of just one day so that way people are allowed time to find it)
---
I just got nuked in the munitions factory because I took it. The guy tried to take it, died. Tried to come back and attack, died over and over. He then left for a bit and BAM! Nuke.
---
I agree but that could be dangerous. I‚Äôd be ok if it was in low increments before a lockout that was gameplay based. 
---
Agreed. I tried my hardest to keep that mutation. I think I had for 2 full sessions. 
---
To give as a gift wrapped under the tree, of course. 
---
Just a tip, if you have the registered Excavator Armor hit up Lucky Hole Mine while wearing it. In like 10-15 minutes you'll collect enough ore to make like 600 lead. No need to server hop. You'll just need a lot of acid to smelt it down.
---
People continue to ignore the bigger picture of it all and attempt to find any loophole they can. 
---
I continued to trade because hundreds of players I came in contact with enjoyed what I was doing. Legit players of high level and had never exploited, told me that exact thing. I welcomed noobs and elites, and most everyone walked away with new gear and items. I helped people build bases. I took requests for items from players so while I traded others, I'd be able to find what people I had met desired. I met tons of new people. This is how Fallout 76 was introduced to me days after I bought it. Not one person told me I should stop. Just the occasional kid that would get jealous and start blowing up my shop. I still get messages everyday from people asking for essentials and items. 
---
If everyone I came in contact in Fallout 76 was anywhere near as rude as the Fallout community on Reddit I'd seriously would have had second guessed playing the game at all.
---
Was a level 27 at uranium fever, was letting him get a tag in before I open fire so he got his legendary loot, cleaning up the rest of the molemen, and he hops in front of me and starts looting &gt;.&gt;
---
I have wanted back packs for so long. I finally got around to trading for the travelers leather coat which has a backpack cosmetic I like (not a fan of the other ones currently in the game such as the civil war one). But I have always found it silly that you would be carrying around all these miscellaneous items such as water food ammo etc and not have some kind of backpack sling or pouch. 
---
Rumor has it that in the game files there's backpack data for when the additional vaults or "raids" open up. This is very loose butt hole data that I couldn't find a lot of concrete evidence on though such as a screen shot. 
---
Dude you get 2√ó the explosive effect that is the main damage.
---
Either way you get - 75% on the TS and on TSE you get -75% on the two explosive portions and -75% on the TS its gonna be a massive nerf
---
1. Yes all the time
---
2.
---
@ lvl 20 Was up by Top of the World. When I heard some weird noise. Looked behind me in the woods and saw two eyes looking back, HUD popped up as Mothman. Made me jump. 
---
I think this is a bug, move the specific materials to your inventory from your stash and try again.
---
C'mon... That's a little funny.
---
Yes, Fullscreen is on.
---
I'll give it a search, thanks!
---
Its gonna be you existing you just choose it in menu
---
The trolling is funny, but doing it to steal materials off players with pacifist mode on (to opt out of PVP) is just gross
---
His friends totally work at Bethesda, and needed him to help monitor the duping situation. Why are you soooo suspicious?.../s. Seriously though, anyone who doesn't see an mmo flooded with duped copies of insanely OP weapons as a major issue is just silly. All everyone seems to do now is run a tse with marsupial, and jump shot everything. 
---
You‚Äôre bad
---
I got an actual disc
---
General thinking here is it is suppose to be effected by it. But until Bethesda tells us why it is not we have to assume its unintended.
---
It is very cowardly. Snakes.
---
Answer to number one, yes, we trade many things from player to player.
---
I hope so. I'm sick of seeing "kill yourself" in a game just because I played poorly. Like shit man I'm sorry I played poorly and we lost, but telling me to kill myself, really? Would you ever say that to a person's face? If the answer is yes then you're a psychopath, but the answer is no for most people.
---
I get most of my legendary gear off vendors in wattoga or white springs. Stuff players sell to the vendors 
---
Ok this is hilarious and I wish you were on PC!
---
Right, I was rifleman with TSE but now I'm starting to learn I need to change up my armor. I'm gonna have to get a Cavaliers set...
---
Then people would be complaining about "griefers" stealing their stuff. 
---
 Yes its a bug. If you put it all in your stash it will work. If you have it on you it will work, otherwise it won't.
---
Welp... I know what I‚Äôm doing tomorrow!!
---
That is thinking outside the box !
---
Why is it when someone disagrees with someone they're automatically toxic?  Just because he doesn't share your idea?  Not letting other people have their own opinion is toxic.
---
What is usually the most coveted items? I try trading to players but I guess they dont want what I'm selling 
---
Dont think its a sphere more like just a circle with limited vertical height dont think it effects whats below aslong as its in the radius
---
The Rad Worms made me laugh :)
---
I feel like a dipship for forgetting this thread existed... I'm extremely sorry for not saying a word.
---
You don't happen to play on PC, do you? Then we could, I don't know, throw a nuke somewhere or chat at some point.
---
(Schreibe das jetzt in Englisch da ich nicht wei√ü ob Deutsch in diesem Thread erlaubt ist xD)
---
Dude you should recruit. 4 different killers stalling the wasteland. Sounds like fun.
---
You‚Äôre a joy at parties huh
---
I quit playing a month ago cause my Stash and inventory are maxed. That‚Äôs not my essential fallout experience. I want to LOOT and store pretty much every gun/outfit. I can‚Äôt in this game. The limitations on weight have turned me off beyond mundane enjoyment. Oh well. I‚Äôll try it again in a year. 
---
Thanks for that mate
---
Yeah i am but no harm in asking Devann to verify this crazy story lol.
---
But yes your are right and it bugs me when people try to defend them. All i see is people who most likely paid real money for them.
---
Get all types on Reddit.
---
Yeah if you can manage the weight then it would be nice to carry around both sets
---
No ones forcing people to leave good gear in there, i wouldnt mind the chance to offload some of the stuff i am keeping for friends from my stash. If it gets raided well thats life after the bomb !
---
Well if it‚Äôs not going free to play then can they remove the overprice MTX?! The fuck. 
---
This is the number one thing that keeps me from playing. It's obnoxious to almost always be overencumbered and have to deal with weight and stash limits. I booted it up for the first time in a while and 30 minutes in I felt like it was more of a chore and put the game down.
---
Probably happens with a lot of games these days. Gotta overshoot for new title displays on top of the decline of brick and mortar seeming worse every major release with how much is pre-downloaded/patched.
---
If there wasn't buyback in the age of digital console stores and amazon, brick and mortar would be constantly gambling on how much supply to buy, and would always fall short if they undershot demand for an unforeseen hit.
---
Simple economics for keeping the base level sales model consistent and supplied.
---
I haven't walked in a Gamestop since... Shit... I think I pre-ordered the Mass Effect 3 collector tin game case edition. So many years. I'm likely still as much of a financial asset to the industry as ever though.
---
Not saying its sales were "actually great!" or anything. Just saying its probably not something to get concerned about or to extrapolate from.
---
Hey cashiimo, going to let the team know about this. Thank you for taking the time to tag us and let us know. It would also be great if you could submit a support ticket and select the category "feedback"
---
2. No idea, currently lvl 285
---
3. No all effects like chamelion etc are only on legendary dropped items. You can however craft mods on said legendary items like buttressed or polymer for armors and general upgrades to make weaponry more gooders
---
4.Hell No, Energy weapons suck right now, i have an explosive tesla rifle and its best use is farming whitesprings as it gets a lot of aoe from the explosive effect but it is minimally damaging so that everyone participating in the farm can get a hit on all ghouls and share in the xp and items and no one being an inconsiderate douch and one shotting everything with a duped tse.
---
Good luck in the wasteland üëç
---
So, what you're saying is, if I were to hand you a bag of counterfeit bills which you then proceeded to distribute to people who "enjoyed" it, then got arrested, you'd claim innocence too? 
---
What if someone told you to jump off a cliff because they'd enjoy it? Would you do that as well?
---
People enjoying you cheating is not an excuse. You knew what you were doing was wrong. You continued to do it and got caught. There's no loopholes here and I'm sorry that you find the truth being told to you as people being "rude". It's a very ignorant way to look at this situation. Stop fishing for excuses and accept that you knowingly continued to cheat, and face the consequences.
---
Just ran in and grabbed it. Level 12 when I realized I shouldnt be there. Or that you should put a camp there. I was helping a lost robot find the person it was made to deliver a note to. Took me there. Saw I was close to that sword I had abandoned going to. I imagine a crew had just picked most the ghouls clean because besides the few that spawned to attack the robot. Getting to the sword was clear.  Until some high level charred chunky boys showed up and I ran away to the end of some greens and built a small camp. Waited to get level 20+ before really finishing the rest. Good Luck! 
---
ran into a vengeful one in the mire last night on my second character. i was turning my camera saw it(eyes were orange like those orange plants everywhere) and it instantly rushed towards me and i sidestepped it, turning my camera to see where it went behind me and it shot up into the air like a rocket
---
A PC player by any chance? If so maybe we could team up sometime (or just fill the friend list a bit if you're a lone wanderer)
---
Und sorry f√ºr's nicht antworten, ich scheine den Post komplett verdaddelt zu haben...
---
Or a sloth 
---
What's a tse? 
---
yep I dump everything into stash -- it's not a concern on when \ how often I store -- it's more along the lines of 2 things -- 1 ) I shouldn't have my stuff in the middle of the Earth -- 
---
SteviMay may regret that later that is *buhdumtiss*
---
Mid 50‚Äôs melee tank. Hunted down and ate the inhabitants.
---
Welcome to last month everyone!
---
Carnivore with cannibal = never carrying food again
---
it can teleport i believe
---
yes, it was. it's my impression that it's a server issue. for example:
---
on the client-side, you accidentally hit E to open a container up and then tab to close it, followed by R to reload your weapon.
---
on the server-side, the packet for the initial E press is lost, so all it sees is you pressing alt to bring your pipboy up and then R to drop whatever is highlighted.
---
if I'm right, then binding drop to another key might help. or preferably a mod to "lock" items, kinda like quest items. you can't move the veil of secrets for example.
---
While I'll give you credit for reading through the article, there remains an issue: Polygon is not a reliable source. They're biased towards political correctness, they like to virtue-signal, and they are not above printing half-truths or outright misinformation.
---
Now, depending on how you feel about the fellow, you might find this recommendation either off-putting or interesting, but regardless, I'd suggest you check out Count Dankula's [research-backed commentary on the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F1g83R7EGI), as a near polar-opposite counterpoint to Polygon's article.
---
Even if you doubt elements of his perspective, I think you'll find yourself also looking back at the Polygon article with doubt.
---
As an aside: I'm basically suggesting that you do what I did. I read the Polygon article, then I went off and looked for someone with the opposite opinion, and compared the two perspectives to see what agreed and what differed, and also to look for either dishonesty or simple negligence in fact-gathering.
---
I‚Äôve just learned to live with being over encumbered. It means walking everywhere, but the scenery is so beautiful. Plus you run into all sorts of quests.
---
Huh, guess I've just never found the plans or never noticed.
---
F your stash increase and weight limit increases. You‚Äôre playing wrong if you‚Äôre overloaded. I hope beggars continue to be ignored by devs.
---
Been playing since launch and haven‚Äôt had any issues. I‚Äôd try an alt next f you‚Äôre about be the count and see if one from that will pop it
---
Lol sorry, it a two shot explosive legendary weapon, usually a shotgun or a handmade rifle. The choice of the Noob Terrorising douche bag
---
I was agreeing with your skepticism. His comment was the fallout equivalent of the kid in middle school with the hot model girlfriend, who lives in Canada
---
With Copperhead road playing in the background, growing up in rural Kentucky this song made you proud to be white trash. https://youtu.be/xvaEJzoaYZk
---
I found a star cloaking robot arm on a vendor, that's the one that makes you poof when hit.
---
The other two stars were increased sweet spot on lockpicking and making you harder to see when sneaking....
---
Hey, you're back! Haha.
---
This is beginning to make me laugh more than anything. You've said you'd leave twice now. You've repeated yourself well enough.
---
You can buy them from the MODUS medical terminal. 
---
I applaud his effort in seeking revenge. 
---
5 likely possibilities 
---
There's healing factor for large health regen
---
There's regenerating legendary armor pieces
---
There's the endurance perk Homebody for regen in your camp
---
There's the endurance perk Ghoulish for hp regen in rads 
---
There's the endurance perk Photosynthetic for regen between 6 am and 6 PM
---
Most likely, it's one of those that's causing it 
---
Were they wanted? Mutations can trigger PvP if so.
---
Otherwise, most likely bobblehead glitchers. 
---
Yeah ahahah seems about right.
---
Let the man sleep, do you know how hard for us raiders to practice our lines on if you like seeing your own blood, or calling you rookies. Plus pool cue clubbing is a serious workout, do you know how hard you have to swing to crack open a power armor? 
---
Are you a fellow PC master racer? If yes: Wanna team up/chat sometime? Or fill up your friend list with a random stranger you met on Reddit? xD
---
Sorry f√ºr die "etwas" versp√§tete Antwort, ich scheine den Thread voll vergessen zu haben...
---
So there's nothing to be gained from it? You don't get junk or anything?
---
Sadly no. It only affects your held inventory items. 
---
Nice, will have to grab them.
---
They said it would increase in time.
---
We just have to wait till they feel they can.
---
Yeah whats the point of locking doors if they cant steal anything
---
They are going free to play, it's just a matter of time. They need to milk out those last few bucks during the first quarter of the new year before they pivot in the second quarter to a micro-transaction only system.
---
That would go against their stance that the Atomic Store would only be cosmetic. 
---
Which is essentially just your key.
---
This if someone has a bounty they can do whats called a mutation check. If you have them you will ping them so then they can freely kill you. Its scummy as hell but its for them to wrack kills up from those who don't want to pvp.
---
Otherwise yeah probably a bobby.
---
I'll add you tomorrow if you're still interested, maybe some time we can nuke a place or something :D
---
Sorry, dass die Antwort 11 Tage gebraucht hat, diesen Thread hatte ich voll verplant...
---
They take stat bonuses away not your ability to assign stat cards, so marsupial will cause you to craft worse gear but never take your cards away
---
how exactly does going FREE-to-play increase the revenue they get from the game?
---
Crafting gear and learning mods from salvaging faster
---
Not wanted. I figured they stacked bobbleheads since their explosive shotguns killed me in one hit. Just wondering if the game can't handle slap/murder. Didnt flag them at all. Last 150 caps each time. I'd appreciate it atleast flag them for a murder bounty.  No mutations in affect. 
---
Depends what the weapon is really. What legendary effect/s it has etc. A cultists blade may not seem very intimidating to power armor clad tse wielding player. But if the knife has 50% armor penetration, 50% + dmg on power attack and 40% faster swing speed then your fucked really arent you. Or perhaps any two of the above and 50% limb damage then the first strike will cripple you making it harder to move or slower to target your weapon etc and then another or perhaps two more strikes and you ded. 
---
I enjoy the game, but wish there was a warning when the enemies are about to jump because of a higher level player. Wasted all my stimpacks and most of my ammo, as well as broke 4 of my 5 armor pieces ‚Äòcause the supermutants I was fighting jumped from 15 to 65 (as well as the fact that the new high level mutants literally fell from the sky)
---
Were you in a team?
---
it is free to play  
---
just not free to own
---
Solo
---
The point is he did not understand how it works.... so there was no point
---
There is a note in the church in Grafton. It‚Äôs written by a ghoul inviting the non ferals to join him and move east.
---
Won't launch without it
---
The salt levels exceed expectations however he still failed with the sharing of lvl 3 rad sponge
---
I am guessing alot of us are in simular spots. Best thing to do is dedicate your time to helping others. I believe they have heaps of pvp content comming out soon. Then a vault dungeon opening shortly as well.
---
I've started using bobbleheads recentely and found out that bug. It will be patched soon I guess.
---
No he‚Äôs a pretty big racist. He‚Äôs a fucking GamerGater dude.
---
Hell yeah brother ! Sweat baby barbeque üòÜ
---
Didn‚Äôt perks effect it in previous games or no?
---
It wouldn't be such a problem of they would increase the stash size to at least 1000 so we could store stuff we are all lugging around unnecessarily.
---
hope someone puts it in a container...lol
---
seriously i just got it and 2 other plans yesterday on my second character, thx whoever did that on ps4.
---
When I was big into arma, we were in a chopper doing some missions and our damn pilot falls asleep. We didnt make it
---
Get fireproof full rank and a good melee weapon. You can take at least one or two shots then close the distance and negate their advantage as if they fire on you the aoe explosive damage will kill them too
---
Which is what a key does.
---
I'm not even really sure why theres a limit on the stash,  or why building more storage containers doesnt add to your stash. Seems to me that if I build more containers, my stash limit should increase.
---
Not defending duping..,I‚Äôm only pointing out TSE where not the only duped items.
---
Not sure i can't remember but it needs to here where weight is more important than most things.
---
Are those craftable?
---
* waits for non broken toilet and tub as well as better stairs*
---
Remember this game balances PVP with the PVE.
---
Do you enjoy being unloaded upon by people now?
---
Imagine with permanent perks.
---
The stills have containers attached, but I've never found anything in them. I think this was probably going to be an event that got scrapped. Hopefully they'll make it happen in the future.
---
So you compared 3 single player games with full mod support to a multiplayer survival game with no official mod support?
---
And if she wants to contact me and ask questions I have no issues on being Vetted.
---
I find myself in my inventory for more than 60% of my game play everyday. It's tedious. They need to find new ways keep us playing and less time babying our character. I play games to have fun, not to be a constant babysitter. I feel like I only keep playing this game because I need to get my money's worth. If I got it for free I would have stopped playing long ago
---
Typically if you see someone in the wild you probably won't trade. A lot of people use Reddit / Discord to set up trades
---
I feel you my friend.
---
The problem is that the lack of dailies (which just won't freaking pop up, thanks Todd) and the buggy events I start to get bored and annoyed by this game every time but because I'm a completionist I want to get EVERYTHING (except for the 7.6k hours, that's just bull), even started my own Excel lists so I can keep track of my progress 'n shit.
---
But Bethesda has to add something new except bugs, nerfs and bugs, the core game is just not enough anymore, it's just a grindfest for things we can't even keep anymore since the stash limit is still only 600...
---
I like that you're being downvoted even though it's true.
---
Camp storage to build more things -- I was able to store 600 but I could never increase my base to add new crops or defenses -- it stayed the same -- 
---
Based on.......?
---
A vetted source is a reliable source.
---
someone please tag a Bethesda employee here, this needs to be official 
---
Haven't played that but if it works!
---
The little monkey toy there has bright eyes
---
what terrible about 76?
---
You can re get the mission to pick up loot. Next time you die with some junk, go to the data tab and select "retrieve your loot". That should fix it until next time you cant get you loot due to a server drop.
---
And I don‚Äôt have a problem with that
---
I agree. Would be nice if we could just max out all our perks and let special be what makes us different, but i feel like they have a different vision in mind for later on in the game.
---
I'm always dropping stuff to low levels (helps me get rid of weight haha) I have WAY too many stimpacks to handle. 
---
I love micromanaging my inventory, though even i admit at times it can become tedious. 
---
However, i've managed to put together a build i'm happy with. I use a 15 perception build with all the Rifleman perks amd Tank Killer, and have 6 Agility with Action Boy and Thru hiker. Also travelling pharmacy AND junk rat. The alloted points add up but on the bright side i'm dealing a lot of damage still so it's kinda working.
---
With 10 points on strength i use also Gladiator/Slugger maxed with expert and master on level 1. My other combat focus is explosives, maxed Demo expert and Grenadier. I'd suggest Tormentor too, if you're going to use rifles. 
---
Interesting take. Better than the current system lol.
---
Interesting, it seems to be related to high-populated areas. Whitesprings, Watoga, etc. Currently it's pretty unplayable for me, as my Camp is nearby Whitesprings..So the moment I load, I crash in 5 minutes. UNLESS I teleport away from where I want to go...
---
I liked it. It's not the language that matters, it's the journey. ;)
---
Heck, most of grahm's plans are rare enough, you have a duplicate by accident, post it here on reddit and make at least your caps back if not a profit.
---
I presume they stock games on disk in stores so Grandma can buy the Fallout 76 game, wrap it up with colourful paper and put a bow tie on it and give it to little Johnny and a surprise for Christmas.
---
Christmas is over and the excess Christmas presents are being put away. Regular gamers buy their games from online stores. 
---
Fallout 76 may one day be free to play, but not today.
---
I saw a smaller unmarked church nearby with a tunnel and there is a collapsed part to the church so maybe there is a tunnel under this one that will be in one of the expansions.
---
I got to level 17 as a non-automatic rifle spec and then started over.  The pain of trying to have enough ammo and constantly breaking weapons was not fun.
---
I rerolled as 2H melee (sharp sledgehammer then super sledge with heating coil at 30) and never looked back. I oneshot at least half the mobs and can tank 3-4 mobs at once using heavy leather armor. 
---
I still use a 308 for sniping at a distance when I don‚Äôt want to run over there or for pulling the mobs towards me. Then I switch to 45 combat rifle while the get closer. Then I finally change to sledge when they are in my face.  
---
If I go into a building I only use a my 2H. I don‚Äôt carry anything any other weapons. I don‚Äôt bother with grenades or mines or pistols. I don‚Äôt even pick them up. 
---
Pro tip: your looting priority is adhesive and ballistic fiber.  Get as much as you can. You will never have enough of either until you hit 50. 
---
I don‚Äôt bother with power armor outside of nuke zones. Not really needed. 
---
Oh i whole heartedly agree. I very much dislike what they did with the system. They will definitely make changes to it, they said before release they are going to change the game based on player feedback.
---
Well there‚Äôs no such thing as 1 shotting people from stacked bobble heads but did you have a workshop by chance?
---
Cranberry bog, the place with one city and an infinite amount of trenches that annoy you while getting attack spammed by scorchbeasts.
---
Interested 
---
Had a workshop. No where near it at the time. 
---
Lots of people have complained about the PVP system in this game. Personally, I think separating PVE and PVP servers might work. Alternatively, the perk cards could be balanced differently against players as they are against NPC enemies. Some other online games do this.
---
I do, level 85 on one character. 
---
Pretty much... I had to scrap my 20lb legendary lvl50 Vampires Grognak Axe the other day.... I wanted to role play with it... but stash limit. I cry. 
---
I don't disagree. Multiple sets would be a good temporary fix. I'm hoping for more complexity to the game later down the road is all.
---
You know what they," good is fine and dandy but great is a handjob from  Marilyn Monroe" - some guy i just made up probably
---
Oohh!  I'll likely never end up on your server but I want to do this
---
I was planning to use a shotgun agains some tough minion spawsn but it was not needed haha.
---
F76 is a fun game, but the exploits, duping and total lack of meaningful end game are putting this game's future in serious jeopardy right now.  If I had to guess, I would estimate that over 75% of people who bought the game aren't playing any more.
---
Well you can always hunt the young ones I find that fun..made a trap base 2 versions and kill least 2 a night often more..I‚Äôm slowly racking up kills and I‚Äôll be the more prolific serial killer bwahah 
---
Savage Divide got it's name from being raider infested, and in its heyday it *would* have been perilous to cross with the raider outposts everywhere. 
---
Toxic Valley is for low level players leaving the Forest for the first time so it makes sense that it's not *that* dangerous, its just gross looking and covered in industrial pollution. Jumping in the toxic water will increase your rads pretty quick. 
---
I quite like the Mire. Discovering the Mire the first time was awesome, its beautiful. 
---
You sound like Commie scum! 
---
I remember that. I just blocked them fully and continued on for a little until the server went down. Just trying to understand how the game mechanics worked. 
---
No mutations 
---
No bounty 
---
Had a workshop but wasnt near it
---
Both times it only took one shot 
---
Still no bounty? That's what I dont understand. 
---
They were both sneaking and I hadn't even fired a shot yet. Just weird. 
---
Take a break from the grind and wait for the next content drop.
---
I kept trying to place the Decon Shower on my ground floor, each time I placed it, it would jump up to the same location on the floor above. I have no idea why it did this, but eventually, I played the design to this and found a good spot on my second floor for it. Fortunately, my design uses the second floor as the main floor.
---
Vendor plans are per login. you can re login to any server( or even the same) to get different plans.
---
Well there ya go. If you have a workshop you‚Äôre opening yourself up to pvp anywhere on the map. Someone can go to claim it and then fast travel to you and kill you. Best to never take a workshop unless you‚Äôre ok with at least the remote possibility of being PK‚Äôd
---
The bigger picture is that your actions have negatively affected the game economy and many other players. I only see you looking for loopholes with these excuses you are trying to use. It's astounding to see that you believe just because people liked you cheating (and yes, you cheated. You traded glitched items while you knew they were glitched. Stop it with the ignorant excuses already), you should be excused from consequences.
---
Just because you don't agree with the truth, it doesn't make it rude for people to tell it to you.
---
There's a pair of lakes just west of Johnson's Acre on the south border of the map. The western of the two has a nice cliff to back your camp against for defense and all I've seen there is an occasional mole rat or other leveled yet minor animal
---
Same boat.
---
They need to add more content. 
---
After 85 levels you feel the summation of your experience has the worth of a free to play game?
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs gonna be shut down in a year, this game is gonna be a money sink for besthedia with no long term player base
---
Based on.....?
---
Which would be worse, disliking them or not visting them period.  https://youtu.be/SlKao_Pox5A
---
Ok, didnt see anything about my workshop being taken, but could have missed that. So all they have to do is take the workshop or start to then they can kill me? I should have gotten a reclaim workshop mission though, right?
---
You do realize fallout was built around collecting things? Kinda hard to do with the small stash size...
---
Is this your screw? You dropped it back there.
---
If we can mod deathclaw mounts, I am in.
---
I was having a lot of fun with fallout 76 but I literally had to stop playing because I realized 75% of my time was going into making sure my carry weight was sufficient. I‚Äôm shocked Bethesda hasn‚Äôt patched it to be much higher yet  
---
When you say everything in the folder was deleted, do you mean just one folder?
---
There are two places you'd need to wipe in order to have a truly clean slate:
---
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Launcher\games\Fallout76
---
    C:\Users\&lt;yournamehere&gt;\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76
---
If you _have_ wiped both of those, then I'm not sure what else to suggest. They are the only two places I'm aware of.
---
Nope. 600 limit stash can't make a good trader
---
That's the most Yee to the haw I've ever heard 
---
Oh, you mean a movement that started because Zoe and her sketchy actions.
---
A Grognak RP or more like a Cito ancestor RP?
---
(And here I am waiting patiently for my Silver Shroud costume... someday...)
---
THIS is what I was expecting from all of the people wanting to "roleplay a trader".
---
Where's my traders teleporting a location away or two, then pretending to happen by me while going walking speed asking if I'd like to see their wares.
---
Fallout 4s most successful vendors were the traveling traders! Trashcan Carla must've been *running* the Commonwealth trade system with her coverage. Damn Institute spy...
---
Yup
---
No rumors no bull. just straight to the point facts
---
Yeah I agree that player-development wise Toxic Valley made sense. But I definitely would of preferred if they changed the map layout more. Maybe make the natural progression go down to Ash Heap, then if you want to cross you must either brave the perilous journey across the Savage Divide, or if you want, the toxic wastes of the Toxic Valley. I think the Mire is fine as a pre-bog region, but the most important part for me is how lackluster and disappointing the Bog is. It almost ruins the other regions because there‚Äôs a buildup to basically nothing.
---
You spawn in the forest, a tame green place. You explore the Savage Divide, a region with a treacherous history. The Ash Heap, a region of destruction and ruin. The Toxic Valley, also destruction and ruin. Then the Mire, a terrifying place with the most horrifying creatures. What could possibly lay in the Cranberry Bog you ask? What could be worse than massive Hermit Crabs, Anglers, Deathclaws, and Wendigos? Oh wait. It‚Äôs just Scorchbeasts who were used as a primary enemy in the Mire along with Scorched, and some robots in a city. That‚Äôs it. And the environment is lame too. Boo.
---
So what leads you to believe they were dupers?
---
I can't believe someone actually downvoted you for posting the truth and facts 
---
check nukacrypt
---
Actually the bigger picture is that the game was broken with a broken economy to begin with. That is the biggest picture of Fallout 76. The fact still stands that I have never duplicated and have never exploited. I didn't break any rules in both the rules of conduct or terms of conditions. Many have attempted to be cruel and spiteful, and at the end try to back their statements with logic once I state my point and how well grounded it is. It doesn't work when what you all claim is false and misjudged. I didn't negatively affect the games economy, I made it fair and fun. I was told that every time I logged on and began trading with people.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what happened. Dude moseyed up to my camp, gave his little pitch, and asked about the weather. It was incredible.
---
 Really?  I never spawn anywhere near mine for some reason.  
---
He diddnt look and sound like The Vault Tec Rep, did he?
---
And the holo tape clicks off..
---
This is awesome, I love that your giving people an a 'slasher' experience, but keeping it super fair as well. I'm currently playing on Xbox, but have to admit I'm pretty tempted to start a PS4 character just to have a go. 
---
.............was this on xbox?
---
Good point!!
---
I do. With the effort (or obvious lack there of) put into this game. The lack of innovation or change in a 15 year old engine rather than making a new one or using some of the much better ones available. The inability to even fix simple bugs fixed for you by the community, and the ovaral 10 person dev team feel (I obviously know it's a lot more than that) several months after release even though they've been documented and reported. The lack of dev involvement post launch. The lack of end game content, including the vaults that are scattered around and never have had anything released about them and they obviously aren't accessible.
---
All of that combined says yes, it does gave the worth of a free to play game. Especially since the lack of sales show this isn't worth full game price, and they make, or can make enough money to support the non-existant post-launch development.
---
To me that makes more sense than having to equip and unequip lockpick/hacking perks. Perks like gun nut do t bother me because of the durability bonus.
---
Who ever thought it was going free to play are idiots
---
Irl you probably wouldn't live in a vault and fight mutated enemies either though?
---
Lucky its not a simulation I guess.
---
I built my camp, on stilts (farm underneath) UNDER and overpass. I still get raindrops. 
---
Thatch my ass! Lmao
---
Great description. One thst one can follow
---
Yeah same here. Hit 71 today. Really not much to do now. But I'm playing on PS4 and I'm slowly trying to grind to lvl 100 to get the platinum. Its the last trophy I need to get it. 
---
 If a player steps on a mine does that give you wanted status?
---
Juicehead was always an obnoxious clickbait chaser.
---
Damn that's cool!.  
---
social media was a mistaaaaake.
---
They griefed him; whoever wrongs you ingame is by definition a duper. /s
---
As of right now, they have bugs, issues and whatnot. All they will need in theory is to have the capacity for as many F2P players they would get on the servers. Once they have them, those players will start (albeit slowly) purchasing atomic shop items, the shop will get even more monetized and new items will appear more frequently, then the F2P market will increase the revenue from the atomic shop alone.
---
Now, if those same F2P players are put at a slight disadvantage to us who paid full price (e.g., smaller stash size, perhaps nerfed CAMP budget, etc.) then some of them may pay the $30 for full access. That would also lure in more money for a game which will already have made the most money from the initial purchases made of this game.
---
Literally any measure Bethesda takes to make money now is literally icing on the cake for them. The meat and potatoes are probably finished in their eyes as far as work is concerned.
---
for sure agreed
---
Chris Hanson would like a word
---
It's changes the spawn point relative to the box, I kept spawning at the bottom of a cliff at my last camp so I moved the box to the far back of the green zone and it moved my spawn point. 
---
Phoenix wins every time...
---
Aw dang, thanks! I'll add it to the main post when I can and credit you.  Im away from my PC now :'(
---
an official statement on something you should know was complete nonsense.
---
Ya see, I hate when people dont drop nukes and expect everyone to drop it where they want it. 
---
Sometimes, if someone is taking too long in a silo, I will run through, take the targeting computer and drop it somewhere random too.
---
 How do you craft more?
---
Yes wanted status no more than 2 out at a time and when you leave the server 
---
Literally in the same spot except 10 levels under you.
---
I have my camp on a nice little peninsula in the forest. Between farming the GM and tagging acid for collection I can usually keep up. 
---
Guess who cares?
---
I spotted one sneaking through the woods that didn‚Äôt see me.  Thought I‚Äôd get the jump on him and fired once while still hidden.  He completely disappeared never to be seen again.
---
Okay that‚Äôs honestly hilarious.
---
  Come back when they launch DLC.  You got a lot of hours out of this game, enjoy something else for a while and come back later when there is new fun stuff.
---
It's not that unstable or dangerous, I mean, unless you're the type that smokes while you pump gas you'd be fine. But a mission to gather spoiled fruit and wood and purified water and some moonshine jugs and then protect the stills from yao guai or something would be cool. Get some mountain honey as a reward... mmm.
---
I will have to check this out. Thanks.
---
Ah yes, i have run into exactly 1 of these and im honestly glad. I faced her in an open field. I think it's the first time i had to chain stimpacks together. My anti armour deathclaw gauntlet after i popped my fury was at 550, when i went to go hit her it was almost like i was doing slap damage. That queen is the harbinger of death. 
---
I always hear people complaining about how Whitesprings is always nuked and would want something new. I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôre not one of them.
---
Just rename him Chuck Norris already.
---
On PC, can confirm like the other poster that I have a buddy that only played beta and sometimes when I first login I see him online. I get really excited for a minute only to realize he's not on. Usually corrects itself within a few seconds. Social in general is super bugged. Sometimes after I add a friend I have to close to desktop to be able to see them. Wish they would get that shit worked out.
---
the task is there but when you go to the marker it's below the playing level -- there is no bag -
---
when the game came out, I assumed the weight limit was a gameplay feature to encourage trading and discourage hoarding.
---
After playing for a while (I'm around lvl60 now), I noticed that player trading is nearly absent from the core experience and hoarding is not only intended but required.
---
Once the stash limit was increased with the caveat from devs that, "we'll see how it affects performance," as well as the crashes and slowdowns from chronic duping, I now realize I was giving this game too much credit... the stash limit isn't a gameplay feature, it's a technical limitation. too many items crash the server.  
---
I'm right there with everyone complaining that booting this game up is almost always a hesitant, cringey experience because of the stash limit and its resulting necessities of inventory slashing and repackaging. I'm now in the habit of just taking extra time at the end of every play session to deal with this nonsense instead of inflicting it on myself later. 
---
I was sort of trained into this in Fallout 4 Survival mode because you couldn't save or fast travel, every play session ended with crawling back to a settlement to drop off shit and go to bed. I could not have anticipated how much *more* frustrating it is when there's just NO PLACE TO PUT STUFF DOWN without losing it forever when you log out. I was really proud of my legendary collections in fo4 and put them all up on the fort armory walls. There's nothing like that going on with my f76 character. He has some weapons on him and a stash full to the brim with junk. It cheapens the whole experience when you can't even keep the stuff you earn.
---
That was awesome!!!
---
Ah okay. I wasn't sure if the shotgun perks might apply in some way to the combat rifle. :) That sort of thing happens with some stuff.
---
only reason for an alt is to get level capped plans
---
Yea they can just click claim and not actually stick around to claim it. They can purposefully let it fail but pvp has already been initiated. Also you don‚Äôt get a retake event when another player takes the workshop.
---
Destroy the base every time... leave server  and find some random to claim the bounty
---
No because they travel while the claiming circle is open. This is the primary way to grief someone.
---
If they start attacking my camp, they also start pvp with me, right? So mines will trigger I think.
---
Some perks should have just been mandatory passive skills when we leveled up
---
I have pacifist mode on and was not aware of that. I usually stay away from other players when they're firing. But I'll be more cautious now in big fights just in case. 
---
I'm so sick of whitesprings. But unfortunately 97% of everywhere else completely sucks to nuke.
---
HORRAY forward thinking Bethseda. Let's have 2 viable nuke spots. That will for sure work untill we put out a patch in 6 months for new constant and/or nuke zone upgrades. 
---
Jokes on you though, I cant kill myself with my own explosive weapons due to perks and armor setup
---
9 charisma, and Hard Bargain 3 had it at ~19.4k caps. 
---
I‚Äôd say unless your stashing away legendarios les three staying under the limit shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. I understand having to get around the hoarding junk items for crafting mentality can be hard, as it was for me too, but once you get around that it‚Äôs not too terribly tough. 
---
Shoot, I only just got home.  If you want to add me, my Beth account is the same screen name as this one.
---
Same as here: JaydenWindsong.
---
Seems to be the general thought process around here these days, lol. 
---
I think they are at Dolly Sods? They are behind a lvl 2 locked door on the second floor.
---
If I was broke that‚Äôd be fine to me. I hate pvp so a pvp debuff isn‚Äôt bad to me
---
Always seen it on my chem station under explosive next time I‚Äôm on I‚Äôll tell what the ingredients are
---
Have you ever tried fighting a Scorched Mirelurk Queen?
---
That ho gave me PTWSD before I could even spell it ffs.
---
Yea those do hurt. Falling in a fissure will always do that, and there is a spot in the powerplants with water that is too deep to get out of even with marsupial. Or just dying in a stream. Loosing junk really is just part of the game. But really it takes 15 min to gather 600lbs of junk so not a big deal in a game I have 200+ hours in.
---
Then play a game that isn't poorly designed. 
---
Ah, alright. 
---
 Way over there! Mine is on the cliffs to the west of Watoga and sometimes they go off all day long. ;)
---
Ok, I got it now. Thanks for the info
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I consume 10x my recommended salt intake on soup every in-game day.  But hey, I get my veggies and fruits.
---
I‚Äôve been attacked at my camp by him once before and I wasn‚Äôt wanted. Also was 1 shotted from full health? Whatever that‚Äôs about since I‚Äôm pretty beefy.
---
Are you suggesting I cook the dog alive? That seems unnecessarily cruel.
---
I was mostly worried about plans in the world since getting some every few hours beats hundreds of server hops.
---
So if I loot some power armor with my main it won't be there for an alt for the normal respawn time?
---
I have my 76 installed in a custom folder on a separate drive I use for games. So that covers the games file for the launcher.
---
I didn't know about the other folder and it has ini files in it....
---
Thank you very much this might be my problem. Will report again soon
---
Don't worry, there's no need to credit me.
---
$4 for a photomode pose. Pass.
---
Me too.
---
Cool.  I don't do much with the chem station and am not an explosive guy, so I am sure i missed it.
---
Quite interesting, I've taken a different approach by dressing up as the guy from "The Strangers". Basically leaving little presents for people as I break into their homes. Nothing marsupial and an open window can't stop me from getting past a locked door.
---
 I guess I was thinking if they had not yet attacked you camp and triggered a mine.  That raises the question do no hostile players trigger mines?  
---
This kinda post is becoming more and more common. I myself have exhausted my time on 76. I‚Äôve since just put the game on hold and went back to FO4. I‚Äôll eventually come back when there‚Äôs at least 2 major DLCs.
---
I agree about the CB. I guess they wanted to focus on the SB as the prime enemy, the cause of destruction for all Appalachia. In reality, they're just the same enemy we all know and hate. I think the Mire is the better high-level region. I feel far more endangered from multiple fog crawlers, mirelurks (kings and queens especially) and gulpers than a lone scorchbeast. Visually it's more interesting too. 
---
Ah, good, then I'm optimistic you'll have a good result. :)
---
Johnny 5 is alive!!
---
Its unsolved
---
That may be the fact but it remains that you should always be prepared to lose junk you carry on your person. If you‚Äôre stash was full and the junk really was as important as you say tou should‚Äôve removed and dropped the 200 rad-x‚Äôs from your stash to clear up room.
---
 Good info thanks.
---
Carla never left Sanctuary for me.
---
Once I met her on the road.
---
Making moonshine isn't dangerous or unstable.  it isn't even very hard.
---
 Have you have seen a Dragon in action?
---
No worries, it‚Äôs not very intuitive but yea that‚Äôs how it works for better or worse.
---
 Interesting point. 
---
&gt; I didn't break any rules

---
I carry too many weapons also but I‚Äôm a rifleman and have no space in my stash and I like having options and couple different ammo for different ranges (sniper, lever or assault or handmade up close, varies on third, gauss rifle mostly for SBs, and a melee weapon just in case).
---
Between that and the copious meds, food, fusion cores etc I keep I live in Excavator even with thru-hiker, pharma and batteries
---
Either way would have been compensated and at our current lvls and skills the low lvl noobs would be like the great rains of Africa bringing food to us as we become gluttons on easily gotten gains!!
---
I nuked white spring last month got like 18. legandarys cause off the
---
 Ghouls it's one of the best aces to farm for legandarys when its nuked
---
Yo I cajnsale you 5. 20 caps each?? Send me a friend request DmoTorZ 
---
Jesus yes I need my bodies and skeletons whyyyy we can collect bones let me have skeletons ughh 
---
Yes and and I hate it. It's to big and bulky looking and I would rather just have the rifle over even a TSE Dragon.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong though 
---
Stupid people for a stupid generation.
---
Thank you for getting back to me, I appreciate it! I will submit a support ticket as instructed, but I know it won't be the first time they hear of this issue. I made a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aigict/make_the_scorchbeast_queen_unable_to_despawnturn/) where people were also having the exact same problem and on different platforms :)
---
How can they appeal to the masses of 12-year-olds with their mom's credit cards if they don't run around spouting memes?
---
sure, limited carry weight is realistic.
---
Limited stash weight is not realistic. it's not fun. it's a limitation. It sucks the fun out of collecting crap and crafting with it, this game's main non-combat gameplay loop.
---
What idiots actually believed that in the first place?
---
Hey buddy on pc but you can get 8 cores per hour from one of the three workshops near the plants. They stack in threes so check back often. 
---
Also use energy ammo perk to reduce their weight by 90% so you can carry 50+. As well as the duration increase by 100% perk.
---
Still easy, the game has few fail states. You can die but that never stops you from progressing 
---
So it's an empty case with a key that's a disc?
---
Phoenix beat the SB Queen and all her summons (or at least contributed and didn't die) at least once for us. He's BoS and tough as nails. If only the BoS had more of him, they'd still be around right now.
---
It sucks being a heavy gunner since all of the damage related perks that dont relate to explosives have to share a slot with almost all the weight related perks (aside from batteries included and through-hiker)
---
Yeah that's the another good question.
---
That sounds like something a Commie would say.
---
If they‚Äôre in their camp. I go up to them while waving (to grab their attention). Then I drop some stims, melons and if I have any gear / weapons their level. I drop that too. 
---
Waiting for the faction themed atom store events myself.
---
None of this kids play silly stuff.
---
Enclave, BOS, Responders , Raiders etc themes.
---
Dude, can we get 25+ servers? Everyone I play with is over 25 (my old ass self included). Lol. 
---
Lol. They were complete without mods. They are comparable games. Hell, two of them are the same franchise.
---
Well If you want to play a unforgiving game try "escape from tarkov". Highly recommended, great graphics, adrenaline pumping firefights, very tough to progress. 
---
I'm also curious. I'm way under leveled but sneaking around the cranberry bog. My tactic with super mutants is to shoot in the leg then run because I'm usually low on ammo. It works a lot but I can't seem to do it with creatures. 
---
Before they nerfed the Mirelurk Queens (yes, they were nerfed once already) one could easily take on three scortchbeasts and come out the winner. A 3-star Queen is  about as tough as a normal one used to be.
---
There‚Äôs a PC perk loadout mod, it definitely needs implemented into the fame by Bethesda, it‚Äôs a dream.  I have 8 to swap between currently, could use 10-12 but I‚Äôm greedy and like to keep my different crafting setups on their own (guns vs science vs armor/PA crafting) then I keep a solo basic, solo nuke area, group basic, group nuke area and a utility (travel, lockpick, hacking, ammo and chem crafting, workshop crafting etc all rolled into one).  I could really use two more for heavy weapons and melee that I‚Äôm working on light spec versions for occasional or SBQ swap in use.
---
lmao, exactly like Cito. Plus, I didn't buy the wild rags, so it doesn't matter anyways ;_; 
---
Good point about the rehashing 30-40% of previous problems, but I feel he does that so that new viewers can understand the context of what's going on with the Bethesda/FO76 situation without having to research it themselves instead of assuming people watching his videos know about all of the other stuff that has gone down.
---
As far as reporting every little thing, some things are minor but most are pretty interesting. I think he tries to pump out a video every day or two, so there's bound to be slow gamer news days. But ultimately yeah, I do think he's been milking FO76 in particular a bit much.
---
Top three PA requests on the sub.
---
1. Favortie the chassis.
---
2. Name the chassis to tell them apart.
---
3. Include Excavators and the rest into PA paint sets I.E BlackBird. Their 18 dollar price should cover all PA sets.
---
Moderation is key! I try to limit myself for only a few hours a night, chase after some vendors or level up my alts that have drastically different specials from my main.
---
You're right I can see the shop now. I'm semi new to modding and not sure how my fallout custom got there since I didn't put it. But now I know about it. Thank you!
---
Haha fun times. I kind of want that 76/76 killed players challenge... 
---
Yeah but assuming that WAS reality, you wouldn't be able to have 200 lbs of toasters on your back
---
Yongyea [TheQuartering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfwE_ODI1YTbdjkzuSi1Nag) and co are fulltime Youtubers who are paid monthly wage based by the number of clicks comment they receive on their videos. That is their primary motivation.

They are not gamers, who show gameplay or journalist who interview developers. They trawl gaming forums for divisive issues and produce videos to further stir the shit pot for clicks/money.

They are not doing their videos for altruistic reasons.

---
Plastic has been bugging out on me lately I have to remove and add it back to my inventory for it work. Usually have this happen when crafting shotgun shells
---
51 here, and I totally agree on both the reflexes and the fun. ;-)
---
The game is online, you download the game onto your system which the disc allows you to do (no different then buying it online and downloading it straight onto your system except you need the disc to do it) then in order to gain access to this online game you need your disc to gain entry while other players who downloaded their ‚Äúkeys‚Äù straight onto their systems don‚Äôt need that external disc to access the game that‚Äôs on their system. You paid for an empty box and a key, the disc is your key, the disc does not contain the online servers for fallout76.
---
Bummer. The stash is a much bigger problem to me than inventory. I‚Äôve finally got a pretty good feel for what ‚Äúmystery items‚Äù might be weighing me down (I‚Äôm looking at you, Inert Flux) but figuring out what‚Äôs filling up my stash is much more difficult. 
---
 Yeah, its entertaining for a while, but I like the pistol best.
---
so you want them to go pay-to-win? yeah that sounds like a great idea...
---
For what its worth I do like your idea it does engage the player which is a huge deal in games with intended playtimes over 100 hours.  
---
I knew you'd take the time to search high and low for any thing linking me to any sort of fault. I took my fault for my unknowing, when I was told otherwise, I was backed by the support of the players telling me the complete opposite. This statement says "take advantage of exploits", I didn't. The exploiter did. I had fun and gave back to the community with the items I was given, no where near what you're attempting to put on me. Still so many people posting here repeat themselves and attempt to prove what they think is fact and it continues to be wrong. Thanks for your opinion.
---
Maybe he was there farming shotgun shells. I do that all the time and folks think they are "helping me" by clearing out the non legendaries when actually, it's stealing all my ammo.
---
Think I have that one hrmm I‚Äôll have to check it‚Äôs one I know I got at least maybe the 20 one not sure which I have 
---
I'd like to know more. 
---
Build a floor and store it. Replace your stored floor out of the stored tab. If you have a phantom turret or such it should show up again on the placed floor.
---
I second, stopped using junk rat and switched to bandolier cause I don‚Äôt really carry a lot of junk on me, pretty easily keep myself topped off stash 100 of each little less or more depending on junk type, so better to run around with bandolier unless I‚Äôm specifically trying to top my junk back off.
---
I stopped storing any of my ammo in stash and just carry it all now.
---
I was just coming to say this. I thought it was clever. 
---
I'm a broke piece of shit and this game is totally worth 60 bucks. I bought it twice so a friend would play. Comfortable with that too.
---
I once gave a friend of mine 50 Caps to jump into one back in the Beta.
---
You don't just sing it the while time you're doing the event? That's what I do  
---
Yeah it's so good! I'm hidden away nice on the edge of a cliff. Love it!
---
"stealing kills"... No, they're just killing enemies. They don't have to share with anyone, the mobs in this game aren't public property, it's first come first serve. If they want to be nice and let other players tag enemies before they kill them, that's cool and all, but they by no means have to do that. Find a new spot to farm if you have such a huge problem with people "stealing" kills in PvE.
---
curse the blackbird power armor, I missed out on it &gt;:(
---
yup me as well
---
twice in 2 days
---
normal weapons all..
---
Regards

JM
---
Got to server hop really quick bro my camp couldn‚Äôt be placed and I need my stash lol rejoin on me??
---
I love the scarecrow raider idea I would buy that in a heartbeat. Although it would also look like your crucifying a raider which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it.  
---
I've been waiting for that.
---
I was just being a jackass because that meant the case wasn't empty.
---
Thank you for the words though, it makes sense. 
---
I tried to post this on a friend's account now trying again.  I am experiencing this as well.  It worked during beta but since it went live I cannot team with anyone.  You get the message player is not accepting invites at this time - everyone - every server - no matter the level - even if they are playing alone.  I also cannot hear any proximity chat not chatting with other players.  All I can do is make and see emotes.   I've contacted support and they mentioned they will try to get it in a patch.  2 Patches ago? For the greater good here is what I've tried so far... Hold power button on Xbox one for 6 seconds then pull power and wait 20 seconds before restarting.  I've completely uninstalled and reinstalled.  I've tried another Xbox one, brand new character all of this didn't work.  I'm thinking it has to be tied to the account somehow.  Or something I'm not thinking of.  Unfortunately I don't think they respond unless you are negative about the game in a #fallout76 tweet.  But wouldn't be because I love the game, just would like to partner up. It gets old trying to have a conversation with emotes. Lol
---
How did you find out this was it?
---
I started walking to vendors. Doing events on the way and hunting out those few map markers I missed. But yea, it got slow.
---
Check stats of the character not the item 
---
Honorable mentions are. 
---
Some way to preview the attached parts
---
Some type of display
---
In that case, Push to talk is right at your finger tips,  not hard to even signal, hey please dont kill the lowbies
---
I think they‚Äôre trying to make excuses for how his weight is so low and justify the stash increase.
---
Good on ya. Mistakes happen! But some folks have been intentionally doing it, and it's...irksome. 
---
Open a new vault. Vault 76-2. It consists of 24 instanced rooms, randomly assigned to a player on a server. Access to vault requires completion of the overseer's journey. It's a vault designed as a trading hub to be opened by vault 76's overseer once Vault 76's inhabitants have reclaimed enough of Appalachia. It has no means of food or water production, just 24 empty building spaces for vault 76's residents as well as an overseer's office and a reactor. Everyone inside this vault is set to pacifist automatically and each room comes with a vendor bot you can stock. All rooms would be completely equal in size and because you have to enter the room there would be no issue with game stability from trying to load 24 different build areas at the same time 
---
Except for the whole "making it properly so you don't go blind" thing. Other than that you're right. In fact, the water doesn't even have to be that pure.
---
Thats what i thought from the wording Thank you for the reply 
---
Excuse me but i'd describe it as more of a hergehrgehrgehrgehrgehrgehrgehrgehrgehrgergehgrehgrhegrhghegrhegrhrge beep boop &lt;crash&gt;
---
nah fam on pc
---
I had a shit day yesterday. Including a disconnect while staring at the BBQ ' S loading inventory.
---
I don‚Äôt really see an issue with carry weight. I‚Äôm using the meds, food, ammo and junk reduced weight perks though. I understand that I can‚Äôt min max, or have a master of all trades build though. I have chosen to be able to carry more crap around, as opposed to the beginning when I used a stealth sneak build. That said, sneak damage is still very helpful even without perking into it. And I‚Äôm just using a two shot .44 with a short range scope. It would be even better with a combat sniper or hunting rifle. It *was* better, but that‚Äôs the trade you make. I‚Äôm also storing gobs of guns in my stash. 
---
I missed the flames one. :(
---
They really should have them for atleast a week. Because some of us have to work and can't play every day to see these 24 hour sales.
---
Golf house full of a 100 high level glowing diseased stingwings...... frig I hate stingwings, bloodbugs.... well just about anything that flys and stings or jabs me with shit.... bastards scare me more than a deathclaw when I'm not wearing armour üòÜ
---
Did it actually re-download anything? I can't imagine just running a check would do anything. It would need to re-download something (a corrupt file) for it to really change anything.
---
One of the things I suspect that is effecting people's game play is using a LFG system outside of the game (not that one really exists in game). I noticed that when we had a guy from Poland that joined our SBQ kills that most of the time he would complain about things despawning for him and not being able to loot the SBQ. I suspect lag when joining a regional server where you are not located contribute a large ammount to crashed and disconnects.  I generally notice that when I just join a random game rather than join a friend I seem to be a lot more stable.
---
My main point is that people don't have to be such jerks about PvP. It's one thing to take over a workshop and initiate PvP. It's quite another to only target people that are so many levels lower than you that it only takes a shot or two to kill them. That's just douchbaggery at its finest.
---
It was the one item I was almost to low on every time it happened and since shotgun ammo only uses like 4 mats it was easy to narrow down. 
---
im glad, this means we still have a chance for mods and private servers
---
I would imagine so, but am not 100% certain
---
Not that hard to type in Zenimax EULA into search then search the page for "exploit". You could've  done it yourself instead of  falsely claiming you read the agreement and still found nothing wrong with what you did.
---
Did  you or did yoy not obtain plans and items you used yourself by having and trading duped items? You said elsewhere in this  thread you did. Just as you used some of the 4000 of  those Stimpaks. So you took advantage of an exploit. Directly or indirectly, you still took advantage of an exploit by continuing to use and distribute duped items.
---
Geez, I've seen instances of false victim complexes but this one tops them all... Grasping at any straw to excuse what is a clear cut situation - you took duped items. You started trading them. You found out the items were duped. You continued trading them. No "people liked it" or "but I was giving back to the community", or "I had fun" is a valid excuse. You cheated, but keep grasping at these sad excuses... On 2nd thought, please don't buy another copy. There are enough ignorant players out there already. We don't need another deluded "vigilante" polluting the game.
---
Neato, glad it's not only me.  Just started avoiding that train station.
---
Not to sound like a smart ass but -- you'll get used to √≠t. Just keep going.
---
I think I've seen it at the free states or one of the watoga vendors recently.
---
Still an issue 1/22/19
---
Again. One comment. And you're the one who keeps talking about it. 
---
I'm always amused by folks who demand that people not read reality into fiction, as though fiction isn't anything but political commentary.  I could draw any number of parallels between fascist hate groups and the brotherhood...but it'ed fall on deaf ears. 
---
Need some details.
---
Level?.
---
Your current zone your in?.
---
How coincidental, I'm on Xbox and I just switched my character to be a Revolver build! Sign me up!
---
i really do appreciate that !
---
*"But why can't I equip this UNIQUE item with another UNIQUE item?? They both "UNIQUE" in them."*
---
Yea I love the pistols their my fav black powder weapon in this game. I used to always have 2 of em on me, it's just that it was too much to have at least 9 of my perk points just for those pistols so I stopped using em.
---
Yeah, by the flower on the map. It was a great camp but I got tired of not being able to place it so I relocated. 
---
I believe if someone initiated pvp on your Workshop they can then find you and pvp you regardless if you are at the workshop or not 
---
It‚Äôs obvious but I‚Äôll let you figure it out. 
---
give them shit, and I mean literal shit, Fertilizer is good for early players in the Forest because most of them start farming and that's a good way to give them a bit of a nudge.
---
1.) What platform are you playing on?
---
Xbox One.

2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account

3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable) nope.

4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
 Everytime. My sound is freaking weird. If i put the chat option on none, or team, the sound is what i consider normal. But if i put it on area or auto, everything is super quiet. Also randomly my mic will quit picking up my voice or stop working all together,  even though i would be just talking to someone, and they heard me, but then out of nowhere they can't hear me. It doesnt happen on any other game, nor in party char, ever. So it's fallout... get your crap together Bethesda.
---
5) Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number (if applicable
---
Its not going free to play, bethesda already debunked this on twitter
---
Ah, so it wouldn't go down too much further. Maybe 6-10%
---
There are a ton of friendly players in the game. My advice is to always pay it forward: help others, share excess plans and recipes, be the player to others that you would like to encounter yourself.
---
First bit.
---
Health consistently low and starving. This is not like your normal Fallout game. You will require food and water to survive.
---
Reccomend:
---
Water purifiers at camp and put down a nice field of plants to grow. Get the green thunb perk to double your yield. I find corn soup is a good item to make.
---
You cannot ignore your food and drink requirments. Its also important that if you don't have the lead belly perk to make sure yout cooking all your food and drinking only boiled or purified water.
---
Claim at least 1 workshop on the map. It costs a few caps but you will unlock more camp items once you do. Than just ignore the workshop because most of them arent worth it. But the exp and items from defending them are nice especially early on.
---
After you build at the workshop and get the camp items. Go find a junk pile out in the wild (not at a workshop) and build your camp there. You than can build an extractor and generator on it and it will slowly collect random junk for you even springs, screws and adhesive which are allways needed.
---
Dont bother repairing your armor. Either find new stuff or repair it. Up untill level 25 (I think) you dont need balistic fiber to craft it.
---
Fast traveling to a friend is free. Also fast traveling to your camp or the vault enterance or owned workshops is also free.
---
Dont feel the need to rush to level up. There is lots to do and see and everything you do will give you exp. And at the moment there isnt much endgame stuff to do.
---
Get the excavator armor that took care of that problem I can carry like 400
---
yea you'll want rank dos

#fakenews
---
Your in the damn wasteland not at Nuka world!!
---
It's not a bad idea, but I would wonder if having that much stuff in a small area would be feasible without introducing lag to that area.  As a solo player I'd prefer a bigger budget.
---
!remindme 12 hours
---
Saw someone nuke the Palace of the Winding Path. Got there about 5 min later, went through the whole place and saw 2 meat piles. Not even any other players there.
---
How did you sell missiles to a vendor? I really want to know.
---
&gt;I used to be an adventurer, like you. Then I took too much loot. 
---
The dieing every few minutes outside of not keeping your bars up. Is most likely due to fighting enemies higher level than yourself without good gear.
---
Follow the green area into the bottom area (lava zone look) into the desert area into the mire into the robot city then last Whitespring.
---
So many think using the word ignorant as many times as they feel just sums it all up. You have failed to see any part of this message. I have seen the perspectives of so many of the Fallout community first handedly and it is that of Reddit that is the most spiteful. To say I took advantage of an exploit directly or indirectly is to say every person who has fallen prey to a duped item has done the same, that's still not the case and once again people are summing up so many to be criminals and ill players. I couldn't imagine the way you must judge everyone that you go out of your way to mock. 
---
Lolol.. yeah, you're real important. Im sure you're passing all these suggestions along. Poor devs... I seriously feel bad for the people doing the actual work while ghouls like you just dance around acting like youre doing something. Fuck. Lol 
---
No one ever worried, except, you know, the most talented public.
---
oh man, that's actually a pretty sweet idea. 
---
Based on the fact that Console, pc digital and physical sales only made back their marketing budget and didn't meet sales expectations. The only way you win back an audience from such a colossal failure, and don't get it wrong fallout 76 was a commercial failure, is to put everything on the table and hope the whales bite and they find something redeeming from this mess.
---
Regardless of what Rhetoric this subreddit says about 76 being "a good game" a vast majority of people don't believe so. Even if I think it's an ok game to sink a couple hours in I don't think I'd ever invest in the microtransaction economy simply because of the fact that I bought the game for $60 on the bethesda website and 2 days after that they reduced the price to $30 and some online retailers had it for as low as $28.
---
So regardless of it being tomorrow or 6 months from now Fallout 76 will be free to play, it's just a matter of how much time that will take. They're going to announce a massive content update in the middle of Q1 that will "fix" some of the issues players have with end game content, it'll release some time in Q2 and then if people aren't buying the game they'll announce a free to play version with the deal being that you can play for the first 20 levels and if you like it you can keep playing it but you'll be stuck at 20 which the studio believes will cause players to upgrade to the paid version. This update will also increase the number of players on a server you can have at the same time so it'll feel like the wasteland has more population then just you and a couple buddies against the world. Somewhere between 24 players and 36 players all at the same time.
---
They re-released it on Steam a few months ago and it's just like......whyyyyy? My condolences on the founder pack, lol. 
---
The last bit of info you gave regarding gear. Unlike previous games all gear is level capped and requires certain levels to use it.
---
I can't really play during the week but friday night/Saturday/Sunday early morning (PST) I can do stuff. I'm level 85ish and would love to build everyone and everyone a handmade and redo some of the main quests. Add badgerstain if you want me to come along and constantly complain about not having enough acid or lead for my 5.56.
---
Will the dev team fix auto grenade launcher weight reduction when applying bear arms? Also there are problems with the barbarian perk applying the 80 DR for it. It's not changing the stat number when you try to apply the perk.  Used to in the beginning when I first played, then it started only giving 60 DR instead of 80. Now it doesn't do anything so idk if its even working at this point.
---
Don‚Äôt rush the quests. Let the map unfold for you.  Lots of places to explore, take your time, and enjoy the distractions heading your way.
---
Honestly, I don't think those people are patient enough to grind through a game like FO76. This isn't Fortnite
---
Damn it Jim, he's a developer,  not an accident greek builder.  (Column is ionic)
---
This is amazing! This should be an official server event! 
---
Get yourself a Vampire's weapon if you can. Free healing's invaluable at lower levels. Beyond that, all I can say is set up C.A.M.P. somewhere and build some crops and water purifiers. 
---
It doesn't 
---
People don't like Fallout76 so they're more than happy to latch onto anything negative to justify the fact that they've never played the game and why they shouldn't
---
I agree with you there. I just don‚Äôt see the fun in killing someone that has no chance but those types are in every game.
---
Tom Morello? Isn‚Äôt that the dude from the first Mafia game?
---
WAIT THERE IS A FRIENDLY DOG?!?? 
---
Gotta pick certain flowers
---
Congrats!! They are hard to find for sure.
---
Yep.  It is funny how, from what I have seen, on "liberals" do bad things and conservatives never do.  He appears to have the research skills of a flat Earther.
---
Hazmat suit...I run low health unarmed and use hazmat in nukes zones. Works a treat with all my resistance buffs
---
Simple just need PVP servers and PVE servers nothing else will sate it.
---
PVE servers :
---
No player damage and base damage.
---
Players can teleport out of someones base regardless of enemies nearby to stop griefing.
---
Workshops remain the only open pvp spots in the pve servers but once your past its radius pve rules apply again.
---
Bounties are no longer a thing.
---
Only you or your party can loot your dropped dead bag.
---
PvP servers :
---
No hold back rules its a pure free for all. Be on your guard. Those who are the strongest will decide how something will play out.
---
Maybe they will be kind and go on their way or maybe they will destroy everything from you.
---
Is FO76 even listed on Twitch? Last time I looked it was so far down, so nobody is going to see it anyways.
---
It's not like it would be any work for them; just release the Nuka World assets. Lord knows Bethesda's not shy about asset flipping for money, after all. 
---
Dude I feel yah my build  is a sneak shotguner and I find myself constantly switching my points around just to carry more loot
---
I've picked bloodleafs and rhododendrons - but they are not being counted
---
Isn‚Äôt that more lethal to the user than the target? In terms of radiation damage? Or is that just something from FO4?
---
What level are you?
---
My suggestions.
---
There is a perk which let's you 'search' med containers for additional meds. You get lots of disease cures.
---
Build a camp and make some water purafiers. Easy health right there. As for food. Grow some crops. Head to Morgantown airfield. From the trainstation head along the road and enter the front toward the airstrip (not the part where the med tents are located) you should find a few musical instruments. Look up to the left away from the main building and you should find a field with crops which include pumpkin. Take these and plant them. Grow them and make soup for easy food hunger and water.
---
Yeah, where's that Enclave Pip-Boy they datamined a while back, anyway?
---
It was added a while after you made the post,  it replaced the camo hunting rifle skin.
---
Thanks for letting us know
---
gg
---
He does like to blame everything on the "left" while deleting comments that point out the "right" acts the same way.  He tries to act like he is impartial but his actions don't show that.  Please note this doesn't make him racist but it does bring question as to his true character.
---
I think I'm level 15 and I'm just south of the "top of the world" trying to craft things for the story missions that go on there. I haven't found any plans for armor upgrades that I can craft yet. I'm still trying to get the hang of staying hydrated and fed but what's tough is all of the diseases that I can't craft disease cures for yet. People have suggested getting or building things that I just don't have access to yet. 
---
I remember when I first found Fallout 2 and Fallout boxed together and bought them. I poured so many hours into both of them. I never played BoS for Xbox, but I poured a great many hours into Fallout Tactics... And it was the best fallout for me for a long time. GameSpy arcade and boonville! The first online experience with fallout and I loved it. I edited fallout tactics to add in my picture and pictures of friends so I could create me and put my friends in the recruit pool. FO3 worried me initially, but I ended up enjoying it and hording hundreds of guns and armors in megaton. NV was great too. Fo4 I loved the settlements, but not the constant hand holding of protection. And 76? I got it a month ago and I love it. Sure there are problems, but my big gripe is the stash. I'm currently playing around with the idea of turning my camp into a BoS recruiting office where I give away lvl 25 sets of t45 PA and help people start the process of joining the brotherhood of steel. Hahaha 
---
You would have to make the mash from wood pulp, and then run it through a still made from old car parts full of lead, for it to be in any way dangerous.  Or cut it with something deadly like cheap methanol.
---
People did all those things because they're cheap or stupid.  Not because it's hard.
---
Why you are the way you are? Can't just let people like and have fun with the game? Lol
---
If our perk cards affected our stash I think that would help, should something get 20lbs heavier because I stopped carrying it and put it in a box?  Granted if you changed perk cards that could be an issue.  Maybe add slots to the stash to apply Perk Cards to it?  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Another option would be one that I'm sure has been mentioned but allow the stash as general storage where we can access it while out and about like we do now and have local storage options like the magazine rack being able to hold books, a suitcase could hold clothes, explosives and ammo boxes, ect. 
---
For some reason, the one I followed didn't see me as a threat and was injured. I walked with him for a while until I built up my courage. He didn't want to be my friend, and I experienced shell shock for the first time. 
---
I think the next update is supposed to have stuff to facilitate player-traders, isn't it?
---
[Cut from the game.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cbortvX4lbLW2iX0OFPHf8cdjUUQINDWDoYWiHL-080/edit)

&gt; Cut Content
---
&gt;**Home Brew** - create Muttberry Shine, Sunday Shine and Tater Shine whilst fending off waves of creatures. Seemed to be intended to take place at Sunday Brothers‚Äô Cabin, where there are a number of interactable ‚Äòstills‚Äô that have no use.
---
Idea I really like: this.
---
I hope so too! Thank you!
---
im interested. how does fifteen bucks sound?
---
Get yourself a Gatling gun, with faster firing speed then upgraded with the Speedy receiver. Then get martial artist, because for some odd reason and let you crank the Gatling gun faster. It's better on a mold than a minigun, the ammo is easy to find and easy to craft, and hits like a brick
---
Back in my day, we couldn‚Äôt fast travel on the way to our deaths, we had to walk every step of the way!
---
Worse than just the queens are the attending 3 kings who surround you with a crossfire to which there is no mitigation.  In a swamp behind the foliage.
---
I‚Äôm sure if I was really close to a target than yep, I‚Äôd be dead. 
---
Post was mostly my attempt at sarcasm, as this thing is busted/useless. First pull of the trigger spends all your ammo. Spent 400 fusion cells in half a second, didn‚Äôt even kill the robot I was aiming at. 
---
Is this serious? How did u get him way out there to the fissure site?
---
Same here running mole travelling vendor rat on x box 
---
I personally like to just follow the tracks or rivers with a new character. You can set all the train station locations on your map by activating the pins on the map at any station. It might help you get around.
---
I suppose not. I still miss hoarding and collecting things though, on display or not. Collecting things is fun, throwing them away isn't.
---
If only it was on a gun that is actually useful... =)
---
I throughly enjoyed tactics. You just have to take it for what it is. It was pretty cool to try that engine w/o the mandatory tbs. it isnt long and its very straight forward :)
---
Ok so I went to the spot south of harpers ferry where the train tracks meet the road. 
---
Found an albino deathclaw level 63. It isn't letting me tame him. Only pacify. 
---
Not sure what I'm doing wrong. 
---
That's the point. You can choose an overpowered character build that can't fight for a sustained time because it can carry limited resources, or you can choose a less powerful build that can fight for longer because they can carry more resources. That's why this is the way it is.
---
Level 15 you should be the green area still pushing towards the bottom area of the map. The area your in i would wait until atleast 25 ish.
---
Are you on pc?.
---
Yeah not the best one but hey, maybe that‚Äôs a start. I have heard (unconfirmed) that high luck stats are related to how rare your legendary finds are. 
---
All of my perks that can go to reducing weight do. If weapons didn't break after two minutes of use, I would be able to lessen my load really easily.
---
If you got to the challenge and hover over it it will show what you need
---
It might be a reference to Michael Crichtons "Congo".
---
The only concern that comes to mind is how drastic that would be. Specifically if you can transfer your character between servers (like ARK). 
---
That would become full PvP where anything and everything will get destroyed just because they can. Of course, I imagine a no rules server where bounties are non existent in the PvP servers. It would seem weird to issue bounties for PvP in a PvP based server.
---
It seems cost inefficient for the mass amount of servers that would involve (I assume, idk personally)
---
Likewise, there are players who like PvE with a touch of PvP. It should be all in on one or the other 
---
At least with the defensive perk cards it would allow PvP, just with minimal consequence while still giving PvP players that experience. It would come down to cost vs reward. Especially if they were to design it in a way that allowed a level playing field for level to level play. The biggest goal here would be to level the playing field when it‚Äôs the lvl 150 player trying to destroy a lvl 40 players CAMP and loot his body. (Just an example) out of boredom or for kicks and laughs 
---
nice.
---
Yeah, for what I've noticed that glitch has been since the beta. Idk if they're ever going to fix it. Nice find though. I got a ghoul slayers gamma gun though. Beat that!
---
Lol. Love it. 
---
I just sent a friend request. Look out for Joshuad80
---
:) 
---
I don't mind it actucally. I just wish it got balanced with difficulty in games.
---
For example in NV, if you play on hardcore, it should be VERY realistic and make it a real management thing, where you can only carry so so much, while if you play on easy it's basically unlimited. 
---
I think you missed the point,
---
I WANT the stash to be upgraded. I'm saying that keeping it small helps them.
---
It makes you struggle to have things, to craft things, it means you need to spend more and more time managing resources.
---
So the appeal of being able to just BUY a plan via the ATOM shop becomes more appealing. the more they make the game a struggle the more people want to part with money to have an easier time.
---
The game is the way it is to sell ATOM, Its a business.
---
why do you think the shop keeps getting lots of new content but the game doesn't?
---
$$$
---
Fml
---
Now we know for sure what was nonsense or not due to the official statement. I'm not sure what your getting at here I was saying that people posting here about it helped as we now have an official statement on the manner so the speculation on it that kept popping up is now put to rest. The reddit posts on it were needed in order to get to this point where Bethesda cleared it up.
---
lol Easy. I don‚Äôt mean no harm.
---
That would make sense. Thank you; repeated Darwin Award qualifications failed to teach me this lesson.
---
Just mute the jackass?
---
Not that it matters, but His pacifist doesn‚Äôt affect this, only yours.  The system is silly and illogical....
---
Events besides the random quests you could potentially find, out in the world.
---
Closest to the station neighbor. 
---
New Vegas was the only game I've ever gotten that was literally unplayable at release.
---
I'm not afraid of downvotes.
---
I‚Äôm at Brahmin pond. Hope to see you one day! 
---
I'm a fan of runs through West Tek and also the Watoga Highschool event.
---
no thats not the place it's north of the  thundar mountain subsation tm-01 there is a road and a track  head almost due northeast from the substation and you will see a train car with NAR on it that is the place
---
Happens to me too recently. You‚Äôll just have to rebuild the fucker over again. I‚Äôm honestly pissed off about this glitch. It also happens if my friend is within the area of my camp when I spawn in, even though he‚Äôs not within any of my buildings.
---
Are you on a pc?
---
Reeeeeallll nice.
---
Phoenix, the Brotherhood robot
---
had a very tiny store
---
And when the other bots shot him
---
He declared eternal robot war
---
Nothing more annoying than going to where he **should** be. Only to find him on the other side of Watoga fighting a scorch beast. 
---
I will!
---
I'm on a PS. Might see you out there, Chuckles. Lol. 
---
I'm not a fan of his so I can't say if he does or doesn't do that. I've seen him in multiple videos and might agree/disagree like any other uploaders commentary or reaction. I can however say from what I've seen his comments and "omg dis guy sexists/racist proof here!!". Some are justified and he blows things out of context. Others are however purposely made to make him look worse then he was, at least for that situation. Can he be a dick at times? Sure. Is he a sexist racist as some would love to liable him? I would have to disagree. Until he does or says something that would justify such a life ruining liable I'll disagree.
---
On topic of blaming the left I'll agree and disagree depending on the topic at hand. I would personally separate the Left from Liberals. Liberals have done great things in history. The Left, not so much.
---
And if he does delete comments then I'll agree that's a double standard prick move. Unless a comment is racist, reveals personal info, ect(TOS type breaking comments) then it shouldn't be deleted. Just because you disagree with someone's comment, opinion or fact, doesn't justify deleting it.

/sorryaboutrant

Advertising companies have monetized and utilized the loads upon loads of junk meta data we once thought only accesible by creepy government surveillance systems. The same shit used to catch insurgents is a private market product anyone can buy, the company owning it going public sometime this year. The stuff we have no reason to hide builds profiles about us beyond just interests. It makes a map of your life. Sounds like too much? It is. It's such new tech that there are no laws involved yet, meaning the ethics of its use is left up to the company distributing it. Yeahhh. 
---
Combine that with the bot armies trying to influence every major top 100 web site? We get things like 2 separate Facebooks, Right and Left with VERY little overlap, as well as subreddit split, again with next to no overlap. 
---
Feel conspiracy-ish talking about it, but god damn if big data isn't the subject of the decade. Its effects have leaked into everything and it makes it feel so fake and sour, ya know?
---
They removed cap stashes?
---
Likewise.....If someone in pacifist mode jumps in front of your explosive shot and kills you........go farm somewhere else.
---
Except that a rushed game isn't bad forever. Numerous rushed games have turned out really good. Look at Dark Souls 1. That games was very rushed but still became a massive sensation and basically spawn an entire sub-genre of games. (yes I realize Demon's Souls did it first, but Dark Souls is when it broke through to the mainstream.)
---
If you look at the picture, it is probably a reference to the original ‚ÄúPlanet of the Apes‚Äù movie from 1968.
---
Taylor (Charleton Heston) was given the nickname ‚ÄúBright Eyes‚Äù by Zira (Kim Hunter) because his eyes were bright blue.
---
Yeah, ‚Äúoverly negative internet opinions‚Äù and all that, but...sometimes you have to call out a slimy, racist sexist neck beard piece of shit for what it is.
---
Poor youtube. So desperate for content.
---
I have wears if you have ~~coin~~ caps.
---
PVP and PVE don't mix well at all.
---
If someone wants to pvp go to a pvp server. The thing is like many games have shown in the past. PvP will always mean people killing one another on mass.
---
Its why i hate pvp in Fallout 76 it just does not work both from lore and gameplay.
---
But heres the kicker those of us that want PVE servers are told no. You gotta mingle with these idiots that enjoy destroying one another and everything you own.
---
Also not happy that the Sentinel armor with the affix of player damage is becomming meta and stacks so high. Damage reduction needs to cap out atleast 75% for pvp regardless of what is pushing it above it.
---
PvP and PVE servers are the only way to go. No middle ground will ever work to make both sides happy.
---
ROFL wow that's a shit argument.  
---
I appreciate these. Thank you.
---
Seriously !! Totally agree !!! And you make all this effort to sell  a 2 star vampiric pickaxe for 3-4  lousy caps and then it‚Äôs up for sale instantly for 467 caps WTF??!!! the economy in this game is bullshit! I end up dropping more than I care to admit I literally dropped my 2 shot 50 cal which I lugged around for 30 levels because that P.O.S didn‚Äôt work for crap against anything and I was way to over encumbered (stash maxed out of course)and out of vendor caps!!!!
---
What level are you and what is your build? 
---
Put them all in your stash or take them all out
---
That's down South right? I had mine there for a bit and it would happen every time I logged in, but no other camp would be there. I thought maybe because I was a little too close to the edge of the map so I moved it North a little, but still happened. 
---
5 point per strength doesn't make much sense. A strong human can only carry 250lbs of weight on them??? And the best we can achieve is 450 with advanced Power Armor??? Give me a break. I don't think add more points is the answer I think making it plus 10 carry weight per strength point is more appropriate. The world's record for bench press is 1075lbs (487.6kg) and the world's record for squat is 1268 lb (575 kg) and your telling me that these men could only walk around with 250 lbs of gear??? I don't think so. 
---
Also think they need to raise the stash limit again too. As 600lbs stash is way too low it think it should be around 1000lbs if not 1200lbs. With these two changes I think I'd feel like Bethesda is finally listening a little, and trying to make the customer base happy after such a buggy release from a trusted developer!
---
And the ability to cook steak on the grill.  NOT stir it in a pot!
---
Cos there's no reason to lock your doors.  Camps are convenient for everyone, and there's no cost to you of letting others use your camp facilities.  So denying them by locking the doors is seen as antisocial and some people believe the appropriate response is to remove the offending camp..
---
Maybe not the exact same problem, but this has happened to me when I try to buy from vendors. I have enough caps but the store tells me I don't. Sucks if you find something you really want, but it's only happened twice so it's not the end of the world :)
---
And just after you have launched your nuke and fast travel to whitesprings... d/c
---
Be able to make a base with other people and then be able to have an "outpost" ?
---
lul nice fornite joke in 2019
---
/s
---
You're gonna kill it! Good choice
---
I could see combing 3 and a but load of flux and you only get 2 of the effects not all 3 and would be completely random 
---
Thanks. I like the songs but was sick of hearing them
---
AMEN!!!
---
That's way too op. Even more than tse currently is 
---
Be nice if we could.  Keep getting that .44 ivory grip plan.  dumped 4 copies in a lunch box down in Watoga one day
---
You know rad storms may be extremely weak in this game and uncommon, but they still don't register play made houses as protection which is kinda disappointing aswell. 
---
I do kind of miss the Glowing Sea. That place really did feel treacherous and threatening. Going there was an event.
---
Where's Luigi?
---
\~15 you're probably getting too deep into higher level territory if you're hitting Top of the World already.  Or at least you're visiting places that higher level players tend to visit which affects enemy scaling.  I'd recommend digging deeper into the forest zone for a little longer to raise your levels up since you're struggling there.
---
Wouldn't hurt to find a friend to play with a bit to help back you up too.  That can make a big difference when starting out
---
You pull numbers from thin air. as far as sales figures I cant find any hard numbers just things like this https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/11/19/fallout-76-sales-compared-fallout-4/#/slide/1
---
which claim that in the uk fallout 76 has sold about 80% less physical copies than fallout 4, but also says "Fallout 76 surpassed its competition for the week of November 13th in terms of revenue" so take that for what it is worth. and again that is physical sales. they have no data for digital.
---
even https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-first-month-sales-heres-how-the-game-d/1100-6464002/ put fallout 76 at the 4th spot in novemeber again WITHOUT digital sales information.
---
My point was never that it was a blockbuster. I never claimed that. I claimed it was profitable. the 2 terms are not the same.
---
What other word would there be? They updated it to say they won‚Äôt be removing two shot from the drop pool and that explosive will be getting nerfed too, but they aren‚Äôt rolling back the change if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. 
---
If your on PC maybe one day!  Ive seen some folk just south of the brahmin pond so they can build on the little river with a cliffside. 
---
Excavator armor mods at Responders eh? Might get into server hopping like a madman for that; don't think I've gotten one from the spawn points I've been checking into.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Complete or not they are different kinds of games compared to a survival game.
---
Yeah but you can earn more daily, weekly, and, I think, by starting a new character. So you never really hit a point where you've earned all of the free ones.
---
The real TIL is always in the comments.
---
Yes, way too irritating. Just with armour, a few (3) guns and some basic aid I need to constantly travel in excavator power armour to stay underweight. As soon as I start to grab junk I‚Äôm overencumbered and need PA to fast travel, or run for that matter. 
---
yeah. I took some rad-x, suppressed my Speed Demon...fuck me that was awful.
---
Legendary robots are pretty common there but not usually in those numbers, you just got very lucky. More crappy loot for vendors.  :P
---
The Board was probably uncomfortable putting alcohol production in the cannibal zombie dismemberment game... got to keep it E for Everyone!
---
what moron would believe this anyway. One of the most greedy game companies ever making a game free to play, sweet summer children
---
‚ÄúDo you or someone you know suffer from Radworms? Call 555-272-4500 now and get your free information packet.‚Äù 
---
i mean thats why we got this rushed mess, right?
---
It was already mentioned but if you put them all in your stash or pick up all the needed materials, it'll work. Weird but that's just how it is
---
I‚Äôm dieing laughing right now! Why would that shit be an explosive! I guess if you‚Äôre throwing away all your Fusion Cells why not go out with a bang?
---
I'm kinda stuck in the game right now, I can't complete recruitment blues, because of it... :(
---
what do you mean
---
Not everyone has that much time. Itd be pretty frustrating to use the 2 hours you have to play for the next 3 days, on a waste of a nuke. It already sucks enough when that happens and the sbq drops you a 1* wood left arm.
---
 Oh come on I got a Mutants Wood Chest just the other day. 
---
Don't you just miss people? 
---
same whhat?!!!!
---
Someone's taking the Well Rested perk to a whole new level. 
---
I have my camp on the golf course for this exact reason
---
Are you sure you lost caps due to a bounty and not just pvp? If you die to a player at all, you lose caps equal to your level 
---
There are three near Slocum Joe's; one kind off to the right and two kinda behind the bus.
---
We all float down here
---
Thanks buddy would love to know.
---
If you are like me you were expecting a more social, mmo experience but feel like you got a mediocre single player game with other people in it.
---
I wanted to raid, I wanted to build cities and join factions and build robots and production facilities. What I got was running in circles on a golf course killing one kind of monster :(
---
Ah, okay. Nothing of mine is locked, but I was just curious because if I am running along I‚Äôm not lucky to try and run into someone else‚Äôs camp to begin with and if I for some reason decided to I wouldn‚Äôt be offended if it was locked up. Although, I am slightly shy and antisocial so that could be why. Haha.
---
I have a table outside of my camp. I place a bag of crap I dont want in there and then wander the waste land. All I ask is that you dont kill my cows. They are shit cows, not eating cows. 
---
Massive amount of crashes on ps4
---
I overheard a guy offer a new guy 100 caps to set me up for a hit. He did t realize that proximity chat has a really wide range.
---
This also needs to be a related event. Gather the moonshine ingredients to make the still and receive the plan for the still as a reward üòÅ
---
Trophies on consoles give the numbers.
---
Go find FO76 on Twitch and tell me this game is popular. Get your scroll wheel lubed up because it's a long journey down.
---
It's funny, I said the exact same thing a month ago in this sub, and I got some - 30 karma for it, and a dozen angry players telling me to stop bitching. Seems like the casual players are finally starting to catch up in total hours played. I think it's the difference between those who have played 40 hours and those who have played hundreds.
---
Pro tip, I eventually got a full set of weapon weight reduction armor which allows me to carry all the weapons I want. It helped a lot. 
---
Best in slot if you‚Äôre playing an elf. You did roll an elf right?
---
I can agree on sales but that doesn't definitively prove free to play.
---
And prices of the game are all over the place.  People are reporting as low as 8.99 pounds in the UK but still full price in some places in the US.  
---
Wonderful theory of how the next year of the game may play out but it is still a theory based on what concrete evidence?
---
As for your insider trading info, you got this info from where again?  And why use Fortnite as an example? Its a battle royale game.
---
A lot of what you're talking about is pure supposition.
---
Bud.
---
Thanks for the heads up on the new account! 
---
You got a few downvotes there, but being unpopular doesn't make your opinion wrong.  I don't see a commercially viable long term plan based on a single purchase of a discounted game either.
---
For FO76 to thrive, it needs to provide a revenue stream - or more accurately a profit stream - to Bethesda.
---
Done well, Free-to-play can enhance games by expanding the community.  (How many posts have we seen from people asking if it's worth buying, even at ridiculous discounts?)    They'd have to work out a non pay-to-win strategy, but other games have pulled it off so there's models to follow.
---
Is he still up?
---
This sounds like me.
---
I know *exactly* how this is done, and, its usually not an accident. Unless you really screwed something up haha.
---
From cow shit cometh methane ?
---
That would make the top of the world ski resort an even better place for lead

No sorry
---
OP, the buyer's remorse is strong in this one. 
---
YES, I was pissed I could craft excavator torso earlier 
---
/*pulls gun and readies clone/*
---
It's connected to doors. Doors somehow lock to a specific part of the blueprint structure and cause it to be added to the stored tab. If there are 2+ doors involved with a single room, the assignments overlap, resulting in it reproducing the blueprint set for however many doors you have.
---
Remove doors before moving CAMPs if you can. It's an annoying bug that should be fixed relatively soon. 
---
Jullz do you still want the 3\* Right Arm? I am in the Eastern time zone
---
PSA pacifist mode would have zero effect on this whatsoever. Pacifist mode only stops a player from damaging others not receiving damage. 
---
We didn't pull him out there. He must have been on one of his typical walkabouts, and must have already wandered well into the bog. He and the SB Queen aggroed on each other before we got to her. Come to think about it, based on his walking speed (very slow), he would have had to have survived the nuke strike as well. Didn't think about that before. Now that's one tough robot!
---
well I was off a bit its 10% not 20% but its also 10% food and 15% water so its still a good soup 
---
personally I like swap tofu and melon water as both have a hp regeneration feature that as I just eat and drink allow me to heal up pretty quick 
---
Idea:
---
Power Fist Adapter (MOD) for your PA arms. Allows Power Fist to be equipped while wearing PA, could give a +X% damage if both arms have the mod. 
---
Simple
---
I‚Äôm fine with that, I still have at least 100 more mod slots to grind out with weapons alone. I‚Äôm under cap with bulk and sale. 
---
Mini nukes and missile would be far more valuable if you could scrap them or even a bulk of them for screws. I personally use both a fat man and missile launcher, but from what I can tell, most people hate finding that stuff
---
Try planting razorgrain at your camp. Razorgrain soup is good because it fills hunger and thrist 
---
What were you thinking price wise?
---
The question remains, "How does Bethesda plan to maintain the expansion and support of FO76 in a commercially viable manner if the only revenue stream is the initial purchase + a very limited Atom store"?
---
I want Bethesda to make money from FO76 because that's the only way it has a future.
---
They go for much more on eBay...
---
What can you offer?
---
I do feel that at the heart of it there isn't enough enemies to go around. You'd think with 24 players in a 5 mile square area we wouldn't have to constantly be standing on top each other fighting over ghouls.
---
My stash anymore only holds bobbleheads, magazines, non-perishable food stuff on occasion, and huge amounts of junk materials. It's pretty terrible. 
---
From what I heard, it's a rare and random encounter. 
---
I mean 5 points worth of non combat perks I don't feel would be much of anything thats a few weight perks or the lockpick perks 
---
Now I need him to die so I can scrap his materials for armour build
---
I'd have done the PvP differently. In  events like the Civil War fort everyone should be stripped of all armour, weapons and Perks and given a Union or Confederate uniform and a black powder gun of some sort (anachronism aside).
---
I get what they are going for, sort of, but it more feels like they tacked PvP on to cash in on the sweet 2015 survival game boom.
---
I liked how Borderlands did the PvP aspect. 
---
Sort of. There are some challenges like learn 76 recipes that can't really be done on one character (mainly because it's bugged and doesn't track for most people, but I mean even once it's fixed), but you still earn from the same challenge pool on different characters. 
---
 I laughed out loud and sold it for 7 caps, with 3 stages of deal perks on. ;)
---
Sometimes people will "hold" Graham and come here and bring people into the server. Other than that I don't think tracking Graham is possible. He doesn't just follow one big route, he has many routes he can possibly take. He'll spawn at one, walk it for a bit and eventually despawn for awhile. When he spawns back in it'll be along a different and random route.
---
There is a still near 76 you could set up your camp near
---
Man, I say cut them some slack.
---
Imagine what we'd have done with easily accessible technology to have people watch and play video games with us? Do you have incredibly embarassing video tapes you made on your parents camera that you had the wherewithal to tape over a few years later after learning your shame? 
---
I'm so, so glad there is 0 digital and mostly photographic record of my actions between 8-13. It's hazy memory space for a reason. I feel bad for the little weirdos. I was a little shit playing online games too. Of course I didn't have an audience so I kept it together (mostly), but yeah. Rough being a kid in this weird age, I think.
---
its almost like they are earning money based off the number of people who click their links 
---
I mean lets not forget the near constant out rage since the game started - does the game need work I think we can all agree yes does it deserve the near non stop insanity its getting no its just a mmo and the first year is generally a crash test lets face it 
---
Valid question.
---
I'm just tired of how terrible this stat and perk system is. They managed to turn the perks into fucking cards. 
---
I figure its helps keep a level playing field for pvp ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
An additional skill point every 50 lvls or so would help.
---
I'd love a link, this sounds right up my alley.
---
It's funny how PvP players are the ones screaming for Nerfs, yet every PvP player you come across has TSE weapons and a full set of unyielding armor.
---
Yes. A couple of my friends thought I was playing at 3 am CST for 7 nights in a row
---
I am pretty sure it was because eb being eb were trying to upsell and only have the tricenial version on shelves, seeing as whenever i had gone to eb i only ever saw that version of f76
---
Been saying this since launch. Glad to see the community is turning around on this. For awhile the most common response was "git gud at wasteland inventory manager, bro" but it seems like people are finally seeing that spending 3-6 perk cards on weight management is just a bandaid for bad gameplay.
---
Workshops, Poseidon and Monongah power plants (I think) have crystal deposits 
---
I usually drop extra stuff in the overseer's stash in flatwoods when I get to that point. Chems, bulk junk, armor, weapons, plans, and recipes.  Figure it's quicker than looking for people online, and better than just dropping paper bags somewhere. 
---
There's a farm along the west river that you can claim. Has an extractor for both. And easy to defend (pvp not withstanding).
---
Yes. Sometimes she won‚Äôt drop anything at all. The extra XP was her gift I guess
---
That is truly frustrating!! There were several times when enemies suddenly spawned around me while I was deciding which perk card to use. They would kill me then to add insult to injury, I would get dropped from the server or the game would crash! I lost a TON of hard earned junk loot that way too many times.
---
I'll message u for stimpacks or any sort of alcohol tomorrow when I can be on
---
Yes, that was last night.  It is possible I somehow scrapped the frame, but I have no recollection of doing that.  I poached another frame today and put the pieces on it, seems fine.
---
Edit: PS4
---
Dabney Homestead is good for copper. It has 3 deposits and a Junk pile. If you take that, and Charleston Landfill which has 3 Junk and 1 copper you get a good amount of junk and copper.
---
You are ridiculous, predictable, and I'm just not interested. I've said my piece, I don't want to see politics in this subreddit for videogames. If you want to paint me into some bizarre fascist hate group whatever because of my flair then go for it. I know some people are very small and need to demonize those that disagree with them.

I'm hopping they'll drop a home DLC in the next year, let us remake a bunker or something- with chests that don't link to your overall CAMP weight. After all, we've been around Applachia for a while now, who wouldn't set down a more permanent homestead?
---
I have never gotten anything good from a scorched beast. I didnt even know u could
---
No I mean I get it about the random routes and all. Just mean when u see him, drop a line so others know where to look. That's all. Didnt know if there was something like that on here or I guess people just randomly may or may not drop in in this thread
---
Still you can get around 700 atoms per week if you play for 1hour daily focused on daily+weekly challenges.
---
Its only for the chest 
---
"Five finger discounts will be..." yea yea yea just show me what ya got
---
Yea I've seen videos of 3 star legendaries, and the musket that has 4 barrels
---
You don‚Äôt get legendary items from non-legendary enemies, like a scorchbeast. No one gets legendary items from scorchbeasts
---
Picklock,hacker would probably be the most helpful qol wise. Every high level has the perks but having to equip them is tedious.
---
I ran into some YouTuber being annoying as hell on the mic, so naturally I had to start blasting Ring of Fire on my mic. He hopped servers after 15 minutes of it. 
---
Right, and I have a Combat Armor chest that it doesn't show up in the list for. That's why I'm puzzled.
---
"Five finger discounts will be..." yea yea yea just show me what ya got.
---
seems to be a fair amount of twitch streams of it. https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fallout%2076
---
No doubt 
---
This game crashes now more than ever. 
---
Weird. Guess im unlucky then lol. The musket is called the dragon i think
---
A lot of the problem is the fact that your equipped perk cards don‚Äôt effect your stash. So I could have stuff on me that weighs like 5lbs but once i put it in my stash it takes up 20lbs instead of the 5 it did when i had it in my inventory. That‚Äôs my biggest frustration when it comes to weight management. 
---
Maybe if you have fast travel enabled, but those of us carrying 900 pounds after all carry weight mods are applied can't really go around taking 25 photos inside your grandmother's bathroom while wearing a deathclaw's liver on your head
---
I just died 
---
Don't normally see ftp applied to survival games and that is what FO76 is first and foremost.  It isn't like an mmo that fails to keep up subscriptions.
---
Since it is only cosmetics in the atom shop those cosmetics have to be really sought after and currently at best they're just ok and they are not even that many there.
---
Yeah I was annoyed as all hell about stash limit. So now I keep &lt;100 of rare items (adhesive, screws, gold) and &gt;200 of the basics (wood, steel, rubber). This allows me to keep my junk tamed but bountiful, with some space for unused ammo and a few legendaries 
---
Is it for heavy, medium or light combat armor? I think it's a different mod for each type.
---
Don't know why you were downvoted. It is just a key. You're receiving the same files on installation as someone who got a digital download.
---
Guess that concept kind of mystifies people. 
---
Compared to 3, 4 and NV, FO76 is much more based on the mechanics of the game rather than stories, so you can expect to feel like there are ‚Äúchores‚Äù.
---
As you level up, there will be perk cards which go some way to relieving the chores by doing things like making food and drink go further, things you carry become lighter and so on.  That said, they add the chore of managing the perk cards.
---
I recommend you spend at least some time in multiplayer mode, especially if you have a friend who is higher level.  If you injure an enemy and then your friend dies the killing, you also get XP for the kill.   I have a friend who built me a nice silenced long range rifle.  He flushes out high level opponents (because he‚Äôs high level), I pop off a sniper shot into as many as possible, hoping that I won‚Äôt attract attention (that‚Äôs why the suppressor is important) and he cleans them up.   Result is that we both get maybe 100+ XP points per kill, and I don‚Äôt die.
---
Look for railroad stations.  They have a vendor who may have 200 caps to buy stuff from you.  Also, stations have a ‚Äústash‚Äù box which allows you to access your stored stuff, and not have to carry it all to the vendor.  Once you‚Äôve relieved one vendor of his 200 caps, all other vendors in the same region will miraculously have their wealth reduced to the same level, so don‚Äôt invest caps in fast travel to stations unless you‚Äôre confident that the vendor still has caps..
---
Place your first C.A.M.P. in the Vault 76 general area where the opposition is low level.  I liked the pond near the lumber yard.  There‚Äôs water and wood in that area of course.
---
Take the perk which doubles your fruit, vege and plant picking returns.
---
If you have more steel (and other raw materials) than you need, don‚Äôt discard it.  Craft it into something and then scrap that something to get some stuff back and then rinse and repeat.  Gives you XP!
---
Don‚Äôt wander into dangerous areas carrying a load of valuable junk.  You may lose it.
---
If you want to transfer goodies between human players, don‚Äôt drop them on the ground.   Use the trade mechanism instead.  It‚Äôs less likely to end up disappearing forever.
---
Turrets use a disproportionate amount of CAMP ‚Äúbudget‚Äù.   Planting blackberries around your CAMP can deter and distract attackers, and can reduce the number if required turrets.
---
Play in ‚ÄúPacifist‚Äù mode.  It‚Äôs a player setting which means you can‚Äôt accidentally damage another player.
---
Don‚Äôt lockpick anything near a workshop area.  You may get a bounty on your head without realizing you‚Äôve sinned.
---
Hope this helps...
---
Wow those three stars really up the value! I sold a one star wood for 3 caps a few days ago.
---
And people are under no obligation to try to stay out of the line of fire of a TSE user. If they're killing themselves because of people in pacifist mode getting in the way (whether intentional or not) they can either exercise more caution or go farm somewhere else. 
---
Source?
---
If you're using reddit enhancement suite hover over a person's name and it'll give you the option to follow them along with a few other options. If you're using regular reddit or something else then no idea.
---
Again some fuckehead comparing $ to atoms lol. So gimme 20$ and i will let you spend 2k atoms i have still in deposit if something dope come out. Also you could give me 80$ for all atoms I got over time from playing.
---
It's a Heavy Gun, and under the Strength Special, you will find Heavy Gunner, Expert Heavy Gunner, etc.  The Stabilize Perk under INT (I think) is also helpful.
---
Ate you thinking of the scotch beast queen, the big boss of the whole game? Regular ones are notorious for dropping nothing but some meat and leather.
---
There's some kind of bug where both Marine and Combat armor dense mod are both called Dense Combat Armor.
---
Clever spot. I love this.
---
What is an LFG system?
---
You're almost certainly right about the check needing to find something amiss to actually make a difference. My hunch is that something got a wee bit corrupted for some of us. I've had the game installed since launch, so it's possible. 
---
Might be able to send it home with Animal whisperer 
---
There should be a visitors book that people can sign and leave messages for the owner.
---
But then again, that feature would probably get taken advantage of ;) 
---
Buy camo, let your armor look like spinach. Then buy hunting rifle camo, that have absolutly diferent colour set. haha, damn.
---
Whitesprings is still good without nuke for farming xp. I did it alot at lower lvl. I'd grab a submachine or auto pistol and tag as many ghouls as I could and run back to the whitesprings vendor entrance so the bots would engage and finish them off. Or jump on the ledge outside the pool , or shuttle bus beside tennis courts and shoot from where they cant reach you
---
If u search up fo76 50cal lmg the wiki should come up, and if u press more it will give u all perks and mods that affect it.
---
Hell, I am literally level 37, and my stash is 500ish out of 600.
---
Bethesda's never been good at roofs. 
---
I hope people leave me communism posters 
---
Why would you dupe salt? This is crazy!! 
---
It's heavy combat armor - if that's the case, then they \*really\* need to label which type of combat armor the plan applies to, I could have traded or sold that one.
---
you say this like you're championing a positive announcement. if it's not going free to play then pulling games from the shelves means it's literally selling so bad retailers are getting refunds from bethesda.
---
Nope they were small ones in unnuked areas
---
That‚Äôs just a bad RNG roll bud. To get more good stuff you have to make more rolls. You will get stuff you don‚Äôt want, but statistics and infinite probability dictates that you will eventually get something good. It‚Äôs just like gambling. It‚Äôs just like any RNG based loot game. You gotta get lucky. 
---
That being said, take a moment for self reflection. Are you certain you‚Äôre not just looking for excuses to hate Bethesda and/or the game itself? It may be that you aren‚Äôt fully enjoying the game, and that‚Äôs ok. You don‚Äôt need a valid reason to dislike it, nor do you need a valid reason to enjoy it. Instead of allowing that hate to consume you, I‚Äôd recommend focusing more on doing things that you do enjoy. That way you‚Äôll be happier in the long run. (You don‚Äôt have to listen to me. My advise may not even be relevant. I‚Äôm basing my thoughts purely on your word choice and tone. I don‚Äôt know you, and won‚Äôt presume to understand what you‚Äôve got going on. Just sharing my thoughts.)
---
Whatever you choose, I hope you make the best of it. Have a good one!
---
I sadly was not in the possession of this perk.
---
Something like that
---
Oi vey. I'll log in tomorrow and see if I can find a Marine chest to check this out on. Thanks for the tip.
---
I feel like tank killer is also useful for a heavy weapon as well. 
---
See them in Watoga. If you are on PC i can give you revolver
---
No there have been people getting legendaries from them, I don't remember the videos, and I believe most were on Instagram
---
I could get down with that
---
Im on ps4 i just didnt know what vendors to check. Thanks!
---
I have a few sets of unyielding but its a mis matched 1-2 star.  Id kill for the 15 percent less damage while sprinting and unyielding.  I seriously had 15 extra 1 stars i gave away from white springs runs and scraps other people left behind.  
---
seeing someone with explosive weapons and pvp does make me giddy at the start.   The panic when you get 2 inches away from them is worth it.
---
Western - pleasant peak, both station and Vendorbot Resin in the resort. It isn‚Äôt common, I sell to them all the time and I don‚Äôt often see it.
---
.44 - Maybe Sutton?(Checked my notes, Sutton for sure, seen it a lot there) I know I see it in Lewisburg and other Responder vendors. 
---
Single action -  Not sure about this one. Mentally it‚Äôs a low priority so I didn‚Äôt remember where. Pretty sure I have seen it. I don‚Äôt want to guess and steer you wrong.
---
Do we ever get communication back when /u/LoneVaultWanderer says that?
---
Oh I agree, they definitely need to up their mod description game.
---
They weren‚Äôt dude. The only legendary scorchbeast is the scorchbeast queen. The game doesn‚Äôt hate you, you‚Äôre just looking for legendary gear in the wrong spot
---
Thank you!
---
I devote none of my perk cards towards carry capacity since the last stash bump. I really dont need to since I just bulk and sell things I dont need. One needs a little more self control, which isnt always easy, but its possible. 
---
I wish more people would do that on PC!
---
[This is just example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCkgvFwFAVw) (I am european and new challenges starts near mignight so at working dayis, i cant make this videos, bcos it would be late anyway). 80% Of those challenges are doable in flatwoods, You could make new character to do atleast part of them daily. But i dont know, if you need carry 900lbs of trash you will never use, um, ok.
---
A poor man‚Äôs made out of muscle and blood
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
Ha!  I'm an idiot.  I found it now.  Thanks, friend.  
---
I've been doing that, since my camp is right across the water from the overseers camp, but I'm nowhere near my camp rn.
---
Infuriating protest sign.  10% chance to berserk enemy.
---
I was intending to make shine, and was excited by the stills I found, but alas no plans, no recipes, and no booze.  My biggest disappointment with the game so far, but I hope that will change one day.
---
 But did you remember to dump Lone Wanderer for The deal one? 
---
That's not how physical game copy distribution works. 
---
You realize that pacifist mode has absolutely nothing to do with this situation, right? All it does is prevent THEM from attacking YOU in return. Even with pacifist turned off, if they jump in front of you they'll still only take slap damage and you'll still take your full splash damage.  
---
In fact, if they turned pacifist mode off it would be even more advantageous to them because in the event that your explosive weapon didn't take yourself out completely, they would have an opportunity for the first hit with full damage enabled in order to finish you off. Then they can loot you and server hop to prevent retaliation. Again, pacifist mode has nothing to do with this, it's the slap damage system.  
---
At least learn how the basic mechanics of gameplay work before you complain about them. 
---
All that means is that your weapons aren't doing enough damage. ;)
---
I did the same quest at level 15. Here‚Äôs what I did to keep me from dying: 
---
1. Check the map beforehand to make sure there aren‚Äôt any high level people nearby. It‚Äôs not a guarantee but it can help. If Whitesprings is a nuke zone, it‚Äôs going to be a no-go. 
---
2. SNEAK. And I am talking SNEAK. Take drugs, pick your best sneaking perk cards. Do whatever you can to stay hidden. If you have a cloaking device, definitely use it.
---
3. After you open up the case, grab that sucker and RUN. Get to where the robots are. The goal is to book it out of there like it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business.
---
Mutual pvp, nobody has to be wanted though, so what if you lose all your caps, and you aren't wanted? Do you still get the debuff?
---
To be completely honest that was one major reason i stopped playing. Got to 62 levels before I just got tired of always going through inventory.  Like others have said to, in FO we hoard most supplies or weapons/armor we know we won't use but want to keep around for the collector in us buy noooo you can't do that here. Could having unlimited stash space affect game servers? I don't know, I'm not a game designer but they really need to evaluate how they're going to fix that.
---
phresh 
---
Anybody tried giving them away at vault 76? Imaging handing them out to a bunch of new players, who might sign up for the protest just for protection.
---
 They are around. I have some near my higher level's CAMP. They show up quite a lot there.
---
Na not really. My friends and I will nuke some random place but it always sucks.
---
Watoga high monster mash is by far the best way. It repeats 3 times. Then you can server hop and start it again. Not to mention at least one legendary enemy per go.
---
Which is a pain in the ass if you want to trade with him.
---
Yep, great target practice for my TSE lever action.
---
Time for the ribeye steak/ grilled radstag and buffout!
---
Is it an event?
---
I literally player.setav carryweight 999 in every Fallout game.
---
1 hour maybe but probly in a years time
---
Downvoted for talking about black magic.
---
What'd ya get?
---
This would be a fun way for professionals to practice sales pitches lol
---
Just bellow deeply
---
thats how physical everything distribution works.
---
Players have "been the content" in games for years and years. It isn't a new gaming frontier. At all.
---
get the starched genes perk :)
---
Awh that sucks!  I‚Äôd sacrifice some orphans for s kitten at base
---
Perceptive! But yes I did remember.
---
I collect plenty I just collect better than you. Lear what‚Äôs important to you
---
That was just condensation, not rain. ;)
---
This game is too limiting. I literally have to ignore missile launchers because they weight too damn much. In a perfect world I‚Äôd be fooling around with a missile launcher all the time 
---
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
---
I heard apparently it only consumes all ammo on the first shot, now that it has, that head is safe to use for you.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khFkNsBbmAQ Surprised this never found it's way into the game.
---
Actually no bluegrass did. Which disappoints me still
---
I saw a normal cute little puppy, he was on a cliff chilling with some skeletons on a couch, probably past owners
---
A physical copy is treated very differently than a digital copy when it comes to the law / consumer rights.  There is actually a really big difference between the two even if the content is the same.
---
If you want Grahm you can force his spawn. You have to capture the Sunshine work Shop. The one where you make package food. You capture it and defended it. Then after you have Captured it. You stay at the workshop and after the 3rd or 5th defend of the workshop Grahm will spawn on the road by it.
---
I don‚Äôt cause it takes 30 mins to and hour to force him to spawn.
---
A mind that's a weak and skin that's strong
---
You can actually get raider power armor starting at level 15.
---
This happened to me on PS4 yesterday. Some asshole named todd_toddington had a high ass bounty and destroyed me and my CAMP with his TSE machine gun. It really sucked. The bobble head glitching needs to end 
---
Wait, you can silence a pipe revolver?
---
Hahaha love it!  Too bad I‚Äôm on PC (and out of town)
---
Love Fallout 76 but the majority of landmarks and named places are not accurate in appearance nor placement. One thing they did get spot on was the landscape and the rolling mountains though.
---
No one has to humble brag. 
---
I liked coming across someone's missile camp because I had never been in a nuke zone before and was running from like 10 things chasing me. I assumed someone heard me going "Crap...Crap!! Crap!!!!" and was helping then I realized it was a building. 
---
Yes, absolutely. The gameplay as a whole seems to be more geared towards power armour melee builds anyway, imo, and the sheer amount of carry weight issues rifleman builds experience is ridiculous. Plus I find it absolutely unfair pistols and melee weapons are the ONLY weapon classes that get weight reduction perks; my fully modded lever action weighs more than some heavy weapons, and a full mod pump shotty weighs even more. I have 9 points in Strength on my stealth sniper character totally dedicated to weight reduction. That's friggin' ridiculous. I shouldn't need more than 6, MAYBE. And even with all the weight reduction stuff, I've spent the last 4 weeks exploiting a power armour glitch just to be able to move, and the last week completely overencumbered. There needs to be some kinda balance patch; I'd prefer a global weight reduction so we aren't hurting on all aspects, but that's wishful thinking. I think a far more reasonable option would be to just give every player an extra 50 carry weight, or let weight reduction perks affect the Stash on top of the player, that way I don't have to carry every single grenade and ballistic ammo just so I can store my junk.
---
 Well mine was one star too, but obviously a much better piece. At least the prices reflect their value. ;) 
---
MAKE THE SMART CHOICE! 
---
Reduced carry weight of aid and junk could also be passive perks. The stronger and more agile you are the less things should weigh you down. 
---
I feel it should be able to be done at our camps by nature springs and screws and fears aren‚Äôt that complicated to make
---
Crystal - Tarangra Town, as you climb you pass through a cave. In there.
---
Honestly, I've found herbivore to be **much** better than carnivore in this game. Especially with speed demon
---
I've got a bunch of tato, corn, carrots, etc growing at my camp. Full food bar available at a moment's notice. No prep work required. Never have to try and find anything. Easy peasy. 
---
Sure, carnivore feels cooler, but until the game lets me raise and eat Brahmin, it's just more trouble than it's worth. 
---
I‚Äôve seen him three times since I‚Äôve been playing. Two times he was going south on the road near Hillfolk Hotdogs, the other he was just east of WV lumber company. These were all early in the game, probably in the span of a week. Haven‚Äôt seen him again since.
---
this is definatly the problem i guarentee it will be the marine chest mod that you have learned i did the same thing i have only found the dense mod for combat armor not the actual plan yet ...besides the wrongly named one of course
---
Really? Because when I get into excavator power armor, it adds 100 pounds to my already increased carry weight due to my deep pocketed mods
---
There's a path leading into a cavern under Tanagra Town up in the giant tree in the Mire, the caves inside are lined with crystal and gold deposits. Bring Excavator armor and you can gather dozens of pieces to smelt per trip. Much faster than workshops.
---
Shitting on the latest Fallout game while praising the previous one you were just shitting on is literally the Fallout Fandom circle of life.  When FO5 is released I promise you people will be talking about how innovative and risk taking FO76 was while the shit on 5.
---
He is thinking of the scorchbeast queen. The game literally does not spawn legendary scorchbeast
---
that is all she drops
---
You‚Äôre like a dyptheria dyson, you should be proud!
---
Furious Troubleshooters 40% faster swing speed
---
74 pics? Man, you just missed it :P
---
Not unlucky, regular schorchbeasts don‚Äôt drop legendaries
---
Seriously im into fallout since '98 and we always dreamed about how cool it would be to be able to run as a group in First Person. My wildest dreams didnt look as nice as Fo76. 
---
&gt; I'm really tired of taking half hour breaks to offload all my crap onto alts
---
Wood armor have best stealth mod. It is better than shadowed combat. Also you could do this with 15agi. If you wanna min/max get bird bones (4agi) shielded raider underarmor (3agi) all pieces with better sneak legendary effect, (maybe chameleon if you stay on place, they will not spot you, but you dont see ironsight then, annoying shit)
---
No, dude, he *is* a white supremacist. Literally. The fact that his gaming opinions are as brain-dead as his political opinions is completely incidental.
---
Yeah, I know people are just gonna people, but I wish they'd either own it or gain a little empathy, not this self deluding, "That's just what my guy would do!," like they have no control over their toon. Just, be a little more honest *or* a little nicer.
---
Anyway, I think it would have been helpful if Beth had put an arena in 76, and given people the opportunity to win legendaries that way. I guarantee even PvEers like me would try it out. Or PvEers could ignore it and simply forgo any legendaries benefit they might gain from it. I don't view the game as competitive so I don't care if other players have 'better' equipment, as long as I can still hold up my end of a group fight. 
---
I only lick my bedroom in my camp, and have a matching unlocked guest room.
---
Ah, a new character as in just to do all the running around. Yeah that would probably help
---
What I would like is a version of FO4, where in addition to safe-stashing ur 600 lbs, u can also stash in risky places like trash cans, etc w some  percent expectation of getting it back - maybe based on luck perks. 
---
I agree you got what you wanted. I wasn't complaining about the gift. I was just asking a question about how to fill out the form.
---
I ***think*** you can get them from Patrol Duty.  I believe that's where I got them.
---
Noob.
---
You'll note, if you read properly, that I said, "One of the reasons". Clearly the crap loot is the other main reason, along with the fact that you lose the work-shop on log-off or disconnect and the high cap price to start with - as I've stated in previous comments. 
---
FYI: People who start comments with LMAO, aren't laughing - they're being defensive because they feel upset. 
---
The work-shop system and what you call 'end-game players' (i.e. bored jerks who cyber-bully because they have no life) are two of the biggest problems in the game. Fortunately bounty-hunters sort the shit-bags out pretty quickly. 
---
Yes, how selfish of people not to accept your need to ruin the enjoyment of the rest of us.
---
As I already said - if you've played the game through and you are bored with it, the standard normal behaviour is to play another game. Try Red Dead 2.
---
Bethesda has got your money and you've finished playing. You're done. Bethesda need to look after the rest of us and ensure new players are looked after, not hunted down by bored Griefers. 
---
Can you link proof to your claims?
---
It‚Äôs been buggy for me as well (I know I‚Äôve picked followers on the list). Earlier posts today made it seem like people were also having this issue. 
---
Nah we wear x01 and run melee 
---
I think the chandeliers were from 4. Maybe creation club content. 
---
What the fuck, queen is always 95lvl 3\*. Sometimes diseazed with radiation aura.
---
huh, that IS real interesting.
---
I am also curious about this, because I got one off of the Super Mutant and I absolutely love using it, except it came with a couple mods, so I would like a stock one
---
 I just did this. They are available from level 15 to level 20 at Watoga Station and from Wallace at Harper's Ferry. 
---
 We need a name for the Watoga Station Bot BTW.
---
I just came here to say that I saw him yesterday walking through Whitespring while it was nuked.  I know that doesn't help, but I thought it was odd to see him walking through an active nuked area.  His timing was impeccable though as I was able to offload a bunch of heavy crap!
---
Birdbones gives +4agi
---
Yeah you just have to walk into watoga high school to start it. If it doesnt then go to another server and walk into the highschool again. Also, Be careful as you can attack and be attacked by players wearing the monster mask (youll know what I mean when you get in there and start doing it). Good luck!
---
Yes, I always welcome intellectual comments from the local 11 year olds.
---
It's a game. Deal with it and stop whining.
---
I think they're OP but I use explosive so I can defend myself equally from others with it
---
I think someone already pointed out there's a bug:
---
Plan: Dense Combat Armor is for Marine armor.
---
Plan: Dense Combat Armor is for Combat armor.
---
..... right. They're identical. It's annoying.
---
The ammo crafting in FNV should have been a stepping stone for F4 and 76, but they dumbed it down instead.
---
Yeah. 
---
I mean, putting that many hours into just about any game in the span of 2-3 months is going to see you hit a content wall. 
---
With RPGs it almost always means farming, replaying events or raids. 
---
I actually had less time to give 76 than I originally expected (Rocket League still reigns in my house) and I'm glad about it. 
---
It's meant I've still invested a fair chunk of hours into a few different characters, and still have plenty of the game to experience. 
---
When they are in air, they are super tanky. Which is fucking anoying becouse regular SBs dont land ever. Also they have high explosive rezistances, thats why you dont hit them hard. And he is around 500damage with nice fire rate.
---
 The redoubtable Phoenix in Watoga sold me mine. Forget the rest, the Revolver is what you want. Just sold The Voice of Set. ;) 
---
There are 4 cooking recipes this happens on.  As far as I know those 4 recipes are simply bugged.  I've never seen it happen with anything else though.
---
I go down from 280 to 235. But my power armor is a mutt: some T45, some raider &amp; some excavator. Does that make a difference? 
---
I got the red 10 cap thing in the corner of my screen 
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why no one gets this. 
---
Distant thunder, my knees give out, blue and green to death
---
THIS IS AMAZING.
---
It has been for years, but I'm always delighted to find them *still fucking playing* after all this time.
---
Plus, a lot of 'em speak English and are happy to have another head for clan PvP. I had a lot of fun with one group for a few weeks, last time I booted it up. I forget their names, but I remember they would all say to me "you will like so much playing with us!" which I thought was really endearing. 
---
 You can sell most of that. Got too many caps?
---
If only you were on PC. Our first encounter would be a bit like that double Spider Man meme, possibly followed by bonding over a meal of strange meat on the patio of my ~~kill house~~ cliffside bungalow.
---
You're a little too insistent, my friend. I have a feeling that bag will be full of clown poo...
---
Miles out of weapons is right 
---
Are you sure those aren't videos of killing the scorchbeast Queen? I've probably killed 30 or 40 scorchbeasts and I've never found a legendary or anything really worthwhile.
---
I only kill them if there's nowhere quick to duck into or their spamming me with their attacks. Never for the loot just to make em dead.
---
I've seen him maybe half the times I've held the dirt track workshop for a while...
---
 I'm puzzled. I make most of my money selling water, stimpacks, food and weapons and armor to the various bots who trade.
---
 I thought everyone operated like this. It allows me to buy maybe 600 - 1200 worth of plans mostly, but also armor and stuff for my CAMP.
---
maybe instead it just equips the power fist as the right arm... you lose some of your protection at the cost of having your melee?
---
Yeah I gotta second this unless someone edited together a video to make it look like that kind of loot was falling from regular scorchbeasts there's no way they drop anything good with any frequency that makes it worthwhile.
---
I was happy to get a couple stimpacks from the one I took down tonight.
---
Bobby pins show up as 0 weight for me after the last patch üëç
---
It would great if the weight reduction perks applied to your stash too...
---
Yea, I scratch my head at the number of threads and posts we have around here that have no understanding of the system.  
---
It literally works just like real life. If you're a pacifist then you don't want to/won't hurt others. But it doesn't stop them from hurting you. The sameeeee exact way it works in the game, lmao.  
---
Yeah it's the only revolver you can do it with which is a shame.
---
https://imgur.com/a/xRLtTUt
---
Uhhh wood armour is the new meta....
---
Sure, ask away! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for.
---
I scrapped Shielded raider underamor (which i cant craft and i bought it from ppl) 3 fucking times in few weeks, becouse lags after killing queen. I am just scraping, boom lag, my menu hops and i scrap underarmor i am wearing. Now my ass is naked again.
---
I'll bet firing it once uses all the fusion cells on the server. ;-)
---
Lol thanks. I was upset more that they took the servers down than anything else.  I enjoyed it :P
---
Dirt track workshop, you say? 
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve found that one ü§î
---
Get to level 50 or stop building turrets, turrets eat a ton of budget for each one you have, also quit worrying so much about junk.
---
Idk how he works but I think he despawns if left unattended for too long... I've seen him in some weird places though... Like deer paths and whitespring... He is also known to like at least a bunch of the workshops. 
---
... you shouldn't be able to suppress them at all. 
---
Oh yeah for sure. You need to have a full time xcavator suit to get the bonus carry weight. And none of the 6 pieces can be broken 
---
So basically.....
---
I‚Äôm 255 capacity with no pocketed armor
---
305 with full deep pocketed armor
---
And 450 with deep pocketed armor and wearing excavator 
---
So I obviously am getting the carry weight boosted from both the deep pocketed and the excavator at the same time
---
If you were hogging a bunch of Whitespring mobs by one-shotting them you probably deserved it :p
---
Its multiple layers of rng.
---
Someone with 10p hours could have a couple drop.
---
Rngesus is fickle like that.
---
If your set on shotguns, can't blame you I'm addicted to em, Anti-Armor with +Limb Damage is probably going to be top for that weapon. If you're comfortable sitting low health then Bloodied +Limb Damage.  I'd keep that TSE shotty for clearing the silos, especially mainframe destruction section.
---
If he was in the Watoga faction he'd share the same cap pool as the RR station.  I think it's cool he's the last remnant of the BoS in the area.
---
After playing online RPGs, and competitive multiplayer games for over 20 years. Yes I honestly believe that disabling a half assed pvp mode would do more good than it would hurt for the game.
---
Having a pvp server, or character option would be fine, but forcing everyone to pvp is foolish and it will turn people away.
---
What u find pathetic is your inability to contribute to a conversation without resorting to school yard insults. I've mentioned plenty of alternatives, and I am willing to have a discussion on the topic at hand. It is you who has commented with childish insults because I don't enjoy the game in it's current state.
---
The game can be balanced, and I could see the pvp being fun given the right circumstances, but in its current state it is only fun for griefers, which given the way you comment I have a feeling that is the reason why you enjoy it so much. Grow up.
---
He said pass as in, too expensive
---
Part of the weekly code for launching a nuke, yeah.
---
I wear 4 unyielding legendary armor, and I have the perk Radicool. Stacked with nerd rage and adrenal reaction, I'm getting insane boosts to my stats. Perception: 31, Strength: 18, Luck and Agility: 27, etc. Hitting 526 with my Gauss doing +123% Critical damage and 3.5x sneak at night. You just have to manage low health, but as a stealth build it's not too hard. You also get to share level 3 perk cards. 
---
I‚Äôve got no idea why anyone thought that was gonna happen. Is there ANY past examples of a 60 dollar game going FTP within 6 months of its release?
---
Between vault 76 and that lumberjack is little lake. If you head there downhill from vault, there is spawn of random (cat,frog,rabbit,.....) critcket or how to spell it on left side of it. I server hop there when i have daily challenge to kill some of these. Becouse they are random i think you can also tame them?
---
There is a mod for perk swapping on the nexus. It's working great for me.
---
You are the reason my brother and I bought it finally and im pretty happy so far
---
The idea was so funny I wish I got roasted there 
---
Yeah, you have your say...I shouldn't be allowed to have mine. Common of your ilk. 
---
Oh MAN would I love to be able to trade in perk cards. I have some dupes that are just useless for my build. Still below lv50, so the right perks are hard to land with shit like three dromedaries or 2x expert hacker.
---
Lucky hole mine has tons and tons of crystal... Wear a full suit of excavator armor and I think you get a bonus to mining... Not sure tho, never tried it. 
---
For copper idk, I've always had plenty from junk so I never hunted down a good spot for it. 
---
My point being, Two players with pacifist mode on in this situation, still give rise to people being able to kill someone if they feel like it
---
It's up near the Ferris Wheel on the map. There's a bunch of deposits on that shop, though I was only interested in it for the junk pile (It's not a heavily contested workshop so it's an easy hold)
---
Defend the shop events are also stupid easy and quick. Because the bench is inside the dirt track that has few entrances you can just stand in the middle and pick things off as they come through.
---
Its become a hobby of mine whenever i farm for power armor pieces or fusion cores i grab every lvl 15 raider piece and once i get a full set i find a low level to gve it too. Given away 4 so far and the reaction makes it great.
---
Dude, there's a guy that just posted that after 450 hours he got his first tse.
---
I‚Äôve seen him near my camp twice, and I‚Äôm set up right across the river from Poseidon, nestled into a high rise that somehow allows camp placement lol. 
---
I‚Äôve seen him up near 76 too though. 
---
I just kinda assume he walks a set route and if you know it it might be easier to bump into him
---
Marie Kondo would know what to do. 
---
Oh again you, lol.
---
Not to mention, strength at 18 plus Radicool puts my carry capacity at 270, which is incredibly easy to manage. 
---
In other corporate news telltale games was hiring right up until they went out of business.
---
Usually the vendors run out of caps.
---
It sucks cause I've tried that too.  But It REALLLLY sucks cause it's a constant thing.  Hopefully a patch will fix it.  I've tried everything I can think of.  Sprinting helps for about 2 seconds.  Then it's back to being slower then an overweight super mutant with a jet addiction 
---
That's gotta be it, I find lead pipes all the time and scrap 'em for lead. Wasn't paying enough attention I guess
---
[Just die few times.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYJdTfE7N_M)
---
I get not getting an additional boost without a full excavator, but to go DOWN when getting into power armor doesn't make sense to me. My carry weight in my power armor is the same as it with or without my deep pocketed leather armor. 
---
Still feels stale to me, and I don't know wtf is up with that pink bed but 18 people giving thumbs up to the post above me is the reason why it exists. xD  
---
The column would be ok if we could place stuff on it, but I heard that's not possible. The light is decent looking but not really \~interesting\~ in any way, and the chandelier just looks weird.
---
Overall, it's great to see more things showing up at once. Hopefully that continues. But if the new stuff looks like this I'm just gonna feel more alienated and bored than excited haha. 
---
Thanks for the shares OP.  
---
I‚Äôll have to go look. 
---
I think I‚Äôve been near the Ferris wheel but before I knew what workshops were about. 
---
Dirt track sounds cool... especially if it had junk piles 
---
Most of the people I've run into doing this have been the 12 year olds.
---
I got my explosive combat shotgun from them.
---
I don't remember the last time i got wood
---
Yes, but in its current state is making the game a chore. 
---
At the rate equipment breaks down and with the requirements to make new items, you're basically left returning to your base to stash junk constantly. 
---
This, coupled with the already horribly small stash, means we load up on junk we need later and have no room to store weapons. There's no desire to grab heavy guns that I might want to use later, because I absolutely can not afford to keep them stashed. It's stifling. You need to find the balance between gameplay mechanics and letting people have fun
---
This is not the fucking trade forum. 
---
You find and collect those for each solo. You need them to decrypt the launch codes for the final mission. They reset weekly.
---
I made a 10mm machine gun just to get rid of my 3k ammo. Ashame we cant sell ammo or the only thing id have is 5mm and 556
---
Mmm. The mid century modern chandelier. 
---
It's already hanging in my home and looking fabulous. 
---
If your stash is full, clear some stuff out to make room, so you can drop all of your junk in your stash. Then you lose nothing when you die.
---
Most people keep a LOT of stuff they don't *really* need in their stash box. My wife has 53 beer bottles, 4 broken armor chest pieces, and a ton of concrete, glass, and other rarely needed crafting components. She never learns to clear out the stuff she doesn't need.
---
yeah it is.....But I still believe I should be eligible for 3star items from the SBQ guaranteed. In mmo's there is still rng but you complete an end game event and you get something "Good" maybe not good for your toon but it IS good for someone. Not a 1 star nocturnal wood chest armour................@_@ 
---
I think it has a junk, multiple silver, steel (I think), and aluminum.
---
Enlighten me then.
---
Chappy
---
Calm your shit
---
My camp is almost in the opposite position on the map from Vault 76 (near the asylum), so I always have a free fast travel in the northwest and southeast. I'm surrounded by all the faction vendors, only harper's ferry costs more than 15 caps to fast travel. Going to the ne or sw corners of the map cost a bit more, but I hardly ever go there anyway.
---
I think it's worth noting, given you mention the toy thing...I scrap a LOT of toys, so on a raid I checked my before scrap and after scrap rad resistance...zero change. That thing never worked for me the entire week.   
---
Feeding player-sold goods into factions to establish a market price based on scarcity would be a interesting (read: fascinating) way to avoid the stash limit. The faction vendors are already a defecto monopoly, so I could see a reasonable compromise in being able to choose to sell limited amounts for the vendor-approved price or unlimited amounts at the floating market rate.
---
 Yes. The care and feeding of the vendor network is an esoteric art indeed. ;) Once I suck em' all dry the other end usually starts to recover.
---
There's fun to be had and I've had a lot of fun with my friends over the past couple months.  The community in general is great despite the busted economy.  I still enjoy playing for the most part as it's the only new fallout we will get outside of the amazing mod community on Fallout 4.. but, let's be real, this could have spent another year or so in dev and have ideas fleshed out and technical woes sorted before peddling this to the masses for full price.   
---
In this version of the game, there is no end game or engaging activities to do as a group when you all hit the upper echelons of levels.   Why even have healing weapons and healing perks when monsters die so easily anyways?  Why would you go hunt the scorch beast queen for legendary weapons/armor when some random three star ghoul has the same chance at those weapons/armor (yes, I know there are extras on the queen like serum plans... but why not put unique and amazing weapons on a raid boss?).
---
Stuff like that alongside the critical reception of this game doesn't smell like success to me... now, if you'll excuse me.. I'm gonna have to go take a chance on these plans at Watoga and hope to Todd I don't know them already.  
---
He isn‚Äôt running away; he is advancing in a different direction.  You need to learn srategery.
---
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
---
This guy is legit! I won 3rd place
---
The only way it has a future is if they put in the work it was supposed to have from the beginning and not a half assed fallout product with a fallout setting but with  I reason to keep playing it for the adventure like an actual flour game. I keep stressing the importance of actual meaningful characters and choice while you explore not fucking holotapes. It's clear they have the voice acting but why skimp out of actual fallout elements is beyond me. They shouldn't have released the product in such a state its their own fault and if they want the good will back they must finish what they started at a cost to them in hope it will bring more money in the future. 
---
Oh yeah you‚Äôre right. I just got into my ultracite armor Instead and I went down from 305 to 250! Sorry it was literally my first time not wearing excavator. So I guess excavator is the only one that doesn‚Äôt negate the carry bonus from deep pocketed! 
---
People thought the game was going f2p? I guess I live under a rock.
---
That gun is probably the only reason that I survived the Savage devide.
---
Leather Coat, Traveling Leather Coat and Tattered Field Jacket.
---
Almost impossible to get in 76
---
If you put all your fusion cells in your stash. Then shoot it once, it will be unglitched until it leaves your bag again 
---
With or without perks, humans aren't really hard to kill kill and usually get overkilled with 3 shots, so the perks don't make much of a difference in pvp but a whooole lot in pve because pve enemies are really bullet spongy
---
Hey man yeah I've nuked lots of different places to try it out. I went through a stage where I would drop 3 nukes on the prime site and server hop then do it again lol. Its funny they give you the option to nuke where ever you like but there really is only a couple of choices
---
toys make the best shotgun shells, if for no other reason than the irony itself.
---
I'm pretty sure it has to do with the fact that if you could use them in tandem your power level would exceed 9000.
---
I don't think there's any evidence that he's in the world permanently. In fact I've seen the opposite.
---
Was defending the airport and he pops in. I get excited and go to my stash to get a few things to sell and turn around go up to him and he just vanished. Thought it might have been like a lag issue so looked around the area and nothing.
---
My guess is that he spawns in randomly within certain areas then hangs around for a little while and then despawns.
---
I see. So I have to optimize the guns physical damage and not explosive damage. Interesting I'll try that. 
---
Weird, right? Maybe after all the mission-breaking bugs, they'll get to these types of things... I'll hold my breath. 
---
i think u can tame them. now i want either a chicken or a frog in my camp as a pet.
---
How much for bos combat arms, nuka paint, and do you have excavator vats?
---
What am I looking at...
---
With all the bottles in this game, why are there no craftable broken bottles to use as weapons. Hell, let people throw bottles too. Filled bottles can have the added effect of drunkening opponents. Ghouls already walk like they‚Äôre drunk, imagine them actually drunk.
---
 I like that. ;) I talk to em', I admit it.
---
Well that‚Äôs unfortunate if true. 
---
I kinda like the idea of him being a persistent dude
---
Part of the problem is pathing; they need better circuits.
---
If they have to honestly see how increasing the stash limit affects their server performance. Then a few people need to resign in disgrace.
---
Well if they fix anything they‚Äôll just change the excavator to work like all the other armors but keep the 100 pound bonus so I end up with 350 total
---
I do like the shotgun but probably most interested in rifle or something.
---
I‚Äôm interested in BOS Combat arms as well
---
GT wonderpuddle25 
---
What do you mean joke? I would take Jeff Gardiner in the mouth, to completion, for a 1000lb stash and perks to level 60
---
500 caps for arms and Nuka paint 1,000 caps and no on Excavator vats.
---
I mostly agree but limited time story progress? What about players that join after such time period and get on the second week they wouldn't know what the event is about if they didn't play the first part.
---
500 Caps Message me Gt themisterphenix 
---
This is... amazing. You've cataloged everything that makes this game so much fun and captured it with photos.
---
Where'd you get the outfit from the fourth photo? I'm sure it's early game but I just can't seem to remember what it's called/where to find it. 
---
Congrats on winning!
---
yeah...Multi-player games with PVP elements which rely entirely upon random chance for the only truly competitive items in the game are fucking idiotic, not gonna lie.   
---
I enjoy me some first person shooter content. I've played more tf2 than I care to admit. I will \_never\_ participate in PVP in this game, and this is one of the best examples why...some people find explosive two shot 50 cal machine guns. So far, after many, many hours in nuke zones and farming legendary spawn spots...my best gun is a suppressing explosive pump I bought off a vendor. The VERY BEST gun I've looted personally is a furious assault rifle...level 30.   
---
This is a \_stupid\_ way to run a PVP game. 
---
Check your T levels man
---
Cool thanks man
---
At first this degenerated bat shatters my armor with his sonic fuckery &amp; now even the armor workbench! :/
---
Food and water are important. 
---
It's easy to keep purified water/soup/food on you always.
---
When hunger and thisrt are low it negatively impacts things like your Action Points
---
When they are nearly full you get a well fed &amp; Quenched buff.
---
If your lower level, stick to the green portion of the map and redo a few events, easy quick exp. 
---
How's your armour situation?
---
961 a shot is good enough for me lol
---
Thanks for that
---
&gt;didn‚Äôt even kill the robot I was aiming at. 
---
Did you hit it? From what I've heard it does deal the damage for each cell and could be used to one shot the Queen.
---
Been wondering if there's any truth to that. 
---
What's with all the vendor shit today? There's a trade forum, take this garbage there. 
---

Lost X01 calibrated shocks mod to fast traveling back to my camp. Purchased the mod, traveled to whitesprings station. Put mod in my stash at stash box at the station. Finished my business and went back to my camp via fast travel. Went to my stash and it's gone!!!
---
I've had as many as three in one circuit, and there are more inside buildings... Most days I get zero. 
---
Unless I'm missing something the attackers really didnt do anything.  When I'm solo I just accept that 3 dudes in PA will take over the workshop if they want.  I also assume anyone openly engaging in PvP, particularly a group of anyones, has at least one TSE among them.
---
Lately I've been running into people who take a public workshop I own and log out the instant they get it.  This to me is being a jerk about PvP: attempt to force PvP by taking workshop, take workshop with no incident, immediately leave server.  Now the workshop is unowned and both I reclaiming the workshop and the people attempting to force PvP threw a bunch of caps in a hole and neither of is have anything to show for it.
---
I saw a chicken last week. I guess they're immune to nuclear mutations...

Someone did a map, and it's pretty much every road in the wasteland.

Thanks again! And it was fun playing with you guys last night
---
Based on...? 
---
And how would you rebuild America? 
---
It's not deep lore based stuff. Kill (this mob) to get (this drop) and week two, a terminal comes online somewhere that accepts this code that says "go to (location whatever) to kill the source/boss.
---
I mean sure people might miss out, but that's the nature of these kinds of events. In The Division, you'd have events where killing certain mobs with certain kinds of weapons earned points to buy certain specific loot crates, and if you took a few weeks off, well do your best but maybe save those credits for the next event and use them for that event's new loot crate.
---
Was it a legendary? Because I've never gotten a legendary from a NON legendary mob in this game. 
---
My favorite part of the game is giving others a hand.
---
What a crappy idea ;-)
---
Nope. Sorry. We're all Enclave Generals headed for the moon.
---
I understand your point I just don‚Äôt like people blaming it on pacifist mode when it‚Äôs not relevant. As someone who uses a TSE it‚Äôs really easy to blow yourself up. Take extra precautions and stop blaming other players for taking advantage of a broken weapon. 
---
Please make the paper bag you drop when you die glowing or something(only to its original owner)so it‚Äôs not so damn hard to find.  Also be nice if it is locked and inaccessible to other players( for 3 minutes or so) if your death not inflicted by other players.  
---
Also, one time I died to some enemies and when I came back there were meat piles everywhere and on top of my bag!!!  I was not able to get to my bag because the enemies were killed by another player.  He/she later ended taking my bag after he/her looted the piles and exposed my bag.  T . T 
---
I collect glowing meat to cook and sell. It pays well enough.
---
That would be my local scorchbeast. Quite the hooligan, but has never gone this far!
---
The only fallout YouTuber I watch anymore is Kottabos and that's rarely. Used to watch Mr. Matty but fuck that guy. If I want to keep up to date with news it's here on this sub.
---
Thanks for the reply, really gives me some insight. I'm also pretty sick of the nonsense. Shame it hasn't died down and doesn't look like it is soon.
---
Please Bethesda do NOT add loot crates. :D But i see what you meant now.
---
I personally disagree. I dont like MMOs. While certain aspect are grindy its no more than other Fallout games. Selling as many items for caps, scavenging for parts for that next mod or repair, gaining xp for the next perk. 
---
The game is so gorgeous and full of incredible lore i cqme back a week ago after a 2-3 momth break and im addicted now. 
---
I say get it and go in blind, dpnt rush the game. Make friends if you want. Its fun with and without them. I play with my little brother and we have a blast finding new encounters, gorgeous envuronments, travrlling to blast zones, defending oyr camp, following the story, discussing lpre, etc. It really is a great game. Albeit rushed, I say buy it now and enjoy it while you prepare for the incoming DLC. I have more fun w 76 than 4 if im being honest. 4 gets lonely with npcs saying the same lines repeatedlt. 76 really is a bigger, feature-increased, multiplayer fallout 4. I love it.
---
How much for T45 helm, T45 right leg, and T51 right arm?
---
I don‚Äôt think you can. I‚Äôm pretty sure it defaults to lowercase. 
---
Maybe just to prevent the classic

How much do you want for Handmade Gun plan?
---
This is the...I don't know. Eighth trade post I've seen here in the last day. 
---
Release the new parts of the quest weekly, but make it so people can still do the earlier parts to catch up. I personally would love this type of thing. 
---
ESO is doing a year long event called "Year of the Dragon", which is based upon this exact idea. 4 quarterly updates: a dungeon, a chapter DLC, another dungeon and an end of the chapter DLC. With the dungeons teasing the larger chapter content. 
---
A year long story for 76, broken into several smaller components with differing levels of plot content, would be 1000% welcomed by me
---
Nice! Random loot, or? 
---
Different types of armor have different benefits. Low Tier: Leather does better against energy attacks (pew pew lazers), while metal is better against physical (bullets or melee), Raider is in the middle. Upper Tier: Marine gives reasonable Rad resist, Combat gives top overall resists. There is also a Light, Sturdy, and Heavy version for Leather, Metal, and Combat armors with the resistances increasing with each rank.
---
From there you have the Mod's applied to the armor that increase the resistances further. Some can give it the "Strengthened" or "Polymer" or other name extensions. Every piece can have 2 mod's applied: a Material Mod which gives it better resistances and a Misc Mod that gives it effects like better stealth, Carry Weight, etc.
---
Then come the legendary effects. Inspect the item in your inventory to ready the description of the legendary effects on any item.
---
The value is based off type, version (light, sturdy, or heavy), mods on the armor, and current durability/total durability. Don't use this to judge its value as a piece of equipment.
---
I‚Äôm not sure either of you know how haikus work

350 hours here. Got Explosive dragon, double-barrel shotgun, 10mm smg, laser rifle, assault rifle,.... Now i strugle to get Wood armor with stealth / ap regen effects. RNG is bitch.
---
This brings up a few good points..
---
Why do can we build display cases, but we can‚Äôt display anything?
---
Why can we build basketball nets, pool tables, etc, but we can‚Äôt pick up and throw items (we could in previous fallouts)?
---
Why do red gas tanks just explode from one shot regardless of where you shot it when in Fo4, if you shot off the valve it made for interesting MacGuyver style missiles?
---
It took 16 completions of Forbidden Knowledge for me to get the paint plan. Picked up a couple of bomber jackets, Engineers uniform and field scribe uniform too though which was very unexpected :)
---
Toys and lead paint. I almost feel like a damn Pack member sometimes. 
---
Something very similar happened to me.  Some level 180 guy comes in the workshop area in the middle of a wave of enemies in a defend event, helps finish them off, and once it's over he blasts me out of nowhere with one of those explosive weapons, kills me before I know anything is happening, and shoots up my corpse for good measure.  
---
Not too bothered about dying, and losing junk isn't really a big deal ... you ought to store anything important in your stash, and PvP at workshops is fair game ... but it sucked when I respawned and was told that every piece of my ultracite power armor was broken ... really sucked.   
---
How do you even get calibrated shocks anyway? It's never dropped for me and no vendors ever sell it.
---
2.5k per Power Armor Plan and it we can trade 
---
Sure I‚Äôll take the arms then 
---
Hmmm, I think he's hacking. Better report him to Bethesda :P

I love you
---
Which ones?
---
2.5 each? So 7.5k if I wanted all 3?
---
Prob named something wrong. Big prob with plans. 
---
Wondering if you have to ask him to "Tag" so you get a chance at the bench?
---
Yeah, I've literally never seen a legendary robot in Watoga until today.
---
2-Live Crew, ca. 1990, would like to have a word with you.
---
This so fucking much this! I wander with no purpose. If Bethesda is going to focus on pvp and adding events while neglecting the big elephant in the room I'm uninstalling this game. I wanted a fallout game to play with friends not a survival game in a fallout world with no purpose but to "create your own fun"
---
I bought the resort sign and resort buffet or something but that one might be fine cause idk wat it is 
---
Probabaly because stability is a huge project and Bethesda doesn‚Äôt know how to do this quite yet. This is their first foray into online games. If they knew how to ‚Äúfix‚Äù stability they would have done it. 
---
I dont mean loot crates like you think I mean. In The Division, you can earn credits during timed public events, and then turn them in to buy 'ammo boxes' and those contained rare and/or event specific drops of armor/weapons/cosmetics. You can also earn other types of credits used to buy cosmetics exclusively, but they were random pulls from 'supply crates' as opposed to the atom shop "I want this pose" type of purchase.
---
I liked the 'one armed bandit' style of opening one and seeing what you got.
---
yea they always work for me i am big on the house building
---
There are MULTIPLE dedicated trade subreddits. 
---
Well that sort of a rounding error. If you check the patch notes, they reduced them to .001 lbs or something like that, which is more realistic. I did the calculation a while back and the actual weight is like .00124 or something so they're not far off.
---
Because they were rushed into releasing it before it was ready by corporate.
---
Surely there's a way to make the bots passive towards him with changing whose caps he's pooling from, right?
---
Oh thought you said 3 star!
---
Didn‚Äôt he get arrested or something?
---
At this point i'm not even sure people want perks or SPECIALs at all, people just want everything.
---
They don't want to manage their inventory, they don't want to manage their weight, they don't want to choose between utility or damage, they just want everything all the time.
---
Did you ever consider that maybe you are trying to build sometihing that doesnt work (for you)? 
---
You said you feel compelled to keep the food/water reduction perk because of Speed Demon, so maybe get rid of Speed Demon?
---
I believe the resort sign is the last little metal sign on the build list
---
For the people that want to nuke a certain site, they can look it up online. I am just recommending a way to get players to nuke more places.
---
Not super common(or even existent) in Fallout 4, but the other day I found a ritual mask, basically the skull mask you can find on dead cultists once in a while(the dead cultist thing may be a random event, I'm not sure, I've only seen it once and never went back to where it was), but can't loot from them. I found it in a Jeep outside of Whitesprings Hotel, but the location itself seems to spawn a random helmet as the next time I checked there was a batting helmet instead.
---
It's dan-ger-ous to go alone, it's dan-ger-ous to go in groups, it's just, dan-ger-ous!
---
Yea it is but it still shows up as locked
---
Want to know why this can't happen?
---
Try running up to anyone's camp as it is. It has to load piece by piece slowly. If they let us stack our camps together, servers would crash on the spot.
---
I hope to see you around, this would give me a kick on gaming night. Although I am in Australia, so unless you are up really late... lol

Would be great to have it stickied at the top. I had no idea.
---
Yeah no loot boxes. Work hard to get item you want. Buy 10 boxes spin the wheel 10 times. Get items you didn't even want. I mean if i work few weeks to get some item and then do not get it because the RNGesus doesn't like me sucks. 
---
Ok hit me up have 1 left GT themisterphenix

Do you find the others through main quest or?
---
Yeah
---
Yep same problem here
---
It's not like silenced revolvers don't exist in real life, although they are extremely rare. It would be cool to have more useful sidearms for stealthy builds.
---
Thank we enjoyed it
---
Oh hm then. Yeah prob named wrong and unlocked some random other thing. Stuff is named so poorly. For example Neither Vault Tec bed 1 or 2 have anything to do with Vault Tec. The one that has VT sheets is called Modern Bed. It's so stupid.
---
That's gonna be a hard pass from me. That's more than double the most I've seen them go for
---
B A S E \~ \~ this is a very hot topic right now, and is one of the main suggestions I raised in my official response to the inside the vault call for feedback.

I've been having a lot of problems lately with players targeting my camp for a large bounty.  It's getting pretty annoying to have to re-plant my garden at least once a day and repair my generator so that travelers can use my rad cleanser and water purifier.
---
I‚Äôve been building up an outpost for players to come by and relax and restock. If we could all combine buildings like that we could kinda make a town 
---
If every reward on the wheel was something awesome, would that matter?
---
each of the rail stations is held by a faction, each faction has a separate pool of caps (enclave is exception to that, they dont have a station, but you get their vendor via the story quest)
---
Karen took the kids and you're deeper in debt
---
I was thinking the same thing but I wanted to role play as a liberal 
---
No problem
---
I've had...i dunno. Fifteen or so in total, one 3 star, mostly non stared. 
---
Wait, are there factions that hold multiple rail stations? 
---
Because I could swear I‚Äôve drained one station of caps and fast travelled to another to find it also empty...

The curse of lurking "new" is you see a lot of these, I guess. I don't know that there's any one official forum, but it's gone from "no ones posting trade requests in here" to "many of them a day" lately, and I don't get why. 
---
When TS is the only thing that makes base gun damage useable it is game breaking for gun builds. Basically now to play a gun build you will have to run around at 20% health. I'll agree explosive needed nerfed or changed to a primary effect but TS did not in any way shape or form. Without the stacking bobbles it is not anymore of a problem in PvP than melee. If they are going to nerf TS then nerf melee damage by 75% as well and make everyone suck. I understand nerfs happen but this is not just a regular nerf it's a 75% and 80% nerf that makes these weapons absolutely useless. With such a drastic nerf if they are going to buff other effects maybe they should tell us so every gun build isn't freaking out and scrambling to change their builds before they can't even kill things to level to change those builds. 
---
My entire build is fokused arround reducing weight of everything. I would like to do other builds... but I'm a horder..

The first original outfit I found was the sacrificial garb in a basement somewhere. Neat stuff.

I know this feeling of falling asleep grinding the vendors for good plans.
---
I'm a casual (still only level 32) and I have always been having to fight the high leveled spawns you idiots leave behind you as you rampage around, so don't tell me that you can't handle it. Git gud, scrub.
---
I think it started when some idiot on Reddit, on this sub, made a bogus thread about how he knew some journo's and that through them he had learned that FO76 was going f2p.
---
Later he admitted it was a complete joke thread, a 'social experiment' to see how gullible people here really are. Of course by then we already had YTers and 'journalists' commented on it and writing articles about a literal joke thread.
---
Now that rumor has never really died so anything that can slightly indicate f2p is immediately played up again. 
---
Should give a good indication on how reliable the media and the YT personalities really are, which is on par with unsourced anonymous reddit posts since that is their source.
---
Be the spontaneous RP you wanna see in the world
---
if you moved your camp when having a tamed animal/monster it would of had to run all the way to your new location, they can't teleport.
---
Yeah, the big thing for me is how it all goes down. People are essentially being bullies, big guy picking on the little one (and sometimes accompanied by their little cronies), and I see a lot of people defending that. It's frustrating, to say the least. At least make it a fair fight. No need to be a jerk.
---
Commenters seem to be focused on the junk. I'm not placing huge importance on the junk, just saying that it was the icing on the cake. Not only does the bully beat up the little guy, he shakes him down for pocket change on top of it. This is the reason I never liked PvP. I am very rarely challenged by people near my level and skill. It's usually the overpowered ones wanting an easy kill.
---
And yes, it can be expected on a PvP server. But that also why I'd very much like to see PvE servers.
---
Ultracite fusion cores are crafted from fusion cores at the cost of one flux. Upon crafting you'll see a small white bar similar to the Fix It Good/Weapon Artisan Bar. They're over 100% even if the core used was at 1%. ;)
---
Finally, I don't have to argue with someone about this game going f2p,because it won't. Thanks Bethesda! 
---
TLDR: OP needs to level up.

/r/walloftext

Tried this several times at level... 20 ish? Failed, of course. Finally got it and had an irrational fear of the whole area until I was post Level 50... now it's nothin'! Some tips:
---
* If I remember correctly, you'll need to use the terminal next to it to open the case. This requires a pass card - that card is one the robot corpse in the NEXT ROOM. I almost had this several times but couldn't find the @$%\^ card!
---
* You can run in like a lunatic, attract all the ghouls and hightail it to either the local robots or nearby high-level players and let them handle things.
---
* Sneaking works wonders if you can invest in the maxed card. If you can't - or hell, even if you can - a stealth boy can be a life saver. Unfortunately they only last a short time - if you can collect several, it would be best. Some magazines and armor also increase stealth.
---
* Mines are often ignored... but a pile of them can solve several of your problems here.
---
* You only have to survive until you have the sword. Dump your junk, spam some healing and run in - it's hectic as hell, but you should be able to get things done. Even if only in pieces: one run to grab the card, respawn to open the case and respawn to grab the sword.
---
* If you're frustrated enough and don't care, don't be afraid to ask other players for help. Most, I think, would be happy to assist.
---
Good luck!

Nothing except a bounty on your head.

yea, responders have 3 i think, raiders have at least 2, etc

I believe you have to unlock metal signs first, then you can unlock the resort one. It's a terrible design. On a side note I have bought 6 of the same locker. 
---
I totally agree. I workshop PvP and chase down wanted players for caps above the vendor limit and because dead players drop junk. That‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt done any m base destruction even though I enjoy PvP. It seems purely vindictive.
---
And damn I wish there were multiple arenas (one for each area type!?) with no weapon or armor degradation or caps/junk loss that allowed for real team fights. One can dream!

Curious, did you ever actually watch the video from TheQuartering about it?

Some clickbaitiness, sure. His grabs are a little sensational. But he stated, several times that it just speculation based off of market trends he was noticing.
---
He also responded to the new information that HE RECEIVED FROM BETHESDA: https://youtu.be/p7VBNRlBjmA
---
&gt; For weapons/armor, its never worth stashing anything non-legendary unless you know you're going to use it within the next few levels or so.
---
Meh.  I stash guns I don‚Äôt have plans to make on my own and slowly stockpile the ammo for them until I run out of the ammo for the guns in my inventory, then switch out.

Of course, then I look like an idiot for killing mole rats with a gatling laser, but *you tell me a better way to be rid of 50+ fusion cores.*

I don't do the stealth rifle part, but I have been dying randomly, like when I think I shouldn't. Like I have health, I'm not getting hit, and randomly dead. Maybe they changed something with having high amounts of radiation can cause spontaneous death or something I don't know.

‚Äú44 - plans‚Äù
---
I learned it because I was curious what it was 
---
Kinda disappointed it was for the revolver 
---
I wish I did. I really did. What dude said to me about me being a girl and shit is getting to my head. It's really fucking with me.
---
I‚Äôve seen Graham walking through the Big Bend tunnel once
---
i would vastly prefer a system for bobblehead and magazines to be permanent items in the perk build, to make the working toward greater things be an effort accomplished by gameplay, by finding the items and completing the quests and objectives that contain the desired thing, like how mutation is but less random
---
Same. Every time I log in I have my entire camp as extra crap ready to be broken down 
---
Nukacrypt.com
---
Has all the codes on it 
---
I want a more saturated Dracula costume
---
Great idea, but I think the mannequins are up to something, like the weeping angels from Dr Who.
---
Yup. Sometimes they appear in groups by the pond near Vault 76. They make good eatin', they do!
---
The scaling is by numbers not level.
---
Same. I've never gone below 550, and that's with active inventory managing
---
It‚Äôs pretty spiky with adrenal reaction I‚Äôve gotten it up to 2k a shot at low health.
---
unfortunately they may be a bug, seen a few people post about the ghost 10% stored. 
---
At level 120 I'm happy with my stash size. The only problem I had with my stash originally was not checking the junk amounts, I ended up with 600 lead at one point this capping out the weight.
---
I occupy my time with farming legendary stuff for myself (still looking for that 2-shot handmade, just one star will be fine please and thank you) and friends of mine.  I have a buddy that uses shotguns and another that likes pistols, so I'm spending my time hunting for specific weapons to share with friends.
---
Aside from that, giving people a wave, depositing unwanted legendaries at my camp (very high traffic spot across the street N of Whitesprings station) and in the blue suitcase at Watoga Station leads to conversation and interaction with other players.  Forming a little pick-up team to farm legendaries or help someone with a quest is always nice.  I met a guy from Kentucky today that was having trouble finishing Mayor For a Day as a melee, because a scorchbeast spawned while he was taking out the gutsies.  I told him to worry about the robots and I'll handle the scorchbeast with my rifle.  He was cool enough to alert me to a 3 star green fire gutsy and let me get a hit on it.  Of course it dropped a one star pipe wrench, but it's the thought that counts.  We had fun and I made a new friend.
---
Gotta define soon.
---
Imo the game is too buggy still and the next big thing is the pvp mode.
---
I had terrible luck with patrol duty, getting dupe plans every time. Leveled an alt to 15 and got it from the Harpers Ferry vendor. 
---
Needing to work around the vendor bug at all was annoying, but running over there as a lowbie was actually kind of challenging/fun.
---
its hard because so many people just want to play single player and run away from everyone
---
Yes it most likely will but you could also just change servers and power armor will respawn in my experience 
---
You can stack multiple food bonuses. Having a small amount of different kinds of food is better than just one type that can only provide a single bonus. I keep a small number of many different foods and drinks and graze it all to keep bonuses up.
---
Damn sorry then
---
Ya, almost 400 viewers.
---
While the next worst game of 2018, Atlas has over 15,000 viewers.
---
Clearly FO76 is wildly popular and nothing needs to change.
---
What's your armor rating? I've got 145 DR, 90 ER, and 1 END and I don't have that many problems with taking too much damage.
---
Frankly I'd rather have DR than Unyielding legendaries (Although I personally like Vanguard's armor, myself).
---
Where is your camp? I need to get in on some of that mothman action
---
Jo gerne IGN: ItsNexusDecay
---
You're saying .... the rain, in game, is rendered on a plane.
---
Bravo is still unsolved. I did the same thing last night, did the full Bravo Silo without checking nukacrypt.com so i ljst thd keycard and time for nothing. Had to abandon it. Sry OP. Sems like the population in this game diminished a frikin lot since nobody solved Bravo yet.
---
If they could stop making me either naked or invisible to my team-mates, that would be incredibly helpful.
---
What could possibly make you comment on a 44 days old thread?
---
As far as I've seen, weight of the equipped weapon makes no difference,  having it drawn vs put away does make some difference.  There's also the gun runner (?) Perk in the agility tree that allows you to move up to 20% faster when maxed and equipped with a pistol 
---
do you ever get tired of moving the goalposts? I think we are done here. The game isnt going f2p no matter how much people like you wish the false rumor was true and there is nothing to show the game is losing bethesda money. again no matter how much you wish it was true.
---
deal with it.
---
oh crap it was under my nose all along but hell thank you for pointing it out
---
So much in this game is so unrewarding. Like Watoga Monster Mash. You save up all those candy and get some trash 1 star item. You defeat a Scorchbeast, that generally isn't easy for most people, spending a few minutes at least shooting at it and waiting for it to land, and you get practically nothing for it. Just why. Who thought this was a good idea?
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.
---
The worst ammo price you should pay is 2 rounds for 1 cap.  2,000 rounds = 1,000 caps
---
Ammo most commonly goes for 4 rounds for 1 cap.  4,000 rounds = 1,000 caps.
---
Some people even sell cheap 10 rounds for 1 cap (not usually, and it's mostly things like 10mm and .38)
---
You have started the legend of 
---
Scorch Slayer 
---
The low level player that will kill nothing but scorched all day because he ~~watched~~ his overseer was concerned with them 
---
You can get one at silo beta enterance, there are few other outfits too.
---
It works alright for me. I have all the mutations except scaly skin, talons, and twisted muscles. I recommend at least getting bird bones to help with the fall damage issue. I'm just running 5 pieces of unyielding and [here's my build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2b238ff&amp;d=pd0a71ar2an2ao0c61ic2pe2p00l71a30a00lv0pk0lr1l10pl0au2s01lt2a40pq0ib4pp2li2ce0eh1la2&amp;w=ir2lu1c71cv2ps0i30ia0i50i44ii0ij2i61if2iq2ie2il2ik0i70ag2at1a51p10pa0p80p90ln0lm2e00co0lk2&amp;n=Mutant%20Covert%20Rifleman)
---
Hells yes :)
---
I LOVE this idea.  Hate having weight reduction perks on my character.
---
That quest took me a long, long, long time to finish.  I got on a server early one morning with no one at Whitesprings and finished it right away.
---
I cannot finish the clown suit wendigo quest.  I've tried it like 20 times.  It'll say I completed it, then when I log back in the next day there it is again.
---
the only thing i know so far is, you can join a server with a friend then drop the items you need to a container then go back to the main menu hit social and join the server again through your friend.
---
I still would like a lot of balance patches before that. Laser weapons are still trash. If they nerf TSE they need to rework the scorchbeast queen's scaling. Unnarmed wespons are unviable endgame because you can't use them in power armor.
---
lulz
---
This the game needs more time to work out the kinks. I am more than happy to wait currently dealing with alot of crashes on pc. My brother is having alot of issues with blue screens on ps4 as well.
---
Also i believe from the sounds of it that we have pvp content comming up first. Could be next patch or the one after.
---
It sounds like a game mode of sorts from main menu.
---
Oh man, if we could just mount that head on an actual assaultron and have as a follower 
---
Crafting is bugged and doesn't register shared quantities between stash and inventory. Got to have it all in one or the other. Always drop a piece of junk you are okay with losing to make sure a bag appears then put the item you want in.
---
I held out for a while hoping that Bethesda would add "known recipes".
---
I finally broken down last night and got the mod from Nexus Mods.
---
It's a changed game.  Not only can you see what recipes you know, it also puts those "known" recipes at the BOTTOM of the list....lol
---
I also got the Saved Perk Loadouts.
---
**Bethesda, if you're listening...........please BUY the rights to the mods, pay the modders, put them on temp staff, whatever.  Get this stuff in the game already :)**
---
As far as I'm aware you run at an unarmed/holstered speed with unarmed weapons, one handed weapons, and pistols. You run slower with rifles, and two handed weapons. You might run way slower with heavy weapons or weapons with the heavy mod, but I'm not sure if the last part is true. It might've just been my imagination.
---
As opposed to what other perks? There's not really many good perks and they're quite frankly not needed to kill shit.
---
I went 15str and all the carry weight perks and I killed shit just fine as sneak sniper.
---
After loggin i had over half of them already completed, but have 0/8. And i have 7 of those i can do, so i am screwed probably.
---
Need it more than a new lamp or sleeping bag ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
You can still eat fruit as a carnivore, for some reason, just not vegetables. But honestly, I've found meat to be so plentiful that I always have too much. Especially when it recovers so much hunger per item. 
---
A bootlegger mission would be pretty cool as well.
---
sent you a request already :) thanks
---
Is the power armor section covering the plans for the armor itself? Because it looks to me like it's just listing the spawn zones for the armor pieces.
---
Glad you replied I thought I necroed this thread, not even sure how I got here. Seems like there should be an easy full list of games and where to find them by now. But some quick google fu didn't reveal it.
---
You seem to think going free to play would be a bad thing...
---
Do you think they are going to assemble a team to create new content with no revenue coming in? This was their finished product and they are barely even working on bug fixes.
---
And how do you suggest they're gonna stay throughout servers? They're not gonna make the server you join static.
---
I agree with you.  People can be real jerks, and there are lots of them playing this game to have fun at the expense of others, like many expected would happen (as with most of these online games).  There are lots of good, helpful people too.  Hard to know what you're going to get.  
---
Like real life.  Some people are jerks ... and you can't opt out of dealing with them, so I've been trying to just accept it, and be weary of strangers in the game.   It would be nice if overpowered people didn't run you down, or destroy your camp, but it's also not realistic in a setting that's supposed to let you "choose to play how you want to play" ... including as a jerk.  
---
Hopefully, with time and experimentation, they'll figure a way to balance things out a bit better so that the consequences (like destroying your armor, or your radiation arch) are mitigated.   Jerks will always be jerks, but at least it can be made not worth their while to bother people.   A PvP only server where they can show off how great they are to anyone who cares ... that might help. 
---
I got the "good doggie" perk from a random pack early in the game, and since that moment, I've subsisted almost entirely on cans of dog food. It fills you up so completely and is so common in the game that I always have about 40 in my inventory. Eating about three or so per game day seems sufficient to keep me topped up. 
---
You mean actual worthwhile workshops? NOPE
---
I'd like it if people could put up signs and stuff all over the place.  Graffiti, etc.  Help each other out or lead people into traps.  
---
Hey OP its not a single man fight she scales off others as well. Have a look around you probably had people not geared or leveled for her.
---
Only failed a few times on her due to our group unable to out dps her scaling. The worse was 6 people under level 50 attacking her. Worse was watching the 32 and 26 go hide in the bunker nearby ...
---
Like thanks for that.
---
They need to make her not scale off other players under level 50 and reward people under 50 no loot. Its an end game fight not meant for low levels.
---
jokes on you, i don't plan to live that long!
---
Thanks for the hard work man!  Going to read it all tomorrow morning :)
---
This really needs some serious updoots. I'm tired of reading the free to play bullshit on fo76. This game will never be free to play because, as bad as bethesda has been recently, they wouldnt fuck over loyal fans this bad. Excuse my language. Rumors are killing this game.
---
On my own I‚Äôve gotten a bloodied explosive gauss with reduced vats ( whitesprings) bloodied explosive pipe rifle (SBQ), assasins explosive pump (random 2 star defending my workshop), a explosive radium rifle.  And a couple more but... no two shots explosives here 
---
Do you mean to say that holding a pistol and holding a minigun have the same effect on your speed. Cause, if so, I'm going to have to disagree with you there. It's pretty apparent if you switch from a heavy weapon to a light one and vice versa mid-motion. 
---
I'm more asking if you have say, that minigun, and then use a perk to make it lighter, will *that* make you run faster than the full weight minigun?
---
Also, by "run", I mean default move speed. IDK if any of this effects sprint but I'd imagine it effects it in a similar way.
---
I'd love a few Brotherhood or Enclave clothing outfits.  Something unique.  Camo.  So far everything I've seen is kinda meh :)
---
Maybe. He's the guitarist from Rage Against The Machine
---
Mine was doing something like that too.  When I first logged on it said I had 10/10 bloodleafs but 0/8 for the challenge and when I fast travelled and looked at it again it said 0/10 bloodleaf.  I was hoping that might've reset it and it would work at that point, but it didnt.
---
&gt;~~level up~~
---
grow up. FTFY
---
I'd never even heard of him until literally 10 minutes ago and I'm already right there with you. The thing with him and the Magic cosplayer (linked above at time of writing)... Ick! What an asshole. I can't take seriously anyone who uses the word "betas" and isn't referring to software. Just... *cringe*.
---
Ah okay that makes sense,  and you were right lol thanks for the quick answer 
---
Ah so it's more based on weapon class rather than the actual weight value of the weapon, if I'm getting you right?
---
Nice, people like that deserve to get rekt.
---
Whoa.  That damage is impressive.
---
I use a Berserker Power Fist effectively with a Hazmat suit in a nuke zone.
---
Yeah, checked all that - just not working.  So much for some easy AP's.  :(
---
How about needing to drink a 12-16 oz container of water every 5-10 minutes of gameplay? You wouldn't even need that much water in the desert. I mean do all vault dwellers have permanent kidney infections?
---
As far as I'm aware yes, but I'm only going by past experience from previous fallout games.
---
Congrats.
---
Atom yes.
---
See also: The Zelda fandom. (Remember when Wind Waker was considered to be worse than most genocides?)
---
Bro, my pipe bolt action is the shit.
---
1. Pacifist is off in workshops. How would it even make sense for it to be on when you are in a workshop, which is a PvP activity?
---
2. Dude was right and the ban confirms it. Not only you were simply toxic, you harassed them repeatedly and abused the report feature. Sorry, but telling you to go to the bathroom and change your pads, while funny, isn't really verbal abuse.
---
I‚Äôm tempted to build a house up there just to have a dog. 
---
Bruh, same here but after my kill corpse disappeared
---
Yeah, they need to back off the fixes a little and go for more content.
---
**Please put SOMETHING new in each patch.**  Something you can do, a place to see, a quest to do, an event, something new to fight, some QOL improvement (known plans, perk loadouts).  If it's little stuff like QOL, do 2-3 things.
---
It feels like they took 90% of the staff off the Fallout 76 project after launch.  The 10% left are scrambling to make the customer base happy but don't have any hope of accomplishing that goal.
---
Thank you
---
And this is why i stopped plsying the game
---
WOW YOU ARE RIGHT ! I WILL ADD CREDITS ! 
---
It's a 1/8 piece to decrypt one of the codes for the following 3 nuke silos: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie. Once you decript one of the 3 codes (via a website called nukacrypt.com) those codes will be viable all week for you and all server. Next week they will expire and reset on mondey. All you need to launch a nuke is 1 keycard you get from shooting the drone acompanied by 3 vertibirds and the code you get from that website i just mentioned. The Enclave in Whitespeings bunker has a terminal that shows you the location of drones or generals holding a nuke code piece. You need to finish the enclave quest and have the rank of general to entwr that bunker. After that you can go to one of the Alpha, Bravo and Charlie Silo located on the right part of the map, complete a 30-45 min long quest in that silo and launch a nuke.
---
Was it a three star flare gun though
---
So you mean to tell me that youtubers been spreading rumors just for the views?!
---
Enemy spot you even when you‚Äôre invisible
---
drifter outfit good sir and thanks for nice words :)

and people that are alongside you i hope i will meet more of good lads

I love the game, I really do. My best friend already all but quit. He'll play maybe 1-3 hours a week. I met two new friends and one of them is already discussing quitting the game. It's hard enough to find really "cool" people to hang out with......and them leaving the game makes it harder.
---
+karma
---
Which event is this?
---
See, i like this idea best. Simple paint pallet that can be applied to any and all armor.
---
Im not really a team player, but itd be cool to have the option of eveyone on a team dress in black, but the left arm of each player is a unique color(for example).
---
It would add alot of simple, non game changing diversity.
---
Did they see you on the map? Were you hiding?
---
600 is not enough. Period. 
---
If you're on PC, I'll bodyguard you through the place to let you finish that part of the quest.  It's a great place for farming legendary loot, so 99.9% of the time there's going to be at least 1-2 lvl100+ players there.
---
My in-game name is Shankwell.
---
Anti armor, explosive, +1 str flare gun would be intresting lol.
---
Depends, I can shoot 50lvl behemond in face from 1foot. I was stabing everything. Sometimes they dont spot you, sometimes you need to "recrouch". Dont light up your pipboy, use silencers, dont run in light areas, be ninja.
---
You still have the garb and are you on PC ?
---
Always jump to the event if people are there. I traveled to the power plant to help once and they finished it while I was running up. That's when I got my plan.
---
I have gotten the recipe for it at The General‚Äôs Steakhouse on the Mire/Bog border. I haven‚Äôt checked to see if it was actually added to my crafting list, though
---
Sources on your numbers please? Oh its just speculation?
---
No. No no no no no no no. I'd rather they charge a monthly fee than do any of the *garbage* you propose. f2p is cancer, pure and simple, and would do nothing but bring a bunch of glowing pustules to this game. 
---
They fight the Train Station vendor bot too if they get close to him. A player was running from a bot tonight and the bot got close enough to the train station and started firing on the vendor bot.
---
Heck, it happens to me when I'm inside an ingame building. 
---
I would be very very down with this idea. But first i want them to fix dropped items falling through the floor.
---
Because trading with new players is a no go. So only way we could give them these is droping them like the others.
---
Have them make noises or light up whatever. But first fix the bags and crap going through the floor. This includes grenades and mines as well.
---
couldnt agree more, its weird the extremely angry gut reaction people have in here when someone suggest they leave pacifist mode or team with other people
---
LOL.  I did that once.  I remember despondently looking at my bag filled with a handful of screws, my first piece of ultracite and some adhesive at the bottom of the pit, shed a single tear and bravely moved forward with my life.  I will never forget you, bag-in-the-pit.
---
The problem is she scales faster than the average DPS added by each players.
---
Multiplayer making boss fights more difficult is stupid.
---
Sometime I wonder , playing fo76, If bgs game designers ever played something other than their own games for the last 10 years.
---
WORD. My camp has been getting trashed lately.  Clearly players are getting bored.
---
I need pink paint
---
I‚Äôve been running a 1 endurance stealth vats build for a while, I usually sit around 20-30% health, for the most part it‚Äôs fine (I‚Äôve got about 260 dr and 220 er, 66 rr and 25 or 50 poison resist). Chameleon on 1 piece, lifesaving on another (no double, sadly). 3 unyielding pieces. I have to be very careful around the SB queen and stay as stealthed as  possible against regular SB (but, I can usually down them in 5-10 stealth+/crit shots from either my AP leveraction or my two-shot/vats accuracy/crit gain leveraction). Scariest thing for me is level 52 gutsy‚Äôs. They can 2shot me if they connect :-/
---
!remind me 3 months

500 atoms? Yikes. Does it at least have a preview photo?

I always knew booze and NASCAR had a deep relationship, but I wasn't sure how. Thanks for putting it into perspective.

Silva Homestead has lots of wild corn and wild razorgrain
---
So if you meet a vault dweller who has 3 sets of every power armour:
---
You would not find that game/lore breaking.
---
Interesting.
---
I got a drill from the queen once
---
Yeah but you should not be forced to play a point blank glass cannon with 0 armor endgame.

---
What do you mean? I‚Äôm level 54, and I‚Äôve been pretty much bombarded with level 68(random ass number) enemies for the last few sessions I‚Äôve played. 
---
I make full set of studded heavy leather with pockets and a Fireaxe with spikes both with with 200% durability for newbies if they hang around. Makes them pretty OP. Hehe.
---
I have an extra set if you‚Äôd like it.  Lazarus801 on pc 
---
Yeah the community would agree. It is silly.
---
Also based on alot of the design flaws i don't think they play many online games. Mind you if i created games all day not sure i would play them at home. But games like Rust, Warframe even wow could show ya alot from a good 50 - 100 hours of play.
---
Just gotta hope they learn fast and take all feedback in as they can. Hopefully if they try another online game in the future their staff will have some idea.
---
So... as a followup. I Scrapped a metal helmet today and to my surprise I did learn how to craft them... So it seems like for certain things, it is confirmed to be learning via scrapping.

Metal Helmet

wow more crap, sorry a crap hat and pink castle bed. enough of thos kiddy garbage more cool shit plz.
---
I have freezes too on PC. It doesn't happen in a specific place. Sometimes it's whitesprings, sometimes it's at my camp and other times it's at some random place on the map. My game freezes for ~10-15 seconds and after this it returns to normal. If there is an enemy nearby I'm dead because I can't shoot it while my game is frozen. 
---
I love the idea.  There are so many perks I want to try out but I can't because of what I need to play the way I want to.
---
I'm not forced to do that, it's a choice. Something fun to do. See if you can get the damage in before getting hit. I also don't have zero armor, though that would boost the damage up even more. I kill glowing ones in a few hits. I dodge back and forth, I jump, etc. to evade them.
---
Crap those all go down with one hit since about level 55. But the end level spot seems to be watoga. It's true that other areas do scale. Nothing is really strong anymore though. I don't stack buffs or anything.
---
Yeah Gutsies are the things that kill me the most frequently.
---
I wish there were other hard events.  Even some that you'd need an entire TEAM of 4 to do.
---
I can solo most events no problem.  Yawn.
---
When you are dying, do you have more or less than 50hp? Did you have the well rested bonus for +50 HP andaxbe lost it at the time of your death? 
---
I am sure its on the patch list already. I would be shocked if it was not corrected next patch. They would know that 5-30 second SBQ fights are not right.
---
It's a changed game. Not only can you see what recipes you know, it also puts those "known" recipes at the BOTTOM of the list....lol
---
I also got the Saved Perk Loadouts. PVP loadout, PVE loadout, repair armor loadout, crafting loadout, and I still have 4 more loadouts left unused. BONUS, it puts up which loadout you have active on your HUD! No more wandering around with ammosmith and super duper perks on when you're fighting things....lol
---
**Bethesda, if you're listening...........please BUY the rights to the mods, pay the modders, put them on temp staff, whatever. Get this stuff in the game already :)**
---
you mean like junk extractors??
---
&gt;stop being a fanboy
---
...what?
---
Unfortunately, I lost it somewhere along the way. It's a shame, I loved that thing. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt protect you from toxic air either üòï
---
Seeing alot less server disconnects this patch but clan has alot and i mean alot of CTDs. My brother and his wife on PS4 are getting alot of blue screens.
---
Hopefully the next patch can correct what ever this issue is.
---
Quartering and Juicehead are dumbasses
---
you shouldnt be using the weight related perks when you do things that require damage perks though.
---
this system is clearly designed around swapping out perks depending on need, yet it lacks any system to easily do so. i'm actually pretty surprised some system wasn't put in place to allow easy re-placement of perk cards (like a second build or whatever).
---

Click on this, i am not taking credit someone else posted it yesterday and I saved it.  It will tell you all yoi need to know. Good luck
---
Yeah, thats what I do in some workshops where you cant build foundations
---
its dumb because the only people who have sooo many explosive bobbleheads are dupers. so dupers get to do infinite damage compared to everyone else.......

---
What platform are you playing on? 
---
Their thought process must be like hey lets give them 95% absolute crap tier drops, so the 5% when they get something decent it will be more exciting. Then we will nerf the crap out of it because it was a little too good.
---
Tank killer only applies to rifles not heavy weapons
---
 I feel like it's 'back that's strong.'
---
I ground my way through Watoga and Whitesprings at least four times today... Without any milk. Only two notable items were harvested.
---
Level 45 items are max level.  Not everything goes to 50.  Marine Armor, Handmades, etc all max out at 45.  Since it's the highest level version of that item, just mentally replace anything that "says 45" with "really means 50" in your head.
---
I should fucking hope not
---
I feel like if I see you I might scream out loud in my house. But if I do see a killer clown I‚Äôll crouch crouch lol. 
---
workshops have potential for this, if it saves and restores what you built the last time you owned it. then you and your team can work on it and invest your materials every time you log in
---
well the massive nerf is what concerns me. But let‚Äôs wait and see what happens 
---
I mean anything is possible, I was more blown away by the writers lack of actual reporting, he only managed to get one short statement from one party and jumped straight to it‚Äôs gonna be a f2p game now
---
I played a game that was solely based on multiplayer, using voxel graphics (Trove) that had much worse server issues on PC and XBox for years into its run. Fallout is doing better than people give it credit for
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
New unannounced "feature" in the last patch. Supply drop loot is no longer personal, and if you lockpick someone else's crate then you get a bounty. I doubt many people intentionally steal the drops, they just don't realise that the mechanics changed.
---
They changed the way air drops worked a while ago. They‚Äôre now locked, and it counts as a container for the person who called it. So now if someone else wants something from it, they have to pick it. Most don‚Äôt bother because they don‚Äôt want the bounty. 
---
I'm on ps4 and i hope to someday hopefully encounter you
---
I would nuke Flatwoods without a second thought.  'Nuff said. 
---
That‚Äôs just what I needed, thanks.
---
Yeah, you and everyone else who plays the game lol. I have 14 points in strength and not a single one is used for anything other then weight management. In total I have 20 points dedicated to reducing weight of everything or to increase weight capacity.
---
I'm currently using a stealth build as well. [https://i.ibb.co/4d7GtkG/Screen-Shot99.png](https://i.ibb.co/4d7GtkG/Screen-Shot99.png) if your interested in it. Its a good balance between damage and weight management along with marsupial and scaly skin mutations and leaves room for explosives expert if you want even more damage if you use TSE weapons. I do but I find having Gunsmith is more convenient.. Although you can get away with swapping out some cards if you get specific weight reductions stacked on your armor. I would recommend ammo and chems.
---
That would make sense considering they haven't changed really any of the other physical mechanics of the game (mutations are just changes in variables, to my knowledge).
---
Then I missed that bit in the patch notes... Thanks for the answer! 
---
The mod or the plan?
---
Thanks for trade.
---
I was really looking for ritual headpiece or hood, but lost the mask a while ago and didn't have time to get another one.

Sadly I think people are just getting bored with the state of the game. I‚Äôve noticed it myself tonight twice at whitesprings. First one we dropped a nuke to have some jerkoff one shooting everything. When my friend killed a legendary that HE didn‚Äôt get to get a hit on he became antagonistic. After some back and forth with pvp and him leaving for a while, we reloged to respawn ghouls again. Things calmed down and I figured we understand each other at this point, he decides to be a dickhead and start mowing everything down again. Lol
---
Shortly after, I relog to a different server that I did not see the nuke on the map, and all the ghouls respawn upon my reentry .... not seeing anyone around I start laying them to waste , only to have another jerkoff get mad and keep hitting me.... Keep in mind once I realized people where here I switched to a weapon that tags not downs.... he proceeds to try to bait me until he kills another player and gets wanted .....
---
This new pvp and pve mode (in addition to new content) can‚Äôt come quick enough imo.
---
Also, do you have a link to the original post?
---
Pvp is automatcially triggered when you do a workshop. It literally says it on the popup. You got destroyed and you wouldnt be any less salty even if was a tire iton that killed you. 
---
When fighting the queen please pull her AWAY from those pits.
---
Had some idiots last night running circles around the pits.
---
When she lands, melee gets to play "dodge the 100% guaranteed death and no loot back" holes.
---
See a green hole, move away from it please.  Otherwise I'll sit there and watch you fight her after I get my 1 hit in.  I'll literally do emotes, take pictures, pose, invite you to trade constantly.
---
None after nerf, you just wasted your money. Next patch they will suck. 
---
Sorry, but I downvoted. I'm in a very similar place as you and while I do bump up against the 600lb STASH limit I am much happier now than with the 400lbs.
---
The bugs that were introduced almost made it not worth it though. I could replicate crashes just by fiddling with large stacks of anything (on Xbox One X) within my STASH. Since then some issues seem to be patched, but it became a fingers-crossed scenario almost every time I opened the STASH. So if it was kind of unstable at 600 it would likely only get worse. That, and the priority was on patching out duping, server stability, and bug fixes. Low hanging and immediate issues.
---
Also, from how you explain it, I think you may be in the minority for how you're going about doing it. Let me explain.
---
Bethesda games, especially Fallout usually require multiple playthroughs to see all content. Since the story is the same in Fo76, it seems that the way to encourage multiple playthroughs is to create multiple characters so that you can try out different playstyles.
---
If you want to "test" different builds, the function of the game mechanics will make it very frustrating to do that with one character, especially when you can only move one SPECIAL pt per level after 50.
---
So as annoying and consuming as it is, you may be better off planning builds with specific perks, armor, and weapons ahead of time and then starting a fresh character to use each build.
---
As much time as it seems to take you to use alts as storage mules and the time consumption of inventory management, it doesn't take all that long to get a character up to 50 (and beyond). Even by 50 you should have a good grasp of how that build stacks up.
---
*there
---
Hmm that's possible. I'll have to keep an eye on that. Thanks for pointing that out. I'll look into it some more to see if I can figure it out but maybe that's what it was.
---
I currently have like 1500 dmg on the gauss. If I remove 80% I‚Äôm at 300. This means it will take me like 30-40 Shots to kill an average scorched beast. Which is super expensive and just not worth the effort
---
I never thought I'd see the day where I had to ask to get a shot on the queen before someone two shot her with a dragon and who knows how many bobbles üò≠
---
If I'm far from home and take a nap or play some music at a stranger's camp while I go afk, I always leave a sack of excess scrap, ammo I don't use, legendary items that don't benefit me, plans, recipes and a dozen or so rad chems and stimpaks near the doorway.  If I come back and it's still there, I pick it back up to deposit in a blue suitcase or cash register the next time I get to a train station.
---
It's always cool to come back from AFK and find the owner there.  I always say thanks for the amenities.  The other day I took a nap at a small wooden camp and dropped warehouse wall plans.  The owner was there when I came back, destroying his wood walls and replacing them with corrugated metal.  I got on my mic and told him that he can press R and then T (on PC) to replace the wall with a different known plan instead of scrapping it entirely.  He thanked me for the plans (I probably dropped a half dozen or more) and returned the three he already knew, plus gave me a bunch of 5.56 and .45 ammo that I can always use.
---
If you're kind to people, 99% of the time they're kind in return.  I often direct players to the blue suitcases that I stash un-needed legendary items, scrap and ammo in, and very often they try to offer something in return.  I did once have a lvl200+ guy (who clearly didn't need anything I was giving away aside from shotgun ammo) gift me with two handmade and combat rifle prime receiver plans, since he saw I was using rifles.  I thought that was very generous.  He also offered an ultracite helmet plan, but I don't use my power armor too often and like the look of my x-01, so I gave it back so that he could pass it along to someone who would really appreciate completing a set.
---
Yeah the guy created the database is a boss, helped alot. As for locations.
---
The elegant clock you get from whitespring
---
The stone benches you get from Graham
---
And security doors I'm not sure
---
Yup. I just keep closing application until it stops. 
---
Any tips on finding Graham?
---
The only fallout where I won‚Äôt pickup fusion cores because - weight, drop Fusion cores, mini nukes and all other formerly valuable stuff just to make it home. 
---
My gf asked what this game was about and why I‚Äôm always at a workbench. I said I‚Äôm basically the can man, recycling junk. Can man- the game. 
---
in inventory? yes, that would be stupid.
---
at camp? nope, that's in line with the game world. We emerged from our vault into the vestiges of a wartime economy where everyone else is dead. of COURSE we're all going to become collectors of cool military hardware and prewar tech, especially given that there are dangerous monsters everywhere so we actually use this stuff every day and love it the same way you love your clothes, car, phone, whatever.
---
OP CHANGE THE TITLE SERIOUSLY.
---
Something like [CLAIM] needs to be added there otherwise your statement is being presented incorrectly as fact and your source doesn't contain jack shit.
---
I always wanted to find a tse railway rifle as I saw how effective it can be. The harpoon doesn‚Äôt seem to do a lot of dmg?
---
Just because we're on the Bethesda fantasy train, a lockable box with a code you can DM them so nobody else can rob it would be amazballs. 
---
Gotta love it.  I just did the daily cop a squatter event, right as soon as I completed I got disconnected from server. I'm starting to think this game is literally  a joke from Bethesda. Like its still "just works"
---
I saw a map of Ghram's paths once online.  It was a JPEG.  He literally goes all over the place, and the path stops, and he teleports to another part of the map.
---
Your best bet is to get up on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  Traders love to farm Ghram for Powered Gates, so they tell everyone when they have him..............so a whole group of them server hop farm him.
---
Seriously, that's the best way to find Ghram.  Just hit reload on your browser on those main pages............and make sure it's set to NEW.  Eventually you'll find someone who's locked Ghram down and you can farm him for 10-30 minutes.
---
Had a great experience earlier, a 120 invited me to his team gave me a supressed lever action with .45 ammo, then we spent the next 5 hours doing events, blast zones, fought the scorchbeat queen. with him i went from 27 to 31. He also gave me ammo like every 15 mins and dropped alot of recipes for me and we went around the map opening treasure map mounds. By far the best experience i had in gaming if not ever than a loooong time
---
There are some holotapes, notes and writings on the wall that suggest that the world is simulation.
---
Do explain?
---
I'm constantly on the edge of 595/600 and 200/225. While the latter is more or less understandable, I think the limitation on STASH is heavily crippling, and having like an additional 200-400 lbs could save me.
---
Awesome interactions like that is what I look for. I just went hunting down this level 15 to drop him this sweet lvl20 two star piece of armour. Finally got to him, but he immediately DC'd. Probably thought I wanted to harm him :// Thought that counts, right? Hahaha
---
If you hear ticking, fast travel immediately.  It's the fastest way out of the zone.
---
If you travel around over-encumbered all the time, well sucks to be you....lol
---
I think he always follows the same route, I don't know if someone has put up a map of the route but if they did you could run it.
---
Or just be vigilant on checking the market if people post they found him. Make sure you get someone else to join you so you can keep logging off and back in to change the items in store
---
Lmao
---
It just fucked with since dude tried to call me a female for fighting back against them and harassing them. But they come to the workshop and kill me and fucking take it over. I'll never use a workshop in solo. I'll only use em in empty or light servers or with friends.
---
Every update, I hope they put it in. :/
---
Yes you can immediately apply it without any needed materials.
---
President Eckhart for example thought that the world was a simulation like the one we saw in Operation Anchorage, and the only way to break out of it is to nuke China.
---
You can find out about that if you listen to logs in Enclave Bunker.
---
It‚Äôs probably because somehow Bethesda can‚Äôt get rid of the dupers. 
---
the content really isn't the same. one is basically a hyperlink to downloading the game, which on top of all is physical and may be lost, stolen, or otherwise damaged, while the other is an electronic receipt that also works as a key, download link, etc.
---
question, if you use your CD, do you still have to know your account details and login through their launcher?
---
Speak for yourself. I find no fun in hoarding un-necessary clutter and would only use the most ideal armours and weapons that suit my character - AT THE TIME LEVEL AND PLACE ITS USEFUL.
---
You guys are asking for luxury in a survival game.
---
I frankly think thats all coming from overly invested consumers of personalisation. Same kinds of people that bring technology camping, have warehouses full of junk or make a business that looks great but makes no money.
---
Not everyone consumes like you do, and you would be ignorant to not think differently after reading this.
---
&gt;Pacifist is off in workshop PvP. How would it even make sense for it to be on when you are in a workshop, which is a PvP activity? What do you expect, to roll up on someone's workshop with pacifist on and just take it over because you're immune to damage or other way around? Doesn't work that way.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Dude was right and the ban confirms it. Not only you were simply toxic, you harassed them repeatedly and abused the report feature. Sorry, but telling you to go to the bathroom and change your pads, while funny, isn't really verbal abuse.
---
Are you gonna tell me to grow up? Or are you gonna respond. I bet you're one of the guys. Either way go ahead and down vote me because you're gotta start a war.
---
It's not. Mods apply across heavy/medium/light types.
---
I think the problem here is the misnamed marine/combat armor plan.
---
76 in a nutshell lol.  Btw how do you have that raiders thing next to your name? I'd like a free state one lol
---
 this would be a great addition 
---
What do you mean you don't have zero armor? The Hazmat suit replaces all your equipped armor so you basically play naked.
---
WARNING, trusting randoms in this reddit is high risk.  They gank your stuff, nothing will happen to them here.
---
If you want a more reliable method of finding someone who won't gank your stuff, ask for mule help in the FO76 Market reddit.  You can see their trading karma right next to their name.  If they have 50+ karma they've done a lot of trading with other players and are pretty reliable.  Plus you can get banned off the reddit if you scam people (and you'd go back to 0 karma on a new account).
---
TLDR  When looking for a mule, go to FO76 Market reddit.
---
I'm with you in this, I'm a huge Fallout fan and have probably put in thousands of hours playing the previous games. I never thought I'd enjoy 76 as much as I do, I just love the world and exploring it. I do miss NPC's thought.
---
call me a female for fighting back against them and harassing them
---
Don't harass people and you won't be called anything.
---
Hopefully, laid after belting that out using a *soothing* voice
---
Yes as long as you have the proper materials to make it. Be careful storing mods in your stash, I've had mods disappear before I had the materials to craft them so I would say keep them on your person if you care about them. 
---
Mods I've lost from stash: 
---
Jetpack
---
Barbed pitchfork flamer
---
Heated coil power fist
---
T51 calibrated shocks
---
Those are the ones I noticed and paid caps for
---
I love how you go for personal attacks to defend this game. Says a lot about the state of the game.
---
That‚Äôs weird. Yesterday I had to pick lock my own supply drop. It was only level 0 but still. Don‚Äôt know if I got a bounty
---
Mines better. I killed a legendary earlier and it dropped the most bestest gun ever. It doesnt even shoot bullets. Instead it has a pointy metal spike attached to it that goes WRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
It doesnt even use ammo. I think it might be infinite ammo. I dunno.
---
&gt;	*mirelurking intensifies*
---
My grand grand grandma once told me: "Don't believe everything, what's on internet."
---
yep pretty much but sounds like you hit the rng lotto. usually you might get one or two, or sometimes none.
---
The 44 Revolver plan is just called "44". The Western Revolver plan is called "Revolver".
---
jup. And it‚Äôs gonna get much worse with the upcoming nerf for TSEs. Which imho were the guns really doing a difference with that type of bad design
---
Respond to what, you loon? You didn't ask anything. 
---
Can you give me a link to a bethesda person telling us it's going free ton play? I've yet to see anything official.
---
I had a blast with Grahm recently when he walked near a Whitesprings nuke zone. We tore apart so many ghouls together.
---
I believe Abraham Lincoln popularized that quote.
---
Mods like calibrated shocks and jetpacks are also great for using as steel even if you already have some in your stash as well :P
---
I love how in a comment above you accuse me of being broke despite yourself being the broke one. Get a life bud, and stop wasting your money on companies that treat you bad. This kind of behavior might explain your own money issues.
---
There's a little thing on the side to edit your flair.
---
Yeah, best you get is prime receivers (like 1 in 20 chance) and the occasional rare non-legendary weapon.
---
That's because it's **not** going f2p.
---
2 pictures that really amazed me were 49 and 53
---
Again beautiful story telling 
---
How?
---
??
---
Bethesda called bullshit on the free to play shit. It's on the frontpage right now.
---
There are perks and mutations that give your resists. Though that will of course interfere with the Berserker legendary effect.
---
I just got it tonight and placed it just fine.
---
And this is why you're an asshole. There's PvP and then there's griefing. This is the latter.
---
I‚Äôm there too. Someone once killed him and I left Fred a plant to remember him by and he had his 3 flamingo friends attend his wake.
---
That sounds awesome! I just had a similar experience too! Shout out to u/BrilliantMulberry for giving me a seriously special experience with multiplayer! 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, I‚Äôll add you! :)
---
I don't know about the *rest* of the WV locations, but the Whitespring and the Greenbrier are [spectacularly alike](https://youtu.be/rLLD_pWQ2EE). 
---
Why do I need to fucking grow up. I just lost my shit enough said. 
---
That's bizarre. Dang I may have to put in a support request maybe?
---
Seriously???? Can you send me a link to whatever would help me get started with that? Lmao
---
I have scrapped or dropped every single one. Have fired &lt;5 missiles ever in 76. The weight to worth ratio isn't worth my time.
---
Jup. The botched loot system is what let most ppl to buy weapons from other players for horrific prices. Ah and I have great news for your explosive: With the upcoming patch 80% of it‚Äôs dmg will be nerfed. 
---
What kind of trader is that without a pack brahmin stumbled in his pathfinding thoughts?
---
Sweet thanks
---
nope. I use my Axe
---
I played tons of Trove, I can't agree. Also you could at least load back into the same server on Trove. WoW was terribly unstable at launch, but you could still log back in and loot the boss you killed. The only multi game I would relate to 76 was Ark...... In it's alpha. Empyrion alpha was ridiculously more stable than this. 
---
I think the problem is they took a single player engine and tried shoving multi in it instead of building fallout around a proper multiplayer infrastructure.
---
What are we looking at here?
---
More surprised that any thought it would go F2P. Unless Bethesda comes out and says something then i would just disregard it. Explains their tweet earlier today about this rumor.
---
nothing has changed, except one thing. majority of people have just come online. the same lack of comprehension visible in masses now has always been there, but not online.
---
so the only difference between now and then is that more of the general population is online, which means there is more space for this kind of thing, with more potential followers.
---
these kind of things might sicken you, but compare it to reality (scientology, charles manson cult, etc) and it does look really tame. even when comparing online to online - these youtubers with say, bots operated by ISIS sending automated messages to people who talk about death and suicide - this seems pretty tame.
---
i guess what i'm trying to say is, all things considered, it's not that bad. people want things. better this than something else. everyone needs to be connected to something, whether it's hate for a game/love for a youtuber or vice versa.
---
1: PlayStation 4
---
2: Evilknievel-
---
3: Blue screen error - CE-34878-0
---
4: So every damn time I play Fallout 76 my game crashes after a few minutes. Its a blue screen and I deleted all data, initialized my PlayStation 4 HD and updated it all recent updates. Nope only game giving me issues, since last update. Before it was just doing the usual freezing and being broken, now it's beyond broken and my friend online also has the same issue. So how can we fix this or can you update this game to fix it. 
---
I deleted my  C:\\Windows\\System32 folder and now everything is working so much better, I even looked out of my window, I may go outside later.
---
Sorry, I'm not clarvoiant to know your question before you ask it. Learning to control your emotions is part of growing up and you got ways to go it seems. Enough said.
---
this must be satire, right?
---
yeah my second melee char with lvl 51 can already one shot Level 100 players. After the nerf it will even more ridiculous. 
---
The first time I ran into Grahm was just off the shores of DeathClaw island, I checked out his wares and my 7yo son saw the crossbow he pleaded with me to buy it and like the good daddy I am I purchased this crossbow, but not before he cleaned his room. Only met him once more since then, I hope to see him again soon. 
---
Not saying you're a liar or whatever, but the challenge only start hours ago...not days ago
---
Could you give details? I‚Äôm too young to have played it.
---
Every comment in here needs to be seen. We like challenges, but we like those which are fun. Spending 1/3 of my in-game time juggling stash &amp; on-board carry weights IS NOT FUN, NOR A GOOD USE OF GAME TIME. I'm an adult all day long. I HATE logging in only to have to "adult" the shit out of my inventories as well for ridiculous amounts of time.
---
Ah the same Neckbeard molerat who has been on a role with the Fallout hit pieces and "lets get to 10000 likes so I can give you TWO SHITPIECES" comments. The dude has zero credibility, I hope he he gets copyright stuck, the dude basically told people don't buy the game it will be free very soon. You're fucking with the people eho worked on the games money at that point.
---
Lol seriously.
---
I would really like that option.  It's a lot better than leaving a gift bag that will disappear when I server swap or get kicked.
---
Lol I am so glad I don't have to play my favourite game with these morons with peanut brain. I don't see any problems with them staying as far away from fo76 as they can. 
---
The harpoon gun has a "flechette" mod that essentially makes it a shotgun. It does great damage and you get free ammo
---
How's $50 sound?
---
The quartering is a incel, what did you expect
---
I have an extra plan.  Are you on PC?  I'll be happy to give it to you.  gt: Shankwell
---
Or don't.
---
Just don't call yourself a part of the community if you're here to fear monger. People can smell bullshit.
---
Same since last update and I'm on PS4 too
---
Fear not friend. I'm aussie, PS4, and I  have everything OP has, and some time to spare. 
---
Maybe the copycat clown will appear in the woods near YOU!?
---
Same on Pc here, I went to Lewisburg, collect ashes roses on roof, nothing...OK ! Those one are not registered, i have to found "wild one"... Collect "blue flower" (can't rememeber the name) on the same roof, working 3/10 (confirming it has to be"wild")
---
Nothing for carrot flower (next to lewisburg station).... OK lewisburg is buggy ?   
---
Logoff, (for eating time) switch to whitespring : 0 blue flower on 10 !!! while i had 3 !! .... OK, this quest is buggy...
---
and now i check on internet...i'm not alone ! thx :)  
---
We need more NPCs like Graham and Chally the Moo Moo.. hoping a good group of vendors come out of the vault with the dlc.. 
---
I don't know for 100% certainty, since I'm not there to see it, but I think paper bags disappear when you log out, disconnect or otherwise leave the server.
---
I felt that way about it until I saw the super-minimal one without the road and power lines. The simple Mount Blair silhouette sold me on it.
---
It was shit tectonics. Two shit plates rubbing up against each other, creating a shit quake, Ricky.
---
Aw, shucks üòÑ
---
I love having a team. Alone, I stay in camp or workshop. So glad you found us!
---
Even if it was they probs could just IP ban
---
ItalianProdigy?
---
They need to expand the no camp area around Whitesprings main areas. Should not be able to farm ghouls via the camp bit.
---
Hey if you see this Zack my internet is down til Friday, I'll catch up with you guys then
---
In what way is this fear mongering? I literally just said that F2p rumours aren't real. That's not anything bad.
---
Stop /r/gatekeeping
---
There are plans for a Cooking Stove and a Kitchen Stove.
---
Only the Cooking Stove is the crafting station, the other is just decoration.
---
If I can make a suggestion, build a bed with a frame.  You can catch diseases from sleeping on floor-based bags and mattresses.  Coming back from an AFK and having swamp itch is never welcomed.  The effect itself isn't terrible (not great for a stealth build that likes high AG) but the constant alert that I have a disease is highly annoying to me.
---
As someone who eats a single meal every day with the occasional snack I feel like my character must be bloated as fuck all the time. 
---
no, some servers have maintenance independently as needed
---
Oh. I totally didn't realize that 
---
I'm an idiot.
---
I wish. I'm a machinist IRL and I like seeing stuff like that in video games. I was excited when I saw the the C.A.M.P. module has a mini lathe and a drill press on it. It's also funny at times, because I struggle to comprehend how someone could make a full firearm, barrel and all, with just the drill press/mini mill on the weapons workbench and only an X axis. Lol
---
So *that's* why he was acting so recklessly! It's not like the Enclave to kill its own and be so careless of long term consequences. This explains a lot.
---
I assume they're all locked by default. Where would you even get a key? 
---
Too much power for one person to handle. 
---
key card will remain valid for your next visit to that silo. 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs kinda dumb. They should just open like a locked door you own.

1.)First load in cannot move, but I can fast travel. Takes exiting out of the game launching game load in and loading out to fix the issue. 
---
2.) first hour playing with get the blue screen 3rd or 4th building after relaunching game will go smooth.

3.) random chest piece will disappear when I‚Äôm wearing it, and will be gone from both my inventory and stash, currently been through 3 legendary chest pieces. My current one has stuck for a while now. 
---
4.) I‚Äôm guessing you know about this one but when crafting (and having the perks attached) crafting materials both in my inventory and stash box says I do not have materials, when in fact I do.  
---
Before I commenting again I will try and grab screen caps.
---
You must've lucked out with trove then, in 450 levels of mastery I rarely had any days where the servers were "good": I even logged on again for shits n giggles a few months ago and was almost immediately booted out of the hub world within seconds of connecting. Logging back in to the same server on FO is the same as trove - play with a friend to increase chances or just dont get super attached to your server. They both have their player-based permanence aspect (cornerstone/camp) so you can always port over your personal stuff.  They definitely could have done more than just reshell FO4 and update some features, but they're actively engaged and working on issues at the very least. 
---
People complain about lack of communication but look at other titles like Destiny- the community tore them apart for going months without comms and doing stuff that hurt gameplay with no explanation.  Bethesda at least seems like they're trying, even if they arent the best at fixing everything lol.
---
Goota pay those bills
---
Bro watching youtubers rant about other youtubers....
---
Why not just make a thread here in an open form discussion regarding your issues with it. I know you lads don't get paid for it but it makes for a better back and forth with the community.
---
Got a screenshot? I wasn't even aware Flare Guns appeared in legendary pools.
---
The worst thing too is the stash doesn't seem to benefit from your weight reducing SPECIALS. so stuff like junk ends up using a ton of extra space and it can be hard to tell what will actually fit in the stash since the weight you are told is different than what it will weigh in the stash.
---
 /u/TheQuartering is a paid shill trashing the game like it's a career
---
Who hurt you, TheQuartering?
---
Yeah I wanted to upload it with this post but it's doesn't let you put images up
---
There's a way to get it for $0 by literally just playing the game. 
---
Thank you for all the answers. Great community you have here. :) I added all of you and accepted all your friend requests.
---
This is essentially me. I barely grab junk. When I do it's only to repair my equipment. 
---
That's my next priority item, myself. That modern fireplace item keeps getting pushed back and pushed back. Every time it moves from the #2 item on my shopping list to my #1 item, something else appears and takes that #1 place. Right now, that chandelier is it.

Here,  I uploaded it

I wouldn't say it's dumb. It makes sense because you don't get keys for supply drops. We can assume that there's no master key for all the crates, otherwise you can just go around and unlock all supply drops you find (including those of other players) without issues. 
---
People always love assuming things
---
This got a little too personal and I have mixed feelings about continuing to respond, but...
---
This is a survival game, sure. The survival part of it is pretty friggin' easy most of the time...by design. We are (in f76) in a world with *more stuff than people*, more supply than demand. again, everyone else is dead. A few hundred people came out of the vault and that's it until we start reproducing (which we cannot do but wouldn't that be a neat idea later). We have a whole state worth of prewar resources to pillage. Even if you're some kind of cranky aescetic (and believe me, i get the appeal and have lived outdoors with no technology for long periods of time, part of why i can't take survival/crafting games too seriously because they always miss the mark somewhere), you can't deny that other people like collecting and having stuff, even in a desperate situation. Moreover, the situation of the f76 dwellers *is not desperate*. We are the most advantaged group in the postwar US because we were in a control vault, a near utopia by wasteland standards. The culture of prewar comfort and consumerism would be alive and well in such a group.
---
Regardless of all that, this game is light on roleplay and consequence, heavy on collecting crap. You seem to be coming at it from a serious roleplayer's perspective, something I would not be able to do with this game. I have a deck of "perk cards" which represent...skills i learned? They're pretty abstract and game-ey. I have food which represents...sustinence? A little, but more important are the stat buffs and HP regen. Once again, pretty abstract and gamey. Do you find it immersive to go to pip boy and click on nuka-cola or corn soup four times to regain all your health after a fierce gun battle? I don't think seeing a camp full of cool power armor would be an immersion break for me (although the fact that such things can't be wrecked or stolen sort of is).
---
I stopped playing this game over a month ago due to this. I was tired of finding so much good shit, only to have to basically dump valuable items to make room for slightly better different stuff.
---
I never had enough room for scrap, and like mentioned in several comments above; I'd end up needing stuff I got rid of a few hours ago. It was so frustrating, that the constant grind, which I was okay with, became practically pointless. I was netting such a small return from my runs that I began to just hate playing the game.
---
I don't know how people are even setting up "shops". I don't even have enough of anything for myself, let alone to sell and trade. 
---
Side Note: these games have always allowed my indulge in hoarding a bit; stockpiling like I would totally do in a real apocalypse. This game has just become a waste my time simulator.
---
Hmm let me count the ways to solve being over encumbered 
---
Power armor users first
---
1 get excavators with shocks Or any power armor with calibrated shocks
---
2. Weight reduced weapons
---
3. + str mod for chest
---
4. Check to see what mats you need to repair armor,guns and craft ammo ......and only keep a lot of these mats
---
5. L2p and quit whining
---
Non power armor users
---
1. Armor modifiers that reduce weight - 20% weapon weight
---
2. Food
---
3. Weapon weight mod on weapons
---
4.  + 1 to str on armor
---
5. Marsupial mutation
---
6. Check to see what mats you need for repairing armor, guns, and craft ammo...and only keep these mats in bulk
---
7. Learn to play and quit whining
---
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll roll out the pay-to-win lunch boxes the dataminers found right after the nerf. 
---
I had this happen earlier. Once you spawn, don‚Äôt open your pip boy and wait about five minutes or so for everything else to load. That worked for me and a few others. 
---
Stopped following the fallout hate train, too busy trying to find my shadowed mods! üòÉ
---
&gt; The column would be ok if we could place stuff on it, but I heard that's not possible. 
---
Evidently it's tricky, but not impossible. [Bethesda addressed the topic here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aip5g4/dont_buy_the_classic_column/eeq6vnk/) 
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
So it's only used when you punch in the code?
---
There's no need for a support ticket, the PLAN  you are looking for is called Cooking Stove.
---
Some people just don‚Äôt like watching others have fun. He‚Äôs one of them. 
---
*Denzel*
---
My man!
---
I don't think it will ever get to the source like that. 
---
Haha I'm on locker plan purchase #5 myself, still waiting for it to be the white one.  
---
Is that the bureaucratic mission? I hate that also.
---
I have a high traffic open house just north of Whitesprings station, and 90% of the time I come home with all my doors wide open and the decon shower running.  The wasteland is clearly populated by young men that aren't used to putting the seat down after they piss as a courtesy for the women in their life.  Usually enemies come in from the west and get caught up messing with my outdoor mutfruit, razorgrain and scarecrow (why does my missile turret/spotlight only work when it wants to?) rather than venturing inside.  Recently I got a brainwave and built a couple concrete barriers on the far western perimeter of my camp space.  The majority of enemies will just stand there and try to destroy the barriers, which are far more durable than the nearby crops.  I'd much rather repair a barrier with concrete scrap than scrap and replant my garden several times a day.
---
Tittties
---
That is a great idea.
---
Use Grape Mentats too. I tried a Charisma item once but it didn't seem to make any noticeable difference. I guess you need a bunch of points to notice, or maybe I just didn't pay enough attention. That's good to know though, thanks.
---
I brought this up recently on here too, I went back through the patch notes and it wasn't mentioned at all, it's another undocumented change.
---
The same happened with Mass Effect: Andromeda. There were a number of issues which got fixed a week after launch, but for a year afterwards, people kept posting the same screenshots of these issues and discussing them as though they were still a part of the gameplay experience of anyone playing them at that point. There's a lot of stupidity and dishonesty in these types of discussions. 
---
Tag him into it as well i believe he is on reddit alot. Better chance of him seeing it than a fellow youtuber. It would be good for youtubers to stop jumping the gun and you have good points to get across.
---
I‚Äôve got this exact same issue. I‚Äôm on PS4 and I was previously able to build the kitchen stove and then after I moved my CAMP I wasn‚Äôt able to anymore. I went and bought the plans for it and the stove remains locked. 
---
I found a workaround though.... I just built a campfire in the middle of my living room (joking, I put it on the patio, I‚Äôm not a madman)
---
I got the full set while trying to find the Witch costume plans. It's at a much more common event at the North 95 marker than the Trick-or-Treaters.
---
Nope 10 luck. I get shit.
---
Definitely agree with 'dungeon runs'.  Sometimes the more open concept defender missions, as well as workshop defence for that matter, give you shitty pathing enemies and most of the time is spent finding them.
---
Using the existing locations (Mines, Bunkers, Vaults, etc.) gives you a smaller location with more interesting layout and possibility for strategic defence.  Uranium fever has this feel with varying entry points to the main room.  The ammo factory defence somewhat has this feel.
---
Also, I would assume 'underground' events might not affect server stability as much when spawning a shitton of enemies since they're not on the map at large.  You could have better scaling difficulty and number of enemies based on number of players at event.  Wave clearing events like you said should also be possible in underground events.  
---
I wouldn't be opposed to a notification system for this style of event.  Server wide prompt when there's a 5:00 cooldown before the event starts - "Get to Vault 94, you can fell (big boss) rumbling."  Would be a good way to encourage multiplayer events.
---
Now that I'm thinking about it, a colour-coded system for events on the map could be helpful.  Green for pre-event (time left until start), yellow for time remaining of an event underway, red for cooldown until event can be played again.  Then make that an on/off toggle on the map screen.
---
I also have speed demon and I use The canibal perk to eliminate carrying massive amounts of food and I also use a perk that decrease the negative effects of my mutations (i think that perk is in endurance or  luck) try them out :) 
---
thank you!
---
If that happens... you will see biggest shitstorm ever. I think Bethesda made a lot of stupid design choices but they are not that stupid. 
---
Quartering?
---
YEAH!! I ran into a site name [the college monk](https://www.thecollegemonk.com/) which has the loading speed similar to super mega sloth!! lol 
---
I believe private servers are on their list to add to the game.
---
You ever just eat salt
---
I like to be a lurkey overwatch. I'll find a low level person running around on their own and just stalk after them and watch. If they get in over their head, I whip out my sniper rifle and thin the herd so they don't die.
---
I'm like the Mysterious Stranger perk except actually helpful. 
---
I can confirm Metal Helmet. I just got that today.
---
Nope, but from your pip-boy you can assume charisma increase rewards from group quests - events.
---
I literally only eat dog food and I just sell the rest. When try a level I do make glowing meat steaks and cranberry cobblers tho. 
---
The problem is that there aren't enough materials in your inventory or in your stash **alone** to make whatever you're trying to make. For some reason, the game can't wrap its head around taking 5 steel out of your inventory and 10 out of your stash; it needs to see 15 in one or the other.
---
Be sure to invest in some turrets for your CAMP. They're of dubious value at higher levels (aside from missile turrets, which are always awesome), but at low levels, they're an absolute lifesaver. An easy way to get the scrap you need to build them is to [build your camp next to a junk pile and then build a junk extractor on top of it to continuously produce useful mechanical scrap like gears and springs and such](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl6yqMJX9x4). 
---
Selling bulk mats to keep your stash clear does help alot. Also dumping all ammo and going melee instead :-)
---
It's a shame stealthy gameplay or anything without a power armor isn't promoted, everyone is just stomping around.
---
Are you the one who plays creepy carnival music on his mic?  
---
I had a run-in with a clown a few days ago up near the racetrack.  I heard weird music, saw a clown coming at me and ran very quickly.
---
Lol yeah I was blown away when I got on recently and saw that the stash size was the same I booed out real quick because my stash has been full for so long and I‚Äôm not going to waste my time dealing with that shit when I could be playing other games
---
The guy just put out the possibility that this game might go free to play. I dont know how is that a bad thing. 
---
I also dislike when bethesda endorses a witchhunt against players with the "duping" thing.
---
Honestly stupid to not go free 2 play at this point, the game is a catastrophic commercial failure as a pay for game
---
Tbh I prefer the regeneration perk. It'd let me sell some of my stimpaks, tho I reckon I'd just dilute more to stay above 150 total. 
---
I was afraid of that. Lack of content and shit drops really make it difficult to muster up the desire to play. Three star legendary regularly dropping one star zealot rolling pins are the bane of my existence. 
---
why must people here scrutinize every slightly negative comment regarding Fo76? do you realize how desperate that is?
---
the game is bad and every other week Bethesda manages to mess it up even further. just suck it up and play it, don't pretend everything is fine and go full defensive when someone points it out.
---
YouTuber that just says shit to start circlejerks, doesn't actually follow up on his leads, and looks like an idiot when his incorrect reporting comes to light.
---
Thank goodness. As you can see I am a bit peeved -.-‚Äú
---
I think the problem is that Bethesda is good at making single player games but has no clue about MMOs. Which is also shown by using super old technology as the engine for this game. 
---
Thus I think nobody really thinks the choices being done through. I hope they learn however since the game has potential. But it will take time and effort. 
---
You get them from Abbies bunker quests.
---
[Yes it is.](https://youtu.be/6n3pFFPSlW4)
---
It is a bad thing if he wants to be game news outlet.
---
I had a pretty amusing experience with this the other day. My main character is around level 160, and for about an hour I had this level 20 guy following me around like a remora; he'd take a few shots at any enemy that I encountered, which were all like level 68. He did negligent damage, of course, but when I killed them, he'd get full XP and the chance to loot their corpses. I was entertained enough by the audacity of it that I even revived him a couple of times with stimpacks when one of these enemies got close enough to take a bite out of him. 
---
Why do my emotions tell me just from the one word daddy this is a lie ? 
---
It is reward for some quest. Did you done those firefighters line? I got if after doing some quests for PS4 achievements.
---
I never said everything is fine...
---
To me it seems they either need to increase max special or buff and decrease the number of cards. 
---
I‚Äôve already done them so.....
---
Yes it is
---
Level 62, 44, and 23 here; I and a few friends really enjoys playing 76.
---
When i played FO3, NV and FO4 all i wished and hoped was something like a Co-op mode to play with some friends and family members ^(()**^(i won't include 1,2, and tactics because it was good without having any Coop mode/Multiplayer)**^()).. Since 76 is having that my opinion can be considered biased :D hopefully the in-game bugs (yep there's alot :D same as the previous ones) will be fixed and servers will be improved (you will get disconnected from time to time). 
---
Speaking of NPCs, yeah i do miss the NPC interactions but i guess somewhere down the line, they will be adding them as it will make sense.. (Wooby :D)
---
^(\*\* i was hoping to play with family or friends like a substitute for the companion NPCs on the previous FO titles. i know some will say MP/COOP wasn't there because it will break the main story (lone vault survivor etc..))
---
Oo i understand the anger and i reaaaaallly wish people under 50 could not scale her or get loot from her. She is an end game boss not meant for them yet.
---
But we have been hanging for private servers for abit. Hoping they are not too far off.
---
Well, it's in the code, so they're certainly considering it. I hope you're right though.
---
Yay! 
---
Fingers crossed we do get it! 
---
Alas, I can't be bothered as a solo player to invest heavily in charisma. My charisma at three may be the reason I get such shit rewards for events then. So bad I don't even bother with them anymore. 
---
I've been playing both Fallout 76 and Black Ops 4 and I feel so sluggish in Fallout after playing CoD.
---
If pacifism was god mode, that dude on the oatmeal box would still be alive. 
---
Lawbreakers and Battleborn said the same thing.
---
Huuuh. The surveyor outfit there I haven't seen many other places either. 
---
Me too.  I use the occasional player interaction as a chance to unload.  
---
I just feel bad for this guy... its his first Fallout game.  
---
&gt;hell the game itself is great value for 60$
---
You‚Äôre actually mentally ill
---
yes but people like you in this sub will put anything negative people say about the game under a microscope and check for semantics, just about anything to try and discredit their statement and make the game look less bad.
---
I've seen people scrutinizing and trying to justify the canvas bag, the nuka rum, the y2k bug. positivity is one thing, but that's just sad.
---
It incease only how much caps you get i think. Just theory.  You will get legendary armor pieces anyway.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say the engine‚Äôs problem is being super old. It‚Äôs main weakness is the huge amount of dynamic clutter and physics which I can‚Äôt remember another online game tried to make workable.
---
This is coupled with awfully inadequate server performance / tick for this.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can unlock other headwear by scrapping a few, but I never tried with the cosmetic ones.
---
Like it; if the plots are locked to a player (perhaps with a ‚Äúmust be on x hours a week‚Äù rule of some kind) the settlements would fill up pretty damn quick. 
---
But love the idea of small 2x2 huts all on top of each other populated with real people per Diamond City. 
---
Have you not seen any of the other games that went FTP?
---
There have been many games exactly like fo76 that went ftp.
---
The sales
---
I'm going to assume you know you need to read plans, and they are in your notes?
---
That's honestly not surprising. It's still upsetting though that they fail to be properly transparent about the stuff that needs to be transparent. I mean it's a somewhat big deal, since I basically wasted my supply drop for not knowing that this change was a thing. I did it like before and took my sweet time before collecting it. If I know that it can be stolen and I'm too late, shame on me. If I don't know because it's never been disclosed, shame on Bethesda.
---
Turning in Tech Docs to Camp Venture has a chance to reward you with BoS PA paints and outfits.
---
Its hardly a game news outlet. He makes commentary about the industry and thats it.
---
Even if he is wrong about the e f2p thingy, who cares? Dude is just stating that it might be possible, not that it is going f2p.
---
Bethesda actually already claims thatit is not going free to play. End of story.
---
Also if you dont know, there is random spawn of BoS outfits in That Antique shop near watoga. If you server hop you can get whatever BoS costume you want.
---
Agreed. Let‚Äôs hope we don‚Äôt get it a year into the game‚Äôs development 
---
Legendary armor as event rewards or from legendary enemies in the event? I ask as I've gotten armor as rewards but never legendary armor. Best rewards I've ever received have been plans. 
---
The other day I did a whitesprings loop and the golf course was filled with lvl 1-5 eyebots for reasons unknown to me.  I got a bunch of lvl 1-5 legendary gear, and actually fast traveled to the handful of lowbies on the server to chase them down and give away a lvl 5 anti-armor hunting rifle and some one star armor pieces.  It took me a long time before someone acknowledged my lvl 130-ish character wave and trusted my "come here" emote to look in the bag at my feet.  Shadowed heavy combat armor, a camo combat helmet, goggles and a veil of secrets is probably not screaming "friendly".  Maybe I should spare .20 weight to keep a mild mannered suit and hat on hand to give off a bit less of a "professional killer" vibe.
---
You assume you know the opinion is a million people?
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs some garbage tier hubris you‚Äôre swinging 
---
It would certainly up the amount of pvp in the game.
---
I‚Äôve received flare guns and drills and I‚Äôm 100% disappointed they weren‚Äôt 3 star legendary. I‚Äôd totally use a explosive drill or a two shot flare gun 
---
Drink them all at once. But yeah I have max thru-hiker and the first traveling physician and when I'm "empty" I have about weight about 180/255. Using the weight system is annoying when used to metric because have 180kgs on you and being able to sprint is ridiculous. 
---
I will take it.
---
Be warned, while in the stash it can be auto-scrapped if you are low on whatever material it grants when scrapped. It‚Äôs on their fix list for the next patch, but be careful til then. 
---
I was in the middle of pvp battling for a workshop when Grahm's mumble could be heard. We both stopped and ran to him to see what he had. Then carried on fighting for the workshop. 
---
Your downvoted more likely for being a pompous clown
---
So what are you doing on this sub?
---
Yeah even had to give away my Bunker buster as soon as I got it because it weighed 43 pounds
---
And sweet rolls
---
The Scorchqueen actually died before the quest came up once! 
---
Thats just awesome. Hope i run into you!
---
I see differences between with and with out using a chem, a food item, and a drink item for charisma 
---
Sell? Cmon dude.. ill give you a few for free. Fusion cores are so common, just need to know where to farm them.
---
Psn; paulofg1980
---
I gave "The Quartering " a chance and "The Hype" Honest both have been in the industry before trying to hype train and shill for a  moment. Sad to see them both wallow in a cancer to favor. Sucks for them. They had potential.
---
"I thought news sites were supposed to post/print credible news?"
---
Well, CNN is supposedly real news too.
---
Basically, do your own damned investigations if you want real news, because almost everyone is beholden to some form of financial support, including the big abc news networks.
---
ah nothing special. just a mutie not wearing anything. (I should've put a video tag, my bad)
---
You're right man, i had no idea lol. I wasn't quite at your level of hoarding but i wasn't great. Ammo was my thing - had thousands and thousands of 10mm, 5mm, .44 that i was holding on to just in case they give us an update which allowed it to be scrapped and reused. When i broke i ditched it all in flatwoods. Hopefully some new player hit the jackpot.
---
98 fusion cores is insane by the way haha. Think i have 15. 98 is nearly half the stash limit!
---
I think when this bug happens it‚Äôs just not recognizing the mats in your stash,so just pull everything out, and it should work!
---
Well its the creation engine being used since Oblivion. What you name is exactly the problem: The engine is not designed for heavy multiplayer use. For instance every item has its own space in terms of memory and processing down to a single bullet. This is a choice nobody would make in a multiplayer because way to many objects need to be processed at the same time. Having dupers superloading characters enforces this problem. 
---
If the dupers cannot be removed for whatever reason why not putting a limit on the amount you can carry? ie twice your max weight. This would drastically limiit the dupers and also the amount of objects that we have on the server. Thus resulting in a much better overall performance of the game.
---
Probably an attempt to slander the game
---
the same I do everywhere else: being realistic and objective. personally, I like the game. I probably played it more than most people here.
---
but that doesn't mean I'm gonna circlejerk about it, cover my eyes and downvote negative thoughts away.
---
Nope, I have enough levels saved up to fully respec twice. I decided it would be more fun to just make a few tweaks then make a new character for a different weapon class. Plus the 25k cap max is a bit low, so I need an extra char anyway to store the excess caps. 
---
Magic acid land would like a word with you
---
You can get legendary armor even as event reward. I got once (maybe twice) legendary armor at my level even for fist ever event you met at flatwoods. Which is kinda stupid, getting 50lvl legendary armor for killing 3x lvl5 protectron and using some computer.
---
Also there are events like completing silo, scorched earth, maybe monstermash and some more, that will every time reward you with legendary combat armor. (Thats why everyone is using combat armor i think lol)
---
Yeah you get legendary armor as event rewards. I got like a level 1 or 5 Chameleon piece on a new alt I made from I think the event in Flatwood. There's also the Alpha dog one with the 3 packs, they drop low level legendaries also. Then there's Watoga Monster Mash. It's a higher level event. It drops 1 star legendary Heavy Combat Armor pieces sometimes. Though people have said the top reward for 5000 candy is just a random 1 star legendary. Hardly even worth saving them. Though a lot of times events and stuff just give a normal armor piece which really sucks. Also I was saving a bunch of treasure maps, then I did a few and it gives like normal armor pieces. Hardly even worth carrying to scrap. Though I did get one or two plans I didn't have already. So still worth doing I think. Would be nice if everything was a lot more rewarding. More 2 star and 3 star drops from things that matter. And more 1 star drops from things that don't.
---
Yes! You really needed preparation before going in. It felt like going to a truly dangerous place.
---
In f76 there's nothing like it.
---
Lol sorry didn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt understand; I meant more I didn‚Äôt explain it well enough. And yeah I‚Äôm like that with ammo too but only for the weapons I have. I have 20 thousand plus of .556 and .45 lol. 
---
And for he cores, I just served hop and kill the sentry bots at white springs there‚Äôs usually three patrolling. 
---
 Call me old fashioned, but I use youtube to find stupid music videos that make me laugh, and sometimes reference videos for stupid quests in videogames. 
---
 Anything else I don't really bother with, unless someone actively wants to show me some clip of something...
---
I guess just unsubscribe/block/report?
---
Nuke his base? Lol
---
I could ask the Interloper to tail him for you... 
---
bs damage.
---
I couldnt agree more.
---
Not only that, all the idiots that throw out grenades and strike beacons that heavily lag the server...DONT USE GRENADES WHEN FIGHTING THE QUEEN!!!!!!
---
the main design fail of this game is the inventory system:
---
1. too much different item, like at least 5 different type of beer bootle. and other junk is just pointless. u need them as scrap why not loot them as scrap simple??
---
2. too much diffrerent amo. what for? when need amo for pistoles, carbines, and energy weapons 4 different type not 30. and its all. but there is 4 different claliber for only pistole. FOR WHAT???? and u can't scrap or sell unwanted amo.
---
they should make junk weigthless at least in stash... and we need a huge at least 5000kg stash incrase for gear and weapons.
---
What the fuck. Did anyone worry about this?
---
Did you visit all locations of the game? It takes quite some time and some areas are awsome.
---
Message me GT themisterphenix 
---
just google it, i spent half a minute typing on the search bar and reading through the first article that came up, shouldnt be that big of a problem for you either
---
The problem is he reported a lie as truth, EB Australia is pulling copies of 76. He didn't follow up on his source, and took what he admitted was two anonymous people on the internet saying something and ballooned it up to the point where both EB Australia and Bethesda had to correct the record. That's a serious credibility problem for someone that wants to be considered a news outlet. And other "news" outlets parroted it, and named him as their source.

Explosion damage. Fireproof perk and dense armour mods will nerf the scortchbeast scream attack. Happy hunting!
---
I really don't understand why they don't at least add some normal objects in the Atom store. (not the super shiny clean vault objects, but dirty used objects) If they take some pre-existing objects and also create some new ones and add them every few days to the Atom store, it will stay fresh and much more Atoms will be spend. It should not be a lot of work to add more items.
---
They just need to go back to the old system.
---
Literally the worst, most painful part of the game.
---
In every previous Bethesda title I could fire up console and player.modav carryweight 10000 (and use a good inventory mod) and never again have to worry about stupid administrivia in a game.
---
20carry is a weigh of any heavy weapon or a simple handmade...
---
When I was connect to AOL online I think I knew her, she was a swell gal. Alway sent a   {s drop}  when I arrived.

start posting this and they will nerf it.

---
I agree, making those apply to stash too would make them a ton more useful and less frustrating
---
LOL.  I do this all the time with maybe a 25% success rate at Watoga.  Most of the time they either ignore me outright or are too busy to give me the time of day.  Their loss, I guess.  I'd say 99% of lvl 100+ players ignore me (I'm lvl 138 or so) and 50% of -lvl100 actually stop what they're doing to acknowledge my squeaking noises.
---
Haha it's fine man, i'm intrigued by your hording habbits. 20 thousand ammo is crazy too haha. I'm forever habving to craft more so i've never more than a thousand of what i'm using.
---
Sure you already know this but have you tried powering up on of the power plants for fusion cores? I did Monogargh for the first time recently and it was a revelation. No more farming 23/100 cores for me!
---
Are there any places i have to get to whilst low level, in order to get items i otherwise couldnt?
---
e.g. to Harper's Ferry vendor to buy the handmade plan before level 44
---
100% agreed - I don't want to pvp, any way whatsoever, I don't play in team, I want play solo, fuck the griefers/raiders/assholes who destroys someones base. Open them separate servers where they can wreck each others, but allow other players to have fun without fear of being constantly harassed..
---
Unless they give us PvE they are failing. Fuck PvP, Its broken thanks to the blantant abuse and distribution of TSE weapons!
---
Awesome. Any perk requirements (apart from 'Slugger' of course)
---
I dont think i articulated my question properly. 
---
I am interested in the builds above, for 2 characters, and wanted to know what perks are essential etc and if there are any perks that are overpowered in these builds
---
I've called this BS out too many times. Glad to see an official statement
---
There's a difference between saying "the game has bugs and other issues that need addressing" and propagating a complete lie and building it up to the point where both EB games and Bethesda has to correct the record. Criticism is fine, and needed. Spreading misinformation is not a simple criticism, it's malicious.
---
The carpets don't match the drapes in this post. 
---
I came in thinking this was about extending pacifist mode not just save you from PvP but make you and your stuff invulnerable to it. However this is really about BGS and others not doing anything to deal with arsehole players after reporting them.
---
Thing is is it really ruining her stream? Cause you make me want to know who she is so we can watch to see how bad it is. Of course, not to contribute to the griefing.
---
Bloodied should beat Anti-Armor at about 79% hp. Furious maxes at about +30% damage after 6-8 shots, which is a bit better than Anti-Armor, but it does need the windup and the single-target focus.
---
I don't agree with the nerfs either. But at this point you have to ask if this game is still for you? I put fo76 down a week ago now and honestly feel great about it. 
---
You simply cannot play an rpg if they keep "moving the goal posts" with endgame. 
---
I didn't spend 100 hours spec-ing my character to then need 200 hours respec-ing it. 
---
Its dead, move on.. 
---
I found a tin foil hat in an outhouse today. Had to wear it in place of my beret.
---
I think forest, ash heap and the mire are great atmosphere wise. I felt really uncomfortable exploring the mire because of lack of light and visibility.
---
Toxic Valley was underwhelming mostly because there's barely anything to do there.
---
Savage Divide was fun to explore but its s bag of mixed thing and nothing stands out. Only the raider presence makes it unique, and their presence is confined to a few camps scattered across the road near top of the world. To the south its a random pool of locations and enemies.
---
Watoga/cranberry bog was cool the first few times I went in. But it exhausts really soon, because the landscape is all the same (damn tenches!) and after level 60 the danger feel is gone.
---
Im level 83 and I walk around cranberry bog like its my house.
---
This sub needs a dedicated team to debunk all these hoaxes... really its getting silly.
---
Makes you wonder why the Brotherhood wasted all that time and resources trying to find a way to combat the Scorched plague. The answer was staring them in the face all the time; Send in the invincible shopkeeper Phoenix! 
---
He might take a while doing it with his paltry dps but by Gawd he will take down anything the wasteland has to throw at him eventually. Single handedly saving Virginia whilst flogging you your 457th consecutive Ivory Grip mod.
---
Just starting condition of item but not the quality of legendary effects.
---
Smashing, this sounds exactly what i was thinking of. 
---
Any tips for:
---
\- overpowered perks for a melee build?
---
\- Best early weapons?
---
\- Where to find powerful melee weapons e.g. Super Sledge?
---
That‚Äôs beside the point. There needs to be a better passive mode and I gave you an example to why exactly. 
---
The funny thing about that is that I called this guy out for using a tse, and he said "lets do melee". Dude, I'm lvl 11, my best melee weapon is a lvl 5 hatchet. He pulled out a sacrificial blade. My other character is a 143 unarmed build. I should have rolled up on him with my instigating, +40% heavy attack, +1 strength death tambo. I guess the whole tse thing rankles me because it's so over the top against low lvl toons.
---
I think that's level 15-25 actually
---
The eye of Sauron sees all. 
---
A dude came to me in Excavator power armor to my camp acting as a vendor, he also used my camp to rest. I used 600 caps (i think) to buy a Two shot explosive laser rifle from him. Best deal i've made so far, sadly the laser rifle constantly broke so i dropped it near the R&amp;G station. .
---
We need more people like this 
---
It wouldn't be a problem in itself if the server infrastructure wasn't so minimal (mvp syndrom).
---
MY NIGGA WILLAM PENN
---
Huh?
---
I've taken to noting down the stuff I already have in my old cheat notebook. It can be difficult with some CAMP items though, as they're really vague(for example, chair variant 1, chair variant 2, etc. and there are multiple of the same name in different rows and the plans are named something entirely different and equally vague like Plan: Wooden chairs). Fortunately I didn't aquire that many plans prior to beginning the additions to the notebook, so now every time I pick up a plan I note it down if I don't already have it noted(whether it's a duplicate plan or not). I may still get duplicates with the really vague stuff, but hopefully this can save me from that more often than not.
---
All that being said, something in game to tell you before buying whether you have a plan would very much be ideal.
---
Don't let us trade, just make the prices not ridiculous
---
Burning is reapplied, not stacked. I think the same goes for poison and bleed. But you can apply all 3 at once (somehow) for maximum damage.
---
It's bullet sponge ville. With no endgame. And a nerf hungry community right now.
---
funny story, the quartering got beat on by a dude at Gencon last year bc of his hate speech he spouts. got his ass whooped in front of a ton of people, and acted like a little bitch about it. even made a go fund me for his fake hospital expenses. if i ever meet in IRL i might punch him just on principle. 
---
In Fo4 if refreshed the effect rather then stacking if I remember correctly. Given that it‚Äôs the same engine there‚Äôs a very good chance it acts the same way.
---
I spend half my time running round trying to find where he has run off to. They really need to leash him
---
I‚Äôm nervous to put in the time and then get disconnected. Plus with the amount of junk I have on me I don‚Äôt want to pvp because if lose it all, I‚Äôd kill someone lol. 
---
Happened earlier tonight actually. This guy with a 10 wanted bounty asked me to kill him so I did he said thanks then came back and one shotted me. Took all the junk I had and hopped servers. Spent the last 4 hours farming it all back, and ended up with more than I originally had. I‚Äôm a nutcase. 
---
misinformation? the same type of "misinformation" gets spread around for literally every other game.
---
and calling it is misinformation is inaccurate. Fo76 is an online game, and lots of online games with disastrous releases go down the f2p route sooner than later. so that's something that will always loom over the game.
---
coupled with the fact 2 major retailers were acting sketchy towards physical copies of the game, I believe it's justified to notify people about it. especially if they were planning on buying it.
---
It's a shame really. Such a good fun game destroyed by the bad press.
---
Followed
---
Please do not stab other customers, while they shop 
---
Yeah I know how to read my plans 
---
Burning like fire
---
How can you close and fail?
---
How can the light that burned so brightly
---
Suddenly burn so pale?
---
One world, the game would never be playable if that was the case.
---
There are currently two problems. 
---
1) Bobblehead stacking
---
2) TSE being handed to all players 
---
Both by dupers. What should have been done is to remove the stacking of the bobbleheads and rebalance all weapons and enemies because of the bad design. In the endgame the high level enemies are way more powerful requiring way to much firepower unless you have a melee build all the rest of the world is too easy by then. But instead of rebalancing properly the endgame weapon tier gets nerfed into dust. Why? Because its so much easier. Plus you get all the players talking about this and not about the missing content ;)
---
I fucking hated that mission... I'm not even american, the whole DMV  "joke" went over my head until someone pointed it out to me.  It was just a full on waste of time, I had rather fought through a mob where you had to steal the certificate from the boss by killing him. 
---
When you buy a mod, it doesn't immediately apply to your item, it is an item itself which you can apply to the item in a workbench as you would normally craft it (it will say 'attach mod' instead of 'craft' and cost nothing, but you still need the required perks to craft the mod to attach it)
---
I‚Äôm having a hard time thinking of something I‚Äôd rather watch less than some stupid ass motherfucker talking about video games on YouTube.
---
All gravy no downvotes here... 
---
See that hadn't even occurred to me that you must have all your junk on your person, not just in stash. Luck of the draw really then the power plants. I've been lucky to avoid pvp.
---
That's just cheap from that guy. You get it unfortunately. 
---
I have a question for you actually. One thing i can't seem to find enough of are RadAway's. Any tips on farming those? Been unable to find the damn plans.
---
- you could as well remove the SPECIAL cap for perks, why bother at this point ?
---
- for the 2nd and 3rd points, it's all about what a multiplayer game is about. Game mechanics should push forward player interaction (team combat, crafting, trade, roleplay...). But with omnipotent omnicient armageddon lv256 destroyers scouring the wasteland, all this is useless and we're back to square one on solo online play.
---
"Puny Human."

"Ow, my head."

Yikes
---
Honestly, I just genuinely like Grahm.  I haven't gotten anything useful from him in a long time, but I always like to see him and Chally Moo-Moo.
---
A few days ago I caught Chally being beset by some Scorched on the northern outskirts of Watoga.  I killed them and ran after Chally until he/she caught up with Grahm around the power station that always has a deathclaw vs ant fight.  I walked around with him for a good while, all the way up the road to around Harper's Ferry before getting booted from the server shortly after an SBQ nuke.  I kinda wanted to just hang out, hear all of his dialogue, and figure out his route.  
---
Here we are hanging out.  [https://imgur.com/avImOwG](https://imgur.com/avImOwG)  You can see his head turned to me as he's talking about greens or meat.  
---
What have you guys done... Now I'm scraping all cosmetic outfits I'm getting my hands on... Most of these items don't even give you any components. What am I gonna sell now...  
---
I‚Äôm surprised that only that much less health is needed for bloodied to beat anti-armor for SBQ. Just curious if you did the testing yourself or found it somewhere else?
---
So would I be correct in assuming a handmade bloodied with adrenal and all relevant rifle perks + nerd rage would be better than anti-armor?
---
I believe I have most places uncovered. I have all those location challenges completed, minus those that are bugged. My favorite area has to be the Mire by far... so creepy and full of character. Have you been to the Crashed Plane? Such a cool area, yet so little to do. I did find a safe and a secret door that needed secret codes to open them. Still no codes... I wonder. 
---
I would say bloodied, because aswell as being able to use perks like serendipity, to help avoid damage, and nerd rage, to buff damage, you can also use unyielding to buff all perks except endurance. I personally run bloodued with 20% health, enough health to make the perks work and enough health to not be one shot by most things
---
There are multiple servers you can be on.
---
12 players per server.
---
That will probably go up in the future.
---
Because you are not a daddy.
---
Okay. So at level 50+ levels mean basically nothing. 
---
People get one shotted regardless of their level for most people with good builds. Level 50 or level 3000, you‚Äôre not surviving a 1500 Damage punch to the dome. 
---
It‚Äôs a raider style of play. They‚Äôre taking advantage of the fact that you‚Äôre a hoarder who is taking over a PVP zone. It‚Äôs a wasteland, not a carebear hug fest. 
---
Also console players dont have mods to help manage stash weight.  So we need something 
---
I am seriously thinking about it as well. Me and my group I'm playing with (roundabout 20 Players). And as your post shows we are not alone being frustrated by bad design choices. 
---
It's the other way around.
---
Blood Lust Mode activated. Your death is inevitable. 
---
I think OP's point is that these kinds of people are feeding pure bullshit to a massive fanbase. If it was just some cancerous clickbait youtuber I'd be happy ignoring it and leaving it at that, but then we get people spreading false bullshit to further their delusional hatred, which in turn creates far more hatred from people who don't play the game or know very little of it. Then we get people going out of their way to type up stories like "I got my base nuked by 10 people today fuck this community" or "I have a female character and I had 50 people one-shotting me outside combat saying they're going to rape me bethesda please help!" And some people here actually believe these stories and it's just a toxic cycle that continues forever because in the end, that brings in the clicks and the ad revenue.
---
Lol, you caught me, he does call me that occasionally but not on this occasion, I am a father of 3 though and he loves to watch me play 
---
By "acting sketchy" you mean how they didn't actually do any of the things that Quartering said they did, and called bullshit when asked? Yeah, incel neckbeard is a real consumer advocate totally looking out for all the poor 1st world gamers with all that horrible privilege. I mean if somebody bought this game a week before it went f2p, they might have to wait a whole two or three weeks to buy a new game! Now I'm not religious or anything, but I'm pretty sure even Jesus would be humbled by that caliber of personal sacrifice.
---
I once watched a dead Deathclaw hump a truck until it exploded and launched the carcass on to the roof of a farmhouse in the Toxic Valley. The first time I ever wished I streamed my game play.
---
Well, let's be honest he's a bit of prick. I'm loving this game, and I really don't give a shit about his opinions, if he doesn't like it then fine, but if he's criticizing people and spreading lies just to try and hamper other people's enjoyment, then he can fuck right off.
---
*And I'll be there to Tricentennial salute his ass away into the fissure*
---
This is one of my favorite songs. Hope it goes/went well!
---
This would'nt be so bad if the game wasn't so poor at communicating about inventory management (without mods, console player).
---
The pipboy interface needs a serious overall. Maybe BSG game designers should play some other games that fallout 1-3 someday.
---
Yeah I got pissed off but that‚Äôs the game,I guess. It is what it is. 
---
Yeah for Radaway it seems that a lot of the ghouls at Whitespring drops them. I keep having to drop them because I end up with over 100. So I go to vault 76 and leave them in a bag out front. 
---
24 players*

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4zwla/z/ebisxir
---
Absolutely.  The problem they will have now is,  do they put resources into this, or will they be better off putting those resources into developing some other game that may be more successful?  They have to weigh the opportunity cost of devoting talent to FO76 development.   They also need to consider that the FO76 players are worth keeping happy, if they ever want to sell us any other games.  They need to run all the numbers and I'm sure they will - but after all, this is the company that misjudged the readiness of the game so badly that it got some of the most epically awful reviews and has a reputation as a trashbag full of bugs even among people who don't play games!  So perhaps their calculations are a bit poor.
---
Pretty much the same goes for The Elder Scrolls. 
---
And this is why I've started taking rumours with a grain of salt. Most if not all of the time these rumours turns out to be bait made by YouTubers and people who are in general still against the game.
---
So next time a rumour about a glitch, exploit, etc. pops up, I'd encourage you all to take it with a grain of salt. 
---
Also lead
---
It makes them have higher durability which is pretty nice tbh.... Finding nice legendaries with 1 luck would kind of suck because that's how you get puny little condition bars that need constant repairing. 
---
Answers from a level 83.
---
1. Does anyone actually buy items from other players? 
---
Theres no scarcity in the game that makes trading with other players a necessity.
---
I never bought anything from other players.
---
And I still dont understand how the so called duppers were able to sell duped items.
---
1. Are there plans for every type of weapon? I.e: railway rifle, war drums, choice other non buffed weapons
---
I think so.
---
2. What is the max level a player can get?
---
I think its unlimited. But you can only build your character perk until level 50. After that you get cards but to use them you need to replace cards from your build.
---
3. Can you craft buffed weapons or armor? I.e: chameleon armor, explosive ammo
---
If you find the plans and mods yes.
---
4. Since energy weapons are significantly harder to come by does this mean a max suited energy weapon will be better than a max suited ballistic weapon? 
---
Apart from the gauss rifle which benefits from rifle perks, energy weapons are kind of weak in this game. Same with plasma guns.
---
Stick to ballistic.
---
We need pvp and pve servers that's all i can say on the matter. Those who want to grief and roleplay raiders can go do that to each other. While us that wish to follow the story and lore of us rebuilding America and stopping the plague can do so.
---
Unless you hear it from the horses mouth don't believe it.
---
Exactly.
---
Might be the one after next, but yeah they confirmed that player vending is coming (fairly) soon
---
https://youtu.be/J1iNInn7Y80
---
They already announced this... 
---
No. But still patiently waiting 
---
Can I do this on PC? I'm lvl 23 rn but once I'm a bit higher, I'll gladly fill your boots and weild the chainsaw myself.
---
That's easier said than done. I worked hard to collect all of them, and I'm not going to basically throw them away that easily.
---
The OP admitted it 
---
Your level dosnt matter, the amount of people that attend the event matters.
---
I don't know why this would be worrisome.
---
In a world with Electronic Arts, that's unfair
---
I saw him spawn beside the tree by the road in front of Lakeside cabin on PC just this afternoon. I was on a roof of one of the cabins and shot at him about 4 times, then ran over to see why the super mutant wouldn't die. It was Grahm. I saw him spawn in right beside the tree. 
---
I really don't understand why it's such a hard ask from Bethesda.
---
All they need is set rules on each server type with an option to join pvp or pve servers when you click play. To pair you with 23 like minded individuals.
---
If you join off a friend then your choosing to join their server choice.
---
I'm a mod in her channel. This has been going on for 6 days. They nuke her camp, grief her even if she doesn't engage in PvP, and follow her around through server hops (even though she has blocked them on all platforms). They also target any of her friends or followers that game with her. They even stream it themselves (for all of their 2-12 followers/viewers), with one of their streams entitled "How to stream snipe 101". We hopped into their stream and they were bragging about giving her name to their guild/clan. At this point, the only ways for her to prevent this is to "go dark" quit streaming and change her gamertag, along with all of her friends; or for Bethesda to fix the PvP Griefer system. Another solution that could be implemented by Bethesda would be to institute PvE servers along side PvP servers. Also giving her name out would not help the situation. 
---
&gt;By "acting sketchy" you mean how they didn't actually do any of the things that Quartering said they did
---
but they did do, at least at the time it seemed like they did. that's the whole point.
---
&gt;I mean if somebody bought this game a week before it went f2p, they might have to wait a whole two or three weeks to buy another new game!
---
see what I mean? this sub specializes in justifying shitty behavior on Bethesda's part.
---
&gt;nobody cared about the canvas bag before. what's deceptive advertising?
---
&gt;Bethesda didn't produce the rum, even though they had to sign off on the design of the bottle.
---
&gt;what server crashes? never happened to me.
---
You can place foundations in water. There just has to be ground near enough for it to actually reach the bottom. I've built whole floating towns.
---
You can technically place them under water if you wanted a walkway.  You can't out anything else in top tho 
---
Solutions:        
---
        
---
We should get 8 Weightless Bound storage container that allow players to store 8 things in it regardless of weight. This allow us to store some of our heavy 15+ weight weapons without holding the Stash box hostage.        
---
          
---
Increase player weight limit by 120.         
---
Increase Stash limit  by 300.        
---
         
---
Reduce Armor and weapon weight across the board. 
---
I've stopped all missions until I find this guy. It's not going well
---
I‚Äôm not sure. Hopefully,  it will come to fruition because it‚Äôs frustrating to watch someone destroy your base until they get a bounty over 1,000 caps and then you kill them and get nothing for it because they purposely log in with nothing on them.
---
I always love watching the nukes touch down. Like one big firework display. Get close enough and you get the wind effect of everything being blown back. It's quite the experience.
---
Oh, I know I can put foundations in. The problem is that you can't attach walls to them,  even if the top of the foundation is well out of the water. It's just annoying and kills a lot of possible builds. 
---
I estimate, with a million players farming, every 15 minutes someone should find a TSE Handmade. That's about 70 days x 4 per/hour x 24 hours/day = 6720 randomly dropped TSE handmades so far. 
---
This thread is a piece of work for sure. 
---
I believe crafting cards should be baseline once unlocked as well.
---
If it was actually called "passive" mode, then I might agree.  
---
But it's not. It's pacifist mode. And just like in real life, being a pacifist means that you can't/won't hurt someone else, but nothing stops them from beating your ass if they so choose.  
---
That's literally the exact opposite of a shill though. 
---
They can: [https://imgur.com/a/yO9UGqI](https://imgur.com/a/yO9UGqI)
---
lol he made an educated guess thats all, he was presented with evidence that many of us saw as them preparing to go F2P, he never claimed that without a doubt it was going F2P he just stated his opinion on it
---
I didn‚Äôt see him in weeks then I saw him twice in 2 days. Once in Lewisberg and Harper‚Äôs ferry.
---
I get no less than 3 copies every time and yes spend 20 mins breaking it all up. 
---
Either this or hunting for elusive PA mods. I'm hopping for an Excavator's Calibrated Shocks plan/mod for weeks now.
---
I haven't met him het and I feel empty
---
and then you chose to type up 30 words being a dick instead of just saying "explosive damage." 
---
ESO's a bit of a different case. It was meant to be a sub game, but they couldn't sort that out with console platform holders (Microsoft particularly to my recollection).
---
Whatever they intend to do in regards to switching up monetization is probably quite awhile off though. And if they're smart, they will be going well hard at polishing up the game (that even those of us who enjoy(ed) it all have to admit is more then a little rough and probably needed a much greater beta) and get that "Redemption" PR cycle going before they actually do much to drastically alter the value for early adopters.
---
Wouldn't be surprised to see '76 being a PSPLus/Xbox Gold freebie a year out from release though. Which is effectively free to play, but lets you kind of handwave it because it was a limited special deal, even though those are near universal (the trophy tracker for Destiny 2 for instance, has like 20-30x the number of vanilla players after it was on PsPlus vs the Forsaken expansion at the same time).
---
Not sure if you can rebind drop, there is a lot of keys I wish I could rebind but it isn't an option for PC.
---
I never scrapped a frame with parts on it always afraid it would scrap the frame and parts.
---
A friend of mine swears that this might be true, and runs around Watoga with 10% health and a full set of unyielding (+3 to all stats except Endurance) armor for legendary farming.  I've run with him many times.  I have 7 luck, he has 20+ luck, and there doesn't seem to be an appreciable correlation to the loot table aside from base item durability.  The stuff he gets always has a fantastic durability bar, but he seems subject to the same RNG loot table that I get.  A very rare 3 star spawn seems to net us an equal chance at an actual 3 star item, which seems to be 33% or less.
---
Aside from the durability, he is definitely not getting "premium" affixes to his drops.  Two-shot and instigating are definitely not more common for him as a 1 star affix, and he easy has 3x my luck score.
---
Yeah that.
---
What are ya buyin‚Äô?
---
If you've played for a few good hours you got your money's worth. If you aren't having fun then you should try something else, you know? It's just a game 
---
Well, YOU may know exactly how its done, but it happens LITERALY every time I move my camp in 3x copies. If its something I am do ing, and there is an option to NOT do it, I would sure love to know, because I loke to build camps a lot, but I refrain from moving my camp because of this. So if you know exacly what causes it, please share lol. I sure would love to avoid it in the future seeing how its happened every time I have ever moved my camp since the first patch. PC player. 
---
It better have fast conversion rated because that bad boy isn't gonna stay in the hands of one player for more than 10min and it would be annoying to defend. I was disappointed in the ammo factory spawn rate and the fact you had to worry about it constantly, I find it much more useful, less resource intensive and fast to craft ammo myself.
---
Which is why I keep saying that PvE servers would be great for players like me that want to enjoy the game without worrying about raider-style players. ;)
---
Same as I man. It's just plain bullshit and people should see this coming from far away.
---
Min/maxing is fun though!
---
Scrapping armour and weapons to get mods gave me RSI and made my eyes bleed, then no way either to easily see what mods we have collected. 
---

When? I was in Eb today. Still on display and for sale along with a heap of merch
---
Yeah. You think I don‚Äôt play now. This game goes FTP I‚Äôll never play again!
---
I never got the fun Mothman sneak thing.
---
I logged on earlier today and heard my turrets at my CAMP going nuts. I run up and see a giant moth being hammered; it was basically dead before I even got involved. Pretty underwhelming
---
I might be wrong, but misleading costumers from a certain product using lies and "rumours" is an economical crime. He could very well be suited.
---
And all those others spreading false information that might affect sales. 
---
It's the plans. The whole sheet is plans and plans for mods with the exception of some mods without plans like x01
---
I honestly avoid the hate train for 76. I use to jump to its defense whenever people started bashing on it but no matter what you say there no use. It's become a bandwagon and most people havent even played it to rightfully judge it. It's not a bad game, I find myself enjoying the game, more than 3 and 4. Sure it has its issues and everyone comes across them at one point. But sadly once ign or some ridiculous trending youtuber post their ' I played a whole 10 mins and here's the final verdict' review, all you will hear are others repeating the same lines they heard without ever having looking at the gameplay once. It's good to hear that theres someones still out there calling people out on their shit though and defending the game. Someone's got to do it.
---
Who is he shilling for? And it kinda is his job to shit on the game since it's the hot ticket for views and likes atm. Can't really blame him. 
---
I like to wear the clown outfit with a sack hood. I‚Äôve never even seen a chainsaw though.
---
This is a great idea.
---
I think this could be mitigated a bit if things like turrets did high player damage once PVP had been triggered. There would still be many other corrections that would need to be done of course. 
---
There was never any proof to it. It was nonsense to begin with. This is like celebrating the scientifix paper that proves gravity exists. How the fuck do you manage to rollercoaster this to the slander's credit?
---
&gt;but they did do, **at least at the time it seemed like they did. that's the whole point.**
---
Because a guy said they did, without evidence. And in reality they didn't do it. And EB corrected the record, because the guy started a rumor that they did, without evidence. And had to publicly refute it, because it was a lie.. That you believed, because you believe everything you want to be real. And don't care about reality.
---
Talk shit get hit I guess lol
---
We need to add, how to research news, into education for kids. Too many people see a story and don't question the source, the motive of the writer, or just the validity of the information.
---
It's also a lot of older people too, but they are not going to change their ways at this point. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem accurate. I‚Äôve built camps out in the middle of the water with no way to get in unless you have jetpack + marsupial. I built it out from the edge near land until I got out to the middle then deleted the walk way to it. It‚Äôs like a castle surrounded by a moat. 
---
TLDR mate. Workshops open you to PvP, that's the whole point of them. If people are being jerks to you online, *go somewhere else online* for god sake. Block and server hop.

Please no more bundles. The only outfit I‚Äôve ever wanted was the Santa outfit, but it was only sold in a bloated bundle that had nothing else I wanted. So I did not buy it and life is awful now.
---
Why one earth people even belive in stupid rumours at all. You can pretty much say anything on internet and som sucker will belive it.
---
I work at a video game store and the amount of people that shy away from fo76 because of you tubers or critics without even playing themselves is mind blowing.
---
This man gets it. I play daily and I‚Äôm having a blast. Then I come on here and I‚Äôm like damn this game is toxic. Then I just go back and play my game. 
---
I watched some mobile camp videos on YT today for inspiration and currently am doing a 1 foundation build. I start with one foundation, stair up, floor, stair down, floor, and then you can build a whole floor from that with walls attached
---
Yeah that's how I want an inventory increase rather than a flat Stash improvement.
---
Other things I want: 
---
Mannequins: Display Armor + 1 Weapon   
---
Caravan Stash: At the end of each day items in this stash will be distributed to vendors (Maybe to a faction of your choice?)  
---
Magazine Racks + Bobble head display
---
I see how you believe this is the only answer to your current situation. These people are harassing you n your friends I get that it‚Äôs frustrating to have to endure especially after your requests for blocks or bans haven‚Äôt been met but this is really the appropriate option. I think passive mode should be expanded to include not allow you to hurt others camp stuff n not hurting friendly robots (whitesprings)  while active. The whole aspect of PvP in this game seems like a last minute add in because of the popularity of fortnite. They wanted to cash in on the battle royal market. That‚Äôs why we were given a half assed passive mode because it was always meant to be gimmick. The core mission is to rebuild America by working together. That means interacting with other people. We are the characters in this story some good some bad most are somewhere in the middle. I‚Äôm sorry you are dealing with a bunch of idiots but you should focus on customer support to help in this instance. 
---
For me it's not about defending the game. I just enjoy calling people out for blatant bullshit. I enjoy FO76 for what it is (but I haven't played for months due to getting a TSE auto-rifle but no end-game to use it on), and Bethesda have fucked up so many times lately I'm surprised they haven't been fined for breaking GDPR and other EU law, but these charlatan YouTubers really grind my gear sometimes.
---
The two different locker plans (with the same damn name and cost) apparently spawn at specific vendors according to that awesome redditor who made the plans post last week. 
---
You should be able to buy the one you want if you check that post, I can't seem to link it on mobile. 
---
[He seems to backed out of that claim](https://youtu.be/p7VBNRlBjmA)
---
My point exactly, and i therefore have to pass some treacherous areas like On Top of the World, which always seems to have Super Mutants at levels 25-50.
---
No problem, I can only hope that Bethesda implements a better system into the game that prevents it. Thanks for the kind words. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Just a heads up, if you are a melee char, there is a magazine which reduces melee weapon weight by 75%. And if you relog before the timer runs out, it refreshes (same with bobbleheads). Sadly (ofcourse) there isn't a magazine that reduces gun weight.
---
For the rest i think a lot of the weight issues come from the experience of playing previous fallout games because they more facilitating for hoarders. Fallout 76 in that respect is imo more meant as survival game.
---
That said, once you got a nice stock of junk mats, there really is no need to farm them actively. Set a limit in your STASH for junk items (100 or so, unless you are planning to craft full sets of PA). You won't need Pack Rat if you aren't going to farm junk.
---
Set a limit of all chems you actively want to carry and sell the rest (i keep 5 of each, except radaway and stims).
---
Built a water purifier at your base and you have all the purified water you'll ever need, keep a few on you and otherwise you can go back to base to drink. Or make soup which covers both food/drink.
---
Lastly i'm working to an unyielding build, which, in theory, gives a lot of STR, aside from any deep pocketed you may use.
---
It's sold as "Plan:44" I've seen it at a few different vendors. 
---
I've had this happen a few times in a few different ways. Sometimes if I open my map or pipboy too quickly consecutively I'll have no HUD and no ability to open my pipboy or move. It's happened enough times recently thats its gotten annoying.
---
As we don't know how many people are playing simultaneously, we only can guess how many servers are online. At Release there were for sure thousands, later on there will be a few hundreds. 
---
you people want to justify false advertisement and I'm the one who doesn't care about reality?
---
the evidence was the fact that, at the time, two major retailers seemingly had stopped stocking on physical Fo76 copies. that's hardly news-worthy except Fo76 is an online game, and I hope you understand what a disastrous release entail in this case. those are all facts. 
---
you're basically saying that people shouldn't report on rumors even though literally every other industry does it. if gaming stopped doing it, journos would basically be out of a job.
---
So the armor plans for the T-45 can be found anywhere in The Savage Divide and The Mire?
---
by posting this your just getting them the only thing that counts for youtube, interactions and views. only way to amke an issue go away is ignore it. even dislikes are not a bad thing unless they greatly outweigh the upvotes and are in the 1000s.
---
Went past the 10 minute mark explaining himself and trying to twist the story into "but now I have a insider in Bethesda I can ask about ES6 when the time is right!" when all he had to do was delete his old video and say "I'm paranoid and see conspiracies everywhere I look, sorry for spreading false rumours".
---
Well I have seen this as well, but they all just dropped, Lead, Aluminum, steels, and cells.

Thanks for your sacrifice! Most outfits don't sell for much anyway.  
---
Only a few are worth selling: ski outfits (lots of them near Top of the World, and the cabins where the vendor is), straight jackets (Penitentiary and Fort Defiance), Civil War Era Suit/Dress and a few others.  
---
I can craft the Civil War Dress (I found the plan, didn't unlock it) and sell them for 26 caps I think.

---
Completely agree, I want to be able to have more than 3 weapons and 2 PA in my stash
---
I built a camp there, pretty sure in the exact spot you are talking about. The same thing happened, tried 3 times and just moved. The far side of the lake down by the border at the ledge, Little Rock Island there. I think there is just an issue there where you can build but the game has it tagged as out of bounds. I had the exact same experience. 
---
Someone played Diablo III a lot, definitely agree with the idea

My question is why Chad has to always shit-talk the other bots at Camden Park.

The other robots might be ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù to you Chad, but they have hearts of solid gold.
---
I won a fight against a TSE dude. But I admit I was lucky because it was a fight in close quarters. So I ran up on him and he couldnt fire the tse without killing himself. Thats the drawback of all tse weapons. It only works with a distance.
---
You are correct though. The use of legendaries in PvP should not be permitted since there will always be imbalance anyway but since a high level has a much better probability of aquiring one the encounter is never fair between high and low. 
---
Oh no, you still need to do something

Yes, it's a nocturnal.
---
Yeah, luck and int don‚Äôt really seem to affect your character other than increasing your perk card slots. Kinda disappointing. I think that luck is supposed to increase how full the durability bar of looted items is,but that seems entirely not worth it.
---
The coverage of Fallout 76 is getting ridicoules at this point.
---
CleanPrinceGaming, Jim Sterling and Dreamcastguy are only a few that butcher the topic for clicks.
---
You're wrong, at least in the states. Publishing information that's wrong is not a crime. Publishing information negatively affect sales is not a crime. 
---
For there to be a lawsuit they (Bethseda) would have to prove that they maliciously spread the information with the express intent of harming their business. To do that they'd have to have enough proof to have a judge support discovery and then find some sort of express proof (him shorting stock, or emails saying 'I'm doing this to harm their business and I don't care if I'm lying Muhaha).
---
Literally, the only defense you need is to say 'Your honour, I believed what I was saying was true.' and case dismissed. 
---
But they were just that, "rumors". He didn't know whether it's true or not, he said it's a rumor, and you are not really supposed to believe rumors
---
I second this!

I'm just running around with a [candy cane](https://imgur.com/IrqANQW) and pistol, but I do my best to optimize within constraints.

Nah, see it's a little thing called journalistic integrity. If you just straight-up lie, why should we believe you about everything else? I watch the video of his way back in the beginning of December, and he claimed it was the last one about Fallout 76 he was going to make, and yet a few days later here comes 5 new videos about Fallout 76. he is literally just trashing the game for likes and views, not to be honest about it or actually report what's going on. now, it doesn't matter how honest he is with other things that I don't like, or how much he dislikes them. I'm going to purposely avoid his channel, and if I click on one of his videos by accident I'll go ahead and leave a dislike.

Well respect for being able to stand listening to them and their bullshit, and for calling them out. These idiots will say/do anything to be relevant. Its mind bottling sometimes to think they have an audience that believes every word out of their mouth.
---
It‚Äôs a cool tidbit, but I think it serves as motivation for how the war played out the way it did. Not that is necessarily IS a simulation. The guy was unhinged and had incredible power. That‚Äôs how a nuclear apocalypse happens. 
---
There is also one in the wooded area northwest of the ammo factory.  Also, there is a locked trailer with power armor around there.

That's how almost all Xbox one games work though. You download the game even though you have the disc. 
---
Had an interesting glitch with him recently where my turrets opened fire on both me and him. He is unkillable so every time I returned to my base that day a few more walls would be torn down. He just sat there getting endless shot as he tore my house down board by board. No hard feelings though, next time I loaded in my turrets went back to normal.
---
That‚Äôs what happens when Fallout 4 is an 87 metacritic game and Fallout 76 is a 52 metacritic game. That‚Äôs an almost unprecedented drop off in quality for one game from the same developer. Usually when you see something like that it‚Äôs a completely different studio taking over and dropping the ball, like with mass effect andromeda. Except Fallout 76 makes andromeda look positively well received, lol.
---
The next Fallout game will not be ordered in such high quantities by retailers. Bethesda will have a long way to go in restoring their reputation for quality, if they ever do.
---
Welcome to a big part of what makes fallout games great. This is why the suggestion that no human npcs = no story bothers me so much. The environmental storytelling by them has always been great, and it keeps being great in 76.
---
It's always my right leg that breaks. Everything else stays pristine, but my right leg constantly takes damage. 
---
Yeah, a lot of game series go from 87 metacritic to 49 metacritic in the space of one sequel, definitely doesn‚Äôt imply that the game was a failure or disappointment in any way.
---
Since I literally, not even exaggerating, spent 6.5 hours at the DMV the last time I went there (just for a routine renewal), I actually found the quest oddly pleasant. I didn't even have to wait in line every time I had a new form. üòõ

I agree, I feel like me being the one to learn the story instead of npcs handing it to us makes me actually pay attention and look for small details and appreciate the small things that tell a story a npc couldn't do

Because we‚Äôre still using the fo4 engine. That‚Äôs why. 
---
You‚Äôre not wrong about gamers being easily manipulated and circlejerky (including this sub which is a huge echochamber about an almost universally critically panned game), but I have to wonder who you think is paying people to bash fallout 76?
---
If gaming reviewers are all paid off why did previous Bethesda games score so well and this one so poorly? If gamers themselves are paid off and astroturfed then why did previous Bethesda games have favourable user reviews and this one with terrible user reviews?
---
Pretty sure "the left" and liberals are the same thing
---
Hmm maybe I just don't care as much as other people. Looks like party is over anyways, OP collected his karma and dipped. 
---
Clean prince gaming is a douche too, I work in construction and we have a motto that you can pick any job apart. That's why its policy that we dont talk bad about other people's work in front of customers,  real constructive criticism is vital to success, but when it comes to this toxic contempt for every game and every move these game developers make I want to scream! None of them have probably even worked in game development, or going back to my line of work; just because you helped your uncle put a roof on his shed one summer 5 years ago doesn't mean you know how to roof. I'm not saying 76 hit a grand slam on its first pitch, but it's a damn enjoyable game if you give it a chance. I'm lvl 199 right now and I still find myself putting in a few hours every day, and I own most of the other AAA titles that are out right now. 
---
Dog food is my staple as well. I love that perk card, just found out about it when I checked my unopened packs from a while ago. I definitely recommend this to anyone !
---
Nope, only molerats and radscorpions never lose "danger". You can stand in front of wolf/dog/mutant hound with egouth agi.
---
HOW MOO MOO DOIN??
---
#1 is just lag. I have seen it a lot since launch. #2 I have never seen before. #3 Yes, I removed the perk card because of this. #4 Yeah I see this constantly. Pc Player
---
What about the lever action?
---
1,200 caps
---
Yeah, fallout 76 being a good 30 points worse reviewed than any recent fallout game clearly has nothing to do with quality 
---
The reviewers must have just been paid off. Oh and the people who played the game and didn‚Äôt like it, and who left the game in droves, they were paid off too. By some competitor of Bethesda no doubt. The alternative that the 52 metacritic game is simply a bad game is FAR less plausible.
---
Omg the candy cane!
---
Yes there is a perk card for mod card under intelligence I believe.
---
It might make you a bullet magnet.
---
BEEP....BEEP....Don't shoot! I'm human! I'm human! Oh the Humanity!
---
There are milions of people that play Fallout 76. A world can barelly fit 24-32 players without feeling like they stole all my good loot. It would be literally impossible o fit all the players on just one map. We can barelly play with the limited stash and camp budget as it is. And we constantly need to server hop because all the good loot is takened with just 24 players on the map. This game was never designed for large gatherings of players because it is a competition for loot.
---
...why are people so surprised about this? The game was universally panned and got like a literal 50 metacritic score. One platform was 49 if I recall correctly. Is this sub such a massive echochamber/support group that people convinced themselves it actually wouldn‚Äôt matter? Why do they think investors care about metacritic to begin with?
---
If its power smith i already have it equiped at max rank, anything else I need equiped??
---
Don‚Äôt know anything, but good find !
---
Idk..
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Yeah his checks bounced when he was ordering swag items. Lol could be worse!
---
The issue with that is repairing/crafting/building requires so many resources, you don‚Äôt have a choice but to pick everything up. Not to mention you unlock mods by scrapping excess weapons and armour, so you‚Äôre forced to pick even that up. 
---
I‚Äôve got no problem managing inventory (plenty of experience with DayZ) but in a game where you need to pick up everything, it‚Äôs just not possible. 
---
It even happens when you‚Äôre in tents. 
---
No Problem.
---
Hey just a tip for people!  You can place items much easier if you are standing above the coloumn and looking down at it.  I fiddled with it was was able to place several plants on it this way.
---
my all rise goes up to 400 sometimes but then at some other times it‚Äôs at 290 or 350. radicool of course changes it but most of the time i have too little rads for it to affect anything, i thought maybe teams affect it but i havent found any cards or anything that could cause such a huge change
---
Thanks. I'm going to try this. :)
---
Oh i‚Äôm a dumb dumb I forgot about the perks
---
It received this level of exposure, and ire, because it was from a company and a game series with a reputation for quality. People were excited for it and hotly anticipating it, so when it turned out to be a 50 metacritic dumpster fire the reaction was expectedly severe.
---
If you took the exact same game and made it an indie survival title with no big name IP or marketing dollars behind it you would have never even heard of the game, it‚Äôd have failed quietly in obscurity. Triple A games don‚Äôt fail quietly.

I have met him at deathclaw island and Lewis berg, I believe if you follow the main highways you will come across him 
---
Is it worth it anymore 
---
I agree with you fully. Not having a pve only option actually is discouraging people from playing together. Lower levels run from higher levels who want to help them. 
---
I know I've converged on areas where other players are and they flee. I even get nervous checking out someones awesome camp because I dont want them thinking I'm going to destroy it. 
---
The other day I stumbled upon someones camp in flatwoods. It was called Little Lmaplight in neon letters. The cutest fallout 3 nod I ever saw. I walked up to look around and they logged off. 
---
It really sucks. I want to play and engage with other people but everyones so skittish because you never know who is just gonna wreck shit. 
---
I get that pvp fits the lore. In real life youd come across dicks who want to wreck your stuff and kill you, but this is a multiplayer game about rebuilding. We should be able to enjoy that aspect peacefully. 
---
Have you considered that at only level 32, you have barely seen much of the game's content to be able to accurately judge it?
---
I‚Äôve found Watoga city to be pretty good. Just keep doing laps, the robot pods keep spawning robots and occasionally 3 star legendaries. Only problem is I seem to find 90% armour pieces, rarely weapons, but surely that‚Äôs just bad RNG and BGS hasn‚Äôt actually reduced weapon spawns to combat TSE duping etc. right? RIGHT?!?
---
Tennessee Ernie Ford smiles down on you.  Good choice if you have a low voice....
---
ok .so from what ive been told the only reaspn we have a budget is so that Bethesda's servers dont overlod and crash.. as far as im concerned.. bethesda needs to fix it.. there shouldn't be a budjet.. or a limit to what i can do inside  my little bubble.. you at the moment can have a fully fuctional(encluding turrents) or yo can have a really nice house that can be trashed by pretty much aybody or any amlnimal that walks by...  i want a beautiful house with the work and 8 functional missle turrents so that even a scorched beast will think twice before attacking ... yeah we're complaining... they are limiting our potential... our imagination..  our way of life....
---
I'm with you and many others on this. I didn't get this game to play inventory management. I got it thinking it would be a somewhat typical Fallout experience (specifically 3 and above) where my stash size doesn't matter and I don't have to carry around everything I might need. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with practically all the weight reduction perks purely because I can't stash what I need to.
---
This is gonna be a long read for anyone brave enough but I don't want to start another thread when yours already has visibility and I want to be clear on why I need almost all of these weight reduction perks. Ultimately, and I guess this is the tl;dr of all of this - it's lack of stash space and a lazy solution to that. We all need more stash space. 
---
Travelling Pharmacy maxed? Check. Thru Hiker maxed? Check. Bear Arms maxed? Check. Bandolier maxed? Check. Batteries Included? Check. Junk Rat maxed? Check. 11 Strength points, 3 Intelligence points, 3 Agility points. 17 out of 50 points just because their backend can't cope with a usable stash size. 400 was pathetic, 600 is slightly less pathetic but I think we need at least 1k to be able to play the game without having to waste so many points just on weight reduction perks. Here are my reasons for why I have so many of them and I suspect others will have similar reasons.
---
Travelling Pharmacy - I need it because RadAway and RadAway: Diluted \*STILL\* take 0.25 weight each, I need Disease Cure and Antibiotics because any diseased thing just has to look at you for you to get a disease you can't ignore (extra limb or radiation damage etc), Stimpaks for the obvious, chems to boost damage and resistances which seems to be pretty pointless as extra DR feels worthless.
---
Thru Hiker - I need water and food because of Speed Demon, and because I have Carnivore it has to be meat. The best meat usually weighs a lot.
---
Bear Arms - This is the one that irks me the most. I might only want one or at most two heavy weapons (one will have 90% weight reduction) but because we all have so little stash it's just a better use of stash space to carry the heavy weapons and have them weigh 1 or 2 each instead of taking up roughly 20 - 28 stash space. I literally have 3x miniguns, 2x Fatman (one is Daisycutter) launchers, 3x .50 cal guns, a Gatling Gun with 90% weight reduction and a Gatling Laser on me taking less than 15 weight total. Excluding the weight reduced weapons if I had just one of those in my stash it would be at least 20 stash space gone that I could use for valuable crafting mats.
---
Bandolier - I think it's obvious why I have this from the heavy weapons I use. I'm a heavy weapons user and the smallest ammo count is 250 for the .50 cal weapons. One SBQ fight can, if it's going badly, use a few thousand rounds easily. Due to stash limits (again) I can't store ammo I need because it would take up so much space. I can't even store that many materials to craft ammo because they also take up a lot of space, especially Prime ammo because nothing reduces the weight of stable flux!
---
Batteries Included - Until such a time that Bethesda fix it we're still stuck with the game abusing any Fusion Cores we have in an unwanted order. I have way too many cores on me currently at near 40 but looking through them makes me so angry. I have at least 25 of those with 80 - 99% use remaining. I have to use Power Armour just to stand a chance of getting around sometimes and I wanted to use Gatling Lasers and Gatling Plasma weapons but they're a giant waste of time for other reasons.
---
Junk Rat - I hoard. I won't be alone in this and even having to do the ultra slow walk at times because I need the materials won't change that. It's like a repeating cycle. I need ammo and mats to repair things. I go get mats. I weigh too much to fast travel and I can't store it so I make more ammo. Invariably I run out of one material first but usually lead or steel. Then I overcompensate and end up with too much but it's hard to just throw it away after having spent the time to get it. The only slight upside here is that if I have no junk (rare) I can free up those card points briefly.
---
I found it hysterical. But it went pretty easy for me. (Easy being no glitches, bugs, or crashes) 
---
This is the reason i stopped player after the first month or rather when they fixed the carry weight glitch.
---
The glitch made me realize how much the joy i have from playing increased when i didnt have to manage the fucking carry weight every 5min.
---
The system is just really bad and way too punishing and should be way more lenient like in Fo3 or Fo4.
---
Honestly, before they weight economy isnt fixed i wont come back and since it doesnt seem like that will happen, im out. Its just no enjoyable.
---
Try putting all the materials you need in your stash box before trying to construct the mod. I‚Äôve heard others tried that and it solved the problem. 
---
Took maker in real life myself. I thought they should have had one of those drill/mill/lathe contraptions. While I could be just fine drilling or even milling with only one precision axis, there are times you need a lathe to turn something. Would milling more than one pass suck ass? Yep! As long as you have good tools for layout work, you can eyeball a scribed line to about 5 thousandths. Having said that, they pushed it to theoretical limits with the single axis benchtop mill/drill. 
---
Just give us PVE and PVP servers please.
---
You need weapon artisian
---
Yeah, the karma farming on evil EA posts is past silly.
---
Exactly, I go to flatwoods and vault 76 all the time and try give lower levels free water, building supplies, food etc. and 9/10 they run because of not wanting to die.
---
I mean with how horrible the weight economy is, 20lbs is barely one or maybe 2 guns... thats literally nothing.
---
Andromeda got a 69 metacritic, it‚Äôs practically citizen Kane compared to the 50 metacritic fallout 76 
---
It most likely has to do with retailers likely ordering way more copies of fallout 76. Fallout 4 was an utterly massive commercial success, they would have expected fallout 76 to be in at least the same league sales wise. Fallout 76‚Äôs universal critical failure is almost completely unprecedented in triple A games. A triple A game with a metacritic in the 60s (like andromeda) is an utter failure, one with a metacritic of 50 from a developer previously known for 90s is unheard of

I hate schorchbeasts
---
Stimpacks Does too
---
&gt; vendors with more caps 
---
I would prefer they stay at 200 caps but replenish it more often.  Seems like 90% of the time I visit a vendor they're already cleaned out.
---
Aw. I'm xbox but I would have joined üòÅ
---
That sucks a little but awh well haha 
---
In Fallout 4 I managed my inventory for 4 minutes in 4 hours. In Fallout 76 it's 15 minutes every hour. 12 strength, ALL perk cards for reduse weight. Noice.
---
This bastards too, I forgot.
---
Desperate youtubers need more click bait 
---
Then they shouldnt be able to pick up your loot bags. Some people need to be killed.
---
My ornery booze hound character also needs this.
---
Would also be nice if the drunk buff lasted more than 2-3 minutes when you chug a full bottle of moonshine or vodka at least...
---
That‚Äôs another point I have though in the past. For PvE, bags are only accessible to those who dropped them. In PvP, looting a bag initiates combat, 
---
Could you imagine it with like 64 players?! Last few days I've been randomly counting players cos (bored) and Im only seeing like 6-8 ppl on any random server at any given time. I only saw 24 ppl on a server right after launch.
---
Have we found them for January/21/2019 to 1/28/2019??
---
I build a lot as well, and every time I login and I can't put down my camp I go visit the location to see other people's ideas! 
---
Curious as too how Anti Armor scales with the Queen, as her resists seem to increase exponentially when other players are in the area.    
---
Seems that at some point AA might pull ahead of even bloodied.. 
---
Yeah I'm on PC :)
---
IGN is NovaCrimsyn, feel free to ad me! What's your IGN? (I usually ignore friend requests if I  don't know who is sending it.) 
---
long time fallout fan since Fallout 2. Played the "beta", hated it.    
---
I can already see the downvotes which will only prove my point.
---
Exactly. I suppose you could theoretically turn a small pistol barrel on a mill if you chuck the part up in the spindle and stick a lathe tool in the vise, but rifling it would be nearly impossible in a mill.
---
Consoles VRAM can‚Äôt handle this
---
The fact that this is a thing that can happen is beyond stupid, thanks so much man!
---
Upstairs of Morgantown Airport, there is a door locked with a terminal with an holotapes within...
---
That reminds me, my favorite youtuber's best friend works for Bethesda, and he said they regularly are instructed to give a picture of a Fallout 76 customer's face as well as their home address to trained assassins as a blood sacrifice.  Hopefully spreading the word will get an official response from Bethesda because I bought Fallout 76, and I don't want trained assassins coming after me. ^^^^/^^^^s
---
Ah the girl who shoots herself cause she locked herself in. That was sad ;-;
---
Do you know which helmet that is in #52?
---
Great album btw, looks like a hell of a journey.
---
I've seen a fair few in my travels lately, hopefully something to do with the vaults opening soon.
---
Weapon condition most likely
---
yeah its like buying roulette sometimes i saw tesla coil once in other shop i think it was a train station in north and didnt buy cause no clue for what .......
---
I'm surprised it doesnt, considering both spacesuits in the game do.
---
Not 100% sure what your saying?. Is it an issue of not been able to do the silo by yourself?.
---
What is your platform?
---
dude literally no one trips over each other to launch nukes unless it‚Äôs on purpose to be an asshole. what server were you in cause in the handfuls of times i‚Äôve launched nukes, no one has tried to contest it from me. and after u launch endgame or whitesprings several times, you get bored and stop launching altogether. it‚Äôs now rare i load in with a blast zone or someone actually in the silo. even if someone launched, its a short cooldown. and there‚Äôs 3 of them. 
---
Vampiric 10mm pistol when it kills npcs, it gives you health.
---
She has a stream of a game that allows for base destruction.  You don‚Äôt get to have it both ways.  Don‚Äôt stream your base location if you don‚Äôt want trolls smashing it.  In no way am I gonna feel sorry for someone who is trying to make money playing a video game. Go be a knight somewhere else.
---
There should absolutely not be PvE servers.
---
Why do you think there are so many people ding melee or shot gun builds walking around in excavator armor?  Because shot guns and melee are both strength perks so people invest in them and then go ahead and max out strength to make the game less tedious. 
---
   If you sink nine points into shot gunner, or slugger etc, then add on pack rat and strong back, you have a build that is doing  a shit load of damage and rarely is over encumbered.  Excavator armor adds 100 weight on top of that.
---
If you 15 points in perception with 3 strength you are going to struggle.
---
It's pretty terrible the way Bethesda balanced the game.
---
Modern technology cant handle such an enormous task as ulimited stash in MMO. It's just beyond the ability of humanity to create such marvelous peace of code.
---
WizTree is better.
---
People hardly move their camps anyway, especially after they have built a good camp in a good place in late game.
---
This was suggested many times before. But seeing as Bethesda never picked up on it I dont think they will change the card fumbling. 
---
What? You can kill legendaries outside of nuke zone and get better loot, than in some fkin whitespring. If you get tesla, put pacifist on, you can also get hits on all ghouls and let other to kill them. [Silos are easies solo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBPrSO0w7As&amp;t=6s) I do not understand, what is your pain, can you explain, what triggers you?
---
It‚Äôll just be 10.00 to play by this summer. 
---
Then that‚Äôs your opinion. I however want there to be specific servers because it makes sense. 
---
Be careful with Endurance food and Well fed on a low HP build.    
---
    
---
Lets say you have 255 HP + 50 HP for well fed. You are running about on 20% HP for unyielding / nerd rage / adrenal reaction mutation.      
---
That leaves you on around 60 HP. Youre fighting away and take 10 hp dmg... then Well Fed buff drops.. you now lose 50 HP and die.    
---
I happened to me so often that I now avoid eating to max for well fed, and never eat END food. 
---
It's really a big middle finger that switching cards is so clearly intended to be part of the game and yet the interface makes it a chore rather than fun.
---
The same could be said for most of this game, however. The interface is on a suicide mission to ruin any fun you may be having. With a mouse and keyboard it seems like the game wants you to be using a controller. With a controller, lots of functionality is simply missing. Everything takes longer than it should, especially the most tedious management stuff.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't work that way.  Mods are replaced.
---
The reason we don't have unlimited stash is because Bethesda's servers aren't unlimited or free. If they didn't pay a monthly fee to keep the servers running (part reason why the micro transactions exist) then we would have all the space on the interwebs. All of the stuff you have is stored online not on your hard drive and someone somewhere has to store it. I couldn't imagine what google pays to borrow server space around the globe... üí∞
---
Thanks hun x
---
No you didn‚Äôt.  You are just crying because some streamer girl you like is getting properly wrekt.  If she didn‚Äôt stream this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.  That‚Äôs her choice and she should expect the results that come from that.
---
Seems like they're going off every time they can in my experience. :/
---
No idea but I feel like I'm trying to find a patient that has gotten outside when he's not at his post. Usually I'll find him slowly 'walking' back to the shop or picking a fight with some no-good punk kids.
---
Unrelated - whoever came up with the protectron model and that awkward as hell walk animation should be punched repeatedly.
---
Okay, have a good day.
---
30 Luck, still getting shit drops
---
lower levels? cause usually after you do them solo a few times or in a team u get bored doing them. u basically just wait till someone else does it so ur like ‚Äúoh i guess i‚Äôll do this.‚Äù 
---
I feel like it needs to be said every week or so and eventually they might listen
---
I can sell you Speed Demon for 500 caps if you‚Äôd like. 
---
For anyone who sees this, I can make all of them. 
---
It worked?
---
I heard they‚Äôve dropped for the queen but no luck for me. I have my two mutations that I want now. Just was curious how you stumbled across them. 
---
Fire in the sky
---
when the game hit sale on black friday some guy was convinced it wasn't because they couldn't move copies of the game, despite none of it's peers being on sale. it was ridiculous... and again when the game cut price. to be honest free to play is going to be the only way the game survives, assuming they have the will to stick around and fix the game instead of just quietly abandoning it and moving on. and so far i remain skeptical.
---
Well, at least painting of cats makes it bearable.
---
I could, if higher levels didn't keep coming in bumping up the difficulty. @_@
---
Im on pc, now I'm just making myself more angry as I've broken my weapons and depleted stimpaks and ammo. It's partly my own doing I guess. 
---
Well Fed and endurance food expiring. Kills without warning. Happened to me loads before I worked it out.     
---
Dont eat over 50% of the food bar to avoid well fed - or eat constantly to stop it dropping below 80%. 
---
Simple solution. Buy them an account or copy of one of those games. Let each dev get some time in on it before building an MMO. 
---
Hell, there‚Äôs features from an old browser based MMO (runescape) I wish were included, and I played that shit like 15 years ago. 
---
"the items" may not be stored on my hard drive but the assets for them sure as heck are. CAMP builds notwithstanding, all that's in your stashbox from the server's perspective is a list of shit. That doesn't take up much space unless I really misunderstand how this works. (feel free to enlighten us all).
---
I can't seem to find a gap. Been at it two hours now, and it seems to be a consistent issue across servers for me. Maybe just bad luck. 
---
I can‚Äôt honestly say I‚Äôm opposed to twitch thots being griefed. 
---
Flapping heard nearby,
---
Oh please don't make me kill you,
---
Here we go again!
---
or
---
The Donuts of Doom,
---
Begone you flapping sky beast,
---
You're not worth my time.
---
Awesome tip
---
I agree, I‚Äôve never bought ammo and doing an ammo run couple times a week and with shotgun shells most of the places I farm most of the enemies are running shotguns but ammosmith and super duper are a must
---
So fireproof perk and dense armor will remove 100 percent of scorchbeast scream damage? 
---
And that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt opened the game in a while....
---
Yup, and now begins the hunt for more violet flux
---
6 months from now people will still say Fallout 76 is going free to play based on these rumours and Quarterings video. Even tho it was disproved afterwards. 
---
Outrage crowd still comment on this game like its still in the same place as it was on release. And close to none of them have even tried it. They just parrot what their fave youtuber said.
---
probably, cause damn i have never had that problem. maybe once, they launched on the SBQ 3 times. but nothing after that. :0 when u become a higher level you‚Äôll load in with higher levels mostly. they‚Äôll all be bored as hell with it 
---
You know that special doesn‚Äôt keep growing after 50.  What your really saying is that anyone who hasn‚Äôt grinded as long as you doesn‚Äôt deserve to fight the queen.
---
What needs to be fixed is the scaling.  Not ban all the players taking part in a global event that you want to keep for yourself.
---
Exactly - since I've settled in quiet neighborhood, with nice view and short way to all shops, I build my base to max budget and not planning to move it.
---
Melee weapons repaired over 100% gets 30bonus damage.
---
&gt; People don't like Fallout76
---
I don't actually think this is true.
---
People like to not like Fallout76.  Hating on it makes them part of an in-group.  (Of course, not hating on it also makes people part of an oppressed "minority" which can also be fun).
---
The vast majority of people in the world, hell, the vast majority of gamers, have no opinion on it at all.
---
They are not on the list.  This is not that game.
---
On PC.  On PS4 it's a real DVD.
---
Laud scream
---
I lover my weapon
---
I am tired
---
I see and hear nothing
---
Super curious about this too!
---
And for the legendary properties, like after the nerf hits will we be better off with TS or Anti-Armor Cryos &amp; Flamers?
---
And do most enemies have much resistance to Cryo &amp; Fire dmg to begin with? I don't have the Perk that displays resistances or anything so idk if most enemies have armor against them in the first place, let alone enough that it needs much dmg to be penetrated. Anyone know more?
---
Unyielding in insane in crit/melee builds, but melee requires at the very least 1 lifesaving part as you will be a glasscannon by doing so. Bolstering is amazing if you are unsure about your build and use mainly rifles/guns.
---
You found anyone ? I d be happy to participate if you did :)
---
Sadly.
---
This is so wholesome! It's a great idea to go out of your way and provide an interesting and fresh experience for other players just for the hell of it.  It's also a prime example of a fun pvp experience, especially because you waited for their consent (looking at all the raider RPers who justify their own amusement with lore). 
---
Well, the fact that you've played it before making your decision is better than most who complain about it.
---
You've earned the right to have an opinion on it.
---
Who cares, main thing is transfer the message
---
If YongYea did a video about it, it would be titled "Bethesda NOT making DISASTROUS decision to change Fallout 76 to a Free-To-Play model" and the video would still be mostly negative coverage about Fallout 76.
---
Just wear it for special occasions
---
Is that because unyielding improves strength so much so it‚Äôs perfect for melee?
---
And as far as bolstering, what makes it beneficial for guns?
---
The Raider was raided. All that's left of his once sturdy power armour is the frame.
---
Each item is logged in a database. It's usually assigned a GUID. They take up space in said database. The system has to run queries on those GUIDs. That takes processing power. If there are millions of GUIDs running around that are crosslinked to accounts, players, etc, well, I think you may can figure it out from here. 
---
I have not, I didnt feel like doing the silo, that gets old after about 50 times, but I would have helped in the Queen fight. But Im off now.
---
My weapon has broken
---
My armor too
---
When your max weight is like 200 and your doing perfectly fine with only armor weight reduction 
---
Dont worry friend. I will be on xbox tomorrow upholding his namesake.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen the infrastructure. But a sure see what is happening in the game. The bad design choices create problems that are unnecessary. It‚Äôs always bad if you must scale up because your code design wasn‚Äôt done properly. The duping and exploits are happening because of this. 
---
I only buy physical copies if its gifts to others. Like birthday and christmas. Or if i can do a really good bargain, something that rarely happens on pc. For pc the best deals usually are online.
---
You put any points into luck?
---
Seems like everyone is 70+ I'm only 33.
---
It's been extremely frustrating the entire way up too. Fighting normal enemies, then suddenly they get super spongy. Then, surprise! I'm fighting lvl 62 ghouls! Ugh. 
---
ah, yeah it sucks, tag them actually, and let the higher levels kill them. u get all the XP. that‚Äôs one way to look at it
---
It's honestly a great idea. Though I've avoided trading with random players ever since the news about the trade-stealing bug surfaced. 
---
I think the exact thing I need friends so we can do that roleplay
---
Me and my 5 year old girlfriend live by that philosophy.
---
Seems like it has already been nerfed, things I could take with 1 shot now require 3-4 good hits and I am using twice the ammo to take down a SB.  Not complaining as it still seems pretty fair overall, just a bit more of a challange.  Now if they could just fix Bobblehead stacking and  orpses disappearing before I can loot them I would be real happy
---
Awesome. Good luck. 
---
It's not really as much about storage as it is about server stability.
---
Just like you 
---
You‚Äôll start getting bored around lvl 85-100. Creatures start dying after like 9 shots of most high powered weapons. Even medium weapons seem overpowered at some points. Future content seems a mystery as so many people are still hacking and duplicating :( who knows what‚Äôs gonna happen next :/
---
This is the perfect comparison, once you know who Grahm is... I was approaching the airport and was momentarily petrified at hearing the voice of a supermutant. Then, I started to make out what he was saying, and I saw he and Chally the Moo-Moo. They are precious. Despite my initial fear I'm glad to have run into them, and I think they are my favorite npc encounter so far. (Making tea might be not far behind, though)
---
Actually I'm quite sure the RR bot is also hostile to the other bots, it's just that they spawn less there and that he is kind of trapped in that room for most to notice. 
---
&gt; do your own damned investigations if you want real news,
---
Yeah that works out great for all those Qanon feebs.
---
You can get that outfit in the atom shop.
---
Just got vampiric hammer yesterday. And I have melee build, lol. I basicaly tank mirelurk queens in melee now.
---
P.s. It will be awesome if beth would have added shields to the game. It will be so much fun to use car door as a shield in power armor. Because right now melee players have no way to protect themselves from ranged attacks. And damn... this would have been cool to have perks like "metal turtle" for making shield wall.
---
All he admitted was that 7yo did not use Daddy on that occasion...
---
I found it strange too - some of my pieces I can paint Prototype, while other not, even though I've learned all the plans from Enclave archive. 
---
marketing god/industry insider here folks.
---
It'll happen to you, too, someday. Probably someday soon. &lt;3
---
I don't think anybody cares about those codes anymore to be honest, they get decoded in like a day anyway. 
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/448/448/77f.jpg
---
This is actually an important thing to discuss because it could mean that Fire and Cryo based damage does full damage regardless of Armor pen, unless the target has specific resistances towards them.
---
Well add us and we can play when ever!
---
Didn‚Äôt know this thread was a thing. Thank you for posting these. 
---
So far (level 54) best gun I have.
---
"Fairfax, bring me my wallet. Yes, the small one. Now hurry up, good lad."
---
Fallout 76 perk system is probably the only thing in game which works good. No need to change it, it perfectly fine. You prrpare for the fight by equipping needed perks, while in camp you equip oteher ones. Perhaps it will be nice to add perk presets for quick and easy change but no need for permanent perks, in my oppinion. I dont like having alts.
---
Good find :) I've stumbled on a few so far too but haven't noticed a 'story' attached to them and am just assuming they left like we did but died.
---
I also found a Scorched lying in the road who was wearing a Vault Tec jumpsuit: [https://imgur.com/z6yiiY7](https://imgur.com/z6yiiY7) 
---
A level 33 bitching about not doing a silo solo.  You complaining little baby, take your ass to do some quests or something and level up!  Then you no complain anymore ok?  Oh, remember, play stupid games, win stupid prizes! 
---
BRONN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I mean, I can kill them, it's just a massive ammo sink. It seems like it's everywhere I go too. I fight more over leveled baddies than I do my own range. I wouldn't mind if they weren't killing my ammo and breaking my melee weapons every half hour of play. It's really killing my willpower to see this game through.
---
For the silos though, hitting a sentry bot nearly twice my level out of nowhere sucked up a chunk of stim, then two assaultrons finished me off. That happened three times, the last time my weapons broke, and I was too aggrivated to continue. :|I was so preoccupied with getting it done I forgot to repair them. 
---
Content was pushed back because the amount of bugs they had to fix. Going f2p wouldn't really add much benefit and could be harmful to the player base, making the atom store their primary source of revenue. What do you think happens then?
---
A fast travel point being pretty much anywhere with a location marker, if people have to travel further distances they also have less incentive to be assholes. 
---
I think PVP is senseless because it comes out for me as any other pvp game where you just infinitely spawn until you have the most kills or an objective is met, I would have liked to see something more interesting than that.
---
Oh look! The 89347589375th f2p post.
---
From your first comments, it sounds like you want Japanese Games Companies to design a game about nuking the world...
---
And that's when I stopped reading.
---
Show me.
---
&gt; You know, since if those posts weren't made we would not know the official answer.
---
Monkeys in zoos throw shit at visitors.  The zookeeper puts up a sign telling people to stay back.  Do we thank the shit throwing monkeys for the sign?
---
Have a good night then !
---
they should just start a server with no weight limit for stash boxes, but limit the number of players on that server for testing.
---
Or they have already did?.. Because some glitchers have unlimited weight carry on their characters. :P
---
Ah, very interesting. I know what post you're talking about (I just didn't read it thoroughly, apparently) so I'll be able to find it again. Thank you very much for dropping this knowledge on me!  
---
That's, uhh, a pretty heavy rock there. Might want to get your spine checked.
---
But seriously, it caused a massive uproar. Summary is:  someone on this sub posted "fo76 is going free to play". Several YouTubers used it to get views, but that spread the misinformation like a wildfire. 'journalists' wrote 'articles' who's only source was... The one Reddit post that... has no source.
---
Oh, yeah, the OP admitted it was a social experiment.
---
Right? Like *are* cryo &amp; fire actually separate from Energy Resistance? Are most enemies basically armorless against them, or is fire &amp; cryo resistance super common?
---
I'm going out on a limb here, since I'm not at all proficient with the relevant technical details, but it might help if scrapped and bulked junk has a separate, larger limit, seeing how every player has a selection of these - it's not like a legendary three-star gun with a bunch of exotic mods and a paint job, which has a ton of values attached to it that also change if the player looking at it has certain perk cards equipped. Junk should be relatively straightforward and thus take up less processing power to calculate - the only crucial value would be the amount - which should still be capped so the ingame economy won't suffer more after the duping disaster.
---
Look man, I'm not here for a flame war. The enemies are perfectly killable on proper scaling. My complaint is when a lvl 103 comes in and it adjusts for their lvl and not mine.
---
You really shouldn't have to do a straight up 100 hr grind just to finish one quest. 
---
thanks for clarifying.
---
Like I said, a hard item limit would be fine by me. I'm sure it costs comparable computing power to keep track of large, valuable items as it does small, trashy ones. I (like many players, I'm guessing) would happily give up 10 junk slots in stash if it meant I could fit 10 extra heavy weapons or armor pieces, know what I mean?
---
Does it matter at this point? Let's be honest the game isn't fun it was a waste of money. This isn't what we wanted and this isnt what we should have got.
---
IIRC that's the exact reason the OP of the FTP thread gave. A social experiment they said lol.
---
I'm sure they are easy in true solo, but I cannot get at them in true solo. I get a bit of progress in, then some higher level dudes come in and the game scales to their level. 
---
This sums it up.  Also a good question to OP, what DO you think happens then??
---
Everything True to get those tiny boosts for accuracy and long or medium barrel. I also invested in skeet shooter 3.
---
There might be other options for mods with skeet 3 but haven't tested yet
---
The sad thing is that they probably don't want all-PVP servers because their victims would fight back. They get some sick satisfaction from wrecking players who can't defend themselves. Thus upvoted.
---
It does effect what's below. It's a sphere. My current camp is build off the edge of a cliff and the levels that go below the camp box are limited in the same way that the upper levels are.  
---
That means maybe some vaults were open at the same time the BoS and the responders were fighting the Scorched, maybe even before !
---
There is also a Vault dweller inside a fridge in Berkeley springs.
---
Yep, found this one !
---
If you're playing on PC you can get a mod that does this.  It's easy to install.  All you do is open up the zip file and move the .ba2 file to the data folder in the Fallout76 folder and move the .ini file to the Fallout76 folder.

It's not the biggest deal really, but it'd be nice to have presets.

crevasse has the added bonus of regularly spawning a legendary on the roof and the nearby trailer (truck) usually has either missiles, a power armor frame with raider pieces or a missile launcher, or all three \^\^

I'm just here waiting for private servers.
---
So go back on fallout4
---
From what I've heard the guide is full of misinformation, quests are different to what's actually in-game, etc.
---
Not sure if it's true, but it's enough for me to take anything about "Upcoming Content" with a pinch of salt.
---
Even if it came straight from the Devs.
---
You can get them as reward at any level for doing the prison patrol quest/event. You can get other weapon plans for it too, so it might take some runs. Got them for my 50-something char 3 days ago at first try and another char around 40 some weeks back, but thats luck I guess.

Grahm-centric expansion when?
---
Its not popular to reveal the truth. And the truth is you guys appear irritated over the fact that bethesda isnt building their game with the sole purpose of fulfilling the needs of greedy, in-game item hoarding users, whoever they may be.

Those are the ones that add the carry weight correct? I have difficulty remembering their names lol

Only the people who don't look up stuff themselves.

Yep I posted a thread on that very subject last night. It sucks having your help refused.
---
It happened to my friend when he tried it, the game has kind of a charming / infuriating enemy spawn where you can‚Äôt be sure... for me it goes the wrong direction. I want level 68 super mutants now and for some reason I only get 23-48 spawns most places. 
---
It adds some danger to a world that theoretically invites you to head to any part of it even before progressing in levels. Warmest Welcome!
---
If you get cold just drop some bombs to feel the warmth fuzzy RAD
---
Fuck I just got all the way down 
---
Mate, is anyone really still using ‚Äúthots‚Äù unironically these days? 
---
I find it ironic that you accuse me of being a serious role player, when you seem to think re-producing in a virtual nuclear wasteland is a neat idea.
---
I'm genuinely creeped.
---
I applaud you.
---
This is one fundamental thing I've wanted since the beginning.  The biggest problem I have with FO76 is that everything you do has zero persistence in the world.  You don't affect it.  Since there's no NPCs, FO76 doesn't have the means for character change.  Unlike FO4 where a player can reshape many areas and resettle the wasteland, FO76 lacks that effect too.  And unlike previous FO games, modding is vastly limited so there is far less a player can do to tailor the game to their liking.  FO76 lacks a lot of elements from previous games and effectively feels like much less of a game.  Online play is nice.  The world is pretty.  I do think there is even more content developed into the space.  However, it also hacked away numerous chunks of the game.  The one thing FO76 needed to be was different.  It sort of needed to be FO Minecraft, in a sense.  It needed to unleash players upon to the world and then leave then to their own devices.  It could very easily be a people vs the harsh wasteland game.  Since there's no NPCs, there also needs to be mechanics to support players ability to act as NPCs, take on jobs, set up shop, be hired mercs, create custom jobs/events to hire others for, etc.  FO76 is an online game that really needs a strong world building and social element.  Unfortunately FO76 was created without nearly that grand of a vision.
---
Yeah I think that's likely. If I remember correctly from the terminal outside Vault 94 was opened.
---
That actually makes sense,lol!
---
1- they already said they cant make camps indestructible because then you can do things like lock people into them or use them to block certain areas etc
---
2-this is not a single player game. If you want that, then play fo4, it looks the same but has way more pve things to do
---
Nah it‚Äôs not stupid, it‚Äôs one of the main reasons I stopped. Same reason when No Man‚Äôs Sky came out (regardless of the other problems I still liked it). 
---
Both games were just an endless storage management simulator. A pointless limitation on games built around hoarding. 
---
When the harvest of news is so bountiful, it‚Äôs bound to happen.
---
Rifling is done through broaching, and an index unit. You can do it on a bench press, screw machine, drill press, mill or even a lathe. You wouldn't do it with a boring bar... unless you are highly improvising. I guess you could down gear the worm gear, use a steady rest, and take light cuts over many passes. 
---
For the barrel, I wouldn't worry about the OD at all, only enough wall thickness. The outside can be square, round, or even hex. The latter was somewhat popular for barrels for a short bit. Best bet would be drill it undersized, ream it to size, then lap the bore on the beach end to open it up several thousandths and form a taper in the first few inches. If you are interested, there are some gunsmithing videos . Pretty interesting how it can be done with some minimal tooling. 
---
     
---
Still, I am slightly disappointed in their workbench. 
---
Treat bulked items as ressources like caps. database and stash limit problem solved.
---
&gt;Our community really needs to take a hard look at itself and decide if it wants $60 spent 3 months ago justified, or if they‚Äôd like to have this game be a major priority for Bethesda.
---
Cool, done. I'll take that first one and let 76 run its natural course, however long or short that may be. Maybe BGS will learn some useful lessons.
---
Yes I think I have six left.. Gt themisterphenix Message me
---
There‚Äôs quite a few things that got datamined that still haven‚Äôt surfaced in the atom store as yet.
---
Curious, considering everybody and their dog is saying how they have atoms they‚Äôd like to spend.
---
What's the channel called?
---
So incredibly frustrating, sorry but feels better to know you suffer too, thanks 
---
Not to be a dick, but you should have checked before going through all the effort. 
---
I know this is over a month old but for anyone else looking the trapper armour plans are a 100% guaranteed drop from a broken or burning tent encounter. This encounter can happen in multiple locations across the map. I currently know of 3.
---
The encounter is however very random. 
---
The locations I know of are:
---
The road below Hunters Ridge on the West side of the map.
---
The land to the side of the road on the opposite side of the river from Charleston Station.
---
The crossroads South of Harpers Ferry in the Mire.
---
actual interaction at GameStop:
---
me (sarcastic): yeah, $60 hardcover strategy guide for an online only game, great investment.
---
employee (shrugging): well, someone might want a reference for all the damage values and stuff like that.
---
me: but that's all the damage values *at launch*.
---
employee (disturbed realization sinking in): that's actually a good point.
---
"they"  
---
You realize even though it's the 'official' guide it's not made by anyone at Bethesda, right? It was quite possibly written by Dave Hodges, who did the Fallout 3 and 4 guides for Prima. He makes the guides by playing the games and discovering everything like any other player would, except he's given access to the games months in advance.  
---
https://mashable.com/2017/03/17/strategy-guide-how-its-made/#67cOXRGyoOqr
---
Eh this kid was more likely in the 14-17 range by his voicw but... sure 
---
Also I too have the 2700x only work around I‚Äôve found to make the game at least playable... still pauses sometimes for many seconds but, if you launch FO76 the alt tab and set the affinity to cores 234567 it will at least not lock up.
---
Wares.
---
Its a small town located near China.
---
Ohhh shi...
---
Yea I know
---
100% this will not make it to the front page of any other sub that this was mentioned on. the original story will continue to be touted as another reason Bethesda is screwing up.
---
While you are at it, make the PC controls more consistent in the UI
---
Could I get 2 shocks and 2 jetpacks?  I have 2,500 caps, but I also have junk, I am pretty sure I have close to 100, or maybe more, ballistic fiber.
---
The only type of lag I enjoy is when I headshot one and it pops like a balloon _and then_ he says ‚ÄúOw! My head!‚Äù

Six! Dang lucky rng!
---
The "news" about the trade stealing bug is that it was fixed in the first patch.  If it ever existed.
---
Other multiplayer games have sold poorly but don't go free to play.
---
Message me gt themisterphenix 
---
This is the game doing its thing. A high level player must have zoomed through the area, priming the mob spawns to his level. You then tumbled on that angry crew on pure bad luck.
---
Happens. The wastelands are a chaotic place.
---
Sent you a message! How much for jut the jet pack? Or is the combo 2 shocks and the jet?
---
Actually it wasn't eckart who had the idea... One of the enclave scientists reasearch led to this conclusion.
---
You mean the one already sold in the atom store?
---
I'd prefer to build anywhere and everywhere.  Then just have players able to destroy anything too (as well as enemy mobs).  I'd enjoy something less than "this is my stuff." There's enough resources to just build unto the world and then let the world sort it out.  Also part of the joy of nukes would be to level or cities or now specifically remove any unwanted monstrosities.  Players should keep the blueprint idea for easy save and rebuilding of things they're worked hard on.  
---
It might seem like TheQuartering uses clickbait titles... if you're a simple minded youtube viewer. It's going to be hilarious to see your reaction when this game goes F2P. Because it isn't going to last as full price forever. Your obviously biased view of the game is the reason why people aren't going to play the game in the future and the reason why it wont ever get better. You're a cuck.
---
Hope they won't because it's a very bad idea.
---
Me and a friend are on disability. We Farm PA mods and plans I sell them we split the caps..it takes a few days and week server hoping to get the stock up.
---
Then we sell when we are low on caps.
---
If you're asking about the game price plenty of people posted orgasmically about the price drop from certain retailers here on this subreddit. 
---
Jet Pack is 1000 Caps 
---
Apologies, yes I have not used Reddit much and I mis-read the heading as well as mis-interpreted the phrase "free to play".
---
I'll keep everything displayed, seems right.
---
I‚Äôll take all three
---
No offense, but why do so many of you feel the need to announce that you're leaving to complete strangers? What do you think this accomplishes?
---
Okay..
---
More people buy atom store stuff? I don't understand the stigma around f2p when the most financial successful game right now is f2p. 
---
I'd risk to state that it's not their *forte*
---
I have been playing it more recently and really have been enjoying myself a lot. Its not a bad game and i find myself often getting lost in the game world and i check out the environment...which is beautiful yes there are bugs but i have yet to play a game that doesn't have one and i did find a couple yesterday that i need to report one of which is a rendering bug at the Tyler county fairgrounds
---
Cool. Best of luck in your hunt. I will keep you two in mind when I am ready for them. 
---
No problem man...just a lot of grinding and server hoping and luck...
---
Magic acid land is not as good as farming yao guais (minimum 5 acid and 5 spring per head), but to be honest that's the fault of those animals loottable being insanely good. 
---
I just thought I would share my experience with the game and see if others feel the same way. Perhaps you don't understand that.
---
Adrenalin perk in agility which increases your dmg after kills and adrenal reaction mutation which increases weapon dmg at low health
---
No murder, only trade!
---
People who can't manage their stash room just keep too much useless stuff. CHANGE MY MIND
---
I mean, you could just go read the multiple other threads posted every day if that was the case. Honestly this game makes everyone so damn dramatic. 
---
Got any meat??
---
Ohhh, well that is way too low level for endgame content. 50+ would be a safer bet unless you are looking for an extreme challenge.
---
Why would it be weird? I'll use (the translation of) daddy and mommy to call my parents until they/I die. No reason to stop at a particular age. A trick to get their attention faster is also to alternate and call them by their real name every other time :-) 
---
If you did the mayor for the day quest you would know he isnt on the whitelist. So hes most likely gonna stay like this. 
---
Not even. 
---
Boss: You need to work harder your vacuum sales are down
---
Me: But my power armour sales are trough the roof.
---
Boss: WTF is a Power armour and we only sell vacuums.
---
yeah it‚Äôs a pain. i went through it alone when i was level 36. i ran through most of it, and then couldn‚Äôt finish launch prep. :( it‚Äôs better to do it with people or at least when ur level 50 with a good weapon. 
---
This is why people shouldn't take what other people say, so seriously, without proof.
---
And also, 3 months ago, this guy suggested [they added bowsette](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9j0q6d/suggestion_add_bowsette_to_runescape/) to runescape, so I would take his suggestions with a grain of salt. 
---
Wholesum dad, you would be a great Overseer.
---
There's the perk that makes Rad-Away remove more radiation, but that's all I can think of.
---
The game has already lost a majority of its players. I never said it was going to die without me lol. The game is unplayable for me.
---
Damn, spent like an hour searching for him last night, my only hope of finding the Handmade Rifle Plans since I don't feel like creating a new char, anyone knows how much does it cost on the market?
---
Wait, you totally changed the context of the post. 
---
This originally was about some female friend streamer you were white knighting getting hammered on stream constantly and now you've changed the context to you?
---
What gives? What happened to the stuff about ruining her stream?
---
The carpets actually do match the drapes now, which takes my comment totally out of context.
---
You don't. I launched mine first at around level 35. I launched one solo at at 55. I launch them every time I'm online just for gits and shiggles because I want the lead in the weight rooms and the steel and lead scrap the robots drop. Then I launch the nukes just cos.
---
Currebtly level 97 ish and out of nuclear keycarda. 
---
They can deny. But it will happen. The game is basically free already at retailers.
---
It is what it is, just have to get over it and move on when someone ganks you.
---
Thanks for the advice, i don't often farm whitesprings outside of nuke zone so i'll give it a try.
---
Cool. I haven't seen that. 
---
I found him in Grafton, on the bridge 
---
That's ridiculous. Especially considering that they literally encouraged you to go to any drop in your general area by automatically adding it as a quest.
---
grap the power armor chassis, you can  cratf it at your camp if you have PA station. pick the 'power smith' card (intelligence)
---
The issue there is "why even bother"?
---
Just because a game allows you to kill each other does not necessarily make it a PVP game - there have to be more parts to it than that and FO76 does PVP so badly it almost doesn't qualify as a PVP game.
---
When there are far better PVP games out there, FO76 is the last place I'd go to play that and that's the hill Bethesda have to climb over.
---
The first stash increase was said to be not the last but the first one, hinting that there would be at least a 2nd one.  
---
I am a crazy hoarder and I would like to save lots of things, but ok, here its not possible. I have 3 chars each specialized in different weapons and ammo, so I can save like a 75% of stuff I want. Then a mule that carries all the ammo, plans, maps or legendaries I won't use, but can't drop because they are trade goods.  
---
So I am more or less managing, but still spending lots of time stashing stuff, choosing what to save, what to sell, what to send to my mule....and yeah, its not very enjoyable.  
---
So I won't ask for unlimited stash size, or a huge one like 2k lbs. But another increase of 200 lbs would be great for me, and would allow me to reduce the inventory micromanagement nightmare.  
---
But also a shared stash with about 50lbs, so I could easily send items to my other alts would be even more useful.  
---
Yes, I expect some of this to happen, another small stash increase, or a shared stash like some games have.  
---
From my understanding, they said they would make the 1st increase, and see how servers performed / how the increase impacted them, to see if they could do another increase.  
---
After that, the dupe, stash and carryweight exploits were rampant, so I believe they couldn't do what they said, as there were other problems impacting servers.
---
Maybe now with most of exploits fixed they can do it.
---
It happens sometimes if one part of your materials with you and the other one in your stash. Put it together 
---
If you wanted a look it's in the North-East of the map near the Red Rocket workshop. It's quite a idyllic little spot bit not much to see.
---
Says the troll with the troll comment which lacks any substance at all. Want to point out where I was wrong or is that beyond your limited brain to do?
---
What level are you? 
---
Well, I messaged you...
---
47.
---
Not to say you're not observant or have trouble reading. But *LAST* week, there was a weekly challenge to **pick 0/10** flowers,. When the OP made his post during the previous weekly challenges.  
---
This week, there's another challenge for **picking flowers, 0/8**. The challenge repeated two weeks in a row, on the amounts are different.
---
Nice, thanks.
---
&gt; a majority of its players
---
Prove it. 
---
\+600hrs, slowed down to 4-6 nuke runs a day b/c work but it's still  fun. My first op weapon  was an explosive shotgun at lvl70, after that things got more efficient. These are some of the drop that  were notable...
---
e: boltaction pipe, gatling laser, gatling... others
---
ts: 3xminiguns, 2x pipe pistols, fatman, 2xflamer, lmg+rof, 10mm pistol, handmade,  bpr, bpp, dragon, combat/sniper rifles, and a bunch of others.
---
tse: handmade+perception, pipe bolt action, .44, radium rifle.
---
Rng plays a huge factor of how the dice land, but getting efficient at rolling the dice improves the potential of a good drop.  The queen has graced me with three serum plans, egghead, herbivore, and empath. I honestly lost track of how many nuke runs we've done and have started keeping the mainframe cores as a counter.  
---
Funny story on this evening's last queen run, we've been asked to avoid killing the queen too fast, since not everyone can get down there in time to tag her so I've been leaving her at \~10%(to the c' in scorch) and letting the groupies finish it off. We saw 5 +100, 180?, and a few 40-70's. Our group consisted of a lvl7, 80?, and 349. 
---
 I saw some of the others had explosive weapons so I fully expected them to kill her eventually, and told my group I'd jump in a fissure if they failed, with my 30 damaged mainframe cores, some scraps, and my hubris. [I lost.](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AgJfPUD6QVbhiwknQYDUXNuP5Wow)
---
The only time I saw him was in Whitesprings when I was level 23. I had a total of about 33 caps at the time and could purchase nothing. He came by just after a nuke zone had cleaned up, and watching all the players who were leaving sprinting back was hilarious.
---
The OP made his post about the *previous weekly challenges*. Which also had pick flowers. The challenge has repeated this week. The previous week it was 0/10 flowers. This week it's 0/8 flowers. 
---
Sorry. Reading for the win. 
---
Not sure there's a cure for the game freezing. I think it happens to everyone when stuff is loading in.
---
I didn‚Äôt get a message from u on Xbox Gt themisterphenix 
---
Yes that‚Äôs exactly right. It‚Äôs set up for the ‚ÄúHome Brew‚Äù event which is still in the files but was cut from the game.
---
I have no solid evidence, but the discord for F76 used to be active and it's now dead. I had around 20 people to play F76 with, at first, and now I have no one to play with.
---
BGS, "Hold my beer."
---
Nah you can't do that.
---
Do you mind to make a Mothman one?
---
Man, I can bearly find them!
---
&gt; Honestly, I just genuinely like Grahm.
---
He just is one of the only three relatable unique NPC in the game, and the only organic one. So that's understandable.
---
Serious more people need to do this on PC! I'm going to run down to Camden to see if I can find a clown costume.
---
Feel better?
---
I need legendary chainsaw. I need it so damn much.
---
I don't think I had that when I was playing with that custom cfg lowering the shit out of the graphics back in the days before the GPU upgrade.
---
He‚Äôs pitying the miner digging his bones.
---
a) No. Can't store it on the power armour station
---
b) Your power armour is safe from theft so long as you don't drop (square on ps4) it. Place it (x) and it's safe.
---
Nah, thats a bug. I would say a Watoga tearthrough will net you 3-5 legendaries on average though.
---
Bolstering makes you basically invincible with all the parts attached.
---
But back to your question, without a doubt the unyielding is the winner not because of it's potential in fight, but in being versatile all-around. For example you lower your HP and your CHR skyrockets, so you get better prices at vendors, your INT skyrockets and you craft items with really good durability, your STR skyrockets so you can carry extra stuff that you didn't have place for etc... The versatility of that prefix is off the charts and that clearly makes it the best one
---
Pretty much yeh
---
Having enough problems already, we don't need anymore traffic on the servers
---
Are you sure about that? I have my house foundation on the river.
---
Lol no.
---
I think it depends on the location in the water. Sometimes it just doesn't let me put walls on,  sometimes it does. Seems to depend on the depth of the water and even if there's rapid nearby. 
---
i‚Äôm aware of the perk and only check if my damage has changed after not killing anything for a while, and i dont have the mutation :|
---
i have had all three on handmade rifles and bloodied is clearly the best the best in my experience 
---
Well, the Whitespring only hires white robots, if you can believe that!
---
And another one in raider cage where "Diehards" base was. "94" on it's back if I remember.
---
Just wait until you find a Mr. Veterenarian and you'll have a definite #3. So. Many. CATS!
---
i too hope you will see your son soon again
---
Nobody was worried thanks though
---
I did not hear what you offered me, or how much ballistic or silver you wanted.  There are a few people talking.
---
:-)
---
There are 5 spawning next to Watoga in the Flooded Trainyard (the mob type can vary but it's worth checking if you are in the area), 2 guaranteed west of Mountainside B&amp;B next to the wrecked train cars, 1 guaranteed on the parking lot north of Philippi Battlefield Cemetary. 
---
I couldn't repair my weapons without that list. Enjoy!
---
They don't know how to make a multiplayer game and refuse to learn from others. They think they are adding an element of danger when they are actually adding an element of annoyance and grief.
---
The one in the atom store is essentially the "clean" version of the blue uniformed nuke officer, yes, but it's totally different from the beret-wearing nuke officers who are wearing some bastardized version of an Army Special Forces class A uniform.  
---
People were though 
---
Right, that's what I'm looking forward to, it given me new purpose in the game
---
It's not. Just ignore it and go have a blast in Appalachia
---
Honestly unyielding has a lot of interesting bonuses if you understand what they can do for you at 20% hp
---
For strength obv more melee dmg and carry weight
---
Perception.... meh you spot enemies easier?
---
Charisma., allows you to share more stars in perks up to five as long as you stay at low health
---
Agility.... more action points supposedly better sneaking
---
Intelligence. Less words when you hack terminals Also try repairing your armor/weapons with an unyielding build it seems to actually increase your items CND
---
Luck.. supposedly better chances for three star legendaries off three star legendary monsters but weapons will drop with higher CND..
---
This isn't a,real,survival game at all. FONV has a "survival" type mode callee hardcore that is the same 
---
Cheers. Pity, it‚Äôd help a lot with the stash box issues.
---
Noice, thanks.
---
Can rifle a barrel, can't thread a screw... huh what?
---
Your post sounds like the unreleased lyrics for ‚ÄúBlue Suede Shoes.‚Äù
---
I don't really use any weight management cards. I probably could/should, but I usually have space to spare myself. 
---
Idk, with melee it's not one item or perk that puts it over the top. It's the right combination of many factors that seem to get the crazy out put. I don't think they can nerf it cause they would have to nerf the entire class
---
I liken him to Benjamin Buford from Forrest Gump. Bubba Gump shrimp..."Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. There's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it." Grahm is a great character. My son and I have many a chuckle at his monologue.
---
It's a harbor freight all in one, that's why we can't make anything decent with it.
---
Apparently we can't do both ...
---
This works, still get freezes but at least I can finish quests now 
---
Got somewhat of 9 legendaries there in a hour yesterday. Lvl 50 legendary robots is dead after 5 or 6 power attacks with hammer (12 strength, no melee damage perks). Easy HP and legendary farm, and you have BS vendor nearby to sell all crappy legendaries. Just run around the senter and they spawn realy quickly.
---
Just farmed enough mini-nukes to go on private property rampage. See you all in the evening!
---
Wait, you haven't played in two week as when you log in you see different people?
---
Hmm that could be, I've only setup my camp since early on in the Forest region on the river. Maybe I'll move at some point, but its nice not getting your camp destroyed by high level enemies.
---
Yeah I am trying to finish the golfer ghoul quest before I hit 20 but everything is lvl 60+ and even tho I manage to kill some of them, none seem to count for the quest
---
Most folks use discord for LFG on pc.
---
Game 
---
You: vault dwellers do not want vacuums, they want things they can use in game.  Honestly boss you really suck at in game market places.
---
Boss: you know what else sucks.....vacuums and you‚Äôre sales figures.
---
Playing a game at least 8 hours a day for 5 days a week... getting payed....
---
Any more hours could be OT....
---
Life goals.  . .
---
How has this gotten so much traction? Like seriously I hate it every time when I look on YT or google for som 76 info or a fun/creative clip it's always the same bashing. Of course every sheep clicked on this "OmG f2P LULZ xD" clip. I saw it the other day and just sighed. I regret not streaming more because there are just a few fun/good content creator for 76. Bless riflegaming and the few others that actually try to push out some decent content.
---
I dont know if it was irony from you but I dont think its a good thing that we lose diversity in the game
---
War.
---
War never changes.
---
If you could just hurry up and guess what you've done you could get a new dragon soul.
---
Still chews through its durability 
---
And that's why I've only bought 3 physical copies of games since the release of the One and that was only because they were dirt cheap used copies. Well, that reason, and game sharing with my wife.
---
Ive found lifesaving / mysterious saviour to be utterly worthless. They never proc because 99% of the time when I get "killed" I go straight into dead, never the "downed" state.     
---
At first I thought this might be to do with limb destruction, so I experimented with 3 perks in adamantium skeleton. Didnt make any difference.     
---
I guess RNGesus just hates my character. 
---
Yeah its super annoying.
---
100% always hear shit like o then people can lock them inside their camps bla bla bla.
---
Like no shit its why pvp and pve rules would differ. Pve side you would allow fast travel in camp zones regardless of nearby enemies.
---
Like this stuff is not hard when you consider rule sets. Like every other online game when it comes to pvp and pve servers.
---
I see zero reason as to why anyone could defend the notion of pvp and pve players must play together...
---
It just ends up been those who want to pvp and those who end up been griefed because they don't want to pvp.
---
Super annoying to try and deal with those who want pvp and pve to remain together.
---
They need to make sensation out of nothing and look for attention, otherwise clips won't have enough views. YT is not the TV - you choose what to see and what to ignore, so no one force you to see their crappy videos...
---
Pretty sure you can still only share cards at your normal CHA height. Im mutated af, but after switching some points into END I can no longer share rank 3 CHA cards
---
How does this even happen? I have killed many queens and it still always takes several minutes at least. I've never seen a queen die that fast except for a few videos of people showing off.
---
While we are on the topic of PC can we get more in depth Graphic settings and Control setting in the damn game. 
---
Yeah I have been stuck at 6 forever myself.
---
Highly doubt it's on an hourly basis. Hodges was working as a contract employee for Prima, so it could very well be a flat fee paid per guide, or maybe a fee + percentage of sales, something like that.  
---
Still probably pretty lucrative, though, as he cranks out those crazy hours 10 out of 12 months a year, and has something like 100 guides to his name.  
---
Or at least he did until Prima shut down last year.  
---
Food or Alcohol Buffs?
---
We won't loos diversity but rifleman builds will just have to double down and invest and fine tune there build. We will also probably  see more stealth and glass cannon builds come out of this. In the end it's only gonna hurt the person that just wanting to run around and one shot everything with no skill.
---
Yes it is it's just not as punishing as other games.  The game was designed closer to be like Conan exiles or ark.
---
If you look closer 76 functions more as they do rather than a single player game so it isn't smart to approach it as such.
---
Right yeah I bet at least it was salary but had to think of it from my hourly perspective... one day I'll be there tho... one day....
---
I‚Äôll take a closer look at this. There is certain equipment, such as All Rise, thT has +10 HP. Need to see if food raises it for endurance or not. I‚Äôm going 15 endurance on my RP transporter / tank. 
---
It happened to me this week-end. By the time I was in the nuked area circle, the queen was already dead. Crazy.
---
I'm certain it comes down to if you are bitchslapped or shot down, and the former makes you dead instantly
---
Too much to mention I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs worth trying to reach you at this point.
---
Game breaking glitches, missions not even playable, loot bags disappearing, constant crashes and disconnects, long as hell load screens, game balancing in general is way off. 
---
No endgame whatsoever, atomic shop prices way overpriced and of course the controversies surrounding the game which further highlights the lack of care shown to this game. 
---
If you‚Äôre still oblivious to these facts, which are indisputably fact, you can‚Äôt deny these things.. then nothing will get through to you.
---
Only thing I find myself looking for now is plastic. Pretty much the most useless thing in other Fallouts had become my consuming need.
---
Both times I've met him was over near Sunshine Meadows.  I fast traveled to the power station near there both times as well; once he was walking past the workshop, the other time he was standing next to Hillfolk Hotdogs.  Maybe you and the other folks will have more luck there?
---
comparing Trove to FO76 :/
---
Any game can be doing better than another, it doesn't mean its doing well or acceptable. It could just mean one has 100 crashes per hour and the other has 50.
---
Trove though....how can you compare a voxel based f2p to a AAA fallout title?
---
Somebody below actually caused me of duping lol
---
See this annoys me more than anything else. We are suppose to be there to help one another. The lore is we grew up together and now set out to reclaim the wastelands together.
---
No where does it state we are a vault of serial killers.... 
---
Would atleast be nice to have the option of co-op onlu servers.
---
u/Ladydevann  would you not agree?.
---
I believe their scummiest competitor might be to blame.  EA.  Their practices are some of the most disgusting out there.  And if you remember the fires they tried to put out regarding Mass Effect 3, it was crazy.  Day one DLC, inability to get the very 'best' ending without playing their loot crate riddled Multiplayer.
---
Sorry, Bethesda may have bugs, but they're not malicious.  They're the company that has done what modders always dream of doing, cramming a single player engine into multiplayer.  Sure it might not work perfectly and be buggy, but at least they're trying to make something based on 'heywouldn't this be cool?' Rather than just churning out another generic team vs team shooter.
---
I believe FO76 is a threat to EA, because once one company tries to make single player gameplay multiplayer, suddenly the expectation goes up.  Look at EA's 'open world star wars' game they were going to bring out.  Originally was going to be this big open world non-tick based shooter and melee mmo, basically a star wars version of fo76, but after 2 years they pulled the plug on it, firing the team and changing it so it's now projected to be just another battlefront.
---
They're polar oppositesto Bethesda in their intent, that's why I have time for Bethesda.  EA though?   They're the sort of scum who would hire people to sabotage AND would benefit most from doing so.
---
I have a lot of time in this game.... what is all this about the blackberries now?
---
I really wanted to roleplay power armored raider initialy, but the game lacks both power armor specialization for Raider PA and CAMP decor. I have yet to see a person above 25lvl to wear Raider PA.
---
Raider PA should give something:
---
Excavator armor - bonus to mining and extra carry weight
---
T45/T51 - good DR/ER/RR and Jetpack mod available
---
x-01 - better RR and jetpack
---
ultracite - maximized DR but lacks jetpack
---
Metal armor in the game gives best non-PA DR when maxed, probably Raiders' PA could be be like that: maximized DR on par to ultracite, but very low ER and RR (there are so many holes)?
---
Extra points if we could mod it to reduce Junk weight. It will leave it unviable for blast zones, but might find sweet spot outside of it.
---
Does your wife also spam sonic screech like she is bugged when you come too close to her crack?
---
Haven't played the game yet, been on holidays travelling since before the release, so if my comment is ignorant I apologise. I'm assuming storage is accessed through C.A.M.P. workshops similar to FO4 too.
---
An idea, given each C.A.M.P. has an initial stash capacity already in place, implement a system of gradual increases through storage construction:
---
- to increase player stash requires the building of containers, e.g. chests, drawers, etc
---
- each container has its own capacity, which adds to the C.A.M.P. overall stash size by a small amount. 
---
Only those who really want huge amounts of extra storage will build their C.A.M.P. entirely out of buffets and credenzas. Like a second hand furniture store...
---
Of course there would be issues with this idea, i.e. there would still need to be a hard limit on stash capacity due to stability. And I have no idea about the background coding required to implement. But it's an idea.
---
I don't even know how people dupe! This is a week of picking up and keeping all the salt I found. Took up about 30lbs of stash!! Glad to be getting that back.
---
If it isn't in the next patch I'll literally eat the cardboard disk I got instead of a cd, what a day, then return said disk to them.
---
i have my CAMP next to Pleasant Valley Station by the junk resource, he often comes by there 
---
in my special I have 3 CHA points. But under my status screen my CHA is listed as +17. I can share out level 5 perks no problem. 
---
Oh oh look at my camp please :)
---
Her sonic screech spam has a variety of reasons for being used none of which have to do with my behavior, that was the first truth to learn. There‚Äôs no magic way to avoid the aggro :] 
---
There‚Äôs the part that‚Äôs missing.  You have to place a power armor chassis and build on it.
---
Me: your wife to before she picks you up at work.
---
Please hit up vautboys wv, dm me if you have twitter and I‚Äôll promo you! They play on ps4 and are always looking to feature cool players on the podcast. 
---
By being a cheaty duper pants wit 10,000 bobble heads.
---
that better be for a matching pair :P
---
you can also craft it at any station. go for perk card .
---
I saw him about 5 times when I had my camp just outside the Gorge Junk Yard, directly east of vault 76. He was on the railway, also saw him a few times north of Flatwoods on the main road.
---
Yes, 2,5k for 2 cal shocks
---
I have an extra you can have, add obtuseOBTUSE and look for me on weekdays generally mid day and early
---
Evening. 
---
Naw, the only "effect" I had other than mutations was +20 carry weight from food. I'm pretty sure something is just wrong with it cause it happened to a shotgun right after the post to. But the gun was a first, the melee thing was happening all the time this past weekend.
---
yawn. boring. 
---
Great games instigate this and draw the kind of players who enjoy RP custom interaction. I‚Äôm super happy to be part of this player group, it‚Äôs a privilege. Abundant Gratitude 
---
why would you think anyone gives a single solitary shit about you tho 
---
Odd... I play 3-4 nights a week 2-3 hours at a sitting. So far this month I've had 1 crash 0 server disconnects and 2-3 moments of server lag. Not sure why you are having so many issues. 
---
Pretty much have to drop the % modifiers from all perks and gear
---
Updated my post above to help your points. To stop any bullshit about it can't be done.
---
so stop.talking rubbish. piss off or prove it. 
---
Melee deaths are always insta death? I guess that would confirm what Ive been seeing. 
---
Yes! Stop having fun with this game right now! 
---
I might just hold you to that Force. :P
---
I always wondered if the +20 Carry Weight from Grilled Radstag had a hidden strength buff for melee.  Need to experiment tonight.
---
Is the game still bugged so you get higher defense if you enter pa naked? It was like that a few weeks ago, not sure if it is fixed yet.
---
GIVE ME THE LINK RIGHT FUCKING MEOW
---
Well you take the strong back perk for example it grants +10 carry weight for each rank of the card. The max card is 4*. They could have implemented this as a passive perk starting at level 10 and granting the perk 1 point per 10 levels until you hit the maximum of +40 carry weight. Lockpick and hack could have been implement as 
---
Lockpick level 1 &gt; level 10 level 1
---
Hacker level 1 &gt; level 15
---
Now dont get me wrong I love the game. I love how there is no level cap and how eventually you can have all of the perks. While the perk system isn't all bad I feel it could still use some improvements. 
---
**One Suggestion**
---
I am not a fan of having to respec one perk point per level so I believe every 5 or 10 levels you should have the option to choose a new perk or respec your specials entirely.
---
Not to be nitpicking, but:
---
&gt;(I am european and new challenges starts near mignight
---
I am in the CET zone, and new challenges start at 4pm. Where in Europe are you, exactly?
---
That would also destroy every bloodied build, glass cannon as well. To nerf it would truly break the game for everyone, not just select people running one type of weaponq
---
Oh, so that's where the pee goes...
---
Then it seems to be bugged, in this case I would advise another player - best if it‚Äôs a female friend of the scorch beast queen 
---
They can tank the sonic screech for you and you can keep listening to the epic music 
---
Im a Youtuber :( I just do live streams. No news, no game bashing, just play.
---
As someone who paid $80 for this game, it wont bother me if 76 becomes free to play. I have put 314 hours into this game so far with no end in sight. So I feel like I more than got my monies worth. If this game becomes free to buy, Im OK with that as it will hopefully cause in a major influx in players. Players who were hesistant to get the game based on how much hate this game has gotten on Youtube, Reddit and other mediums. But now, those players can 'buy' the game at no cost to them. If they hate the game, no loss to them. If they like, then hell yea. Maybe they like the game so much they want to support in the future and buy into the Atom Shop, who knows.
---
All I know, the game is fun as hell, even with all its flaws, and I wont stop playing this game for the foreseeable future. I may put it aside from time to time as I still need to finish AC Odssey, Red Dead 2 and Just Cause 4 while also awaiting Anthem, Far Cry New Dawn, Days Gone, Division 2, Metro Exodus and some others in the future, but I will keep playing 76.
---
This game is too good to put down, even when someone like me who has pretty much completed everything technically 'doesnt have anything left to do' will find stuff to do...or relentlessly bomb the Queen because that fight is so much fun.
---
I love it, my friends I play with love it. Im playing it regardless.
---
National Isolated Radio Array and West Tek spawn a lot of super mutans that give good XP, and i often find 3-star legendaries 
---
yes
---
Haha you should play Tarkov üòÇ
---
The people here who do enjoy the game often don't experience these issues or it doesn't deflate their fun but they frequently post to have Bethesda take note of these issues to have them fixed.
---
The same people don't go around telling others which game they are allowed to play based on a youtuber recommendation. 
---
As a kid, watching my dad play games was so fun. Hope I can provide that for my kid.
---
Idk if there'll be a Kiss Psycho Circus sequel though.
---
All true... all covered on youtube the first week the game came out, they've beaten that dead horse into dust. Now they are just fabricating controversy to keep that hate train chugging in the name of view count.
---
I think it's more like 500 atoms per week: 7 times 55 (some days it's 50, some days it's 60 atoms) plus around 150 for the weeklies.
---
What's even worse is that the golfer ghouls seem to only appear in a certain level range. I've been doing this quest forever now on my lvl 50+ main and have 3/10. Yesterday, I managed to finish this quest on my lvl 20 alt. I was playing with a friend on his lvl 5 char because it's near impossible to survive the ghoul onslaught on your own if you're low level. We specifically went there when there were no high level players around so the ghouls wouldn't scale to them. 
---
I agree on the one shotting. But that is the real flaw that needs adaption. How come 90% of the game is super low key and the rest is so OP that you need to use a TSE to be effective if you are not a melee?
---
And no. I will quote myself from another post: 
---
I shouldn't have to spend countless hours to respec my stuff and to play a build type I don't really want to play just because of a new patch. That is terrible design.
---
In other words the TSE trashing wont resolve the problems. It will make them worse. Also it will frustrate players having spent hundreds of hours to aquire this endgame gear. Remove that and the motivation to achieve the good gear is gone as well.
---
Careful, your words don't fit their point of view so obviously you're a paid shill.
---
Wow...I found him way down south. He really gets around.
---
Humans...so small...so weak!
---
He gets all their legendaries. The crappy ones, at least.
---
Im paid?....Where is this money, I would like it if thats the case.
---
Does this really happen often? I literally never have seen this and I kill the queen almost daily if not multiple times. 
---
Did you find the living dog still hanging out with his dead masters?
---
Who pays for guides when the same information is free with a simple google search?  Fools and their money.....
---
This is exactly it
---
Yeah I was thinking bout it, I don't think it does. I just been using food items just for today, usually I use cannibal so I wasn't getting any effects before though.
---
This
---
PVE only servers. We need this option.
---
In terms of damage : prolly
---
In terms of HP : the 3 star has way more
---
No you cannot earn that amount per week from dailies and weeklies
---
No Bethesda should fix the game and make it playable 100% of the time for its current customers BEFORE trying to entice more in.
---
All going F2P will do now is add extra stress to servers and game code that can not handle its current load.
---
Going F2P would be about greed, trying to get more exposure for an over priced Atom store.
---
Bethesda looking at the bottom line and worrying about the money they didn't or wont get it, is whats going to destroy the Fallout franchise. 
---
Customer service and turning this beta / alpha into a quality product is what would save it. They went back to the drawing board with ESO after a dismal launch so it can be done, its down to Bethesda now and how much p\[ride they have in there product and work. I guess time will show the truth, as it stands now it looks like a rushed out cash grab :(
---
Lame
---
You didn‚Äôt even mention Wikis for games 
---
which can also update regularly and are free 
---
For two of the last four times I've done the Awol Armaments event the 3* gutsy at the end has dropped no legendary items and no other weapon. That doesn't inspire confidence in the current loot system.
---
Yeah, I'd like the stash size to be increased but honestly, I'd rather BGS fix the actual broken parts of the game first. 
---
For some reason I read that last sentence in MODUS‚Äôs voice.
---
Say what you want about duping tse but every obe wanted to nike whitesprings alot
---
That, and the big wigs probably think that they can have PVP substitute for late game content. It wont work; it never works. PVE games that push players toward PVP end game just die.
---
I think it's meant as a joke.
---
Brotherhood of Ultracite Explosive Vents
---
strange thing about it is that my melee and shotgun would drop below their normal damage and then return to normal later. My other weapons haven't done this as well.
---
Some day, moo-moo. I 
---
What
---
Glass cannon build is just as OP as many melle builds. But that's the thing the bloodied combat mechanism rackets up your damage to ridiculous  heights but in the end you have live 50-70 health. There is a crazy trade off.
---
Even with melee, you have to be right on top of the person to land a hit.
---
We see it so low key because we don't have melee oneshotting entire mobs at white springs or taking out players with slap damage...
---
I kinda agree with everything but:
---
 "Workshops now only offer half their rewards and remain the only zones that pvp is engaged. Outside of the area normal rules apply."
---
PVE Only servers should be devoid of pvp in all forms. It's kinda in the name "pve only". You've already suggested halving the gains from the work shops, that seems plenty. More so due to them rarely getting used outside of the munitions factory and sometimes the food factory.
---
one hell of a joke, bethesda better allow me to slap todd in the face. 
---
I could care less, there's plenty other challenges to complete.
---
yes i know, but it‚Äôs just fucking hilarious how ridiculous it is if you think about it 
---
Very easy to add in pay to win items in a FTP.
---
OwO
---
common bug - enemies aren't spawn, despite quest marker that levitate in the air. I didn't find the way to fix it other than changing server...
---
Oh, sweet band
---
Yeah just not really sure they could make them pve sided. Without losing them all together to an event type setup.
---
Not everyone has the time in their lives to do every single daily.   Also we should be pegging atoms to dollars as thats what Bethesda sells them for jackass.
---
Thank you...
---
Screw the uniform, I want one of those beep beep backpacks they are wearing. Actually I want all kinds of backbacks! Where are the backpacks?!
---
On a different note, I was overjoyed when I looted a Liberator Robot that dropped a yellow Star Pin only to found out its not a rare cosmetic...super disappointed
---
Hunger, thirst, degradation, repair costs and perks all need a major overhaul. 
---
Bethesda should give out mod tools and private servers. That way, modders who actually know how can once more fix their game.
---
I've shelved it for now. Degradation and hunger rates are just obnoxiously unfun mood wreckers. Until these get a second look, I'm done.
---
You‚Äôre not really addressing anything in particular. What controversy? And who‚Äôs they? Give me one person sewing supposed controversy.
---
Once again, though, its perk cards as bandaid for terrible design...
---
Yeah, I had a dude follow me around for like 30 Minutes. He would shoot me and then try to jump in front of enemies so that I would shoot him. Mind you, he was level 60 and I was level 8 on my second character. I was trying to roleplay to some degree where I only use leather armor and pipe guns unless I find legendary armor or guns. I didn't mention my roleplaying but I messaged him, asking if he'd leave me alone. He tried to use the excuse that he was trying to trade with me and when I obviously saw through the trolling he berated my gear by saying he was trying to give me better stuff than leather and pipe guns.
---
WHAT?!?!
---
Doesnt look like it yet. Which is surprising since they're all solved by now...But Alpha and Charlie are solved.
---
it‚Äôs all rng, and bethesda didn‚Äôt mention anything saying they fucked with legendary drops. just a run of bad luck for u i suppose 
---
Haha yeah, that would be quite terrifying 
---
A loop i do in the bog:
---
Start at watoga, check out the spawns there.
---
Head north to the substation, both the deathclaw and the insects can be legendary but not always.
---
Head east to the lake with the mirelurk queen, ive seen the spawn in the halfround building be legendary quite often, the spawns around the lake rarely.
---
Head north east to the work shop and check the spawns there.
---
Head north to the restaurant/robot place. Generally theres at least 1 legendary super mutant in the restaurant. Awol armaments event is also a guaranteed 3 star spawn at the end
---
If i still have space then its north to harpers ferry.
---
The Quartering, Yongyea, juicehead.
---
When do you all think there will be new content? The game is more than 3 months old, but so far there's been zero new content. What is a reasonable pace?
---
Yeah the fallout people I used to play with stopper playing it. My time playing the game has devolved to selling stuff to vendors and getting caps. 
---
What workshop?  Sometimes they get really far from the area but then sometimes they spawn in the ground.
---
Yet never a murdering great one
---
I see this going well.
---
To be fair I think it did initially say how before I realized my mistake and ninja edited it lol. 
---
Easy enough. Phoenix just has to go through Mayor for a Day, if only he could be arsed to.
---
I'm about to run it, but only looking for people who want to fairly contribute, not just "tag it for loot," sorry.
---
https://www.enclavedb.net/nuke-codes
---
i‚Äôm in this websites discord, and theyre on top of this shit. i recommend just popping into this instead of nukacrypt. sorry it‚Äôs not the code, but it should be solved in the morning. 
---
I don't have much, but I could help.
---
Could you please wait an hour?
---
How is it a bad idea?  Do you enjoy shuffling cards around to pick a lock?  You already learned the skill but need to drop out one rifleman card and load up three separate lockpick cards, pick the lock, then put all your cards back.  That makes sense to you?  
---
I'm not a huge fan of the BoS, but the field scribe outfit has a great backpack that could look just as good on a number of other outfits too! Actually, it would be cool if backpacks or pouches were added visually to armor with pocketed/deep pocketed mods, similar to how the skin changes with the paint/leather/combat armor tiers
---
I'll fight off the minions
---
That is true for the melee. But I can stand in a nuked whitespring and half a t51 PA right in the middle of the ghouls and one shot them all with my small character of level 51. Not bloodied but normal melee dmg with a one star legendary weapon and unfinished specs. Where is the skill in that? 
---
With the TSE you had at least to be careful with your aim. Shoot an enemy thats too close to yourself and you are done for. With melee I can just hack away barely looking what Im doing. And in the near future after the patch I bet you will see over 90% melee builds hacking away in springs or the sbq. 
---
Don‚Äôt know the quartering. Yongyea is irrelevant, doesn‚Äôt even play the game as far as I know, just hears stuff and repeats it on his channel. Juicehead is probably the most neutral one out there, doesn‚Äôt bash the game unnecessarily, makes positive videos about it. I don‚Äôt even believe he goes far enough specifically with the criticism and some comments even call him a FO76 shill. He‚Äôs alright in my book, I‚Äôve seen a lot worse.
---
I did not know this but I did an event at the Antique shop and found the Brotherhood fatigues there, something I've never seen or even knew existed. Pretty neat, though I've already crafted shielded BoS officer underarmor.
---
There is also a dead dweller in the church in the swamp, violently stuffed into a corner of a book case 
---
Yup...made my life so much simpler 
---
Well some foods and chems give strength and dmg bonuses but if its not them then its a mystery
---
Everytime i sit down to play it i just wander and it becomes to feel like a slog after an hour, it just doesnt even feel fun to fight anything
---
My biggest thought when it comes to workshops is to make them like events for the claim. Then cycle the invasions more often. Due to it being a pve server.
---
That would give content to both the person claiming it and people around the area. As they'd be able to fast travel in and defend it.
---
Claiming it from another player could also be similar to how it is claimed, it spawns an event. The person who owns the workshop will get a notification that a claim is being made on their shop. Though this time it would be similar to either capture the flag where in the two players have to race to an end objective or several. Once all objectives are claimed then the workshop goes to whoever won .. this could be repeated every 20 or so minutes.
---
Though if the player who owns the workshop does not accept the challenge or come to the event. Then it works like it does now and the player just claims it and waits till it's there within that green circle.
---
Or something along those lines.
---
Unfortunately that only helps identify 1 if you only have 2 chassis, one with and without Atom Shop paint. I use this to identify my X01 and Excavator in my player inventory, however my stash has like 3 chassis with different sets. It wouldn't be so bad if it organised the chassis in chronological order, but it's completely random which one you pick up and put down. 
---
I've got chameleon recently, but rifles in general are by far the lowest amount of drops I get. Seems to be like 70% armour, 20% melee and 10% guns, most of which are heavies or pistols.
---
Different play styles is what makes this game fun. If I want to run round in my undies with hammer smacked out on chems I can or if I‚Äôm feeling like an adult virgin I‚Äôll make a sniper build.
---
Watching that, I was wondering how long it would be before you nicked one of those nuclear Pintos with your shotgun.  :)
---
Hey mate, I don't want to help either. Could you drop me a set of X01 so I look good when I'm cowering in the barn? /s
---
Yes, because people were missing the point. I want a better passive mode. My friend was getting griefing..what‚Äôs hard to grasp about that?
---
Scorched lives matter!
---
Lmao @ asking me to rearrange my schedule to accommodate for a strap-hanger. As if it isn't bad enough you post a thread asking for a free ride, you do it without even being ready lmao. 
---
I went when I was like level 3 and just tagged the ghouls, ran to the robots, and let them reap me XP.  It's a beautiful thing.  
---
Beware when they do a dive attack - it‚Äôs alcoholic diarrhea 
---
I feel like my bowsette post can be seen as a meme. r/2007scape is a sub full of shit suggestions as jokes and I was trying to cash in on what was hot at the time. I don‚Äôt think that discredits my thoughts regarding fo76. 
---
Only been about 2 days since this topic has been posted, I guess we're due to discuss it for the 500th time. 
---
AWOL Armaments is the same, 3 rounds with 5 lvl 52 gutsies
---
I use weight reducing armors and fist weapons
---
All my stuff weighs less on me than in PA. Become encumbered when that goes on to survive a nuke zone, lol
---
Also, I fists. One 3* perk card leaves packrat&amp;travelling pharmacy available
---
My understanding is that you are not losing 80% of the total but that instead of getting a 100% bonus from the second shot you are getting a 25% bonus so if your rifle does 200 base instead of getting 400 you would get 250. Not counting perks and other effects.  Am I misunderstanding?
---
&gt; Its ridiculously taxing to have to micromanage swapping cards constantly throughout a session of game play.
---
More so when you have a few "level ups" saved. No I don't want to open perk pack... no I don't want to change special.... I just want to unlock... a crap scorchbeast spawned....sigh, where is my stabilized...or there it is.... wait no I don't need hard bargain I need tenderized....oh more scorched?  Wait, hold on a sec, need to swap tank killer back.... wait what weapon am I using? 
---
Can I get a time out please?
---
According to many sources, you won't find them before Level 15 or after Level 44, and it's not Grahm that carries them. It's usually either the Watoga vendors (station/plaza) or Harper's Ferry. I got mine from Harper's at Level 36, quite a while back. 
---
Boss: have you met Susie yet?....she‚Äôs the head of HR, I think you all should talk.
---
Meaning what? 
---
Fine, but I hope you like jetpacks and calibrated shocks, because I'm going to force you to also take those for free!
---
BGS said timeframe for private servers was within 12 months of release. Here's hoping it's underpromise, overdeliver
---
Easy way to handle ws at low lvl is when there facing the building with the bus to your right.
---
   Look to your left there is a brick wall with a truck  there just get them to chase you there jump on that brick landing area.
---
     Then just take them out just be careful of the few that may get up there with you almost all of them will get stuck at the wall trying to get up to you. 
---
Giving each category in stash a limit would be far far better than just the "Here's a measly 600, have fun".
---
400 scrap, 200 apparel, 200 weapon 50 weight etc
---
Not even. It is rare they give 700 atoms. Sometimes it is less than 500. Now add in the fact some are 1 day only items. Good luck earning that.
---
How about you go play fallout 4 and not buy a game that has pvp and then cry about said pvp? 
---
Someone did that to me last night, so I hunted them down and extracted caps from them.  
---
Shit ain't free, dude.
---
I don't think unlimited stash is the right choice for this fallout. When i played fo4 i pocket everything up. Just spamming the X key. But now i have to think about what i actually want to pick up and it adds something to the game. It is like another part of the survival aspect of it.
---
I realized it but jumped too late :D not that it would have mattered lol 
---
haha I'd prefer a stealth boy but I suppose it will have to do. I'll tell you when I'm ready 
---
This tactic looks good on paper, but in reality often just results in 2 scorchbeast attacks. Best to run to the pub to drop aggro.
---
What a silly reply... you don't even know the lore to 76. My idea would benifit both sides so your welcome griefer...
---
Yeah this was when I was 24-ish I think; Im at 55 now and I just melee them through the window, then go in and mop up the rest. 
---
Thats true, my bad.
---
you need to carry 10 water + 10 food , 10 stimpack , ....
---
maximum carry weight required is around 250.
---
That could work my man upvoted for the idea.
---
I think this game was seen as a way to utilize the great building system they made for Fallout 4, have a Fallout co op experience that people have been asking for, and a way to have a recurrent stream of income from a games as a service model (which I don‚Äôt think is inherently nefarious). 
---
The more people playing the game means more people buying items in the atom shop which incentives the company to pour more resources into the game because it‚Äôs seen as worth the cost of development. 
---
Regarding network infrastructure I cannot answer. I have computer science and finance background but not much knowledge in server maintainence. I do believe that Bethesda (rightfully) planned for more people to be playing the game than currently are (due to the massive smear campaign against it) which makes me hope there is some level of scaleability in place if more people ever get on. 
---
When OP made the post the challenge was for 0/8. He made the post about 1,5h after weekly challenge reset.
---
is this salt water - its salt with water in it if thats what your asking - its so salty - hey its only 90% of a lethal dose of salt
---
Fight the power. 
---
Finish leveling up your special points first.  33 is too soon unless you have been given great equipment.
---
From the patch notes there is nothing written about the second shot: 
---
"With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage. The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%."
---
- Two Shot damage is reduced to 25% =&gt; You lose 75% damage bonus
---
- Explosion damage is reduced to 20%.=&gt; You lose 80% damage bonus
---
The explosion bonus is debatable but the TS bonus was balanced since it is not assured that the second shot really hits the target.
---
Apparently you‚Äôve never played fallout if you think all vault dwellers are good people 
---
However, you are forming a bad opinion of it after the beta phase. (Some would argue it's still there atm) but no ever since the stash update and the like 500 + changes since it's a fairly more enjoyable game.
---
Only real issue with it is content to take up
---
You are too low level for them. Period.
---
I think, especially considering the issues at launch, that this sub is pretty positive most of the time. Sure you get the whiners in the comments but the majority of it is good constructive criticism, people throwing out ideas to make the game better, and people posting about good experiences. I'll be damned if this game doesn't bring out the drama in some people to the extreme though lol. 
---
bulk that junk and sell it.
---
Fried meat, roasted meat, charred meat, skewered meat, squishy meat, crispy meat, fishy meat, stinky meat, rotten meat, icky meat, browned meat, seasoned meat, salty meat, slimy meat, sticky meat, sugary meat, meaty meat, chewy meat, gamey meat, fatty meat, frozen meat, burnt meat, spicy meat, chopped meat, stringy meat, red meat, wormy meat, mashed meat, peppered meat.
---
Never got excited when I heard the ice cream truck outside lol
---
The hate really isn't justified. It's a great game that's being ruined by Youtubers because it's an easy target and they want their revenue. Mind you, they were creating controversy and bashing it months before it came out.
---
There are 4-5 daily and same for weekly challenges. Daily can be 10-20 each. Weekly are 30-50. Theoreticaly you can get 950atoms in one week. 
---
I assume the rate it produces acid is comparable or worse than just scavanging acid.
---
If your gonna comment on all my posts just do it in one go....
---
I probably know the lore better than most inlcuding you. Again my idea solves issues and rewards pvp and pve players. You do understand the lore of Fallout 76 correct?....
---
Probably not...
---
This will be my last reply to you read the idea i posted. Your kind benifits from it while us that roleplay the lore of 76 can do so without your kind.

Chameleon is a rarer drop. As are guns with legendary prefixes.
---
I do get a TON of 1 handed melee weapons and wooden armor if that makes you feel better.
---
I've found ONE good gun {In over 300 hours} and thats my Furious automatic combat rifle.
---
rng, I've got \*\*\* combat rifle from Harpers Ferry's Supermutant - useless, but still...
---
so how many legendary wooden leg armors did you get?
---
When Caveira ends up in Post Nuklear West Virginia.
---
I know it's been beaten to death, but we need more content, or a shift in content. I'm level 110, and the only thing left for me to do is get my perfect set of weapons and armour.
---
It would totally revive the endgame for me if we could strip legendary modifiers from weapons and armor and apply them to others. Even make it a really high cost -- at least it would give attainable goals while grinding for legendaries.
---
"How you hurt me?!"
---
And that‚Äôs your opinion but the difference between our opinions is this is a pvp game and they aren‚Äôt going to change it because you are butthurt. IF YOU DONT WANT PVP, DONT BUY A PVP GAME 
---
im not sure what u all talking about, but the servers r pretty loaded, despite my friend list going inactive as well.
---
I am not complaining. My girlfriend and I played this weekend and the servers were so peaceful. We didn't run into any Griefers or die hards with only base destruction in mind. My gf was actually enjoying the game for a change so I was happy about that. I figure the majority of players who are dropping off are either dupers, TSE shotgunners or people running from the F2P rumor circulating the web. But as for me I am loving it! I was actually able to do some events this weekend that I  never see on the map cause it has already been farmed to extinction like uranium fever. 
---
The only person who tried causing trouble this weekend seemed to have changed his mind on pvp when he realized his single shot fat man was out gunned by my two shot fat man with +40% reload speed üòÇ Or maybe he ran out of mini nukes as to where I have been stockpiling them for a while. But with the recent decrease in server activity you can call me Ronald McDonald cause at this point I'm ba da bop bop bah lovin' it. 
---
Well if you want something without working on it, use real money . I am just tellin you all, that it is possible to get atoms by playing. 
---
It's definitely coming. It was part of the datamined lists.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wkrj9/datamined_atom_shop_all_items_pictured/
---
A lot of the items were on that list before they came to the stores.
---
I haven't been having too much trouble with weight. I only keep weapons and armor I absolutely know I'll use, and I sell any junk/aid once it's starts to pile up too much
---
Bethesdas hair styles are a joke. 
---
üëçüèΩ I just turned lvl 95 last night also a melee build myself started out as a sniper build and changed over after finding out no leg snipe r rifle. 
---
    So now they have added them in game thinking of making alt and give sniper another go. 
---
Been playing since launch and mostly play solo. Its a survival (lite) game and needs to be played as such. Play to your strengths and not to the other players. I rarely wear PA as am faster without it and my TSE Gauss deals silly damage (especially when sneaking! ) mid range, and my Rocket Sledge (ignores armor) when it gets up close and messy. Not that i look for a fight, but when it happens i'll fight it to my advantage. Take my work shop! I wont fight you for it, but i'll now watch you and steal anything it produces. 
---
Also when i do resource runs i wont scrap anything till am at a train station so i don't drop scrap, if am ambushed. I enjoy the solo aspect and the other players, be they saints, sinners or somewhere between. Makes this game interesting for me.  
---

that's why i said "one of the most greedy"
---
This is sadly true lol
---
While I sympathise with your plight, and it is lovely that you took so much time to write your post, my opinion is that you should adapt to the game you are playing, instead of wishing that it was, and complaining that it isn‚Äôt, games you have played previously.  In Fallout 4, I kept every legendary weapon and armor I found, I looted literally everything, and my base, at 3-4x maximum build size, at least, has 186 power armors in it.  What I did, was went into Fallout 76 with the knowledge that *it isn‚Äôt Fallout 4!*  The game was not built, not intended for you to loot and keep every item in the game that you see, so, quite frankly, don‚Äôt.  They *wanted* the player to be fairly limited, and survival oriented, so play within the limitation and embrace the survival aspect, instead of dwelling on it not being a previous game.  Should should never start playing a new game, with expectations of any or all hallmarks of the games that came before it.
---
If you have pacifist on you don‚Äôt have to worry about him jumping in front of enemies.  If he was bothering you for 30 minutes it‚Äôs your own fault for not server hopping.  Just log out and log back in, new world.
---
Simply tie active perks to SPECIAL scores and character level. Simple and balanced
---
Do you update these? Or make new posts?
---
&gt;There are 4-5 daily and same for weekly challenges. Daily can be 10-20 each. Weekly are 30-50. Theoreticaly you can get 950atoms in one week.
---
Idk, I have egouth to impulsive buy shit i dont like 2mins later. Without buying it with $. Dont know why people are crying all the time.
---
Man, I'd pay 1000 caps for a BOS combat armor helmet on computer. I've scrapped tons of helmets and other combat armor pieces but haven't learned that pattern yet
---
The 15+ lvl part is incorrect.  It is believed it is more like level 12 to 15 with 15 being the sweet spot.  I was too high and did the grind on Patrol Duty until I received the plan.
---
Rng has been WEIRD tmsince the last patch. Ive had shit luck with legebdary weapons, until yesterday when I got a furious gatling and bolstering cb armor from a single Uranium fever event 
---
I'll never understand how other peoples opinions affect peoples game play.
---
If you enjoy it. Play it. If you hate youtubers. Watch netflix. You have options and you're the one making the choice as to what you're watching and how it affects you.
---
Mate, learn to let go. 
---
If you *really* need to pick up everything, that's fine. Bulk the extra and sell it.
---
 I don't keep more than 100 of anything, materials (except springs and ballistic fiber) are so common you never run out. 
---
I don't use any weight management perks, and I'm never overencumbrered. My stash is at 450/600. I run lean, and I know that's not for everyone but you honestly don't need a tonne of every type of crafting materials, and a stash full of weapons and armor you'll never use. 
---
I wish I could... 200 caps per vendor limit is also one of the issues, because otherwise I'd be swimming in caps right now. Well, not actually swimming, because.. surprise.. they have a 25k MAX caps limit as well.
---
But that's actually a good point as well, since I'd rather sell that junk, than carry it with me all the time.
---
There are not 2 sides.  Only those that want to complain about the mechanics.
---
So Grahm implies he is looking for something.  Is this a hidden quest?
---
Mine is just opposite Sunnytop (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called, the station and ski resort), across the road. There‚Äôs a junk pile and a river (you can‚Äôt have both). There‚Äôs raider camps up and down the road as well as the ski resort for XP and mats and it‚Äôs kinda the opposite side of the map from vault 76, with reasonably cheap fast travel to watoga and Harper‚Äôs ferry vendors. 
---
I mean, the Quartering admitted he was wrong, and said he never said FO76 was going free to play, just that he was seeing evidence of it being a possibility that it might, agaon admitting he was incorrect when more news came out. I dont even know Yongyea, and I dont know what Juicehead you've watched, but through out this whole thing, even through the legitimate controversies 76 has had he has been positive and tried to even defend 76 of some of the controversial problems its had.
---
People used to play with stopped playing for a few days, IZ DE GEAM DYIN GUISE?
---
If somebody has zero caps and attacks your base, you should be able to attack them without slap damage as long as they remain on that particular server.
---
Yesterday I had a situation where a cashless guy was decimating my workshop. I killed him once and removed his wanted. He then proceeded to attack my camp and he did not get wanted on him. I could not shot a person who was actively attacking my base one meter from me. That was 100% bullshit and its unacceptable.
---
Twin lakes is a good spot, not far from the locations you stated.
---
Oh man I worried that you'd disappeared! Thanks you for these, they're beautiful and I'm going to treasure them forever üòÅ
---
Sounds like fallout new Vegas. Plenty of crashes. Some missions literally cant be done. Load screens hurt. Endgame? Nah. Glitches everywhere but look. That's a great game 
---
I eventually did hop servers. However, I don't like engaging in PVP because I work fulltime and go to school part time so I don't want to waste much time. Load times from server hopping increase this wasted time along with the random crashes that already exist. I honestly forgot about pacifist though. Thanks for the reminder.

If your going to comment every post just do it in one go.  You obviously don‚Äôt know the lore that well.  The game was designed so that your other vault dwellers are both your friends and enemies in the wasteland.  In your magical lore understanding there would never be pvp or raiders.  Go play the sims.
---
All these theories are nice, but *I* reckon they had a little time towards the end of the fallout 4 dlc cycle and were kicking around the idea of adding some kind of multiplayer. The further they got into it, the more they realized it really needed to be its own game--needed a bigger map, perks needed to be redesigned around multiplayer, the whole engine and quest structure needed to be changed.
---
You know, exactly how they said it happened back in that documentary before release. Sometimes things really are what they say they are.
---
This and the Better Inventory mod are game changing. 
---
What's with the attitude ?
---
Careful you might be part of next video. Calling you mean things for calling them out
---
This. PvP.  You couldn‚Äôt get revenge in a pve server.
---
Thank you.  I knew the TS bonus was being reduced, did not recall the Explosive bonus was being nerfed at the same time.  So you get a 25% bonus for TS and a 20% bonus for explosive now.  That is not unreasonable as bonuses go.  Of course compared to the over the top bonus it used to have its a substantial reduction.  See stuff like this in other games where an OP weapon got nerfed, you make adjustments.
---
buy stuff lol, buy serums or plans u dont have and continue replenishing to the cap limit.
---
also, drop the junk that isnt needed, for example u will never need more than 100 raw cloth. The same applies for other common junk.
---
I craft ammo to reduce steel quantities, and craft certain weapons to break to learn new mods. i bought the lever action rifle plan and the gauss rifle plan.
---
i craft like 5 or 6 and then break for mods. This reduces loads of junk and keeps my stash in check. It also gives me mods at the same time.
---
Lakes do sound nice, thanks! First pin in the map for me to check :)
---
Thats exactly the point of it.
---
People just dont like having to make choices. "I cant carry 100grenades and 20 mininukes because i have to carry food and water." 
---
The classic online game content cycle, once content has been played, less people, new content, more people again, rinse and repeat.
---
Reason your getting downvoted throughout the thread here buddy. Your opinions do not line up with the community at all.
---
Ponder this thought also loooove the fact you have less than 100 karma. You are not very liked on this sub at all lol. So your opinion means almost nothing to me as i don't consider you even apart of the community i am speaking with.
---
Enjoy your night and try to be a better person if you wish to be apart of the 76 community.
---
Y'know I think I might have set up there at one point! Maybe I should go back that direction. Thanks for the comment :)
---
MEATY MEEEEEAT
---
Every now and then, empty your inventory of everything, at a train station, then sell to the vendor bot, with only 3Cha and hard bargain maxed, you can sell fibreglass, Nuclear Material, any junk item that doesn't have a "Bulk" option, for 2 caps a piece.
---
Decide how much of each you want to keep, then dump everything back into the inventory, and take the excess out, and do a round of visiting all your known traders. You can both empty out some decent weight and make at least a grand if you've got a load of junk you don't use. I know it works with Gold, Fibreglass, Antiseptic, and Circuits. Get rid of drugs, short life foods, and weapons/armour you don't use or "might use one day"- accept it, that day will never come. 
---
Dump ammo you aren't using, Flatwoods is always a good choice.
---
Craft ammo you need, it uses up the hidden killer that is gunpowder, and eats through lead and steel.
---
&gt;i recommend just popping into this instead of nukacrypt.  
---
Lmao, wut? even enclave's own FAQ says: "Q: HOW ARE THE CODES CRACKED SO FAST?  
---
A: Well thanks to NukaCrypt actually. They gather around every week during code reset to gather the code pieces and decrypt the codes! Without them the codes would most likely take another day to crack."  
---
Yea, enclave is on top of this shit alright. They're on top of pressing F5 until nukacrypt has the code, and then copying it to their own site, lol.  
---
?Me Me Me Me ME!
---
 That would be lovely thanks you :)
---
You're an idiot. 
---
I know right. Wasting 3 points on weight means i only have 53 left for other stuff.
---
We need MOAR!
---
It does not make sense. At what point does it stop? Sally doesn‚Äôt like keeping up with food and water so we need different servers where that isn‚Äôt an issue.  Joey doesn‚Äôt like super mutants so we make different servers without monsters.  This is a pvp game.  Realize that and you‚Äôll all have a better time.
---
I have one, and i thought it would have atleast double damage it have. You would have hard time killing group of super muties if they spot you. Becouse 130damage with that awful loading time is crazy weak. (Better than nothing, i like you are giving it free to nooooobiiiiees, just want to tell you, i dont like this gun)
---
Ya I avoid Charleston like the plague because that is all it does is freeze up. Very very annoying...
---
Jack some downvoters in the thread downvoting all for the ideas. Just so you know i did upvote these posts for ya.
---
Bethesda made it so that you can't tun in (or hold on to) more than one technical data at a time, after you get the quest. You get random rewards from turning it in, so the good stuff can drop after 1 or 50. You can also get BOS combat armor plans from the two Grafton vendors.. rare
---
You want to be protected from the game.  Go play call of duty and complain about being killed.
---
Also post here on your main account i would love to see it.
---
Man, I feel your pain. The only reliable 3* legendary farm for me *was* Uranium Fever -- unfortunately since the last patch I can't get anything above lvl 40 to drop. Nuke zones I can get lvl 50, but only 1*. 
---
I've been commenting this all over the place in hopes Bethesda sees it, but a Legendary system in which you could strip and apply single modifiers from legendary weapons and armor to your own shit would be incredible. 1* anti armor rolling pin? Hell yeah! AA modifier in the bank! Even if it costed like 25 stable flux to do...it would give so much more meaning to grinding that stuff.
---
That's just my two cents, anyways.
---
The game is great. The forums are toxic with whiners who hate being forced to *gasp* make choices.
---
I so agree with this!! I‚Äôve spent so many hours farming the warden quest to get my handmade rifle schematic with no luck. Been server hopping for several days now loading screen takes forever. Would love something to listen to.
---
Hard no.
---
in reality : employee doesn't give a fuck
---
Got plenty of chameleon and rifles. I have just been chucking them in low level bases as they arent what I am looking for.
---
It‚Äôs about both. If running round in a funny outfit, shooting stuff, then playing the banjo is your idea of a good time then that‚Äôs fine - but for people who want to probe a bit more into the mechanics there are still many broken balances. 
---
I get the mindset.  I used to play a fair amount of The Division and was bemused when I teamed up with people who were very stat focussed and asked me lots of questions about my build and DPS, as I didn‚Äôt want to go that deep into it. Was I glad that stuff toiled along beneath the surface, though? That there were those who would complain when it started to get out of whack? You bet. It was an important bedrock,  even if I only ever dipped a toe into those waters, and when it didn‚Äôt all add up the game as a whole was weakened. 
---
Have fun with the wackiness. I would never suggest otherwise. Embrace that for all that the game is, though, and everyone loses out eventually. 
---
I had a level 10 Chameleon Leather Leg drop weeks ago and that was the last I've seen of them. If I ever do get a Chameleon Heavy Leather piece I will never, ever take it off :)
---
My brother is just getting into the game, level 11, this is his favorite weapon, he likes the sound it makes lol
---
Or perhaps they just make videos about current and popular subjects. It's so typical of you Bethesda fanboys to suspect some kind of conspiracy or agenda just because someone made a negative video about the game.
---
But physically and literally its a disc ...
---
I feel like I‚Äôm posting here daily at this point but:
---
PS4: I have found the cause of why enemies keep dying randomly as if they are having an aneurism. The cause is that with 24 people on a server, it‚Äôs possible they will be in 24 different locations meaning that 24 locations worth of enemies need to spawn.
---
HOWEVER the active enemy cap cannot hold that much meaning that other places will randomly be chosen to have everything there die, taking Loot, XP and Legendaries with them.
---
The other cause are Nuke Zones, with how fast things spawn there, that can account for a good 2-3 places worth of enemies, especially if it‚Äôs the whitespring (Surprise Surprise) or other popular locations.
---
There are several ways to solve this issue that I can see but each have their own drawbacks.
---
1: Leave it as is and players can get aggravated that their loot is gone, especially if it‚Äôs a legendary.
---
2: increase the number of active enemies on the server BUT this will likely further destabilise servers.
---
3: reduce the number of enemies in an area with the offset being that Late game players get shafted as less enemies means less difficulty (if there was any). This would also nerf Nuke Zones which is another horrible move.
---
4: (only one with ONLY upsides). rush to get Private servers out so that server stability and all this other junk is a non issue for players, Solo or not.
---
This is just my ideas but if there are others, let‚Äôs hear them. 
---
Do you want longer loading screens? 
---
Because that‚Äôs how you get a loading screen for loading music for the loading screen 
---
Absolute class!!!!
---
Terrible comparison. You‚Äôre comparing a single player fallout game to a multiplayer game.
---
I didn‚Äôt have crashes at all, the only legitimate point you made was some missions were bugged. 
---
I have a spare BoS: Initiate plan if you would be interested in purchasing? Got two from handing in the tech data... although I must have done 50+ hand ins. 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox but won‚Äôt be able to get online for about 6 hours. 
---
No, its just the new rifle legendary. No two shot, no explosive. Good for a sniper after Bethesda nerfs everything.
---
Stream your base location.  I‚Äôll come smash it for you and then you can hunt me down.  I‚Äôll have a wanted marker and a bounty.  I wont be able to see you coming.
---
That‚Äôs how the game works.  It‚Äôs not little lamplight where I can‚Äôt kill you because your a kid.
---
Min Maxing is useless.
---
Its not like you need it to kill everything and have fun.
---
Probably because I haven't played the previous game, I don't really have anything to compare with, that's where my enthusiasm here comes from. I do agree, that adapting is an option, but then again, we can adapt to having energy weapons break after 4 shots.. we can adapt to having to wait for full reload animation, in order to be able to shoot a Lever rifle.. we can adapt to many things, however we can also express our opinions and hope that something will be changed.
---
I mean, they do live in quite a harsh environment. 
---
You need a low level to spawn them. I got into Whitesprings the other day and killed about 20 of them, after a bunch of level 20+ guys roamed the area.
---
This happened to me, basically there's an item in your inventory that is a quest item, but it's component parts still show up in your junk when you're trying to craft. So, you don't actually have the parts you need since you can't break down the quest item. Once you collect a bit more (most likely its springs or screws, fucking springs and screws...) you'll be able to craft it.
---
agreed, loading screen is so long and boring. And it interrupts the main music from the starting page.
---
Nice! &lt;3
---
No doubt fallout 76 has its issues but what in trying to say is. All the points I made are in new Vegas as well as 76. You want to tell me new Vegas has never crashed on you? Or you've never experienced a bug in new vegas?
---
r/redditsings
---
Your not the only one that feels that. However, I think every build should have positives and negatives and this should still feel alittle like a multiplayer survial game even at max level. That said, we still need the big pvp balance patch that I assume will eventually come and probably the patch after that before things are equal enough to not feel fairly frustrated by things like weight issues. 
---
As for my rifleman character, I just have to limit him to three or so weapons only to balance the weight and ammo/duriability concerna. It gets the job done well, even through both a silo and a queen fight, but ya, it is not as forgiving as other builds for sure. On the plus side though, I can sneak kill and fight effectively out of power armor unlike my heavy weapons guy.
---
Yea, I love the game (level 107 and 150+ hours), but yesterday was the first day that I just didn't feel like playing. The only quests left for me are for launching a nuke and killing the queen.. there just hasn't been a lot of high level players on any server that I join. Not to mention, and this part is my fault, I can't fast travel due to weight. If I launch a nuke, chances are that I won;t be able to join the fight right away lol
---
At the risk of losing my spot...
---
If you scroll the map slightly north of where pictured you will see a thistle on the map, no discoverable location.
---
At that thistle there is a pond that contains an acid resource.

I have my camp built out over the water with an acid extractor and several water pumps in my basement.
---
Nice story man :) pretty sure the pic of you sitting on the cliff edge ("Always vigilant during rest to look for more places to loot") is the exact site of my first real C.A.M.P.. I was so proud of it, it lasted one day until I lost it because someone else placed one there, haha.

This is a level 50 rifle, so he couldn‚Äôt use it for quite a few levels.

Kids call their father Daddy. It's not just a kink thing. It's a legit being a dad thing.
---
It's a game like any other really. People play it and either continue or move on, most of my friends didn't last 1 month, yet I'm still here and aside from all the negativity with the game I'm enjoying it. Going at your own pace helps with the no pressure of being the best and having the best item wise. Crashes and long loading screens are killing it for me whereas before I'd add in the exploiters to the list now days though I've moved on from them. While the servers seem full, how many servers were there to begin with compared to how many there are now per platform?

Fallout 76 FAILS AGAIN?? NEW BETHESDA SCANDAL! Fallout 76 going FREE TO PLAY?!
---
Then like a photoshopped picture of a shotgun on a brightly coloured background and someone in excavator PA.
---
And then the video content is uninformed rambling saying "guys" as much as possible with the topic based literally going on this sub and then sorting by top/this week.
---
My head of HR is called suzie. Not sure i want her gums round my chopper though
---
Juicehead also started the free to play crap.  
---
He totally edited this post.  It was originally about a streamer he was trying to white knight for.
---
I always go there when I start a new character just tag them with nades and watch the bar at the bottom go up!
---
If you have your radio on, it does keep playing the music. 
---
There was a good joke and/or pun in there about being a good dad and silently eliminating the kid before he had a chance to know, just like a crossbow.....Hmmmm, I'll think on this as I wake up more
---
BETHESDA BAD

Knowing that you are new to the Fallout games actually makes my position a little stronger, I think.  When you play a new game, be it a franchise title or a new property, do you always feel it should be different than how it was designed and released?  When you play a Zelda game for the first time, should you learn to budget bombs and not use them solely to attack enemies, or should you complain to Nintendo to raise the bomb carry limit to 50, or to remove the limit entirely?  You want this to not be the game and gameplay it was designed to be, which is fine, I guess, but I don‚Äôt see how you would be accustomed to the "must pick up everything" mentality that many long time Fallout players are, and not want or be able to accept the limitations that, for you, have existed in every Fallout game you have played.
---
The Imgur link has been removed?
---
I guess it's more of a mind-set issue then, because while I do have 100 raw cloth, leather, glass etc in my stash, I also have 1000 screws, 1000 gears and same amount of adhesive - those I don't want to get rid off. Same as my chems, for example, I don't want to be forced to sell my 300 Radaways, because I want to be able to stock them. At the end of the day I still had to sell half of what I previously stored to continue playing, but that's why I brought this topic up.. being able to gather more resources for future purposes is what gets my blood pumping in this game. May be I'll open my own mini-mart, when player vending options will be introduced.
---
If vendors didn't have a limit per day, or had at least a bigger one, I'd definitely focus on buying enclave stuff, but untill then I'm stuck where I am.
---
It's a shame there isn't some kind of machine that can easily do tedious and unnecessary computations like this for you.  Some kind of computational machine, that computes things, perhaps.
---
Did it land in a workshop? 
---
Nah, i disagree on the bit on the youtuber hate.  If they want to state their opinion that's fine, but they don't get a free pass.  They wanna criticise, they have to expect criticism themselves.
---
Then if we don't eat them fast enough and are in a bind end up with some foodborn illness from food spoiling in what seems like ten minutes......

Got a lot of fertilizer though
---
You can get the handmade bp as a drop from the Patrol Duty event at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary. While the event sucks and its only a chance it didn't take that long. Vendors seem to know what you want and never stock it. X-x
---
Hey, guess what. If you read the post, I said I like PvP but there needs to be a change for those who *don‚Äôt*. I enjoy taking people out and making a thousand caps on a salty team but not everyone likes that.
---
You got it reversed. You work to get real money.
---
Oh man I have been using this fooorever haha
---
Knowing modern food, it's not too outlandish to think so

Try attacking EA and you'll be labelled 'entitled' by comparison

A treemap would be ideal, but probably too much to ask.
---
Yeah for leveling it is OK. I am talking about 50+
---
New Vegas hasn‚Äôt crashed on me, unless it has but I haven‚Äôt remembered it to do so which means it never was a problem for me. New Vegas bugs were comical at best and didn‚Äôt detract from the overall experience, unless the bugs were missions then it was a problem. Bethesda can‚Äôt afford to let their brand of bugs fester in an online experience, some of them initially were game breaking and affects everyone. 
---
NV masked to a great degree the negatives because the story was so good. If you want to talk about content and ‚Äòend game‚Äô, NV had so many little missions and interesting places to visit it made up for it.
---
They're usually locked if they're dropped from an Enclave-related cargobot (w/ nuclear keycard inside), and unlocked when a US Gov't Supply Requisition used. Can't help with the bounty part, though!
---
I've seen better haircuts on playmobile.
---
You need the key card but not all the nuke codes off the dead officers. Just hop in go to the silo kill the robots and launch the nuke. 
---
I'm not a fanboy, I criticize Bethesda many times for releasing unfinished product and I still think that game is in beta phase, sometimes unplayable and with shitload of problems/bugs. I just learn to live with them and I appreciate the world they've created - I've finished every quest and most of events, have around 300h (111 lvl) in the game and it's fun in some ways. But throwing shit when you didn't play the game (or played for few hours) is just unprofessional. Probably is just their audience demands that kind of videos to feel better, but still...

We‚Äôre neighbours :) very cool!

You need to collect specific types of flowers. If you click on the challenge it will tell you the ones you need to target

Wrong. He made it at the end of the weekly challenges, but it was still last week. And again, notice he said 0/10 not 0/8 which is what it currently is.
---
You just don't want to admit that you are wrong, but that you got schooled. 
---
Sorry about that. 
---
Thought it was just me aswell. Guess it's just another bug.... sigh
---
You can also hit the Xbox button and press Y to screenshot (XB1). You can even just go into your photos in-game and do that, and then clear up space. You just won't see them in loading screens.
---
Um i am trying to say, it is not good for endgame. Dont hate me. I was thinking it would be powerfull, and when i finaly get it, I was disappointed.
---
I search just about everything, even underwater withe aquaboy perk, on top of stuff you have to weirdly angle your self to look at, in open containers (As inyou have to manually look into them). While Dog food is semi common, I don't believe you just casually found 40
---
Yep, tested blood leaf, carrot, the pink one and soot so far. None are registering.
---
Nice
---
Then you'd have situations where people equip those cards, stash items, then unequip the cards. How should that be dealt with?  Do Bethesda even want to let that happen in the first place?
---
Holy shit...
---
You should try ESO
---
Installing 0 mods for NV is a death wish. But I cant bash on my favorite game it definitely had more content. But don't forget. Bethesda said in a year the game physically wont be the same anymore. With map updates and enemy updates aswell. Only time will tell 
---
At first I wanted to argue about the "unlimited" thing, but then I thought to myself, that you are probably right.. whenever we will get an increase of the stash or more ways to increase character weight limit, we will still ask for more, because there's no limit for perfection. But isn't hoarding another aspect of survival as well? When someone is equipped for better or worse, you know what I mean? I love the feeling of knowing, that I will never be out of food or water EVER, that I can heal the whole server with Stimpacks and still have some left for generations to come..
---
It seems like it's a chore, but you would feel oddly dissatisfied without it. The whole game is based off careful inventory management
---
Sigh indeed. Kinda relieved it‚Äôs not just me at least.
---
This is what ur going to have to do. They have more pressing issues then to help us with this
---
Holy shit. I saw that the other day and thought there was no way it would sell at that price.
---
Hah! You hit like radroach!
---
It would be nice to be able to access the photos via the Bethesda account so we can save them on pc. I'm sure it is possible.
---
Im on xbox and what I do is take a screenshot on the console. I then access my screenshots via the xbox phone app and from there I screenshot it on my phone. I can then save it to pc if I choose, just as I would with any other photo I take on my phone.
---
No idea then. I've shot a few down without starting the mission and never became wanted. 
---
I really need to get my sense of dark humor back. Half of it is back.
---
Oh well nevermind.
---
There‚Äôs two kinda of people: the people who haven‚Äôt played fallout and think 76 is a ‚Äúgood game‚Äù and people who have played the fallout games and know that 76 is a dumpster fire.
---
I just screenshot holding the share button on ps4, save directly to capture gallery. You can hide the hud in photo mode as well. The 50 photos do change your load screens though.
---
Isn‚Äôt his name ‚ÄúGrahm‚Äù?
---
and that's a good thing IMO.
---
Still get every bug they said they fixed in last patch...
---
Thats more what I was getting at, I‚Äôm lvl 91, he‚Äôll have plenty of 50+ hand me downs
---
I thought that was Blackwater Mine. Does Lucky Hole Mine have the same setup?
---
Mods ruin games by bastardizing the developers original vision - Not even trolling.
---
I found the Handmade plans in a safe in the toxic valley, town with a shooting gallery, cannot for the life of me remember the name... at level 44-ish, so it definitely does spawn in the world
---
That‚Äôs rediculous. What kind of moron pays actual money to buy things in a computer game?
---
LoL i just commented another post about this gun, that it is not worth carying, every other rifle is just better.
---
When people mark your game as the poorest in a series and give you ratings to reflect, people dislike your game.
---
&gt; Workshops now only offer half their rewards and remain the only zones that pvp is engaged. Outside of the area normal rules apply. This one could be changed somehow if anyone has an idea how these could work as pure pve setups post below.
---
I'd rather make them mini raid areas that will require teamwork and people can share resources. Not an attack/defend of 4 diseased mole rates 20 levels beneath me, but uber behemoths that wants his junk pile back and wants to crush the puny bucket heads taking it away from him.
---
it's fun for a few hours, sure. But the lack of real content is still really painful
---
Candy cane was the name of a notoriously OP and unpleasant "spell" in Anarchy Online heh. Ohhh the memories.
---
We must accept that this is not like previous FO games, and we can not keep everything we find, My Ultracite Armor (repaired to 200%) is going up for sale very soon.
---
I struggle with these decisions, as my previous Play with FO games always involves collecting all the Unique weapons in the game.
---
Damn people are stupid
---
Yeah, exactly.. I haven't even reached that point in the game yet. :( And it's crawling from around the corner with that smug smile on its face.
---
If you didn't call it by yourself (via terminal and holotape) it's someone else's, which makes it close and market you wanted when you steal from it. Bethesda just shouldn't gives you a quest from it, if that wasn't called by yourself, because it suggests it's your's to take...
---
About to start another attempt if your in?
---
All over the map there are random horde quests where you have to fight a horse of a certain type of enemy usually with a legendary at the end as the leader
---
As it turns out, you can pop a bunch of serums, and the health regen heals faster than slap damage. Its dumb. 
---
Im salty, and Im damn sure it wasnt the first time they did it.
---
No hate here. Just trying to explain the rifle properly so no one fets the wrong idea.
---
In a game where all our bases are made of wood, if missles and launchers were so freely kept and available....we'd have a red dead online 2.0 on our hands
---
Is fun. It's a waste of money (unless offers). It's what I, and most people I know wanted. It's not what we should have got.
---
it's  new thing. 
---
On PS4 the photos taken in photo mode also get saved to the gallery like a normal screenshot. So when you reach the 50 limit you can delete them from the game's gallery to make room for new ones while not losing them. The downside to this is there is no way to import them back into the game later if you wanted to use them as loading screens again. 
---
Both of those games are vastly different from this one and 100x more punishing. You literally cant starve to death or thirst to death in fo76. These games are not comparable as they have none of the same mechanics except that you eat and drink. At least in those games you can store as much as you want because you need to in a survival game.
---
Clever one, wait...
---
I just learned of spots to hunt bears, so yeah. The real answer is: do both 
---
&gt;	They should be able to do so without worrying about it all getting blown up by a random. I
---
Particularly one than then proceeds to bleat *‚ÄùI‚Äôm just roleplaying a raider‚Äù* or *‚ÄùIt‚Äôs how the game was meant to be played‚Äù*...
---
Just so you know, pictures taken with photomode are also saved directly to the capture gallery like normal screenshots. 
---
People spend money on silly things all the time. At least this person isn‚Äôt hurting anyone...in real life. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll get some enjoyment out of killing literally everyone in the game. 
---
I just did. Thots begone, beardo.
---
Thought it was against TOS to but stuff with real money or whatever 
---
Pvp isn‚Äôt wasting time any more than literally any other activity in this game.  It‚Äôs kind of the existential point of video games.  To waste time.
---
Looks like IRL California
---
What is rad shield and how is is made or acquired? I've got about 350 hours played but I've never seen it.
---
Based on what they've done so far the average you can earn a week is 540 atoms, not 950. And that's if you're literally signing in 7 days a week and spending your time doing every challenge.
---
It's silly that my character carries twice as much as my stash box. 
---
Im pretty sure that was Quarterings beast, based off pretty decent evidence to at least make a "what do you think" video.
---
Doesn't the seller just mark these things as sold or is that not how this works? 
---
I'm not saying somebody didn't spend the money but $150.00 just seems crazy as hell to me 
---
YongYea IS TRASH
---
When your looking through rose colored glasses, all the red flags are white...
---
IIRC the heavier a weapon is, the longer it takes to aim down sights, according to FO4
---
As an outlooker seeing if the game is worth getting for ¬£7... 
---
You‚Äôre in an echo chamber literally dedicated to F76... obviously people here care for the game enough to be here. You‚Äôre not going to get any traction with what you said. 
---
Woah there miss queen, you're the over reactive on of your friends aren't you
---
&gt; hell the game itself is great value for 60$
---
I disagree. Loving the game, and it's quite fun. If we're counting "$ per hour of fun" then it's very, VERY cheap.
---
However, I still feel selling the game for 60$ in the initial state was wrong. But well, I think selling any game at all for 60$ is wrong so whatever.
---
[This is how i feel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agNNEM0vo1w)
---
It's what I do in real life, but in the game world, where it should have "limitless possibilities", I'm still forced to let go of my hard earned junk and chemistry! :)
---
I do understand what you mean, really, but it's just the way many (I hope it's not just me being an insane hoarded) people see themselves in this world, which is prepared for everything. For example, having enough radaways, stimpacks and canned dog food to heal/feed the whole damn Appalachia. :D
---
Ha. I bought it twice too! Friends help friends play stuff.
---
So, initially I thought the same thing but apparently there‚Äôs a couple variants of the legendary rifle and so far ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù this is one of a kind. Some others were duped and have a base damage of like 120 something and sell for cheap but this one in the pic has a base of about 990 and ignores like 50% armor. 
---
You think mysterious stranger's useless? try mysterious savior, when you automatically give up just from muscle memory, the dying animation lasts just long enough that you see him show up and glare at you
---
Yup - looking at the stats of the character in VATS - its only showing RR from my armor pieces but not from the legendary RR mods.
---
So you didn‚Äôt hear about what I did to all those people coming out of vault 94?
---
I think that my routines just tend to put me in locations where lots of them tend to spawn. 
---
It doesn't, but a build may take 57 levels to complete.  Also higher level players will have access to prime receivers and ultracite ammo which really contribute high dps to the queen.
---
I've seen level 50s that can't rub two caps together.  They have limited ammo and do almost no damage to the queen.  Never mind just cleaning up house around her.  
---
That's where I'm set up! 
---
If your PS4: Get orf ma land!!
---
Otherwise: As you were. 
---
I have a conspiracy theory that professional reviewers purposefully destroyed the game not on it's own merits but by what giving a good score would represent.
---
Yes, it was a buggy, broken mess at launch but I still struggled through. I overlooked a LOT of issues bc I was having fun and kept thinking, "their first multiplayer game, give them some slack. It'll get patched" ESO doesn't count, it was developed by Zenimax, not Bethesda Game Studios.
---
The negative reviews could be attributed to high expectations, bugs, "being released too soon", or changes to core story and gameplay. BUT, I really think the negative reviews were to let Bethesda know that this is not the direction we want our Bethesda games to go in. Battlefield 4 Halo MC collection had terrible launches but didn't get destroyed by reviewers. RDR2, while arguably a beta, also has a ton of glitches and issues. In fact RDR2 had plenty of mission breaking bugs and graphical glitches in the single player too, on a One X even, and it was all glossed over.
---
Since Bethesda likes to fiddle with new game concepts and expand upon them in the next franchise (houses in Skyrim vs settlements in Fo4), a message **should** be sent loud and clear that we don't want the next Elder Scrolls to be like Fallout 76.
---
Don't get me wrong. I like Fallout 76. I've actually enjoyed Fallout more than The Elder Scrolls at times, but this was a risky move and one I don't think they would have used on their beloved ES. However, on an adopted franchise?...
---
If the reception had been overwhelmingly warm then I fear they would have kept the course and we would have wound up with a disappointing Elder Scrolls. Because as much as I like Fallout 76 it also comes with a huge heaping of disappointment.
---
Big companies, especially Bethesda, need to understand their target audience more and should have done more research into what is trending and what works/doesn't work about their games. Even alphas and betas don't work that well because it needs to be developed at its core and those systems are to tweak and improve not to start over from scratch. Same thing happened with ESO. They KNEW it wasn't what players would want, but they pushed it out anyway spending a lot of time fixing it.
---
Ubisoft did a fantastic job with the encouragement of player feedback with Assassin's Creed Black Flag which ultimately helped them develop the two newest and arguably strongest entries in the franchise.
---
Bethesda peeps know how to create a world with lots of complicated moving parts, but they are terrible at offering a streamlined and enjoyable experience sometimes.
---
I just wish Fallout wasn't the franchise led to slaughter and I'm hoping the sacrifice wasn't in vain.
---
Agree there.  He should of gotten wanted again.
---
I have a recipe for a sweetroll.  Might have to get baking! 
---
A lot of things are against the law, but people still do them anyways...
---
&gt; If you want a game where you can hold unrealistic amounts of resources, you may also be happier on there.
---
I mean... I'm only level 25, and with my perks I'm carrying around a few hundred syringes, nearly ten thousand bullets, a full set of armour, four guns, an axe, some binoculars, a couple of dozen meals, 70 bottles of water, and a satchel full of assorted tin cans or brooms or other junk.
---
Clearly the game has already chosen fun over realism.  It just hasn't done a great job of it.
---
Your asking this question.... But how many times have you spent money in other games with micro transactions like the atom shop? 
---
150$ is a fair amount of money imo. It may be a drop in the bucket for others...
---
I would also like to say that on the internet most people are morons.. Hell the average IQ for people in just the u.s. is 85... A plant has an IQ of 60 if I remember correctly...
---
Get the perk that auto uses a stimpack. It works great in situations like that. 
---
Not after explosive nerf. You can have same damage with tse handmade without awful reloading time after every shot (still better than dragon).
---
Lol he just used karma to judge a person , what a self righteous nerd 
---
I think you have a problem with admitting your mistakes.
---
Or do you think he magically guessed that the next week challenges would have flowers again? And he guessed that people would have problems with the challenge? The challenge has multiple flowers 0/10 and you need to 0/8 different flowers.
---
Grow up.
---
Roger that. I'll be on later today between 2 pm - 4 pm CST.
---
I'm Ps4 but i hope this helps any PC players that read it.
---
Meh it'll be duped then op as hell with tse.
---
I‚Äôm pretty server Grahm is instanced to a server so what the above poster meant is that people literally drop a message here and wait in their specific server for others to join.

I'm on Xbox, you?

Metal security doors try Harper's Ferry and BOS vendor.

I have two level 90~ characters, and I've seen him one time lol. I would think yall were making him up if not for that early encounter.

---
The thing is, that once you pick it up, they can take that "object" and just turn it into a reference, or for lack of a better analogy, a "ticket" in terms of it's code. You could store 1,000 t-51 sets as tickets and have no problem. So I don't believe it's that. I believe it may have to do with that many references being tied to each character, to somewhat naturally limit duping and super gangs forming, or they actually store the items as objects from start to finish, but I doubt that, or all of our games would be kill
---
I've seen it happen enough times - under 2 minutes from the nuke touchdown, the queen is toast!
---
It is. Its against the TOS to sell things too.
---
Then they shouldn‚Äôt buy a game that contains pvp? You act like people are forced to play this game . Most of us like the game and bought it for these new aspects in the fo universe . They told you the game had pvp and wouldn‚Äôt have a single player option . Don‚Äôt buy a banana and then complain that it doesn‚Äôt taste like an apple 
---
DAMN! I've got one of these, I *must* be rich!
---
Yea we need shields, all sorts from medieval, to police, to just pure junk like car doors or even just palettes. they could work with bot melee and one handed weapons like Pistoles, which would be a huge buff for Pistole users!
---
Ok dictionary dood.
---
Its about however we want to play it
---
don't you fucking quote Bojack horseman, not today Bobby 
---
Not just Explosive bobbleheads, people are stacking duped Luck ones for better condition loot, etc.  So fix stacking of bobbleheads and magazines entirely.
---
Did not know this, thanks!!!
---
nah
---
Princess Caroline to be exact ;)
---
I wish the completion of each major DLC would give a single bonus stat point. That way once they have 4 big DLC out, if you do them, you could have a total of 60 in all stats. Then you could have a few more points for weight reduction cards. Maybe cap it at 60 though. :)
---
You new to the internet? When I remember things like this starting people were selling everquest items for 1000's of dollars.
---
Different words have different meanings.... "dood."
---
First time I ran into him he teleport Ed right behind me, and I turned 180 and TSE fucked me right over. Marvelous. 
---
That sounds amazing!
---
I wish the completion of each major DLC would give a single bonus stat point. That way once they have 4 big DLC out, if you do them, you could have a total of 60 in all stats. Maybe cap it at 60 though. :)
---
I can see how at the start to mid game it can be like that since you need to scrap etc. to progress. A certain amount of skill cards need to be for weight reduction, lv3 tru hiker/bandolier/(the chem one :p) are not always needed.
---
When clearing mobs you are probably better off leaving stuff liek muttchop etc. They weigh too much in comparison to other far more effective food. With chems, ammo and scrap you will just have to recognize when not to pick up crap.
---
The true game changer will be when you get 1 armor piece that has food/chem/drink weight reduction. I agree there are times inventory management is a bit much, mostly when you are trying to progress weapon/armor upgrades. Outside of that, it is manageable if you just set priorities. Personally when I leave base I have about 115 free space. This is w/o PA and 3 to 4 weapons.
---
Oh my god this isnt feature? im no way near having the PA frame so i was just patiently waiting for the day i dont have to carry it or stash it. Fuck.
---
I guess it simply comes from my current experience.. I simply feel that it's limiting my enjoyment of the game. To be honest, I don't even have any other survival game to compare FO76 with, so may be you are right. Overall it makes me feel prepared for anything that might come. I have ammunition for every weapon in the game, I have the possibility to craft even more of it if necessary. I have so much dog food, that I don't have to bother with having to search for food to replenish my health/food meter. Same goes for chems: I am prepared for when I need to fight a tough enemy and not die EVER. I like to have this feeling of freedom, and I don't see how it's ruining everyone else's experience, so that's where I'm coming from with this.
---
Just remove pvp feom the game imo.  Ot doesn't need pvp Mr the  balance issues pvp cuase.
---
I guarantee you I'd put effing money on it that the majority of the hate train is from pvpers anyway I've seen that mentality come from pvpers in other games.
---
I suppose you are best friends with everyone from your high school, college, Reddit, etc.?  That‚Äôs the point.  We are not all going to be friendly and that adds the danger the devs were going for.  It‚Äôs fundamental to the game. Regardless of the downvotes, it is the basic nature of the wasteland.  Raiders exist in fallout and raiders can be vault dwellers too.
---
It still is closer to a multiplayer survival game than a singleplayer quest driven game.
---
I'm not talking about the youtuber or the person that made the news site article. You guys need to learn to read. I was talking about the people that made concerned posts about it on reddit.... Not everyone made a troll post about it on reddit most made posts saying things like we should be given atom compensation, etc. Concerned consumers, etc.
---
I'm just an angry boring man.
---
#DURKA DUR! 
---
This would involve a whole new system whereas making decks swapable seems like a much easier fix.  Also im a bit confused as to how bethesda would limit perks if they activate at a certain level/special and dont need to be 'inserted' or selected.
---
Um, the difference here is Bungie were DELIBERATELY pairing you with people who owned micro-transaction items you didn‚Äôt, whilst making it harder to earn them with the more xp you gained during the week the less you earned per kill to encourage the sale.
---
This isn‚Äôt that, Betheada don‚Äôt pair you deliberately in the games code with people who have things you don‚Äôt,
---
The atom store is optional, and if i bought a bunch of skins, it doesn‚Äôt effect you.
---
Stop moaning about trivial things, and complain about things that matter....
---
Using half a picture to paint a full image doesn‚Äôt work, even for a simile.
---
Key cant be resold either.
---
Yeah. What is worse is having 5 PAs taking up space in your stash. 
---
50 pounds! And if they change how frames weigh in future, it could be way more. 
---
They both posted videos around the same time and quarterings 'evidence' was simply an unstated number of people 'around the world'.

That map confirms that the reason I thought all vendors shared caps is that I‚Äôm a noob who has only ever seen the western half of the map lol.

It all makes sense now lol

Also thanks for the map

Opened yes, even bought item for more than 5000 atoms, but never spend a cent to buy atoms - all were earned during the game.
---
They would be limited by your SPECIAL score. no need to active, or swap, anything.
---
Yes, if most of it is spent with music playing, then yes.
---
hmm, guy sells shocks for 2 k and now you pop up asking 4k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhnsC2V4_0w
---
While I don‚Äôt like simple fetch quests either, I did enjoy the DMV one because of the story/script.
---
Microtransaction = part of money go on game developments. 
---
Not when you first log in. That's the one that takes the longest too.
---
You should post a pic dude. People will be hitting you up with offers like crazy lol

---
boi now you gone and done it, I don't know what the winky is implying, but it was Wanda that said it 
---
&gt; I don't want to pvp, any way whatsoever
---
Then why did you buy a game where there are in-depth developer commentaries explicitly stating that they like the design and idea that anyone could come up and beat you to death if they really wanted to?
---
Like fun over realism is so black and white. Peesh
---
True, you can't have turned on your radio until you are in the game. But since he said loading screens, I'm assuming he meant all loading screens, like when you fast travel or zone into a place. 
---
Same for me.  Of my really active previous game friends of 100, only 1 now plays a few hours but he's not into F76.  Of my dozen or so new in F76 friends, only 1 is still playing, but only for the Challenges really.  So I am at lvl 140, hit 25k Caps last night and got the CAMP sliding doors as well.  My stash is at 600 forever, my PA's are sweet for me as are my melee and gun weapons.  I have been lead and plastic farming all week to make 1,000s of 5.56 and shotgun ammo.  I have enough stable flux to build whatever.  Oh and I finally put on some legendary, armour just to makeut even harder to due unless I TSE myself.  So apart from the Stone Benches plan I am pretty much set for playing Anthem Beta.  With no increase to Stash, Caps, new plans for CAMP (That new ATOM bed is embarrassingly bad, what the fuck Bethesda) and only a promise of fixes and new content.  If the "new content" when it comes breaks as much as the patches I'll be back in 2021 maybe.
---
I love Fallout, but this game is now for the die hards and a few new players who bought it cheap.
---
This community seriously need to stop giving a fuck about youtubers.  
---
Otherwise, you will turn this community into a weird cult like the Star Citizen community which, at some point, was so overprotective about their franchise that you had to justify every single piece of criticism with the phrase "Don't get me wrong. I love this game but...".  
---
In other words.  
---
If this continues youtubers will make videos about this community in a year instead of the game.
---
Seriously, the kiddy shit needs to stop. We need some cool paintjobs for our weapons and armor. 
---
Luckaaaaay! XD in lvl 285 and my friend gave them to me lol
---
Nah I just sometimes forget that there are people with ridiculously large disposable incomes.
---
Then in that case good sir, it would be irrelevant to the topic at hand?  Nonetheless I do get excited upon gaining that mutation.  
---
I would love more serious styles and outfits.  Bethesda seems to be going for the goofy stuff. 
---
I was wondering about this. I haven't really checked. It's good to know. 
---
because the developer stated that you can play that game solo if you wish. And that's what I play.
---
Because comparing a believable thing to a completely unbelievable thing makes sense. Obviously more people were pondering if it could be true then they could ignore or they wouldnt have officially commented.
---
Green stuff for Chally Moo-Moo.
---
I thought you couldn't trade or drop something with an atom purchased paint job?
---
I've made a few posts -- I'm holding out for trades for super specific weapons, though. Someone did see it in my inventory in-game a few days ago, though, and they proceeded to follow me around for 15 mins requesting trade for it. Was pretty funny!
---
I mean fair, but in the climate and state of Bathesda (Im meaning confirmed stuff, and blatant controversy which hasn't been handled, but yes talked to death) I don't doubt it was a significant number. I still think that was more Quarterings fault it blew up because some of the articles posted by reporters were referencing and linking his video, meaning even if they posted the same time, Juice wasn't the reason it became a bit issue.
---
I enjoy having the cases to display, but I do have a lot of digital games so I can game share with my friend. 
---
And you can.
---
CleanPrince is a fucking Cancer. I find that he only has negative things to say about ANYTHING. It's very rare he comes out with a positive video on something. 
---
I know right? Would have been awesome if it was an attachment to a weapon or something like that.
---
r/showerthoughts
---
So you just missed the entire point, got it.  
---
Yeah, you're right. I agree. I'd say a lot of things we do as humans, especially in a society as progressive as ours has become, is a waste of time in the grand scheme of things. I guess I should rephrase my statement by saying "PVP in this game is not how I want to waste my time." By calling it a waste of time, I mean it provides no value to me, whereas playing the rest of the game at least brings me fun and entertainment. If that wasn't implied in the context of what I initially stated, I apologize. Generally, I go to PVP centric games like PUBG, Battlefield, Rocket League, etc. if I want to PVP. While I find that 76 does some aspect of PVP and griefing better than say GTA Online or Red Dead Online, I find my enjoyment of Bethesda games like TES and FO in the exploration aspect, something that I can't do if I'm being hounded by people that find their joy in disrupting other player. I have encountered some that try to PVP and leave after a couple shots fired with no response. That's how I'd prefer people handle PVP but I don't make the rules, nor am I asking anyone to cater to my desires. 
---
There just needs to be peaceful servers where the only PVP engagements are in workshops and events. That‚Äôs it.  
---
Then PVP servers where everyone and everything is fair game.
---
Then go to fo4 and mod it. This game is not for you. 
---
Wait wuuuhh?
---
I never sold calibrated shocks?
---
I think you are confused on what mods I'm selling... Look at my history, I've been trying to buy calibrated shocks forever...
---
I literally just posted this and the moderator didn't like my title... you are not alone. This is what I posted:
---
I've dealt with her flying off the map.
---
I've dealt with her never landing.
---
I've dealt with lag so bad you hardly see her.
---
I've dealt with her winning via server disconnect.
---
Now I have to deal with her taking zero damage?
---
Last night we talked someone already in charlie to launch on the queen. Around 10 people showed up with the majority being over 100 and the rest over 70 and there were multiple times when she just stopped taking damage. I broke my TSE. Then I broke my Zealot's Prime combat rifle. Then I almost broke an explosive rifle on her. 4,000 rounds of 5.56 and 2,000 rounds of .45 and the event ends and she has a sliver of health. There were points where she took no damage for minutes at a time. I had the best point of view standing on a building with everyone in front of me and saw no shirkers. Everyone was laying into her with bloodied and TSE or whatever they had. Before and after the "bug" her health was shrinking rapidly.
---
Is this new or am I just "lucky" that I've never seen this before?
---
Of course someone buys that for 150. They are most likely a duper who's already made alot of money from the game, they will now dupe the weapon and sell them at $40-50 a pop, making hundreds of dollars
---
Correct, I am mistaken and shall take my leave. Good day.
---
All the heavy weapons perks apply to the flamer and cryolator, so both weapons inherit those peek benefits regardless of damage type and effect. Both are energy damage type, and so use ER to determine final damage. Fire burns targets over time, and Cryolator slows targets, just like Skyrim.
---
You must be decently new to your relationship if you aren't at the "Yeah, uh huh" stage and you can completely tune out 
---
I did not buy the game, hence I have no way of playing it or trying it.  How can I form an opinion or as you have so eloquently put it "earn the right to have an opinion"?
---
Use Google 
---
The reference to bungie was made towards the rising amount of daily posts about the same subject that players wanted changed ( in this case eververse). In my case it is about daily posts about stash, perk managing, power amor displays.  Not towards the atom shop. Yes the destiny community got to a point where it full on revolted against the cash shop. But here it's about things that modders fix and that bethesda does not give any news about. NOT about the ATOM shop. I have 0 issues with the ATOM shop. If players get to that same point here it will not be about the atom shop but about game mechanics like stated above.   
---
Lol fuck that dude specifically. Most biased, uninformed and annoying one of those fallout youtubers. All he does is hate on the game.
---
Not remove, I understand that some people might enjoy that aspect of the game, but they can't understand, that most don't and that's why we need to make strict PvP and PvE servers with rules that won't allow griefers to harass people on PvE servers...
---
Just block them Necro its much easier to block these people that don't understand and just want to pick at one example of it. Likely we will never convince them as to the why
---
It's on gameflip, a transaction has to take place for the item to be marked sold. Though it's possible the seller could have made another account and bought it from themselves.
---
Yep and not used any money to buy anything, only atoms earned in game.. so what was your point again?
---
I've completed patrol duty 24 times now without getting the handmade gun plan, so I sincerely hope this to be true... but I would imagine more than one person would've found and reported this since the patch.
---
I personally haven't seen the handmade gun plan neither before nor after the patch, and I check all vendors daily on two characters, including the Harpers Ferry vendor.
---
If they cant increase stash size, maybe at least make some stuff weigh a little less. Despite these weight related problems some of us have, still loving the game.
---
Nah bro the red rocket jump suit lets you wear your underarmor the rocket girl suit was a earlier release in fo4 that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt wear underarmor with that one 
---
Less dumpster fire and more amorphous blob that isn't really sure what it wants to be so it's terrible at everything. 
---
Cool, thanks for the info. What I was trading wasn't really worth stealing.
---
Then why are you using and talking about Destiny and Eververse then when it has nothing to do with  what you‚Äôre actually saying? 
---
You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre saying man.
---
actually we should be distilling water in the game to make it consumable not just boiling it...and yes we should be able to make cranberry moonshine 
---
the hate is deff well deserved. i played the beta, enjoyed it pre ordered and "tried to play" on a off since. i recently gave it a good month break in hopes of it being "playable". Decided to give it a go monday night to get my fallout fix in. When i loaded into the game my character was a floating head for 10 mins. when my body finally loaded my character didnt have hands. 5 min later the server crashed and i couldn't reconnect to a server. This is being played on a PS4 Pro with constant internet speed of 175+/mbps download and 100+/mbps upload. The game is dog shit and will always be dog shit. It will NEVER be fixed because Bethesda wont put much more resources into it. It will be dead by fall.  
---
Just like the other dude, you either missed the point entirely, or think you're being clever when you're not.  
---
you're not the person who will say what game is or isn't for me...
---
I thought 100 was the average? Now I feel smart lol
---
Right. All these plans for this nice furniture, now that I‚Äôve learned them better put up a turret for defense aaaaaand my budgets gone with food
---
I sort of disagree. I do not often PVP, unless I am defending myself, and nor do I have any interest in raiding other people's shit.
---
But leaving PVP as sort of an open ended thing, in my opinion, enhances the immersion experience. You're not protected. This is the wasteland and people want to kill you. 
---
Trolls downvote posts they don't like and make ludicrous comments on any little suggestion or feedback they don't like. Does that mean they are right? As If a handful of posts out of the 60 posted here every day is such a inconvenience for you and your troll army that you all have to down vote them all and make snide remarks like yours above. Maybe you should re evaluate who the monkey is. Because I'm pretty sure that downvoting and troll posting on concerned consumers posts to bury them classifies you as the poo slinging monkey... But on the internet the trolls are the hero's somehow. Makes sense I guess?
---
Yeah right? How messy was this room?
---
No I think you missed the point. I haven‚Äôt paid any money for anything in this game. And if I had it would be a micro transaction back to the company. Not some random dude on the internet. 
---
Risky click of the day
---
Maybe some points in luck will help in the future. Sorry for your loss. TSE laser sounds fun.
---
True. Yeah, I don‚Äôt get why they have to be like that.
---
The game might have some flaws but the only toxic thing it has are some of the players...  both in game and here.  Oh, and yeah, lots of toxic barrels!
---
I use a non legendary hunting rifle. The reload doesn't matter when you're VATS one-shotting everything from stealth. If I try and do the same with a TSE handmade I miss about 80% of my shots.
---
it's still a simular situation. Every day the top posts become more and more about these issues. Keep gaining more upvotes and more momentum. 
---
It's the situations that are getting more alike. 
---
I know perfectly well what i am saying. 
---
This is why I abandoned my explosive shotgun build for a wolverine-esque unarmed build. Being god isn't enough for me. I need a hint of danger, and the spray of my enemie's blood on my lips. Fear me, wasteland beasts. For I am your Alpha, and Omega. I have come to test your mettle, and I have found you wanting. Jesus Christ, I need a new gaming obsession...
---
I mean, as watered down as the mechanics are, it's still meant to be a survival game. It should have limits. 
---
F76 is not F2P so all income dev's will get is from micro-transactions (like i.e. PoE) - it's fully paid game...
---
THIS
---
Literally just take a few minutes to memorize what's what.
---
As for in game, you actually can see what the Weapon's effect is by inspecting it
---
I don't love that many CAMP items are only obtainable through the atom shop, especially because the thing I had most fun doing in FO4 was building. I've already paid $80 for the game. I should be able to get this stuff to build without spending more money :+\
---
I think the people that whine about Youtubers are just as bad.  Do what I do - just ignore Youtube and play the game!
---
You can just remove the paint job prior to trading/dropping.
---
Not as much as j47 hated it!
---
No, I get it.      I just figured we could compile a list for everyone to reference, but ur a jackoff
---
That's gonna be a bummer if you guys log in and one camp is taken lol. 
---
 stinky meat 
---
Ah, I've been sneaky my whole playthrough--currently running with bird bones and a nice, silenced gauss--but when I *really* want to stab someone repeatedly in the face without them knowing, I should go all wood? 
---
I do have a better sneak chest piece, but it'd be fun to get a full set.
---
Mental health is a different ball game, illness is a 3rd party to a relationship and that‚Äôs why the battle music has personally helped me to cue my no take it personally, this is boss aggro not pvp/griefing. 
---
I ran to two random super mutants in the mire talking because I thought it was grahm 
---
They really need to make team CAMPs able to connect. It would be great. Some would use it, some wouldn't. I for one like that me and my teammates' CAMPs are spread out so we can fast travel for free between regions. But also one of my teammates is super low level, and I am sure he would benefit from a connected CAMP to mine. 
---
Am I the only one that's played since day 1 with maybe 1 or 2 PVP engagements?  And one of those was the time I accidentally ate a dude instead of reviving him.
---
&gt; No I think you missed the point. I haven‚Äôt paid any money for anything in this game.
---
Maybe you should refresh your own memory with your original post that started this conversation because you clearly can't even keep track of your own "point" since it's changing every other post now.   
---
I'm gonna assume you're just a troll and not this dumb, and quit wasting my time engaging.  
---
Ok, 
---
I know the place you're talking about. 
---
I was just going to another random encounter spawn. 
---
I'll keep trying at the one you suggested, but the only thing I could find there was a lvl. 92 glowing deathclaw which I'm not high enough level to tame. 
---
No they are not I like to watch golf videos
---
And Bethesda needs to fix that. There're definitely ways to make both sides satisfied.
---
If you have it I‚Äôll take it
---
Yes, you must not engage because the encounter is bugged, most of the time. She might land and then it‚Äôs a few seconds if I can land the hits without dying.
---
No, you don‚Äôt. The top posts are always about stopping and banning dupers and the exploits. I‚Äôve seen a couple maybe 1/5 posts in total since release talk about the Atom Store. What other people buy has NOTHING to do with you.
---
And what situations? Explain, because this is NOTHING like a Destiny Situation. At all. I don‚Äôt even know how you link the two games and their completely separate issues together. People complained because THEY wanted en emote that was locked behind a paywall...
---
You‚Äôve said alot, but very little about the problems YOU have. What is YOUR problem?
---
Content? Bugs? Glitches? Atom store? Story keeps changing dude so which is it? Either way. You can‚Äôt talk about Tess, and the Eververse, whilst sitting there saying ‚Äúim not talking about the atom store‚Äù because that‚Äôs EXACTLY what the eververse was. Cosmetic micro-transaction store.
---
Why anyone would ever waste their time watching some kid on YouTube blows my mind.
---
I just don't get the fascination of watching other people talk on a video. To each their own I guess.
---
New characters share challenges with the rest of your account. 
---
RMT - move along...
---
And that is how you end up with government acronyms.
---
Fair do's. Thanks. 
---
They also love to give us a history recap in every new video about nuka dark and the canvas bag thing .
---
People want to be part of the hating.  If you go a forum, and you made up a stupid flaw for the game, people will take it has a truth and run with it.  People is desperate to find flaws in Fallout 76.  And... yea,  have a lot of bugs, but guys,  these people need to find something more real to hate than a game with flaws. 
---
Had this too. Couldn't repair some weapons (armor was fine for some reason, and not all weapons were effected). Put all my junk in my inventory and repaired. Logged out since it was late with all the junk in my inventory. Got back the next day and haven't had the problem since. Don't know what fixed it but it worked.
---
The second glitch is the same as the disappearing meat heaps.
---
Hey, I remember you.
---
You were doing the same thing with another account that got reddit banned.
---
I can tell because you are still using the same spreadsheet as before.
---
Mods, just ban him now and get it over with.
---
Bethesda, what's up with atom shop in general? Is this a Fallout game or Disneyland?
---
That‚Äôs honestly hilarious. üòÇ I‚Äôve done the same before and I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. 
---
If i'm thinking rightly you're talking about "The Quartering". A garbage Human being who stirs controvesy and runs the "gamers = infallable, developers+publishers = evil scum" narrative.
---
Bonus fact: before starting TQ Jeremy was a part of the Magic: The Gathering competitive scene, which wizards of the coast removed him from for (alleged, but it wouldn't surprise me) harrasing a female cosplayer.  
---
lol, not spreading but caught creating a fresh new exclusive rumour. Anyway he monetised his rumour and correction video so life goals achieved.
---
Why not both
---
I'm sure (though not 100%) that if you build a brand new set it comes with prototype as standard
---
I'm never using the armor bench again. I'll just buy new armor.
---
Yeah it was fun as all hell, i was also doing a riflemen build...Sorta...
---
They don't want caps.  They are a Real Monet Transactions seller.
---
This is a new account for them because the last one was Reddit wide banned for the same shit.
---
F*ck off from here and from the game(pretty please).
---
I personally don't enjoy fallout 76, not that it's a bad game, it just doesn't click like the other fallout games did for me, but if someone enjoys something, I am not a person who would try to ruin others fun. So you do you lol
---
I love how you have a chest piece up for $10 lmao. Like 10 whole dollars for a chest piece that is only 2*. 
---
I mean hey if you bamboozle stuff from people and they actually buy I guess you make money but I hope nobody is stupid enough to spend so much on a piece of armor LMAO
---
ah, the old 'i'm wrong but i cant admit so i'll just try and bluff my way out of it by calling the other person a troll' routine. surprised you didnt invoke hitler. 
---
explain to me exactly how i have in any way conflicted with my original statement ' What kind of moron pays actual money to buy things in a computer game? ' ?
---
All you did was mention the Atom shop. My statement still stands. People who spend their money to buy atoms to buy stuff in games are morons, in my opinion. 
---
I have bought stuff in the atom shop. I have not bought atoms. I used credit i earned in game. No 'actual money' was used. 
---
So, either come back with a sensible response where you actually explain what you mean or quit wasting MY time.
---
you could be entirely right and i could be entirely wrong, but we'll never know unless you explain what you mean.
---
Cats and eagles.
---
PC sorry
---
Then that was the place I was thinking of - it's a great site so close to the Vendor and all those plans/loot, right? :D
---
I never accused you of ruining anyone‚Äôs experience.  There is potential that you could, if what Bethesda says about the servers not being able to handle the item loads is true.  And we know it is somewhat true, due to dupers crashing the servers.  I easily had tens of thousands of pounds of stuff stored in Fallout 4.  The only thing that affected the game, or loading, was the amount of items I had *outside* of storage.  But, given how much of the code was rewritten, and how much Bethesda sucks at servers, I am not willing to bet they are wrong about what they can handle.  
---
As for the rest of what you said, I think you are actively avoiding what their vision of survival looked like when they made it this way.  In Fallout 4, you could have all of the "perks" at one time, if you leveled high enough, but in this game, they intended the player to specialize.  A melee build, for instance, should be carrying their weapon, and one or two backup weapons, and one or two ballistic weapons for range, plus ammo for those weapons, but not 40 pounds of other, unnecessary ammo.  Then, if you feel like switching to a ballistic focused build, you either use a gun you find, or you go somewhere and make one, and then make ammo for it, which you clearly have the supplies to do.  The intent was never for the player to carry 10 guns, keep 20 more at camp, and then also hoarde ammo, that‚Äôs why there are limits.  You can play the game any way you want, but you are *intended* to play within the loose set of rules the developer envisioned for that particular world.
---
Former Electronics Boutique/GAME UK employee here. Failing games went into the bargain bin, if they continue to fail they get pulled completely and sent back to the warehouse
---
Not calling the game a failiure, and personally love it, but chances are this is a retailer decision, not the precursor to F2P
---
I was under the impression that some people are using this game to launder money.
---
Oh yeah i also couldn't repair it all the time, due to the fact circuitry is nearly as hard as finding good loot off regular legendary corpses. 
---
Ran over to check after you posted this--I think I may have found my new home. There's a coal node up on the top of that cliff too, if anyone's looking for it
---
Ofc ! Dogs are people's best friends !
---
Hey wait, I think I camped there too! Yes, I had forgotten all about that place. Thanks for the reminder, I may just go back for a second look :)
---
My budget would just be PA frames with T51-b with all of the Paint jobs that I have.
---
Oh fuck that shit. I already bought the game for 80 bucks. Im good.
---
Sounds delicious.
---
Obviously what you are saying doesn't even make sense. If I am keep getting banned and coming back then how's it "getting over it"? You need to get over it and mind your business. 
---
Yeah it works for me!
---
I think if it ever went "free to play", there should be a reward for anyone who actually BOUGHT the game.. Like give us the DLC for free, but charge the F2P people? 
---
There should be a whole other game mode where the main story is a single player world and then there should be a downgraded pvp mode. I know thats a lot and will never happen with 76 because the game is already released. But i have played the game once and don‚Äôt plan on playing it again any time soon. Even if they released a really shitty single player mode without trophies or something it would be good. 
---
How about.... no?
---
Yeah but i got mods on this set i wear now 
---
I'm kinda looking forward to this day which is likely not that far off - at this point I'm just checking some boxes off the bucket list - collect all them plans, clothing items, and yes, still searching for that elusive perfect set of legendary weapons.  I probably have 1 more CAMP rebuild to do - want something with a great view for prime nukes.
---
Same here.   Whaaaat?
---
I despise them. I will only touch a missile launcher if I am right next to a workbench that I can scrap it, and that‚Äôs just for mods. I don‚Äôt know anybody who uses heavy weapons, so I can‚Äôt even sell the stuff...and at 3lbs apiece, I‚Äôm not carting a missile to a player hub.
---
My real life dogs recently moved in with my SO down in Georgia, and I am doglessly stuck in NC and I DEMAND DIGITAL DOGS.
---
agreed, we need some Chinese takeaway
---
You have both?
---
Thanks for sharing! I'm glad it got you through the quest. At least you found a sweet spot to set the CPU affinity if you need to
---
Simple: don't just look at the reviewers shitting on it. Look at the ones who give it a good review. Compare notes. Look at *why* they gave it the score they did. Ask friends if you can try it on their pc/ps4/xbox, ask around for a gameshare.... There are *plenty* ways you can try it without spending a single penny
---
I hear him all the time and I run out to see what the hell is going on, never find him
---
Okay.  I'm going to dedicate my time to outing you, /u/Kentas3000.  
---
I remember you.  You are an angry little shit.
---
Good job, you might have found 1 overpriced item out of 100. Your mommy must be proud of you.
---
Well then, just f*ck off, you cheater and robber.
---
If we are taking real life into the conversation then i'm pretty sure my house can store over 600lbs of stuff.
---
Uh EXCUSE you. He would never flee. He clearly chased his prey over there. His relentless dedication and bravery is admirable. 
---
On this sub, that location has completed many-a-missing leveled set pieces. Obviously it's level dependent, but it's been a really good luck spot.
---
This bug really needs fixing. Grief in PvP and PvE is getting out of hand 
---
I dropped supply req's a couple today both locked I looted and my mate couldn't after I did
---
2nd I unlocked and he looted and I could not after he did loot
---
You are honestly so stupid.
---
Like the amount of time you spend ripping people off, you could make more money at a minimum wage job you waste of space.
---
Tell your Dad I wish he pulled out faster.
---
It seems many want a shooter and not survival
---
The main story didn‚Äôt get good until the end and it was mediocre impacted to Vegas and Fallout 3.
---
Nocturnal at Night and Bloodied during the day?
---
Same, I have TSE rifles (Gauss/HM/La) but I have most fun when I use my good old reliable 1* medics LA.. I actually die less using it too üòâ
---
Do you even know what a robber means? You paid bethesda who robbed you with false advertisement and other malpractice methods. Meanwhile I am selling the product that everyone is familiar with. So stick your head out of the ass and turn on the brain.
---
To rise up the price or get internet famous? Interestingüßê
---
Bloodied is lower health, greater damage
---
Junkies is higher withdraw, greater damage
---
Instigating is more damage the longer you hit it (I think)
---
Executioners is more damage when you first hit it (I think)
---
Nocturnal is bad 50% of the time so unless it has some other epic perks, ditch it. Bloodied is the most OP melee legendary effect, but you have to make a build completely around just that weapon for full effect. Anti-armor is your best bet for general melee if you dont want to make a bloodied build.
---
fun trick: he spawns on roads near workshops! every time i go on a workshop capturing/defending spree, i'll see him at least once. 
---
Ive been saving all my stealth based legendary armors for a while now since hitting 50. (Level 89)
---
I keep em in case a legendary drops thats an upgrade but so i can play around with my loadout and STILL have chameleon.
---
If youre on ps4 i can give you one if you need.
---
You want it?
---
i'm level 139 I go there daily never seen them... just went there now no go.... to bad last 1 I need 
---
I hear a swop
---
My armor is dead
---
Looking for one, or a set? 
---
Meta
---
Sure if you‚Äôre giving it lol
---
Ah right. Dunno then sorry
---
Hrm well just double checked and it has changed a little. Current studies are saying 85 - 100. That's 68% of the u.s. there's another 15% that's 70 or lower and then there's 27% of people in the us that are 105+
---
I did find Dog Armor on some scorched dogs we killed during the queen fight. Wonder what that could be fore. It was in the armor section not junk. But it could just be something they carried over from 4 and didnt take out too.
---
I don't understand what you are getting at here? Short answer, you can't really form an unbiased opinion on it without playing it no. If you played the beta you have some actual content to base your opinion on, but if you havent played the game at all you're not supposed to form a strong opinion on it. Let people who have actually played it do that, and base your purchase (or not) on those opinions.
---
I'd take the axe tbh.
---
By the YouTube and article creator. People need to stop hating on the people that posted it to reddit wondering an official response or concerned consumers though. Some people were just legit concerned about it and got yelled at for asking questions about it and downvoted to oblivion.
---
15 luck here. Zero legendaries that haven‚Äôt gone right into a paper bag. 23 preserved pies. 
---
Oh yeah, you are absolutely /u/Kentas3000 (a reddit banned account).
---
You're still so angry and insulting to everybody.  Justifying your shitty behavior like a petulant child.
---
Well, I guess I'll just have to report you to the admins for circumventing a ban...
---
Angry? You are the angry one moaning on my posts among other salty unsuccessful people because I'm making a ton of cash and you just hate everything that reminds you how unsuccessful your are in comparison to others... Damn. You really don't have anything better to do in your miserable life? 
---
I don't let my personal enjoyment be affectef by what another person thinks... *as long as it is legal and guided by human morality.
---
Yeah why is my comment down voted so much
---
When are you available?
---
Sadly nothing  will ever compare to Fallout 3 üòû 
---
I got what I expected, so no Beth did not rob me. 
---
But you are the lowest scum of the gaming community. Get a job(if you are old enough).
---
Thanks mate! But Im on PC :-/
---
Gt KnowledgeHound medic/heavy gun user üëç happy to help whenever 
---
Hahahahahahaa
---
Repairs beyond 100% condition increases the damage and will constantly deteriorate as the weapon condition goes down back to 100%.
---
Hehe. But stuff. 
---
Walking in the hills of Appalachia puts a real strain on your calves. The protein is for them.
---
My pnn is boreas grd or boreas_grd look for me on top of whitesprings train station. 
---
Dang. Well best of luck to ya! Dont give up!
---
I've getting a lot of rifles latelty, actually. Which is good. And heavy guns. 
---
Ok I‚Äôm nalgachuey be right there
---
Just one for right now? 
---
Freudian slip
---
Yeah, an ice cream truck that is out of ice cream and only has vanilla frozen yogurt (which you already have 10 stacks of at home).
---
Two Shot, Quad flare gun would be so much fun. 
---
SO MANY FLARES!
---
Did not know that actually but good to know and I will see about making that change. My camp is slowly evolving over time but I‚Äôm keeping the basic principle the same regardless. Thanks for the tip. 
---
The fire one, right?
---
I frequent Harper's Ferry too (for the Excavator Calibrated Shocks), but haven't seen Handmade Plans ever there, maybe some NV Scope mods for it. Didn't you mistake it with the *Lever Gun* plans? I got my Handmade plans from the 26th Patrol Duty event (spanning over 2 weeks).
---
well with the new pvp server option there should be a pve option server for those who don't want to run around with pvp as a option 
---
This is the generation of the drama, the overreaction, the clickbait l33t YT videos, the entitlement, the tantrums. 
---
People are stupid not because of their age, but because they mimic what other stupid people are doing.
---
I'd settle for them letting us change the shape and size of our camps. These round camps make it really hard to arrange ourselves closer together. If we could make rectangles and shrink them as needed, then we could actually build up a little town.
---
Guess I haven't played the game then, okay.
---
Well the grognak axe at night is really op but is useful during the day and is weight is aroun 10
---
With all that luck, and you will still probably get a wooden armor piece from the SQB
---
Its about sneaking up to a super mutant as hes talking about how hes the strongest...
---
And one shotting him with a giant claw, riiiiight after he finishes that announcement.
---
I have my Excavator Armor frame and a T-60 Combat frame with camo paint on my person at all times. If you have an atom shop paintjob on even one piece of the armor, it adds a little symbol on the frame in your inventory.
---
What's your ign?
---
Do you have the t51b jetpack?
---
Propably because you assumed reality but only negatively, had you mentioned that people could store a million lbs in their stash then im sure you would be upvoted
---
Yes, considering also that the fire axe has a second star with limb damages
---
Possibly, though judging by your update in OP that's not the case.
---
I mean, there's a reason why people act like jackoffs when lazy questions like this are asked.  
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects  
---
It's been posted multiple times, a search either here or on google would have resulted with the link.  
---
Or create a "glitch" where some of those bobbleheads disappeared.
---
Ultracite should have a scorch-style paint with crossed-out Scorchbeast heads as a reward from killing the SBQ.
---
Edit: the weight is about 10 so i can't keep it with me for night use only
---
Thats not posible. Got quad +50% limb damage and it wont oneshot supermutants with 3.5x sneak.
---
I could do it with machete. But melee is not fun for me.

Said what? 
---
Pulling out must be in your whole family generation. Such a waste of human resources you are. 
---
Go cry in a corner now.
---
Instigating is more damage for an enemy with 100% HP.
---
Executioners is higher damage for enemies lower than ~40%? HP. 
---
I will shoot at everyone who isn‚Äôt nalgachuey
---
Makes me disappointed in humanity aswell. And these kids earn money by all the clout these suckers give them.
---
Wow, what an asshole. I'm just over 60 and I deliberately avoid getting near to a lot of low level players just because I don't want them to worry I'm a dick like that guy.
---
Ah ok. Do you mind if I edit your correction onto the original comment?
---
Honestly, I don't think BSG have the technical know-how to have perk cards apply to stashes.
---
Tin can traps are great for steel and lead too!
---
I want a dog! I‚Äôve done most of my game alone so far, don‚Äôt get me wrong I love teaming up, but it would have been good with a companion like dog meat. My bro said it must be a little like Mad Max, I said if I had a dog it would be more like I Am Legend.
---
Methinks a troll is afoot
---
You can do it anyway, just "re-crouch". There is perk for losing danger. (Not working on laggy servers)
---
I have this issue as well. Oddly, it‚Äôs with only one corner of my setup. I can‚Äôt put anything down on the foundation, so that corner of my porch is very empty.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Definitely leaning towards getting it.
---
I got one from a treasure map, probably the only decent thing I have found from the treasure maps. 
---
Ehh, after reading this me and a few friends tried to test it out (on PS4, all of us between levels 100 and 170). We're at a combined 160 server hops and have had nothing pop up.  
---
Sent request so I can join u
---
r/fuckkaren
---
No I can craft it
---
Had someone say this exact same shit to me yesterday over a different issue lol. The presumption and self importance is staggering.
---
Every perk that you have acquired that is. I think that is the intention no? You can use every perk just not all at the same time. With your version eventully yiu would have all perks active at the same time.
---
So how'd it go?
---
How much to craft one or can i just bring you the mats
---
It started to harass a woman, yes. 
---
Id get rid of nocturnal first, too bad grognaks axe looks the coolest.
---
Im doing a high rad build, which works perfectly with bloodied. If you dont want to run around with 30% health, id go with the anti armor.
---
Does the bloody sledge have any additional modifiers?
---
You said the fireaxe also has limb damage?
---
This would be fun! :O
---
I'd take set at the right price
---
This is true. I'm just trying to give a location where nobody can beat you to it, guaranteed to get lead and steel every single time, without fail. And that is where excavating comes in. 
---
Why do you think they named him Phoenix...  I mean sometimes he does lose but then he always comes back :-p
---
Well I would be okay with it if we would have some sort of replacement. 
---
Yes, true in other MMOs you have "a" weapon being nerfed. But I never saw an entire tier of weapons, imho the endgame tier of weapons, being so brutally reduced.
---
If he's anything like my sisters, you need to go in with a rope tied to you and fastened to a fixture outside the room.
---
Yes 
---
Scotch Scotch Scotch I Love Scotch 
---
First time I saw grahm I thought he was a player
---
Stop encouraging them to add more fruit hats to the atom shop
---
Go for it. 
---
Furious is the increasing damage per hit. 
---
You would only have active the perks you SPECIAL score allow you to use. Never all of them. 
---
Yes, the fire axe is the only with 2 stars
---
First world apocalypse problems- do we want that nuclear generator, jukebox, racecar bed, shower, and commie poster? Or do we want that extra turret?
---
Oh yeah. I totally funnel all my illegal money into atoms and TSES
---
You know, rather than using a Business to layer and wash my money to turn it from evil crime money into "perfectly fine, taxed by inland revenue"
---
14 luck and i get shit of the shits shits.  
---
&gt;  dig through the game files and take a look, see if I could figure it out myself... and was not disappointed
---
If I understand the implication correctly, is it the client which rolls for the mod and notifies the server about the outcome? Or is it that the client has this data defunct, but the server could actually run with a different loot-chance table?
---
I finally finished this quest the other day. I needed to find 5 and found them all within 5 minutes. I‚Äôm level 148 so they can be found at high levels.
---
My emotes in game are not working lmao I wanted to say thanks haha
---
I wish I had a dog to stick around my camp and kill the critters that attack in the blind spot of my turret.
---
There is a dog in the game, in the mire up on a cliff, sitting next to his dead owners (dammit ol yeller, dont you make me cry now). I dont have the taming perk, so I havent tried to see if you can tame it.
---
Oh. Right. That makes sense. I think I'm getting old. 
---
Meta-er 
---
I‚Äôm late to drop off my son and work, let me know if you want caps for it 
---
So yeah must be a bug, kept shooting it with a TSE gatling and TSE pump and i was like hmm something isnt right
---
Half of my queen kills are like that. The only toon I can reliably tag the SBQ for credit on is my heavy weapons. Even on that toon with a bloodied gatling doing ~240 damage a shot, I have still failed to get credit.
---
I'd rather have the 15+ straight jackets.  Sell them after popping a grape mentat and you can easily afford to buy bulk fiber if you have to.
---
Word
---
Nah, just watched waaaaaay too many "true crime" documentaries this week :p
---
I'm level 38, just play casually and solo, a few weeks back all I could find there were lvl 60's charred and glowing ones now I get all 15-22 ghouls, spent an hour running around the course last night killing as many as I could before I said screw it and went to the blackwater mine...must've killed 100+ ghouls, not...one...single...golfer
---
It's definitely possible even with a standard hunting rifle. I regularly sneak around West Tek Research Centre one-shotting them all. Adrenal reaction, bloody mess, etc all help.
---
I have always been able to find a clown outfit and hat at Freddy's house of fear. And there is always a windango in the windango cave
---
That would be broken and unbalanced, but I do like the idea of hitting multiple enemies.
---
&gt; Bethesda, can you please remove the ability to stack ~~explosive~~ bobbleheads on the next patch?
---
So you expected a pile of crap game and you bought it? Well you just showed everyone what a tool you are. Gj.
---
Shiitt.. looks like I dont even need a job. But you on the other hand might want to start flipping those burgers a bit faster to compensate for the intellect you dont have.
---
I had something similar happen.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aihdib/epic_30_minute_battle_with_grahm_the_merchant/eenwhzy/
---
Using 10,000 bobbleheads is an effective impossiblity due to their rarity. The only reason this is possible is due to duping. Let's not nerf a good mechanic because an exploit exists. 
---
Roofing definitely leaves something to be desired in general 
---
You have to bring me the Mats and I charge 500 caps for crafting it...if I provide the materials it would be 2000 caps.
---
Higher price the more charisma you have, and certain chems, food, bobbleheads,perks will also increase the trading prices. 
---
Not met him either ‡ºº ‡ºé‡∫∂ ‡∑¥ ‡ºé‡∫∂‡ºΩ
---
I love my anti-armor fire axe, reliable and easy to repair.
---
Your name makes this post so much better. And yes I'd love a mutant hound by my side üëç
---
Mia culpa. I misspoke. I sold the missile launcher to a vendor but the missiles themselves went into the blue suitcase outside the Charleston train station.
---
Nope, that's dumb. Play something else.
---
Ah, if the sledge had power attack or swing speed, id definitely go with that, those make the slow weapons so much better.
---
I havent really noticed any affect from the bonus limb damage, but I dont use vats, so no telling where im actually connecting with my hits. 
---
They are chasing YouTube money. Nothing more. Controversy = pennies. Manufacturered controversy is necessary for the $ to flow in.
---
Agreed. I think people are twisting their panties too much and all it does is create more negativity amongst the community. The "youtubers" will be themselves, no matter what the community does, and we shouldn't let their opinions; whether they are right or wrong, take control of us.
---
I'm perfectly fine on the videos out there. Is a lot of it negative? Maybe? I mean I guess it boils down to how well people can take criticism. I am enjoying this game, but I definitely can see where the content creators are coming from. There are bugs galore, overly expensive cosmetics, duping, etc. Rather than take it as something negative, look at the positive. Bugs are getting fixed, dupers are getting banned and Bethesda is responding to the community. Keeping a developer under the burning spotlight isn't necessarily a bad thing.
---
Take for example the F2P rumor. Sure a nasty little rumor but guess what we got in return? An official response from Bethesda. Isn't it good that we have a response from the company to quell the fears of others?
---
A companion would be lovely, just for a little company tbh.
---
I feel like a default Mr. Handy or Mr. Gutsy wouldn't be too OP in a fight, and their idle dialogue is funny as hell!
---
I just hope they're essential. I get attached easily lmao
---
One hell of a wall of text to say "i agree"
---
Thats why I make my roofs even
---
You have to do "dropped connections" event, you'll find money in the space casket
---
u/justmashedpotatoes
---
Its really unfortunate that they are removing everything you can do to benefit other players, like Feed The People‚Äôs original benefits and now this... kind of takes away from ‚Äúrebuild Appalachia!‚Äù and ‚Äúplay as a team!‚Äù
---
I finished all other main quests at level 24, now I am grinding to level 50 to do "I am become Death", currently at 47.
---
No...
---
Yeah I have this same problem with my marine armor
---
I know, right?  It's my best idea since I came up with the mutation that gives you a really big butt and does nothing else.
---
Thanks again, that does seem to bee the case, moving the mats updates a list or something. I'm presuming these *lists* are kept and maintained on the server so this problem may be network lag related or the server is struggling to keep up with the millions of transactions.
---
Bethesda could do worse than head hunt some talent from Eve Online or some such MMO to help configure the servers.
---
Esc, Z. Should be a category called challenges. You get daily, weekly and lifetime 
---
Some bash.  Some play it. Honestly, you can find whatever you are looking for. Ive used it for building tips. I don‚Äôt want someone to tell me how to play ( or cheat). 
---
A 30 second sbq fight is possible legit hell a 3 hit is possible legit with the perfect build but a 10 shots very viable counting only when she first lands as fight start
---
Hahaha "challenge", nice one :)
---
It's not even that good, lol.
---
funny i feel like the 'hate train' is entirely from the anti pvp faction of this sub, which is why this sub is dieing to the filthy casuals sub
---
This would be great so I can finally have an explosive weapon
---
Don't play online games then.  Dying is part of it, softie. 
---
Fair point!  As soon as the stash size is as realistic as how much I can store in my real life house, this will no longer be an issue.
---
This is the biggest no I‚Äôve ever heard. You wanna craft legendaries? Go play 4 with mods, you‚Äôll see very soon how wrong this is
---
Basically, vendors are like pawn brokers. They're only going to give you 1/10 the value of your item. You can increase it with higher Charisma, Grape Mentats, and the Hard Bargain perk.
---
The real way to make money if you get a decent 3* legendary is to go on the player markets and advertise.
---
Yes...
---
Ah my weightless grognak ax‚Äôs with 40% swing speed 
---
I‚Äôll feel like a Jedi with this shit.
---
I doubt that's happened anyway as gameflip has buyer protection. If he hasn't received the item within 3 days or something he gets his money back.
---
I'll have to check Freddy's when I get home, another Reddit post said the fairgrounds by v76 but I've yet to find it there
---
Oh, goody.  I get to report ***THIS*** alternate account as well.
---
I dont get why people pay there way through a game...sure getting cool stuff from Atom shop is fun once in a while..like a piant Mod, but buying a rare gun?? not me.  It ruins the fun of working for it.  yesterday, I finally got a good one. 2 TS  Gauss rifle with %50 limb damage and +33% VATS accuracy.  280 dmg. With speed demon, it reloads fast.
---
My perks for rifles add to the damage.  Preeeety Sweeet. if anyone wants to make fun of that...go ahead, but I earned it! (it was a 3\* Sentry Bot out by the train-yard in Watoga). That had to be the hardest thing ive killed in this game next to the SBC. This thing was dropping bombs on me along with lasers.  went through all my stims and lost my junk which was a lot, but worth it.
---
I've been toying with something like this... just never have a chance because everytime I run into people it's in a firefight
---
I am never NOT suffering from rad worms.
---
It isn't entirely black and white, very true.  But carry capacity right now just isn't even a distant acquaintance with realism.
---
Imagine how broken and unbalanced this would be? All you have to do is grind legendaries for about a hour and scrap them all, then you have basically every legendary effect, it would just be broken and unbalanced being able to make the best armor....
---
Hmm, so say my friend that I always play games with, sees a negative review and refuses to try a game.  How does one get to choose how it affects them in that situation? :) Just playing devil's/common sense advocate lol
---
I know a chick who sold bags of her poop to a dude, panties were included. No lie.
---
I usually go with my bloodied sledge myself added the heated coil I love it I wish I got a better roll like added str but it is pretty awesome but a fire axe degrades slower if I remember right 
---
Here‚Äôs a fairly full explanation of the use of blackberries.  I get much less expensive damage with a perimeter of blackberry plants and punji boards...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/aaldal/blackberry_defense_systems_the_budget_friendly/?st=&amp;sh=
---
I hope Bethesda adds a tower defense PvP mode
---
rotate the flat central roof piece?
---
Pointing out bullshit is a noble thing to do.
---
They have a door with a keypad? So like, your entire house becomes a lock box?
---
You cant however i built my camp there and he comes inside :)
---
Their tails crack me up.
---
I think it's just because he didn't do the quest to get the other bots to turn neutral to him.
---
maybe because you have too high self-esteem?
---
True true. Though it would be alot more perks active at the same time right?
---
Yes, i agree so much with that Haha 
---
Just bought call of duty so I'm good
---
Thanks, but I am in Xbox.
---
I see the occasional thing pop up and give me atoms. Yesterday in fact I got it for flowers which seem to be broken butt I got is for picking flowers and for killing a scorched I believe. I wondered where I could find it 
---
I am going to search for it. Thanks again 
---
I can't help but wonder what he did with it.
---
Can your amoeba sized brain comprehend that it takes 10 seconds to create an alt account?
---
:DDD
---
It's great to see that there are players who look forward to the pvp mode/servers. I don't mean it in a sarcastic way because I prefer coop over pvp content. I mean that it's a constructive change that's supposed to ease the tensions between players who enjoy pvp and those who don't. To make the game more enjoyable for all players. 
---
Feel free to add me if you‚Äôd like, I‚Äôm the same exact way as you. I play solo 24/7 but wouldn‚Äôt mind being on a team just for the benefits. My GT is Tinzlo.
---
*proceeds to shotgun muties legs with maxed enforcer
---
I think being to add *one* legendary effect to a piece would be more fair.
---
And limiting it only to a few effects
---
I don‚Äôt think being able to create a three star TSE would be a good idea though.
---
So, you admit that you are creating alt accounts after your primary being banned?
---
Nope, haven't seen them
---
That's the best description.
---
Ahhhh ok. I've been leaving doggie bags of ammo (and tons of other stuff) in front of vendors or in the whitesprings hallway in hopes that someone can use it. I think if it goes in a container random loot will respawn and delete it pretty quickly. 
---
Honestly, the stash limit combined with the vendor caps limit is leading to some pretty crazy unintended consequences.  I acquired an entire set of Excavation PA because someone dumped it at whitesprings.  I've left an entire set of T60 plus some x01 in the same area in addition to lengendaries, ammo, chems etc. I bought a 3star legendary off someone for 30 caps. 
---
We have to hoard junk to build and repair, so we end up giving or throwing away the most valuable stuff in the game! Loose screws instead of X01? This is stupid.
---
Facts don't care about your feelings.
---
Just because you've played games for 20 years doesn't make your opinion any more valid, and nobody cares nor asked.
---
" but forcing everyone to pvp is foolish and it will turn people away."
---
How is PVP forced upon everyone? There is a passive mode feature for people who wish to not engage in PVP. And there we go again with the generalising and assumptions that because you don't like it, nobody else should.
---
" What u find pathetic is your inability to contribute to a conversation without resorting to school yard insults."
---
You don't want a discussion, only for people to agree with you. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, buddy, but how did I resort to "school yard insults"?
---
" I've mentioned plenty of alternatives, and I am willing to have a discussion on the topic at hand."
---
Are you trying to convince yourself or me of that? You haven't mentioned anything other than disabling PVP and making legendary weapons worthless because you don't like it.
---
"  I don't enjoy the game in it's current state."
---
If you don't enjoy the game in its current state, don't play it.
---
" The game can be balanced"
---
No, it can't. Never can be unless everyone has exactly the same items.
---
PVP is not "only fun for griefers"... Plenty of people engage in PVP for fun, and anyone who does is a griefer in your eyes?
---
Not that there's anything wrong with griefing, but this isn't what the discussion was about.
---
Jesus Christ that hurt to read...
---
Yes and no. I typically like to have PvP in a game, even if I don't partake, just to know it's there. But in this particular game, I feel the balance and combat mechanics are still in an absolutely atrocious state. So throwing hardcore PvP mode on top of that dumpster fire won't smell good. 
---
Can I have a fox instead?
---
Huh, courier font and a few more commas, and it would be satisfactory
---
Yeah interested in the answer for this to! Found it weird tried about 5 times before realising something was wrong üòÇ
---
&gt; when there is pretty much no other games that allow you to earn the in-game currency as fast with challenges.
---
Not sure I agree with that at all, at least after level 50.
---
 He always seems extra salty because he's never invited to events that other "influencers" are. 
---
I'd change it to scrap Legendary weapons/armor to learn recipe. Need boat load of flux, other endgame stuff, a character level, and a sacrificial maxed out perk card to make. I.e to make junk lighter you have to sacrifice maxed out Pack Rat.
---
Cool, now I just need a pile of stable flush to build the darn thing
---
Nocturnal is always the best option. Ppl play these stupid Bloodied Swing Speeds cuz they're poor.
---
Well, I said I agreed in the second sentence. The rest was for the sake of friendly conversation. 
---
Any luck finding "Graham's stash"? A few people insist it's still a legitimate rare find. Never seen anything validating that though. 
---
Yeah. On the one hand I do feel like it behaves a little better than it did in 4 - I feel like the pieces maybe fit together better (or it's the same, and my memory is bad enough for me too forget I learned how to use them but good enough that I actually retained the skill) but on the other hand the very limited "palette" really kind of takes away some of the flavor one could add with the proper sorts of roofing.
---
indeed, but my ocd needs to carry too much crap so i need that extra 100lb carry weight
---
I think you misunderstood me. I was in your shoes, someone told me that this wasn't the game for me.
---
If the pic is real, it‚Äôs pretty good. 
---
Sorry, I'm afraid apparently the only correct way to enjoy the game is OPs
---
Welcome to r/showerthoughts
---
Not if done right, let say breaking down legendaries would give a special crafting material that comes in several tiers. Like, say one tier per star of the broken down item. Then you would need a bunch to craft the effect you want.
---
RNG loot drops where a bear can drop an explosive harpoon gun and server hopping to farm legendaries is what is unbalanced. Stupid, grindy, nonsense that rewards dumb luck and wasting my time.
---
Agreed, at the very least a good chunk of Fo4s settlement items should be in game. Even if you unlock every plan in Fo76, CAMPs can be very bare and boring and the selection feels very bare. 
---
Who killed my Dogmeat?!
---
Isn't knight paint from the dev's room?
---
A lot of people are disagreeing with your point.
---
More perk cards would be active for sure, it's kind of the whole point of the actual discussion about decks, passive/active perks and all that.
---
Balance would mainly depends which SPECIAL prerequisite is defined for each perk cards.
---
I never asked 
---
Keep playing until her slippers shuffling across the carpet sound like SB wings...
---
If you're on Xbox ill outfit you with better gear and show you the best areas
---
This is annoying considering the loading screen tip says that even without any plates power armor offers many benefits such as immune to fall damage and increased carry weight. No sense carrying 10lb useless crap ass armor if you can use that space for junk and healing items. You don't need that extra protection since game is bugged anyways and doesn't even count that. LVL 50 mr. gutsy shoots you twice and you are dead, with or without power armor. And without it, like I have, special armor is useful, invisibility and increased carryweight, auto healing and increased damage and energy resistance...
---
Why not?
---
Getting those special legendaries are supposed to be a grind, you aren't supposed to be able to craft the best weapons and armor with all your desired effects, the grind to get those special weapons is the gameplay loop Bethesda made to keep you playing the game
---
What about PvP areas.  I played an mmo where there was a specific area of a map where if you entered it warned you that it would make you eligible for PvP.  That way people who want to PvP will go and jump in and those who do not just avoid entering the area.
---
I'm thinking ARK / Rust, not mindless kill &amp; respawn.
---
I noticed it‚Äôs been a problem for returning players and Christmas noobs. Played since beta too, didn‚Äôt have that problem because we were all starting at lower levels. 
---
I would settle for Recalibration, like The Divison did. Basically you take a weapon you like, but which isn't perfect. And the recalibration station allows you to pick one talent/perk/bonus on the item, and reroll it from the available pool. It cost something to reroll each time, and you could only change one thing, so you still needed to do a LOT of farming to find the mostly-good item. But it allowed you take a mostly-good item and turn it into perfect item.
---
I must agree with you - I played F4 without any mods the whole time to get all achievements on PS4. After that I've installed mods, spend some time to modify all my stuff to legendary and... lost interest in the game within a day. There will be no more purpose to play if you can craft godly rolled weapons/armor, even if it'll take some time to gather necessary materials.
---
I don't get your point
---
IKR! haha.
---
About Patrol Duty, that's true, but I tried to get the event last night and had no success, no event was prompted the time I reached the place, was out of time so couldn't jump servers, but today I'll try again, seems easier than find Grahm LOL.
---
Dogs and cats would be among the first things to go when the food runs low... it would take time for their number to grow enough to be prevalent in a post apocalyptic world... if we had dogs and cats, wouldn‚Äôt you think they would have had cows, chickens, horses, goats, and other domesticated animals in the vaults for when they needed to restart the world?
---
On a side note I‚Äôd love to have goats in the game, something that come by and ears all the tin cans and spoiled food that I drop.
---
Awesome! Can I repost this on my Fallout C.A.M.P.s Instagram? (with credit to you of course) The account is fallout.camps. 
---
I am currently weaning myself off of weight reduction cards for casual play (except bear arms). It does work without them at all levels for my characters. For special occasions - ammo runs etc - you can pick them up again. Having them as a backup also helps when you find that unexpected gem that pushes you over the fast travel limit. 
---
Admittedly if I would keep a full set of 1-2 of each weapon type on one character to switch setups around it would be impossible with the current stash limit.
---
I think weapons, Armor and certain energy/explosive ammo should be compressed by a solid factor in the stash. 
---
Pretty good to show off in trade channel, other than that - eh.
---
Or.... quests, meanful content, raids, worthwhile pvp ....
---
I would like that. It could be somewhere like the Ash Heap or Cranberry Bog out of the way.
---
I thought I've seen somewhere that he also could be selling it, I guess Patrol Duty it is then...
---
Perhaps this balances out if there is a small chance to create a one time use mod instead of being able to craft it idefinately. It would certainly give one star loot a purpose other than vendor trash. 
---
Dont you go in debt when you die as wanted with no caps in your inventory?
---
Or scrap the whole legendary armor\weapon
---
And just allow legendary mods to drop
---
100% agreed
---
yea im sure
---
This is true. Every prime fissure I nuke, I guarantee there‚Äôs at least three level 20-50 players beating the queen with a pool noodle while I‚Äôm 136 mowing down adds so I can get clean shots off on her. It‚Äôs bullshit. Bring some real value to the fight or get lost because you‚Äôre ruining it for everyone else. 
---
I've had the bag not even show up
---
If they made pacifist mode that extreme, I probably wouldn't play.
---
Well then I would absolutely love to see those videos you're talking about. Please share some links.
---
Otherwise, yeah it was the SBQ.
---
You get a -50% damage reduction to other players but when you‚Äôre stacking bobble heads and you have explosive weapons. You can easily do over 15k damage and one shot a scorchbeast queen.
---
oh, ok, so I misunderstand you...
---
Quests can yeild you legendaries, there is no point to be able to craft legendaries, imagine how boring it would be able to craft a legendary with the best effects in the fuckin game.
---
It would appear that some of the rolls are just bad. If you inspect +Rad Resist items, you'll see that the non-bugged items will display the 25 radiation resistance below the DR/ER numbers in the DMG Resist box, whereas bugged armor will display either 0 or nothing, as if the legendary effect was never applied. There's no fix, as far as I know, but at least you can quickly check if trading with others.
---
Heard of it but never had that problem. I accidentally scrapped weapons I liked until all I had were legendaries, no issues with scrapping after that.
---
Got the guide myself. There is a code to the online part so with any luck after every update its gets updated as well. Said it will be kept up to date. Should really log in and see. 
---
I would rather them be scrapable
---
There would be multiple types of servers. Besides, how is someone else‚Äôs decision to play the game affecting you in any type of way?
---
Yup this happened to me as well quite frustrating!
---
Ahh damn. This was a furious explosive lever action. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever see such a gun again.
---
This is a fucking joke, honestly.
---
You dont need any materials to install if you bought the mod
---
Everyone knew this long time ago, you dork. :D
---
That don't work to fill the gap. 
---
Its the same, 1 pount in a weapon card for 10, 2 in  loody mess and its still 20%.  Also, why put three points into one card for 20% instead of three one point weapon cards for 30%?  At any rate my point was the second and third point in each weapon card give 5%.
---
Bloody mess is a multiplier off the adjusted damage and not base weapon damage like the weapon cards.  I'd recommend doing a search on the sub, was a couple good posts that got down into the math comparisons if you care that far.
---
Right exactly.  Gives those who want it or don‚Äôt want it a choice.  If you‚Äôre not in that area then you can‚Äôt destroy someone‚Äôs CAMP or mess with them for PvP. 
---
Thanks, this is all I needed for my admin report.
---
the mid-20s is the part of the game where every solo player seems to get stuck at, i had the exact same problem until at around level 26-28 i found a really nice group who helped me level up and i still run with the same people over a month later, at level 110+. i would guess that the fastest way to get past the worst part is to try to find a group that you can level up with, after level 40 it‚Äôll get *a lot* easier
---
I run traveling pharmaxy because i sell aid items to vendors and true hiker because i love off of purified canned waster, ionized meat and raw meat. (Carnivore mutation) i notice sprinting ate a a lot of my thirst and hunger. Even more that I a speed demon. I usuallay jus do walk/ run and that makes of
---
 more bearable
---
Good for you. Others might not get so lucky. 
---
if i see them on IG again ill send u the links 
---
And this is why i fully expect Jeremy/Thequartering's new "politics free gaming" website to an absolute garbage fire of narcissism and echo chambering
---
Since they changed the mechanics with the last patch, I have, however, come across some supply drops that are not locked where I can just take the loot without stealing and some that are locked.  If the owner of the drop picks the lock first, does it remain open for other players?
---
Simon Leis would like a word with YOU.
---
Maybe that's why they're pulling it from the shelves?  Because there's nothing in the box?
---
I will wait, probably forever since this isn't a thing.
---
He's around the Overseer's camp from time to time.
---
Sorry for your loss mate
---
Does the game become about the crazy powerful weapons? Was with high level players who only used this crazy laser mini gun and sledgehammer thing that killed high levels in seconds. I'd hate to give up the more grounded guns like rifles and shotguns for those other weapons just to play the game.
---
It would mean more to me than getting it randomly from radroach #74382
---
It's a new bug.
---
I don't even understand how some bobbleheads could stack when others couldn't.  Is there some variable that Bethesda just forgot to set on some of them?  
---
The only way that is workable is if you can set it on the home screen before joining a server.
---
Otherwise I can abuse TF out of it. Destroy your base and kill you loads. They go pacifist after my friend clears my bounty.
---
Source: over 1000 hours in GTAO with passive mode.
---
Second day in a row i got pvp flagged while helping on an event at a workshop area. At first i was repairing turrets cause there was a scorch beast flying around, so it was helping. All of a sudden turrets started to fire on me and realized i was flagged. I checked my settings to make sure my passive mode was on and it wasn't. Not sure when this was flipped but it sucks that if any dmg is done to the workshop items while helping in an event flags you. I don't like the sensitivity of this. I mean if I'm all out destroying someone thats one thing but helping in an event is BS.
---
Gamer youtubers rarely have any actual clue wtf theyre talking about. They think that high sib and view count means the OPINION they have is fact.
---
I have experienced this to some degree. I think the challenge is that we (or at least I) am used to playing games where you progress through areas gaining experience and the enemies progressively get harder.  My impression is that this game would do that, but because high level player often cause high level enemies to spawn, you suddenly find yourself mobbed by enemies 20 levels above you and the experience becomes less enjoyable. There are quests that you should be able to complete at lower levels that you cannot because high level characters frequent certain areas. 
---
I received advice that 1) the 20s are hard in this game and feel like a grind and 2) if you play solo, upping your stealth and using long range weapons to systematically pick off enemies helps. I agree with both. 
---
Apologies if it seemed as if I was defending myself from you, nothing like that. I guess if weight and amount of items does affect the stability of the server, then I don't really want to push this topic further, since it's not a tantrum, but rather a though that perhaps could be shared by other people as well. Also, like you said, sometimes you have to adjust to what was intended to be from the very beginning, may be developers saw this as another obstacle that player has to overcome, just like having to eat food and drink water all the time.
---
I think I'm at the right house.  I looked a few times but only found a magazine, I wonder if it randomly spawns there.  I'm going to keep trying (also great spot to farm lol). I might take some screenshots of these now to help others
---
You should be going more into the Toxic Valley north of Forest at that level and a little into Divide.  The problem is the level scaling so if a high level is in the area (possibly recently but since left?) it‚Äôs going to make it tougher.  Pretty sure Toxic Valley, like the Forest, has a lower max level spawn.
---
That‚Äôs what youtubers are saying but I found this interesting.  https://mobile.twitter.com/bethesda/status/1087775312849571841?s=19
---
Not sure if this is verified or not.  Either way I like the game so I‚Äôll keep playing. 
---
I am only level 30 and I am just wandering alone. Loving it.  Trying to really feel as if I am in a wastelenad.
---
Remember when in the movie "I am legend" will Smith crossed out the houses he visited to know he checked those for supplies?
---
I and long the same. I have a map with all the locations and even the unnamed stuff, like a "biplane crash site" or a "cultist totem". 
---
There are a bout 60 per region and I am checking them all having tons of fun. Yesterday I discovered "games of thrones" which are two skeletons in a toilet with guns. 
---
If I get bored I do a mission. 
---
So what? You aren't getting my point, it would be broken and unbalanced to be able to craft the best weapons and armor with the best legendary effects 
---
Aww man, I'm 5 days late for the argument between guys refusing to admit their preferred play styles might be unbalanced. 
---
I have a freakin pile of shotgun shells and 10mm. Not sure about .44, but probably have a bunch of that as well. Would love to swap it for some .308 ammo. Im usually on in the evenings after work if you're interested.
---
That's not a bad alternative.
---
Yep its not working. Ever since the last patch (PS4).  My C.A.M.P. is very close to it. Use to grind it daily for plastic, cement bags and some other goodies. I have raised a ticket with Bethesda. 
---
Ok thanx dick lips
---
He was fighting the ghouls? Last weekend he was in a Morgan Town nuke zone and he walked right by a bunch of ghouls. They all ignored him. 
---
Of course, everyone stopped and traded him. There was a line of players waiting. Free radiation while you wait! 
---
Snap a few screen shots. I always wanted to try this with friends 
---
Burning time to RNG drops or time to farm materials, i'd prefer to farm because it gives me back some measure of control of my character's progress.
---
As somebody who built a dog sanctuary in Fallout 4 (https://imgur.com/n5nw5n2), am all for that suggestion! But if they ever did please, please have a beagle skin!!! 
---
The picture is just not enough! https://imgur.com/iKPtblP
---
BTW for other dog crazy people! We in the Merseyside Beagle Club have just broken the record for The Largest Single Breed Walk! The video on Guinness page is mine of the walk. http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-dog-walk-(single-breed)
---
There is no talking to you no life wankers, your time must be worth your minimum wage employment.
---
Then just let your friend be gullible and easily swayed. Part of being a mature human being is learning ‚Äúyou be you.‚Äù Just play what you enjoy and that‚Äôs all that matters. *That‚Äôs* common sense. 
---
Then there should be an option to just turn it on at the main menu.
---
Could always just take the perk that bars you from getting sick instead of the reduction. There's always food! Or take Good Boy and Cola Nut! 
---
I am convinced most of the high profile hate is being manufactured and funded by Bethesda‚Äôs competition.    Seriously.  
---
That, and clickbait funding models.
---
My dad never played video games ever 
---
Since our supply drops were unlocked, I believe that the containers remain open regardless of who picked them. The only difference is that the player who called them in doesn't get a bounty.
---
As for the unlocked drops: Those might have been spawned in by a random encounter. Usually there's a crashed drone nearby. Chances are that these random encounters work differently from regular supply drops. 
---
Me too 
---
I wish Carry weight was tied to level and not stats/perks. If you‚Äôre level 125 you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about mundane bullshit anymore; you should be able to explore the other perk cards and builds to see what the game has to offer. 
---
Sounds like a dupe destroyer program. I've only heard of this recently.. Same this g used to happen. When Diablo did the rust thing.. As in any dropped dupe item detected is immediately deleted.. 
---
Or it simply could have been server lag ? Ps4 servers have trash lately.
---
Exactly, the whole system is flawed. 
---
do you really believe fallout 76 is a great game? i mean really deep down do you REALLY think so? and if yes i'd love to know some other great games that you could recommend. 
---
the game is trash, objectively its a piece of junk. its basically a meme at this point and easily the worst disaster of a game to come out in 5 or more years in my opinion.
---
I'd love to know how a youtuber telling people his own opinions about a game diminishes from the experience, I've watched movies with bad reviews that I've enjoyed before. never once have i watched a movie and been angry that the reviewer ruined my film-going experience.
---
I did... I was low on meat. 
---
I‚Äôm on xbox, and have never heard or seen anyone with this gun.
---
Anyone had the energy to shove this in the face of the main negitive f76 fake news spreaders on youtube, reddit and so on?
---
I posted about this last night.  Seeing the same thing - the +25 radiation resist doesn't seem to show up after its equipped.
---
You are probably right. This idea was brought up by few more gentlemen here as well, so I guess I overlooked it as an additional limitation/obstacle. It should still be treated as an intended limit. But why didn't they explain this when they were approached about the stash size? Why not just tell us that it's "by design"? They went through troubles of trying to explain the lack of additional size by some server instability issues.. that's what makes me wonder if it really was intended to be just another obstacle.
---
wish rust was on consoles, ark and conan exiles are the only real other options.  i was under the impression fallout 76 would be much more like those games than it currently is.  fallout 76 is the easiest survival game ive ever heard of, its really hard to die. 
---
You don't have a point. A properly done crafting system could make creating a best-in-slot item hours worth of meanfuling content instead of grindy dumb nonsense like we have now. 
---
As to broken and unbalanced, it is only broken if that case if it is already broken now (which I might agree with you on certain legendary combos) and unbalanced hardly applies in a situation where items can be freely traded and currently the best gear hands down ... is on duper accounts.
---
Are keep still saying this? FFS it came from a person that made a post about it *to show how people spread BS about this game*. They've absolutely proved their point. Even though they posted later saying this, YouTubers and websites are still pushing it for clicks and views.m because that's their business.
---
This shows how often people trade in genuine news or accuracy for money. Lying is better business than the truth.
---
Ahh, okay. wasn't sure if it was just me. but since there's a ticket I'll let it be for now.
---
I just ran up to one, hit E for the "make friends" option and then booked it out of there. I also had super mutants in the area that attacked it so the maib attacks were drawn away from me. Good luck friend!
---
Your lucky, at level 117, I still haven‚Äôt gotten any explosive weapons.
---
waste of time
---
Every time I see Graham I almost start shooting before I realise it's him. Due to the loneliness in this game, or the fact that I've lost my grip on reality, I often find myself talking back to Graham, especially when he tells me of his love for Cholley Moo-moo and tells those moving anecdotes about his friend and mentor, Smartie, who I know must have passed on to that place where all good and wise Super Mutants go. ;'{
---
I didn't leave the forest/ash heap until I was pushing level 40.  And I encourage you to resist the urge and offers from others to speed run across the map.  This game is all about the journey, not the destination (which atm is mostly just grinding legendaries so you can grind SBQ so you can grind more legendaries).
---
Ever notice how he, some lowlife who got banned from Wizards of the Coast events because of his campaign of harassment against a female cosplayer, seems to have "sources" in every major facet of the games industry?
---
I told him to souce his claims on youtube and Twitter a while back. got some abuse for being a "woke SJW" and my YT comment deleted
---
Typical internet famous cunt really
---
If you haven't sold them already I'll take them.
---
I also don't see much 76 content anymore
---
*Insert JP lobster joke here*
---
Yeah i was kinda wtf as well
---
Yeah, there's some in-game screenshots of it as well.
---
The popluation diminished a lot since dupers have started being hit with the ban wave.
---
I feel you, honestly. It takes a very long time to grind for such weapons, and it‚Äôs a shame that they can vanish without warning.
---
It seems the more i walk/run with close to max or over carrying weight the quicker i go through water and food. I am sure this is all my design. I think things would hold true if you were walking around all day carrying 100 or 200 lbs more!! the more I play, i am getting the hang of things - staying lean i guess which is a big change for me coming from FO4 in which i hoarded everything.
---
This is what I get for giving this shitty game and Bethesda a chance. Bethesda fucked us over.
---
I'm solo and never had any problems..
---
Im not selling anything I want to buy them.
---
Everyone downvoting this post probably have already spent a lot of time farming legendaries and are falling into a sunk cost fallacy. The legendary system is less than ideal and I think we should encourage discussions on how to improve it. Simply saying "no" is not helping anything. Please leave some input.
---
Personally, I've been ruminating over a similar system as OP proposed and I'm glad to see someone finally articulated it. We all have finite time to play the game. There should be a system that rewards the time spent grinding instead of leaving it up to chance. This system could be a way to fix that.
---
well the really big butt could do some area damage - like reducing perception from others by 5 ;)
---
The game developers said, you can play solo and that anyone could come up to you and best you to death if they wanted?  Do you some kind of cognitive issue that doesn't see how absolutely contradictory that is?
---
&gt; Its the same, 1 pount in a weapon card for 10, 2 in loody mess and its still 20%. Also, why put three points into one card for 20% instead of three one point weapon cards for 30%? At any rate my point was the second and third point in each weapon card give 5%.
---
Why, in a discussion about maximizing damage, wouldn't you spend all 9 perks?
---
&gt; Bloody mess is a multiplier off the adjusted damage and not base weapon damage like the weapon cards. I'd recommend doing a search on the sub, was a couple good posts that got down into the math comparisons if you care that far.
---
That is worse. I've researched this extensively. Look here:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
Add 15% at different points and you'd realize that increasing the base damage is actually better. Not that you have cited any source besides "search reddit" to confirm where you got this information anyway.
---
I can't take anyone who uses cuck as in insult seriously. Grow up
---
There's already several breeds in F4/CreationClub that could be updated to F76.
---
Cats would be fun to have as well.
---
But of course, they had to be unkillable or they'd just have a short lifespan due to other players.
---
I like the idea a lot.
---
But they could go further and make all the workshops have a niche mechanic of sorts.
---
Maybe make it to where one workshop may have a chance of increased crop yields if you plants things there. 
---
Or add a workshop that would allow you to build a special bug lamp with traps that would attract ticks and other things for easy bloodpack farming.
---
How about using a few materials to turn leftover planes at the airport into built in windmill generators? 
---
I'm just spitballing here, but I wouldn't mind if some of the worshops even shared a unique mechanic.
---
There's also usually a clown outfit at Lakeside Cabins.  As far as the unruly ghouls go, I miraculously was able to finish this quest the other night. The only reward I got was a handful of caps 
---
If there are high level players in the area you will see level 60+ ghouls.
---
The route I took was to start at the enclave bunker service entrance and run around the side of the white spring building until you get to some cabins. Kill the ghouls here (I found 3 golfers here).  Then I ran to the other cabins past the golf club. Found the remaining two golfers here. Hope this helps.
---
They been banning me over and over again. But you are truly one of a kind. :D 
---
Did you hrad south out side of vault 76? Your supposed to go eastish and then North. Level 30 and up is south ECT..
---
I'm excited to see those players go there.
---
I guess it's to cut down on clipping.   Some make sence then some just shave your head and own it. 
---
You honestly dont get it, legendary weapons are supposed to be legendary weapons, they aren't legendary if a level 1 can craft them just because he scrapped a bunch of legendaries....
---
I saw him first time coming down the road and put a scope on him, he showed white, so didn‚Äôt fire. I figured out what he was about just because of the forums. 
---
That's why they are not PVPers. They are bullies and griefers.
---
The worst case scenario is that it becomes a time sink that Betheda keeps throwing more resources at, at the expense of more PvE content.
---
As is expected on this Reddit.  However, many of us don't use this Reddit.  Most people think this game is shit obviously (I'm not saying it is) yet posts about how good it is get tons of upvotes.  This Reddit has a unique crowd of carebare types and posts like this are bound to go up, and any dissenting bound to go down.  So dissenting voices avoid this sub.  I have 2k karma to spare so I'll voice for them.  I'm pretty sure Bethesda knows these are minority opinions and hopefully they can keep track of what things we are doing in game (IE player kills and camps destroyed) but we will see.
---
To me the TS nerf seems excessive, but the explosive nerf I would endorse, though maybe not quite as much percentage wise.  Then again I would have made legendary effects as mods you could craft and use to upgrade weapons so what do I know.
---
I'm not 100% in for a purely passive mode. Takes the teeth out of the game. 
---
They definitely need to change the griefing penalties and do something about stacking buffs though. 
---
Field Scribe, Field Scientist, and Union Uniform all have backpacks if you want them :)
---
I didn‚Äôt want to use power armor but it made the game a lot better.  But I don‚Äôt think that comes until 30 or something. 
---
This has happened to me a few times recently. Also Xbox 
---
Would‚Äôve been better if he was an actual NPC with character development 
---
Why would you think a level 1 could craft them. You are creating an absurd scenario to meet your opinion.
---
You'll never guess who hopped on that trend. And it's not the one who actually uploads fallout content still.
---
What are you guys playing on? 
---
Diablo 3 also did this, but to be honest there isn‚Äôt enough variety in legenadaries for this to even exist. Here come explosive bloodied two shots. That‚Äôs it. You won‚Äôt make anything else
---
Tested this with 50 cal on robots in Watoga and its literally the same dmg every bullet. Took like 30 bullets to kill. So Furious isnt working.
---
READ
---
Oh, I know how to do it! I've done it. :)
---
But I'm on an alt and I got thinking of how you can cannibalize the one corpse on that specific part of the quest, so that may mean that one can actually "make friends" with the deathclaw via the relevant perk cards.
---
Yeah, come to think of it - it's not listed on the item(s) as well. That would've been a dead give away.  
---
The thing is, though: I had an Bolstering BOS Left Leg with +25 Rad Resist once that had the same bug and I noticed it right away. One day, by changing the mods or it being in the stash for a while; it actually regained the +25 Rad Resist:  
---
\- [https://i.imgur.com/1NptnpH.png](https://i.imgur.com/1NptnpH.png)  
---
Let's hope they fix this soon, though.  
---
Will try on lunch, we have one of my old TV's and my old PS4 in the break room at our garage üòÇ
---
&gt;  It ruins the fun of working for it
---
There is no working for it in FO76 though, just praying to the RNG gods. I'm over level 200 now and the best drop I've ever had is a Mutant's pipe rifle with VATs accuracy and reload speed. It'd be far more rewarding if we had to build our own legendary gear, with unique challenges to unlock different effects and maybe a kill counter to unlock the slots.
---
I just made my badass party barn and was disappointed to see this as well, thank you for raising awareness for all the fancy roof connoisseurs
---
I see him frequently near the back of  Vault Tech Agriculture building, near Flatwoods. 
---
Much appreciated. It happens though, nothing to fret over.
---
People are adverse to change :P.
---
Oh! Got you! Sorry I had misunderstood what you were asking and I wad trying to help. Good luck finding an answer :)
---
So how does that mean it's my choice? My only choice is to "let him" .  That's not a choice.  Your point is factually incorrect.  Admit it.  I'm not saying you're wrong to approach things this way but your wrong to assert you have completed control and are in no way affected by YouTube reviews.  I've given an example why it's wrong.  Don't start making straw man arguments.
---
I hope so because it‚Äôs annoying that I can absolutely destroy a group who just keeps respawning to destroy my base and they have no caps so they‚Äôre not being penalized.
---
Also your a downvote abuser.
---
It was the base edition of the game that was being pulled. Tricentenial editions remained on sale. The original youtube video stated this, if I recall correctly. At any rate, he has since exchanged email and at least one phone call with Bethesda and has corrected himself.
---
I like it when he goes on his meat tirade
---
An easy way to farm some caps from vendors is going to white springs and picking up all the golf outfits.  I can find like a dozen throughly a white spring run if no ones taken them.  Plus I can sell them to the vendor for around 25 caps.  
---
My charisma isn‚Äôt that high either. 
---
I never worried, I knew it was a rumor from those piece of shit you tube click baiters.
---
This is awesome. I'm on PS4 and I'd love to take you on. I'll see if I can find a good outfit to make it a good show. I'm in Europe though, GMT+1, so I hope we can find a good time to try this. 
---
As far as I remember I have few thousands of .308 ammo, ign is k0mbinat0r
---
Lol.
---
Low level legendaries do drop btw, and gear strength scales so ummm actually I take it back. Let the newb build his lvl 1 TSE if he scrapped enough legendaries (although I think it should be more in depth than that personally).
---
I‚Äôd love half-size roofing pieces too, like the half size floors. My treehouse could desperately use that. 
---
Word.
---
Up voted.
---
&gt;I craft ammo to reduce steel quantities, and craft certain weapons to break to learn new mods. i bought the lever action rifle plan and the gauss rifle plan.  
---
&gt;i craft like 5 or 6 and then break for mods. This reduces loads of junk and keeps my stash in check. It also gives me mods at the same time.
---
I want to do this... but i can never have more than 25 screws at a time for some reason.  How do you keep up with the needed screws?
---
I don't think it is a great game,  but i do think i have had a great time playing it with 3 friends.   I have 3 hours on FO76 and 6 on Red Dead.
---
Under normal metrics those numbers should be reversed right?  I can acknowledge in every measurable way red dead is better but am having much more fun with my friends in fo76, so maybe it is a great game?
---
cuz n00b
---
What's the point of crying about youtubers crying about the game? Aren't you doing the exact same thing?
---
To be honest having dynamic server connections is a flawed. Not know if someone else has build their CAMP in your away. Not sure what Bethesda was thinking cause if they got their desired user based dup'g, CAMP locations and other things would have been greatly enhanced. 
---
It was a rumor started by misinformation.
---
r/fallout and r/pcgsming are extremely bitter about it.
---
I do believe that providing PvP services will cause migration of PvP oriented players to PvP serves, thus relieving the pressure from PvE people. I think its very beneficial for everyone.
---
That‚Äôs why a PvP server/ mode should be implemented for those who want it like myself.
---
Nope, sometimes the clubhouse is filled with robots.  I went in there the other day and got a bunch of brainbots and protectrons.  They even still had a solid amount of legendary item drops (though still mostly crap).  Then my friend went though there and it spawned all level 1 eyebots...  and again legendaries aplenty but mostly level 1 legendary items lol.
---
Neither is it listed in the B/E/R section of resistances, come to think of it.
---

Old now but should be spammed because haters will refude it regardless.
---
It might not add anything to your gaming experience, but other people enjoy it 
---
Frustrated me too, but when you get used to the scrapping/selling/dropping, and perking your stuff, you'll see that most of that shit is not necessary to hold.  Yeah its easier to grab everything and be upset when your stash is full, but dont grab everything...get used to what you use/need, and grab those things.  Also, just b/c a weapon/armour has a legendary effect doesn't mean its worth keeping.  I sell all Armour and guns that i dont need to vendors or drop for people.  Go through every item in your inventory and check its weight...you'd be surprised at how heavy stuff  can be..that you NEVER use.
---
Fallout 76 is not failing either.
---
That'll be 1200 Atoms each plz. 
---
Must of really like No Man's Sky or Mass effect Andromeda 
---
The person that made this post said "A: Scrapping legendaries" 
---
I don't think they were in 4, but having a hard time finding the pink, blue, Forrest, red, and yellow asylum uniforms. No one seems to sell em either, player or vendor.
---
Not just as bad but i agree people should play more and argue less.
---
That would be great...such a pain running out of screws
---
The towns could be tight and claustrophobic, or open
---
Hell if it gets those power hungry arses off the pve servers then he‚Äôll yea.
---
I want a kitty.
---
I think its the part when u lose caps.  Alot of ppl dont want to pvp because if u do you lose caps. I think pvp would be more fun if caps werent involved.  Maybe xp boosts instead would make it more interesting
---
Missed out on a lot before realizing there were time limited items in the store. I hate that we basically have to check the every day if we don't want to miss them. 
---

Thats harsh, why dont you see your son more often?
---
You can do that legit easy, just gotta know how the game works and not have alot of leeches he'll solo it's not uncommon for me to kill her in one landing
---
Don't be silly; everyone knows the only thing the SQB drops is vented ultracite plans.
---
lol
---
There is a youtuber called "Video Game Pope" who posts only the Atomic shop itmes when they are released.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you. Pvp servers are on the way. I just don't think they should rip it out of the regular mode. I'm also not confident adding more server options is something Bethesda can fully handle at the moment. 
---
I think the real issue here is the quality of legendary drops. in fallout 4 if I kill a legendary super mutant warlord, it'll drop something appropriate to a higher leveled character like a gatling laser or reinforced comabt armor. in fallout 76 however, if I kill a legendary super mutant warlord it instead drops a wooden armor piece or something more suitable for a lower level 
---
Will do. I'll be on today
---
Clickbait titles bring revenue. It‚Äôs not new. Destiny has them, Division has them, Hell event Anthem is starting to get them. It‚Äôs not an excuse for the shitty content.  But as long as it brings clicks they will continue to upload crap videos. I pretty much avoid anything fallout 76 on YouTube unless it‚Äôs a guide/tips. 
---
Or just leave post on here and invite ppl to the server before launching the nuke
---
I've still never found Graham, in over 100 hours of playtime :(

Feel you. Had the same problem when everyone can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt help with the queen.
---
Level lock the fight and don't buff her health. Boom.
---
Its pointless to talk about Youtubers - you'll just give them more traffic, even if its people checking them out in spite.  Half the time I wonder if the Youtubers have other people go around for them to get more traffic to their sites.
---
Yeah, I agree with you on that. üòÇ
---
Is your son named Shaun, by chance? I hear he's a good director, the Institute seemed happy.
---
Aw I want a pupper 
---
Yup I'm an idiot and just saw the W lol, my bad but good luck!
---
You can play solo: You do not have to go and find other people to play the game with.
---
PvP is always-on: People can come and kill you if they want to.
---
What cognitive issue do I need to have to see that these two things are not mutually exclusive?
---
Breaking News: The servers have multiple people on them. Holy shit does that mean they lied completely about playing solo?
---
i‚Äôve seen a few good rifle builds and shotguns are actually one of the more powerful builds around of it‚Äôs well done so i dont think you‚Äôd have to give up it if you dont want to. the quests are pretty unbalanced level-wise so after you grind enough xp to level up a little, the quests are gonna be really fast to go through so after all the quests are done all there is left to do really is polishing your build with more powerful weapons
---
that bug appeared after they fixed another bug (fast traveling/spawning inside of terrain)
---
PVP with Fallout's lame duck combat system just seems pointless
---
Dropping duped items deletes them from the game now since the last update.
---
Rip duper 
---
Loved it!
---
PS4 only, we‚Äôve talked to other multi-platform player groups, and have concluded it‚Äôs simply not effective to coordinate events across multiple systems.
---
NP :)
---
These posts are fairly new but took a while to catch on. I *think* its because the first handful got a good amount of downvotes, I'm assuming people thought I worked for Bethesda and didn't like the items. 
---
The gun wasn‚Äôt duped, though. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else with it!
---
My comment wasnt about money...Its a metaphor about taste for the game.
---
Never shows handmade for me and I rarely get one to drop even.. I'm level 69.. And still have only gotten 3 handmades. Never see the plans.
---
you know, there are also some people who think the earth is flat... so... posting badbuzz video about a video game doesnt seem to be a big deal these days...
---
You should "READ" the rest. Also, remember that people post ideas to forums like this in hope of making something they like even better or fixing a problem (game with shitty rng endgame). You should look at them as a jumping off point and remember that any proposed idea is unlikely to be 100% encompassing, balanced and perfect from the start.
---
the issue is monetization. Many are just greedy motherf\*\*rs, anything that gets them clicks and view, they'll do. And it seems nothing beats a good old hate-bait trashing.
---
Might as well sell their own mom.
---
Cannot wait to get the plans for that!
---
Where's the lead located up there?  I know of one lead patch on the cliff.
---
It doesn't show up under the armor piece's ratings, nor does it show up in the overall VATS rating of your combined armor.
---
For Poisoner's pieces with +25 poison resistance, this is not bugged and it clearly shows up in both spots.  My guess based on the difference is that these +25 radiation resistance pieces are indeed truly bugged.
---
Fantastic, I will give it a try next level upüëç
---
See I just see scorchbeasts as asshole players.  I don't need more assholes...they're annoying won't shut up and hover around you trying to get you killed.  So exactly like players and some are even hard to kill. I'll stick to pacifist and pve
---
yea, I'd like some crowd control.. I'm tired of my Grognaks axe harmlessly swinging through piled up ghouls
---
There is a vault dweller under Dyer Chemical as well. Found that one last night doing a quest.
---
Well that's what I thought about my handmade but I dropped it so my friend could repair it and damn son looks like it's outta here. 
---
Nice downvote, the hero reddit needed /s 
---
Im glad you made this post, because it's important to discuss the issue of pvp in this game. I don't understand why pacifist doesn't make me alive to still be killed by other players,  I shouldn't take slap damage if im in pacifist mode because I too live in it. 
---
I attempted one time to take a bounty and the guy one shotted me and got over 100 of my caps.   I was like huh?  I shot him with an explosive weapon he took no damage then one shotted me with an explosive weapon. It was wack. 
---
But anyway,  thanks for making this post I hope we can see maybe why some people enjoy pvp or agree with some of our annoyances. 
---
Saw a pied piper bot.... leading a large host of rats.  Non-aggressive.
---
WE NEED DOGMEAT
---
Its also my biggest wish to have a dog by my side, but i could also see the problems Bethesda maybe struggeling with. Maybe its kinda illogical if every (or many) Vault Dweller had a dog? Why? And where they come from? (speaking of "healthy" dogs, not the mutated ones). I could also imagine not everyone want a companion, so only choice is make them optional and only aesthetical because of balance reasons, or maybe make them a perk card? Either way i would love to have a pet companion even if he's just passive.
---
If you were on xbox, I could give you a clown costume
---
Yeah, that's what I meant; it doesn't show up on your item nor does it show up on your Pip Boy.
---
The thing is, though: I had a Bolstering  BOS Left Leg with +25 Rad Resist once that had the same bug and I  noticed it right away. One day, by changing the mods or it being in the  stash for a while; it actually regained the +25 Rad Resist:

Let's hope they fix this soon, though.

Well yeah who would invite such a toxic person that never says anything positive about the games he talks about.

You're having fun because you're hanging out with your friends. Try play the game alone for 3 hours and see what you think then.

I'm finding that the game is crashing when I'm making things on the armour bench since the last patch. My character keeps hammering away and my controls don't work. I can't get the map to come up so I can quit properly either. The only thing I can do to get out of it is to shut down and restart (the game, not the console). It's happened 4 times today at different armour benches and the same yesterday.  
---
The other interesting thing is that it happened just after I completed a horde event. The rest of the items I dropped were quest rewards, such as a radaway recipe or food items. Even they disappeared :(
---
Hey whats your ign, I can give you a explosive .44 for free
---
Damn shame
---
Yep. My first plan came from a treasure map.
---
Hmm I'll try stashing/unstashing and see if it helps - can't hurt.  Maybe logging out/in again too in between the stash/unstash.
---
I've ended up just selling my 3* at vendors or just ditching if I haven't wanted it haha.
---

 I know in about a month I had enough to buy the clown suit which would be 6 dollars but I got it for free
---
My favorite thing is when hes in the dam/water area waaaay beyond his normal spot. Or sometimes he gets trapped in an elevator. I love the personality on the bots.
---
Well, here we have the restriction of Prefix + Primary + Secondary. Meaning Two-Shot (Prefix) Explosive (Primary) 90% weight reduction (Secondary) is possible. But you'd have to pick between Two-Shot and Bloodied, you can't have both, because both are a Prefix. 
---
And if everyone starts making Two-Shot Explosive weapons, this tells the developers (if they are mathematically challenged and/or can't be bothered to run DPS tests on weapons) that it is overperforming and nerf it. Which they're doing next patch. Eventually, weapons would perform fairly close to one another, and there'd be more build variety.
---
I mean, theoretically, you're right. There will always be the "best-in-slot" (BiS) configuration. But between nerfs, buffs and changes to playstyles, these things will periodically change, and keep people playing. This isn't a bad thing, always having a BiS to chase if you're a min-maxer. 
---
This is the thing that FO76 got wrong. You have legendaries with bonuses, but no sets. All other games I mentioned - The Division, Elder Scrolls Online, Diablo 3, has legendaries with set  bonuses. That is, the more of the same set you equip, the more benefit you get. And in ESO, there were enough slots to run 2 set bonuses, one from 5-piece set, and one from 2-piece monster set obtained from killing veteran difficulty dungeon bosses. Created a lot of variety, and BiS weapon changed, depending on which sets you were running. FO76 is much weaker, because there's a lot less variety of legendary effects, and many of them are trash, or ultra-situational. Needs changing if they want the game to have any longevity, as does their reliance on absolute RNG.
---
In short, I do not believe that a change like this would harm the game in any way. Too many games similar to this one have done it before, and with very positive results. 
---
Oh thanks man! My ign is the same as my reddit name, ahandmadegrin. I'm actually in a good spot  with Tse right now. Bought a shotgun the other day and I have a Tommy gun as well. I'm always down to play, though! 
---
Very nice!!
---
Litterally happened to me the other day with an explosive handmade, a kid asked me to drop it so he could check it wasn't duped and it deleted my gun. 
---
I didn't think that it had been duped at first because I got it from a guy on reddit with decent trade karma
---
Now I'm out 4k caps and don't get any of the items I wanted in the trade 
---
I know it would never happen but if pvp servers went up I would like the game to force you to reroll a pvp only character, otherwise I could grind in pve with less risk and then use those items in pvp which would be dumb, not to mention the duped tses would be eliminated
---
Spotify? 
---
Not all YouTubers are in it to make click-baity drama fueled videos for just views. 
---
I would pay so much for that

Head canon:  Automated playlists, set up by the responders.

In the end it's not going to be their circlejerk of hate that ever fixes Fallout 76... it's going to be the love and support of the fans enjoying the game giving honest to god feedback instead of a bunch of hate calling the game trash and calling anyone that enjoy a the game a shill. I intend to stay by this game and hopefully see a major comeback for it. I really have enjoyed FO76 and I am hopeful for its future as the first game of its kind Bethesda has tried.
---
Crazy, isn't it? And you get peanuts for them, while golf outfits and glowing meat sell for tons of caps. 
---
This also works with Fort Defiance - the straitjackets in there have a value of 200, sell for around 25, and only have a weight of 0.1. Plus, there is a bunch of useful junk and ghouls (EXP, junk) in there as well. 
---
Oh I see. 
---
I got this gun from an event drop just over a week ago, so I don‚Äôt see how the gun could be duped!
---
don't forget the frowny vault boy and/or a photoshopped picture of todd looking surprised
---
Blue screens kill me every session. Haven't played since Sunday as I logged in and got a blue screen before my camp and body had even loaded in, which was the final straw. Hope they can sort so people like us can play the game we enjoy
---
Using Fortnite as an example because executives don't care about what type of game you make as long as you make a profit, it's all about following trends.
---
Go where the money is, the thing about it is that a lot of higher ups don't realize that Fortnite is mostly player driven to keep the experience interesting as it is a battle royale but Fallout is, or atleast should be, content driven. If it's as financially unsuccessful as the metrics are saying then 76 is mostly on life support, they're fixing bugs and trying to do as much as possible to make it more appealing to the general audiences.
---
3 or 4 weeks from now [Games Journalism Outlets] are going to release articles about "The troubled development" of Fallout 76, they're still collecting statements but it's just so good. So much content was planned for the base game and then they had it retro-fit as content updates. 
---
There's hundreds of items that were planned to be free CAMP items that are being held back so they can release them as seasonal or surprise update items.
---
Complete mismanagement of the game, human AI were planned to be in the base game but were removed because *A SINGLE Zenimax executive* thought that players would confuse them for other human people and that "Wouldn't killing them make some quest lines unplayable." so they just got rid of all humans instead. This was brought up in a pre-production meeting but a lot of stuff was scrapped because of it.
---
lol a rabbit in Fallout? Then please like the killer rabbit from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
---
A little dry, but very reasonable.
---
Toxic Valley and Ash Heap are for your level, Whitespring is a high level farming spot so you should keep away for a while. 
---
You'll get to see them eventually, son.
---
Shh! They'll nerf it!
---
My first character was a stealth type. Stealth can still be pretty strong, but it's hard to enjoy the game because 12 enemies will spawn in right in front of you. Sometimes just after you finished killing them all. So I made a new character who is a bit more direct. The game is still bad, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun. I have a rocket-powered baseball bat with nails sticking out of it now. Fuck subtlety. Just need to get some heavy armour.
---
Excellent. Mine is twiggy087. Ill keep an eye out for you next time I'm roamin the wastes.
---
Bloodied isn't my play style, so I'd probably take the Anti-Armor Fire Axe given the choice.  Fire Axes in general are pretty competent weapons, and Anti-Armor might free up some SPECIAL points if you rely on Incisor.
---
I think it was better when everyone got loot from the supply drops. I had saved a bunch door the Xmas rush and was pumping them out for new players all over a few servers. Now it has only one your loot and its theft to unlock and loot it.
---
Plus it was never mentioned in the patch notes. I'm starting to feel like there until ally sweating the player base by doing stuff like this, there's no incentive to help or play with others.
---
NP! I appreciate the enthusiastic help that many fellow players display. :)
---
Free to play will kill the game in its current state. The atom store doesn't have stock that appeals enough to prop up server support. If they went the ESO route with a craft bag and desirable,appealing atom shop stuff then it may work. However I doubt the servers could handle everyone using an ESO style craft bag. 
---
I get this problem sometimes after I've re-spawned after I've been killed. It makes it hard to get your bag without getting killed again. 
---
I've joined several of those, and while everyone tried their best you still only get a couple of minutes before all the level 20 randoms swarm the zone.  Seeing a bunch of high level players in there seems to draw them in even faster because they assume it'll be a free ride.
---
I agree. I just have issues with such ignorant behavior that it is hard to stay silent a lot of times.
---
Times are wierd.
---
They profit from the hate train. Fallout 76 perfectly summarizes the state of our culture. Sad.
---
I did the same thing. The bastard chased me all the way down the mountain. I finally hid in a pulowski preservation tube.
---
No problem, I always like helping nice people. I'll be on in a few hours, the pistol is level 45 it has the exploding effect, medic effect, and +50 resist while aiming
---
I guess.  One player one-shotting another player who's eligible but not interested seems like some odd PvP to me though.
---
How is this even a concern?  You have to buy the game and there's no plan to give the game away for free.  Ignore the youtubidiots.
---
you're crazy fo76 if bad and wrong and your opinion is bad and wrong :(
---
Silly me, of course!
---
Lol
---
If u don't want to play with other people (solo), fallout 76 isn't the right game? Or maybe they should have an offline mode.. separate servers will kill any remaining player base, fragmenting groups into smaller communities is a bad idea for this game imo..
---
I will say, Carnivore made it so that when I was hungry I could just walk a bit outside my camp and kill any animals I saw for their raw meat. I never seem to be really hurting for food but the weight of it is quite annoying sometimes 
---
Oh cool! I might take you up on that actually. It's nice to have a light weight gun with some range. 
---
Maybe one day tood will let us cross platform like fartnite
---
That's very much a possibility. The way I figure it, this whole game was slapped together because of PUBG/Fortnite, Bethesda saw how much money those guys were raking in, and wanted a piece of the delicious, delicious BR pie. Sadly, as a company, they don't have the chops to pull something like this off. So what might happen now is they will split their resources, and end up failing to deliver, massively, on both fronts. 
---
So this decision could very well come back and bite them on the ass, that's for sure. I mean, the game already has Hunter/Hunted, but how many people play it? Almost nobody. The game is just too broken, mechanically and balance-wise, for its PvP or PvE to be taken seriously right now. So I don't know how they expect people to have fun in PvP, when dupers got to keep the millions of grenades, bobbleheads and other consummables, and bobbleheads still stack. 
---
Lol I know how the prefixes and legendary slots worked I was just saying there‚Äôs only gonna be 1 clear choice, but yes dude I agree with everything you said lol especially the sets and bonuses. Would make farming feel more rewarding getting a set peice 
---
The quartering and heels vs baby face videos were horrible 
---
Someone is bad at fighting ghouls lmao.
---
Maybe, but not enough commercials for Cram and Sugar Bombs. :)
---
Did we read the same thing? 
---
You are totally making this connection to the atom store yourself. 
---
I enjoyed the game but once I hit level 70 there's really not much more to it other than your typical shoot and loot game. Which is fine I guess but once you have the best gear what's left? New content? Story missions? Repeatable events? Hope there's more to come
---
It should also enable NPCs, engaging quest lines, and interesting perks. But it's neo-bethesda, so we have to compromise.
---
Sure, why not, kind stranger! Maybe I have an armor piece you could use. I have a couple 3* pieces. Let me know when you're online. 
---
I think the main reason why they did it like that is if you offer the legendary perks as regular mods there is no real reason hunting for it. You just craft and scrap until you have the desired mod. 
---
But as of now I would even prefer this solution so everybody can level instead of reducing it so badly that there is literally no more reason to farm for it. why should anyone try to get this weapons if is not worth the grind anymore? That is the real problem imho. 
---
The more and more as I discuss it the more I feel Bethesda didnt invest enough time to have a good loot system ready. 
---
I never considered using those to hide from enemies. At least they are useful for something. 
---
I agree to some extent, the parts to craft it must be rare. The crafting is cool, sooo many possible pieces but anything you craft is junk compared to something you just pick up. While we're at it something other than a hardened receiver would be nice without nerfing yourself.
---
Yeah.  I actually got straight jackets up to 44. 
---
I‚Äôll have to check out for defiance a little better. 
---
he might be selling outfits, you know.
---
Alright, I'll let you know when I get on!
---
I miss the good days 
---
I can‚Äôt wait. It‚Äôs going to make workshops and nuke zones and high traffic areas interesting. Looking at you whitespring.
---
I doubt bag put any thought into it. Likly answer would be its automated. Why there's no old time commercials ill never know... It would be a nice break from the constant 5 songs that play. 100s of songs my ass.
---
I was exploring Watoga yesterday when someone launched at Prime. I grabbed a bunch of stims and radaway out of my stash, hopped into my Power Armor and wandered over to check it out. I was 47 at the time. I tried to stay out of the way and made an effort to help with the trash mobs so the higher levels could focus more on the queen. It was my first real foray into a nuke zone.
---
My question is this: Did I make things worse by virtue of my very presence? Like is the queen's health based on the number of players present, etc?
---
Make sure you click the "dislike" button that no one ever tells you to make sure to click if you didnt like the video.
---
An over-repaired drill with armor pen drill bit is a gift from above. Make one and try it on the ghouls at Whitespring. You will not be upset!
---
Most people outside of this sub don't like the game. You can't really blame youtubers for catering to their viewerbase.
---
Water can definitely be scarce when you first start. I suggest this.
---
The Charleston Landfill has a water purifier sitting in a puddle of water.  Claim the workshop then craft and hook up a generator that produces 10 power to the purifier.  Once powered, the purifier begins producing 5 purified waters every five minutes or so. Not only will that be enough to keep you from constantly dehydrating, but you can also dash off to the Charleston train station and sell any excess purified water you have to the vendor bot.  Also check what the bot is selling as far as weapons and plans go.  You can use the caps you earn from selling water to buy better weapons or armor.
---
I find really enjoyable when getting in battles with full squads
---
I don't want everybody out there with a Dogmeat. He's too pure for this world. I would be okay with Charisma builds getting an actual animal companion similar to him. They deserve it for putting up with my One Punch Man Raider nonsense. Reward the investment in that route.
---
 More Charisma, bigger pet. Nothing massive (it still has to be able to fit in buildings, etc), but let it grow with perk investment. I'd love Charisma cards that add different abilities or functionality to your pet. 
---
Yeah honestly I was worried that Bethesda wouldn't have good collision messes for them but they are Rock solid.
---
I've played the game, by myself, for about 150 hours now and I'm still having a lot of fun. My wife has watched me play and wanted to give it a try so we bought a second copy and another ps4 and she's played it with me for another 50 hours so far. Its far from perfect, I agree that food and inventory management is a little annoying and some of the glitching can be pretty aggrivating but the game isn't "unplayable". I just feel like everyone is jumping on the hate bandwagon without actually putting a bit of time in. If you quit 5 hours in then you're missing out on the fun the mid to late game has. The first few levels are trying, but it's the same way as plenty of other games are. Once you've got a few perks and you start exploring the rest of the map the game really begins. 
---
You posted this topic in like different fallout sub reddits. Farming Karma much?
---
Besides the high level spawning high level issue, some places are just a bit uneven in their spawning. Toxic Valley is pretty much a cakewalk at level 25, but those level 30 rad scorpions are a bit harsh. I'm near your level and I find using a suppressed weapon helps, as long as I can pick things of one or two at a time. I avoid places with mobs and/or endless rapid spawning. It does feel very satisfying not being terrorized by level \~14 enemies any more. Taking it slow, but I know I'll feel the same way about the level 30s soon enough. The bog and the mire can wait.
---
Hm, that's pretty interesting, what happened with your Bolstering leg. I'll be sure to do some experimenting next time I get a bugged piece; didn't think there was anything that could be done.
---
Harsh (because I certainly suffer from that) but basically accurate. 
---
This is patently untrue.  There are quests that take low-mid level ranges to the White Springs.  Saying that lower players don't belong there is a form of blatant elitism and level-gating that was never meant to be.  High level players need to take some responsibility for their carelessness and clean their spawns.  Don't put this on the lower players.  They have as much right to quest there as any 100+ player.  
---
I don‚Äôt know what that means. I‚Äôm just trying to get the attention of the community.
---
Did the same thing. In the process of hauling ass, lost my bearings and ran off a cliff.... Straight up Looney Toons shit. 
---
I‚Äôm lvl8 and was harassed for an hour last night by a lvl 115&amp;76 for an hour they just kept killing me until I left the area. Complete horse shit
---
Just make them lay down or warp back to your CAMP when they run out of hp. Perhaps even a doghouse for them to respawn at?
---
boo thumbs down! fallout 76 ducks and anyon who like it is wrong :(
---
Yeah. I bet you are.
---
That's gonna be a duper. I'd leave that shit alone. 
---
By player I assume you mean duper?
---
My poor subjects :(
---
Apologies, it comes from overcoming my own hoarding problem. 
---
I improve myself, and survive...its like real life...do you want to die after 70 years on earth, or do you still enjoy living?
---
Yeah, the quests are gone...mostly tutorial anyway.
---
I meet new people, and have fun helping; also, i still get rush when i find a better gear.  I dont have a goal...its a game that gives you plenty of ideas to create your own quests and use strategy.  Like I said in another post, this game just hits the right notes for me.  
---
Just last night, I had a lot of emotion trying to bring down a 3\* Sentry Bot in the middle of the bog.  Sucked up tons of resources, but it was a real challenge, and I got an awesome TS out of it.
---
The more I play, the more i see value in things i had never touched...like chems, mutations, bobbles and magazines. Right now, im working on getting all mutations with the fully loaded Class Freak perk. 
---
If on Xbox, I'll be your Huckleberry. GT is Kaise7en
---
See the attached picture for the thread. That‚Äôs the eververse store. He even mentions the eververse store himself in his comments and post so obviously there is a connection.
---
Lab grown meat in the Vault, my dude. 
---
Go ask on r/fo76bazaar
---
Oka, have a good day.
---
Mine would only be SBQ heads then XD haha 
---
Give us Brahmin!
---
In all fairness, the respec ability was intended to correct mistakes, not rebuild entire characters. That's why we can run more than one character. I understand your frustration and I know that if I had to level 20 or 30 times before I even got to start picking perks again, I'd feel a sincere lack of motivation to work on it. But BGS isn't going to let us do a whole reshuffle since they provide us multiple character slots.
---
start, left bumper, challenges.
---
I play every evening, with an exception of today-friday as I am afk because of work
---
I like the idea of "raiding parties" you and some of your friends hop into the pvp server and go smash other people's stuff. All while trying to not get eaten and shot. 
---
Just the Initiate Paint, others were from Dev Room
---
I guess it's all about consistency of looting the same places with each sessiom, that have a stable amount of screw income. Just a small example is Whitesprings: when you arrive and enter the building from the backyard, you can loot 1 clipboard from the small reception table on the left side, go down the stairs and turn left to see a long reception desk with assaultron behind it, there you will also find multiple clipboards as well as phones. Go towards the long hall with different shops and visit the toy-store, where you can pickup a small car from the floor + a full  giddy-up butter cup (yellow horse with loads of screws). Then visit the SPA, where they have loads of clipboards and phones on the front desk. Imagine doing it every time you enter the Whitesprings and not going mad from repeating the same thing over.. and over.. and over.. and over.. and over again, and then you will have enough screws to craft and scrap weapons.
---
And where did you get any of this info?
---
Thank you. Pretty obvious lol and tommake matters worse I am level 30. Should have known by now.
---
The whole Mistress of Mysteries story arc is fantastic as well.
---
Reading everything and listening to everything is why I have racked up 200+ hours of playtime and still haven't finished the main story.  I knew it was going to be a while before we received content updates, so I paced myself and have really taken as much in as possible.
---
Need a new one? I'm on PC and can hook you up!
---
Yeah that frowny vault boy on every damn YouTube video is becoming so fucking anoying to see.
---
I don't watch their videods because I know most of them are just reading from reddit or jumping on any hate train there is this week, and the funny thing is that all their gameplay is based on level 5 to 15, kind shows that they do not play the damn game and they are here only for views.
---
The queens health and resistances is based on the number of players in the area.  That is true.  That being said, even a non-endgame player can contribute if they do their part to clean adds, to contribute perks in a team, and don't leech then shack-cower to leave others to pick up the slack.  
---
What system ? 
---
CAPS !!!!111oneone
---
Oh I def dropped it all
---
GT is Kaise7en, I'm down! 
---
On xbox, unfortunately :(
---
But that‚Äôs very kind of you!
---
Can anyone explain how I get a collect your supply drop quest when I don't turn in anything first?  I've seen this pop up - never really went to check one out though.
---
Does this to me almost everytime I load in now.
---
no
---
People cannot come and kill you.  Ever.  You can engage in activities that will flag you for PvP, sure.  A loser can "slap" you constantly, and your best recourse is to block and change servers.  Or a cheater and stack bobbles and actually do something that was never intended.  If you consider FO76 a PvP centric game, that's laughable.  It's an option, and I believe the developers specifically stated it's a consentual PvP style - which is like toddler level PvP.
---
I never said it's fair, just the truth. It's a high level farming spot and low level players are perfectly welcome to get wrecked there if they want. 
---
I know it wasn't designed for that purpose, but that's how it is right now. Even with ghouls being nerfed, it hasn't changed. I'm not one of the *high level elitists*, I'm just trying to be honest. 
---
Yeah it happens to me on PS4 just let game load fully. Or you will have to close it and wait again.
---
That's fair. I could make a new character but I don't want to lose all the plans I've found and have to eventually do the quests again.
---
The first time I encountered Graham was, IIRC, the very day the game released. He was glitched into a bluff near the dried out lake NE of Charleston, so all I could see was his head sticking out of some rocks while Challey was half floating there and I was like, "Ok, this is weird."
---
I have since learned to greatly appreciate him, esp. since he hooked one of my characters up with Handmade rifle plans (at level 11!).
---
I'm level 128 and I've still got 1500+ atoms. I've bought multiple outfits, C.A.M.P. items and poses. The atoms just keep flowing for me. 
---
The game might be even better when you play it alone. It feels like a real Fallout game when it's just you. When playing with a team I just rush into buildings with barely a care because I've got two or three other people to bail me out if things go sideways. When it's just me I have to scout a bit and make plan of attack before engaging. I've also had a few occasions with genuine feelings of dread because I was in an area I was unfamiliar with and surrounded by enemies. I haven't had that feeling in a videogame since my first time through Fallout 3.
---
Ps4 Pro
---
I'm not sure but hey you're out there helping and not them to glom XP. 
---
I wanndered over there around the same level as you and I was pretty clueless - I got some shots in and realized that my crappy weapons weren't going to help, so I just tried to sledge all the mobs to let the high level guys do their work.  I like to think I helped some. 
---
Ah can‚Äôt help ya 
---
Not at all. They're just annoying. You just end up with an entire building worth of lame ass not-zombies piled at your feet. It's stupid, not hard. 
---
you're good bud
---
I'm sad that this is happening to you but I'm glad I'm not the only one. 
---
Or the key from uhhh wilsons? garage, in the north eastish part of the forest. There is a note in an apartment near the museum talking about it.
---
But fo76 has no NPC's /s 
---
It's a bug that happens. I have lost a X-01 jet pack . I crafted my x-01 armor and got lucky and found the jet pack mod at white spring. I handed it and my torso over to my friend so he could install the mod since i didn't have enough materials. He went and dropped it and it disappeared. Took another week of constant server hops until I found the mid on sale again.
---
Some good ideas here but I really don't think enemies need to be nerfed much other than Rad Rats and Super Mutants being less bullet-spongey.  Mole rats running away are pretty crappy too - wouldn't be so bad if they were not constantly needed to kill off as an objective or locking you out of fast travel.
---
Though it was my turn to post about it this week.
---
I've only had a few as well but of the three, two of them were just being asses. 
---
One guy spent an entire SBQ fight pulling mobs to my stealth sniper to get them to aggro me and then standing in front of me and trying to corral me into a fissure.
---
The second guy just jumped around me doing slap damage for a bit while I just kept on trucking along and healing as needed and then out of nowhere, he power fisted me out of existence.
---
Yeah, sounds like a duper trying to unload before he gets banned.
---
And maybe get some other players banned if they take the stuff. 
---
They said they were looking at players with unreasonable amounts of rare items, like 50,000 ballistic fibers and such. 
---
I would imagine that some might think if they get players that weren't duping to pick up stuff, and get banned, that Bethesda might not be so quick with banning people, or let people get their accounts back if there's enough wrongly banned players.
---
I hope you didn't take it. Let it fade into the ether. 
---
They are the ones that wouldn't make it if the Wasteland was real. 
---
All the story lines that can be uncovered and they are worried about graphics @_@ youtubers...
---
Well u can just pick cards and little alter special. 20levels is not much even after 150
---
In the last 10 hours of play I have only found 2 venders that actually have more than 10 caps. WTF is going on ??? this is ruining the game for me as a I cant buy any plans. I can even clear out my stash , I ve had to throw away heaps of resources I should be able to sell.. Is it just an Xbox Problem???
---
Only people with duped TSE weapons and full sets of Sentinel armor enjoy PvP.
---
As expected adding PvP to Fallout did nothing but attract nerf crybabies and cheaters to the game 
---
Idea for a new community quest.. persuade Grahm to set up a new radio station by collecting him copious amounts of different meats. 
---
You're more or less taking her as serious as I am when I dismiss her mentally, instead of it just becoming background noise for me, it becomes a scrochbeast fight from 76. In either instances are we do them any favors by letting it go on, or should we not just say, sorry not engaged in this in the least right now
---
My GT is GuentherLR all I get at Watoga/Harpers is the   brick/metal and garage door plans. I will be online in like 10 hours(at work) msg me if you still need. 
---
I had this problem. Have you done the Mistress of Mysteries(or whatever it‚Äôs called) mission? I did in my late teens early 20s, got a few levels, and the Blade of Bastet. Currently level 49, I almost exclusively use the Blade of Bastet (now leveled up) and an upgraded modded combat shotgun. I was afraid of going into dangerous places by myself, as my husband (higher level than me) was always there before. Now he‚Äôs taking a break and I‚Äôm on my own. Look at your map and look for places that you want to go. If there are already higher level players there, avoid. However if there are lower level players, let them start the mission or area, then you can go in and have lower level mobs and help the other player out, still accomplishing the mission. 
---
Okay that's fair.  It is an unfortunate syndrome though.  It needs all players doing their part to stop the careless behavior from spreading further.  Offer to escort a lower level if you see them questing.  Clean up spawns instead of sprinting through.  We could all do better if we try and be considerate of the other players.
---
I'll never understand why people sit and watch "youtubers." More less care about their clickbait opinions.
---
After 500hours some players have they can have even more ammo on mules
---
It's a survival game though.. It should be a struggle. The game is already too easy yet people are complaining about weight, food and hunger, etc. It's not hard to manage it really isn't. I'm all for stash increase as well. But my whole point is that the current limit is imposed because you are supposed to make survival choices. Do you need 400 gunpowder if you are melee? No, get rid of it. It's not vital to your survival. Do you need 191343 radaway if you aren't going into nuke zones? No you don't, get rid of some. The hoarder mentality from past games will hamper your game play, that's all I'm saying. 
---
Plans are easy enough to acquire and trade for. There's a whole player economy based on trading, and there will always be someone who has a plan that someone else is willing to buy. If you need to spend real cash to get them, then you are just one of many who perpetuate the problem that everyone is complaining about lol its not hard at all. If you don't have the time invested to find the plans, that's why the player Market exists.
---
I didn't miss your point. Your point is that atoms are vital to play, and they are not. They are cosmetic, and until Bethesda goes back on their word, that's how they will stay. The content that is pushed through there is essentially all recycled material.. And so what if it's new? It's still cosmetic, so you aren't even proving your point. New.. Fresh content that is more than a skin will take time and development, for that we will wait and see what is coming in future updates. The way the atoms are set up, there is a very small amount of players that are constantly dishing out money for them. I get it, it can be pricey and The Limited sales can cause someone who normally wouldn't want to spend money, to do so. That is the incentive to get impulse buyers, but even then there is nothing that will break gameplay so I still don't understand what all the fuss about the atomic store is about.
---
i'd go for that. :)
---
By "working for it," I mean trolling for legionaries, and i hear ya...its a bitch to find something great, but super fun when you do.  Keep trying... at level 200 you know where to look, and if you stick with it..you'll have an awesome weapon that you earned.  if they were easy to get (like buying them), then no fun...no reward.
---
I really want to know the answer to this as well. I may use my second character to test this because I'm really curious if it can work.
---
I have put thousands of hours between Fo3, FoNV, Fo4 and now Fo76. It‚Äôs easily my most played game series. Fo76 lacks the shock and awe that Fo3 had after leaving the vault. It was my first and I still remember the sting of the sun as my eyes adjusted to the wasteland. I have never felt so helpless. FoNV was similar, but I felt more at home (knowing what to do) and it was also better written. Fo4 wasn‚Äôt as much of a let down to me compared to others, but it was shallow. I still put almost a month of days straight into it. More than once. Now there‚Äôs 76 and I think I almost reached my peak. I hit level 120ish and I cannot imagine going through that again. I‚Äôm maybe at 200 hrs and I would never play again if my character was lost. I‚Äôm bored. I have rebuilt my c.a.m.p. over seven times. I have launched multiple nukes, and I still have 3 or 4 nuclear cards in my stash. The end game is easy. I could care less if I bring another Scorchbeast Queen down for part of a wing, a heart and a locker plan. 
---
Enough of this, it‚Äôs already a wall of text and another complaint about 76. 
---
It always just seemed obvious to me that NV crashed a lot more than 3.  New Vegas itself, either traveling between the 3 chunks of city or traveling out of a building into one of the chunks, seemed to trigger a game crash fairly regularly.
---
While I found the end game/story more interesting in NV the crashes always made me recommend 3 over NV to people.  To date NV is the only game (any game not just Bethesda RPG) where all my save files were "corrupt" and I was forced to start over from square one.  This happened *twice* first time was after I was explore happy and had almost 100hrs in the game without having stepped into New Vegas proper,  pay my 2000 caps, enter city and game crash...none of my save files work, not even the one I made immediately after character creation.  The second time was much closer to the final story mission(I do all the side stuff first) and basically caused me to walk away from NV for over a year.
---
If you're being honest I'm glad you had such great luck though it's really not hard to find examples of NV being a buggy mess on release.
---
By fully load do you mean stand still for a bit after loading in?
---
I have this issue. It seems if you don‚Äôt spam the buttons when you load in, it will correct itself. I thought it was my internet connection. 
---
For sure man ill be on later too ill send you a friend request! Thanks!
---
Yeah this is happened to me a few times you basically have two options either leave and join another server or wait. one of the tricks to keep it as short as possible is don't try to open your Pip-Boy try to pull out your weapons and until you can pull out a weapon do not load the Pip-Boy.
---
for some reason if you load your Pip-Boy first it seems to freeze up a lot longer and be worse. PS4 Pro here too.
---
Actually I would love some old timey commercials tossed in. It would up the immersion.
---
Absolutely agree! Add an interior corner piece to that list. Had to mod to get it in 4 and it‚Äôs still missing in 76. 
---
The bag disappearing has nothing to do with duped items. On PS4 it happens almost every time you drop something. I have a bunch of random crap I usually try to split between my team after we finish events or we so area run through to gather materials. If I forget to drop a single item to test usually the bag disappears. It's usually just ammo and other junk I picked up. I have noticed it occurs more when your not on a flat ground. If its just duped items why are scorched and super mutants running around with duped junk.
---
SHAWWWN! Shawn!? SHAWN!!
---
Future content idea you can find songs in the wastelands when you're losing things that then get added to your rotation.
---
Heck I wouldn't even be sad if they had to add songs to the Atom shop to be able to pay licensing on them. I'm not talking songs that I could play myself on Spotify or something but curated Fallout appropriate music.
---
Lol. Can we expect 300 individual posts from the 300 people who actually care / want this ?
---
Ps4? I have something similar. 
---
Not sure of the exact details but it's 3* and explosive.
---
I just have my camp on an acid spot. Gives me more than enough for smelting. 
---
It's accurate. I've been testing this over 100+ jumps. No Jet Pack, no calibrated shocks, no stealth boy, no tesla coil. HUD twice. Dynamo once. Emergency protocols twice. Etc. XB1 platform.
---
Okay I'll try this when I jump on later. Thank you. 
---
Yes, you can.  Get Animal Friend perk rank 3, then aim at every fox you see.  You'll eventually get the option to "tame" it, at which point it'll live at your camp, and just hang out.
---
I built a wall fence around Graham &amp; Chally when their AI was having trouble navigating my base because his trade route went through my base, sadly it will not persist across disconnects / server hops. But the 2 times it has happened has been a lot of fun.
---
no problem come back and let me know if it makes a difference for you so I know if I should be recommending it to other people but it really made a difference for me.
---
Basically I try to switch between weapons because that seems to be the first thing that starts working and once that happens it's just a short bit before I can actually pull out a weapon.

I agree with you, and I consider myself to be a considerate player. I don't know if telling inconsiderate players to stop being such shits would change any behavior though. I think they're well aware that they're being shits, they honestly don't care if they wreck someone else's game. 
---
All the posts in this sub about youtubers are annoying
---
W00BY is!
---
Yes the vendors actually rotated inventory at high levels BEFORE the last update. Since this last update those two of the three high level vendors only have Radium Rifle for me.
---
Appalachia. Have you even played FO76 bro? 
---
Rabbits are for eating.
---
I have the 18% version and have not seen it proc yet. Using it for a few days. I am hoping it's bugged but assumed they would have fixed it by now so likely not?
---
I think he is a quality part of the game, but I did get a little annoyed on the meat talk. It was a bit Buba Gump and I just wanted to get away from him at that point. 
---
You mean you don't scrap it before you put it in your stash? That's kinda counter productive, guy
---
I think they were hoping to do a content update in January. But i think they saw that there were a lot of bugs that people really wanted fixed first. So it seems January is going to be two patches, both focusing on bug fixes. 
---
So the first serious content update might not come till mid February. 
---
This is all speculation, which i'm basing off their communication.
---
For example, the end of January we might see the new PvP options go live. They didn't give a date, but they have talked about it a couple times.
---
It's kind of odd because I have seen more golfer spawns since the last patch.
---
Easiest way to do it is there's a spawn point in the parking lot right outside the golf club and just server hop until you find a world where it's the golfer ghouls.
---
you should be able to get five of them at the golf club alone but if not there should also be ghouls at the workshop on the other side of white springs.
---
I enjoy stalking wanted players with chameleon/sniper. 1-2 headshots and that (normally 10 cap) bounty is all mine! 
---
Then I hang around to see if they come back for the loot bag. I put some stims/food/water in there too if they haven't seeked revenge.
---
Ye, it is bethesda game. It you load in nuke zone, let it kill you few times. And be happy you made sacrifice to atom.
---
&gt;It feels like a real Fallout game when it's just you.
---
Does it really? Because last time I played a real Fallout game it had a story and tons of characters, and it took place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland... 
---
I don‚Äôt think they get a free pass from criticism, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth your time to worry about what content they make. It doesn‚Äôt affect your enjoyment of the game at all. 
---
Hi, again!
---
Platform - Xbox One, Gamertag - Royal Octo, all other info N/A.
---
It's not a huge deal, but maybe work on collision of C.A.M.P. objects? They're... Incredibly finicky. Ridiculously so. Crops float above the ground in some places, and then when they're actually TOUCHING the ground, it says "object requires support". Support beams won't sink into the ground, because they then intersect with another object. Their entire purpose in life is to sink into the ground. It's literally why they exist. It's cruel to hold them back from their true calling. The stairs that take up two squares are buggy, and it takes ages to convince anything to clip to them. The doors float in front of brick doorways. Some stairs have the same issue as support beams. The metal staircases also have invisible, solid beams above their ends? The pink(?) rug from the atom shop refuses to sit near walls. Some doors refuse to clip to doorways, citing "the object is floating", etc.
---
There are so many issues with C.A.M.P.s that I can't list all of 'em.
---
Keep up the good work, Bethesda! I know you're trying to fix these issues, and I'm sorry if you already knew all these ones.
---
True, but most builds won't be as effective as possible by trying to spec for multiple things. It's possible, but most of the time it won't be perfected. If they put in perk card builds that are quick swappable.. Then maybe. I see your point though 
---
How much for one Calibrated Shock?
---
Minecraft, and SoT off the top of my head.
---
Except to whom would we be delivering the drinks?  Everyone is dead.  My guess is that the atomic explosions set off all the private stills in the mountains and killed everyone.
---
Also I think it‚Äôs funny the game literally starts off with us waking up after a night of heavy drinking &amp; partying.  Now go rebuild America you hung over vault dwellers!
---
(Without a real means to trade with others, build settlements, nor repair structures already in existence)
---
Are you talking about the Handmade Night vision Scope?
---
&gt; We can barelly play with the limited stash and camp budget as it is.
---
That's just disingenuous and full of shit. quit hoarding
---
Which is cool, but it doesn‚Äôt follow you and fight for you and act as a companion. 
---
Confession:  If people have their purifiers and doors unlocked they likely don't care.
---
I'd like to be able to charge them on a fusion generator in a C.A.M.P.
---
Apparently we do need dogs, because I looted a Dog Helmet last night, but I'm not allowed to equip it.
---
Wait, so you are saying the person who does all the work and essentially "owns" the nuke needs to do their due diligence for the sake of everyone else? lol c'mon man.  
---
If anything, the lower levels need to do their due diligence and stay away. Heck, there are plenty of people who even wish the high levels would stay away, because it's a lot quicker for us to solo her than to have others show up, regardless of level and gear.  
---
Yeah. Then the nocturnal would be worthless
---
So long as you dont kill my cows, I am fine. 
---
You've hit on the crux of the main problem all "survival" games share: basic surviv9 for it's own sake, isnt fun. It's a tedious process of collection and refinement if necessary items literally for it's own sake.
---
Which is why the game needs overarching goals beyond just surviving for the sake of it. Because right now, that's really all there is.
---
It‚Äôs not being ruined by YouTubers. Is it being overly criticized by YouTubers, yeah. But ruined, no. Ignore the stupid videos and play the games you enjoy. 
---
Any idea on how much cobalt?
---
I usually wait about 30 seconds before doing anything when I load in. That seems to work for me. I am also on a ps4 pro.
---
Everyone can have his own opinion - I disagree with you, but maybe because I don't see F76 as strictly MMO, more like Fallout game with online elements. And yes, offline would be awesome!

The world is filled with automated systems, robots that have kept on working for decades, nuclear missile silos and satellites still operational.  Yet a radio station playing on loop confuses you?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs crazy that just bc a teammate does something wrong they can kill you which causes you to lose caps/junk even tho you did nothing wrong. Was on a team the other day and my teammate accidentally hit someone‚Äôs base and to make a long story short I ended up being killed twice and losing a total of 180 caps even tho I did absolutely nothing wrong. Stupidest idea I‚Äôve ever seen in a video game.
---
The hate is well-deserved tho
---
No, they dont. Not good mods, anyway.
---
All the best Oblivion quests - Verona House, Lost Spires, Heart of the Dead - were mods.
---
i do it by accident of course. Although i would like to have those beer steins i mentioned in my house and its unfortunate i cant decorate with them
---
I've only joined SBQ fights about a dozen times and twice I've witnessed this.  She goes down maybe a 1/5th or a 1/4  and then ceases to take damage.  I always chalked it up to the entirety of the low level folks on the server with zero DPS entering the cell; but I can't back that up. 
---
What‚Äôs annoying to me is the people that look for anything positive about 76, and then go and bash it. For instance, yesterday I posted a screenshot I took on imgur and it was immediately met with scorn and derision by the people who love to call 76 a ‚Äúcash grab‚Äù with no originality whatsoever. 
---
You know why this is? The game‚Äôs audience has diverged into two separate bases; those who enjoy the hell out of it, and those who were so put off by the first week of BETA (or what they read about it) that now they spend the time they would have spent playing looking for things to bash. 
---
76 is just FUN. Last night I found someone whose base was just a stone‚Äôs throw from mine, went to check it out and he had almost the exact same outfit as me. BoS combat armor, military cap, BoS underarmor... but mine was soldier, and his was officer. He immediately made me an officer underarmor and upgraded it to resistant. I‚Äôm level 90+ and people higher than me can still find something cool to make me, I was blown away. 
---
"You're" - don't we have a 'bot for this?
---
My dad died before video games were invented.
---
I'm ghoul... need a molerat!
---
Fair point, it's hard to pvp in a pve oriented game.
---
I don't even bother with it, because it just makes you feel like a  prick.
---
I died due to my own stupidity.  I wasn't complaining that he took my loot.  It's part of the game.  I just wanted to make sure he paid for it - using another part of the game.  :)
---
Healing Factor pretty much negates the regular slap damage if not in combat.  If the person is using something explosive, or has OD'd on bobbleheads, then it wouldn't matter what I had on.
---
You do know most of those monsters (like the mirelurk queen) are already/always dead right?  During the normal quest you encounter scorched and a Scorchbeast. The bodies of various species are also dead (and lootable for meat!) All through there.
---
they've already invested too much time and effort into this horrible game :(
---
I would be ok seeing the ability to gain legendary material through scraping legendary items.  The problem is this would just solidify the current endgame inability to move away from WhiteSpring and Prime nuke drops.
---
Handmade Rifle all the way. They do good dmg with almost no recoil, but more importantly, they are just plain Sexy!
---
Fine.
---
Let people who enjoy play on PVP servers. The rest can have PVE only mode.
---
Win/win.
---
:D I love my Harbor Freight and "quality" imports from China. I have gotten some great deals... and been burned more than once. I got a dial indicator with the extra long stylus for $100 and it was quite a keeper. Also bought a tenths horizontal indicator with four different mounting dovetails for under $100. 
---
I had a mod on FO4 that scrapped a legendary item into legendary mod, so there‚Äôs no abuse of legendaries items.
---
Now I got a wood, leather, combat, robot and a marine armor on (all legendary), so wouldn‚Äôt be nicer if it were all combat armor for instance?
---
I REALLY hope they keep updating him as the game goes on with new voice lines. 
---
I had to draw the ghouls towards him at first but once he got involved, fun times
---
Help yourself, neighbor. Just keep yer stanky ass hands off my clean sheets and we'll be fine.
---
Griefers are an easily addicted demographic, which is why publishers enable them.
---
If I didn't want people to use them, I would lock them
---
Did you ever see what unusual hats would go for before TF2 added the pay market? I remember one dude spent like $1500.00 for a rare unusual soldier's hat, the samurai one. 
---
I couldn't believe he would pay that money for a cosmetic item.
---
Apparently!
---
Great tip there. I have in the past even resorted to taking a picture with my phone of my tv.  There should be a way to use social media integrations to post the images out of the gallery for console users imo.
---
That's valid actually. Didn't think of that. 
---
I remember building up a workshop after an attack and hearing him grumbling. Chased him down the street. Was just like that. I imagined breathlessly fumbling my change at the roadside, excited to buy myself a treat...
---
Or a chicken.  And it grows into a mutated raptor that you can mount.  Is that asking for too much?
---
He‚Äôs trying to buy them, not selling them 
---
sadly, knowing how the game works is simple its the stopping the leechers from coming is the hard part.
---
I think my own testing led me to believe it was for scoped shots outside of VATs.    
---
I had much better success with VATS accuracy by changing scopes from short to long. Although this makes close range ADS outside of VATs somewhat trickier :D 
---
Even if he became wanted again, it wouldn't make any difference with zero caps.
---
I have done the event twice and got the plans both times so either I have great luck or you have really bad luck!
---
If plans were account based and not character locked, I'd be more willing to make another character. 
---

---
No, Rose keeps sending you to your death and mocking you for it.
---
I've noticed this seems to be a problem with pieces that have natural rad resistance. The armors value seems to just overwrite the +25 instead of adding to it. 
---
k? either look at the website or not. 
---
LOL at that bit about displaying cool weapons that are 5 levels too high...   I'll add, I'd love to display those goto weapons that aren't legendary but helped you slog through 25 levels (like a level 20 pipe revolver) those are the REAL legendaries to me.
---
Im on xbox, I find I have v low frames for good minute upon loading.  Also I dont move or do anything during this as that has good chance of freezing it up entirely.  Once I get smooth frames Im ok to play.  Nightmare if in a rush.
---
They already exist, they're called the Free States.
---
If on Xbox that might have been me.
---
I was sneaking and saw the station.  Then caution turned to danger so I ran for the train station to unlock it.
---
Next thing I know there are robots firing everywhere inside the train station.  I died twice helping clean up my mess.
---
Well, 10 minutes of irl time is 3.33 hours of in-game time and I probably drink 12-16 oz of water in that time in real life. And I'd drink even more if I was constantly out running all over the countryside all day. Food consumption is probably a bit over the top though.
---
I guess, Bethesda does not really understand what a pacifist is and what people want as a pacifist.
---
There should be really a seperate server, where PvP is disabled, completely.
---
And RP-Servers. This game could be really cool with a RP-Server.
---
You have a lot of faith in Bethesda. I just hope they see their... let's call it failure, as motivation to bring some true magic in this game. If anything, to please the playerbase and repair their to bits blown reputation.
---
 It's one of the daily missions, called Ecological Balance, which you can trigger by going to Tygart water treatment plant near Summersville. (near the middle of the map)
---
There you can find a trailer with a terminal. Listen to the  holotape on the desk and you're off on a brand new adventure ;-)
---
This one does too for those not blind and deaf to it. Leave the Forest and you might see some of that Wasteland you‚Äôre missing. 
---
Normally I criticize PVP, and "raiding" as it's mostly done by people willing to spend insane amount of time and money in effort to be powerful. In this case you sound so whiny that I'm very hard pressed to side with you.
---
You don't like PVP? Don't take workshops. Simple.
---
Oh! And Prickett's fort yields around 150 wood every visit. Cook away!
---
Those are not the Handmade plans
---
better stairs, yes please. Nice looking wooden ones or a spiral staircase.
---
Last week it was on thursday so maybe then?
---
Their armour piercing rounds are a real pain.
---
They can criticize on their channel then. Not on this sub every single day for months.
---
I've said this since the announcement of "The Slap System".  Epic fail.  Did anyone at BGS whiteboard this idea?  At all?  A simple 2 minute review would (or should) have killed this system.  Players that want to PvP (like myself) are reduced to running around shooting rando's to 'test' if they're interested.  It annoys them to no end and ruins their experience while simultaneously annoying me and ruining my experience.  Whereas if there was a 'flag' system or PvP/PvE servers, neither party would have to deal with this nonsense.
---
As to the workshops, perhaps they could be PvP designated areas on PvE servers (obviously all areas are PvP on a PvP server) or you are flagged when entering the buildable area of a workshop.
---
The system that BGS currently has in place is HORRIBLE.  There's no incentive to PvP (other than to annoy players--particularly those that don't wish to engage) and there is alot of disincentive.
---
Weapon/damage balance is an entirely different issue--one that is far more difficult to address.  As the game stands, even if they had segregated servers, PvP is lame with the proliforation of TSE weapons (thanks dupers) and trading one shots on each other.
---
He didn‚Äôt say nukacrypt wasn‚Äôt doing the same thing, he just said he preferred enclave DB. You don‚Äôt have to be toxic. Why are you so triggered
---
Can we all please upvote this to oblivion( or atleast its developers).
---
Yeah I had these issues for a few days. I found out using the same method you stated above is the only thing that works for me. Opening the pip boy freezes it every single time. If I wait then it all works out 
---
you need this: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Faschnacht_Man_mask
---
Did you bust down my keypad door and bust up my furniture last week?
---
I had to memorize a new passcode after that.
---
It takes 5 seconds, just check it before hitting "play"
---
It's designed to fit around a human arm and fist. Power armor is too big.
---
What they really need is a mod for power armor that turns the end to a power fist. 
---
I like how even when they get the game for free they decide to still bandwagon the hate even though they know they‚Äôve played very little of it.
---
What do we expect, though? These are the same people who bashed Activision for selling a shitty reticle for fifty cents. What kind of YouTube-milking  asshole has to stretch the minor news of a reticle being sold for fifty cents to twelve minutes? ‚ÄúFighting for gaming‚Äù my ass. You‚Äôre milking the system just as much as your ‚Äúdespised corporations‚Äù are.
---
I just want a list if plans I already own or some indicator of ‚Äúyou already know this idiot‚Äù when I‚Äôm at a vendor, TBH. 
---
Don't watch the videos and just downvote them.  That's what I do.
---
It's more durable, I've seen some YTuber made experiment with every building set - throwing grenades and smashing with melee - wooden and barn are weakest, warehouse and brick more durable while metal is the strongest.
---
Im taking about plans to modify the gun not to build it.   I've never seen plans,  either to build it or modify until after this patch. 
---
How do you get so many atoms? It takes me like an hour to get 60.
---
oh I meant to add that! Thanks. 
---
I did duck into the shack a couple of times to pop radaway and stim and just breath for a moment. But it was never more than about 30 seconds. 
---
Unfortunately my game crashed when the queen was at about half health, so I don't know if they killed it. 
---
On a semi related note: What level should I be when I go for my first launch. I've got the quest "I Am Become Death". I've got my key card. I haven't started working on code pieces yet because I know those are time limited. 
---
Before you thow the "hoarding" word you should really define what "playing the game" is. Ignoring 90% of the game to bypass the issue is not the perfect solution you make it out to be. What's the point of workshops if you must only kerp 50 of each material and throw the rest. You can't even keep different types of bullets in case you find a cool new weapon. You need to hoard thousents of steel, gunpowder and lead too keep up the ammo on some fast fireing weapons. Just because you found a loophole in your playstyle where you bypass 90% of the optional gameplay doesn't mean everyone wsnts to play that way.
---
Here's a piece from my favorite little book of wisdom. It's a little long and preachy for a video game reddit post, but bear with me:
---
*Know What You Can Control and What you Can't*
---
Happiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one principle: some things are within our control, and some things are not. It is only after you have faced up to this fundamental rule and learned to distinguish between what you can and can't control that inner tranquility and outer effectiveness become possible.
---
Within our control are our **own opinions**, aspirations, desires, and the things that repel us. These areas are quite rightly our concern, because they are directly subject to our influence. We always have a choice about the contents and character of our inner lives.
---
Outside our control, however, are such things as what kind of body we have, whether we're born into wealth or strike it rich, how we are regarded by others, and our status in society. We must remember that those things are externals are are therefore not our concern. Trying to control or to change what we can't only results in torment.
---
Remember: the things within our power are naturally at our disposal, free from any restraint or hindrance; but those things outside our power are weak, dependent, or determined by whims and actions of others. Remember, too, that if you think that you have free reign over things that are naturally beyond your control or if you attempt to adopt the affairs of others as your own, your pursuits will be thwarted and you will become a frustrated, anxious, and fault finding person.
---
Interpret it as you will. There's other relevant excerpts in here but this seems like a good place to start lol.
---
You have a choice, and your friend has a choice. You cannot make a choice for someone else. If your friend trusts a youtuber more than you, then you should probably drop some points in Charisma. 
---
False, people are stacking bobbleheads and killing people without them retaliating.
---
I actually didn't know that as I never ran the BoS quests with my main, just the Enclave ones. Fuck that guy then. Lol
---
At first it might happen once a week.  Now, it's happening in about 30% of the fights.  Over half you can see someone stacking but not super high... chunking off 20% of her health at a time.  But, in about 30% of the ones I did this weekend, someone one come in and one shot her.
---
It‚Äôs not just cosmetic. Metal wall takes the most damage before breaking. I don‚Äôt know the exact values though 
---
Chainsaw, think about it, with the mods and having it upgraded to 200%, it does about 30 something damage per second. Doesn‚Äôt sound like a whole lot, but it‚Äôs actually amazing. Give it a try sometime. 
---
shhhhh they need to bitch
---
Might seem kinda simple, but The Baseball Bat. Something about one hitting enemies in the dome makes me smile. 
---
Can do perk (which I use all the time for canned coffee) nets a lot of canned dog food. The trash cans at whitesprings alone are nothing to sneeze at. I'm up to 150+ dog food, 100+ purified water, 100+ canned coffee. 
---
Casually finding 40 for a night of gameplay seems pretty reasonable, a lot of players don't bother to pick these up. That and hydration in my impression seems to go down two or three times faster than food.
---
I already gave in long ago and bought the weapons I wanted with caps. Still need that perfect armour set, though at this rate I could be playing for years and not even have one of the five pieces I'm looking for.
---
week before was wednesday, before that it was tuesday.
---
To sum up, you want:
---
- More powerful standard weapons
---
- Less powerful standard enemies
---
- Enemies that can be tanked by friends
---
- Enemies that maintain ranged distance
---
- Almost negligible survival needs
---
- Almost negligible upkeep costs
---
The PvP is a joke honestly, but it‚Äôs fun to play with friends. It‚Äôs just annoying when people abuse it.
---
Grahm saved me from a bunch of mole miners and a glowing one. What a nice guy. 
---
If you want the Excavator mod plans, go to Camden Park and server hop.
---
You should remove your tin foil hat. Not everyone is up to something
---
Lower level solo players will die..a LOT. I think it's like this to encourage team play. Even 2 players working together can accomplish a lot more than trying it solo.   
---
Stay away from certain areas around the Whitespring (golf place) until you have a team and a strategy to take care of those ghouls.  
---
Gatling gun, the dragon takes second.
---
I just like the artifact look they have
---
You can also drop a water purifier into the river. Its right on the edge of the workshop's boundary.  Only problem is it's further away from everything else and can be a pain to defend. I don't do it much anymore, but I mainly used to claim this workshop for free fast travel so I could farm black titanium from nearby Deathclaw Island.
---
They work the same in 4 just takes a bit of skill and persistence to do it
---
Always drop a trash item like food or something.  Then check if bag appeared.
---
Then if it did, transfer items into the bag.
---
I will also find containers in the world to transfer my unwanted stuff.  If I accidentally transfer an item I can get it back.  Also maybe someone finds my trash before it disappears.
---
They fix the glitch with power cores filling up when players log into a server wearing power armor benefiting players but didn‚Äôt fix this bag not appearing glitch that hurts us.
---
I would rather they leave in the bugs that benefit us players until they fix all of these bugs that really hurt us.
---
Traders are usually overencumbered 
---
Yes you just pasted all that basically admitting that it's a thing you can't control.   IE, no choice.  So what is your point exactly?
---
That's funny because I've never had this issue until this patch! I have heard of patches fixing some issues for some and creating them for others. We are so close to having a truly unique and awesome game and honestly I've started thinking the crashes and bug-outs as part of Appalachia's cruelty and treating it as part of the role play. "just sank all my gears into claiming that fusion core generator and immediately disconnect? That's life out here in the wasteland. Time to make a supply run and hope for better luck on the next go 'round". I play solo 90% of the time and the un-knowing of weather my progress will be pulled from beneath me at any moment adds to the danger of wasteland life. It makes the successes that much sweeter. 
---
if your materials are split between whats on you, and whats in your stash, it won't let you craft.
---
this one works perfectly and it's easy to install: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214)
---
I also have an unarmed mutated build and I love it. One thing that really irks me though is hit detection. Sometimes I'm right in an enemies face and hit them 2 or 3 times and it doesnt register the hit even though its OBVIOUSLY a hit. Do you ever have this kind of problem or is it something with my personal connectivity?
---
lmao....toxic, triggered, any other overused hype words you want to add into there?
---
And while they are at it, how about putting an asterisk or something on a plan denoting that we have already read or know the plan!  I hate not remembering which plan I've read or gotten at the vendor's.
---
I made a new character and have found more/better plans than I did the first run. Mostly because the ones that spawn in the world, in the open, are less likely to have been looted recently than they were when everyone was still grabbing every plan they could find. I found several in the lodges outside top of the world I never knew existed until yesterday. 
---
it's a bad game, unfortunately.
---
anything else YOU wanna add? clearly this bothers u
---
Video game journalists*
---
I've seen that one. I'm not an PC. woah is me. 
---
Sure~ i think its actually called Martial Artist, but you'll know the skill by its effects, i believe it has 3 levels, peaks at level 3, so worth it to take there. 
---
I'm level 6 and I randomly met a high level guy who immediately asked if I needed plans, dropped some, asked me if I needed water, took me to his baller as fuck CAMP, showed me around, helped me on  a quest to start the Poseidon reactor (I died at the end) and then we parted ways.  This is the first online RPG I've ever played and it was like I met a real life "mysterious stranger".
---
So I guess that's one thing you can do.
---
Somehow I managed to get the disco ball but I never had the plan? I'm assuming it was from another plan.
---
I have a couple of TSE weapons that i was trawling through whitesprings with in passive. Got owned a few times by a guy level 60, bearing in mind i am level 156. I took passive off, tried getting some caps back, but ny weapons were near useless. I was doing literally 1/20th of his health var damage with my handmade TSE (488 damage). Anyone explain his ridiculous damage output and lack of damage to him? 
---
Aw, that must have been crushing.  Emotionally and physically. 
---
Or maybe it was designed with the perks in mind? They always seem to be good at solving problems. It‚Äôd be like someone not taking damage perks then whining about how enemies are too bullet spongy. Lol
---
Idk, they have their points and i would say overall they are good for the industry. Bethesda does still have a lot of work to do with how they launched the game. And there were also many signs that pointed to it going free to play, and not only that bethesda gave a very vague weird response to it. I wouldnt be surprised at all of the game went free to play within the next 6 months- a year after the first big content updates come out and sales start to slow down again
---
So this week Friday?
---
Wait, is this the brahmin pen you get from the brahmin pen plan? I thought that was only for workshops? 
---
I'm gonna go with Friday then. Thats the pattern 
---
In an emergency you can always go back to Whitespring and drink from the sulphur fountain.
---
I found the key on the corpse at the digger. There was a manikin and they were on deck chairs on the digger. To know you have the right tunnel, when at the construction buildings, there is a platform that leads between two of the rooms and runs parallel to to the wall. Below it is a big passage, follow it to see. This is also the way to get one of the codes. 
---
Ive been attacked once in the last 100hrs of game play. These guys have one lame experience and they flip their lids. Making it sound like people are just griefing non stop. 
---
man look at how triggered you are. 
---
For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life, but for me, its was tuesday.
---
I had a level 20 demand a trade from me. I shrugged and stood there then he started whacking me with an axe.
---
I ended up chasing him with a vampiric mr handy saw blade and took my chipped hp back then stole his shit
---
Personally, I just play the game as I always do and happen to complete whatever random daily ATOM achievements. Supposedly there's a way to look up the daily goals in the game menu but I honestly haven't checked. Just yesterday I got one for landing multiple crits on an enemy and another for destroying some number of different types of robot. I also go one for taking a photo at night while wearing a helmet. It just happens lol. 
---
QED. i‚Äôm not going to argue with kids. 
---
Well I play the game 2 lvl 115+ characters. They don't lie about the game they do report on rumors that may not be true. But yeah your just mad ppl don't like a game you love. I hate redditors that pretend fallout 76 isn't a completely broken empty mess.
---
Can‚Äôt blame them really. At the moment there‚Äôs little to bring players together organically, and make interactions feel natural. You have to be a somewhat extroverted person to role play as there are no clearly defined roles to begin with. 
---
Quad hunting rifle. Becouse it is hardcore to kill muties, but i loook fabulous with that camoo rifle you cant see.
---
If I did, I don't think I'd have the heart to loot from Grahm.
---
The mods have always been available at high levels. 
---
The "Handmade Plans", which is literally what they are called and what you wrote in your title, are the plans to build the gun itself and are what people want because they are only available up to a certain level.
---
I keep my purifiers unlocked so people can help themselves. Honestly tho, the big neon letters I put up saying "Free Water" probably clues people into that.
---
It was, I was hoping it was him lol, it got worse a lvl 71 chameleon deathclaw turned up just as I was approaching them lol
---
if you wanted to be pedantic, whitesprings could be considered correct as well. The resort is located in white sulpher springs, so it's a shortened version of that.  
---
Yea, i've thought about this too much lately, lol.  
---
I dont mind the bashing much. 
---
What annoys me is the claim that there is something wrong with this sub because were fairly positive about things.  They act surprised that a fan sub is filled with fans of the game and not haters. Why would we even be here if we didn't like the game at least a bit? You dont show up in the..iunno.. Sailor Moon reddit and be surprised that the people ther LIKE Sailor Moon!
---
But apparently that makes us a circle jerk.
---
It's not about finishing the quest but about looting the supply drop that another player requested, should you happen upon one.
---
Unfortunately, I don't remember when exactly the quest finished for me and my friend (whether it was enough to approach the crate or we needed to interact with it). The area marker was certainly still there after the other player stole them. 
---
A Furious Board.
---
In essence, like Fallout 4?    
---
Where each Perk is associated with a character and SPECIAL level? That would be great. You could easily create and play many types of builds.
---
The F2P stuff was definitely just click bait BS.
---
The dev room is a thing though.  Yeah its a dev feature, and yeah its been in previous game.  Previous SINGLE PLAYER games.
---
A vast majority of the problems that 76 has faced is a direct result of Bethesda being extremely casual about the fact this is a persistent multiplayer game.  There are certain things that have to be done differently to preserve a online community to ensure it is not permanently damaged with regard to the player base and economy.  They have failed to do that repeatedly.
---
The dev room problems could have been avoided simply by ensuring a release build doesn't include the room on live servers.
---
Why does there NEED to be a post about youtube every day on here? You people THAT insecure?
---
Didn't know about this, but after watching 2 of his videos recently about FO76 you can tell from his mannerisms and the way he interacts with his camera that he was narcissistic, vile and full of shit. Not above lying and making "news" up for the benefit of clicks, subs and in the end ¬£$'s. but on top of that turns out he's a bully....the worst sort as well a cyber bully :/
---
You tube should delete his account tbh, at the moment all he does if give people genuinely interested in journalism / gaming channels on you tube a bad name.
---
the topic of this particular thread started out with a comment specifically about marsupial, so no.
---
however since you are concerned about spending points, most people end up with multiple mutations (marsupial, speed demon, healing factor) so if that is your plan, spending two points for starched genes is giving you all kinds of benefits above and beyond the extra carry weight.
---
Let me put it this way.  You can choose how to react to your friend but you can not choose to not be affected.  Your affected by your friend not playing no matter what you do.  You can choose not to care, and dismiss your friend.  Either way, your life was actually affected and perhaps the friendship.  This is an example obviously but I love the downvotes. Keep em comming.
---
Stuff like this is why this game never should have been online in the first place. I don‚Äôt want to spend my time back peddling just to make sure I clean up ‚Äúmy‚Äù enemies for other players.. that makes it seem like a chore. I definitely don‚Äôt want to spend my time escorting someone else just so they can survive. Some people enjoy doing stuff like that, I‚Äôm not one of them. Call me what you will but Bethesda either needs to stick to single player or come up with better ways to balance the game. Plain &amp; simple.
---
It's also affected the elevator in one of the mining Estates to the south. It dumps you into a robot spawn room instead of staying inside of the elevator on an upper floor. At least you can still explore the Estate, though.
---
I maxed strength and dont carry junk. 
---
Yup. I seem to need enough mats to craft/repair at least TWO of an item before I can craft/repair one. That is, if I need 4 aluminum to make something, I need at least 8 aluminum.
---
I disagree. But I like that you spend your life putting a game down that you don't like to others that do. 
---
I would cheerfully trade the 36 prewar bills for like 3 ammo what do I need 36 cloth for ?
---
you can have multiple mutations :)
---
Pretty sure you all have to be on that quest for it to progress. It won't count if you yourself aren't on the mission.
---
Just over 60 and I'll go in with my 2 shot gatling and just work the adds.  
---
I'll throw rounds at the queen if shes on the ground and my area is clear.  
---
I do try to stay out in the open unless I need to swap something with a teammate, like ammo.
---
Ah, the old [mutant-aroo]( https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/aiwwan/husband_vs_wife_reading_material/eerkw7j/?context=1 )

I ran into him for the first time the other night in Charleston. Nice surprise...

"Hello friend! I'm going door to door to make you this INCREDIBLE offer!"
---
\*hands tinfoil\*
---
Help yourself buddy 
---
nah, not only are they well aware of what it does, the game has features designed specifically for it.
---
i find all sorts of interesting things on rooftops only accessible via Marsupial or Jetpack.
---
I‚Äôll buy those emergency protocol off you if your xbox 
---
There will never be a SBQ killed again. If you think griefing is an issue now, just wait until a horde of pimply faced raiders in the area (not helping with the queen) wait until you're at 20% health to one shot you constantly.
---
For now, a combat shotgun with mode damage to ghouls. and a simple single shot explosive pipe gun.
---
^this, always do a test item for the bag first. me and my friends can‚Äôt even count how many times we lost shot cause the bag wasn‚Äôt even there
---
I usually get them by scrapping murdering or doing events.  Have used 3600 so far.  Yesterday I bought the fireplace.  Back up to 700 already 
---
I'm sure you will soon!
---
Haha, reminds me of the other night, when my friends and I were just messing around and getting bounties. Myself and another were just running around in our underwear, this dude in Ultracite armor shows up, kills my bud, and I sneak up to him and stay within those two inches for a couple minutes, wailing on him with a chainsaw.
---
Anyone that has ever used a chainsaw knows it is utter shit. It'll be hours before you kill someone with it, lol. But this guy was rocking a tse explosive and kept trying to get away from me to use it. Speed Demon mutation wouldn't let that happen. Eventually, he got enough room and killed me but it was hilarious. If I was actually rocking a good melee weapon or pulled out my two shot non-explosives, he would've been toast. Lesson for bounty hunters: if you use tse, always have a back up non-explosive weapon for close quarters.
---
Haha I wanted to get in on this,  I had someone use the lore argument on me the last time this got posted .. So like two days ago ? Lol. Seriously,  If you were locked in a vault with the people in this thread...  tell me you wouldnt want to off someone.
---
Ps people upvoting or down voting doest mean jack. It in no way shape or form means you are right or they are wrong necessarily 
---
Well, at least you have wood.

are y‚Äôall done jerking each other off
---
I love how people have made a mountain out of a molerat hill here. I saw 1, a single youtube video where the guy was upfront that this was pure speculation and that there was no solid evidence whatsoever.
---
But everyone is quick to act like this youtuber was intentionally spreading misinformation and misleading peopler.
---
Retreat!!!
---
That rolled through my camp once, too.  It was straight up confusing at first.
---
She needs an instant kill aoe the size of the nuke zone that zaps people under lvl 45 and armor that deflects their bullets so they can't get tags. Sounds mean but they are making the fight impossible anyway.
---
Are there any studies into whether VATS even works properly at all?
---
I've got an exterminators explosive shot gun that hits anything I point it at but when I go into VATS with it I only hit my target 1/3 shots.
---
I'll take one St. Bernard, please.
---
I would love to see DOgs as well even different animals they should be available as a defense in your camp build. Idk if it‚Äôll work as a traveling companion in this game but it‚Äôll be cool

Ignore them and can you block streams?  If so block them so they don't pop up on your feed.  They have no voice if they have no viewers.

Didn't know there was coal there, good to know!

Never going to happen. FO4/previous games didn‚Äôt have this therefore it will not be implemented. Will require massive additional work hours to tweak this.

Because we understand that running and fighting for survival and taking Stims and Radaway deplete one‚Äôs hydration and calories rather more quickly than a sedentary 21st century lifestyle.

I think he is saying "if you are going to summon the sbq make sure the server isn't 90% low level players."
---
Lol, nothing wrong with you using those stupid terms, but the minute they are used against you.....nope, now it's immature and the person must be a "kid." The latin acronym is a nice touch for asserting your maturity and intellect. 10/10 trolling, bravo fine sir.

I'm 97 and I still find new places to explore.  2 of them last night had very angry very hard 3 star deathclaw.  Who knew that cave called hope well cave would have such a vicious occupant.  It might look like a skull I might have been under the impression it was a random rock formation 
---
I met him constantly when I was low level and had 20 caps to my name.  Now that I have money he's a ghost, I think I hear his faint noises and then no matter how far or fast I run he just fades away to nothing.
---
Oh nice. Sorry you didnt get more upvotes!
---
yes while keeping the random perk packs, the cards visuals, and the card fusion for upgrading perks.
---
It ends cause someone deleted their comment. It ends at the chemo therapy post 
---
I wonder if this is why so many players have never met him.  Perhaps he's often stuck somewhere.  His route is huge and probably filled with potential for it.
---
Yupper processing power sounds better than storage. The actual existence and creation of the item probably does not take up a lot of space,  the processing power to use that item when someone is in the world with all of its fancy legendary affects would definitely bog it down. I'm sure a two shot explosive handmade takes it the same room as an anti-armor hunters handmade but actually using the two shot explosive takes much more processing power thanks to all the added fun features ‚úäüèΩ 
---
If you upgraded a perk card you already had equipped in that stat slot it will sometimes keep the card equipped so you would not see a new slot open.
---
No plans required. Just put your camp near any resource deposit in the ground,and you can put an extractor on it
---
They‚Äôre fixing it dummy. Two modes already announced.

 YOURE STILL GOING. do u have anything better to do? i can‚Äôt entertain you

Fast traveled from Top of the World train station to Whitesprings train station, stuck on load screen for 10+ minutes, finally gave up and force closed the game.
---
PvP in this game is downright poorly implemented. No, it's not just that the implementation is poor it's that the way pvp is implemented is confused. It's as if the developers didn't know what they were supposed to be doing with the pvp feature and so what we ended up with is this pile of garbage with no clear intent that leaves no one, not pvper's nor pve'ers happy.
---
ahhh the good 'ol days of the Diablo 3 real money auction house
---
Ah, so that's why the bot said it didnt work.
---
Not sure how to fix this tbh
---
I've seen that base a while ago in-game. Idk if it was you but thanks for playing banjo with me.
---
The referenced video showed that there was a 1:3:4 ratio in durability between wood, brick and steel walls. 
---
I don‚Äôt think we can. 
---
also engineer has a back pack type item
---
Yes, it's the same.  Under resources in your C.A.M.P it looks like a wheelbarrow but drops in the brahmin too.  You just need razorgrain and fertilizer, if I remember correctly, to rez it.
---
Seems like just am empty husk to me... a well designed world with no content. 
---
You're the only one here saying you don't have a choice. Don't let youtube or your friend's misguided opinion affect you. That's your choice.
---
That's something I have been doing I'll usually look around the map in the lower level areas to hook people up. Mostly it's me just cleaning up inventory, I'll build full sets of armor and drop em off and sometimes we'll go and do some missions together but even then it gets a bit boring after a while.
---
It's pretty easy to do a low-effort run through there, if you've completed the Brotherhood portion of the main quest. Sometimes I'll do Line in the Sand out front, scoop up the junk on the way to the elevator, go up to level 3 for the junk and workbenches there, and then up to level 4 for the junk there. 
---
They are and they aren't. Our governor owns the Greenbriar. But see that's what I'm talking about. White sulphur springs is the name of the city and greenbriar is the name of the resort. Just like summerville is nowhere near where it really is in relation to Charleston. But yeah if it resembles something it'll pass for it.
---
seriously though why are these always on different days and vague as can be? Every week its disappointing "oh we'll be working on some stuff we arent mentioning that will come out sometime soon!"
---
It happens often enough to where I get frustrated because I normally run through the nuclear silo by myself and then to launch on the queen and not be able to take damage on her is kind of booboo. I normally like to wait up by my camp to watch the nuke drop and take a cool picture, now I wait right near ground zero in order to ensure I get a shot. üòÇüôèüèº
---
Well, shit, I didn't know that. Imma have to take a gander when I get home. 
---
Yeah, I mean, I grabbed the newest switcharoo and everything.
---
I'll see if the mods in switcharoo can do anything
---
Why do people keep calling this PvP? It's not. Only one person is participating and they are attacking someone that does not want to be involved. If it happens at my wife's elementary school they call it bullying and suspend the brat.
---
I really do not think the upcoming PvP mode will solve anything since these people are not interested in fighting other players, just attacking and ambushing people that will not (or cannot) defend themselves
---
He must‚Äôve had sentinel armor (another major problem that needs to be nerfed). It negates Explosive weapons because it practically makes you invincible unless someone uses a high rate of fire weapon or a MIRV Fat Man. If they stand still and their AP is high you won‚Äôt kill them. The armor increases your damage resistance if you don‚Äôt move.
---
Not possible. The game does not tag your equipment and progress like that.
---
Being brutally honest dogmeat always ran out in the open and pulled all the melee people into a nice big pile....perfect for a plasma grenade....and I took advantage of that shamelessly....~~A LOT~~  never
---
Let me know if anyone finds a socketed heavy combat armor chest piece. I'm gonna put the enigma runeword in it. 
---
More likely they're downvoting because "this game isn't about minmaxing, stop rushing, stop trying to be a killing machine, just accept whatever drops and stop asking for more"
---
Good to know though when I need to go back there for Ultracite to fix my Ultracite Power Armor, the entire reason I'm doing this questing for her. 
---
I've nope out of over half the qeeun fights I've been in because after ten minutes her health hasn't moved a quarter of an inch. I feel like it is always a combination of low lvl players and people standing on top of buildings and other weird shit so she never lands.
---
I can offer secondary confirmation. The Watoga robots do not take kindly to either Pheonix or the RR trapped bot.
---
Everyone needs to have the quest you are doing, and you each need to do every step. So for instance if you need an item from a container, there will be one instance of that item for every person in the group. Need to kill a certain enemy, everyone need sto get credit for the kill, need to interact with something, each person needs to do it, etc
---
i feal like it is just the old dj play list when there was one or some nice soul set it up for the survivors had some music so they would not go nuts in their home made bunkers and such  
---
I'd imagine invitations to events are not about saying positive things or the game press wouldn't be invited but more about not being a toxic asshat.
---
YouTubers now actively use their toxicity as a badge of authenticity to their viewer base. Hell one video I watched last night actually said just that.
---
The thing is in a race to be more and more toxic and outlandish is a race they will lose as more people become more virulent to fight to maintain a piece of the hardcore gamer base. 
---
Basically by being quiet and letting the YouTubers spew rumor and unsubstantiated and easily debunked shit Beth is letting them slowly dig their own irrelevancy graves.
---
Yessir. A trap. I threw a short video up on my booboo YouTube channel. Good little walkthough without commentary of how to run a small trap. It killed a level 2 and level 44 before the update with fire proof so it may take a few more fire nozzles üò≠‚úäüèΩ
---
It's not just with armors with their own inherent rad resist, though - since I've had it on a BOS Combat piece as well.
---
Your affected by having to react to the situation at all.  So trying to act all high and mighty by saying people shouldn't be affected by YouTube reviews is blissful ignorance.  I don't personally care, but I do care about false statement getting upvotes all the time on this sub lol.  
---
Eh, I think the Wanted flag should remain longer on an account.  Like 8 hours or longer.  
---
or every twenty levels post 50 we got abother special point and raise the cap to twenty in each slot
---
Embrace the 3 star rolling pin!
---
I think you had a better explanation 
---
Don't fight them unless you're near one of those Brotherhood Surface-to-air Missile Systems
---
Pets or food...fucking Roger and me
---
Got 15 STR and every perk in there is for weight reduction. I agree, you have to choose between being a  tanky muke or a fighting machine
---
I‚Äôve noticed the same thing. I‚Äôve also received a confirmation email about the canvas bag being approved but will take a few months to be manufactured. 
---
The bad part is, where my camp is whenever I spawn in two mole rats always spawn in as well so they always attack me while I‚Äôm standing there not able to do anything and they always knock my health down to nothing before I can actually kill them without my game completely freezing.
---
But stay away from the Snallygasters. Those things are brutal.
---
It was really random, though. So, I'm not sure what made it reappear. I can at least say with certainty that it happens on pieces that don't have their inherent rad resist as well.
---
Same here
---
I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve tried to get that event to trigger, and have only had it happen once.  Drives me nuts.  
---
Do you have all of the rifle perks? A 137 damage rifle seems kinda weak for maxed out items. Also, please tell me you don‚Äôt main rifles while trying to kill a scorchbeast. It‚Äôs better to use a automatic combat rifle that has 70-ish damage per shot if your trying to kill enemies that hav tons of health. 
---
Shame that bethesda never bothered to spare even a sideways glance at the games that came before them to see how these other games handled the exact problems that Fallout 76 is currently suffering.
---
Fallout 76 is not innovative, it's not a pioneer in the genre, bethesda is late to the show on this so there is no reason they couldn't have looked at what Blizzard, Ubisoft, and Bungie did, rather than making the same mistakes.
---
I love doing that.
---
Yea, I got that. I think perhaps I interpreted the intent of the thread differently than they meant. It initially felt to me less like a PSA for not possibly screwing yourself over (which is now how I feel they intended) and more of a "let me tell you how i want you to launch nukes" tone. I'm used to seeing people cry about how others place nukes and the such, so that's prolly why I initially assumed this was the same, lol.  
---
Happens so much to me
---
I use Vats headshots when I‚Äôm getting swarmed.   Don‚Äôt notice it missing unless percentage is low. 
---
This would be great.  I have a few thousand atoms burning a hole into my pocket until the Raven skin becomes available again (please oh please)
---
You need the perk itself
---
Others have sl ready answered this but the latest f2p hubbub was whipped up by that quartering guy. It's a total feedback loop where someone says something on youtube, then some crappy gaming site writes a story based on that, then the tubers reference the story as truth. 
---
Can you use All Night Long Perk for it?
---
Even tse pump with 800writen dmg dont hurt them in air. They are nightmare enemy
---
I‚Äôve seen that happen on my unarmed build too, oddly not with melee. 
---
I'm a solo player level 115 and I Haven't launched a nuke yet and really don't care to fight my way through all of the robots and turrets solo to nuke the prime and have nobody show up, but I would like to get that mission cleared.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for one of these ever since I got the flamer mod a while ago now. Where did you find yours?
---
I like this idea. Also in order to prevent exploitation (people killing their pals over and over for exp) have there be a cooldown to the bonus.
---
Had some asshole in full sentinel armor trying to kill me. He kept taunting me with emotes.
---
Tossed a nuke cola grenade at him.
---
Thinking he was hot shit he ate the explosion. 
---
Little did he realize it‚Äôs not the blast that kills you it‚Äôs the radiation...
---
Its how you spend the 9 points.  6 points for 30% to a specific weapon is not worth it to me.  Spending them on bloody mess, tenderizer, adrenaline, vats or others just do more for me.  
---
How is it worse?  Weapon perk cards are added up then applied, bloody mess is applied after that.  
---
  100* 1.45 = 145  (3 perk cards.at 2 per)
---
  100 * 1.30 * 1.15 = 149 (3 perk cards.at 1 per, 3 BM)
---
If those other three.are used for other damage perks like gunfu, adrenaline, tenderizer, or vats it just ramps further.
---
As for damage resist, didn't see 76 on there, my recollection was basically bigger number suffer less.  
---
For giggles here is a quick discussion link, too busy at office to dig further for.what sounded like basics.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wd6hr/are_damage_perks_worth_it/
---
I've never seen this happen either and I try to run a few queens every weekend.
---
But only if vats does not target it
---
Yeah I got that as well but the fact that they can't automate or add the value to my account in a reasonable amount of time is a bit sad. I understand the time on the bag as they need to get the materials, get the design hammered out and get a manufacturer under to start production when their schedule allows.
---
They could take a place like the Green Country Lodge in Flatwoods, and let us rent out rooms. We could conquer Helvetia, or some of the other areas and take houses. Once we kill the Scorchbeast Queen, we should be able to move on to a server where we now have to clear the remaining Scorched and start taking back Appalachia. 
---
Then after a few months of letting players sort out the logistics of maintaining and building their communities, introduce a new threat. 
---
My guess is that they have plans to implement just about everything we can wish for and then some. It is in both their financial interest and players interest to maximize the game for the builders/decorators, hoarders, explorers, pvp'ers etc.
---
The question is not if but rather when.
---
If your ok with losing some pictures try clear your save data and clear your cache.  Helped me on xbox.

---
No one is unkillable. They have a huge advantage, which is to be expected from having a full set of some of the rarest armor in the game but after draining their AP or a simple stagger available with most melee and any weapon with the right perk and it‚Äôs insta death. Also standing still to pvp in a huge disadvantage in its own regard and cover, ranged, etc. can be used to outplay someone. I kill people ALL the time with assassin/sent and most people that complain about it wonder why standing in front of them with a tse shotgun doesn‚Äôt 1 hit them like they‚Äôre so used to.
---
Gt is MergedSpy93289 be happy to help
---
That will come with "factions DLC"
---
I can easily damage them with just a rifle... Shotguns don‚Äôt have range, so I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd try shooting in while it‚Äôs flying...
---
Perception that high means you really don‚Äôt miss much in Vats.  Luck that high means you basically crit on every other shot. 
---
Didn't found that
---
you can find it at a ranger station in the cranberry bog near bootleggers shack, and also at some bed and breakfast a little north of site charlie. 
---
sorry i don‚Äôt have specific names..but either way, those seem to be the top spots where they spawn in. hope i helped :) 
---
Who are the characters? Grahm the supermutant trader and...? Who else?
---
A fallout game with online elements? You can literally ONLY play the game online with other people.. so many people playing this game like the old fallout titles, when it's supposed to be different and bringing in new players. Don't really understand why people are buying a game that is online with other players only, advertised as PvP elements,  and then complaining about the multiplayer parts.. 
---
Depending on what is taking place, I would be frustrated by my inability to affect the other player, but I might not call it unfair. If they have a complete Assassin's set of gear and a few teammates running Empath, plus down a Med-X or something - yeah, that person is going to be ridiculous. But this isn't a switch that can just be flipped. You've got to get your team together, you have to find/purchase assassin's gear, etc. If a player puts in the work to make himself difficult for other players to kill - assuming no actual exploits like duping - then good on him.
---
Reddit tip: tagging someone's /u/ in a post doesn't notify them. It only works in a comment, and even then, only works for 3 or fewer usernames in a single comment. 
---
After a quick google, i cab't believe that is in the game?! That is such a setup. He purposely made himself wanted after killing me, to draw others in. I lost just short of 1000 caps from getting owned by him, as well as others getting killed by him. This game is bs sometimes.
---
Possible just spamming the stimpak button.? I know I do when shit happens.
---
Happens all the time when I'm in a team. Once went to give a buddy some .308 cause I don't use them dropped about 850 rounds and it didn't even show up. 
---
Becouse it can oneshot everything else on crazy distance.
---
I don‚Äôt think it will ever happen, as soon as you can pick up and place items people will start using them to clip through walls etc, this would be bad in a multiplayer game 
---
&gt; Its about the banjo on the roof of your shack over looking fisher prime. 
---
It's about looking at that shack and the 50-odd hours you put into it and thinking "Y'know, I want to move to the Ash Heap."
---
True story.
---
Says he isn't going to argue with kids. Continues to argue. Makes sense. 
---
I agree but I still get annoyed by people posting clickbait titles here on reddit and when you open it it is just a link to some youtube garbage.
---
Yep, it‚Äôs a really garbage thing about PvP which leads me back to why I made this post. Imagine a group of 4, no caps, and they all have that armor. I kill one or two and then they just keep coming back taking chunks off my base. It‚Äôs a problem.
---
It's one of many reasons why I don't like PvP. There are always exploits or builds that can allow someone who is more of an avid gamer to make in-game life miserable for someone who just enjoys the game. 
---
There are definitely builds that can allow a player to dish out huge amounts of damage while also minimizing the amount of damage he/she takes. 
---
Then add in the effects of prime and legendary weapons and it's pretty brutal for an average player. My suggestion would be to set yourself passive and log off if someone starts griefing you. It's possible for someone to one shot kill you, even if you're set passive. Especially if you inadvertently wander into a location where PvP is permitted and encouraged. 
---
I think that in your camp build area you should be able to attack other players without the slap or bounty and the guest players should still slap at first
---
still going, anything else you wanna get out your system? at this point i‚Äôm not arguing, just merely entertaining you. 
---
You guys aren‚Äôt bored of this game yet? Any suggestions on what to do?
---
Heavy weapons are the best for them
---
I say for balance purposes, have the perk card worth 2-3 points like Lone Wanderer. 
---
Bah, thanks for the heads up though!
---
I'm all for PvP, don't get me wrong; but I had my base leveled to pretty much nothing just because I had a 10 cap bounty on my head from accidentally hitting a current with my explosive weapons while defending someone's workshop. 
---
The base was fully metal with fusion generator and water purifiers. 
---
Did they really need to level my shit?
---
I saw a little while ago that if you get into a full group before you join a world that you'll join a fresh world.
---
I don't know if that's true though as everyone I knew that played quit playing as soon as I got the game.
---
I wasn't on a team and was getting wanted status during a whitesprings nuke run. I also have passive enabled. Ruined the game for me. 
---
Love how you get downvoted for truth and have ppl comment we don't have these problems yeah you in the minority cause everyone I see complains about the crashing and bugs to the point I think they're lying when they ppl say the don't. 
---
Just cause you haven't seen the ocean doesn't mean we aren't surrounded by it.
---
I actually didn't get the event to start the time I went to the penitentiary, tried once last night, but it was late so I didn't had the time to server jump to get it.
---
But man... I hope I am lucky as you.
---
Could call yourselves "The Insane Clown Faction".
---
Considering how utterly clueless last week's was,  I could stand to wait until Bugthesda actually wraps their heads around what's going on in their game. 
---
Flux is actually aids to carry it‚Äôs easy to get and collect but it weighs so much and you get too much of it, also BONE weighs a ridiculous amount
---
had two idiots try base griefing.... they didnt realize i had 6 missile turrets.... two less idiots griefing my base.
---
Contrary to the name, it doesn't actually come with a pen though. I had to construct my own.
---
So I‚Äôm missing something clearly... what does excavator armor do to increase the yield from the deposits?
---
War, war never changes
---
It seems to work fine on my auto rifle but my shotgun and melee are severely glitched. 
---
LOL.....there is no such thing as percentage with my shotgun. It's 100%.....just point and pull the trigger, except in VATS where it only hits a super mutant rushing you 10 feet away 1/3 times.
---
I don't do PvP and have given away a lot of assassin's armor. Didn't know it was a big deal. 
---
I dropper 1k ammo for my friend.  The bag didnt even spawn. It just all disappeared.  Also lost the storm legendary by dropping it accidentally.  :(
---
The first time I saw Grahm was in the whitesprings golf course. Hearing "You say Tato, I say Trado!" made me curious and I found the friendly green giant. I bought some ammo and plans off of him, and sold him like 600 gold clubs and skirts.
---
If you have a rifle build use a dragon with criticals. Thats probably your best bet.
---
/u/jessBethesda helped with an answer last time  
---
Why do Inside the Vaults never have a set day they come out? Also can we hope for some real info or is this one a vague "We're working on stuff we wont talk about!" again?
---
I get this is frustrating, but making passive mode into "un-influence-able god-character" is not the solution.
---
its also about grabbing as much nuka cola and becoming a nukacola salesman
---
This is likely the real answer. It's an investment.
---
Yea I hate rpg games that make the people stronger who play way more. So annoying, Pok√©mon is another good example. I wish everyone just had an ivory grip revolver so we could play the game as it‚Äôs meant to be played.
---
Ty I will check later
---
Then what do you propose Ethan?
---
This is excellent knowledge to share thank you 
---
God . I'm almost done with this sub. At least before there were different and meaningful posts. Now it's just the same group of people constantly reposting the same shit over and over and over and over and over .

Get a better weapon and/or build.

Even without a TSE I can kill standard scorchbeasts with ease.

I really don't use my TSE much,  because I refuse to waste perk space on fireproof. 
---
I use the whitesprings cooler on the safe spot ledge at the golf course for ammo dumping and unwanted legendary dumping. I figure anyone farming the spot could use ammo they're running low on and there might be something in there they could use.
---
Vendors empty out too quick
---
$60.00 game that has been at low as $30.00, sure, why not spend $150 on one singular item. 
---
Some people are too fucking stupid to have money. 
---
He was definitely using nuka colas he sent me a smartass video 
---
I found a 3* explosive, anti armor, +250 dr while reloading the other day.
---
Pull the trigger once and everything dies. +700 xp.
---
Because they are short range weapons...
---
&gt;and have to sit there and wait for it to recall.
---
If you target your standing PA, you should have an option to "Collect" it into your inventory.
---
every single run in whitesprings, 3* wood armor. why bethesda. why
---
300 hours in an no one has messed with my base. I have passive mode on and have never been killed with that activated. 
---
What exactly are you people doing that this is happening to you?
---
Is this like a console only sort of thing where everyone is an asshole?
---
Raider power armor will be the only PA that has a chance of spawning at level 15. With my two characters, I spent a little bit farming scorched in Morgantown. The airport, high school, and train yard are great for this. Pick up all their weapons, scrap em for steel and stuff, unlock useful mods (If you are using guns and not melee), and you should pack more of a punch. 
---
You should steer either north or south of the Forest. Savage Divide scales more with higher levels so you'll find some beefy mobs if another player was around. Toxic Valley and the Forest has caps on mob levels. Not sure about Ash Heap, but Ash Heap does have the occasional Scorched Beast. 
---
Craft, hunt and cook, and have some water purifiers at your camp. There's a perk in Perception, I think, that gives a chance to get extra meat. Just make sure to press the button when looking at their loot, it's not automatic. Pharma Pharma (In Luck) is great for all levels. Search medical containers and stock up on Disease Cures. If you're on PC, lemme know, I have a ton of stimpaks, purified water, and disease cures. Can craft and/or mod a couple of decent weapons and armor for ya. 
---
Don't forget to sleep in a bed to get the xp bonus increase, Feed the People event also rewards Canned Stew which gives xp bonus too. There's a farm with cranberries up in the northwest corner of map, they can be turned in juice that give an xp bonus. 
---
Aye, i didn't understand the post at first, but makes for an unfair game this element. Someone can make themselves wanted on purpose to bait people, then just have 3 mates waiting nearby with OP armour! Pvp is not as black and white as it should be. There are a lot of other attributes that can lead to a nasty experience, such as mine. 
---
Isn‚Äôt that going to give you a random mutation though 
---
You know how TSE work?
---
Ok it's clear that you're going to remain triggered all day. I'm going to be the more mature person and stop replying. You can even feel free to get the last word in as I'm sure it will make you feel better, though know that I won't be back to read it as I now have notifications for this thread turned off.  
---
I hope you don't stay stressed out over posts on reddit. Can't be good for your blood pressure or sanity.  
---
I appreciate it. If y'all manage to get your little 4 man neighborhood together, I'd love to see it. If anymore friends build there y'all are gonna need a home owners association. 
---
No all the BOS paints are for the t-60 power armour and look pretty much the same as the knight paint from fallout 4 you get them from handing in tech data after you complete belly of the beast
---
Additionally, they could have an in game razing and rebuilding of a location, wherein players build their camp, but it is randomly placed in an open plot if the last on you qere in is unavailable. All the plots would have to be made as uniform as possible, which would be boring, but I can certainly see a bunch of in game vault dwellers thinking "The Suburbs!" and cul de sacs were the greatest things since fried cram.
---
I work in a machine shop irl and I would LOVE this.
---
I guess. People see that I‚Äôm a level 264 and want to try and bait me.
---
Check your effects 
---
you‚Äôre the one typing up paragraphs. by all means keep it coming 
---
They probably love decorators on Instagram and twitter etc but on there servers...hell they prob hate them almost as much as dupers :/
---
For some reason they thought tacking multiplayer onto a really really old single player engine would "just work", would love to display collections of stuff as well just can't see it happening unless we get private servers and they lower the capacity of the servers from 24 - 36 to 4-5.
---
We do a lot of silly shit that robots ask us to do in the game already.  Like why does a robot need to collect honey?  Why should I go collect toys for a robot that thinks I'm a child named Leslie?  Why do I sit around and listen to fairy tales from a nannybot?  
---
It's profit generation through outrage culture.
---
Here's how it works:
---
1) Find something on reddit that people are mad about. Doesn't matter if it's even real or not.
---
2) Read their complaints on reddit, the more upvotes the better.
---
3) Make a video or write an article summarizing these complaints, but from a point of view as if you were experiencing them yourself.
---
4) Source the reddit comments as if it were proof, hoping that no one will follow up on your sources. Basically, your proof is the blue link.
---
5) Share this video/article back to reddit, who will then spread it like wildfire as confirmation of their opinion and validation of their issue.
---
It's basically a cycle of self validation. The complainers become the source for the article, the article detailing their complaints becomes a real, published, and even sourced article proving their complaints are real.
---
The end result is that the writer or video producer had to as little work as possible to make the article, as reddit already wrote it all for them, and then reddit also spreads it around for them, generating tons of ad revenue either on youtube or ads in the web page.
---
Step 6) You can repeat this process over and over on the same thing, so long as *someone* has a complaint about the game. The more cycles you go through, the more effective it is, and more likely people are to believe it without verifying it.
---
That's exactly what's happened here.
---
It started the first day of the PC Beta. The Beta deleted itself, and Youtuber's/Streamers who had been looking forward to and advertising the stream were left with nothing.
---
They were, correctly, pissed. So they sat there and slammed the game to 10,000+ viewers based off a beta glitch. Then, they scrambled the next day on the extended 8 hour BETA session to get footage.
---
That footage, was, as the developers even warned, full of glitches. Already mad about the events two days prior, they then slammed the game with negative reviews based on the glitches in the known-to-be-glitchy BETA sessions.
---
Websites like IGN and Kotaku, among others, then paraphrased those youtuber's/streamers reviews and started the cycle. These articles became quickly shared around on /r/fo76, /r/gaming, /r/fallout fueling the fire.
---
Then people on reddit complain. Then more articles come out detailing that people are complaining.
---
After that is when a lot of false claims started being made. Why? Because with all of these people focusing on the BETA issues, even before full release of the game, it was easy to get people to believe that your IP address was exposed, or that the game was unencrypted, or that it was easily hackable with no way to prevent it.
---
Most people aren't educated in IP/Networking to verify these claims. People who were educated with that quickly debunked it - but not before the post had 10k+ upvotes, which followed the cycle I said above, perpetuating the issue.
---
A lot of the articles were shared everywhere *but* this subreddit, as the people profiting from this cycle didn't want fans dismantling their claims with fact based evidence.
---
Then after that, it was the "I can steal anything from your inventory" claim. The cycle continued.
---
Then, oddly, after that in a lull of reporting, someone shared a massively upvoted post showing someone standing on a rock outcrop that had meshes past it's model, and then comparing it to other games.
---
Predictably, articles then came out detailing those complaints from a first person perspective.
---
After that, it gets wilder, with people complaining about a bottle of rum that, as far as rum goes, was barely above the average price for a quality rum but came inside a custom container.
---
After that, we had youtubers complaining they were being "attacked" on reddit and brigaded by redditors, with their evidence basically being that people who like the game... like the game... and won't hate on it with them.
---
Now, we're onto the next one, with the youtuber's claiming it will go F2P. The last article I saw about it linked to a bunch of Reddit comments (surprise) and conveniently overlooked common practices between physical retailers and distributors to try to claim a massive recall of physical copies was happening that insisted F2P was coming.
---
So that leaves us at today. This is why people keep obsessively hating all over this game - they're constantly fed self-confirming information. They're constantly told they're right, by people making profit off of repackaging what they've already written, and giving it back to them in a confirmation loop.
---
And these youtuber's and lazy article writers profit off of the laziest and most irresponsible "reporting" possible.
---
The solution? Stop supporting IGN, Kotaku, Jimquisition, and anyone who does "outrage style reporting," and support youtuber's who actually review things in a comprehensible, fact and evidence based manner.
---
Last night, someone nuked Whitespring on the server we were on so our team decided why not... we hadn't run Whitespring in awhile being that we are all above level 150... and Grahm comes wandering through the nuke zone, taking NO damage at all, with Chally MOO MOO taking no damage either... it was radical.   
---
Seriously, NERF Grahm! 
---
I‚Äôve had a guy a few days waiting for me to do the kills after I crippled most of the enemies I told his ass you want the Xp you finished them ...
---
He did lol , don‚Äôt stay behind high level player doing nothing I piss them off as much as anybody lol 
---
I‚Äôm equally excited for some of you PvE newbs to not shit your pants anytime the enemies you are shooting at actually have reasonable intelligence. Good riddance. 
---
That's cool. I'll just be pumped to have a neato brahmin. 
---
at level 45 i still feel like a scrub character even with max efficency on stats.
---
Consequences will never be the same.
---
I found an 2\* Instigating Explosive Gauss Rifle and it is by far my favorite weapon. I have been slowly upgrading it as I find and learn plans: I bought the NV scope for it, eventually learned the stabilized stock and long barrel, and just last week I got a UC prime receiver off the SBQ... I just love charging it up, letting it fly, and watching the ensuing destruction.
---
I usually don't have Demolition Expert on because it makes it somewhat un-fun and un-challenging. Instead opting for level 5 gunsmith so I don't have to fix it quite so often. But for a big fight I'll put on demolition expert. 
---
To true.  I'm feeling all V for Vendetta. 
---
I‚Äôve never heard or seen anything like that.
---
A room in a game that is only accessible by third party hacks being accessed is in no way the fault of the developer. People are actively hacking the game.
---
Defending them using a teleport hack would be no different than defending someone using an aimbot.
---
I am level 34. I breezed through the twenties. I run a sneak-sniper build. I thought out my play style and have stuck to perking out damage and sneak bonuses. I can two shot level 65s and one shot anything near my level or less. 
---
Plus the other mobs cannot really detect me. Some of the AI pathing makes them run in the general direction of gun fire but they don‚Äôt usually detect me. Since the patch I can be right on top of some of them and kill them without alerting any other nearby mobs.
---
Whitesprings has been the only weird location. The mobs run from me as soon as I manually aim. Not just one mob but every mob. It makes it very hard to snipe when fast as hell ghouls run away as you are aiming. It must be some kind of previous exploit fix?
---
I rarely die. I think I have died four times in the last two weeks. Three came from falling off a cliff. One came from falling off a cliff into three Yugais and not having a secondary short range weapon ready.
---
This game is very good about allowing snipers to get high ground if they want. I don‚Äôt even repair armor because it really is not needed. 
---
I use a non-legendary 308. With my perks it still hits hard enough to make the game seem like it is on easy mode. 
---
Yesterday I dropped about 30 fusion cores because I don‚Äôt plain on using power armor if I can avoid it. 
---
If you play a sneak sniper perk up being able to damage limbs in VATS. Crippling a leg makes things like Death Claws pretty easy. 
---
I like this idea, i think it would also be neat to see a legendary mod reroll, where you would sacrifice legendaries to reroll the legendary mod on another legendary.
---
Any mutations? I had adrenaline reaction and was confused when my damage was going up and down all the time.
---
If Bethesda didn‚Äôt fuck up so much then people wouldn‚Äôt be assuming the worst of them
---
One day I will be strong enough to do this.   Sounds fun.  I‚Äôm only level 26 
---
Strategic repositioning 
---
Not necessary...
---
* Cloth + Acid = Gunpowder
---
* Lucky Hole Mine + Excavator PA = Lead
---
* Vendors + Workshops + Scrapping Weapons = Steel
---
* [Super Duper](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Duper) \+  [Ammosmith](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ammosmith) = Extra Ammo
---
With player vending machines coming out, you'll have the option to buy ammo from players if you refuse to work for it. Ammo being traded among players gives players the opportunity to farm and make ammo to sell in order to make caps. This also gives low level players an opportunity to make extra caps aside from feeling restricted from trading to vendors from high level zones. I don't know if Hard Bargain can be used for player vending machines, which I doubt, but perhaps you can bargain with the player itself, I know player interaction is scary for most of you, but you have that option that doesn't require a perk card. If you're purchasing ammo from any vendors, you're wasting your caps when you could just use it to fast travel.
---
As a power armor user, nothing is more frustrating than when I nuke Whitesprings for some leggo farming, and come out of it with 4 pieces of armor. I have 3 decent leggos, one of which was a quest (ALL RISE!) and 2 I bought off the Trade Emporium. Player economy is cool and all, but I'd also like to actually earn cool shit
---
I really can't understand how someone can sit back, take a look at the current legendary system and basically say "this is fine, fair and works."
---
This system is a joke. I wasn't really a fan in Fallout 4 to begin with, but it was tolerable because: 
---
1. We had unlimited space to hold onto items. 
---
2. The perk system was set up so that we could eventually be effective with all types of weapons, so switching up your play style was just a matter of changing your weapons/armor out. 
---
3. Only 1\* items existed so your odds of finding a (relatively) solid combo of weapon and effect were much better. 
---
Now we are stuck with this unrewarding system for a game that makes you focus on certain weapons and perks only to make it extremely difficult to find weapons and armor to fit that play style that you allocated your special points to make. I am well aware of respec but that seems like a copout to fix the real issue. I shouldn't have to be basically pushed into remaking my character into melee or something just because it is better and I am having no luck getting a good legendary rifle. I should be able to put some hard work into getting that good rifle! 
---
To be clear: I am 100% okay with having to make choices such as specializing in weapons and perks, but the way this game is, you may never find that good legendary sniper you want and now your full spec into PER seems useless when Melee is much more viable without having to farm legendaries in hopes of a good item. 
---
Grinding for loot is fine, but have an end goal that is worth the grind. 
---
I like to think of him as Big Perm from the Friday movies.
---
I‚Äôm sorry 
---
I guess, Although I don't think the two go hand in hand. Again I would site fortnite, the most financially successful game right now, is f2p and not pay to win.
---
Thank you for checking on it.  Anything you can give us would be great!
---
same on ps4, picked 10 carrot and 10 tato flowers and only shows 1/10 of ‚Äúclimbing plant‚Äù (?¬ø Spanish name version). The others weekly challenges works OK. 
---
I just want my desert ranger veteran armor... is that too much to ask?
---
make sure u don‚Äôt have any hidden addictions, sometimes it won‚Äôt even show. i had an alcohol problem and didn‚Äôt know till i popped an addictol
---
Plants can only go in the ground.  They dont even have those raised planter boxes you find all over the farms.  
---
What you can do is build 4 foundations  around a tile, so you make a little dirt hole in the middle of your house.    
---
Basement garden.
---
That may not even be an objective in the PvP mode. It‚Äôs not going to be ‚Äúdo all the same quests without dying to players‚Äù 
---
Thought it was Wednesday's myself, last week they let us know it was being pushed to Thursday so again assumed Wednesday was there day :)
---
Hoping for some real info as well, i.e what we can expect moving forward and maybe some sort of idea as to whats going to be in the upcoming patch towards the end of the month.
---
Bethesda really didn‚Äôt think this shit through. PVP serves absolutely no purpose except to annoy people
---
That‚Äôs a legendary armour effect, not a perk and if you‚Äôre talking about power armour it‚Äôs useless when you have jetpack or Tesla coils, the life saver armour effect is pretty good for clutch situations 
---
If your point is "I have no clue how long term support games work", then you can keep your up votes. Since you clearly don't, you will get down votes and deserve them. Basing your opinions of a game designed to be added to for many years on a couple of hours during the the beta is pretty much the definition of ignorance. It's like someone telling people what ESO is like now when they haven't played it since the day it launched - your opinion grows more inaccurate every day that passes.
---
As has been pointed out repeatedly, the game is already far better than at launch, with most of the most glaring problems fixed by patches or simple mods. It's already not the same game as you played in many meaningful ways, and they haven't even started adding content yet. 
---
Does it still need work? Sure. But they have proven at this point that they have the ability to fix things, will work fast to do so, and are listening to players. That's what matters this early on in a LTS game, the promise that the game will keep improving. 
---
True I might not help as much in future, unless it's true new players.
---
I wish. These posts are always massive echo chambers. If you say anything against the norm of the post you just get down voted.  The people who don't want pvp really don't want it and aren't willing to make a compromise. It makes more sense for balancing , than fundamentally changing the context of the game and removing pvp entirely. 
---
There are greenhouses Flatwoods, etc
---
Just wondering if anyone has seen them
---
I'm a propane tank head!
---
No problem :)
---
Ah damn I forgot which exact quest but you get it as a reward from a questline in the mire. You get the radshield recipe upon completion 
---
I have all the wall sets and they don‚Äôt exist. The warehouse set (which is what they were under in FO4) do not have the completely windowed wall sections, only the half windowed ones.
---
1/ make ultracite and prototype paintjob craftable without having to craft a whole armor.
---
2/ excavator and raider PA paintjobs.
---
Is barbed walking cane allowed too, or will i get ban?
---
\*sneaks out and nibbles your bits\*
---
You do know the reason NV didn't get the bonus for metacritic score is because of its the problems the game I hated it when it came out and that's why I consider fallout 3 to be my fav. And end game ? 1 it was made in 18 months compared to 3 years and had like what 4 different endings. The end for 76 is kill a raid boss. Fallout nv had tons more content and options with bugs fallout 76 has hardly any content with bugs.

These were rarely taken before the 12/04/2018 update due to server  instability and the cost vs. reward. The should net scrap, not ore, and  the previous values (except maybe Fusion Cores) should be returned to  Pre-Patch levels.
---
Damage:
---
Energy Weapons:
---
Damage values for ALL energy weapons are sub-par. Ballistic weapons are Exclusively used in game which is a shame considering Energy weapons were supposed to be "end game" and overall superior.
---
-Gatling Laser:
---
Weight Exceptionally high for a mainly plastic weapon, Low Durability (breaks fast and is expensive to maintain) and damage is low especially tied to a Fusion Core, which is 3LBS per. Really only used in game if it also has Explosive + Two Shot. If Weight was half or less of current design it could make the lower damage an effective trade off considering the weight of the Fusion cores.
---
-Gatling Plasma:
---
Only used if an exceptional 3*** is found, vs Queen or Scorched, Low durability and High weight make it non-viable as a conventional weapon.
---
-Laser Pistol / Rifle.
---
High weight for a mainly plastic weapon, never used beyond lower levels due to poor damage and performance. Recoil on Automatic versions is unrealstic and makes it non-viable as well.
---
-Plasma Weapons:
---
Plasma Goo Bug (Many corpses are rendered unlootable with endless "Loading" icon) plus low damage and high cost of ammunition make it non-viable. Even Two Shot Explosives are not used in favor of Ballistic weapons.
---
-Tesla Variations:
---
Mainly (only ever seen used) to ensure "hits" in group / raid settings. Weight of weapon is ridiculously high for something made primarily of plastic, and damage is terrible.  FO4 it was an excellent Idea, but only ever used in game if a mod adjusted damage.
---
Missile Launcher:
---
Does not do enough damage to justify the weight of the launcher and missiles.
---
Durability:
---
Heavy Weapon:
---
All heavy weapons suffer terrible durability with the Missile launcher being the best example, Roughly 12‚Äôish shots breaks a missile launcher, making it a non-viable weapon due to the weight of the weapon and missiles. I‚Äôd  suggest seriously upping the durability or changing the per shot damage  to the launcher.
---
With the rebalancing on 12/04/2018 Power Armor on high level NPC's is  taking massive damage from higher level enemies. Fully repaired level  45 Power Armor broke twice with in 2 hours, with Power Patcher perk  enabled.
---
Seems to be rebalanced as of last Decembers patch.
---
Sounds:
---
Holotapes:
---
Seems to be on the same volume slider as the FX(Gunshots, etc.), it  should be linked to NPC voice slider, or their own slider. Disclaimed,  some appear to be linked to the NPC voice slider, but not others,  possibly core quest.
---
Power Armor Workbench:
---
When repairing or scrapping while in the workbench all sounds are  elevated, and stay as such until changing servers or closing to desktop.
---
Teams/Groups:
---
Instability:
---
More frequent ‚ÄúServer Not responding‚Äù seems to occur with teams,  especially when grouped with friends from different hemispheres.
---
Size:
---
It‚Äôs impossible to get more than 4 people on the same Server Instance  without significant instability, when trying to join 2 teams to the  same server (in our experience one group of 4 and one of 2) both teams  instantly become unstable, with at least 50% having to do a hard close  of client to break a logon / crash loop.
---
Creating larger teams (6 or 8) or ‚Äúlinked‚Äù teams would resolve this.  To resolve the possible PVP issue, forcing the teams into Pacifist mode  would keep teams from exploiting group dynamics.
---

For PC Users here are some Links for Performance Improvement Suggestions:
---
-FPS gains after some simple tweaks reported by Lam35  
---
Tested and Gained Mouse smoothness and a couple FPS post 2019 patch.  
---
-Increased Stability and FPS After CPU Affinity Assignment by monokoi  
---
Tested and Post Jan 2019 Patch reduced CTD's from (4+) times an hour to roughly (2) times an hour.  
---
-Fallout 76 PC Tweaks Guide done by Segmentnext.com  
---
Not personally used, by had a friend gain 15 FPS by following the Guide.
---
Because those same game developers obviously have no idea how to do it. That's why.
---
That would be hilarious. This sub would get filled with posts from players who just "take their time" complaining about how they should be allowed to loot the queen even if all they did was buff her health and plink at the scorched that spawn in.
---
Should have went with Barbie Girl. You can leave the server all you want, but it'll be stuck in your head for days 
---
Dont repair it in public garages, there‚Äôs a glitch where you can steal it when someone is repairing or modifying it only use it in a station in YOUR camp or a friends
---
Yep, exactly.
---
I wonder what their deal is. 
---
Only binoculars for melee weapon.
---
Make damage so bad gun types are near useless without 6+ levels of perks.
---
Make carry weight so low, you need multiple perks just to build a base.
---
Make hunger and thirst so immersion shattering rapid that it requires perks not to be obnoxious. 
---
First: this isnt a perk tree. It's a progression tree.
---
Second: it's not fun. It offers no depth. Just a series of mandatory selections. Using rifles? You NEED 6+ Perception perks. That's not interesting or engaging; it's just a mandatory progression tree.
---
When it comes to pvp balance I don't think bethesda "intended" anything at all. They just copy pasted everything from fo4 and called it a day.
---
I agree 100% with you with the end game. There is nothing to do after killing a queen. You could farm...but why? Farm for what and for why? Faster kill times?
---
Abbie, Rose, Taggerdy, the Overseer. The various raider group leaders. MODUS. The poor journalist bastard from Charleston. Many of the amusing Vendor Protectrons. 
---
Does John Henry Eden not count as a character? Are there no characters in Old World Blues?
---
Or does it not count because you don‚Äôt have a voiced dialogue or written lines for your own PC?
---
There are many characters and some amazing voice acting in FO76 and I‚Äôm sorry for you if you missed it but jealous that you still can look forward to it if that‚Äôs the case. 
---
This happened to me last night only with the shotgun. It was not damaging even level 5 spawn. Switching to my rifle I was one shotting them.
---
On xbox, go into the photo gallery and then hit the guide button and hit Y to take a screen shot, then delete the photo.  
---
Nope there are only the stations you get from the miner miracles quest or buy it from the enclave
---
Past fallout games could be either/or.  The survival piece was more optional.  In this one they kind of went half way each direction and it gets a little lost.
---
If you're wearing excavator PA you'll get bonus ore when collecting from nodes.
---
The story behind it, if I'm not mistaken, is that the suit was developed specifically for mining.  I think this PA might have worse defense than the rest but I've never actually compared them.
---
I used to think like this but now it's kind of like whatever. People spend money on aaalll kinds of really stupid shit (in my opinion). Gaming is a perfectly valid hobby just like any other hobby. 
---
That being said, I do think it's incredibly stupid to pay real money to cheat. I mean, what the hell? You're taking away the point of the game. At that point, why are you even playing? lol.  
---
Is there a list of all the level locked vendor items somewhere?
---
Craft them into Ultracite Fusion Cores.
---
I think you're being overly optimistic on how this will be implemented. I'm just picturing another semi-useful settings switch.
---
Radio Rats are awful. Far too much HP.
---
I get that...  Priorities, right!!!  Still, it would be nice to know this wasn't just forgotten.
---
Yep, gamma guns are the true pvp weapon.
---
That‚Äôs the thing though. Again maybe it‚Äôs buggy but last night I was playing with someone and we both had the quest up.  We needed to steal from a super mutant camp but only I got credit for doing so. Then we needed to collect blood samples from wolves, ghouls, and rad roaches.  My friend collected samples first then when I went to collect them it wouldn‚Äôt let me. But the task would disappear off my screen like it was completed. But when we went to drop it off he got credit and I couldn‚Äôt complete mission until I re did it.   However, when we had to make friends with death claw we both got credit.  I don‚Äôt know I appreciate the help though!

The player I encountered was intentionally racking up huge bounties to lure other players in to lose their caps when they can't kill him. I totally fell for it but I had sent him a message saying "haha very funny good show" and just kept messaging me about how he wasn't exploiting and trying to get me to shoot him again. He let his friend kill him a couple times as proof and eventually his friends orbital striked my base and I just signed off. 
---
Honestly, I'm kinda rooting for the lvl 39 in this one. Sounds like he/she is having more fun.
---
Not if it has pieces on it above your level. You have to wait until the timer runs out or you move too far away from it. 
---
So I take you think bullet sponges = challenge, then? I disagree.
---
No way I have the race car bed. My parents told me I'm gonna get a radio so I can talk to other race car beds
---
Then he also spends his time browsing the reddit of the game he doesnt like lol
---
if you really want to get to the top, you can walk around to the top of the cliff and there are some trees that fell onto the monorail that you can walk across and then run down the monorail til you get to the elevator location.
---
Can u recall here u got the metal chest dense mod?
---
They‚Äôve already touched on faction based PvP previously. Considering they are putting out a separate PvP game mode it‚Äôs clearly going to be tied in. 
---
Think I'd had such a good day I just wasn't expecting it.  You meet some great folks  but not this one.

Zealots legendary weapons.

---
Beth I hear you calling, but I can't come home right now, me and the boys are out raiding and I just cant find the sound 
---
Hey mate just start the game directly from the exe not the launcher, you just have to log in manually 
---
Right?!
---
If you have both arms you get more ore from mining nodes. It‚Äôs an inherent trait like getting +100 carry weight from wearing all the pieces.

It's all good. He was a good father while he was alive. I hope yours was too.

"YouTuber" and "Influencer" should be pejoratives.

Useless people with useless opinions grifting for pennies.

I am trying the rifle with Quick Hands. I have it at highest level (18% chance) and it doesn't seem to work... :(
---
We could be waiting a very long time though then :(
---
Last week's was empty and the one before that was as well, they can't keep pushing empty vague statements though. At some point they are going to loose all the good will the community has left for them.
---
They should be letting us know about duping going forward, stash size increase's (or not increased), Plans and recipes being level locked, Lag in Blast zones which seems to be worse since the last patch. talking about the loot tables from the SQB and maybe ways to make other areas worth nuking. I mean just looking at the hot on this sub shows that's what people are interested in, on this sub at least. 
---
I know the lever action animation fix was good n all but it doesn't really do much for us or give me hope personally that in 3 months since launch that's the only thing they've managed to get working.
---
Oh and can't forget new content! PVP map that no one asked for is nice n all but it's not really what people want is it?
---
I have a pipe revolver rifle which stacks perks from gunslinger AND rifleman. I have all gunslinger maxed and expert and master rifleman maxed.
---
I'm playing a sniper build so automatics aren't really my thing.
---
This sounds like a great way to completely eliminate the economy of the game. Traders have been awesome so far, and this post basically says to me that "I want to have all of the cool end game stuff without putting in tons of hours doing it." Let me ask, do you really think that you would want to come back to the game if everything you ever wanted was right there for crafting? There would be no reason for traders. There would be no reason to grind out nuke zones and legendary farm. And most importantly there would be absolutely no reason to go after end game content. This idea, at least for me, completely ruins the game. There is nothing quite like the rare drop rush when you find something that you've been looking for forever. Sorry. I didn't want to just say "no this is dumb." Tried my best to lay out why I personally think that this would ruin the game.
---
I agree with this; also a level 25-35 player's entry into the savage divide probably shouldn't be up the main highway through the Whitesprings resort, it should be up the ski slope to the Top of the World resort. Once at TotW, there's a million quest chains that should get you all the way to 50 without that feeling of being under powered. Went from 35ish to 50 in comfort with a rifle/shotgun build.
---
They don't want to make money I guess. That or they hired Bed, Bath, and Beyond to design their dlc. They even still have plenty of cool fo4 assets they could resell. It is baffling.
---
If you murder him the same way you did the English language with your grammar, then rest assured he'll get the message.  
---
Very true.  Forgot to use Wasteland logic when I questioned to whom would we deliver.
---
Robot has been programmed to commission these deliveries after being hacked (think pranked pizza delivery ordering) and thus continues to ask people to deliver drinks to x location.
---
Perhaps a series of quests where first we gather different ingredients and later receive plans to make our own.
---
No, it cures diseases.
---
Ah, fair point.
---
It's still not the developers original vision. You don't pain in something of your choosing on the Mona Lisa and then say it's better. It's not how it was intended
---
Oops haha
---
This is for the best. You did good. 
---
this is a good idea. cause the launcher wants you to either reinstall, check for shit, or sometimes won‚Äôt even open the game. like wth, reinstall? it‚Äôs right there 
---
Yeah, that's the only way a player can trigger your mines if they are hostile. Which is, *sinister laugh*, quite convenient when you have a workshop and you place two of them around the bench then another player tries to claim but goes boom. 
---
Vendor hopping at Watoga.
---
So run away from red smoking containers unless you requested it!  I thought only the keycard cargobot ones were locked.
---
Man had the same problem the day I bought downloaded and installed the game, only launch the launcher to update üòÇ
---
I leave my lead extractor unlocked also. 
---
Leave me a beer and we call it even.
---
They got off to such a great start in December, so I was a lot more hopeful then.
---
I still remember the first time Cannibal perk Execution worked for me. I was rushing to revive a friend (we were in two different teams working together) and in my rush I hit the wrong button. I didn't even know you could execute with cannibal yet. I was mortified. Kept yelling "I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" through mouthfuls of gore and meat. One of the most entertaining things that's happened in the game so far lol!
---
So i hope bashing will also end in banning. R1 is kdy for granades, noone should glitch it to use fucking bash!
---
How do you mean?
---
Add another "too cool of an idea for this game" to the list. 
---
Maybe but im mostly talking about content and the game itself. Sure the technical side can be fixed, the lack of content on the other hand is a different topic. 
---
YEAH i‚Äôm like what do you have to do? nothing has changed. you‚Äôre a launcher not the game just open what i need 
---
Yeah haha
---
Yeah, that will be fun if happen. Hope mines not disappear after I teleport another area.
---
Only Beth i know is as broken as a Beth game as well :(
---
Care more about Fallout than her though...does that make me a bad person?
---
I have a friend who refuses to play 76 because of reviews. But me? His friend who has played games with him for years and has a more direct understanding of what HE specifically will find fun? My review unfortunately hasn't swayed him. :(
---
He plays ATLAS all day instead.
---
good daddy
---
GTA5 has glorious PvP, it's both wonderful and terrible - just as PvP should be.
---
Now unequip the helmet and notice how nothing changes. You still have a visor, the HUD, and raindrops, but no helmet.
---
Yes this is an issue, I'd really like fixed. It's happened to me a few times trying to quickly pass stuff to my partner . I now just trade ( so slow ) or drop 1 ammo first and make sure bag appears . ( although I've had the bag still dissappear). I really hope this gets fixed,  as a simple QoL improvement 
---
bang on right here.  and no, we want real PVE maps, not extreme pvp for those bored of griefing pve players, lolz
---
Really? You‚Äôve seen greenhouse plans in Flatwoods?
---
I did this it's pretty cool. I have a full on pot farm (carrots) in my basement with grow lights üòÇ
---
See, there's the problem as I see it. A typical lvl 50 Scorchbeast shouldn't need a legendary weapon to kill it.
---
I doubt that it the main driver.  It's probably just a design issue.  They need to overhaul the system to update it too much, and they're hesitant to just do linear updates.  Though the duping is an issue that I'm sure plays into the conversation.
---
Dogs are in the kim chee.
---
Is there a German word for Shwag? If not, then I think it was just an alternate name they picked due to translation limitations, because that's the name of the achievement in the US.

boy aren't you going to feel foolish when poison becomes the new META
---
Even if you want to appky a mod you bough, you need the perk required to craft the mod itself
---
*purified water added*
---
*murders you with rage*
---
I too wish it wasn't that way. I think removing pvp would be way out there because I mean it's fallout online etc, I just think that the state it currently is in is not optimal. 
---
But I totally hear you about echo chambers on reddit and even this sub. Like some days people will post really constructive criticism and it's a downvoted post while some trashy clearly karma whoring post gets upvoted and gilded out the ass. 
---
Ah right, true true!
---
My lever action rifle is around that damage, although the firing speed is quicker, so it is fairly easy to dump five shots into the scorchbeast fairly quickly. Even then, it takes a couple minutes for me to bring down a scorchbeast without the help of one of the anti-aircraft rocket launchers. VATS does work on them, but because they zoom around and high quickly, they slip out of VATS quite a bit as a result. 
---
I don't know why you felt the need to come here and tell me about shit when you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Born_Survivor_(perk)

Feel your pain bro, I‚Äôm level 190 on my main character and no trophy either. It‚Äôs the last one I need to platinum the game. I started a brand new character yesterday and have been literally farming the golf course with high level friends I‚Äôm now level 48 at this moment in time so almost half way there in a short time. From what I‚Äôve read from others having this same issue most if not all of them earned level 100 in the monster mash event but didn‚Äôt get the trophy. I also earned level 100 in the monster event and I didn‚Äôt receive the trophy either. So it leads me to believe and other people I‚Äôve came across with the same issue at the event that it glitches/bugs the trophy out for some people. So this time with my new character I‚Äôve fully stayed clear of the event and the area in general. Once I reached level 99 touching 100 I will make sure the server is stable and I‚Äôm not in a high populated area like the golf course while I reach level 100 ‚Äúso I‚Äôll basically be farming my last 100 or so xp in a low enemy area to make sure my game doesn‚Äôt crash or start lagging etc. Weather or not this will make a difference I‚Äôm not sure and can‚Äôt confirm but I should reach level 100 by tomorrow at some point so I will report back here letting you know if I received my trophy this time. 
---
I'm approaching 10K 45 rounds. I have max bandolier and that shit is weightless and I  don't have a weapon that uses it.
---
Right now, because of weight perks, it makes more sense for me to carry items (bullets, chems, fusion cores) than to store them in my stash.
---
I agree completely with this. All ive seen it used for is griefing using exploits using bobbleheads etc. 
---
It is my understanding that area of the game world have a range of enemy levels.  Therefore if you go somewhere with a range of say 20-60 and there is a L 50 or L 100 person in the area or was just in the area, you end up with monsters at the far end of the range.
---
Silver lining... I have no tough decisions to make with my atoms. I'll just save them until Bethesda wakes up from hibernation. Really hoping that grounhog doesn't see his shadow!
---
It says I have no effects and I took addictol, antibiotics, disease cure, and radaway.  Unfortunately none of them worked.  I guess I‚Äôll try contacting Bethesda lol
---
I could use a vertical height increase by a couple feet so I can seal my roof.  I've got a three level high tree house, second level is half floors with four turrets.  Third level is my hangout, bottom level is just the foundation with a statue and my camp inside it.  I'm not sure I could move the camp up a level without messing up my farm and purifier+generators.  
---
So basically I've got a 3x3 slanted roof with the center piece missing because it's just barely above the maximum height from where my camp is placed.  I could probably do an entirely flat roof but that just doesn't look as good.  I suppose I could call it my gigantic sky light!
---
It‚Äôs also a legendary effect on armours, ‚Äúauto stim effect‚Äù, my mistake but I don‚Äôt use armour or agility perks so I haven‚Äôt come across that or ever used it.
---
Enforcer is so *ludicrously* powerful. I used it on my first build, just crazy good. 
---
Yeah, I think there's not enough meat in the main quest - even including the early side-quests you naturally encounter - to keep up with itself during levelling. I usually do a mission or two on the main quest, catch up on side stuff, and then focus on discovering new locations, improving my C.A.M.P., and participating in events for a few hours before getting back into it. Sometimes that few hours has to get split up over a few days due to other commitments.
---
&gt;A fallout game with online elements?
---
Yes, because there is nothing about the game that *requires* you to play with other people.  You can literally do the entirety of the game solo.  I did the entire main quest line, and launched a nuke, by myself.
---
&gt;Don't really understand why people are buying a game
---
What's to understand?  Fallout has a huge fanbase of people who love the franchise.  Fallout 3 is my favorite game *of all time* and I'm nearly 50.  That's a lot of games played.  So yeah, I'm playing this *despite* the pvp elements, as are a lot of other people.
---
This all could be solved with pvp and pve servers, like literally every other online RPG has.
---
I mostly have a rifle/shotgun build, but I ground them at with Shotgun and enforcer perk, then use a good 2h melee &amp; Incisor rank 2 to knock their health down. I can usually take 3 without a problem (so long as I have shotgun shells) &amp; in PA. The other day in a nuke zone they just kept spawning as I was harvesting flora. My shotgun ended up breaking from the 6 that spawned and the SBQ fight before. I was overencumbered and forced to fight them, but still managed. 
---
I had the same problem.  
---
Consider exploring the south east and south west sides of the map for a while, doing various side and events, then eventually go back to the main quest at top of the world.  Once you have leveled up a bit it will be easier.  Note also that enemies spawn leveled to nearby players, so if a higher level player has been through the area you may be in for a rough time.  Server hopping sometimes helps.
---
plot twist
---
OP thought they were a raider but turns out he was taking water everyone had left out for him!
---
Why purchase a game to also pay for the experience? I will never understand.
---
Passive mode is just god mode but for players only 
---
Crafting Legendaries will have to be a feature implemented in the future. You cannot have a game where crafting is a major mechanic, and not be able to craft legendary gear. It breaks the point of crafting as all players will eventually reach the point that all their gear is legendary, and loose the reason to craft.
---
I've got all the legendary gear I need for the moment, and now the only things I craft are furniture pieces for my camp.
---
It should be natural for a game like this to allow us to scrap legendary equipment to salvage the effects and apply it to other weapons or armor. Functions like these are usually balanced through the use of rare materials to either salvage or apply said mods, as well as the risk of breaking said item and getting nothing in return. The same principle applies with re-rolling legendary effects too.
---
you probably have some higher level players around or were there shortly before you. you can grind them out but it‚Äôs better with a higher level or else you‚Äôre eating through ammo and stims. 
---
i also have noticed enemies seem tougher the farther west you go. but mostly scale to your level. 
---
Yeah, but there is other games where you can do that stuff and ALSO have a game that works right or is fun. Including other fallout games!
---
I dropped a level 20 upgraded hunting rifle for my partner and it was gone . 100% not duped. I found the gun and used it until 25 when I found a better one. Bags not appearing doesn't automatically mean the items were duped.  It happens to anything dropped, including ammo.
---
Yeah, that's how it is supposed to be, because the game designers made shitty game design choices. What's your point?
---
i couldn't agree more with this, add building next to teammates as well and that would be perfect for camps.
---
Was that the one in which they promised more open and better communications with there valuable customers?
---
Yeah, it does. The other guy covered it well enough that I don't need to reiterate points. I think the story in 76 is one of the most interesting overall in the entire series. It's a bummer for you that you're not able to see it.
---
Lmao!
---
I encountered Grahm in flatwoods and i was like hold up as i pull out my gun. and see that he is freindly
---
"Bethesda really didn‚Äôt think this shit through" describes every element of this game
---
I was having lots of fun.   It's the quiting the server and stopping playing; how is that fun.  Sure root for the little guy I do as well.  But not the pathetic quitter.
---
And here I am on console just trying to get someone to help me kill the queen, instead of 8 blueberries that do no damage and hide in the shack.
---
Im so sad youre not on xbox :( 
---
Go to r/fo76bazaar or 
---
Level 60.  I have yet to run across this character.
---
That would finally be something worth spending atoms on
---
Sounds like the beginning of a feral ghoul transformation.......
---
Right now, I'd rather have more end game content, but that's just me. I love the game, but it's getting kinda stale. Need some group raids or dungeons or something.
---
Bullets aren't really effective under level 30ish to be honest, you need a melee weapon, honestly all of my ranged builds carry a sledgehammer built for their level with the bleed mod on them. 
---
Yeah only reason 8k m over 100 is cause of farming did pretty much everything within a few days of story and "sidequests" loved hearing a stupid bedtime story from a robot quality quest right there.
---
A the superior arsehole.  Didn't take you long, your smugness.
---
You make some fair points.  
---
Regarding the stash, stability is a factor.  The long term solution, if they intend to expand the stash, may require some retooling of the system.  I'd just like an update.  More space would be great.  As you say, there are other priorities, but that doesn't mean we should let this one get lost.
---
Regarding builds, I agree the game is not overly favorable towards build management, especially with respecs, but if you get your special right, you can tweak your build quite a bit inside of one framework using perks.  We only get five total characters to play, so to truly experiment, we have to get creative.
---
The PvP servers are what I'm looking forward to most. I love wrecking kids while I'm invisible. The power of the gank
---
Sorry, very low level player here who has never even been to whitesprings (always assumed level 15 would get wrecked)
---
Whats the taboo around doing this?
---
The Dragon isn't a legendary weapon on its own (I mean, unless you have a legendary version of course, lol)
---
Didn‚Äôt see these two:
---
*Combat* During non-melee combat, firing at the enemy will cause the screen to ‚Äúglitch out,‚Äù is how I‚Äôd describe it. Basically turning the pip boy on and off at a pace of like 5 times per second. Typically lasts 10-30 seconds. 
---
*Trading* When trading, dropping, picking up or stashing large quantities of items, the counter starts at the maximum quantity of said item (not the glitch). When you reduce quantity, counter starts off slow (not the glitch), gains speed (not the glitch), then kicks it into warp speed and endlessly counts from max to zero over and over until you stop (the fucking glitch). 
---
Can you tame the house cats that can be found wandering around random areas?
---
Even better - give wooden armor a purpose. +1 to stealth while in the forest, or buoyancy so you don't sink in water. Increase the electrical resistance, or make all insects friendly. Give it some strange perk that makes everyone regret scrapping it in the past
---
got it in an SBC drop...i want to find mods for it...really cool cuz you hear and see a little explosion.
---
Not sure why that is relevant. Back when this game released reviewers and critics were crucified for not enjoying the game. The hive mind opinion was if you didn‚Äôt enjoy the game for what it was then why did you buy/play it? Well guess what, PvP was part of that deal so if you don‚Äôt like PvP then take the advice of this sub and go play something else, perhaps next time you‚Äôll heck what a game is like before buying it.
---
I quit the server all the time. Dinner, sleep, some shits (other times Ill just nestle up in my CAMP).
---
Just wait until the next patch. We won't be able to kill anything or anyone. Assassins and Sentinel with fireproof is going to become more broken that it already is. Time to break out the Bloodied Grognak's Axe...
---
I will buy it of you. It have best stealth mod. If you have ap regen one i will buuuy it on PS4
---
Literally you're complaining about the workshop mechanic when you clearly state it's pvp yet use it as an example? that's pretty dumb. 
---
Tell me about it!
---
I love competitive PVP, but when i want to Fallout would be the last game i would think about loading up to get it on.
---
If the servers worked, the duping didn't exist and PVP builds were required i may...even then its a big may, consider Fallout but its doubtful.
---
Never played fallout for pvp, nor has anyone else (previous fallout games ofc) so no clue why resources are being pushed into PVP, was hoping a good quality into the vault might shed some light on that and what they were going to add for the PVE players as well
---
The two shot variant mustve been explosive, with a rifle build and an explosive lever im hitting 1k damage or so, also in luck add in bloody mess, that will be an extra 15% as well
---
That‚Äôs the essence that is Jeremy, fuck that guy and fuck all of those other douchebags. Jeremy ruined magic now he‚Äôs got to go and ruin something else. FUCK JEREMY.
---
Yep I thought it could be just that.  But taking the scrap is a clue to true intentions.  Also the hanging back was weird.  I should have been smarter.
---
Aww shit, she's a burnin' again!
---
So I think Bethesda glitched, my weapon levels dropped from what they actually are, guess I‚Äôll just have to wait for the glitch to be fixed
---
Ps4?
---
Well I don't think anyone would want to argue that pvp definitely needs balancing.  Passive mode should apply to your camp at the very least too, and likely make them resistant to explosive damage too. They should just be much much harder to destroy. So at the very least you have the satisfaction of knowing your aggressor has wasted a ton of ammo and time.  
---
Common sense goes a long ways too, my base has never been attacked but my base is tucked away. My much higher level friends base is constantly attacked but his camp is smack in the middle of one of the most populated areas . 
---
Is it possible to survive a nuclear blast wearing this? I saw a bunch of people who never left the blast zone when the nuke was coming. They were perfectly fine after it detonated.
---
PvE servers are impossible with workshops.  They‚Äôd have to be removed or otherwise completely retooled or one player can lockdown a whole server and afk walking in crouched circles in a basement somewhere.
---
Some cool ideas in here!
---
btw i love your reddit name
---
Hahaha, take a trip
---
&gt; \-RNG is Seeded: 
---
Kind of a misnomer; all pseudo-random number generators have an initial seed. Manipulating the seed to get better drop is very-very unlikely to work in practice. However, having a different (and temporary) loot table and/or loot chances for certain players is quite doable in general. Let's assume the game can check if you are recording it via external tools and notifies the server about it. Then the server switches to a more favorable loot table or better legendary enemy spawn chances so in your recording, the game feels more rewarding. Outlandish? How many youtubers show their TSE off or stumble upon 2-3 3\* legendaries where you rarely seen one 1\* ever? [Here is my small simulator for "non-seeded" legendary drops for comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aibfnr/rng_legendary_loot_drops_simulator_webpage/).
---
No idea.
---
I have a video clip of me hitting some one in monster mash like 4-5 times with a two shot lever action.  He was already low on health but the first short dropped him to what looks like no HP.  He didn't die, so I followed up with a few more shots.  After standing there for a few seconds not dying, he hit me twice with a Mr Handy buzzsaw to kill me.
---
Its already annoying enough that a normally very weak weapon is able to 2 hit someone in power armor, but its being frustrating that he did it after taking 3-4 hits without effect.
---
Exactly right, you put it better than I did.
---
This is why I stopped watching any fallout 76 content on YouTube ever since launch it‚Äôs just all been negative and bashing the game for no reason 
---
If you want to find Ghram more reliably, visit FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  Set the pages to display "new" items first.  Re-load the page from time to time.
---
Traders there like to find Ghram and hop him for plans to sell.  They'll post that they've caught him, and hold him there while other people get added to their friends list.  Then the group will server hop back to the server repeatedly to get different plans off of him.  Some people will be holding him still, and some people will be hopping back into the server.  They usually do it until he disappears onto another one of his routes.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
cool, what are the specs?
---
Have to agree.  The game is full of emotional content, either the wicked sense of humour at the tableaux of arranged items in set pieces, or the sad, heart-breaking stories of the people in the aftermath of the bombs.  
---
It's about a surprised attack and stun from a Yao Gui and me yelling "F\*\* you!" as I blast it to smithereens with my gatling.  It's not the ultra-competitive MMO some people wanted, but it's still, definitely Fallout, and it's still, definitely my "can't wait 'til I get home."  150 hours in and in no rush to stop.
---
The new PvP mode is basically PvE without the anti-griefing measures. Both will be receiving the same content. Having a PVP mode can help with further game balance.
---
That really makes sense, can't believe I didn't think of that. Okay I'll try doing a few server hops! Thanks! 
---
I can send you a few bucks on PayPal if you're struggling bro
---
I'll role play as one for a few caps a day.
---
Step 1 - Ignore youtubers.
---
Step 2 - Play the game.
---
Step 3 - ????
---
Step 4 - Profit :)
---
I have NEVER duped. I have a 3 star legendary Gauss and a 3 star legendary radium rifle. My sneak dmg is 3.5x at night and my criticals are doing +123% dmg. My Gauss is doing 526. I grinded the hell out of this game, and now the only thing I enjoy is PvP. I one shot kids all day and it's so damn satisfying. More importantly, I one shot any kid who thinks his duplicated explosive double shot can compete lol. Can't wait for PvP servers!
---
Would help if you linked your build or if that's not possible at least type it out 
---
Your just saying your friend takes a youtubers opinion over yours. Says alot about your friend and shouldn't effect you.
---
One Gun Army! for me.   Stun and Cripple limbs.
---
Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised but I haven‚Äôt heard of that.
---
Found him once, it was great.
---
Just a shame he had absolute garbage to sell.
---
**Combat:**  
---
is this triggered while in VATS?  
---
**Trading:**  
---
Controller or mouse/keyboard? If mouse do you have an unlocked scroll wheel?

I was expecting Jangles to blow up or something, nah bro... It's LSD time.

I will have to try mooch a couple points from somewhere to get the bloody mess perks
---
In the context of getting pvp addressed and fleshed out i think it would be neat to pick up the backpack and selectively place yourself as a marked target for others. Maybe only within some of the larger towns to keep it from being a map wide needle in a hay stack. 
---
:(
---
My only way to do consistent damage now is to run at least 2 Small Arms bobbles from Sugar Grove
---
Maybe don't buy online shooters if you are going to call getting shot bullying? Like no one wanted this game to be what it is, but you aren't a victim of bullying here.  
---
and they stopped posting the "official" roundup
---
It actualy have stealth mod that have 3effects. Much better that shadowed combat.
---
I wouldn't use perks on it.  So far the only thing I use bash for is to tag enemies when I'm traveling along with lower levels so they can get hits in.
---
We should be able to LOCK our items in our pip boy so they can't be scrapped, dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Then any legendary items we have UNLOCKED should be able to be SCRAPPED for a 5% chance to pull one legendary modifier off the weapon.
---
People can now farm and grind to their ideal build.  Bonus is it makes mass duped weapons LESS valuable.  Why go for a duped weapon everyone has, when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
That's a good point. Can a stash itself be overburdened? lol. It could randomly put overage from the stash into your inventory, but that would ruin the immersion.
---
Hey, here's an idea- STOP MAKING CARRY WEIGHT A FUCKING GAMEPLAY MECHANIC BECAUSE IT IS LITERALLY THE MOST ANNOYING ONE. I console'd it out in every prior Bethesda game and it just made those games a hell of a lot more fun. I do paperwork by day; I don't want to also do paperwork in a fucking game.
---
I have a standard level 45 dragon.
---
I usually fire at it with my (two shot) Gauss rifle in vats until I get a critical. Then I use the critical with my dragon. When it lands I use mele.
---
Of course legendaries help, but I got through level 45-70 just fine doing that.
---
Honestly, i would rsther the legendary system be scrapped and instead only get "legendary" weapons as quest rewards, they completely dwarf any standard weapon in the game and the whole game becomes about trying to get the best legendary of that current time, so, trying to get a TSE combat shotgun basically
---
That says something about the friend, but not you.
---
Atm nope. Its utterly useless outside the forest. Also why just about everyone suggests carrying a melee weapon..
---
I worry I don't have the right perks, then realise, I can still kill with what I have.  Let's go!
---
bingo bango bongo hongo in the congo
---
Thanks u/djwikawik.  You make some good points.  But I will say what I've sayed elsewhere.  Most people who have downvoted me do so for one of two reasons.  One, they think the game is too broken to worry about stash, which has merit.  Two, they think I play wrong.  You seam to be a healthy combo of each, but I will rebut the second point.  
---
I think it's great that you manage your stash so well, but why does that mean I have to play exactly like you.  The point of this conversation is to see all the sides in one place.  Ultimately Bethesda will dictate the guidelines in the game.  Either way, I would not say either one of us is "doing it wrong."
---
Change the buff so it is based on the total of all player levels instead of the number of players. That way the lower levels checking out the event because they do not know what is going on would only have a small effect on the damage sponge (and may actually be able to help)
---
Anybody notice they changed Grahm's VA after one of the updates?
---
It used to be the smoother Super Mutant voice, but now he has the really growly voice.
---
We have tons of dog meat just kill the dogs in the game 
---
new job is great. ive already gotten a promotion.
---
This post should be stickied.
---
Awesome dude, I'll have to look for ya 
---
Part of it is the absolutely appalling trade system.  There are no instructions, and I can't figure it out.  Plus, people usually don't HAVE anything I need.
---
Yeah player base is mixed, I noticed that a group of 3 is usually destructive especially if they‚Äôre teen kids on mic ,saying shoot him I need wood hahaha 
---
Had the same happen to me. Accidentally dropped all my .308 ammo :( 
---
They will definitely need to retool in the long run, especially for any large increases.  The linear increases are, as you say, band-aids at best.
---
Just tell me you didn't hurt Chally...
---
Oh I did. I stopped playing when I got red dead 2. I check in from time to time to see if any big changes are made. It's also fun to peek in and see how cult like it's getting here. Weird circle jerks and witch hunts to rout out non believers. It's not unlike the Star citizen sub. 
---
The incessant screeds y'all spam here to browbeat Bethesda into buffing your build aren't fun.
---
True but not in an event, was very calculated from the start.  Not like farming or plan hop.  Didn't have that feel about it.
---
Frogs.  That uranium adds up.  Just don't frag yourself.
---
Yes please.  Dupers stacking bobbleheads is annoying both in PVP and PVE.
---
I've had times I've gone to fight the queen, and she's DEAD within 2 mins of the nuke dropping.  Someone down there stacked like 100 duped bobbleheads and blew her away faster than most people could get suited up and get down there.
---
Oh my bad. I‚Äôm on Xbox so controller. 
---
VATS you know I‚Äôm not sure but I want to say either 
---
If I were a trader I'd have all weight reduction perks and armor. Honestly if you cant carry a good inventory within carry weight, then yeah the traveling trader motif might not be for you. Understandable 
---
So I showed this to my wife, and we had a good laugh.  You get a thumbs up for the most creative response I've seen so far.  Cheers!
---
The correct way is to spam Bethesda with buff requests? k
---
I think you want to get the Modern Bed or Vault-Tec Bed 2 - I'm not much a fan of the fancy bed.  Both those plans are available from Whitespring Resort so shouldn't be too hard to get and not too expensive either.
---
Simple Modern Bed is the one with the blue Vault-Tec sheets.  Vault-Tec Bed 2 is the one with the clean green blanket over white sheets (clean version of metal bed with sheets).
---
So much this! I miss Dgmeat! But that said, it would get a bit crowded if everyone had the same pet.
---
Ah you made me laugh, just what I needed, hence posting.
---
Maybe you were standing in a nuke zone, and the area still didn‚Äôt load in for you all the wonders it brings. I know this happened to me.
---
They take much more damage when landed. To land them easily do one of the following:
---
* Shotgun, use enforcer perk to make their wings crippled in 3-4 shots on average
---
* Heavy weapon perk for passive cripple chance
---
* Perk to Target wings specifically with vats (under perception)
---
I'm melee so I carry a shotgun and enforcer perk to cripple quickly when I'm hunting scorchbeast.  They must take like 200% damage landed, I'm not sure exactly but it's wayyyyyyyy more lol
---
I followedd him around the map once. Went in a huge weewad path up in the top left of the map and all the way down through Point Pleasant toward the Ash Heap.
---
At one point we ran into some mole miners and Grahm picked up a fucking misdile launcher off one and proceeded to blow everything up.
---
I thought AAA game developers/publishers were supposed to release a full, QA tested game for $60, now they release half assed, bug/glitch riddled, boring games with over priced extra monetization for $60. My how things have changed.
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate- I used to call the supply drops for the lower levels. 
---
Don't encourage them.
---
Also, I wouldn't imagine the same could be said for pepper... but, you should have seen my sister when we were growing up. Oi.
---
Well, it's outlandish how much sugar... damn.
---
&gt; I fought the queen with level 20-30's with me being the highest at 110. I knew we couldn't beat it so I just walked away, and so did everyone else.
---
So, just out of curiosity. When the rest of the players left did the Queen's health go back down to a 1-player level, or does it stay up even if people leave the area?
---
Three Dog, Three Dog, Three Dog!  :)
---
Seriously, I don't even care if I can meet him in the game.  Just put him on the radio.  Give me a reason to listen to it :)
---
I'd be in on this.
---
And here I thought art was all about interpretation...
---
In many cases, mods for Bethesda games are better than the game itself.
---
Doubt he was a duper, probably the guy who used xp exploit in the distant past.
---
Will you be quiet.  She might hear you!  LOL
---
Its how we learn though. I imitated my brother until I realized he was no role model.
---
People may not get much "smarter" with age, but they do get opportunities to grow. 
---
Can confirm, Good Doggie is one of the best perk cards to take away worrying about hunger.
---
I am trying Cannibalism on my new guy. It's more fun, but the problem is you have to get out of power armor to cannibalize. Which is kind of annoying.
---
A lot of reading. Thanks for compiling it! 
---
I'm getting a new bug when I try to trade something for 0 caps I can go past it to 25000 but can't go the other way. I didn't see it posted.
---
Gatling plasma. I don't care about how fragile it is, or how expensive the ammo is. It's just good clean fun. 
---
I think that‚Äôs cause they said they were gonna start including the ‚Äúpatch notes‚Äù in the weekly newsletter...although they were already sharing the main highlights, üôÑüôÑüôÑ so I appreciate players doing nice things like this 
---
That when a fusion core completely depletes it loads in the fusion core with the lowest charge instead of a highest charged fusion core
---
Cool!!!  Though we play differently, I think it's awesome the way different people approach the game different ways.
---
Lol.well I'll be back on Saturday If you want to spread the wealth! Thanks!
---
I care, that beeping means there's food nearby.
---
Quite the rapscallion, you are. 
---
Other than video games and movies, no, I don't hoard in real life...  :)
---
Pipe revolver, got me out of more scrapes than I can care to remember, practically never breaks, deals enough damage to kill most things with a couple of good hits   ( if you max out pistol and rifle perks with bloody mess)
---
I use other weapons but mostly fall back on this one when they break or run out of ammo
---
Ah that makes sense I never use vats I run a heavy gunner build. So the only use for vats is for spotting enemies I can‚Äôt see.
---
I‚Äôve been having this issue too. Seems like there are mobs spawning that are invisible. I‚Äôve been getting hit or insta die. But when I‚Äôm just getting hit I‚Äôve crouched, saw that it was danger and jumped up on a car and whatever it is that had spawns goes away after a minute or two. 
---
Definitely frustrating.
---
If it is a random encounter yes. 
---
the problem is people with no luck stats get shit durability items that break really fast..
---
He uses beta, yet is a chubby neckbeard who is losing his hair. Unlike us, total Chads.
---
&gt; How is it worse? Weapon perk cards are added up then applied, bloody mess is applied after that. 
---
Still conjecture with no reference. "Someone said it on Reddit once" isn't a valid reference.
---
&gt; As for damage resist, didn't see 76 on there, my recollection was basically bigger number suffer less. 
---
It's the same as 4. You can test it yourself with a friend using known damage and resistance values.
---
I drop any good "lower level" legendaries I find for new players.
---
Feels good that someone gets some use out of it :)
---
p.s.  I wish they would go back to scaling legendaries to YOUR level.  I'd still drop stuff I don't want for other players to grab, but I could at least get some useful stuff myself :(
---
Uhhh, who‚Äôs gonna tell him?
---
Kids stop learning through imitation before they hit 9 years old. If a teenager is still doing it, it's not to learn. 
---
I think you need a new rifle buds.  There arent enough % increases to get from perks if you're working with a horribly low base damage.
---
With +60% rifle cards alone, we can see that the pipe rifle must be horrid.   137 is the total damage.  60% of that is 82.2.   This means you're buffing 55 base damage, and that's without counting gunslinger buffs.
---
Thats shit damage bro.  
---
Not really related to your question, but a bit of piggy backing... If you wait to do the main/side quests until lvl 50+ you will get higher level rewards.  Most notably the Black Diamond (1h melee).
---
I haven't made a male character yet, but yes, absolutely more beards!! What if I wanna roleplay as Grizzly Adams, I mean, c'mon Bethesda.
---
It was most likely deleted because the server was under high load and stuff you drop gets put into a queue for deletion. 
---
I would rather random non emersion items in the atom shop. Any faction or item which makes sense to be in game should be able to be found by playing the game.
---
The game is generally extremely absurdly easy so yes, check your controls and stuff, you may be missing something if you are really struggling. Are you equipping weapons and armor? Is everything the right level? are you using vats? aiming for the heads? etc? are you doing something crazy with perks or not equipping them? 
---
"the golf place" is the exception, it's where end game players typically hang out so enemies do scale very high there.  
---
He was with me INSIDE the Charleston capitol building. While I was killing all the other mutants.
---
DO NOT buy in-game items for real $$ ever.  Even more so if you're giving them your personal info and payment methods.
---
You're literally feeding dupers who crash the servers when they do their dupes.
---
I saw your post and was going to link it, but I exceeded the 40,000 character cap for posting so had to cut a bunch of example links / pages.  
---
Yes / No...  
---
We (modders) think it's possible to have a true RNG, but going back as far as JAVA based games a "Seed" RNG has been used. There are a couple examples out there of games that have reportedly used "True" RNG's but in '76's Case seeing repeated Legendaries (Good or bad) really seem odd.   
---
I mean using your tool, out of 20'ish weapon drops what are the odds of half of them being 1\* Anti-Armor, or Two-Shot, because I've seen both happen, off 1\* - 3\* NPCs   
---
As for Manipulating it... 
---
Maybe... I know a few that will Nuke a White Springs, farm it for 20 minutes, analyze the drops as a group of 4, then server hop, and they have consistently "locked in" a particular table, getting a high rate of X. Best Example is this can be done with NPC's themselves, they get a "Clubhouse" with (3) 3\*'s, (2)2\*'s and (1) 1\*, they can force respawn that grouping (plus or minus a star or two each time) for 3 hours.  
---
As for YouTube Examples, I find Youtube a black hole, both in content and time, so personally avoid it, but is it a common occurrence or was that sarcasm?
---
Dense mod on armor "significantly reduced damage from explosions".  If your in PA, can't help ya.  :)

---
I found Jims review of the game to be quite accurate and he didn't dwell on it with twenty, ten minute long videos. I also trust his fact checking far more than the others.
---
Funny im tring to find a full set of unyielding wood armor. 
---
There's also an emote asking to PVP.
---
its no more of a completely broken mess than any other Bethesda game though. 
---
why are people surprised?
---
I don't know if they actually added it, but as of late (the past week) I have noticed when I burn through one core, the game is putting in a lower leveled one vs the 100/100's I have. Usually, I jump out whenever I see the switch and toss in a junk one. 
---
I‚Äôm away from console right now let me try remember 
---
Ask Santa.
---
A week ago, I would have said the system is fine, but I agree with this.  A high level mutant destroyed me and took a ton of my precious junk, including some flux.  I never engaged him, but even through the mitigation, he wrecked me.
---
My opinion may not be popular, but you did invite yourself for pvp by taking a workshop.
---
If I wanted it bad enough you better believe I would take every advantage I could come up with to do it fast an efficient.
---
I personally enjoy the challenges of player interaction, but also know when to cut my losses and get out with my junk bag intact.
---
I usually leave workshops alone, and if I do take one I assume the worst can an will happen if I stick around too long and someone wants to take it.
---
Yeah, fuck people who stack science bobbleheads to get infinite tries to hack terminals! 
---
lol thanks. I've seen this happen a lot on reddit - sometimes the complaints are justified, sometimes it's just made up nonsense.
---
The easy way to tell it's happening is to see if these writers come back and follow up, which they almost never do. (IGN did make a correction once I saw - they never said it was a correction though, they just replaced the original article with a new one.)
---
I would trade for a large portion of those...
---
I miss mr new vegas 
---
Wow that looks awesome. True fallout fan copying the poses. Love it. 
---
From what I've seen, the game was rushed so I'm expecting new content close to the middle if not end of the year. And I still feel like there's just a skeleton crew working on it looking at the amount of fixes and the pace they come out in.
---
Awesome, I came across a bomber jacket and was getting a few T-60 Mods too
---
&gt;woe is me.
---
Unfortunately the only way to tell if Bethesda intended for it is for everything in the game to be working as intended.
---
There's a few things broken at the moment that seem to allow for Immortal players but Bethesda wont acknowledge or confirm whats broken and what isn't or some sort of time line for each individual issue to be fixed.
---
If they get duping under control then they can re balance any weapons that need it, stop the stacking of bobblehead effects and the one or two perk cards that have weird side effects (not naming them as it seems pretty low key still atm).
---
Bethesda didn't mean for the wasteland to be full off The Kurgan type players (immortal) they can't have! But there silence and acceptance of these issues are having a detrimental effect on the customer base. 
---
I hope that they can see this because clearly customers should NOT have to post this sort of stuff, the game should be working well enough that it isn't necessary but at the moment it clearly is :(
---
If someone is abusing a bug in the game then it counts as cheating imo, Bethesda should be quicker at stopping it though other wise there silence is taken as acceptance and people don't feel bad about doing it as they know even Bethesda doesn't care.
---
That‚Äôs wild haha he‚Äôs great when he comes by to help you off load your stuff but he might be a lil glitchy 
---
I agree but they need to add something fresh to keep it interesting soon. I love the game but I feel like there was a lack of unique quests (non repeatable events) to keep it interesting for the time it's been out
---
Did you find a camp with 5 rocket turrets?
---
Melee and power armor
---
Level 10-40 is a very grindy time.  You're not powerful enough for some areas, yet you still want to explore.
---
My general rule is (and I've gotten 2 characters up to level 150+):  If you're getting rekt, drop back down to a lower level area to gain ammo and meds and junk.  Then go back up into the higher level areas.
---
Also if a HIGH level player gets to that zone before you, ALL of the enemies will be higher level.  Go to a different area, or server hop.  If YOU are the first one in that zone, the enemies will scale to YOUR level.
---
So... Don't do it then?
---
Ooooo i want to go there too now! Uh must be expensive to travel there from middle of europe
---
I would give my right kidney to actually find some players who use the mike. Even if it is just to ask me for stuff.
---
He, in particular, creates almost entirely whiney clickbait, as far as I can tell.
---
I'm going to start doing that. I'm just farming nuke zones for stuff to sell so I can buy all the camp plans and it's getting stale.
---
Imagine being low level and having a guy over 100 drop in with a bag full of legendary goodies. Might even be fun to make an alt that had a Goodwill type store where people can come get good weapons and mats for free or close to free! 
---
Waaa I checked everywhere for that code. I'll go back again :) cheers

---
Its all a slow toilet bowl to battle royale, lolz.
---
No, but I did ask the car I was riding in if I could get out at the guard post at the entrance to take a picture with the security "protectron" and they did not let me haha
---
The bag disappearing is a common one for my whole team, we give by trade (begrudgingly) 
---
What I mean is that since they cut all possible costs in developing it, the game has with no doubt paid for itself several times already, and since this was something ''more'', in the sense that it did not take the place of any other planned release it makes no sense to drop it.
---
Even if the revenue from it is only, say, 25% than they thought it would be, it's still a net gain and it will only keep making more money.
---
When I tell them no they get pissed at me saying I'm such a high level it shouldn't matter to me. I told a level 30 no and he left my team then destroyed my Decontamination arch which isn't easy to repair.
---
Ordinance Express (level 31+ Strength perk) maxed (3 pts) makes every explosive 1/10 the weight (that applies to everything that explodes).
---
Batteries Included (level 28+ Intelligence perk) maxed (3 pts) makes all energy weapon ammo (which also applies to fusion cores!) weigh 1/10 the normal weight.
---
Granted, that is 6 points going to things not directly related to combat, but being able to carry 10x the number of missiles, 4mm grenade-launcher ammo, Nuka Grenades and Fat Mans sure can turn around a fight lol
---
Where‚Äôs the ghouls and meat piles ?! 
---
Loved the postüëçüèΩ
---
I doubt many people have tested it. There is a perk card that can increase bash damage by 50% with a 10% chance to cripple. You can also add a bayonet to your weapon to increase bash damage as well certain grips.
---
I can see it being useful if you are a sniper/ranged weapon build and targets get in your face that you have not quite killed yet. You can bash them down quicker than reloading or chambering another round. From my experience, without putting any perk points into bash damage it doesn't almost no damage to high-level targets. But with some perk cards and weapon mods im sure you can ramp up that damage to take down targets you have tagged from range and have got up close.
---
The 180 is probably just your carry weight. When you have a camp or at stations &amp; Red Rocket stations you'll also be able to access your additional stash storage which is 600. 
---
Super Mutants usually drop gunpowder
---
I'm on Xbox. it happens to me on a regular basis since the last patch. If my pip boy fails to load I can't look around. I can fast travel but SOL for everything else. I have to relog and wait around for every flippin thing to load to know that it won't repeat. 
---
I've been quickloading a favorited gun and seeing if I can aim downsight before I attempt to open up my pipboy now.
---
The other bug I've encountered (new to me) was losing all my carry weight (dropped from 235 to 170) upon death. Nothing I did in-game would clear the issue. Relogging did fix that issue tho'
---
Learned that the hard way! LOL
---
yes they did, but ummm I've not see it happen yet... And thanks, helps me not go crazy, lol.  
---
If I missed something, let me know, trying to capture everything.
---
Passives *SERIOUSLY* need to be a thing.
---
Mostly for carry weight reductions.
---
Circuitry is everywhere my dude. Hot plates and telephones being the most common things you'll find. Between those and random military grade circuit boards there are probably hundreds in and around Whitespring alone.
---
Wow.
---
Bethesda thinks "endgame" means the game ends.
---
You can move your camp, even a few feet, pay like 15 caps, and everything should be repaired. The only thing I've seen reported that isn't repaired, is crops.
---
Jim got a ton of push back for doing this back in 2017, so I'll say he has toned it down. Regardless, his youtube and content exists almost solely to cause outrage, and still participates in this cycle.
---
It's a kind of "half-truth" reporting.
---
Imagine this: You know the glitch in BETA when scorched would T-Pose yeah?
---
The way you cause outrage with this while not *lying* explicitly is to get as much footage of the glitch as possible, cut together a video that shows the glitch happening over and over, and then not give an accurate timeframe between incidents - nor give any timing for when it occurred.
---
I don't recall if it was his video directly, but I do remember seeing a video that did exactly that. They heavily implied that ALL scorched in the full release version of the game would T-Pose 100% of the time, to back up their claim that *Fallout 76 was so bad they didn't even finish the animations before shipping it.* 
---
next time it happens outside of VATS let me know, but I thought it was CloseCombat only, so good to know.  
---
...
---
Controller, dang, was hoping it was scroll wheel related, will make a note
---
Thats the tumblr generation that grew up watching Markiplier, so they think most game play involves self narrating and screaming like idiots to an audience of randoms. They are the kids that will answer "what do you want to be when you grow up" with "famous"
---
You can shill both for and against stuff
---
Shills for politician A support A and/or attack A's opponents
---
I like the way ESO handles gear, but I'll admit it's the only MMO I've played so I don't know if anything else is better. 
---
There is a lot of gear. Some can only be obtained from dungeons, and even then you can only get some of the really good dungeon gear by playing that dungeon on a higher difficulty. In 76 this might translate to a set of Overseer's gear we can only get in vault runs.
---
A lot of gear can be found int he overworld, and is often tied to a specific region. In 76 this might look like a higher chance to get Troubleshooter gear from Watoga. 
---
Then there's craftable gear. You can graft regular gear, but you can also craft special sets. Each set requires that you've researched enough special traits (in this case, legendary attributes). So you can find a special crafting station that might let you create Ghoul Slayer's enchanted gear. In order to create a GS leather shoulder, you must have researched *X* traits on the leather shoulder.
---
Another option would be to give players an effect chip like the [Legendary Modification](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4042) mod for Fallout 4. Basically, you can scrap your legendary items and get effect chips. Adding a legendary effect to an item consumes these chips, and the number of chips usually changes based on how good the legendary effect is. So you could eventually craft that Explosive Combat Shotgun, but it's going to take a grind.
---
Make sure your carnivore is active (no rad x, or only negatives bug).  I'm pretty certain I was not getting diseases from spoiled meat when I had carnivore.
---
&gt;Where should I build a camp?
---
That's a matter of preference.  Since you're a low level, I would suggest somewhere out of the way (to avoid traffic from griefers), to the West side of the map (to have the creatures attacking your camp be low level).  You definitely won't want to do it in the bottom right-hand corner.  Not yet.
---
&gt;I keep seeing comments about people's camps being decimated? If your camp is ruined is it just ransacked or is it just you have to start all over again?
---
You can rebuild it for cheaper material costs than it took to build it.  Also, you can chose to move your CAMP like an inch to the left/right and it will be repaired for just the cost of the move.  (Assuming they haven't changed this in the latest patch.)  Hopping servers used to repair your camp too, but it didn't work the last time I tried it.  It may have been a change Bethesda made, or maybe I was just experiencing a glitch of some kind at the time.  But the design of the game is that you click on your CAMP thingamawhatsit and choose "Repair All" and it'll repair everything for the appropriate materials.
---
&gt;I saw on a few threads that the inventory/my stash has been increased to 600 weight however I found a my stash earlier and I had only 180. Is this a gradual/perk thing?
---
No, it should be 600 from the start.  It sounds like you were looking at your carry weight, not your stash size.
---
&gt;What are the benefits/function of having friends/a group?
---
Same as they are in life.  Sometimes they make things easier. Sometimes they're annoying.  It depends on your build (can't use the Lone Wanderer perk in a Team, for example) and how you want to approach the game.  You can play it solo with no issues, it's just a little harder.  Sometimes it's fun to play with the right people.  Certain Events are way harder to complete alone but it can be done.
---
&gt;Where can I find gunpowder?

Gosh, I feel like gunpowder is everywhere.  Enemies are always dropping it for me.  If you're on XBox, message me your GT and I'll give you plenty the next time we're both on.
---
&gt;Also is there any other advice you could recommend?
---
You shouldn't rob a bank without a plan.  You shouldn't use your tongue to stop a fan.
---
Saw video today, there was every special outfit and from which event you get it. Dont remeber single shit from it tho. So if you are interested google boi. 
---
[Here's the next best thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3kAcJruEOs) - shows a lot of the bunker (we weren't allowed to take pictures)
---
Everything looks fine to me, just a normal Bethesda game.
---
I'm excited.  One of my friends quit playing, and another is thinking about quitting.  "Nothing to do" is the reason they gave.
---
I know good solid PVP servers will bring back at least one of those friends to the game.
---
**Your characters MUST transfer over to the new server type though.**  Players are not going to grind up a "new" character every time a new "flavor" of server type comes out.  It's cool if the inventory does NOT transfer or there are NO legendary items.  I think PVP should be more skill based anyways (and yes I have really really nice end-game legendaries on my characters.......TSE, bloodied sledge, cavalier and sentinel and assassin armor).  Use normal weapons and spec your character out accordingly.
---
yeah this is honestly what makes me lose faith the most. Every week I try to see about new content because my group wont hop back on till that - and every week its the same "oh were doing stuff we dont want to say &amp; well tell you more eventually!"   
---
I dont know how it takes them DAYS extra to type up something with 0 information.
---
&gt; Who is he shilling for? And it kinda is his job to shit on the game
---
You're calling them a shilln while claiming they're not a shill
---
What kinda drugs are you on
---
Lol. The game has PvP built in. You can challenge someone, you can hunt Wanted, you can tune into the Hunter/hunted channel, and soon they will have the new PvP only mode. I've had plenty of people attack. They usually take a shot and then wave (or wave and take a shot) to see if I want to engage. If it is even I might, if it is not I'll wave them off. And it usually ends there. Or if I am capturing a workshop and someone wants to challenge me I know we are going to get to fight, so we both go at it.
---
Little shits that use their daddy's credit card to buy a stack of dupped bobbleheads just so they can ambush players or destroy unguarded CAMPs are not participating in PvP. They can't, because their whole strategy is to overpower weaker players, and actually being challenged on even field would be too damaging to their fragile psyche.
---
Yea, there are going to be jerks everywhere. Only time this happend to me some guy was sniping me with a TSE in a nuke zone after rushing into the group of glowing I was fighting and taking all my loot. Killed me because I was stupid enough to engage, and cannibalized me for good measure.... bad day.
---
GT -  Schenck80 
---
I like this. I'm solo but down to help anyone in any way I can.
---
This happened to me the other day, but with a plan instead of a gun.
---
I was trying to give a low level player one of the 2 MG42 plans I just found and dropped it first instead of some junk and the bag completely disappeared.
---
The last time I moved my camp it cost me over 300 caps. All I'm saying is don't be a leach on people because you don't want to do stuff for yourself.
---
erm....don't click them then.
---
&gt;&gt;Nah, see it's a little thing called journalistic integrity. If you just straight-up lie
---
&gt;mm maybe I just don't care as much as other people
---
Seems like it, yeah
---
Thanks!  
---
People are debating if that is a bug or feature, people asked for a "page down" and we are trying to figure out if the wrap around was their attempt to provide it.  Your opinion?
---
Or just wait till you are at the console so you can be accurate :)
---
That's cool but the people who leech at Scorchbeast Queen and go around stealing dead people's paper bags. Those are leechers if any!
---
It would probably be illegal (I would hope) to return the disk, but I swear I'll eat that piece of cardboard.
---
Nope, doesnt work with spoiled meat.
---
Works best on cooked meat.   Not sure if it works on dog food as I have "good doggy" perk
---
I feel you man. Gnomes, bears, bobbleheads, comics.ill take any. Jesus imagine a wall full of these bears...
---
Does radiation also get by assassin armors?  Gonna have to rethink selling legend gamma guns.
---
Very true. Or the people that just sit in the shack and don't help fight the queen and make her impossible to kill.
---
Ni video needed.
---
I know about the events, and i've been farming those two for several weeks. Just interested if anyone actually got it from said events.

From a lore perspective, PVP in this game is kinda silly. We all *just* emerged from Vault 76, supposedly an extremely selective vault filled with the "best and the brightest" and have been coexisting for years without anyone getting murdered, and I guess the wasteland turns us from happy neighbors into raiders instantly.
---
That said, from a gameplay perspective, I wouldn't really have a problem with PVP in FO76, if it were implemented properly. The way it is now, I just leave pacifist on 99% of the time and almost never engage with anyone. The only time I'm forced to is if someone wants to claim one of my workshops, which usually ends with me passively giving up the workshop.
---
I don't have a TSE, so I'm immediately at a disadvantage to a lot of players.
---
Slap damage means my build (sneak sniper) loses its main combat advantage.
---
The clunky UI makes it a chore to turn Pacifist on and off quickly, at least on PC.
---
I'd prefer no PVP to what is there now, but if some of the stupid and/or counter-intuitive things were to be fixed, I'd happily play on a PVP server.
---
That said, I have a lot more fun helping out my fellow Vault Dwellers than murdering them... unless they try to take over my lead mine.
---
You can use class freak to reduce the negative effects of mutations. 
---
Yeah, but the drop rate is so ridiculously low. Ridiculously low for all outfits to drop at any event/daily. :/
---
You sound like a legitimate reason for me to pvp more.  Who takes a workshop,  after spending 2 hrs collecting junk,  doesn't stash it,  doesn't run away from newcomers when flagged for pvp .. Haha . Shit .no but seriously,  always stash your junk.  I know it makes travel times longer , but better safe than sorry 
---
So here's my idea on creatable legendaries. First, you need a perk, unlocked at level 50. First level takes 2 points, and allows you to add 1 star legendary mods, with a second and third level for 2 and 3 star effects. Next, you need to learn the plan for the legendary effects you want to add, by scrapping items with those effects, with a very low chance of learning anything. Obviously, you need the materials; stable fluxes, ultracite, titanium... maybe something new, a new metal or mineral or something, like adamantium, or vibranium, or unobtanium, or whatever. And then in order to add a legendary mod, the item would have to be used. Something like the enclave commendation quest. You would add the mod at a crafting bench, but it wouldn't actually gain the effect until you killed x number of legendaries or scorchbeasts with the item equipped. You need to do it separately for each legendary item and for each legendary effect you wanted to add.
---
Missed one with clothing / armor , on legendary effects 20% reduction weight of chems does not work 
---
There really should be a way to prevent this. Just let them be static objects in the workshop. If they "feed" from the normal building limit it wouldnt even make a difference performancewise.
---
If everyone can craft legendary weapons, this weapons will stop be legendary and EVERYBODY will run with TSE guns with 90% weigh reduction.
---
That's all.
---
very interesting, i will follow this topic i want to know  if i can clear silo faster
---
What gaming system do you play on?
---
I think high level players go to the train station near there and the enemies scale up. Just try server hopping or do some quests in the ash heap and toxic valley for awhile. 
---
The legendary system needs a complete overhaul and to move away from RNG so we actually earn legendary items instead of just striking it lucky. Make legendary effects modded only, but not learnable through plans or scrapping. There could be a unique quest or challenge for each legendary effect, which would have to be completed using the item you wanted to learn the effect for. A simple example would be for the bloodied effect - kill X amount of legendary enemies while at low health, though Bethesda could probably come up with something better. Legendary enemies should no longer drop legendary weapons/armour but could instead drop new materials which would be used to craft legendary mods.
---
Additionally, legendary items should be character bound (or account bound if we ever get a shared stash). This would ensure only players who have earned a given legendary effect can use it, while also combating RMT; or at least the weapons/armour side of it.
---
Make 400 plus damage 
---
They should code it so at level 15 luck the game 20% of the time will drop a weapon with TSE or rare armor; problem would be solved IMO.  Make luck really be worth maxing out.  I‚Äôm at 8 on mine and still get level 45-50 weapons but never seen a TSE drop in my 310 levels.
---
It sounds like you're all set, especially since you tend to get map markers and MISC objectives if you venture near areas with quests. Depending on your platform, you get achievements / trophies for Monster Mash at Watoga High School and Queen of the Hunt at the hunter's shack in the Mire / north of the bogs, but it wouldn't surprise me if you've found both of them already. 
---
I'm thinking that as well tbh, sick of Battle Royal games. 
---
Fucking SOE (daybreak) ruined h1z1 the PVE servers were amazing, could have been a really successful mmo if they'd have been patient but John Smedly strikes again and wanted to get in on that PUBG's style micro transactions.
---
I can only imagine the uproar when they announce a Battle Royal game mode as the first content being added, i doubt the people that even bother with pvp in 76 would want a Battle royal mode, there not interested in fair fights  much raiders lol
---
Probably an AI like Mr. New Vegas.
---
I had an experience in which server hopping didn't work. My wife and I were playing last weekend, she's level 27 and I'm 34. We were griefed by two level 100's, first hit us with an orbital strike and I immediately fast traveled to my CAMP. Before I could block them, they followed me and DESTROYED my camp in a matter of seconds. I said screw it, logged out to the title screen, and my wife stayed in the server laughing at them as they shot her, trying to initiate combat. She honestly almost died, they were taking her down quick.  
---
She logged out, we both logged in. Maybe we joined the same server we left, maybe they somehow followed us to another server, but those assholes were IMMEDIATELY attacking us again right when we logged in. We blocked them right away and even wrote their names on a piece of paper in case they somehow get around the block.   
---
We haven't played since. We've loved this game, bought a second Xbox to play together and it's my wife's first Fallout experience. But this absolute dickery really left a sour taste in our mouths.
---
sorry you bought the wrong game :(
---
Srap the broken crop and you get one crop and one fertilizer, so you can replant it for free... this game is wacky.
---
Let's please not make dogs into a premium item and instead implement a robust character building system that allows you to have a canine companion as part of your character build.
---
&gt; . I got a ghoul slayers gamma gun though. Beat that!
---
Take that to whitesprings nukes and really have some fun with the players there. I wonder how much it will heal the ghouls for.
---
I wish more people thought like this.  I really enjoy that fo76 isn't a happy safe utopia where you know beyond a doubt that NO one can ever hurt you or take your stuff. I just assume a lot of the ppl who are upset with pvp on here don't like real life at all and would rather escape into a fantasy world where nothing bad ever happens . Sadly , fo76 isnt that place and I'm thankful for it.  There are plenty of other mmorpgs that are pve only.  
---
 Robobrain: ‚ÄúI have calculated your chance of survival, and....  well, I don‚Äôt want to be morbid.‚Äù
---
Thanks for the heads up. I need to test this out. I remember it being a concern when they patched the relog to refill core exploit since it was not part of their game design.
---
I sometimes wish they kept it in. It always felt like a consolation prize to a server not responding crash 
---
i had one, and made a ton of plasma cores, but the damn thing just kept breaking even though i had lvl 5 gunsmith...just dont get why some guns vreak ALL the time, and other never break.  I get the auth-granade launcher will break when you try to fire too many rounds.  Maybe same with the plasma gatling...i was just holding the fire button to obliterate something.
---
I like weightless as it is.  I already have weight management problems.  I'm on a diet but adding more fat to my character wouldn't help me :)
---
If you're a 2 handed melee having trouble with smaller crowd enemies (dogs, mole rats, crickets, etc) use the Pitchfork!  Find a legendary one with 40% swing speed.  It's perfect for smaller enemies with lower health bars.  I have a 3 Star Anti-Armor / Swing Speed / Some crappy 3rd perk one that I use all the time, works like a charm!
---
I'm not struggling, but if they promise me something I expect it. They even placed the expectation is a few days in their initial contact.
---
You mean minus the bobblehead exploit right?
---
Never heard of them actually spawning in the world. But, they are a very rare, VERY RARE, reward chance from most Forest region events/dailies. You don't need a new character to farm the events to get it. Just need patience and a lot of luck.
---
I need a cool Eyebot tbh.
---
Bethesda probably won't since Obsidian outdid them with a game that had only about 2 years (iirc) of dev time. Bethesda just wants to act like NV never happened.
---
I did that engage thing as a lvl 6 and got eaten by a lvl11  I was so pissed at myself for falling for it.  In nuke events if I see someone go down, usually stand on the bag till they return.
---
I think only the bolt action pipe rifle gets both rifle and pistol perk boosts.   
---
I would like to know this as well. Look forward to the  replies.
---
Would be good to know.
---
I know there are a lot of terminals to hack to mess with the turrets, but I didn't look for much else.
---
The main problem, I think, is that the players are not self-sufficient. The player needs to eat, drink, repair his weapon, get ammo and chems somewhere. And although this ‚Äúfits perfectly‚Äù into the post-apocalyptic world, this system has one drawback ‚Äî it is boring.
---
In fact, you have two options. You can farm so many cartridges, materials, and drugs all at once that you don‚Äôt have to think about where to get them if they suddenly ran out.
---
Or you can carry the bare minimum with you, but then you regularly have to look for everything you need. And this is not fun. It literally makes you quit ‚Äúanything interesting, what are you doing,‚Äù and go routinely to get it all in order to get yourself some fun afterwards.
---
Give the players a mod that will restore hunger and thirst and it will become the most popular one. Make a perk that will periodically repair the weapon in your inventory ‚Äî every second player will use it. The game looks exactly like this ‚Äî as a constant alternation of fun content and very boring, routine and annoying content.
---
The players who collect a lot of resources are called ‚Äúhoarders‚Äù. Just because a person wants to remove this annoying element from his gaming experience: the need to constantly carry out a set of routine actions that will make it possible to return to the fun. Seriously, we do not have a post-apocalypse simulator. We have a game here, whose main task is to entertain. What is fun to go to the farm spot over and over again and get the materials to repair the broken weapon again and again and again?
---
The amount of water, food, ammo, chems ‚Äî it's just a numbers. They do not even need to be stored as items in the inventory. Damn it, guys, just make it numbers tied to the character!
---
They should do it, but not tell anyone, so dupers waste 50 at the same time
---
&gt; Where should I build a camp? 
---
Ideally a place where you won't be always attacked. if your new, there's lots of places around Flatwood that are good. The dried up river bed running to the west is a good place. 
---
&gt; I keep seeing comments about people's camps being decimated? If your camp is ruined is it just ransacked or is it just you have to start all over again? 
---
People can attack your camp, and do enough damage to destroy it in all, or partially. You can go to your C.A.M.P. device that you set down, and select Repair all. Repairs are cheaper in cost. But you must have all the materials you need. If you are short, just run around and collect them. 
---
&gt; I saw on a few threads that the inventory/my stash has been increased to 600 weight however I found a my stash earlier and I had only 180. Is this a gradual/perk thing? 
---
You personal carry inventory and stash box are two seperate things. The 180 sounds like your max weight which you can see via your pipboy. When you go to your stash box, select the transfer option. Now you can see how much you have stored in your stash box. It was 400, it's been upped to 600. We all have the same, there's no way to increase it at this time. They have said they will increase it again at some point. 
---
&gt; What are the benefits/function of having friends/a group? 
---
Things are easier to do. You can take on creatures higher level. You can share perks you have with your group, giving them the benefit of the perk if they don't have it. Effectively you can get 1-3 extra perks. Some perks give you a bonus for being in a group. And it's fun. 
---
&gt; Where can I find gunpowder? 
---
You can find it on some creatures. Like super mutants. You can also make it, at a tinkers bench. You can also buy it from some of the vendor bots. It's easy enough to find and or make. 
---
&gt; Also is there any other advice you could recommend? 
---
Explore everything, don't rush. When you find a new location, after taking out the creatures there, look everywhere. You will find things you really want, like plans to make things, recipes to cook things. 
---
Learn how to manage your inventory early on, so it becomes a good habit. Don't fall into the habit of grabbing everything and scrapping it and storing it. That way you end up with lots of stuff you don't need all that much off. Then you are always overburdened, or your stash box is maxxed out. 
---
If you get higher level gear and weapons, scrap them. You really don't need to save them for  when you get that level, because there will always be something new coming along, or you will be able to make your own better weapons. Scrapping armor and weapons teaches you modifications (mods). Mods make armor and weapons better. 
---
Get a notebook and keep a list of mods you learn as you play. This will save you some frustration when you buy a mod you don't think you have, but you go to learn it, and it turns out you already know it. Can't return stuff you bought from a vendor bot. 
---
Learn what junk gives you what. This will save you frustration when you suddenly realize you need 300 springs or screws, and only have 30-50. The junk is placed smartly in this world. For example, fans and typewriters are great for screws and gears. Office buildings and such always have a decent amount of them.
---
Some resources you don't really need to store in your stash box. Like wood. If you are in the forest, mire or toxic valley, gathering wood is so easy. A few minutes and you often have enough.
---
Those are the top of my head tips. 
---
https://youtu.be/HBPrSO0w7As   i may try 10min without killing mobs, but i have weak weapons now to do it.
---
Swaggity swag, i cant comprehend,
---
How can they not implement us a stand.
---
Swag is used in german as well. And wouldnt it make no sense too go that far of a stretch with a translation? Im afraid it was just careless/accidental..
---
Ugh that's bugged too (like half the game.) The cost is based on how far you walked while in the place mode. So enter the mode, find where you want to place it, exit the mode and without moving. Re-enter the mode. Then it should cost the base moving price.
---
Thanks man and will do. I can tell you I‚Äôve encountered it shooting at a ranged flying scorchbeast multiple times. Just can‚Äôt remember if I was in VATS. 
---
I've reached out twice and not gotten a response. I might mage a new ticket and reference the existing one to see if I can get some traction.
---
Grahm, be safe.
---
not sure I agree with 20%, but I'd jump on board with an increase multi-Star rate...  
---
With as 15 luck I get (1) 3\* for every 3 or 4 a couple of my friends get, off the same NPC's, and their lucks are 3 and 5
---
There definitely is a way to glitch straight to the end.  You can launch all three silos in about 30 minutes.  It involves placing your power armor down outside the map, getting into it, walking a tiny tiny line between sections of the silo, and dropping in through the ceiling into the final room without doing any of the A/B/C steps.
---
You're doing it as fast as you really can do it without cheating.
---
Oh, you seemed like you needed the money or something. My bad.
---
Really?  
---
Good to know, let me test in game and I'll add.
---
Stacking bobbleheads isn't a good mechanic though, it's an obvious bug/oversight. You can't even stack chems in this game, which *was* a legit mechanic in previous games.
---
They can craft gunpowder at a chemistry station - it only costs acid and cloth, both of which are fairly abundant. 
---
Class!!!!!
---
You're not affected by your friend not playing. Then you're just playing on your own. Big whoop. Why would you stop being friends with someone over a video game? That sounds pretty immature. 
---
People say the shredding minigun is good for bash.
---
Aren't the DLC supposed to be free aswell?
---
I'm level 177 and low levels just run away from me when I'm trying to drop stuff for them...
---
Guess the tattered mole outfit and chainsaw doesn't help.
---
Solution for you! Wear a tattered mole outfit and wield a chainsaw.
---
They work if you read them properly.
---
Have you been to Fort Defiance? I found one of each, minus maybe one, not sure. And that's where I found em. 
---
Same sentiment, here.  I‚Äôve been playing Fallout since the original game was released in 1997, and I own a copy of every Fallout game.  The decision to get 76 was a tough one because I had to overcome my hatred of MMOs to do so‚Äîand, honestly, sometimes I question whether I made the right decision.
---
Being online with other people is the *least* enjoyable aspect of playing 76, and I wouldn‚Äôt do it if I wasn‚Äôt forced to.
---
And google power armor silo glitch. But that is not legit was to do record.
---
In one of his monologues, he remembers that it's just Chally poop. :shrug
---
Damn, I love the location! 
---
The only thing I would change is the Nuka Cola posters by the bed, they seem very crowded in there. It looks more lie a Nuka shrine than it does a bedroom... I may have to make a Nuka Shrine now.
---
Yup, down from a group of around 12 of us that used to play regular to just me and 1 other daily now.
---
Were stubborn though and both hugh fallout fans that can see the potential, empty vague statements that say nothing whilst they push stuff on the Atom store though is very annoying and seem's intentional.
---
Love at first bite.....
---
It kinda depends.  If it's three 100 plus level characters and ten level 50 and below characters, yes that does hurt the process.  The SBQ scales to "how many people are in the zone".  So the 3 higher level characters probably could've completed it if 10 lower level characters weren't in the zone.
---
On a side note they should change the SBQ scaling to take into account both the NUMBER of players and the LEVELS of those players.  Make it a fair fight no matter who shows up :)
---
Post the definition of affected for me please because you seem to be confusing it with other words lol
---
still doesn't report it, you have to look at the DR.
---
I've had 1 PVP engagement and that was when I stole someone's workshop. I wasn't entirely aware of what that meant (reading warnings is for chumps!), but next thing I knew some guy twice my level was charging at me in power armor and beating the shit out of me
---
RMT duper trash.
---
Report him
---
I can dream... (sigh)
---
I just hit level 210 and I'm a walker. I walk everywhere to see things. Ive not once seen Grahm. Still angry.
---
autocorrected behind my back. 
---
Not trying to glitch it 
---
This game has the worst loot drops since Diablo III vanilla. The fact of how that game was blasted, but praised once RoS (loot 2.0) came out shows how anyone defending the current state is objectively wrong.
---
You can't help when turds want to be turds, so I would suggest building some where off the beaten path. As good as building on a resource generator seems it's almost pointless as they don't hold much. 
---
I can't speak for your stash or personal inventory weight as lots of folks have problems with inventory management that usually lead back to them not being able to let go of things they don't need or have to many of.
---
Playing with a group is good if you want but you can play this game mostly solo. If you have friends playing get together, this game is good alone but amazing with friends. If you going to go solo make sure you get the lone wanderer perk in charisma, and if you on a team you can swap it for inspational for bonus xp. I won't spoil mutations for you but they get better when your on a team.
---
Gunpowder can easily be crafted at any chemistry bench, but if you don't have one early on that ok head to the Northwest corner of the map and your will find a lumber mill with super mutants they seem to drop a good amount. Also I would suggest melee for the first while in game to stock up on ammo. Once you do start collecting gunpowder or making it make sure not to hoard it because it adds up fast.
---
Now thing that I recommend are simply have fun take your time and remember if you don't have junk on you don't waste a stimpack in the over world just respawn. Go into your junk tab with some junk in your inventory and mark things like screws gears springs and ballistics fiber you'll thank yourself later.( acid doesn't hurt to mark for making gunpowder later)
---
Welcome to Appalachia friend, good luck out there.
---
There not worth the effort at all and they do too much damage to armour. When I had the same idea I went through 5 guns and about 6000+ ammo. There the worst mob by far and huge huge bullet sponges.
---
Dropped a mini nuke with mirv on one and it didn't even blink.
---
not trying to glitch, let me watch this
---
Thank you this sums up my opinion. Especially the last paragraph.
---
Or, Dusty Hill from ZZ Top and use a guitar sword as my primary weapon!
---
Love this!
---
Oooooh spiceeey!
---
Its way more broken, day one since fallout3
---
I think that was more meant to take away from the fact he left a stash around. Cause he starts talking about keeping a secret stash then quickly recants. 
---
Guess that leads some to believe that somewhere along his route there's a secret stash that was "Graham's stash" that can be found. Maybe a secret home for him too. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Perfecto. I should be around this weekend and will give you a shout.
---
Dont quit your day Job.
---
That's awesome!
---
Did you ask any of the staff about Fallout 76 etc?
---
So like wasteland santa?
---
This POS again? He needs to banned from reddit via ip.
---
Here's how you react to that situation: "Aw, man. Sorry you don't like the game. I do, and I'm gonna keep playing it myself and see if I can find someone online who'll play with me, but we'll still keep playing other games we both like together. "
---
Wait, in bunker number 2, you stacked the 2x1 staircase? Since when can you do that? I‚Äôve been trying to do that since the beginning, and the one time it worked it was because I finessed it, but it couldn‚Äôt support floors.
---
Very cool
---
Wasnt using any rad x or radshield
---
I think the upvote version of Oblivion is Sovngarde or more generally Aetherius
---
I like that approach. Mostly low levels have just clipped a CAMP.
---
Man, you've missed all the fun! You should be very thankful 
---
It seems broken.  One or two people have confirmed One of Us as the quest they got it from.  Realistically that takes 2 to farm and soaks up a good hour just listening to Modus prattle on.   
---
A user on Xbox confirmed he got the leather coat from Mire events but doesn‚Äôt remember which because he was focused on the field jacket.   The odds of even ending up in the cosmetics table is abysmal.  I‚Äôve yet to even see a consolation prize (the wrong coat, pompador wig etc). 
---
Yea dog food works for me
---
Selling items for real money is not allowed here. And btw, you are a duping piece of shit
---
are you selling this for cash? gtfo scum  
---
I'd be fine with this so long as it required insane amounts of farming

Thank you so much this is really helpful. I'm on PS. I am kind of relieved you can play it solo although there is such a lonely vibe to the game when you are just wandering. 
---
Everything you said was literally your own fault.
---
1) If you are on a team and in Pacifist; you should ABSOLUTELY ensure everyone else is. If your friend want to PvP; you do too buddy.
---
2) Pacifist should never take workshops. Ever. go hunt for spots to drop your camp. there are extractor spots for your CAMP everywhere.
---
How you want it is exactly how it was a month ago. Guess what? People used Pacifist mode to grief everyone; even people in Pacifist Mode.
---
1a) You are playing PvP? You got someone with a bounty? Lesskeddit! BLAM! 200C's BABY! Yes! Oh no. Here comes his buddy. SHOOT HIM! *slap damage* Keep pouring bullets! he can't do any...SLEDGEHAMMERED! Loot stolen. Cap reward.
---
2a) You are in Pacifist Mode? You got a Workshop? Cool. Now comes another guy who wants your workshop. He, himself, is in Pacifist mode. PvP has engaged. Your bullets do nothing. He kills you.
---
You want a pacifist experience. Make sure you are a pacifist. Don't party with people in PvP mode. Tell them you are a pacifist. You get your based ROCKED!? Go play a little more. I complain about resources for power armor. You can pick you CAMP up and drop it down to reset everything to full health too! You will have to rebuild, but you don't have to get the stuff to fix it.
---
This aspect is to keep people playing. When people have already completed everything; they have nothing better to do. Idle Hands. I am not saying they are right, but I know how Pacifist Mode has been abused in the past.
---
tl;dr - If you truly are a *Pasifist*; role play as such.
---
Thanks so much. Now to find a chemistry station!

Thats very cool!

As long has he doesn't emulate [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ieq8IB0kCwA) we are fine.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind a quest unlocking similar to the scorched effect quest to find the plans to be able to craft them all over the map. 
---
So long as there's no other mobs around other wise they ignore you and be line for the Sam and those things won't shoot at any thing with in 10 feet.

Ive been looking for a chainsaw, any location tips?
---
&gt; Field Scientist
---
Cant find anything on that are you sure thats what its called?
---
This I‚Äôve been trying to warn people on reddit and whenever I‚Äôm in game.
---
Do a bag test first 
---
Drop something worthless first 
---
Make sure bag is there
---
Open bag 
---
Add items 
---
Notify other player is safe to grab.
---
Don‚Äôt let the other player open or grab something before you‚Äôre done or it will disappear 
---
You can definitely do better than 137 damage with just rifle perks and an appropriate rifle.
---
how'd you get all this stuff?
---
400 hours in and best i found are either TS or E weapons, but not both.
---
you trading/buying it?
---
I completely agree, nothing more frustration than you and a friend working through a nuke base, typing in the coordinates, launching the nuke then getting disconnected as we fast travel to the area.  Yes we can get the codes again but it just seems like what‚Äôs the point of going through the trouble to find them again if there‚Äôs a chance of the same thing happening again.  It‚Äôs all discouraging.
---
Sure if ya like!
---
If i was Santa though and you only left purified water for me i'd blow your base up ; )
---
You pretty much covered it all. I'd add that if you're using ranged combat to grab all the guns you can find and scrap them for a chance of unlocking mods which can add a punch to your current weaoons. Plus you'll get a lot of steel, too. 
---
Pharma Pharma is great at all levels, but especially when starting out. (Its in Luck) gives you a chance to find another med in med containers. Just make sure to press the Search button for it, it doesn't do it automatically. 
---
This drove me crazy. I ended up running out of materials.
---
What I did was come back later with all of them made ahead of time.
---
Guess i'd be better off farming One of Us then.
---
And i don't really want to spent countless hours for a piece of imaginary apparel.
---
It‚Äôs obvious who are the griefers and who made a mistake. No need in punishing the ones who made mistake.
---
Agree with OP
---
In most fallout games cannibalism is a thing but until I heard a holo tape of a kid talking about "having food", it clicked and I felt like shit hearing that a kid would have to resort to cannibalism.
---
It is by far the best armor for stealth builds - so there's that.
---
You really need to farm or trade for better legendary weapons.  137 for a rifle is really low, like non-legendary low.  If you need better weapons go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  You can trade things you have and collect for better gear and caps.
---
Just a FYI but my fully min / maxed melee character with a Bloody / Swing Speed Super Sledge still doesn't dent the bar with each hit.  The SBQ must have 20,000 or so hit points and a TON of damage resist.  It's all about continued beating more than anything.  Keep firing and fighting.  Stay AWAY from buildings and trees so she'll land and the melee characters can help.  Nothing is more frustrating than seeing 10 people in the little fort down there and the queen won't land for 90% of the fight...........while the melee sit there and waste attacks on trash mobs that show up.
---
Have you played Diablo III and Diablo III RoS? 
---
One game was basically near dead, and nothing good dropped. One version of the game was thriving, and had great loot drops occasionally. 
---
He trashes fallout 76 like it isnt his opinion but is a cold hard fact and it pisses me off how he comes across!
---
I did tell her I was the reason our group was there because I was a fan of the game, and she talked a little about the big event Bethesda held at the hotel/bunker when the game launched.
---
She was an older woman who bought the game for her grandkids but said they hadn't even played it yet haha. She also adorably called the Vault Boy "Fallout Guy" but I knew exactly what she meant.
---
I did not get the sense that they get a lot of video-game related tourism, based on how fancy all of the children I saw around the hotel were dressed.
---
Create an angle roof with windows , half pane , just like a real warehouse
---
Cloth + acid = gunpowder
---
Which I regularly run out of making ammo
---
This is fair! I have been trying to trawl through the threads. I am really enjoying it so far and I think it's going to be great. 
---
well, you got yourself a ‚Äúmounted‚Äù trophy
---
To be honest, I think you are still better than my new stealth rifle char.  I want to say my two shot lever shows 240 dmg, but that is with a standard receiver.
---
it looks like you're doing everything normal without skipping any of the steps, I was told there was a way to do it without having to fix the pipes or destroying the cores
---
I'm on Ps4. 
---
Where do I find both items please - I know I haven't seen either one of them.  Unless by chainsaw you mean the Ripper?
---
Darn, I'd join ya if I could
---
That is so cool!!
---
I agree with this, but only after they fix the sensitivity of the Wanted system. Last week I got "wanted" status for defending another guy's camp from mole rats. The base owner wasn't around, and I was trying to be a good samaritan. I shot the mole rats but apparently "destroyed" 2 or 3 crops when shooting at it, giving me 3x wanted status for trying to help. And for shopting a fucking potato.
---
The only reason why i don't like this idea is because there basically is no end-game in fo76 right now. So farming for your perfect gear is pretty much all there is left to do. Maybe once they add more content.
---
You need all three rifleman perks maxed out in addition to bloodied mess. Also helps to have adrenal reaction which increases damage as you lose hp. Adrenaline and nerd rage will help as well. 
---
Be sure the rifle you are using also is max level and has hardened receiver on it for more damage. 
---
Yes you can. Slightly southeast of the gillman lumber mill. Cat there almost every time.
---
MyPeeSacIsFull did a good job at answering your questions, so for the "other advice" section, I'd recommend just following along with the main quest line, but, take diversions and do the miscellaneous quests when you can. You do get access to some good vendors toward the end of the story quests, but otherwise, it isn't essential for you to race through the story quests. 
---
When it comes to inventory management, it is really tempting to hoard everything, and that's fine when you're first starting out. Once you fill up that stash with 600 pounds though, you can prune out what you really don't need. Ammo has weight, so only keep 2 or 3 types - the stuff you use. You can bulk your junk, and a good rule of thumb is to only keep around 5 to 10 bulk junk of the various things. Excess weapons and armors should be scrapped so that you can learn mods, with legendary weapons and armors you're not using, and excess bulk junk and aid items and food, sold to vendors.
---
I am with you on the Bed, Beth ,and Beyond.
---
Yes, I hate seeing wood armor.  I won't even pick it up for gifts for noobies.
---
I don't want them to get the idea that wood trash is something they "should" wear.....lol
---
Dang, I wished that worked with the deathclaws :/
---
If very short.
---
He's a duper
---
No doubt.  Only problem with One of Us is not knowing if it the reward is leveled.  I‚Äôve done it a few times and gotten recipes.  Which after 2 quests back to back feels less rewarding than event hopping.  
---
It‚Äôs fucked really.  Like someone forgot to move a decimal. 
---
From what I've heard people really didn't like it when it was released and it was full of bugs. I wasn't into the series at that point though so I can't say for sure.
---
Finally a use for the thousands of .38 rounds I have
---
Not swag, but shwag, lol. Only one letter, but it does change the meaning of the word.  
---
And video game translations sometimes end up being pretty darn different between regions, so it honestly wouldn't surprise me. 
---
That's where I'll be playing, hopefully not gettin one-shot the whole time lol
---
If your on ps4 fight me or come help!!!
---
What you are mentioning helped save all of the games you listed. Many of which were near desolate.
---
**Smart.**
---
You can always add some salt to their bag as well.
---
My fianc√© is taking me for my birthday and I‚Äôm so flipping excited. Now I‚Äôm even more!
---
One in Cranberry Bog, at the Ranger District Office. It's in the shed in the back with the cages in it. Spawns on an opened footlocker. 
---
One in Clarksburg, top floor of hardware store, on a shelf above safe. 
---
Basement in Mountainside Bed and Breakfast. 
---
Have fun! Players can hear it revving &gt;:D
---
Yeah, something like the [Atomic Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQF3DK-GZ1Y) mod for Fallout 4, that was my favorite Radio Station in all of Fallout history. 
---
Only if they take it personal!
---
the title, the story, i found myself laughing thank you man
---
That must be it about the weight I just was a bit confused. I haven't come across any super mutants yet but am excited to now.
---
230 hours in this makes me very happy that there is such mileage from it!
---
I don't mind enemies I just reached level 5 where other players can attack me and I have the heebie jeebies sweats when I meet another person.
---
Thanks for the advice! 
---
I've only had one. And I had to actually wait a few minutes before shooting back cause I was in disbelief.. "is this dude really shooting me on purpose??"
---
I've even accidentally shot people point blank in the face a couple times in the heat of it when they've come up behind me and not had pvp happen... was a "whoops! Sorry!"
---
if you played it till level 85 then the game is in no way shape or form worth f2p,you got your money worth 
---
After the nerf this won't be true. There are far more powerful combos.
---
Thank you! I am level 302 and only picked up chainsaws a couple of times. 
---
I mean it'll be hillariously painful if they'll just add it as world drop in future DLC.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.
---
Buy and sell stuff to other players there.
---
If you get good enough at it, and figure out what people want, and go sell it to them..................goodbye vendor runs.  The only time I ever sell to vendors now is if I'm accidentally standing next to one and need to drop weight.  Usually not even then, I just drop the items for someone else to find.
---
I haven't sold anything to a vendor in ages.  I probably made 20,000 caps yesterday selling serums, power armor mods, ammo, junk, etc.
---
Disagreement. 
---
I assume they have more pressing issues to deal with than a stash increase. Personally, I have 4 sets of PA, thousands of rounds of various ammo types (including 15+ FC's) and tons of scrap/armor/weapons and still manage to keep my stash and inventory below max.
---
You may just need to learn how to let go of all that junk. It's not like there's ever a shortage to be found in the world. Sounds more like an issue with your playstyle not being able to adapt to a more limited inventory system.
---
You're going to have a BLAST!! Are you staying in the hotel as well?
---
I picked a fight with a scorchbeast near a fissure site once, got it to maybe 20% health, and it flew off out of combat, regained its health and attacked again. never landed either, just spammed its sonic blast attack. Each time I got it to 20% hp it would fly off for a bit then circle back. I was finally able to kill it but I kept imagining it was some bethesda employee who took control of a beast just to mess with people.
---
Oh yeah. Been server hopping a lot there. 
---
Found the brown, green, and white (the clean version). No luck on the others. May give up :( 
---
What's funny is that I'm not even going to wear them much...I just want them for some odd reason.
---
Well yeah thats the point of grindy/looty games like this. You play for a long time and get rewarded with amazing loot. The issue comes when you play for a long time and get NOTHING, like current FO76 and other games that died.
---
I always leave one of my purifiers unlocked.
---
North west side of the map, Deathclaw island has a Deathclaw almost every time
---
you had me in the first half but i love where this went
---
This is my only real concern for the new mode is gettin one-shot n losing potentially more than jus caps and junk now.. I've been grinding too but still have nothing that's gonna save me lol. See you on the new servers I hope
---
No, I feel you. Currently have every piece of clothing in the game I've come across, just sitting in my stash and taking up valuable space, no fucks given.
---
But yeah, other than FD, I don't have any tips. What system you on? 
---
i don't even think it is a matter of levels. I think some people are just shitty like that. was playing with some kid that a buddy of mine and i added to the team. he was level 30-50, i don't quite remember. i was level 70-80 and my buddy was maybe ten levels or so below me. he had a TSE weapon and was 1-2 shotting enemies. at this point, my buddy and i have maybe 1-2 one star legendaries that we use. our whitesprings strategy at this point is cripple legs with shotguns so they drop and don't move, then clean up with melee. because of this, shells are very valuable for us. we often waste all of our plastic making them, and always take over the amo factory when starting a session.
---
the kid asked us for a few random supplies, which we immediately gave him with no hesitation and wanting nothing in return. he finally goes "can i have some shotgun shells?" my buddy and i both go "ooooooooo‚Ä¶ uh..." we apologize, tell him that we would gladly give up almost anything else, and then explained their value to us. he got a little sour about it and i said, "tell you what, man. I haven't seen shells being sold by vendors for less than 4 caps (still don't know if that's the lowest they go for to this day) Ill sell you shells for 2 caps a piece. if they sell for cheaper, ill go as low as a cap per shell." he goes "WOOOOOOOW.NO.THANKS." he ends up being bitter about it and his demeanor changed for the rest of the session.
---
some people are just entitled kids. some of them are literally kids. that guy couldn't have been older than 14. and that's being nice.
---
Or a clean version on the Atom shop. ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Yep, noticed that. Also the same as my TSE pump shotty, with "90% reduced weight" that still weighs 9.2lbs
---
I have all three ranks of rifleman maxed. I got 1 into bloody mess and I have two into adrenal reaction. 
---
I can remember most my perks but not all. 
---
My problem is I‚Äôm fully parked out for a melee build too. Rocking 500 damage per swing with everything set up right. I can take out a level 91 glowing deathclaw with 4 swings. 
---
My only issue is ‚Äúme hammer! Me smash!‚Äù
---
Not very sophisticated. 
---
But the damage gap between melee and rifle is so big I don‚Äôt wana change it.
---
Its a thing
---
Are you sure you're not in borderless window mode rather than full screen? Shouldn't revert to the default after update, but who knows. 
---
North - northeast of silo Charlie, there's a house on the map. 
---
Ha!  Jokes on you, I dont even have a door. XD
---
Because you can join off a recent player to get back in, I can‚Äôt imagine it would be super difficult to keep track of the most recent server too and add a button
---
I kept hearing people rave about it so I went to some length to get the plan. Pretty disappointed, mine does like 55 dmg, takes a lot of shots to take down some basic enemies. I can't keep 556 on hand. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
---
I have 5 max on demolition 
---
Yes. I have purchased the plan twice, learned it the first time. The second time it wouldn't let me learn it and I still cannot build said plan.
---
I don‚Äôt know, I have enough materials to make 3. I‚Äôll wait. 
---
"Smashy smashy!"
---
I think you're supposed to submit a ticket with Bethesda for issues like this.
---
I totally agree. But as you say:
---
&gt; BETHESDA. I would pay good $ for a dog. 
---
They have us all in a junkie build, and we don't even realize it. But as our withdrawal pains grow ever sharper ‚Äî as we murmur "Who's a good boy? Dogmeat's a good boy!" in our sleep ‚Äî we'll gladly buy many, many Atoms just for a handsome canine fix/companion.
---
Being in a world at all allows you to interfere with others. Pvp allows a recourse, albeit not a great one. What you are proposing would turn passive mode into a griefing engine.
---
Blow up other players' stuff -&gt; get teammate to kill you -&gt; passive mode. Now you're untouchable and off scott free.
---
This is true for a lot of the locations in the game.  As a kid, I used to go to Camden Park all the time, and it's so uncanny to see it in a video game.  
---
My stepdad came over (and being an outdoors-man all his life, he barely watches TV let alone know anything about games) so I showed him the game without even telling him the game was based on WV.  He looked at the screen and said "What are you doing?  That's the town of Grafton.   Is that in a video game?" He KNEW it was Grafton just by the looks alone.  He was able to name every building.
---
The same is true with the Capitol building.  I can point out the courtyard where I go and have lunch with my friend who works there.
---
Makes me happy.  
---
Also, fantastic job on the pictures and poses!!!!
---
Adrenal reaction is a mutation. Alot of the high damge numbers you see are a combination of maxed perk cards, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, and bloodied. 
---
Ill run some numbers later at low hp and get specifics, but it is possible to increase weapon damage by a lot.
---
There is no option for pockets on power armour. Granted I can add extra carry weight through calibrated shocks but both options mean losing out on using something else purely because we have to carry so much around with us which again is down to the miniscule stash size.
---
i keep hearing this Duping stuff...how do they do that?
---
Yeah I placed one of the plans that it would allow me to place on my patio. I just would like to have everything inside.
---
Not if the option was only able to be activated at the main menu. People can grief and then leave the game. There‚Äôs no difference.
---
Right, I'd be cool with a means of using stable flux, odd ball animal parts and other less common stuff to "enchant" armor and weapons.
---
I do know that luck affects two things:
---
1. Legendary drop and item drop durability bars.  More luck = more durability on found items.
---
2. Treasure Map plans drop rate.  We did a test the other night.  Got everyone about 5 of every map.  Loaded up on luck boosting items (daytripper, luck bobbleheads, etc).  From doing ALL the treasure maps, the highest luck player had 77 plans, mid luck had 67, and me being low luck had 58.  We did NOT test what the quality or rarity of the plans was (aka who got more good rare plans.........and who got more bad trash plans).
---
Good to hear that it doesn't effect legendary item drop rates or number of stars.  I can deal with lower durability.  But if my 5 luck character was permanently getting gimped into getting trash drops, that would've upset me quite a bit......lol
---
Huh? Everyone in the queen fight event is marked as team mate (name goes yellow and you can¬¥t pvp them). You can¬¥t initiate pvp while that thing is still alive.
---
That‚Äôs... crazy. I don‚Äôt know. I also have a crafting glitch where I will access the station, my character starts the animation, but the menu doesn‚Äôt come up. I walk away and the menu will come up like 2-3 minutes later.
---
&gt; I saw your post and was going to link it, but I exceeded the 40,000 character cap 
---
No problem. It's a fun side-project, mainly for me to see my chances with a TSE.
---
&gt; was that sarcasm? 
---
More like half-jokingly. Youtube videos about legendary farming locations are far less than ideal for assessing chances. By their nature, the author won't show instances when they failed to get a legendary enemy spawn or got a wood armor. So the videos are inherently biased towards good drops. The closest thing to a more balanced measure was in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bthRBSnZscI) where there were unrecorded sections, that to my understanding, gave out wose loot.
---
Anyway, thanks for the roundup of the problems!
---
Sometimes it happens a glitch where there‚Äôs no rad damage and the things seem to be have irradiated, it also happens the other way around.
---
Nuke present and no ‚Äúnuked flora‚Äù
---
Or you could just pull all the gun powder off super mutants.  Caps + gunpowder + not wasting time with making gunpowder = profit and more fun
---
god i hated it too, put a test bag down, then make each core one at a time placing them in the bag. it‚Äôs super tedious but it works. thanks bethesda 
---
Seriously, that‚Äôs your argument? There‚Äôs a point-based system with consequences and that‚Äôs a ‚Äúbad design‚Äù covered by the expenditure of points. 
---
The First Rule of Tautology Club is the First Rule of Tautology Club.

Here's scorch beast!
---
Nice, I‚Äôll have to check it out.
---
There is a fourth that is in a small unmarked camp west of Top of the World as well.
---
Well, there have been a lot of methods, first it was artillery, then disconnecting, now server rollbacks.
---
None of them work anymore to my knowledge and people who got absurd amounts of stuff will get banned.
---
What‚Äôs it look like when you try to play? 
---
Excellent!
---
Fallout guy is close enough in my book for a non gamer :D
---
Meh wait till the apocalypse, them fancy dressed miniature human's could be the first wave of Raiders!
---
Why pull physical copies?  
---
We're 4 patches in, for starters.
---
@bethesdasupport seems to reply pretty quickly on Twitter. The visibility might help.
---
I like this idea way more than the ability to scrap ammo or sell it to vendors. Seems to strike a better balance.
---
I have the adrenal reaction and the adrenaline perk cards too. 
---
With the nerd rage and radicool I can do major damage in a nuke zone.
---
I just wanted to try diversify like you could in fallout 4. 
---
Only legit faster way is, if you have repaired mainframes, change them for damaged and repair them later in camp for next run. Even if you would be master hacker i dont think so it would make it faster when you spend time hacking.
---
If you find faster route let me know man. I want to be fastest haha.
---
They can literally load up any 80s movie like Mad Max and just make anything they see in that movie, not some shit out of 1950s leave it to beaver land. 
---
It doesnt even have to be faction based items. 
---
I get the strobe glitch too. It's not always in vats. Am also on console. Xbox
---
Next steps: Wait for them to investigate and respond.
---
Seems like you've reached out everywhere that you shouldn't you can maybe try Twitter but I suspect there were just so many people banned that it's going to take them a while to sort through the pile and identify false positives.
---
I haven't played in a long while, I thought this game didn't have NPC's? Who's this Grahm fella?
---
Send a ticket or email to Bethesda.. Pretty sure you can't make and shame in open forums..
---
Fallout: Lord of the Flies
---
I use them for taking out low leveled stuff in the forest. Helps save my .45 and .308 for tougher enemies.
---
Agreed. It just makes it frustrating that many people get swayed from such videos as opposed to deciding for themselves, cause he is far from the only one. :P
---
No! Better yet: A Eyebot and a German Shepherd! The ultimate tag-team :D
---
I actually agree with this approach. If you wanna follow build guides and make a 1-shot death-machine then go ahead. Personally I prefer to just play and let my character develop naturally (or in the way that feels best at the time). Mind you, my character is level 128 now (been playing her since B.E.T.A.) so I've got most of the perks and can just swap them out to support whatever legendary item or build I feel like trying at the time, but I prefer to avoid following the "best build for max damage" stuff. 
---
Yeah, legendary enemies should drop legendary items equivalent to their star level.  If you have to make them tankier and hit harder.........so be it.  I hate, hate, hate seeing a 3 star and getting a 1 star wood leg.  Why?  Why?
---
Also those drops should go back to scaling to YOUR level.  Uranium fever now has the crappiest drops of any event I regularly grind.  Everything is level 40 and below.  Frequently level 25.  ALL of that is worthless on my level 150+ character.  Please REVERT the nerf...........go back to giving items scaled to YOUR level.
---
not sure how others feel about this, but i think it's fucked up to take another player's bag in any kind of event or occurrence that people are working together on. I get it if you're wandering around and come up on a bag, but if im there fighting side by side with you, and i see you die, i think it would be fucked up of me to take your shit.
---
I do. It's still not enough when queen runs take about 1-1.2k ammo and you do them back to back.
---
Mabey it's time to drop the heavy weapon fun and just stick with the shotty
---
Two nights ago, some dude in a weird outfit that included a mask that looked like it was from Saw, came up to my camp and started talking to us in this crazy ass voice. It was really creepy.
---
Then, he started telling me and my friend to kill him. Over and over and over. We were basically ignoring him as I had no desire to engage, was pretty drunk, and was almost done for the night. He just kept asking. My friend fast traveled to his camp because he was annoyed with the guy because he wouldn't shut up, and we had no way to ignore him there, and as soon as he left, the creepy dude says, "fuck it then", and proceeds the decimate my whole camp in literally three seconds. Just wiped it away with massive explosions. It's not a big deal in the realm of resources to rebuild, and I was actually going to move my camp the next day. So I start to leave and this guy is following me. I encounter bloodbugs just a little ways from my now destroyed camp. Saw dude, says, "I hope these blood bugs kill you." Which they did. But right before I died, two more creepy dudes come running up looking exactly like first creepy dude. 
---
Fucking griefers.
---
I went so far as to sell my bunker buster because it weighed 40 lbs. Kept the Daisycutter though.
---
I saw some griefers a couple nights ago traveling in a group of 3, just destroying camp after camp with exploding shotguns, racking up 4 digit bounties, then killing each other to clear the bounties. They'd watch the map to find players who aren't at landmarks and aren't moving, meaning they're at their camp.
---
I'm going to have to block people preemptively whenever I see a large bounty just to protect my camp. The game shouldn't incentivize blocking people for playing the game as it's designed. It's just a bad design. Camps should be safe, or repairs to non-offensive structures should be cheap (repairing a decon shower that took 2 seconds to destroy shouldn't take hours of flux farming).
---
Yea save the names. Send to Bethesda. Take them off of here before you get in trouble.
---
In a suped up Dodge Charger or whatever the Fallout equivalent is I hope.
---
What is Tse ammo?? 
---
uh yeah, the OP states they dont use PA much, so I was focussed on that.
---
again, I would say this is situational.  Make a T60 set for combat and an excavator set for farming runs, EZPZ
---
Me too! 
---
It's horrible. When fast trading multiple items with team mates, that automatic stopping at 0 was invaluable. Select item, trigger a few times to 0, and move along to the next item. Having it roll back around to max value is purposeless and frustrating. 
---
So the big difference between boiled and purified is
---
Purified is in a lot of healing recipes, try not to use purified water rather keep using boiled water to replenish your thirst.
---
Have to get the mods to make it better 
---
Don't we all
---
I just wish they would have done something like in the Mafia games where you can find records all over the wasteland and then donate them to the radio stations to get more variety in music.
---
I would also like it if The Ballad of the Green Beret was one of the songs... there was a Fox Comedy that only lasted one season about the apocalypse once... it was the only record they had.  A bit obscure, but I'd enjoy it.
---
Actually I would have gotten the Cloche hat if it had come in another color other than rose.  I think we could have used it in coal or slate, perhaps a black and green that might match the Garb of Mysteries?
---
I'd advise to restart
---
Surprisingly well! I missed the beat once or twice but I am pretty decent at improving beats to catch up so it was all good! Thanks for asking 
---
Mine is -12 with Class Freak 3
---
Bethesda's philosophy of "why think logically, we have mod creators that do it for us!" Is the only reason I can thing of.
---
This is awesome!
---
the worst kinds are the ones that accidentally get you killed then steal your stuff. even if i‚Äôm going to let a lower level get a few hits in, don‚Äôt steal my stuff if i die. 
---
they complain about higher levels but those lil buggers i tell you, they can be the worst too. 
---
Awesome, thanks for sharing!
---
Map doesn't always get the owned workshop data correct. My only wanted came from picking a toolbox in what I thought (and what my map said) was an unclaimed workshop.
---
Maybe start a new character with a new build. I find a lot of the Fallout magic is lost once you've established yourself and just grind. Go back to when taking on enemies took strategy and patience, not just from being low level, but also learning how to utilize a different build to solve the same problems.
---
It may not be the case here because this sounds like invisible mobs but your health and buffs load and calculate separately. So, if you log off low health it's possible to log back in dead because your buffs from gear load second and you end up negative hp. I haven't tested this myself but I have seen it mentioned a few places. I top of before log out just in case.
---
So craft and scrap a bunch? Or do most people find them at vendors?
---
Something I learned, if they are not in PA and have a high bounty they are rocking a full set of assassin/sentinel and are just farming anyone who comes after them. It's sucks it feels cheaty as fuck, now when I go after bounties if there in a suit I nope out.
---
Wrong, we need Rex
---
How about being able to scrap legendary items for a unique type of flux that allows you to turn maxed out perk cards into perma-perks that are passively active without having to be equipped? Make them like a mutation with no drawbacks (with a high rare-mat cost). 
---
I honestly think that 90% of the people on the game don't have one or just don't use it. It sucks, I have mine on Area and so far I have been on 1 team, excluding my regular people that I play with, that used mics, and ran into 3 other players (1 was a dick only wanted to fight) that I talked to over the mics since the BETA.
---
I got the book for Xmas. I like it, never had a strategy guide before. I got it because it has maps of the insides of buildings and shows you spawn points of all the mags n bobble heads and tells you how many cap stashes are in an area. It's not perfect but I've used it a lot to find cool secondary locations to place my camp at. 
---
Nah mate, you need to slot in a Krackens Eye of Agility for that +40 Agility bonus
---
Everyone is put on the same team in an event area. Not possible. When the event ends shit might get wild though.
---
I disagree
---
Actual luck or the special skill allocation?
---
Okay, fine. So you're affected by it in the sense that your friend doesn't want to play with you. Which doesn't surprise me. I wouldn't want to either if you were condescendingly quoting dictionary definitions at me all the time. At this point it might not be Fallout 76 OR YouTubers that's the problem in this hypothetical friendship of yours.
---
And no, YouTube videos don't have an effect on *me* regardless of how I react to it because my friends aren't idiots who let their opinions be swayed by people who film themselves in front of a greenscreen in their bedroom.
---
I love this! Extra points for fallout poses!!!
---
I think they should copy diablo 3 loot system.  It would fit the mechanics perfectly and it turned diablo around from the same state of this game.
---
I use nuka's instead of stims when possible as well, popping a quantum with the perk equipped is much better than a stim imo and you can get Nuka's all over the place. 
---
If he was just using them and other foods etc he's not unkillable its just a rock paper scissors situation with whoever runs out of consumables first.
---
Him sending a vid of him using cola's doesn't mean he wasn't doing anything else on top of that though so could still have been abusing a glitch. Can you see his status screen from pip boy in the video? would be interesting to see whats on there etc.
---
Craft lvl 15 and scrap them to get mods
---
Death was during the loot stage.  No idea what my idiot friend did to trigger it.
---
Can we classify fast traveling into camps, and ending up inside a foundation or wall, and being immovable as a glitch as well? 
---
Weve found work around by placing cooking stoves or interactable items near by so that the animation pulls you out of the wall but it's still frustrating. 
---
Also forgive me for skimming but the pip boy glitch since last patch is my biggest complaint. 
---
If you load in and access your pip boy even a second too soon it will lock the screen. It shows up black, you cant back out and the only way out of it is to reboot the entire game. 
---
Wow it looks so shit and dull in real life. 
---
 Check on the Xbox looking for groups thing and click on fallout 76. Got all of mine for 100 caps
---
i love this. how long did this take you? usually when i work on digital art (3d, painting, etc) shit takes me weeks 
---
Thanks, Good to know, and some people are lucky as hell in game..  
---
But it would not make for good ClickBait if they showed Wood armor and 1\* Legendary Nocturnal pipebolts
---
If you're truly innocent, probably best course of action would be trying to reach out to them and wait 
---
The perk idea is a really good one to prevent everyone from having one. As a solution to loads of healthy dogs, perhaps you could tame wild mongrels, wolves or maybe even some small and nasty like a tick or radtoad.
---
Sign me up for the radtoad pet!
---
Dolly Sods (In the Mire) has the tattered mole outfit (sometimes). There are two buildings, it's not the main one. It's the one closest to watch tower. On the second floor, behind a level 2 locked door. You should see it on a shelf, can't miss it if it's there. May need to server hop. 
---
There's definitely a chainsaw. Got mine at Ranger District Office, shed in the back with the cages. 
---
One time my friend found a three star legendary ghram walking around and I freaked out and went over there to see what he had.... Same old inventory..... I was catfished.....
---
Hiking simulation Mode: ON
---
whose cap pool does he use?
---
Thats what i was calling out 
---
And I agree but they should be more careful and observe better with the account ban streak 
---
Trying to dual melee / ranged is going to give you some sub-optimal builds.
---
Pick one, and find a min / max loadout for it online.
---
You might be missing important perks like Tank Killer for ranged or Incisor for melee.
---
I purposely built 2 completely different characters, one min/max ranged, one min/max melee.
---
There is the Raiders quest line with Rose
---
the BoS quest line 
---
I been playing since beta and still only level 25. filthy casual...
---
I got a two-shot combat rifle recently, just in time for it to be nerfed. Yay.
---
Well that would explain what happened the last time. I had no issue the first two but the last time I was there, this would explain it perfectly.
---
CBBE?
---
I‚Äôve been waiting and I did reach out. Lol 
---
It... Its...beautiful
---
I wish they would fix VATS to not target other players in nuke zones......or at least prioritize enemies over other players.
---
I'm in pacifist mode why does my VATS always target other players when I'm being swarmed by mobs?
---
It does
---
Outdid them? Yeah right lol. When that game came out it was not well received. 
---
Exactly. But PvP kills are fine imo
---
Just a warning, it is god awful. Only good for running around and messing with people. But I'm also not specc'd in melee but that may not make much of a difference.
---
First wave is always a little rough but they really should have been better prepared to quickly assess false positives. Would be nice to see them give some sort of update or ETA for those affected too.
---
Well how does every player have perfect enclave power armor and magic Homemade Ak replicas.
---
They should sell NCR Ranger armour that would be popular.
---
Whoever gets more kills in wave defense, etc.
---
Compared to now? NV can easily be considered the best of the FO FPS/TPS franchise.
---
They must have had some reasoning behind almost only providing pre-war items. The atomic store is like a home improvement and Halloween attire store from before the fallout.
---
I thought they fixed it... they didn't?  J just assumed with then pa patch notes then then the nukes slowed down
---
Better looking player models I can‚Äôt remember what cbbe stand for but that‚Äôs what it does
---
I honestly don't think I'd like being able to just craft legendary effects onto an item. It sounds like something that would be much easier to exploit than the current "grind Whitesprings/SBQ for the perfect TSE". You'd just have to grind out enough "useless 1-star" legendary items to gather enough mats to craft a TSE (because you know that's all anyone would make + bloodied and maybe berserker). 
---
Someone else mentioned a different approach that I'd personally prefer. Have legendary effects drop as mods in addition to legendary armors/weapons. Each mod would take up x out of the 5 legendary diamond slots which would make the 1/2-star legendary items a bit more viable as you'd have room to mod in more effects (if/when you find the right ones to use). 
---
It just feels like players are focusing too much on grinding for perfect gear and don't bother to actually just enjoy what you find and see how best to use what drops naturally and not through repetitive grind-fests. 
---
False.  
---
Seems kinda a jerk move to ignore all you wrote and leave a short kinda rude reply but the reasons really should be obvious.
---
stop, let him, I want him to fuck my wife
---
Thank you! Took the words right out of my mouth 
---
Not exactly what you're looking for, but the *More Where That Came From* mod on nexusmods adds about 40 new songs and I think a robot DJ.
---
I haven't tried it yet, but I did use the mod in FO4 and it was essential.
---
You're a monster. But I can't say I was never tempted to do something similar with his constant whining. I had to install a mod specifically to remove the whining sound files.
---
I miss dog meat 
---
I Wanted to try this sooo bad. I was solo at the Ammunition factory and he wandered into the build zone. I couldn't talk to him to stall him and build at the same time and he got away from me.
---
The sims 76. This game is something every virgin want. And adult men whose dream is pink casle bed. I love it. There will be different walls as there are different floors i belive.
---
You can skip repairing the pipes in the reactor core. The door that opens after it's repaired can be lockpicked instead (Lvl 3 lock). Then in the next room you hack the terminal (Lvl 3) to bypass reactor security and open that second door.  
---
Destroying the cores can be done quickly by using grenades (landing one each in front of each bank of cores will destroy whole groups at a time).  
---
Replacing the cores can be done more efficiently by having a full repaired set already with you.  
---
Don't know of any ways to completely skip all of those without glitching, however.  
---
Why would anyone do this when purified water is readily available at your camp while boiled water requires getting dirty water then boiling it? 
---
I‚Äôm brand new to the game and have never played any of the Fallout games before. I‚Äôm really enjoying the game but feel totally lost at what to do to move forward.
---
I‚Äôm level 9... I‚Äôd also appreciate any tips you‚Äôd be willing to offer.
---
There are wild dogs though which is realistic imo. It could be worked into taming 
---
Another one is upstairs in one of the buildings in Harper's Ferry.  Looks like he blew his own brains out.
---
Too much fat......
---
You are someone else's content.
---
There is no "best" of the Fallout franchise. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. 
---
Just because I'm dating your mom and I'm comfortable with her giving you your special night night hand jobs doesn't make me a cuck. She's doing it for you. Be more respectful and thankful, she's a wonderful woman.
---
I think that can be part of the main quest line. May be mistaken though.
---
Deadly beauty
---
i love you
---
Brilliant! Bravo!

---
Same here, made a mule to relieve some of the weight stress. Heh. I'm getting close to only needing those very rare regional outfits you can get from events/dailies. I'm sure I'll be griping about those soon enough. 
---
I'm on PC. Occasionally post on the trading channels, looking to buy them, but no luck so far. 
---
Yes, I am sure. I tried it in borderless and in full screen. I reverted to the default suggested by GeForce Experience, which was higher settings all 'round. Still has a solid 60 FPS for a half a minute and then it stutters. Then back to solid 60, then it will just drop to the 30s for a second. My CPU temps are fine. I am well below 100% utilization on all cores. 
---
I've just accepted that I will never not wear excavator armor. I'm not going to waste a million hour managing my inventory when I'd rather just play the game. It sucks, but I guess it is what it is at the current time
---
To be fair, a huge portion of the 1 star reviews on metacritic were from salty bitches who couldn't get it on Steam so they just review bombed it as "payback" without even playing it.
---
Basically nude mods
---
Yep it's broken.  Has been fed back to Bethesda by folks on here.
---
I dont know, i am not using it, but ppl i play with werent bitching, so i think it still works. Not sure tho
---
I was forced to purchase I'm married.

The weekly challenge to pick flowers isn't working. Although I have dozens of five types of the flowers listed, the progress on every flower remains at 0/10. I have done what was needed to finish this challenge, but it didn't complete or award atoms. I read here on reddit that this is not a PS4 only issue, as some players on all three systems are suffering this issue: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aio1u9/weekly\_challenge\_flower\_picking\_not\_registering/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aio1u9/weekly_challenge_flower_picking_not_registering/)
---
Wow! It looks so real! Amazing attention to detail. This is great! Thanks for sharing üòÉ
---
Someone in a comment thread recently said as soon as you touch their bag, it no longer shows up on the map as a quest marker.
---
Any truth to that?
---
I've been playing Bethesda games since Morrowind, and even though 76 has some issues, I would put up with quite a lot before I'd turn my back on them!  It's a little clunky, but I have faith they'll fix it and continue to update it.  Being able to play with friends is pretty damn awesome!
---
Did you sing for the staff? A little "Crawl-Out Thru the Fallout, Baby"?
---
Want the super cool drill i got from the SBQ last week?
---
He's one of if not the only organic character in the game, that won't try to kill you. And that is what does it for me... He loves his Brahmin too... Really loves his Moo-Moo
---
are you on PC? i think i might have an extra set,
---
Do you have the Warehouse Building plans?
---
That entrance in the video with the high voltage sign is point on. Very impressed with it all. Thanks for posting.

I‚Äôll be online in a bit you‚Äôre welcome to join

Like that with a space in the middle üëçüèΩ
---
I have a Mic on my xb1, ps4 and pc. I refuse to talk to overly chatty, arrogant, entitled,  selfish kids. 
---
Of which are all online in any game. Fallout 76 is no different. I always try to be nice but having my bag stolen after dieing and being followed around and pestered gets a bit old.
---
Never even get so much as thanks. Also why are they all telling me their life story's, I literally do not care...
---
Oh yeah. We are doing a check-in on Friday and leaving Monday. She‚Äôs an equestrian so the only prerequisite is that I have to do the horseback ride with her üòÇ.
---
No idea. I‚Äôll give that a go and test it tonight after work. I figure most folks know roughly where they died. I don‚Äôt linger around because I don‚Äôt want them to feel intimidated or bullied.
---
Somewhere in the bunker, the haunting sound of "Johnny Guitar" drifts through the concrete halls.
---
I can see this dad being the Main character in Fallout 4. 
---
Well I think we all know who wears the 3 patch suit in your family 
---
Unfortunately no. I'm on Xbox. Thank you though. 
---
I think almost anything would be better than the current system of grinding and praying. There isn't anything new for me to explore/do in the game but I was still having fun grinding for legendaries. But after days of getting nothing useful, I'm just gonna move on to a different game until more content drops. I love this game, but it just feels like a waste of my time to grind for minuscule chances of getting anything decent.
---
I agree with this sentiment 176%. 
---
Feels like any/all multiplayer loot games end up becoming grind-fests for players who want to achieve "the perfect build". Doesn't sound fun at all to me. Okay, you can 1-shot everything in the game now - enjoy never having a tough battle through a building full of greenskins of a close call as you try to sneak by a too-powerful Scorchbeast. 
---
I remember one of my favorite moments was during the B.E.T.A. when I saw a supply drop flare go up right by the vault. I had maybe 14 rounds of ammo for my shitty pipe pistol and no armor to speak of. Saw a group of level 5 Protectrons guarding the drop and thought "I'm only level 3, but maybe I can handle this..."
---
Nope. They blasted the shit out of me and I wound up having to lead them on a chase away from the drop only to circle around and grab what I could before dashing off. I loved that experience much more than just strolling through Watoga and nonchalantly blasting every bot as it spawned with my Troubleshooter's Explosive Pump-Action. 
---
Amazing - we didn't stay in the hotel, only visited for the tour, but it looks really amazing. What a great gift!
---
I have to agree with you 100%. I‚Äôve been playing since the beta.
---
Why?
---
The gateway to turning FO76 into a hentai.  
---
How well does this mod work?
---
I considered installing it, but I saw that it's a 'global' chat, rather than per-server. Seems like too much chatter for my tastes.
---
No it's not? New games come out that need the bigger displays? The game released well before Christmas and it's nearly February? Obviously quantity downsizes post launch/post holiday.
---
Go play Minecraft
---
only the ones with straws.... don't tell california 
---
Most systems in Appalachia were automated by 2077, so much so that the government was having a vote for full automation.
---
This is the most likely reason. 
---
yep, its about 45 degrees off for me, until I get close to the destination, then it jumps around quickly to the correct spot
---
I don't have a purifier
---
I haven't had that happen yet.  Sucks that you did man :(
---
I did however meet an interesting guy who might or might not have been streaming.
---
I was in some high level area (I think wes tek or something) with a CRAP ton of super mutants inside.  So many level 50-68s that I was having trouble as a 100+ melee character.  Like run, hide, heal, fight, run hide, heal trouble....lol
---
Out of nowhere someone joins inside and yells "I'm coming to save you BOY".  I thought "ah crap, here we go, some griefer is on the way".  NOPE, it was a level 8 character dressed and talking like KFC Colonel Sanders yelling things like "I got  a hit in, smack em good, we'll get these muties BOY".  He was getting nonstop DESTROYED by everything that wasn't aggro'd to me.  I kept trying to save him, but it was futile, too many mutants....lol  He died repeatedly and would come back in and say "a temporary setback, we'll get those muties BOY".
---
Sad to say I wasn't feeling it at the time, so I didn't say much to him.  I was on a quest to get "something" done.  He followed me around and got rekt for about 30 mins.  Then the nuke dropped at prime.
---
He had a hazmat suit.  He went with me to the queen.  Shouting encouragement the whole way.  Getting absolutely REKT any time ANYTHING aggro'd to him.  He went down so many times I couldn't afford stimpacks to revive him.  Other players were running around trying to revive him.  Eventually everyone ran low on stimpacks and stopped reviving him.  He never let up though, kept charging into the fight yelling "get that mutie queen, smack her good".
---
Whoever you were, I'll never forget you Colonel Sanders :)
---
Not everyone you meet in-game is going to be a douche, some are actually pretty cool.....lol
---
I think I might I have a ton of plans I‚Äôll give them as they are doubles of what I have 
---
It is truly amazing how relatively little it took to keep the bunker a secret for so long. The people constructing it were just told it was part of the new wing of the hotel (literally and figuratively a cover for the bunker) and to not ask questions. The simple signs on the exterior doors were all it took to dissuade people from investigating or questioning.
---
Why do you need to make a throwaway account to post this?  Whats your shady angle?
---
Tse ammo?
---
You mean regular ammo?
---
Or the ultracite versions of it ?
---
PS4 user and I agree. I've had little to no problems with freezing and crashing since the game came out. Since the last patch I have had 3-6 blue screens and 2-4 times the game froze on me.
---
I'm going to rebuild my PS database and clean up some space to see if that helps.
---
The only reasoning I can come up with is that the Lore stuff was meant to be rolled out as FREE DLC while the Atom Shop was designed mainly to please the Fortnight PvP crowd that consistently pours hundreds of dollars into silly loud costumes and such.
---
That‚Äôs my hope anyhow 
---
That's actually a great idea. I never bother looting bags of my bounty kills, unless it's a guy in Whitesprings with a TSE stealing all the ghouls and I do that just out of spite (bounty not mandatory for him), haha. 
---
I'll have to do that for others, though. 
---
Off topic: from my experience, there is a higher probability for Excavator Calibrated Shocks to show up with Responder vendors (specifically the vendors in the Ash Heap &amp; Camden). 
---
It only goes down...  is that broke?
---
Looks great! I like how much more worn and cracked the leather arm-band looks. 
---
Agreed. If they add it, especially to the store, it's gonna be cosmetic only. I really don't see them adding perk cards and rebalancing the game for dogs that can attack without DLC with all the problems, issues, and requests already on the list.
---
Do Reddit threads move to fast for people or what?? Man its like watching the same question pop up over and over and over..
---
This was actually one of my favorite mods from Fallout 4. 
---
If you over repair the chainsaw, drill, ripper, and buzz blades they do considerably more damage. 
---
Ooh, I haven't done Monster Mash yet. Thanks!
---
I get where you are coming from. But I got to a point where I had done everything in the game, the last thing I wanted to do was get the perfect armor set and weapons. After hours and hours of grinding legendary mobs I got nothing remotely decent. I can't bring myself to log in and do it again, it feels futile and like a total waste of time.
---
Ok then it would be preferred to join him give him the stuff and we can work out a reward after 
---
The first time you made this thread the mods removed the post. And yet you think it's wise to make it again?
---
Not who you‚Äôre replying to, but how much was it? Maybe I can talk my husband into going. It‚Äôd involve a flight, though.
---
Damn, that's a pity. I'm on xbox and would've offered to help look or just trade with you.
---
I have no idea where I'm at as far as how complete my wardrobe is atm but it's pretty much the only thing keeping me playing atm. I'm lvl 97 and kinda bored of it all, but tell myself it's worth it to keep playing in hopes of finding a rare piece of clothing I've not gotten yet. Lol. 
---
so he can turn around and sell it on his main....MERICA!!!!
---
LOL, this is a great album!  Did you have a sudden urge to blow up all the cars?
---
That sucks, I'm all alone if the game wentry free I would have probably enjoy it for longer than an hour before getting sick and bored for like two days.
---
works here and i'm loving the princess bed
---
We need red hats with that slogan on them.
---
Is like to know the miracle additive we put into our juices and stews that takes the radiation out.. Boiled water is radioactive.. Then you cook with it and no more radiation..
---
Well that looks infinitely better than anything BGS has made. You shoube really proud! 
---
People play games for different reasons, you don't get to dictate what is fun for someone.
---
These are all obvious things, so sorry about that, but have you tried turning vsync on/off? I've got a 970 and have zero issues 90% of the time. Everything set to high, except textures (medium), a pretty minimal custom .ini, etc.
---
I honestly only care about the Warehouse Plans lol. I'm in desperate search of them. Are you on now? I'll still drop him a few RadAways and a Disease Cure still. I don't mind. 
---
*should be
---
PvP is so unpopular that inviting others to participate doesn't work.
---
The only way to get anyone to PvP with you is to piss them off by one shot killing them in pacifist mode or by wrecking their base. They piss the player off who then tries to get revenge while completely unaware that the aggressive player has been trading and buying OP duped weapons and armor for several weeks.....which ends in more frustration for the innocent player.
---
It's well known that PvP games tend to attract the most tixic type of gamers. BGS should never have tried to mix a lore based RPG with the Fortnite garbage.
---
"fisher prime"
---
Wholeheartedly with you on this.....I'm a diehard Fallout fan. Playing with others is brilliant, playing against....no. I'd like it to have been more like Borderlands. Fully co-op, no PvP. If there is to be a PvP, it should have a different server for those who don't have pacifist mode on. Grieving was always going to be a problem, and was highlighted very early, even before it came out!
---
I mean the atom shop team is separate from the dev/bug fixing people, so they should be entirely independent of each other 
---
&gt; I did not get the sense that they get a lot of video-game related tourism, based on how fancy all of the children I saw around the hotel were dressed. 
---
My mom and stepfather stayed their once, back in the 1980s, and it certainly had the reputation not only of cultivated southern gentility, but an *Old Money* clientele. My stepfather was from rural Alabama, and his kin were all *mightily* impressed by the postcards he sent them.
---
I couldn't make it past the palm scanners, I'm pretty sure. (But my 'toon can, some of them at least!)
---
Yes they do not have a dramatic effect on your well-being or life.  However, the person is not wrong to be upset of the mass negative YouTube reviews either because regardless of what you do, it will affect the state of the game, people playing and other factors.  Hellgate London for example the servers closed down very quickly after launch, despite me still wanting to play the game. I was affected in a big way, no matter my mental fortitude.  This is the overall point I'm making.  So I understand why the reviews bother them, even though you should shake off and ignore things, sometimes it's too big to ignore these effects.
---
Scrap it entirely. It's shit.
---
Could be legit, but I have hard time believing someone selling TSE shotguns (looks like to multiple people) 2 days before getting banned. 
---
I know this is an old post but I've encountered this issue twice and wanted to share my fix. 
---
When trying to craft an Excavator arm I found myself short on oil. I went and gathered some oil but when I got back to the Power armor station the Level 45 arm was grayed out, despite having more than the requirements needed. 
---
I fixed this by bulking the oil I had on hand at a tinkerer's station and then returning to the power armor station. I assume by bulking it I refreshed my inventory for that item and it then reflected properly on the crating station.
---
Same bug happened to me few weeks ago, i fixed by accessing the game from the directory and im currently without even opening the launcher.
---
I think it‚Äôs more likely that they are making money by introducing objects similar to those which are being bought. It‚Äôs a much more reasonable explanation that there are people outside of reddit who like the Sims aspect of the game than that a sophisticated company like that just doesn‚Äôt pay attention to what sells.
---
I can't call you anything but Jar Jar.
---
Made this suggestion on this sub before, only took about 15 minutes for me to get ass blasted. People saying ‚Äúthere are other players we don‚Äôt need companions‚Äù ‚Äúthis is a useless idea since its multiplayer‚Äù 
---
Appalachia was in the middle of a huge battle regarding fully automating the workforce and other aspects of everyday life when the bombs dropped. I imagine most everything that could be, was redesigned to run through automation - including the radio station. 
---
The tour was $39 (worth EVERY penny and 90 minutes total). The closest airports are VERY small, I flew into Shenandoah Valley Airport and my friends picked me up and drove the rest of the 2ish hours by car and stayed in an VRBO nearby. Not sure how much the hotel itself is but I would venture a guess it's a pretty penny (but maybe less in the off-season).
---
Mine is -12 with Class Freak 3 as well.
---
Get class freak bro :)
---
I agree.
---
Curses. I‚Äôm obviously not business minded. After hanging out with him for 20 minutes with him talking uninterrupted it did wear on me...plus the moos....the horror.
---
No. Dude, we're in West Virginia. There's literally no reason for NCR stuff to be here. We should get cool stuff but we need to at least keep the lore intact. 
---
did they ever specify if you had to create a new character for a PVP base server or if it was just going to allow you to select between PVP and PVE?
---
Funny, I down the level 50 ones in 5-10 shots depending on luck with Crits and sneak attacks. But I‚Äôm a min-Max‚Äôd stealth rifle-vats crit build, and I have the appropriate mutations, partial Unyielding armor,  and a 1* armor piercing lever action. Level 80 ones take a bit more work, maybe 20 shots since I don‚Äôt get as many sneak bonus attacks. 
---
In terms of VATS, VATS only works to a certain distance, and it‚Äôs deceptive with SB because they are so big. Often they‚Äôre just out of range. 
---
I have mixed feeling about it. I'm glad a lot of the BOS and Enclave stuff that is in game is actually in game rather than microtransactions. How would you feel if all the cool faction stuff was locked behind the Atmoic Shop rather than in-game? Altho I do think that means we need more faction stuff in game.
---
It works really well. You can silence any of the rooms including global. There are rooms for Global, for Server only chat, for trade, and you can create a chat Clan and invite people to it.
---
The commands are all really easy and basic chat stuff like /G for global. If you see too much chatter you just type /global to turn it off. Type it again to turn it on.
---
You use the ~ key to enter chat, and there's a config file that lets you adjust the position and colors of the overlay.
---
The only issue I've encountered was having the chat window open and then hitting ctrl tab for social. I wasn't able to leave the social menu or chat when I did that. Annoying, but I know not to do it again. 
---
In addition, they need to completely disable the pathfinding "parts will be unaccessible" code.  Floors should snap without stairs!
---
I was walking around with a 10c bounty for a couple days because I accidentally fired on somebody's workshop while helping to defend it. I log in the other day and somebody invites me to their team, which I accept, then they emote "come here." I had a feeling what was coming, so I stashed all my junk and I traveled to their camp. *They immediately open fire on me with their friend and turrets.* Needless to say, I was made dead quick. But I actually appreciate that since I was getting sick of being wanted over something silly. Thank you, murdery stranger, whoever you are.
---
Nice suggestions but some will just make the game to boring and easy, bec lets be honest we wouldn't want to kill 1000s of leg mobs if w e can just make it. i could understand if there we're 1000s of mods but at this point its just two shot and not much more will be crafted. 
---
Getting 1-shotted and losing 150 caps isn't anything other than getting to play as a loot pinata for another player. 
---
Byyyyyyeeeeeee
---
So you think it‚Äôs a good thing that there are several types of weapons too heavy to actually use on a day to day basis and too heavy to leave in the stash?
---
That‚Äôs just like, your opinion man. I love my pink princess bed and weird pointy light. About time we got something cute and pink. 
---
NV was the only one that wasclose to being this broken. Never had enemies holding weapons backwards or not moving at all disappearing in front of me have had in fallout 4 whole buildings not loading but not the older games I've have over a 1000hrs in every Bethesda made game since oblivion and never had this amount of problems yeah their other games was buggy but this one is far worse an tons of other ppl say the same and way more empty.
---
So PvE players aren't allowed to farm ammo or fusion cores?
---
How about PvP players not be allowed to join in nuke zones?.......does that sound fair to you?
---
Sexy local workbenches in your area looking for some fun! Click here.
---
Only shredding minigun is good. But it LITERALLY breaks after 3-4 enemies.
---
I'm not getting rekt, I'm getting annoyed to death by something with shit rewards.  Also starting to worry the stupid visual spam may cause issues with my video card (on a budget, upgrading is NOT in my immediate future).
---
I'm really disappointed in the lack of power armor paints so far. I missed the Blackbird paint, and so far that's the only one I've liked. I don't care to represent Vault Tec or the USA, camo isn't my style, and I don't want to look like a toy box or a racecar. Just something toned down and not gimmicky. I'd strongly consider spending $5-10 on more atoms if I happen to be low when a paint job I like comes out. And moreso if the paint applied to Excavator too.
---
No....is the short answer. Mob mentality. Your always going to get some dick playing the game. I've often played with people who have a bounty and because I've pacifist mode on, I play on and do no damage.
---
It was definitely VERY different from the surrounding area and locals we met other places. I would guess that reputation is still in full swing (no golf pun intended).
---
Yeah sure I‚Äôm on now he is near the gramm estate savage divide border 
---
I like how you did the emoji lol. That's cool tho I wanna check it out. I wonder how far it is from me
---
I think the comparison to FO4 regular play vs FO76 needs to stop. If you want to compare FO4 survival and FO76 that comparison is probably closer aligned. As I level I think the idea is to keep players with 1-2 main weapons and not 5 or 6 different types. I also think managing your player and CAMP is part of the game. I don't think it should be 60% of the total amount of your play time but I know as I level the better I get at managing my junk/stash. One issue i have is weapon breaking because there is no on screen monitor to tell me unless i tab in to look or when it breaks on me during a battle. I think Bethesda should have provided MODS or PLANS as you level or every 5 levels as a perk of leveling. Being close to 50 now I like the fact I can go anywhere and deal mostly with anything. Fights may be longer but its manageable. 
---
this is great information. As you said, repairing the pipes i feel is going to be a lot faster than lockpicking a lvl 3 door with a bunch of enemies on your ass
---
yeah, i got that too...thumbs down in  a nuke zone when i put a 10 cap price on stims.  Im in the middle of a nuke zone...ill revive you, but he wanted half my stims...i think thats a fair price given the situation.
---
Well I would suspect you too because your first post ever on your account was trying to sell a two shot explosive combat shotgun. Which is the best gun on the game. 
---
Might I chime in here as i finally did one of these events yesterday, but if there is a Breach and Clear event, I highly recommend doing it. Got a lot of every type of ore from that one. Just make sure you have your Hornwright acces card on you to open all the boxes. 
---
Did you find a bunch of Charred Feral Ghouls in one of the side buildings?
---
This, *this* is the heart of my complaint!
---
Use the damn radio.
---
If you aren‚Äôt aware of the pvp radio, you haven‚Äôt even remotely been paying enough attention.
---
They need to add a better cover system
---
I'm always up to trade, and more often than not I've got what you need. Assuming you need the random junk that I've got!
---
For real though, you can always hit me up (Sleepyface/PC) for junk, chems, outfits, and more!
---
I've had dreams of just chilling with him for hours.
---
I normally don't listen to the in game radio, but whenever I hear The Ink Spots playing nearby I immediately tune in for that FO3 nostalgia. 
---
Do you have a NUMA architecture? Do you have a 1900X? Do you have an AMD X399 chipset? Do you have yours installed on an NVMe RAID? You see, the thing about bugs is you might have them and might might not. Or vice versa. Everything was working fine just a few weeks ago in 4K.  I am currently investigating core affinity, UMA vs NUMA, and other things. 
---
The tips even say that the bobble heads are stackable
---
Umm, for your info I only had 2 shotguns? When there are plenty of others who have 10 to 20 weapons at a time for sale and a bunch of legendary armor.  How does that make me a duper? Please do tell. Lol 
---
You need to min max. Get all the crit/sneak perks. Get concentrated fire.  Use  bobblehead and magazine with curator (they last forever). Mod your gun. Hit a vats sneak crit headshot with all of those buffs running, it should 1 shot the SB.
---
I've seen a video of someone with a non legendary 150 damage gun 1-2 shot a 65 SB.
---
Anti Armor Explosive Handmade with sneak bonuses and such can put you at extremely high damage numbers.
---
I've seen a longer documentary on this. It's fascinating stuff. I lived through the end of the cold war, and remember the toxicity of the situation between Russia and the rest of the world. I wonder how many other secrets are out there that are hidden better!
---
We'll get some damn human NPCS even if we have to *MAKE THEM OURSELVES*
---
with sex.
---
I mean, you didn‚Äôt have to keep seeking revenge... you die once, ok, you didn‚Äôt know. You die ~10 times like you say the. That‚Äôs kind of on you solely. If I see a guy beat the shit out of someone or myself 9 times in a row, I‚Äôm not gonna try a 10th.
---
knock knock knock.... Who is it?  Land Shark!
---
Luckily I have not had this experience post-patch. I hate reading these things because it is very upsetting, not to mention unfair. This game is very fun and still promises much for the future. AAA developers have no excuse for pushing out a game without having it tried and tested before. Hopefully this fix thix issue for you and the many other players in the same situation.
---
EXACTLY!!! I just wish any of my friends played
---
Lol. It's called budgeting. 60 dollars is chump change. Yes, I can obviously swing an occasional purchase every few months when I'm feeling it. Quite a bit more if I wanted to. That's the point I'm making. I'm an adult with no where near the flexible income of some other people and I have 0 qualms or struggles paying the value of the game. I'm not buying a game when I should be paying a bill. I don't have "money issues", I just don't have as much money.
---
You don't know whether Bethesda has treated me badly because you haven't played the game. My playtime/months of experience kind of invalidate whatever you're trying to claim. 
---
I appreciate the offer! Server hopping can get quite tedious, especially when looking for something specific. Just found out about a Flight helmet that has a chance to spawn on a gurney in the Ranger District Office, northeast of Fort Defiance. 
---
I'm lvl 177 myself. Joined a casual "guild" and it keeps it refreshing. I recommend finding some folk to play with, it definitely helps, if you haven't already. Probably be bored to tears if I was by myself the whole time. 
---
 A bitter fool. ;) I'm long retired and am 72 at this point. 
---
 Video games are my hobby and I love em'. This one is great fun, and the idiots playing it are a big part of that. ;)
---
Robots or AI like everything else in the game.
---
What if it's been 5 minutes and you still haven't returned to claim your bag? I saw one of those at the golf club last night, but didn't know who's it was. They should probably label bags with player names. Eventually I stopped waiting for someone to show up.
---
; )
---
I can fly through the lock pick in 30secs or less.  You can even sneak into that room and avoid a lot of the enemies.  Makes it significantly faster.
---
The terminal can hacked quickly by just trying the first 3 words, then backing and and going back in.  Even when swapping cards I find it faster than doing the pipes and a lot less durability loss on items.
---
Why, does it hurt your feelings? It's just a word, grow up.
---
Yeah, doing the emotes was a nice touch. :D
---
Not sure if you can wall him in.  But it's worth a try.
---
Hit up the FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits by "alt tabbing".  You'll have to let go of Ghram for a few seconds to get the first person added to your friends list.  Once they're there.......they can hold Ghram while you build.  Now the Ghram Lemonaide stand is open for business.....lol
---
Cold Case and an Organic solution are two solid quests. 
---
Anyone get a response from Bethesda yet?
---
The worst part: You're not able to craft it at a low level, even though it should make sense with the abundance of wood in the Forest.
---
Slow down there turbo. As I said, "could be legit," but its suspect as fuck.
---
I‚Äôm on almost every night for a couple of hours. If you ever see me (gamertag gettygetz) my camp is always just south of Helvetica right on the water. I have a decon shower, water purifications, some plants, and all the crafting units. Feel free to stop by or drop me a message if you find yourself in need. 
---
Likewise.
---
One word of advice: Do the overseer questline and consider perking into melee plus ONE category of ranged weapon.
---
Probably? I wouldn't know I've only seen the jerk once
---
Only now from the atom store
---
I think the NOTES tab should have a dimmed list below it with plans and recipes we already know, similar to the QUESTS tab shows what we've completed. *This should be a thing why is it not a thing.*
---
Certain affixes could be account locked; or as D3 did, raise the drop rate and lock them all as untradable
---
does demolition expert and explosive perks work for explosive weapons? I thought only for grenades and such..
---
Yes please please please. 
---
I'm guessing because it's incredibly lightweight? 
---
I dunno, just my 2 caps
---
I love how you attack the game for petty and personal reasons while ignoring and dismissing any valid criticisms. Says a lot about you.
---
Ever since they finally fixed the lever action, it's even moreso my favorite weapon. Quick, accurate, and deadly. Plus it looks cool with my hunter's long coat and pirate hat. 
---
Good thing he had that Power Armor to keep him upright as he nodded off. 
---
I farmed ghouls in that alley...
---
I lost my junk in that tennis court...
---
I was attacked by robots near that entrance...
---
A Deathclaw killed me there...
---
You can equip super duper when you craft cores... on average you'll net enough cores for every 3rd nuke to not have to craft.
---
That being said, replacing the cores almost always gives us some lag, and slows us down.  I wish they would change this from 15 to 10 or to even 5 cores, so it wouldnt take so long waiting on the server to respond to us replacing a core.
---
Exactly 
---
Yeah I've dropped a bag once and it either disappeared or went through the floor. Gone.
---
Same here 
---
Cold dead hands, etc ;)  It's my #1 backup weapon for all-purpose use--even against landed scorchbeasts!
---
This is true. New Vegas was an unplayable mess at launch, and was only great by the time the dlc came out.
---
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! so good!
---
I thought that's how it worked, instanced to each player? It seems that every day I am able to sell 200 caps worth of goods to the vendor network. I don't know all about it, but some vendors appear to be part of that network while others have their own daily limit of 200 caps. I'm also not sure when it resets; is there a dedicated reset time for shop cap limits or is it based off when you interact with it?
---
Replenishing more often would be okay, but they kind of need an increase as well. I wouldn't want to head to a vendor, sell 200 caps worth of stuff, wait another 4 hours (or whatever the reset is), and sell another 200 caps worth of stuff. We need a more reasonable cap limit to be able to offload your excess stuff. Then you can go back out into the wastes and be able to collect more and again be able to sell off the excess through a reasonable reset time of 2-4 hours or so. 
---
Again, alternatively or in conjunction with, we need outlets to actually use the excess scrap we gather, or be able to display/store things like aid or decoration junk items. There's a huge missed opportunity with the building aspect of this game to the point is clearly underdeveloped and rushed. If Bethesda were serious about the "rebuilding" concept of their game, we would have better building mechanics without bullshit restrictions, be able to place items, workshops that actually saved what you worked on, and decent CAMP budgets. 
---
First of all One I bought and the other someone gave to me for free and it could of been duped cause why would you give one away? I didn‚Äôt care I took it shit free is free but I didn‚Äôt need two of them I was trying to sell one.  What‚Äôs so wrong about that? 
---
Should have gotten one a week ago when duping was a thing. Now you will be a mortal for life trying to PvP with the duper God's.
---
And I don't have dirty water nearby. Why not let us toggle which water to use at least? Maybe make food made with purified a bit better?
---
The only time it's happened to me, it was in a camp. Inside a house on a foundation. 
---
Calm down, Professor Chaos. Don't flood the earth by leaving your water hose on unattended. 
---
AFAIK, Fortnite is currently widely used in slow-mo money laundering by crime syndicates that obviously have a gaming division (it‚Äôs cyberpunk as hell). I don‚Äôt think FO76 has a player base large enough for successful obfuscation though.
---
Cool thanks for the tip
---
Yeah I did, didn't enjoy it either. 
---
If you know how people "argue" and the ways they supplement half facts with bullshit, you wouldn't give the narrative a break. 
---
Where did i say it hurt my feelings? Cucking, or Cuckholding is a sexual fetish, which some consenting adults enjoy. 
---
Anyone who uses it as an insult is probably too retarded to realise they're using it in the wholly wrong context, hence my saying i can't take you seriously at all
---
No. They don‚Äôt lol. 
---
Also can they tell me why the little blue cooler plan is almost 700 caps for one plan, but you can buy assorted lights for half that price. 
---
Also some of the names of plans are so completely non descriptive and you have no idea what you are buying. I know someone here was able to put together a visual guide, but plans should show a preview of the item you are buying, not an image of a piece of paper
---
Was it the NGE?  I started playing post-NGE, so I never knew the "old ways", but I hear about it frequently.  Sadly that also means the ghost towns were all over by then as well.
---
The horses there should be used to the Wendigos.
---
Dude there kill able but tanks as fuck with a regular handmade rifle usually around 100 shots will take them down 
---
What is fortnite?
---
I doubt luck affects which effects you get as it would require "luck" to know what effects you prefer. It could, of course look into your inventory/stash and increase the chances for items with the same type and existing legendary effects.
---
Luck, however, \*might\* affect how many stars you get when your character is the one triggering the location's respawn (at least I can imagine it with my programming experience). I have 4 luck and when I visit most other (i.e., not WS) legendary farming locations from youtube videos, 60% I don't get a legendary spawn at all.
---
As for the legendaries regaining health, it could programmatically involve one extra roll due to the regen, so the RNG may skip over a "lucky roll" when the loot is to be determined.
---
Raider at 15. I can tell interested parties where to find it.
---
This is a self admitted and flagged ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù, a wanted player. Do you think soldiers rush in to take out a terrorist and complain that they got attacked back, and it was possibly ‚Äúunfair‚Äù odds. Bottom line is if you seek a wanted player, you‚Äôre committing an act of pvp. If you can‚Äôt deal with a potential loss or death when YOURE the one with the first shot advantage, then I‚Äôm not really sympathetic.
---
Playing on PS4 
---
Had issue with mutations being inactive when a team invite is pending.
---
Power armour leg randomly un-equiping when entering power armour (happens constantly with various sets of PA)
---
Unable to repair or craft something when the exact materials required (only) are available.
---
When entering Monorail Elevator, button to go up spawns player at the bottom.
---
Not sure if this is intended but enemies (mainly scorched) do not drop the weapon on death that they have equipped.
---
Players randomly become invisible when fast travelling and entering power armour quite a lot.
---
Action points do not drain properly when sprinting sometimes.
---
Blue screens! I launched a nuke last night and within 20 minutes of the launch i had the application error message at least 5 times, certain it is not my console since it is a brand new PS4 pro. I love this game but you cant expect people to want to grind to launch a nuke when the game crashes this consistently.
---
This is not a bug but i think it should specify in the atom store what a skin is specifically for, i bought the combat armour camouflage and as soon as i reinforced the piece i could no longer see the paint. Waste of atoms definitely.
---
Love this game even with the bugs keep it up!
---
Who downvoted this? Better than I would have done.
---
it was a third person arcade style scrolling shooter where you just ran your toon from left to right machine gunning everything in your path. Story was non-existent (or if there was one it was so bad i cant remember it). 
---
Yeah I got the plans last night. Can't wait to get the Perks to install
---
&gt;" *What kind of moron pays actual money to buy things in a computer game?* "
---
A: anyone that values their time more than the money it takes to acquire the item. Especially when you need to farm RNG or have to play a game with people that have nothing but time to waste. 
---
I play War frame on Xbox which is F2P, everything is obtainable in game in addition to be able to be purchased via the cash. AND the cash shop currency is trade-able in game between players. Yet i value my time way more in that if its the week end and i wanna play with a new thing that was just added i can farm RNG for it, i can trade for it, I can bust out my Credit card and buy the cash shop currency for it.  
---
Iv'e probably spent like 400.00 in that game over the last 5 years. but then again im married and have 4 kids
---
And I‚Äôm telling you my honest answer to that when you said you ‚Äúhad a hard time believing it‚Äù lol 
---
Comparatively, I would agree given both teams' time frames. Not sure what the down votes are for, especially when speaking the truth here...
---
Also can confirm, almost 30, still call my dad, daddy. He is also saved as daddy in my phone. Some weird looks from friends when he texts or calls, but fuck em. I will always be a daddy's girl.
---
Cause he's probably lying?  Trying to get two people who upset him harassed.
---
The Player-Trade window is so obtuse it is just easier drop the items you want to exchange. Of course this glitch makes things more risky.
---
I‚Äôm having the same problem. Also with the photo challenge 
---
Yup, always do. Problem is cores get scrapped for junk if you're not careful. 
---
I'm starting to get concerned. I'm level 100+ with 170+ hours invested and I've yet to meet this guy. I MAY have come across him and his pack Brahmin's respective corpses a handful of times, but I never saw the name Grahm anywhere. Was more generic, like "traveling merchant," or possibly even "super mutant traveling merchant." 
---
Any case, I'm jealous.
---
I don't know why this is getting down voted, its the truth of Beth.
---
I leave my purifier unlocked in case someone wandering by needs it. I leave my doors unlocked so they can scrap/repair as needed. 
---
My lead extractor is locked. That lead is mine!
---
Nothing. I‚Äôm just saying I understand why they suspected you. I didn‚Äôt mean to word it like an accusation. 
---
All in all I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. Even if the weapons were duped, I don‚Äôt think you should be banned. You are an example of the negative repercussions caused by everyone crying about banning duper‚Äôs in this sub.   
---
That's actually the same where and when the only time I've seen him
---
I totally love that lamp, but I see where you‚Äôre coming from. ;)
---
Caliente‚Äôs beautiful bodies enhancer. It was on FO4 and Skyrim I think. Better body shape and textures. 
---
Tag screws so you can easily search for them, so when you hover over the item it will show a magnifying glass. That helped me a lot when I had barely 40 at around level 45 to make my Excavator PA. Now I have around 400~
---
"Everything I don't like is speculation"
---
That doesn't solve the strain on servers that adding more items to each players' stash will cause.
---
Oh, and invest at least one rank in Pharma Farma in the Luck tree. You can sell the meds you find and don't use.
---
Isn‚Äôt it funny ? One of the only NPCs give you so much joy....
---
If that is how you define "characters" (even including a person who only appears as a voice recording) then talk about setting the bar low... It blows my mind that you think this is even remotely comparable to the richness of characters in the previous games.
---
Yeah some of the prices don‚Äôt make sense. I generally assume there‚Äôs some curve on prices based on how much people might be willing to have everything in game. 
---
I have a mirelurk king as a pet i don't need a dog

3: Amazing environment, average dialogue.
---
NV: Amazing dialogue, terrible environment.
---
4: Average environment, terrible dialogue.
---
76: Amazing environment, terrible dialogue.
---
There‚Äôs my opinion.
---
I have tried multiple times to build a new camp, in multiple locations. I can do so, but I cannot place my house blueprint. There is nothing in the way and the ground is flat. My house has a lock on it in the stored bar. 
---
It's funny how
---
Rifleman gives me a 10% damage buff on my radium rifle that does 36 damage.
---
Slugger gives me a 10% damage buff on my super sledge that does 200+ damage.
---
So rifleman gives me an extra 3.6 damage while slugger basically gives me an extra radium rifle.
---
**RIFLE PERKS NEED A BUFF!!!!**
---
Oh look, this post again 
---
Big empty aka big mt. Far harbor aka bar harbor. Whitesprings aka the whitespring.

One of my buddies did this for a bit

Point Pleasant is pretty on point (pardon the pun) as well. At leas the parts they used. 
---
Yes!!!!
---
Perhaps it was 
---
Has the best stealth mod and its light
---
I thought that‚Äôs how Beth does it... while I‚Äôm away a bunch of fallout scorchbeasts fly around dropping all the junk around the map for me to collect
---
Follow the roads.  
---
It isn't the weight which is the issue. It is the number of unique items being tracked. The weight is just an abstract arbitrary restriction and the server would have to store both the out of stash weight and the in stash weight so server load would increase.
---
Very nice, what about gameplay between each? 
---
IIRC what I ended up doing was just hitting download / install and it ended up idling for about a minute and then finding the installed game and launching normally
---
I hope it's not a feature haha. If it scrolled the other way too it might be quite handy but as it stands it's just annoying.
---
It's 2nd floor, right side of the building after entering

My point exactly....but the email said ‚Äúsuspected for duplication of items‚Äù I had nothing in my inventory that would show proof of that. So idk how the fuck I got picked out or reported or whatever the case is that would make my account banned. 
---
Sorry, then? Usually the simplest answer with these things solves the problem. But sure. Investigate things your RAID 0 stuff. Likely culprit.
---
I dunno. I kinda like it. Just wish it was a different pattern.
---
One word: Csgo
---
I don't exactly feel like I'm missing out on anything. My standards are a bit higher than what this game has to offer...
---
Gt: SXDGRL
---
I‚Äôm on almost everyday! Would love to make more friends. I‚Äôm usually just building my camp over and over again and doing queen runs. Lol.
---
I get that but at the same time west Virginia aside from the notes and terminals and some quests in this game doesn't have much lore. Might as well be a place for multiplayer fun.
---
I did them both separate from the main 
---
I want your wood armor. Im trying to get full unyielding wood and am willing to pay. 
---
And level ?
---
What platform do you play on? If you are xbox I'd be down to hang out
---
This would be the nail in the coffin for the already near dead Pistol builds if moved to Agility.
---
I'd rather they merge Traveling Pharmacist with Thru Hiker. Too much perk bloat for carry weight.
---
I‚Äôm in the same predicament. Really want these plans:( 
---
Thank you so much :) this is exactly what I was looking for. Me and a buddy were developing our own route like this noting all the possible legendary spawns. Your contribution will be very helpful ^.^
---
LOL my wife just hit the max last night. She was like Ooooh bummer
---
I'll watch and let you know. Thank you for this! üòÅ
---
Im on PC :(
---
I'd like that, but it's probably too much in 1 perk for how much stimpacks weigh
---
It took me close to 100 hours (PC), then one day a group of 3 was going around destroying every camp on the server with explosive shotguns and then clearing their own 4-digit bounties.
---
You can pretty well guess where people's camps are by watching them on the map, if they aren't moving but aren't at a landmark either. I try to stealth at my camp but crafting stations take you out of it. I didn't have much to lose at mine, but I saw them destroy another camp that had a decon shower (requires flux to repair).
---
Cool. So do all my weapons get more powerful with me. How can I improve them some more. Just mods and plans?
---
Because weight reduction perks need to be spread across specials to allow for build flexibility.
---
So would I, actually. 
---
I agree with you. taking over a workshop should give you the chance to surrender or fight. not instant death.  
---
Workshops are just another way people can grief you. I like to call them Toxic Players.  
---
honestly you should take bloody mess because it frees up more cards in the respective perk trees. not because the damage is better. the point is that you increase your perk versatility.
---
&gt;English is not my fist language
---
Spanish? 
---
Yeah it happened a lot inside my built home before I started dropping 1 item then storing stuff in the bag.
---
I go to Morgantown a lot. Looks nearly like the game, damage and all. ü§£
---
Right point being that the actual weight of these items is arbitrary in comparison to the effect it has on server strain. A 1lb ripper takes no more resources than a 50 pound missile launcher, so I could have 600 different legendary rippers or 12 missile launchers and still won't get close to a duper's 1000s of various items and especially anyone that heavily collects costumes that weigh only .1 and don't stack 
---
PC and level 15 (decided to restart
---
Oh...that pain...yea...I use the furious .50...I don't bring it out unless there is a queen then it sits in storage for a few days to stockpile again
---
Different platform :(
---
It really feels like "blue screen/loading screen" simulator at this point. 
---
based on...?
---
These tubes emit some heat through the monitor
---
Ash Heap destroys me still haha. Just the ghouls and scorched wear me down.
---
Excavator PA and melee build everything will die.
---
Yeaaaah, that is cool :D.  
---
Maybe if we be a big community we can ask it for Bethesda :D
---
Yeah but strength has explosives and chems, agility and intelligence only have 1 for items.
---
Gotcha. Thanks
---
You‚Äôve again made zero counter-argument except to restate your opinion. What defines this richness for you that doesn‚Äôt exist? Is it your inability to seduce them or say stupid things to them? 
---
You don‚Äôt find a character that decides to buy into its own Hollywood personae to train orphans to be interesting? Or a woman that records her last days trying to hold it together until she realizes that the Scorched killed all her friends and no one is coming to be compelling? 
---
Perhaps I should take from your repeating yourself that you refer to NPCs who continuously complain about the heat of the Mojave and wish for nuclear winter. Boy that was funny the first three dozen times wasn‚Äôt it? Really made for immersive gameplay huh?
---
While I get what you are saying, inventory management is a fundamental part of any multiplayer survial game I have ever played or heard about. Regardless of the specific system, it is there to reenforce meaningful choices about what you loot and what you decide to leave behind. All of these games would be infinity easier, quicker to complete, and most fans of the genre would say much less interesting if inventories weren't a factor. Fallout actually has one of the most forgiving systems of any game in the genre until the end game that I am aware of. 
---
I am not saying you are wrong for wanting what you want or being frustrated by it, I am just pointing out that there are multiplayer survial fans here in fallout 76 (a multiplayer survial game) that if anything, would like the game to be a whole lot harder. Where we could probably both agree on however is that there should be some very high end late game storage option, one that probably enables more pvp options anyway. They need to sort out balance issues before that can become something good of course.
---
PvE can pick up a great perk called scavenger for ammo. There are all kinds of in-world fusion generators that have tasty power cores you can farm. Ran out of ammo and have to kill creatures with melee? Great PvE experience. You want MY fusion core generator at posiedon? Fight me for it.
---
No, Swedish acually!
---
Let us mail to our mule alts, do off-line characters add server strain?
---
You ain't missing much so don't worry lol
---
The 1 day hat is a must buy /s
---
Aw shame. There's loads of pc players on here though. I can agree in game interaction is unusual. Their is a lot of suspicion. Haha. 
---
I've been crashing every couple of minutes on my PS4. I pylled the atom paint off my T-60, since it started being really bad after I started using it, instead of my excavator. It mainly happens in Watoga and Whitesprings. It seemed better, bit the started up again, to the point of me wanting to rage quit yesterday. I swapped out with my excavator and raider, and I've noticed it burp and hitch in Whitesprings, but it hasn't crashed again. Now I'm wondering if it's the targeting on my T-60 helmet, because I had a few issues with the excavtor too, until I swapped the helmet out with a non-modded one. 
---
Ps4 pro here and this got so bad that my friend and I can't run Missile Silos because we already know we will crash and lose all progress .... Or worse. Launch a nuke and lose the server since we both crash. 
---
My group recently got into clearing silos as fast as possible, don't know of any way to skip the laser grid/mainframe core section legitimately. You can speed up the core installation process by having cores pre-made in advance, then taking them all off and installing one at a time (this usually prevents them from getting all laggy). Obviously skipping the reactor is a huge time save as well. 
---
Our current record is about 26 minutes from entering the silo to Queen death, with a large amount of possible time save.
---
All this stuff shouldn't even weight as much as it does without perks. It's a problem, these 6 perks are near mandatory for most players and it's lame. 
---
No the actual elevator has a person elevator at it's base, you can get to levels 2 and 3 depending on which one you use.
---
Ah I gotcha, thanks for the answer!
---
No all they do is fuck up the spawn for everyone.
---
don't go to your base when you have a bounty
---
That's the whole point. We can already collect 6000 costumes and hats, why not be able to reasonably store other items as well
---
I found them early on.  Near the door at Gauley Mine.  Probably a random world drop.
---
yup
---
The single most important thing this game could add/change, for me, is adding persistent servers. I would buy 3 copies today for me and my boys. 
---
Lol I do not care what level they are, what gets me are the people that stand around doing nothing watching everyone fight the queen. If these people were actually doing something I would not mind what level they were but they are legitly standing around and watching everyone spend resources. They are usually within the 15-80 range.
---
I have a plain 1\* instigating Lever Rifle that absolutely rocks with my sneak build.  5 shots = 5 kills in most situations.  adding +VATS crit would not really do much more than it does now because a single shot is enough.  if fighting SBQ or other 3\* mobs only that first shot would make full use of the legendary effects - in which case i am swapping to a different weapon completely.
---
but overall i agree with the premise in the OP.   there should a a series of quests to unlock a legendary crafting workbench.  make us farm/quest for the components as well.  that would help end the grind of farming the same handful of areas where we mostly find golf clubs and wooden crap. 
---
‚ÄúYou fucked with the wrong monkey‚Äù
---
This won't help you find them in-game but I just found r/fo76bazaar and bought the plans for 600 caps. I don't even care anymore. I was desperate. The person I bought them from has one more set left if you want to go check it out.

That's just so cool! So jealous of how neat that'd be. As you or your step-dad (and not to be awkward but points for a step-dad bonding moment eh?)

*Gen X‚Äôrs who stayed up too late on Saturday fist bump*

Lately on Xbox seems like it‚Äôs not been getting nuked as much. Seems like less nukes happening in general.

---
Caliente's Beautiful Body Enhancer or something like that.
---
Uhuh. Proof? 
---
Yes. Sucks! 
---
Half the issue is balancing, lots of overpowered weapons and armour, other half is slap and how it's so weird to get into PVP.  If weapons were actually balanced and PvP was always on, with an option to forgive bounties and take youself off the map things would be much better.  I hope this is what PvP mode becomes.
---
yeah it sucks, but I think that's what they were aiming for sadly 
---
You can get them fairly regular by taking over public workbenches. 
---
yep, this has been brought up a ton after the last patch.. The worst part, is that you can't go back the other way on the slider after it resets
---
I have seen another hangman somewhere I didn't pay much attention to. It's on a chalkboard somewhere...
---
What.
---
I had to uninstall and reinstall because the latest update corrupted game data causing me to crash every other old screen.
---
That's poop.
---
I'll be dropping stuff like 2 star armor, whatever halfway decent weapons I don't feel like selling
---
It‚Äôs really incredible to see the brightest of this sub come together and speculate on the duping subject. If having more than 20.000 of any ammo type instantly bans you, then I‚Äôd be banned 15 times over right now. 
---
They said they were looking at rare materials in bulk numbers. Not ammo.
---
Yeah they hit it with the bug hammer
---
I just got the handmade plans from patrol duty last night, I‚Äôm level 80. You‚Äôre telling me a vendor has had them this whole time?!
---
What? Are people really struggling with level 3 locks? Takes 30 seconds and 2 Bobby pins at most. It‚Äôs always faster plus you save durability. As for the terminal, select 3 and then use the glitches to eliminate the wrong one or to reset your tries and you‚Äôll only have the correct one left.
---
That is very cool! 
---
Don't think it's the not the other way around here, plus were a minority compared to the entirety of all four of those other larger sub reddits.
---
This is a massive requirement that Bethesda need to take seriously. They seem to have neglected just how to manage the players who came into this with a desire to play solo, or even socially, but not engage in any sort of PvP. Yet time and again, the people who want to seem to always find a way to harass and grief and make the game unpleasant for others, getting some sadistic joy from the process. Since Bethesda won't ban these types of players and griefers, prevent them from being able to do the very thing they want to that is allowing them to be so destructive.
---
Have you played this game at all? 
---
you‚Äôll have to get new weapons eventually because a regular level 20 hunting rifle wouldnt work at level 50+ and so on but if you find one that works well at the moment you can mod that and once you find a better one just mod the new one and scrap the old one. if you find a good legendary with an appropriate level it can last for a really long time but the normal ones have to change a lot in both level and mods
---
What makes this a BoS camp? I'd never know just walking up on it.  Sux we can't get BoS flags or insignia to put on walls.  I have neon signs so under the welcome sign it says "BOS" not sure what else to do.
---
Yes! 
---
It was NGE
---
Yeah, it sucks alright. If you use your mouse to move the bar though it will stop on 0!
---
I'm shocked more aren't in str tbh.
---
Str effects carry weight afterall.
---
How does being smarter make you carry better?
---
I've been wanted to complete the misc quest at the golf course for ages. I'm level 177 if it makes you feel any better, lol. Damn golf ghouls never show up. 
---
But, if you're on PC and like some of your guns modded out or want a particular weapon (I can craft most of them with most mods unlocked) let me know. I don't charge anything. Ign is the same as on here. I can clear out Whitesprings for ya if you wanna grab those holotapes or whatever. 
---
That's what I've been doing all week. ): They're completely elusive to me. I ended up trading for a set but I'm still determined to find them organically in-game.
---
Reducing the nominal weight while in stash is exactly the same as increasing stash size as far as the server is concerned.
---
Makes it a huge pain to drop/gift ammo or junk now
---
It's untameable
---
No iron sights killed 3 for me.
---
How is that dramatic? That's normal behavior right? 
---
The struggle is real, such a lack of BoS items, did my best with what I had ü§ê
---
Which mod? I currently use a mish-mash of gear with chameleon and harder to detect while stealthed and I havn't been seen in ages.
---
They are good dogs.
---
Why so serious?  Sure it‚Äôs sucks to have that happen to you but that‚Äôs part of the wasteland survival experience.  
---
No you won‚Äôt lose your saves. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to help your constant crashing that‚Äôs pretty common sadly 
---
I don‚Äôt think so I have other Xbox at home where I pop the disc and the characters are there.
---
I believe they are tied to your Beth account 
---
As far as pieces fitting together, I've noticed on my simple roof (a square with 2 flat roofs in the back and 2 simple downward slopes in front) that on the sides, the sloping pieces stick out farther than the flat pieces. They create a small overhang on the sides that the flat pieces don't. Mostly only noticeable it you make it onto the roof, at least.
---
One other tiny gripe I have with the roof pieces is that I can't hang my strands of decorative lights (christmas or white ones) from the outdoor edge of the roof (i.e. where tons of people hang their christmas lights). They only fit on the interior part of the roof or the underside of wooden floors.
---
Ooo I'm gonna add that to my list of places to search. Thanks for the info. (:
---
By trying to be snarky, you‚Äôre missing the point. Both sides of the transaction are involved in laundering.
---
Reinstall the game or rebuild your database.
---
My launch ps4 averages a crash every 10 hours. I counted in my error log
---
Imagine if NV had the double the time. It could possibly even beat down Skyrim.
---
**FISHLAMP FOREVER.**
---
Oh wow. I'd thought about using them that way recently but figured I'd just leave myself open to dying.
---
I've got a C.A.M.P. suspended over a river, and yeah, the water underneath still ripples when it rains. 
---
Your character is in the cloud so you should be good. But before you uninstall/reinstall I know on PS4 you can rebuild your data base, which some people have claimed helped them with similar issues. If you can do something similar on Xbox I'd say try that first.
---
My non-explosives guy has both the quantum and nuka versions.
---
My explosives guy has only the quantum. :/
---
Honestly, I dont blame him for his thoughts or the narrative. The game is *at best* a beta version of an actual decent game. Going f2p at this point would be a redeeming quality. 
---
Funny thing is, all the people going "thank goodness it's not f2p, all the hackers and trolls!" Yeah, that doesnt ring any bells that the game isn't put together well or anything? There are plenty of f2p games out there with little to no cheating, but fo76 needs a literal paywall to protect it? 
---
Not that I personally care. Wouldn't play the game if it was free anyway. The game is basically just a shit asset re-assembly of fallout 4, which wasn't really that good either. 
---
It somehow affects energy ammo, and being more athletic makes food weigh less somehow, dont know.
---
Beth has definitely lied to us and themselves before.
---
It is exactly as others have said.(about the higher level players spawning the higher levels)  I had the same issue and was beyond frustrated before I figured that out because I would be going around doing those quests at around lvl 25 and I would either see enemies that were 1-6 or enemies that were 67ish.  Learned to server hop and surprise level 25 enemies.  I didn't wanna be a server hopper cause it felt like cheating but it kinda becomes necessary. 
---
Bunch of crystal nodes in lucky hole mine (lead too) just bring long your ExPA
---
 On my level 40 its straight to the nearest bot for maybe 35 caps. You would not believe what he sells. ;)
---
 I did the same thing in Fallout 4. There are so many useless Legendaries.
---
I didn‚Äôt post this for ppl to be dicks about it just looking for some answers
---
Goddamit karen, not everybody wants to put all the points in charisma..
---
No, there is only Dogmeat. Ever since the Vault Dweller emerged from the Holy Vault 13 and laid his eyes on this lovable canine companion in Junktown (or Scrapheap if you played the demo), there is no other dog in existence that shall be revered.
---
Although K-9 and Cyberdog were fun as well. OK, I'll allow Rex. 
---
You have contracted Rad Worms.
---
Also, the compass icons are just generally harder to see in power armor. My friend always plays in power armor, and he has perception 12+ (not sure if that matters) and I see map icons way sooner than they are visible on his PA hud compass. But my perception is only 6.
---
That was me and my kids when we went to DC after playing Fallout 3.
---
:D
---
Thanks! Off on a cryptid hunt, I go
---
What about cats?
---
well explosive and two shot are getting a debuff from 100% to 25% so less useful then before 
---
that said that is with legends as they are now making the idea so that as new legendarys are added we can keep adding and swapping old weapons we liked abilities 
---
Oh man, that decontamination room. So claustrophobic. I don't think some current senators could fit down that hallway...
---
I have heard it is updating when it does that.  Have also had it happen.
---
Disease Cure (X)
---
I'll google it and see if it's possible, thanks!
---
Most or all of the workshops are unclaimed on every server I go to. They're not hugely popular.
---
Nobody cares if their workshop is attacked though. They're lost on logout anyways.
---
Yep, i just screenshot them to save to the console. Sucks to not have them all available as loading screens, though.
---
Maybe try posting over at [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals)?
---
Chill folks, and they do some group events sometimes. I'm on PC but I don't get to play enough to be much fun to hang around with. Each week: Three hours collecting/scrapping/crafting and three hours of questing/exploring/whatever.
---
I stopped collecting boiled water after level 15. That shit is everywhere.
---
I dropped 80 of it as i had 200 in my stash. 
---
I don't even run pumps anymore as fruit juice is so plentiful.
---
That all seems a bit much.
---
I mostly think weapon durability has massive imbalances and needs to be fixed asap. Energy guns break within minutes. Some auto guns break within a half hour, which is also pretty bad for gameplay flow.
---
Apart from Pistols, dmg isn't so bad. Although that remains to be seen after TSE nerf.
---
I would definitely start grinding to get this perk card. Drop whatever world saving quest I'm doing and don't stop till I've got my doggie. 
---
Well its good to know either way, thanks for your reply. 
---
that would be magical
---
Sweet.
---
Nerds need to take more road trips! Still have Fahhh Hahbahh' on my list for the NE.
---
I know the Jeep you speak of, I found a lab coat in there the other day.
---
And the Gyro Captain can have the tin. 
---
Lol, I started on it in October just before the BETA. I would sometimes go weeks without touching it due to playing the game or other obligations. There was a lot of new things to learn along the way so progress was slow and frustrating at times.
---
I've got two dog helmets that indicate it's coming eventually :)
---
The issue is that, this version of "PvP" was not what was supposed to be at launch. The had to neuter the PvP because solo players didn't want it.
---
&gt;I'm not really certain what this mode is adding to my gaming experience.
---
It was *supposed* to add the human variable to the mix. Every time you meet someone...can you trust them? Will they betray you? Will you work together towards a common goal and become friends, or will one of you have a different idea in mind?
---
All of that is out the window. So, there's your answer.
---
see I don't want to min max I just want to build a themed character like a medic but still have him able to survive when walking around by himself or a scavenger with pipe rifles and ratty looking armor but I'm forced into power armor and tse weapons because of the unbalanced nature of legends as they are now
---
I have this same piece my favorite for the weapon reduction weight :)
---
Under 500 at this point.
---
There, you will see what FO76 was SUPPOSED to be. 
---
It was disappointing. They need a quarry like New Vegas where they breed. There should be a deathclaw type boss like the scorchbeast queen, deathclaws are such a staple to fallout. 
---
Not trying to be asinine. It is just any time I ever post about performance issues or bugs, some says "I don't have the issue". 
---
Considering that testing the RAID 0 would require moving the game files, I will test that much later. It shouldn't be the issue. It was on RAID since the BETA and I have 64 PCIe lanes connected straight to the CPU. Don't get much better than that. 
---
You're delusional if you think you're still having fun with this game this many months into it, I got it in December and it can't force myself to get back into the game, there's literally nothing to do.
---
It is strange but on the other hand if they change this then there will be endless waves of people complaining that they used up all their purified water crafting corn soup. 
---
I have the same issue. On PC (new with nvidia 2080, 32 GB ram etc) and I crash straight to desktop a lot now. More than during beta.
---
What annoys me the most is that there is never a crash report function to send a crash code to Beth. I really hope they gather this data without me knowing because if the rely on their bad ticket system it is a bloody joke.
---
Rant over... i love Fallout but these crashes are getting to me. I play with friends all the time and it is more or less the same for all.
---
i support this approach.  it would be a sure-fire way to give value to those 1\* and 2\* items that are otherwised dumped into little paper bags because the vendor is out of caps and you don't want to waste the stash space.  I found a good piece of weightless armor last night that i would love to use but i'd have to give up my 2\* piece I already have.  being able to craft that weightless effect onto my current armor would be ideal.  sure, make it hard/expensive but make it possible. 
---
I get the stuck load screen on fast travel from time to time. Xbox here.
---
I'd actually like that concept since then at least I could choose what armor or weapon to put it on
---
it‚Äôs amazing, man. i absolutely love this its so photorealistic. way better than bethesda‚Äôs concept art if i‚Äôm giving mho. üòç 
---
So make a perk card for PvE players to participate in the event when I drop a nuke.
---
I love Rose on Raider Radio. I just wish it played some music. Or old timey commercials, news bulletins and radio dramas, all stuck on a loop from the last days of the world. Have Rose break it up with her insane gibberish and comment on the stuff "Fun fact kiddos! Abraxo cleaner isnt just great for getting bloodstains out, you can mix with battery acid and fermented mutfruit to get a great high! It only burns your lungs a little bit!"
---
It's really incrediable when someone comes and tries to make themselves look better by attacking others.
---
You said: They said they were looking at rare materials in bulk numbers
---
Why, look what I said before you: unreasonable amounts of rare items, like 50,000 ballistic fibers and such
---
Amazing! I said that thing you said before you said it.
---
The thing is. Fuel isn't the most common ammo. Chances are to get 20,000 fuel you either made it. Or it was duped.
---
Well a level 20 player wouldn't have access to Ammo smith or the Super Duper perk. So to make that much fuel to just drop, they would need 200,000 acid, 100,000 oil, and 40,000 steel.
---
Maybe this level 20 spent levels 1-20 collecting just oil, acid and steel so they could make fuel to level up. 
---
Or maybe they were a duper. 
---
This is how it's done. This is what I have done in every single fallout and now it's gone. I miss it.
---
Ok i might have to look that up..oopsy daisy!
---
But that would be a weirdly specific translation.and even tho i switched from the haters camp back to the fans as soon as i started playing, i can imagine them translating it that way with the tought of being able to place bobbleheads in PREVIOUS titles without being aware how fucked up it is to give that hint without it being possible in 76..
---
They did nerf hopping.
---
Stash all your junk to craft.
---
And the dc's are network related.  Either wait for more netcode updates or try and make your setup better
---
That's how I feel, I have a couple level 100 and I made another new guy, never once seen him. 
---
deathclaw island with one deathclaw...not even a strong one. &gt;:( 
---
What if they don‚Äôt have a mic?
---
Beat me to this post.  Clearly I want you to have the water or I would have locked the purifier. 
---
Yeah and a couple hours ago ESO literally post a fallout 76 title with. "Fallout 76 going free to play?" And then shows the tweet right away but says not to trust them because they lied about only cosmetic atom shop stuff talking about the lunch boxes making the game p2w but from all the footage we've seen with the lunchboxes it seems purely cosmetic.
---
No, you can for sure farm at a workshop. 
---
But someone is going to come gunning for it. 
---
At this point, you have 2 options:
---
1.) Fight for and defend the workshop, or
---
2.) Don't try to take the workshop, and no one will ever kill you.
---
Folk still claim them.  Folk still attack them.  If there is no PvP then there would be no way to take one that‚Äôs been claimed.  You‚Äôd have to wait for that person to log off.  Does that honestly sound acceptable to you?
---
It would be. It's not really near any major metropolitan area (which is part of the reason that location was selected), so you'd have to fly into an international airport and then probably get at least one, maybe two, connecting flights to get to Charleston, WV and drive from there.
---
I am against this idea. First of all, I built around team medic, pharma farma, and traveling pharmacy. So you'd be forcing a lot of people to completely respec. I'm already using my other stats for other things, so no thanks. Second, you can get by without it, just show a little disciplne. On my characters without Traveling Pharmacy, I just keep a minimum of meds on my person. When your build comes together, you will need less and less.

And the quarry was the shit for that. I still like the original Deathclaw nest in FO1; there weren't a ton of them but it was terrifying because you had to fight/sneak past them to get the kind of equipment you could actually kill them with haha
---
Don't go to the pvp workshop then? 
---
And with gamestop
---
I had a dude follow me around trying to convince me to sell him the socks I was wearing.
---
Some guys can be so fucking weird.
---
We really need it for barns also. We just need alot more roof options
---
You moved twice in a short time frame. The price skyrockets doing that
---
I just answered your question. 
---
To be fair it is pretty empty and it did lose a lot of players in the first two months, I mean the hate train of people who never played the game had to be informed by someone else and that's the tons of people who gave up on this game.
---
Thank you both! :)
---
Simply making the perk cards that affect item weight work with items in the stash and not just your inventory would be a nice start. 
---
Half of the stuff I just keep on my character because I've invested in these perk cards that actually make my QoL worse. 
---
I‚Äôve came across a dog helmet/armor so , maybe we get pups one day?
---
I've bought 2 from a player, 250 caps each.   
---
See r/fo76FilthyFleaMarket   
---
It should not be big issue to implement such a system. At the moment  the system maybe prioritizing to fill less populated servers. At least while entering a new server it is often one where the SBQ just has been killed and players left the server.
---
Support seems to be back logged for weeks. Took them 3 weeks to get back to me on a seperate issue. With all these bans coming in I'm sure they are even more backed up.
---

Team Owned Settlements 
---
I got a bit frustrated with the wanted system this weekend. I was running around and came across this level 3 guy in Flatwoods and at the start just wanted to offload some spare bulk materials I couldn't sell because i reached the meager 200 cap vendor limit. I passed off the materials and he asked to team up. Alas, the game was buggy and I couldn't accept the invite. I tried to then invite him, but he was supposedly already in a group, probably the one he made that I couldn't join.
---
We did a daily event and I motioned him to follow me to a workshop which he claimed and we again tried to team up, but it was too buggy. I wandered around and wanted to unlock a safe for him and instantly became wanted for some reason, I guess unlocking a safe for him. Since we couldn't team up I left and just started wandering around. Eventually, 3 other players show up, and as I am minding my own business killing ghouls, I hear "just kill this guy." This guy walks up to me and just one shots me with melee. Great. 
---
Try to help a low level player and end up getting murdered. At least the wanted level went away, but damn, the system is pretty crappy to get punished for wanting to help. 
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool. 
---
All the shit I read about griefers but it seems to me I read more and witness more people being helpful than anything else. 
---
I have yet to find an explosive anything and knowing my luck it‚Äôll probably end up being and explosive pitchfork with a faster reload :/
---
Even had a couple dudes msg me asking if I needed help launching the nuke. They must have noticed my dot at Charlie being there for more then an hour lol. 
---
I did, they joined we launched. Good times. 
---
Option 1 go get one option 2 stand there doing the trade emote and if I see it maybe I'll trade. 
---
So that makes the proven false rumor of free to play true now?
---
they actually stated they plan to start adding new drop locations but that is less a legendary option then a lack of content concept then really the legends fault 
---
personally I feel nukes should be more difficult as I've seen 5 launched in a hour on weekends and that kind of seems ridiculous to me
---
I accidently droped a nuke on moo moo, there she was lying in a crater next to prime like I'd gotten ah direct hit. It saddened me deeply, even my teammates paused for a second. Graham remained to be seen.
---
Ah, appreciate it! I remember two shot from Fo4 haha, definitely a great effect. 
---
Yea, instead we got crashes to desktops, unfinishable/untriggerable missions, 4 voice actors for hundreds of characters, lost saves, and countless others.
---
They‚Äôve always been broken.
---
see I love crafting and hate the fact even as a 15 int character I'll never be able to craft anything worth a damn at late game
---
And ballistic ammo and armor
---
He can, the other redditor is mixing it all up. Grahm has a random chance of having the plans at any level, though you can get the plans from watoga but only above level 12 and below a certain level. Also you can grind for them like you said. 
---
Maybe dont buy a pvp game then? Wait for Fallout 5. its like saying Remove the online part of Elder Scrolls Online...NO...you just sit tight and wait for Elder Scrolls 6.
---
I understand the respec thing, it's unlikely this will change, but I'm hoping they can refund the points and if we had the cards they would just be moved to the respected special slot.
---
And as far as the server is concerned a minigun and a ripper are no different so why shouldn't the stash reflect that
---
oh hey, that's good to know.  Two of my characters are non-PA users.
---
Does it rubber band you when you enter?
---
Literally unplayable
---
Gun builds fall into 3 groups with 1 being nerfed shortly.
---
Either explosive 2 shot, vats or bloodied.
---
Normal rifles without one of those 3 isn't that strong overall.
---
I'll take one Greyhound, please.
---
I am very much against buying atoms, but if bethesda make a greyhound that will roach on the couch in my camp, i'll just mail them my wallet.  They can take what they feel is appropriate from it.  Then keep the rest.  I may have a problem.
---
\#GreyhoundAddiction
---
This is awesome
---
Okay now that is trippy as fuck
---
Thank you for your helpful input that‚Äôs all I wanted to know. 
---
No the principal reason why nobody is interested in work shops is because the loot is not worth the time and once you build up your area you typically dc anyways. Workshops was ment to be pvp locations. To be taken with risk of pvp to be taken with a team and defended. If your low lvl you shouldn't even be trying to take a workshops and if you get killed because your trying to hold onto a workshops thats your own problem. You knew the risk. Go play pve on all other places on the map and stop crying. 
---
We have the same problem on PS4. I personally don't like the idea of blind trades. I've seen people use it as a distraction to attack a base. Gets annoying. But yeah there is a trade emote and it's not hard to use.
---
And walls
---
I wonder if this works for stuff like firecaps and bloodleaf for disease cures
---
Try rejoining the server, or putting the materials in your stash.
---
Why did you pay for that version I mean you knew what it was right? I feel bad for people who bought it and thought they would actually get something worthwhile from it.
---
Anyone knows ho much dense/ padded armor mod gives explosive resistance?
---
&gt; Not sure how much the hotel itself is but I would venture a guess it's a pretty penny (but maybe less in the off-season).
---
I checked a not-Valentines-Day weekend in Feb. and the cheapest rooms for 2 adults are about $268 a night.
---
The cottages are 400+ a night.
---
Not sure you will like it there, i think you will have your little kid ass handed to you, there will not be the defenseless carebears there who you can just kill easy.I can envision you being teabagged while you rage quit, running back to fortnite. 
---
see, i can respect this opinion. It's okay to not like a game, we all have different tastes, but having the ability to respect other people's opinions seems hard to come by these days. Please, sir, take my upvote. 
---
They should just put respec tokens on the atom store. Kinda like ESO.
---
Married with 4 kids and you have a spare 400? ;) tell me your secret (married with 4 kids and 2 dogs).
---
I‚Äôm in no rush to finish this, I enjoy the experience. I don‚Äôt mind farming and I don‚Äôt mind not having everything in the game. On my second character now and they are nothing like the first, purely because of the stuff (weapons/armour) I‚Äôve picked up this time round. So each new character is a new experience. Yes, time is an issue, but this is my hobby, my ‚Äòme-time‚Äô so I make it happen.
---
Cats make terrible dogs.
---
I‚Äôve stopped doing them as white spring just doesn‚Äôt drop legendary loot like it did and sbq either not enough turn up, or the server is full of low levels and people can‚Äôt join.
---
Agreed. I only trade with people I know and trust. Shooting someone is no way to get someone to trust you. 
---
Better looking bodies, nude optional.
---
I don't care if there's no nude option, modders have proven to make better stuff than developers have time for
---
he‚Äôs like the t-1000 from the terminator movies. 
---
Have either all the materials on you, or all in the stash. I had this happen and that‚Äôs how I fixed it
---
There is a place you can camp (I don't want to give it away completely since my camp is there) near a billboard that has 4(!) Cats that spawn there. A tabby, orange, and two black cats.
---
They count as enemies (which I hate because I can't fast travel from my camp) but it's like basically having pets.
---
How much is it during a golf tournament or car show?
---
Is that, technically, a word?
---
It was doing this with my explosive shotgun the other day, I had to let someone in my group repair it for me and after that it let me repair it again. 
---
99! Love that show! Did you happen to bring ghoul slaying gear just in case?
---
I use the little emote things. Those usually get people‚Äôs attention. 
---
I currently main wood armor and run around with 3star opp I cue smashing shit. Im having a blast. 
---
I mean they need a deathclaw boss in 76. Or a more deathclaw potent area. Yea there is where the Enclave starts but big whoop 2 of them sometimes 3. Could you imagine a swan sized deathclaw swinging at your head like a golf ball? Ouch!
---
This is as close as I have seen in game:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/ait2gh/mountain_scout/
---
I saw a missile turret firebase get put down once in the middle of a queen fight once. It was pretty helpful. What you described sounds pretty scummy, but it‚Äôs just another way to play. Welcome to the wasteland. 
---
See, I've got weeks of this being my primary game. In no way, shape, or form is it only valuable if you get all of the content for *free* with added pay to win. I got my moneys worth very quickly. I've played plenty of Free to Play games, and each one gets uninstalled within a few hours for the same reason. They're clear piles of shit built to nickel and dime you. That is NOT what this game is, despite what a bunch of opinions from non-participating profit motivated shit stirring talking heads will tell you.
---
While I get that it might not be your cup of tea, the critiques you're making just aren't valid criticisms. They're the same tired lines people here are really tired of rolling their eyes at because they've actually played the game. 
---
The whole idea behind the stash limit is to make you choose what you want to store. 
---
This just undos that.
---
They are going to increase the stash limit at some point. But they I don't think they will ever remove it. I think 800 would be good. And quests that allow you increased stash limits would be good.
---
People just have to weight. get it?
---
Wait and learn to manage themselves and what they pick up. 
---
Maybe not so bad if you equip the Travel Agent perk...
---
That monkey was full of Daddy-O and Daytripper.
---
Now you need Addictol.

Oh shucks, in my 150+ hours I don't think i've hit a road yet. Ill have to look for them. Thanks for the pro tip.
---
The eternal loading screens are the worst. When‚Äôs the next update supposed to be?
---
When her health glitch resets after spending 800 rounds getting her to 20%...
---
Then damage slows to a crawl as you realise people are running out of bullets.
---
Then a TSE shotgunner pops out of the woodwork to save the day.
---
What a roller-coaster. 
---
I'm fully aware of the current options.
---
My point is that segregation is wrong!
---
That PvE player not be allowed to participate in an important function of the game because they don't want to PvP, unless they volunteer to do something they don't want to do.
---
The OP suggested that is unfair and I agree. You suggested that they just deal with it and go find some sucky less efficient way to do it. I suggested that PvP players be forced to go find some sucky less efficient way to farm high level gear......of course you don't like that idea though.
---
After throwing a grenade at a pack of wolves, only for one two survive with his back legs crippled (same animation as downed Dogmeat in 4) and yelping, I don't think my heart can bear having a dog only to be killed by griefers or mobs. 
---
Gotta meet my overhead, son. 
---
While that is the smart decision, I needed to repair my things badly and made the unfortunate decision to give away my base location. Not smart on my behalf sure but the door was wide open he could have just killed me, but no he had to level the entire compound.
---
That is true, even if a friend looks in the bag it will give you the message that it's been looted. The bag will still be there though in the last death location. I dont go back for dropped items when dying so I keep that quest inactive. I know a buddy of mine has to go make it active every so often because he runs into the same thing. 
---
if it's verdant season in areas where they are growing, I would hope so. Though bloodleaf is so common around Flatwoods. Firecaps are kind of easier to find in the forest as well. 
---
It‚Äôs a level 21 each time. You can spawn it, swim to the other shore and then snipe it, if you can‚Äôt handle it outright.
---
But yeah, agree, more deathclaws please Beth!! Way more!
---

I can see if it was helpful...but this guys intentions was not to help...he was helping himself to free caps lol. 
---
Holy shit the buses too? Wow so cool 
---
"it just works"
---
I may get down-voted, but I wouldn't even mind if I had to load it with something like flux or different nuclear materials to recharge a fusion core.. 
---
I could finally get rid of the 92 I have in inventory. This "recharger" can solve a lot of issues for players AND Bethesda, while adding some extra end-game content
---
It‚Äôs somewhat really fucking annoying. And I am not easily annoyed. 
---
only idiots go into that event, and or any blast zone, without pacifist. it‚Äôs always a must for me when entering the SBQ event, cause u can‚Äôt prevent other idiots from placing a camp for whatever reason. hell, i place some down myself cause my weapons broken or i‚Äôm overweight. but thing is, i always store what i place down immediately because some players don‚Äôt turn in pacifist instinctively. 
---
I agree with that. 
---
Deathclaws in this game disappoint me. I'm used to seeing them and running the other direction. But I have more problems with Mirelurk Spawn than I do with level 91 glowing Deathclaws...sad.
---
Ok, I'll try both options right now
---
FYI - if you touch it, even to add stuff, the other player gets the "Another player has taken your loot" message.  As a result, they may never come back to get it.
---
My step dad is the best person in the world.  If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be who I am today.  
---
After explaining the game to him, and fast travelling places and showing him, seeing the awe on his face was surreal.  He was also so.... proud.  Like, he got all teared up just over a game.  Because it was WV.  Because it was our home.
---
He's just the best :)
---
Yeah, with that, fireproof and some other damage reduction gear you're almost invincible against TSE weapons in PvP lol.  Not sure why but people seem to want to ignore this information or stop people from finding it out xD
---
From the realm of the daedra, just like the knife in Skyrim.
---
shhh let them be upset
---
Platform?
---
I admit I‚Äôm guilty of slapping my base down in the middle of the fight..
---
I‚Äôve never seen a lot of people get flagged but if people go up on top of it and the SBQ is targeting you she won‚Äôt land.
---
Had one guy tell me the missle turrets shoot the bodies away their trying to loot.
---
I admit it‚Äôs stupid to do but I can‚Äôt resist it.
---
I will lead people to a stash, have them store their junk and then I'll kill them if they want to get rid of their status. 
---
Most people have been really nice about killing me, so I try to return the favor.
---
There have been a few times I've gotten wanted status and I honestly have no idea what I did. Once I opened a supply drop not realizing those are intended for a certain player. Once I unlocked someone's camp to use their crafting tables.  Once I open a supply drop thinking it was mine, while mine was actually on the other side of the building!
---
None of my friends plays Fallout 76, sadly :(

700 unmodded hours in 3, 400 unmodded hours in NV, several hundred modded in 4, never finished it or any dlc (got bored), several hundred in 76 (getting bored).

They should have left the log/relog bug in place until they get the server situation sorted. If I'm burning through cores in a blast zone and disconnected because of shit servers the least you could do is top me off on relog.
---
I ran into same crap there. Radscorpion liked to spawn at bottom of elevator. Many a deaths
---
I ran into him for the first time last night outside the sons of Dane? Location on the road.  He only had funny dialog, nothing I wanted to buy, was hoping for handmade rifle plans.  Actually I think I bought a new bed from him since I thought about how gross the one I currently have in my camp was.  
---
I feel like if you have less caps than your level then you don't get to do PvP. It should auto put you in passive.
---
If you're racking up a bounty the moment you meet your cap total you're blocked from doing more. Those caps get reserved so that you can't spend them or use them in trades until the bounty is clear.
---
Also friends and teammates should be unable to clear you of your bounty.
---
Ever get a fix? Experiencing same issue
---
Commie want us to fight each other.

Excellent job with the poses!

Two friends of mine have been leveling alt toons and are both shotgunners and have lvl 15 TSE shotguns, and carrying my gunslinger build that I‚Äôve been role playing as a policeman. I‚Äôm using exclusively pistol/baton. We been following the main story and just completed bos story line at lvl 30 XD.  I‚Äôm not even helpful at all. Tonight we become enclave generals. 
---
I hate wearing mismatched awful looking armor combinations because the legendary effects are much too powerful, and the differences in defense are pretty minimal.

Dude, you found the N64 mode!

Pretty much what its turned into for me. Its so rare i have the ability to fast travel anywhere, just slowly stomping around to each destination.

I‚Äôve stopped launching Nukes because I play solo 75% of the time, and my game crashes 100% of the time I enter a nuke zone.  Not having the ability to rejoin the previous server I was in meant I‚Äôm not wasting my time launching a nuke I can‚Äôt even participate in.

Yea literally sat there for a good hour or 2 doing nothing but getting acid yesterday

As other have noted taking screenshots on Xbox is a quick method, but to add to this - one can then upload those screenshots directly to OneDrive through the Captures section on the Xbox. When the Xbox uploads them it will provide you a full resolution PNG and a JXR (Jpeg XR - Better compression Jpeg with lossless, transparency and tile structure support as well as better color accuracy). This are what I used to capture images for my recent C.A.M.P. showcase on r/fallout76settlements :: [UberToast's Clifftop C.A.M.P.

Out of curiosity, how can you farm One of Us? I haven't started it yet, but as far as I know it's a main quest and isn't intended to be repeated. I'm after the TFJ myself so I'd love to know how to farm what is currently the most reliable quest for rewarding it.
---
I play games with my kids regularly.  we even party up to play dota2.  I had to buy 3 minecraft accounts years ago so all three of us could play together, and then stood up an old PC to be the dedicated local minecraft server.  terraria, borderlands 2, tera, dont starve.  I love being able to game with my kids. 
---
I actually like the ridiculous outfits and running around looking silly. There should be options for both types of players though. But from my experience most of the things I find in the game are more serious, lore-fitting outfits.
---
Additionally, I would be willing to bet at a company the size of BGS they have a team analyzing the sales in the Atomic Shop and tailoring future items accordingly. 
---
Lol, I understand the frustration. Personally, I always have pacifist mode on to avoid catching an unintentional bounty on my head.  That‚Äôs goes double for queen fights. 
---
The reason it is more efficient is because of the difficulty. If you got rid of the pvp, how would you balance it? It is *literally* the one way a PvPer has an advantage in the game and people bitch lmao. 
---
Also, I mostly PvE/Solo in 76. But I am still aware that there is 1 single thing for PvPers, so I don't go for the workshops unless I am ready to fight. 
---
I was taken out in pacifist mode in a couple of shots. He then became wanted, so i proceeded to engage out of pacifist mode since i felt like i had an advantage with ranged sniper, to which it did barely any damage. I then seeked revenge a few more times, as i thought it may be a fluke of some sort... but nope, even my OP TSE weapons did nothing to him. Can't really compare fallout to terrorists in real life pal, it is a game that has code. Had i known this was an issue, then i wouldn't have engaged, as i will not in the future. What weapons can kill a pacifist level 156 in a couple of shots? Secondary to that, the same high damage output guy also took incremental damage input.
---
absolutely agree.  there is very little point in crafting armor/weapons aside from learning non-legenday mods.  obtaining god-like items from mobs that amount to little more than yard trash is absurd - especially when you can round up a large number of those mobs in one place and drop them in 2 seconds.
---
Reduce weight of those heavy weapons = now everyone is running around with missile launchers = no variety in what players are using.
---
I'm assuming the thought process was if you want to be a heavy weapons user, take the perks that reduce heavy weapon weight.   Specialize.  It always comes down to people wanting to do everything with one character.  Just my opinion, makes games bland, boring and predictable.  
---
Its genius...but still makes him a coward in my book
---
yea i think we got it 
---
they‚Äôre tryna tell us smthn 
---
My Enforcer would drool at the chance to cripple a Swanclaw.
---
Thats because this game is way less structured than other Fallout games. Try playing Fallout 4 or Fallout New Vegas then you get the exploring with actual NPCS and a story line with real end goals.
---
I use gun bashing to kill rad roaches and eye bots in situations I would kill myself shooting with a TSE. That's about it though.
---
it comes free with the ACME Deluxe Custom Lock Picker's International Guaranteed To Work Every Timer Or You Won't Get In pack.

It's in an unseen storage slot in the pipboy.

You are not alone, OP:
---
Scavenge. Repair. Repeat. That's it. That's all there is. I'm not gear grinding legendary drops in a post apocalyptic survival game. One, it kills the atmosphere. And two, many other games do gear grind better anyway.
---
Survival for it's own sake is neither compelling nor a goal to aspire to. This game needs more.
---
Wonder if you can double up then with Hunter,  and scorched receiver? 
---
Pocketed does add pouches to leather armor. Deep pocketed does not, for some reason.
---
do you mean over your armor? i thought it went over the armor, unless you mean just keep your armor showing 
---
What if I'm farming ammo because I'm getting ready to launch a nuke?
---
PvP guy says I can't do that unless I engage I PvP with him.

But......guess who wants to show up to my nuke zone and farm high level gear?

Is this where I put the current duping exploit? You know, the one that disconnects the whole server and ruins everything? Or do I do that via support ticket so it doesn't get everywhere?
---
They do need to get the server crashes under control. 
---
Sweeeet, thank you.

Didn't go over my armor.. When I put it on.. My armor came off

Division II does nothing for me. More bullet sponges and PVP endgame I dont need.

It would be nice for at least a few legendary versions, although I think a explosive one would be too OP 
---
Regular armour unless you have lots of perks that benefit an armourless build
---
you are being very dense here!
---
Because the stash limit is allegedly there to discourage hoarding of a lot of unique items and limit server load. I'm all in favor of increasing the stash limit - but what you are suggesting in no way gets around the core issue.
---
There was no thought process with Bethesda. They just didn‚Äôt think about how a 43 pound missile launcher and 2 pound missiles would make the gun completely ignored by its player base. I‚Äôve never even seen anyone even use a missile launcher and I‚Äôve been playing for 200 hours almost.
---
Not really. The hoarders just have an alt carrying 10000 pounds of garbage. Raise the stash by 200 you can store 4 big guns or 200 rippers, which honestly most people will have 200 more pounds of scrap and 50-60 more cosmetic outfits

You have every right to go to the workshop. It isn't off limits to you, like the nuke zone isn't off limits to him.

There‚Äôs only one way to combat this evil

*starts eating explosive bobbleheads*

I just started playing FO76 about a week ago and am only a level 9 so far. I have had zero experiences with griefers but I've had two people who were very generous. The first led me to a mailbox where he stored a TON of plans and recipes. The second was a few days later where someone led me to their camp and spent a solid 10 minutes giving me all kinds of random stuff, such as purified waters, ammo, weapons, plans, recipes, aluminum and other crafting items I desperately needed. I felt bad I had nothing to give in return but I thought it was a pretty awesome experience. I can't wait until I have progressed far enough to do the same to some newb (like I currently am) who is just trying to figure out what the hell to do.
---
If you try to capture a workshop the game warns you that you are entering PVP and gives you an opportunity to cancel.
---
This is exactly why I posted this. Thanks for sharing.

Amen! Need more unique bosses for sure!

Remove the name, because it's witch hunting. We aren't aloud to hunt witches here, even if they are asshole.

You only get it in one color. That's it. The hat is red, the fringed dress is white/cream, that's it. You can't recolor either one to make them match. So for $14, you get a dress and hat that should look great together, but they only come in one color each, and they look like shit together.
---
ooooooh, i used to have it but idk if it has an armor rating. i‚Äôd say it‚Äôs better to stick with your armor. and smthn else to go over it 
---
I'll build one for you. But I won't be one until later this evening. Let me know
---
&gt;Regular armour unless you have lots of perks that benefit an armourless build
---
If you are sneak build I would say yes.  No armor means you can carry more stuff.  
---
It‚Äôs not practical.  It involves a friend starting an alt and jumping straight into the Enclave questline.  You‚Äôll need to be their fast travel point and mercenary.  It‚Äôs the 2nd quest in the chain so between Bunker Buster and One of Us it‚Äôs a good 45 minutes of pain. 
---
Game is still Bethesda enough that it doesn‚Äôt care that you jump track and it even routes you backwards to the BOS questline after you enlist in the Enclave. 
---
Right, so you either cancel or go ahead. It was just reminding you that you are about to engage in PvP.

You just described the constant everyday bugs 76 has. I know full that all their games have major problems that I hate. But this 1 game has had more problems for me and any others I've talked to than oblivion fallout 3 skyrim combined fallout 4 became pretty buggy after I modded it to much but it was overly buggy also but fallout 76 still makes them seem polished.
---
I cant believe the open world is not more dynamic. Imagine what an Immersive Patrols and/or Conflict Zones mod could do for game...
---
It needs my dynamic stuff in the world space. Events are boring as hell. Same thing every time. Bad enough in Destiny 2, but here, too? Learn from bad design, dont emulate it.
---
YASSS! IT WORKS! Thank you so much!!
---
Sounds good. Thank you all for the feedback! 
---
Thanks, great info :)

That‚Äôs it! I‚Äôm getting me mallet!

It's called deep shrouded wood armor the plan is at riley Clay's bunker in the workshop area

What‚Äôs the difference between them all? I saw the plans for ‚Äúrevolver‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt say single action or western. Is there 3 different types??
---
someone in my server had a 10k cap bounty. no one tried killing him he was level 200. anyone who was able to get to the top where his camp was didn‚Äôt try to kill him they just started hanging out ?? 
---
I found that the further i explored in the beginning the more I died. I tried to do low level quests and event and started to slowly explore areas. I don't die hardly anymore so just keep that in mind. The PA thing was equally as frustrating since I was level 5 when I came up on my first PO. I had to drop the 45's and store them until i was leveled. Once I hit 25 and was able to wear all piece's i started to explore everywhere. Try also using your workbenches crafting items. 
---
It's the guy that keeps ganking people in the Division.
---
1k caps inst "Insane" as you put it :)
---
Any proof hes stacking bobble heads?
---
You mentioned serious Sam and I can‚Äôt think you enough for knowing that glorious piece of history
---
Honestly, after level 50, give us an addition SPECIAL point every say, 10 levels, maybe even 20/25.  A level 325 shouldnt have the same amount of special points that a level 50 does.
---
Theres just...not much point to focusing on leveling at this point.
---
 Just stay in sneak and you'll be fine.
---
Care to inform me?
---
It has a mod called 'Shrouded' which decreases weight to under a pound, improves stealth, and increases your sneak speed by 15%.  Full suit your armor weight comes in at about 1.5lbs, you're practically invisible to enemies, and you have 75% improved sneak speed.  The fact that Chameleon is extremely common on wooden armor helps too.
---
i found a screwdriver in one of them,
---
once 
---
Thats pretty neat
---
I.AM.JEALOUS.
---
The game is worth 30 bucks, are you joking
---
If the content the provided had a shred of truth or had a actual basis in reality. Not just "heard it from a friend on reddit". Then yeah I probably wouldn't be annoyed. Also I don't just look up people bashing the game. I try to find regular fallout 76 videos and all I find is the same copy and pasted trash from the same 5 youtubers. I didn't name any names or anything. It just bugs me.
---
I saw Grahm once, from a distance, and ran because he was a level 50 supermutant and I was still in the Forest.  This was beta, and my wee dweller had yet to cross into double digits.
---
I wish there was a better way of finding him.  :&lt;
---
No still low just had to delete items
---
I volunteer for the XBOX group 
---
I jump server looking for a challenge i wana find a lvl 150 or a team of players holding a workshop i would love that challenge. Sometimes i do and the pvp is good but this is unfortunately rare to find. If your low lvl take a workshops with a group. You know it is a pvp area so dont be dumb. Put all dropable items in your stash box periodically so you dont loose your loot.
---
I agree about separate servers. I just think they should also remove workshops from PvE servers then, as it would otherwise be unbalanced without any competition. 
---
You basically already can do that. Just craft a new core and toss your old one away.
---
If say it's probably possible to do a MoM build for most things aside from like fighting scorchbeasts etc. Put perks into sneaky things, pistols and single handed weapons and the buffs for having no armour. I'm going to give it a go at some point I reckon 
---
get rad spong and play with him a bit
---
I'd really like to know how atoms are selling. I think they are far too expensive, and should probably be halved in value. I might actually be inclined to purchase some from time to time if they were reasonably priced.
---
yeah but the point of the room was too be able to test them on the live servers and stress test the net code. Why would you expect it not to be in the game,
---
Already made up my mind: no more money for Creation Engine games. Either get with the times, or get put of the race. I'm not supporting mediocrity any longer.
---
Do you by any chance horde notes and holo tapes? My friend flat out refuses to get rid of them and constantly has to drop them and pick them back up to complete activities involving terminals and I also suspect it affects his stability in the server.
---
One of the marketing/event coordinators is from WV. Many bottom/middle rung employees from WV but not higher.
---
Lead Artist toured the state for months and took public tours.
---
Source:
---
Am from WV. Attended the Greenbrier media event. I asked EVERYONE about who had WV ties.
---
Not saying the above is absolutely, exhaustively accurate. Am saying I went searching as a journalist and that‚Äôs what I found.
---
50 Cal hunting rifle mod should be way more powerful. I don't get why it wouldn't be. Being able to craft like a hundred rounds each time it great tho
---
Someone never played Fallout 2 ...
---
I don't think workshops need the same protection as camps.
---
A lot of grief would probably be avoided if camps were cheaper to repair. Repairing a decon shower should not require flux for example. Crops shouldn't cost more to repair than they do to replant.
---
Fusion core processors make one at 100% every 7.5 minutes. Poseidon has 1 I think Thunder mountain has 3. Weighing 3 pounds, having 20 total is more than enough in my opinion. PA would be OP if it didn't consume some sort of resource, or require perks to not consume so much. I'm at the point where I don't pick them up from loot unless they're above 75.
---
I honestly don't see the current state as that much of a problem.
---
And you're being extremely dense as I'm saying that the inability to store anything useful as compared to 6000 unique costumes should be addressed over having more weight added. It's not meant to address the core issue. It's to make the stash useful for more than just storing more junk and costumes
---
If you want someone to turn there mic on send them a message directly...
---
I'm sure the intended the nukes to not be so easy, but they are fighting against the internet and the need to not run off solo players.
---
The issue is, I believe, the fact that some gamers just want some casual fun and do not really want to feel the hardcore wasteland, while the others want a deadly wasteland when you never know how an interaction will end, and we're both forced to coexist in one sphere, which I don't think is rewarding to any sides in that conflict.
---
The truth is that its just a game and if you are not willing to participate in some of its aspects you should be able to do so. Also truth is that as long as you are risking something, the interactions are rewarding, but if you are not under any risk then the interactions are dull.
---
I do believe that once PvP servers come out, most of PvPers will leave the current servers as boring dull shitholes (not trying to be offensive here). The very essence of traversing wasteland is that you never know, and if you play against computer enemies, at some point you know it all, and the only way to still have any reasons to be cautious is to be under constant risk from other intelligent beings.
---
Endgame of this game are other players. I want the game to let express that properly. I want unrestricted PvP servers where I can freerly do my stuff without having the possibility of being trolled by some pacifist shithead that attacks me without actually attacking (i.e. obstructs the aim all the time, attacks my camp while being 0 caps etc), and being unable to shoot such troll. 
---
Because Bethesda is a lazy, low effort copycat design studio these days.
---
I could've sworn that was all confirmed by a rep a while ago.
---
I always took that one as a drug deal that went bad- there's always chems around the vault dweller and that other skeevy lookin' guy is sitting across from her.
---
Please!!!
---
You‚Äôre arguing about balance and player tendencies.  I‚Äôm talking about something becoming literally impossible under the current rules.
---
I'm quite familiar with the Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant IRL and can say they did...an OK job with it. The statue itself outside is the most impressive piece of the work but the interior is all wrong. There's the walk-in area/the gift shop with the museum itself behind a door. The museum then has an additional room that always has the Mothman Prophecies playing (not saying it should in-game, but they could have had a defunct viewing room to be true to life). Seems liked they kind of had a wasted opportunity to do something cooler with the location, maybe have some Mothman swag to loot (the RL location is really more of glorified gift shop than anything so it'd be appropriate)  but yeah.
---
No clue heard from someone that heard from someone. Ha! Still well done no matter.
---
Make a separate post..dont forge to add [PC] in the title..ive played with a bunch of redditors [PS4] and had a blast..u can make a new post daily..just say looking for teammates now [PC]
---
Exactly my concern. Especially given the glacial pace of patches.
---
My two shot version has the damage Regen bug still. It sucks cause it does a lot of damage
---
Amen
---
My issue is that they are trickling out the store items. People spend their atoms on the best thing available now. Then more things are added they might like more, but they have no atoms. I think the psychology analysts at Bethesda think this drives new atom sales, but in reality, it just makes me give up on the store and only check it occasionally when my atom point gets high.
---
Bethesda, if you want me to spend a ton on the atom store:
---
\- Add everything from all of 2019 to be available now.
---
\- Drop atom prices by at least 75%.
---
If both of these were done, I would probably spend over a hundred bucks trying to collect many things from the store. The way things are priced and trickle-added to the store, I will probably move on to another game before I find anything worth dropping money on.
---
LOL. "Hell is other people."  
---
 I'm not a Raider, I don't attack anyone yet I spent 10 minutes or so at my CAMP with a couple shooting the shit after they scared another player away. His CAMP was beautiful and I was admiring it when this guy showed up and vaguely threatened the owner. He immediately bailed and  I cursed the evil bastard and invited him down to my CAMP.
---
 We need em' they make the game. Them and the Scorchbeast are my favorite parts of the game.  
---
Telling someone to not take workshops is dumb.  PVP at workshops should be at workshops, it shouldn't be selling a license to kill you.  Also a big part of this game is 'rebuilding the wasteland' and since the turrets and other defenses in this game are laughable against players OR creatures it makes the whole idea mute.  Once the idea of taking a workshop = making yourself a loot pinata becomes more widely spread it will result in the vast majority of folks ignoring yet another broken piece of this game.  It's players taking a design intent "hey if you take this someone else can try to take it from you but then you have to defend it if you want to keep it", into hey if you take this you are selling any dickwad a license to farm your ass because you didn't know or haven't had the chance to farm out and/or buy from dupers a tse shotgun and a full set of pvp armor to make you a pvp god (or even remotely competitive).    Sure TSE Explosive weapons are getting nerfed but until they do something to make it so that pvp boils down to who see's who first and can pull the trigger quicker, then pvp in this game will be stupid.  As long as people like you exploit badly designed game mechanics to annoy and frustrate other people then the fewer people you will have in the game to either farm or possibly get involved in actual balanced pvp if it ever becomes a thing.
---
You are really dumb, I mean who cares if 60 dollar is chump change 60 dollars is the regular price of high quality triple A games, this is definitely not the same as something like Fallout 4 or rdr 2.
---
I wonder if they changed the loot table. I used to get between 2 and 5 items including plans, armor pieces, etc. 
---
Since last update I've turned in over 40 plans and every single time I only got 1 Stim and some ammo, all the times.
---
At first thought maybe i already had all the other possible items on pool but then remembered I still miss the 2 higher ranks of BoS underarmor, and some BoS mods for combat armor pieces :/
---
But they turned me into a newt!
---
I can not downvote this irreverent comment enough. 
---
I now have to offer absolutely nothing useful, just to tell you that you offered absolutely nothing useful.
---
i'm going to upvote you even though i dont agree with you necessarily. I LOVED FO1 and FO2. I was horrified when i heard that FO3 was being released as a FPS, but i loved it too. I loved new vegas (although i was honestly overwhelmed by the zillions of ammo types and weapon mods) and i loved FO4. 
---
I look at it like mexican food. It has different combinations of flavors, different presentations, different shapes and forms, but to me, it's all basically the same thing and it's all delicious!
---
I honestly don't think i'd really want another isometric fallout, and while the new games dont capture everything i loved about the original Fallouts, it has enough for me. 
---
Like everything else, Fallout is growing and changing, sometimes it's not what we hope it would be but that's life. I play FO76, and i enjoy FO76. 
---
Someone being a hoarder should never be a concern for how they design the game. You can argue against that all you want, but no, a person's choice to hoard 200 rippers shouldn't be why they make choices on this game. 
---
people are already using alts to hoard. The thing is, they just want a system that allows them to do that easier. The easier it is to do, the more alts and mules people will make for the express reason of doing just this.
---
I don‚Äôt always have my ear to the ground but I don‚Äôt remember hearing anything directly addressing this.
---
Workshops are the PvP zones, plain and simple.
---
So many better games for strict skill based PVP shooting. Why even bother playing this, if you're playing for PVP?
---
Cheaters are usually called something like "IIIIIII0IIIII000IIIII" with different kind of I's(Lenght/width), so that they are hard to recognize.
---
Got a wanted state when opening the door in the upper floor in the Converted Munitions Factory. Appeared some where claiming the workshop while i was hacking the door to get my hands on the power armor. Later on i made a gesture "fire" and "come here". Took infinite before they knew what the plan was. Then when i died and the 30sec mark came, one revived me. So the process restarted because the wanted status was still on.
---
Fruit juice?
---
I shouldn't have to message someone to turn a mic on if they want to trade. A person shooting at me because they want to trade is just an invite for me to drop them right where they stand.

Reclamation Day‚Ä¶
---
I should be dead. I should have died 25 years ago, but instead I woke up in a stranger‚Äôs bed and headed out into the new unknown. Let me backtrack a bit‚Ä¶
---
I‚Äôm not a Vault Resident. I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I‚Äôm not qualified to re-build America. Sure, I went to VTU but I was never going to make it onto the Overseer track. My grades were never what you would call exceptional, even it high school. Barely passable is closer to the truth.
---
I barely made it into the Security program. I wasn‚Äôt a war hero like Chief. My greatest accomplishment while in the military? I survived as a Ground Pounder. No Power Armor, no fancy training, just pure, dumb luck (Devil‚Äôs Luck my Great-Gran would say).
---
If I‚Äôm being honest, I think the only reason I got into VTU was they had to meet a quota of local applicants as part of the deal when they bought out the old university. And you don‚Äôt get much more local than my family. We‚Äôve been roaming these hills nearly as long as people have been here (both sides of my family line if you believe the stories my Great-Gran used tell me as a kid).
---
Still didn‚Äôt get me in the Vault though. I owe Madison for that. If not for him, I‚Äôd have been one of those skeletons you probably didn‚Äôt give a second thought about on your way out of the Vault. Never cared for Madison before that day, now I owe him everything. Spoiled little rich kid freaked when the alert went out and wrapped his new Corvega round a tree trying to get to the Vault. Security inside was going to end up one short and I was the first ‚Äòqualified‚Äô alternate they ran across before the door closed.
---
So that gets you caught up on my story until Reclamation Day. Back to the start of this story‚Ä¶
---
For us in Security, the Ressies were always off limits. Suited me fine. I knew most of them before the bombs dropped and they never failed to remind me of my place (in their eyes) in the hierarchy. Most of their kids weren‚Äôt much different‚Ä¶ until R-Day.
---
Overseer (she‚Äôs a little high strung, but was always decent enough to me) throws a party the night before the door opens. The Ressies get plastered and we (Security) get to make sure they make it back to their rooms. I‚Äôll admit I had a bit much too drink as well, but I‚Äôve had a lot more time to practice functioning drunk (or worse). Last one I escorted back was one of the ‚ÄòVault Babies‚Äô. Maybe she had ‚Äòissues‚Äô, maybe she just didn‚Äôt want to be alone, maybe‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll never know why. She was gone by the time I woke up, off to make her mark on the Wasteland, her face little more than a hazy memory in my drunken brain.
---
The ‚Äòbots didn‚Äôt care that I wasn‚Äôt a Ressie‚Ä¶ If you had a Pip-Boy on your arm, and were on the inside, you belonged. They were basically handing out supplies to anyone that walked up. 
---
Managed to get past a couple of security locks on the Overseer‚Äôs terminal and find out what‚Äôs going on. 25 years of not much to do, you manage to pick up a few new tricks (even as an old dog), but even Chief couldn‚Äôt break the code-lock on the weapon cases.
---
I guess that‚Äôs enough for now. Time to head out and see what‚Äôs out there. Maybe I‚Äôll find her again, maybe my Devil‚Äôs Luck will finally run out, maybe‚Ä¶ a lot of things.
---
Oh, one last thing‚Ä¶
---
Jake : If you somehow ever see this. It was me. Well me and a couple others from Security. You did your best to make ours jobs hell, investigating every little thing you considered a slight or offense and reminding us how you were always smarter and better than the rest of us. It never dawned on you that we had monitors and override codes. Consider the Nuka-Cherry stash you lost as compensation for putting up with your shit for 25 years, you stupid sonuva‚Ä¶ 
---
Y'know there are people out there who aren't you, right?
---
Subnautica had something similar with the large/small battery charger. Took forever for them to charge back up as well which helped balance it out. Pretty high up in the tech tree and rare mats to craft. 
---
What about Barkspawn?!
---
Clutch anyone? Robot lords of destruction... 
---
it wouldn‚Äôt let me exit once, and when i was button spamming i bought an outfit then it finally let me back to the main menu. &gt;:(

Hmmm...It's very possible.. the game takes place AFTER the T's were designed.. conspiracy theory!
---
&gt;... not some shit out of 1950s leave it to beaver land.
---
(Who's going to tell him?)
---
Oh no! My immersion! 
---
Lol, that is funny though. 
---
sometimes I like to make fun of Fallout 4's ability to sell water for large amounts of caps by going up to houses and asking if they are interested in some fine quality water
---
I‚Äôve stayed there a few times with my in laws. The place is pretty interesting because everything there seems like it belongs in the 70s/early 80s. The crazy bright carpet colors and the restaurant named after Jerry West (NBA player). They have a old fashioned tea time around 4pm, where people all go drink tea and eat little snacks and socialize. 
---
The area around it (a few miles away) looks like total economic devastation. Just a really poor area.
---
Absolutely beautiful scenery though.
---
This is awesome. I can see Bethesda sharing this on social media or using it for marketing purposes. Love the matching picture poses. This is the best post I've seen on this sub yet!
---
Yes and if you're on PC: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/129
---
What? He said "I wouldn't even mind if I had to load it with something like flux". Crafting a core only costs one of each so it's not like the cost could be lower for just a recharge. I was just pointing out that it's pointless to want to recharge a core one time if it's going to cost flux.
---
Well? Did you find an 3* legendaries?
---
yeah because the game had time to get fixed. something everyone is FORGETTING when they say "Obsidian is better than Bethesda. Look at Fallout 76". FO76 is 3 months old.
---
Your 'toon is on the cloud servers, but your photos are local. So uninstalling everyhting and all data and reinstalling from the store will wipe your photos.
---
I did the same thing around that level. Renewed my joy for the game, except I wore the Faschnact Man mask and played horror sounds through my mic. Usually only did the first 30 secs of jump scare, then I'd change out of costume and drop them items (if they stuck around).
---
The creepiest mask IMHO is in a basement in a particular Mothman worshipping town...
---
They could make you defend it more often if they think it's too easy or raise the cap price to claim the workshop.
---
It just seems like forcing someone to engage in PvP isn't fun.
---
When I was still a sub 50 character I once spent my last 25 caps to claim a station because I desperately needed oil. Literally 5 minutes after I claimed it a higher level player came and started trashing it and I was forced to switch servers and abandon my last 25 caps and that pretty much ruined my entire gaming session. That was a toxic gaming experience and I did not enjoy it at all.
---
There are three power plants, each one has a FC processor.  It works out to a core every 2.5 minutes.

Confirmed! Many thanks - game stable once again :)

Wait until the game loads more to open your inventory
---
That's very cool, OP!  Here are some fun facts about the Greenbrier I recalled from an episode of Ancient Aliens.  I thought it was pretty interesting how the government paid the Greenbrier lease payments for the underground bunker and in case it was activated.  
---
From on the Greenbrier history pages:
---
&gt; The Greenbrier served as a WWII military hospital that admitted 24,148 patients, and at the height of the Cold War a top secret U.S. government relocation facility for Congress was built on property, securing The Greenbrier‚Äôs place in history.    
---
&gt; On May 31, 1992, *The Washington Post* published an article which exposed the facility. As a direct result, the U.S. government began de-commissioning The Bunker and ended the lease agreement with The Greenbrier in 1995.¬†

When was the last time you played?  It's actually significantly more stable than it has been.  I haven't had a crash or disconnect in over a week.  I'd say they have been and are continuing to improve stability.  Watching this subreddit since launch is evidence of that.  The front page is no longer filled with cries of help asking for stability.  It's filled with what people want to see in the game because stability isn't really an issue for them any longer.
---
Found this comment in response to someone asking about this weeks:
---
&gt; Yes. It will likely be available Thursday. Thanks!

Its pretty fun seeing the panic when they realize whats happening.  It incredibly fun and a decent way to make caps if your bounty isnt ridiculously high and you win most.   I either get swarmed by 5 people right off the bat or not a single person shows up.  
---
pretty sure the NCR doesn't even exist yet in the timeline.
---
No but if you know they want to trade then you still don't need the mic as you already know.
---
&gt;not your cup of tea
---
You're right. I like games that at least mostly function properly.
---
&gt;not valid criticisms
---
Despite an overwhelming amount of support and legitimate evidence supporting these criticisms.
---
&gt;They're the same tired lines that people here are really tired of rolling their eyes at because they've actually played the game.
---
There's literally hours of footage supporting how messed up the game is, from many different sources. Many of which have sank dozens of hours into the game to try and provide an honest and true review.
---
If you all are tired of hearing about it, why not demand Bethesda make some actual improvements? How about not blindingly supporting a wet hot dumpster fire of a game behind a containment subreddit and demand you get what you paid for? 
---
So you're on old age welfare and your time has literally no value outside of punching in another day - or a stupid kid.  I know where my money is.
---
This. At lower levels, I'd keep tons of juices and teas on me bc they replenished a little lest thirst but always had other benefits and weight less than boiled water. 
---
But as I got further in, juice just seemed to help less and less. Now that I've got my industrial water purifiers running, I basically have 20 cans or more on me at a time that give probably double what the boiled water gave me. 
---
Now I only make cranberry juice when I come back from a Scorchbeast Queen fight, and that's assuming I saw any between Watoga and the nuke zone. Sometimes I don't see any until they're already Blast Berries. And I don't even know why I pick those up, aside from one time someone in a Youtube video I can't remember said "cranberries" a funny way and now I just hear it anytime I see them.
---
tl;dr Boiled water used to be okay, juice and tea were awesome, now I drink nothing but purified water and making juices is just a waste of time bc they restore less than half the thirst and pure water is stupidly easy to get.
---
Not sure
---
I have no problem with people not like this game. It is just annoying when all the people making these types of videos and comments actually don't play or have not played enough to form a real opinion of their own.
---
Might be wrong timing.
---
I done stuff like this container bags you name it , never had this happen 
---
They are the end game creatures and you thought you could insta kill them as soon as you hit "max" level, with what i can only assume is an unoptimized build and gear/weapons.
---
Go figure it was spongey. If you aren't using the proper perks or have an explosive gun they are tanky. Rifles especially are poor, they rely on sneak attacks mostly. Try grabbing a shotgun and equipping the enforcer perk and shoot its wings. And try Fireproof in endurance to greatly reduce the sonic blast damage. 
---
Just cause everyone thinks the game is easy doesn't mean it is if you aren't optimized, like any mmo type game.
---
"aside from notes and terminals and some quests, no lore" ... so you're ignoring ALL of the game's lore.

I got two mosquito bites on my chest. 
---
Love it :)
---
But you need some kind of roofing, at least i would, have a SB visiting me at least once or twiste a week :)
---
and WE NEED A BoS flag :D
---
i didn't say it was meant to address the core issue. I said it did not circumvent the core issue and therefore is a nonsensical suggestion as far as bethesda are concerned.
---
I had one for a while out in watoga, wish I had the forethought of pics. It didn't use foundations just the tall concrete walls and barricades that encircled the green build area.It was on a road so I still had flat surfaces for all the stations. It was a pain to upkeep though with all the enemies that would spawn. I also hadn't realized I built it with a roadside event so it would get way trashed some days.  Thus I have a nice trading post now and my RP BoS guy hasn't decided on a home yet but will be more traditional in style. 
---
I think it's just down to server stability I wouldn't worry about it. 
---
What if it‚Äôs fat people you eat....could be high in cholesterol at the minimum......
---
ok, I must have been thinking about uranium deposits at Thunder mountain, sorry. I feel that a single "session" dedicated to farming cores gets you more than enough at 100%
---
it's still early days, i'm betting we will get more end game content sooner rather than later. 
---
I've heard nothing but great things about the new spiderman game so i got it for my daughter for Christmas. She played it and loved it and raves about how great a game it is but she put in about 20 hours. She beat it in a weekend. I don't think it's possible to do everything in 20 hours in FO76, and the fact that you can do everything and know that there's more coming seems pretty good to me. 
---
If Bethesda marketing reposts this, all I demand is an interview for a junior marketing role in return! I work in advertising and working in the video game space is a dream role for me. 
---
You didn't have to engage in the literal only PvP mechanism in the entire game. 
---
I think it's possibly just a coincidence purely as I dropped a fair bit of stuff for a friend and randoms and didn't get disconnected. 
---
I used to, now I just have the holos for quests that won't drop. 
---
Or have all mobs scale to each player's level, with appropriate loot tables. 
---
On xbox and I'm guessing ps4, if you just tap left trigger a few times from 25k it will reduce down to zero without going over.  It's a shitty work around but works until they fix it.
---
shit, not me. I think someone needs to play some Fallout 3
---
Sneak to gun runners
---
Buy grenades and sniper rifle
---
Kill deathclaws
---
Level up
---
Rest for 24 hours 
---
Repeat last three steps
---
Omg this is amazing!!!!!
---
Might steal this build. Been playing with stairs they really are they way to get a building where you need it.
---
Pc, sorry I'll edit post
---
But you're right though. Scorchbeasts are a major pain in the butt. I usually avoid them.
---
I wholeheartly agree.
---
Does sneaking actually hide bounties on the map?
---
We‚Äôre still in the vault, running a simulation to get our skills up before actually being released. 
---
Crazy idea, but you can avoid this by just not cheating in the first place, a.k.a. duping.
---
&gt; fisher prime  
---
Well, boys, it looks like we have a name for the nuke boss of The Mire, lads.
---
No, a simulation.
---
The dog particle 
---
We do this all the time after whitesprings or SBQ runs, me and friends dump all the legendaries or useless ultracite plans in a container, and watch as people coalesce to scavenge it.
---
I think it was just bad timing.
---
Nah that doesn't make u an idiot...just means ur willing to play or forgot to turn it back on...I've never had to fix a weapon or dump while in that event because I'm smart enough to take 2 guns and not carry 300 lbs of crap into it...common sense really
---
Most veggies can be made into juice.
---
Melon, tato, blackberries,etc.  Others can be made int soup. 
---
All cooked foods use boiled water which is lying around everywhere. 
---
In my experience every kitchen has 2-3 of them. Most places with a way to cook actually has some lying around.
---
If you played during the beta that one wont mark as done unless you start a new character. 
---
Hmm, deal breaker. 
---
*Sky Shark
---
How many times have you heard the team "one shot" in reference to PVP? I think if you removed the cheaters, people would have much less of a problem with it.
---
I'mma have to stop you right there real quick. I've been playing since the beta, and I have noticed the game being less stable. You don't even get a "controls disabled" message anymore, you just crash.
---
I have literally never seen a single piece of Legendary laser weaponry... Up until this comment, i seriously thought it was just another one of those items that dont have any available drops. (Scout armor, and previously hunting rifles)
---
Beta character? What happens in beta, stays in beta. 
---
Thank you for sharing this üòä
---
I got around (if not specifically) 200 more added to my max carry weight with the full set at level 45.
---
It kills.murgle ;_;
---
For me some issues have gotten a little better, but most of the time it bring other issues with it. It has gotten better than launch day for me.
---
Yeah it is. You haven't played it.
---
perhaps, but most people go into an event thinking you can‚Äôt hurt each other cause of an event. not a lot of people think someone is dumb enough to place their camp and leave it there. 
---
only seen a few people have helpful camps, like another user commented, which hopefully prompts people to turn on pacifist 
---
I'm saying with a change like this, don't increase the weight. Base the stash on how the items will interact with the stability not on an arbitrary weight value. Example: World of Warcraft has item slots over weight values, different items stack in different amounts to manage space. We're already based on weight, but if we want to store an item we rarely use, such as a heavy weapon that weighs 30 pounds, it takes up 1/20 of the stash. Even if the stash treated it as 10 pounds, as it does with an entire PA, it'd work better. As it stands nobody can really store a heavy weapon for later.
---
Although, I think I may have picked the rocket powered roller skates or giant slingshot
---
At least read the post before trying to Shit on the OP. 
---
This has to be one of my favorite FO76 posts. I would love to see other players IRL posts.
---
This is really cool, thanks for posting
---
Ah I see, thanks.
---
Felt like I time traveled reading that title
---
With the latest patch, after a fresh restart of the game, loading in can get a little funky.  Sometimes you load in, and you can move, but don't do anything menu related.  like open the pip boy.  Give it 30secs or so, then attempt it.  It's only happened to me a couple of times, but it always loads in eventually.  Are you getting the double loading screens when it happens?
---
That‚Äôs usually what I do after I beat a game. It gives me a reason to keep playing. 
---
Take Dead Island 1. I loved it, it was fun. After I beat the heck out of that game I would literally look for players (via in game menu) who were just starting. I‚Äôd show up and role play as Banoi‚Äôs very own tour guide (as the four available characters were vacationing/partying/etc), I‚Äôd lead them to areas and tell ghost stories and conclude with simple spoiler free clues like, ‚Äúand that‚Äôs where the serial killer lived, ya know they never found his special machete, do you think it‚Äôs in there? I‚Äôm not going to find out!‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôd lead them to rare weapons or skulls, I did it so much I knew where the invisible lines were that triggered a cutscene. Made a lot of friends that way. 
---
Good times.  
---
Guess I have to make a second character...
---
Nope.  They are selling a license to kill.  Go onto a server.  Find a workshop that is owned.  Find where that owned workshop owner is located (doing a quest, looting a place, sitting in their camp).  Go to workshop click on the workbench, fast travel to where they are, use vats and TSE weapon of choice.  Get caps and/or junk.  Hide, wait for them to come back, repeat.  If they don‚Äôt come back find where they went.  Kill them again, repeatedly as much as you want.  Until they wise up and block you then change servers.  There is no zone around the workshop where pvp is enabled.  In fact if they completely block off the workbench then you will either need to pick a lock (and get wanted flag), destroy the wall of defense (and get a wanted flag), then click the workbench but now everyone on the server can kill you and you can only attack the workshop owner.  
---
How do you know they don't play it. I have my opinion after 300 + hours it's no different than the YouTubers you say don't play it. I'm personally waiting on more content. Quest are boring now and farming has become boring.
---
Personally i wouldn't want it on my vats build. The audio cue is bad enough.
---
They both trigger alot.
---
Realistically, how do you expect them to fix that?  And besides, when in a life or death fight, there's nothing wrong with shooting someone in the back of the head. That's actually the best way since they'll probably not be able to fight back.  The one time I got Wanted for not knowing picking a lock would cause it I just went into the wilderness and hung out for a while until it went away.
---
Jayne: I‚Äôll kill a man in a fair fight, or if I think he‚Äôs gonna start a fair fight‚Ä¶ If he bothers me, or if there‚Äôs a woman‚Ä¶ Or if I‚Äôm gettin‚Äô paid. Mostly only when I‚Äôm gettin‚Äô paid.
---
&gt;	never nude option
---
There are dozens of us!
---
By turning in up to 50+ u mean 50 stacks or 50 tries?
---
I really don‚Äôt like how when you try to give someone something for 0 caps you can scroll past 0 to 25000.  Whenever I accidentally do this I have to exit out of the item and approach 0 really slowly so I don‚Äôt overshoot it. I think this is super annoying and I miss how it was before the recent patch. 
---
I'd be happy if people just took their mic off when they're using the can, eating, having a conversation with someone else in their living room, or berating their kids.
---
Well here ya go [pal.](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af6kei/_/edw2m98/?context=1) again not possible at least not for the reasons you believe. What we have here is a massive lack of understanding on what triggers pvp. Aren‚Äôt you curious how there has never been ONE video of someone doing what you claim? Despite the fact that all platforms allow for easy video clips of recent gameplay and the only videos we DO have prove against it?
---
I think I saw ammo in one of them once, but there was also an ammo box next to it that also had ammo, which made me think that it was just coded wrong, and it was supposed to be one of the common double-ammo boxes. 
---
Just wait.
---
Actually this kind of thing hurts us all that play the game. It encourages cheating and duping. 
---
I wouldn't complain if it was a helpful camp...but the intentions here were bad for sure.
---
Because all of the suggestions for this game are supposed to be bug fixes, right?
---
I mean, it doesn't really bother me, but might be something small that could have been added in.. maybe the first screwdriver you pick up, becomes bound in the misc tab and weighs almost nothing. 
---
i dont get this mindset. If you are a Fallout fan then why not play it? it's cheap as hell now, not like it's going to break the bank to pick it up for $20 (or less). If you play it and don't like it, cool. That's your thing. But to come here and say it's terrible when you havent tried it is just ignorant. It's like my toddler who loves french Fries but wont take a bite of a tator tot because it looks different. 
---
I love that you did the poses and everything!
---
That golf club though. I'd be looking around for ghouls - it's PERFECT! A+ detail work, Bethesda world design team!
---
So let me clue you in, when you're in the inventory, dealing with a vendor or trading with a buddy, you really can't see much around you. Therefore you can't tell easily someone is wanting to trade. So the bright idea they have is that they will shoot you to get their attention. See the problem there? Get a mic and actually say "would you like to trade?" Get it now? 
---
as a step son, having a step dad like this is awesome! definitely made me the person i am today. glad yours is great too!
---
I'd like to know that too. And if this magical additive exists for every meal or drink we make, then *why don't we put it in the water we're boiling to begin with?* It makes sense that boiled water we find out in the world might be slightly contaminated, sitting out there in the open and all, but if the stuff we cook isn't radioactive, then why is the water we boil still irradiated?
---
i can‚Äôt argue with that, i do agree
---
PS. I think it would be cool of you could mark yourself as lootable aside from a wanted level. Maybe show up as a blue or green marker on compass and map? Then you could mark items from your STASH and inventory to randomly drop if they kill you.
---
I guess you could carry specific junk items for rewards. 
---
You could also use events for time limits to be killed and pick a lock to get a wanted level before going to the event area.
---
A mini PVP zone with a boss enemy!
---
First, they need to fix the way FCs are selected when you run out.  I want the system to use the lowest power FC you have to reload your power armor.
---
Try using and exploding plasma gattling with the beam splitter. Thanks to mutations and my jetpack I can now finally live my dream of becoming an ac-130. 
---
I might do that eventually... but I have a few friends who are playing F76 and I bought it to play with them. I really didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be playing it much solo, but I‚Äôm enjoying it and want Ronald progress.
---
Oh yea got that right. Its happens every time I log in. Double loading screens too.
---
Needs more robots.
---
Maybe he just smashed a camp built outside of whitesprings golf club... and if so, I commend him for it.
---
tries. The loot drops are apparently random, and it can take a while for the good stuff. Some people said they got the BOS paints after 5 tries, and I've seen others claim they are over 20 with nothing to show except stimpacks and random ammo
---
Yeah for the most part the disconnects are just an annoyance for me but today I had claimed the workshop at Poseidon and was cranking out Fusion Cores when I decided to also harvest Uranium, aluminum and Lead ... just about the time I was ready to harvest the second production run ... disconnected ... I know it‚Äôs not a lot of resources but it still gripes me.
---
This sounds awesome! A+ idea.
---
The bottom line is this. You just want ways to hoard more. You picked up a game that requires you to have to choose what you keep and what you don't. 
---
One of the core design ideas behind the game, is that you must choose what you keep and what you don't. 
---
You want to get around that. 
---
To try and make your point, you are exaggerating things. Like 6,000 unique costumes. There's not that many unique costumes. Not even 10% of that is accurate. You've made mention of 200 rippers. Why would someone want 200 rippers.
---
And your response will be, Im exaggerating to make a point. Well here's the thing with exaggerating. if you can't make your point without such extreme exaggerations, then your point is wrong. 
---
They will increase the stash limit. It will be as simple as increasing the weight. 
---
Your suggestion is clearly self serving. You want to be able to store all sorts of heavy things for some reason you aren't being honest about. 
---
One problem. If too many people play the game with this idea going, there eventually won't be anywhere to build a CAMP at all. If this were to be implemented at all, I assume it'd be limited to private servers, where there is going to be a limited number of people with access to it.
---
Make that 21 good sir! And I‚Äôll have the pink castle bed! üòÅ
---
I was wandering near Vault 76 to drop off some extra plans and recipes for newcomers. Had a level 3 follow me around a bit, and he kept tagging me with the machete. I thought he was trying to pick a fight, but maybe it was his way of communicating with the outside world. I typically don‚Äôt like the mic chatter, but may have to go that route.
---
Wait you trying to tell me workshops was ment for pve only? Oh hmmm then why was we given the option to take workshops?  Your ridiculous really. If you don't wana be griefed then stay away from workshops or wait until your higher lvl or take the workshops with a team but still understand that there is a risk involved and that workshops is a pvp area. I bet you that type of child that will play on a pvp server then cry about getting killed.
---
I feel like 15-20 minutes is a bit extreme. I have been playing since Beta so I know how the game needs a few minutes to load. This isn't that, something is wrong.
---
I've heard Monongah is one of the best now, assuming you get ghouls. 
---
Also works as a can opener, since those aren't around either. Had a helluva time with my first can of dog food....
---
Well, I hope you learned your lesson. be nicer to Bethesda or pay the price. 
---
Because they wouldn't work in an online game, or whatever tripe BS spews.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt happen to be the lvl 60 something I walked in on blowing someone up in white springs would you?
---
You were button spamming. How about using patience next time.
---
I read through your document, and, mostly, what I think is that it sounds well-thought-out, but it's clearly not what Bethesda wants to do. I don't know whether they put some asshat in charge whose "vision" is PVP that you can only escape by DCing or whether they really think that this is the way to make money on a multiplayer game, but the thing that they clearly do not want, above all things, is the ability of any player to just opt out.
---
Dumb question but was it an actual robot or just security personnel?
---
Player base is going down that‚Äôs why 
---
I just don't get why people decided a violent action is a good way to get someone's attention. Everything has consequences. 
---
Use a lot of Soot Flowers, Wild Mutfruit and Herbs to cut down on the fat and punch up the flavour.  It also helps cutting down on the salt.
---
damn, I have not seen him in some 40 levels. I wish there was a way to find his location. Maybe even make him a fast travel location. 
---
What I'm referring to is a new bug, if I open my pip boy before my camp spawns in for example, it will freeze my game except for the map.
---
15-20 minutes is definitely another issue.
---
Like the idea! Not sure when I‚Äôll be online next though..
---
Ok and how to do this on PC?
---
It was a security guard who almost certainly would not have been entertained by a photo request. 
---
Sure and people like you dont want them to fix it or make it better when no mans sky flopped you all yelled at them to stop but no they turned around and made it into an amazing game and now all the negative reviews are invalid.
---
I get double loading screens every time. The behavior is definitely new but it is interesting what you describe though since it is similar to whats happening with me, it just needs a lot more than 30 seconds. Like it just sits forever. I have only got it to recover once and it took like 15-20 minutes.
---
I was a die-hard "duping and carry weight" cause of the crashes but it seems to have gotten noticeably worse. Luckily I always play with 2-3 friends so even if i drop i can join back up quickly. Then 75% of the time i'm invisible besides my nametag
---
Nice. That definitely can free up one or two extra points to redistribute in my build.
---
You are 100% right that that is a valid 3rd option, I've done that before 
---
of course I open this at work...
---
didn‚Äôt think i had to mention how i waited before resorting to spamming. and considering i was spamming the only buttons to exit. not enter or space or e. 
---
That is because you are not connected to the server yet.   The music is on the server not the client, That is why it is synced for players on the same server 
---
Home is where the meat is!
---
Lol no. I'm 110 sniper in brotherhood scientist outfit with medical goggles. 
---
Right.
---
But there is no 'only PvE' mechanism.
---
You still continue to selectively ignore my original point that you would be pissed if you were locked out of nuke zones because you volunteered to play PvP. It's the whole reason that Bethesda avoided separate servers.
---
PvP is broken they can't get enough people to volunteer so they need to force it on people. Now you have a dozen unused workshops sitting around because nobody wants to PvP.
---
And you are stupid if you asume all people play the same way as you... 
---
Ok we didnt want ya around either gtfo griefer.
---
i did nothing to them..now i got a funky nurse outfit 
---
Frankfort, Germany to DC was just under $1k US including travel insurance and 1 layover in Istanbul. This was going on 4 years ago. West Virginia isn't far from DC.
---
So answer me this...with pacifist on...if u shoot someone base, do u get a bounty? I never bothered to check lol. Isnt pacifist only related to pvp....not camps? 
---
Because I can have pacifist on but someone can destroy my base so ...
---
I mean... I actually quite like most of the stuff on the Atomic Shop.
---
Ever since Fallout 3 I've wanted desperately to decorate my own post apocalyptic shack in a way that mixes atomic age style with slapped together steel, kinda like the pre-War decor for the Megaton shack. Biggest disappointment for me in New Vegas was the lack of decorative options in the Lucky 38, which might sound petty, but I have very few problems with NV, so it's not hard to pick a big one. Fallout 4's settlement system probably saved that game for me, since after my first playthrough, the story got boring (until Nuka-World came out and I found my true calling). Now 76 is... Trying its best to expand upon that. It's also less forced. You can have a perfect CAMP without any walls or defense. Unlike 4, where at least one settlement was mandatory no matter what.
---
I'm enjoying mixing spikes and skulls and scrap metal with mid-century modern fireplaces, lamps and chairs. The aesthetic of Fallout is one of the selling points for me tbh.
---
Besides, I REALLY don't want to have to pay for cool faction stuff. Like... REALLY. Mind you, I don't buy Atoms anyway, I just save up. I get them for such silly things that I was able to save up 500 in about two days?
---
Tl;dr: your frustration is valid, I'm simply offering up my feelings on the matter.
---
 What an asshole you are! 
---
 You know nothing much and have demonstrated that rather well. You are not good at the game we play, and are taking that out on someone who is.
---
Same here. So much so I made my base similar to his. Once I get Rocket launcher perk I'm bringing mine to town.
---
Ok, ya sounds the same save for the fact mine never recovers or the one time it did took 15-20 minutes. I was thinking maybe whatever happened while I had my bag open and was killed that made my gun disappear maybe corrupted my character. I did just now finally get support to escalate me so hopefully they can figure out what happened.
---
The way the damage formula works, AA is a flat damage increase except in the case where your damage number is far higher than the resistance. 50% armor reduction = +29% damage.
---
The radioactive water is kind of questionable in itself from what I've read on the science.
---
As boiling goes, to my understanding, you'd end up actually making it worse, by adjusting it to be an even more concentrated amount of deuterium.
---
This happened to me once when the atom shop showed up when i tried to click on social fortunetly it only cost me 50 atoms to get out but was still bothered by it
---
I think you can just move your camp to avoid repairing everything.
---
Good luck! Hopefully it's something fixable
---
Skimmed the doc; Raider Mode sounds like something I'd play a lot. Faction PvP could be either really great, or really awful. I feel like non-Responder factions should get something really fucking awesome just so not everyone runs around as a Responder all the time.
---
Seriously though, this is really nice. Kudos, dude!
---
You won't get an argument from me that PvP is broken. I don't think this was their intention for PvP, from the original E3 clips. But the backlash about PvP made them neuter the system, and now we have this abortion of a system.
---
Also, you aren't locked out of anything. I don't know why you think you are. Like another user mentioned, there's been times where you can claim a workshop and farm for hours before anyone shows up. Then you just pack up and leave. 
---
I have personally witnessed a player taking more than 50% off the SBQ in a single shot on 2 separate battles, the only good thing I could say about it was that they were considerate of others by waiting about 5 minutes between the 2 shots.
---
You cannot harm another player or their camp or workshop with pacifist on.  That is all and exactly what pacifist does.
---
it‚Äôs related to camps, workshops, pvp. if u shoot at another player or anything theirs, no penalty. give in mind they can kill you though if u own a workshop, and especially if you‚Äôre on a team and your team mate doesn‚Äôt have pacifist mode. it aggros the whole team. not fair in my opinion. but nope, no bounty for shooting a players camps while pacifist 
---
 No. My mistake, I was not paying enough attention.
---
Or you know, alt-tab out of it and reboot the application. 
---
The bug is materials in your inventory vs materials in your stash.  Usually just storing all junk in your stash makes it work.  
---
I respect that, but, what do you mean by "the audio cue is bad enough"?
---
I was expecting a whole city of them, with Baker Deathclaws, and Banker Deathclaws... even a college for claw murdering techniques. 
---
All I got was a single Deathclaw who could‚Äôve benefited from being in that community..
---
Herd mentality at its finest
---
That's acronym is brilliant. Also love this idea!
---
Genetics I think, my father was serious and his father before him.  Anyway it was more burp and slurp last night, than sucking.  They must pay for their murdering behaviour.  I'm off to join the Raiders, no more mister nice Enclave fascist for me.
---
I have no opinion about Barkspawn because I've never played Dragon Age. 
---
yes, but do i really wanna do that? it‚Äôs not frozen. and hey, i made it back to where i needed to be. now i got a wack nurse outfit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
Sounds like the rules you had to follow in kindergarden. Jesus, go play farmville if you don't want any player to player conflict in an online game where violence, looting, raping, pillaging, and such are one of the biggest themes.
---
Just paranoia
---
Your username is very self-aware. :)
---
I think we will get mote special points eventually. This is just a soft cap until the first dlc. Many games do this kind of thing. That said, we still need passive perks.
---
different experiences then I guess.  I played starting a few weeks after launch(XB1X).  I would be DCed every hour or so, or hard crash.  Once the duping got wide spread it was way worse.  Now, I may disconnect once a week, but haven't had a hard crash since the latest update.  I played this entire weekend in 4+ hour sessions and had zero issues, even dropped 3 nukes at once.  Most of my problems would occur during SBQ runs, but that is stable as hell now.  No loot or corpse disappearing problems for me since the last patch.
---
This is exactly what I experienced. It was really frustrating. 
---
Wendigos on horses? are you freaking nuts?!
---
It isn't just low levels though, even high level players with no understanding of the fight can easily tank it. And I am sure a moderate number of high levels with good load outs and strategy could take her down even with extra baggage.
---
I was at a queen fight at level 60 or so, no PA, using an explosive 10mmSMG and Shotgun with enforcer perk. There was like 15 level 100-200+ PA users all hunkered in the reinforced base camp. Only one of them occasionally came out to assist me and none of the others even bothered to attack all the spawned adds leaving me to deal with them all.
---
The queen flew around 95% of the time because she couldn't land where they all were. The few times she did land, presumably because she finally became aware of me as a target, no one else came out to help so she ran straight over and killed me. I spent over 4000 rounds and died about 5 times trying to get her attention while warding off her hordes and they all left when it reached the 20 min mark and she was only at 80% as it was pointless to even continue.
---
If they were all out in the field with me she would be on the ground most of the time and could be beaten down easily. If they had come out to help deal with the adds I could have landed enforcer on her more often and made her attacks far weaker.
---
I have been to several queen were she wouldn't land often and failed but at least people were out of cover and clearing adds, this one however was just embarrassing to be a part of, even if I was the better part.
---
In the mean time...
---
Hmm perhaps at face value I'd like to keep a legendary heavy weapon and not have to keep it on hand. I've sold some of my coolest drops because I'm rifleman and can't afford the space to even keep anything cool that isn't a semi auto rifle. I have to hope anything cool I'd like to keep and play around with later has 90% weight so I don't have to get rid of it. Why else would I make a suggestion like this?
---
Makes sense. Anyway, very cool stuff!
---
holding us hostage, smh 
---
I'm just finding it hard to believe there was that many players with pac off...I'm gonna test this for myself tonight. 
---
As someone who has construction going on around the house, you don‚Äôt want me to turn my mic on lol. But shooting people to get attention is dumb. I just shoot the ground, click the pip boy light. Works pretty good. 
---
I don‚Äôt do the trade thing as it‚Äôs just awkward and I‚Äôm more of a gifted vs trader anyhows. Brown bag it is. Lol. 
---
You would also have to make it so the "bounty hunters" are able to be fired upon first as well. As it is bounty hunters have zero risk to tracking a "supposedly" dangerous fugitive.
---
Not true in my experience granted I've been apart of two instances where it was used
---
That's not true. 
---
What you really are saying is people can't store all kinds of heavy weapons for later. And that's how it should be. 
---
Also your argument is this. We hardly use heavy weapons. 
---
There for the system should be changed so we can store more heavy weapons, because we can't store that many right now. 
---
So we need to be able to store more heavy weapons that we rarely use?
---
By your logic, why would we need to be able to store more of something we rarely use?
---
Or it could be solved by NOT buying a game that you wont like, because it includes an element that you hate, just because you love the franchise and one of their games was your favourite ever. 
---
&gt;nothing about the game that requires you to play with other people
---
Really? The entire game forces you to play with other people, literally everyone here is complaining about that exact fact. If I want to take over your base or blow up your fusion generator, you have no choice unless you want to server hop.. that is requiring you to play with other people mate. 
---
&gt;You can literally do the entirety of the game solo
---
Except the events, workshops, bountys.. and likely a lot of the future content. Even now the Scorched Earth event recommends 4-8 players? So it obviously isn't supposed to be played solo, as much as the fanboys/girls want to.
---
&gt;This all could be solved with pvp and pve servers, like literally every other online RPG has.
---
Make the game boring, the whole point was to make something a little different.. it's actually quite sad to see.
---
FO76 released as multiplayer for a reason. It needs balancing, stability/bug fixes and quality of life updates. Splitting the servers will reduce the player base and split communities and groups of friends, even letting people turn off PVP instead of a half arsed pacifist mode would be better than split servers. Right now, PVP is actually rare considering how much people complain about it on Reddit and barely worth the time and caps. They should be creating more ways and things involving PVP if they want to retain those players, because right now they're clearly bored and blowing up peoples bases.
---
Yeah I guess that's a good question. The same goes for accidentally shooting other players when teaming up against mobs. I guess it would be nice to receive a warning prompt like you get when accidentally (or purposefully) shooting a player before they give you "Wanted" status on the second or third shot. Also, should crops even be destroyable with gun shots? I'm pretty sure a stray .308 wouldn't destroy an entire crop of razorgrain.
---
They may be introducing different server rooms soon where you can go to your own safe server without risk of this happening.
---
Better yet, deequip it when it's low and create an ultracite fusion core.
---
I just want more paint customizations for my power armor.  I missed out on that black paint for the power armor and am hoping they bring it back.  Oh and name tags for our power armors would be nice too...
---
You're just a hoarder. That's all. Get over it. 
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
You never see him if you settle in Watoga 
---
Whaaaaat you mean to tell me nerfing loot drops every patch and having no meaningful endgame besides attempt to farm sbq is causing the player base to drop? No way!
---
Ofcourse 
---
He's right dude. I think you are too busy being defensive to re-read your convo and see that.
---
Yeah I'm willing to cope with disconnects and crashes if I can RECONNECT and try to salvage my hard work. The random server selection breaks that. I can't imagine it would be that difficult to implement but it would also be evidence to us when it's a server crash on THEIR end, which they may be hesitant to acknowledge.
---
Does seem like it‚Äôs gotten worse though could be just experiencing it personally more often. I have faith that they‚Äôll get it sorted out but when I see old glitches from the beta come back it‚Äôs worrisome. 
---
Last played yesterday.  Rarely can I go more than 30-40 minutes without a crash to the dashboard.   You‚Äôll get the bzzzzzzzzzzzz sound and then you‚Äôre off to the XB1 dashboard.  It‚Äôs particularly bad after nuking something.   I nuked the other day solo and promptly got kicked about 5 minutes into the nuke.  I nuked with a team the next day and got kicked about 3-4 times in an hour.   If you nuke and you‚Äôre not on a team, you‚Äôre pretty much screwed.  You‚Äôll likely be kicked and you can‚Äôt get back into same world unless you‚Äôre on a team and they‚Äôre still in the world.  A few times our entire team has been kicked at the same, so none of us could get back into the world.  
---
From my perspective stability got worse after the last patch.   I‚Äôm either crashing or experiencing weird glitches/bugs with more regularity.  Yesterday for example vats would not work at all for a time.   (I use it to identify targets sometimes)  I had to quit  and restart the game  twice before it started functioning normally again.   I‚Äôve spent more time loading this game than any game I can recall.   Not only do you have to restart a lot, but when you do it takes quite a bit of time to load in.  
---
I like the game, appreciate the gameplay and I‚Äôm generally thankful for their efforts.  I‚Äôd just like to see a more stable platform before they start worrying about adding things or fundamentally changing gameplay.    Give me 3-4 hours of gameplay without a crash and I‚Äôll be happy.   This is an extremely low expectation for a console game but I‚Äôd be happy with it.   I‚Äôm crashing at between 1-2 times an hour in a non-nuked world and easily 4 or more times an hour in a nuked world.   
---
A newt?
---
We all know you can craft a core. Im gonna guess he wasnt like "Hell, ill use all the materials needed to craft one at 100%, to instead fully charge one from 35%. Seems reasonable." 
---
I figured, as you should have, that he was suggesting it would require less in some way. Maybe 1 of any type, or 1 of any type per 20%, to refill the charge.
---
So... You are not going to go to a.pvp server, because only people like you would be there.  Congrats?
---
I too went to Camden Park as a child,  me and my wife actually sent back over the summer for a fallout atm since locals organized. Its incredible how well they've done with some of these places. The mothman statue is awesome in Point Pleasant I go to the festival every year! 
---
what a stan
---
Button spamming never helps, people use it as an excuse for buying things digitally, it can delete items at mama dolces, and it sure as hell doesn't work better than pressing the button a couple of times.
---
Just close and re open the game if it's stuck, don't mash the confirm button on a shop screen.
---
Well, concept art is for an entirely different purpose....
---
I'm a hoarder because I had to sell my fun ghoul slayer's Gatling gun that I would like to take to white springs but I carry around a 3* ripper that only weighs .26 and someone might want to buy? 
---
Ack, sorry I wasn't able to yesterday, but I am available today if you are! My PSN is MandyMarieB. Just let me know when is good for you. :)
---
sometimes the legendary is at the very bottom of her loot list. Scroll down and double check. But yeah, she's not very rewarding... 
---
What is the range of camp artillery?  I am guessing it is not nearly what is was in FO4.
---
That could be. I‚Äôve seen some lonely nights on some servers in the past. Though it seems like there is a steady population since the holidays. 
---
Geeze just read some of your posts.  Your one to talk about grammar.  Haven't you heard of commas and full stops.  Your sentence construction is childlike at best.  Maybe English isn't your first language if so I understand completely.
---
I could kill him
---
I can right now 
---
That‚Äôs how it should be :)
---
As a super casual player, and 9-10ish (not even to the airport yet), I keep hearing melee is best build, and baseball bats are king. That true? And if so, where can I find a bat?
---
ok here is how you do it.
---
place the stairs case frame.
---
at the top of the stairs place a full floor piece.
---
now at the side of the floor piece, place a metal beam then another on top of that beam.
---
Now erase the bottom beam and floor leaving only the top beam floating in the air.
---
Now you can place another stair frame on top of the other as the floating beam acts like an anchor.
---
Only problem, floors attached to the top stairs will be considered floating so once placed cannot be stored or erased which is a pain. Make sure you know exactly the floor plan you want, you have to move the whole camp to reset at this point.
---
hope this helps
---
I don't mind PvP.  I haven't cracked 50 yet, and I kind of suck at it.   I've been griefed a couple times, but its the exception, not the norm.   Had my camp wrecked.  Part of the thrill in this game is running into other players and not knowing if they're going to be dicks or not.  My lowbie crew and I try to control a string of workshops when we're on together, for plans, xp, and really....just something to do.  We've run off other players a few times, and on other occasions, got run off ourselves.  First time we tried to take an owned workshop it was a complete shitshow disaster for us.  That 4+ person, 500+ collective lvl group with all the good mutations, tse's etc. can have the fucking workshop.  Maybe someday I'll find all that cool shit too.
---
Far be it from me to tell you how to enjoy the game, but as one player to another, you're missing out.  It's not constant, and it adds a little spice to the game.   If we do go pvp servers, I'm going to give them a try, even though it's far from my key focus for playing 76.  Unless it degenerates into a cesspool, I'll likely stay pvp.  
---
PvP is an afterthought.  
---
I'm confused, where did you end up finding the excavator calibrated shocks?  You say all the places you didn't find it, hahaha, I don't usually go to the Welch station or the red rocket in the Ash zone.  I will start if that's where you found them... 
---
cool, but last thing i want to resort to is force closing the game, considering it fucks with my computer. rather not have to go through that extra stuff if, in the end, got to where i needed to be. 
---
Build a wall around and completely enclose the workshop bench if possible. Someone wanting to contest it would have to destroy the walls first before they could activate the bench to contest your ownership. Since they haven't challenged the workshop yet, attacking the walls should put a bounty on them, which would then lure in other players to collect said bounty.  The bounty-hunters would thus be defending your workshop for you, so to speak.
---
They also disproved the bobbleheads stacking. It works in pve but not pvp
---
Please run around the map voice spamming everyone that there is a settlement in need of your help.
---
Alt tabbing and closing a program shouldn't mess with your computer, if so then you just need a new computer.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I have a bunch of ammo, armor,  guns, and chems but I have a hard time finding someone who doesn‚Äôt run off. I‚Äôm only a level 35 but my stash is at capacity. I found a level 7 in Flatwoods the other day who I dropped some stimpacks, radaway, radx, ammo and some small high damage guns they could actually use. 
---
And on the flip side, I had a legendary middle launcher and a bunch of missiles I dropped for a level 80-something player and he cussed me out and ran off without even looking at the stuff. If anyone wants a bunker buster, I‚Äôll trade you for some .45 ammo. 
---
just curious, which xbox do you have
---
Lol I mean if you don't mind seeing pictures about Dead by Daylight and my car then go on ahead haha.  I made the separate account so people wouldn't have to see my other stuff üòÇ
---
i would say it‚Äôs meant more for fast melee weapons
---
Right, so now i am thinking maybe he targetted me by taking over my workshop before engaging with me? Though, his name wasn't red to me originally and he only became wanted after killing me first time? 
---
Yea, i think more people complain about pixelly odds etc since games have to follow code. Real life doesn't have code to follow, it is infinite variables of every possible outcome. 
---
As the OP stated PvP is a nuisance in this game.
---
The fact that we need to go back and forth about workshops forcing PvP on players says it all.
---
At the end of the day everyone wants to go to a nuke zone and farm high level gear but by the signs of all the empty work shops..... hardly anyone wants to PvP.
---
Bethesda, I will buy anything this person markets for you.
---
They also may be trying to get you off the vendor so they can use it, im not disagreeing with you just providing a possible second motive
---
I didn‚Äôt see him at all until I was level 45. And then I saw him three times within a week, and each time right outside of my house, right next to the overseers camp. 
---
Bobbleheads were proven and tested to not kill in pvp through slap damage. It effects pve but not pvp.
---
Yea definitely double triple checked. Seems like it sometimes don't drop legendaries
---
nah, my baby is fine. it‚Äôs the game, and it‚Äôs shitty launcher. speak for yourself. 
---
This almost never works out this way in online open world games.  The winning mindset is KOS.
---
I'm currently in the middle cabin and I wouldn't suggest using cabin to the north, the is a recurring super mutant spawn and depending on your level they can be pretty high spawn. My only complaint about it is them spawning because they always attack me/my camp every time I load in.
---
On PC there is a mod that lets you see aggregate inventory weight, but it only works on character inventory. I periodically transfer everything  from stash to myself, and then sort there. Found a lot of inert flux, irradiated blood, Plasma/Fusion cores, ammo, and bulk steel taking up space. 
---
sure np.
---
Yeah at least you tried it.
---
And the game is finally where it should have been at launch. Maybe check it out again?
---
Ronnie the popular said it was a communist plot
---
Every time the crit bar fills it does an audio cue.  4 leaf clover triggering does it quite alot.
---
I don't believe grim reaper sprint has an audio cue though.
---
It comes out of your cornhole
---
Oh god, it‚Äôs THAT guy again. 
---
Thanks to marsupial, the deathclaw and wendigo just stared at me while I was on the roof. 
---
I would say more often than not, you are right. BUT, when you do find it and it works out with you and another player, it creates some of the best moments in games. It *feels real* in a way that it currently doesn't. 
---
Absolutely! I will sign on now.
---
imagine when they add 1x1 CAMP elevators! that will allow making CAmps in weird place a lot of fun.
---
I never said Obsidian is better than Bethes for 76 alone. NV easily beats out 3 just because of iron sights (and an actual story). 4 only beats NV in terms of gameplay, mainly being refined. FO76 still has time to prove itself, but it can't even hold a torch to NV story.
---
Why do you think Fallout 2 is the "best"?
---
Almost heaven, West Virginia
---
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah Valley Airport
---
i disagree. Legendaries should feel special. If they are craftable, they just become mods. 
---
Wholesome
---
I can grab you a few when I get home tonight. I've had my camp here for a while now, pretty nice location.
---
I love the "Fallout location in real life" threads.  I was wondering when we'd start to see some for WV.  Good job!
---
I just mentioned that, since there isn't currently a great way of getting rid of your fusion cores, except for tossing them on the ground. I was going along the lines of the OP's topic, and supporting the fusion core recharger. I get what you are saying though. 
---
My question in this scenerio for pve why would you need to drop your junk on death it seems like a mute point.
---
Seems like a better solution than mashing the keyboard and hoping to get what you want.
---
No I agree with you on that but I don't stay on the vendor long. Sell my 200 caps and move away. I have seen people afk at vendors though. 
---
Thank you! Crazy dog people need to stick together! lol
---
Yea, I have been in queen fights where there are lots of folks around with optimized builds and she goes down like the flappy winged punk she is.  I've also been in fights where half the folks hide in the shack and she never dies...  I will say though I haven't seen her one shot yet but I'm sure that is just a matter of time.  Under two minutes isn't a big thing though.  There is a guy who soloed her in about that amount of time on a server he had to himself with a non-legendary gun with a crit build.  Because her hit points scale based on the number of people attacking her, if there is only one and you have the right build you can totally solo her (though that requires you to be on a server by yourself which is uber rare).
---
I don't normally PvP.... But....
---
Fun fact, my flight home to Chicago was delayed 7 and a half hours and I was trapped in the Shenandoah Valley "Airport" (one room, one gate) for 8 hours. There was one unisex bathroom, no vending machines or food, and no TSA so they denied us the pizza the airline promised because they couldn't screen it. BUT TOTALLY WORTH THE TRIP!!
---
I kill wanted players to help them out, and if they are a low level, say 35 or less, I drop an extra bag of goodies for them next to theirs. but when killing a high level Wanted Griefer, I take all their junk and leave behind some spoiled Meat.
---
20k fuel? Sweet that's a good 45 seconds worth of flamer fuel. ü§£
---
I wish I was there to wipe the shit eating grin off his face.
---
They usually run away as soon as I climb somewhere. You must be lucky. :(
---
Melee is very powerful, I prefer my instigating  super sledge, it one hits most things and because of mutations I actually have -1 strength. One of my friends has an account where he only uses a baseball bat,baseball grenades, and wears the baseball outfit and he does really well.
---
I find baseball bats off scorched and the locker room of Morgantown high school spawns them. 
---

---
I was on a team where the kid I was playing with decided to start shooting some guys too close to his camp. Little did I know it turned pacifist off for the both of us. If the team leader or teammate wants to initiate that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else wants dragged in. Especially when I didn‚Äôt even notice any warning it was turned off if there even was one. 
---
Ah, the good ol' prison tuck and stuff
---
Those people have clearly never played Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel...
---
You don't understand, they've worked very hard to kill you, it wouldn't be fair - if they can't be the asshole bully they want to be: everything is for them, if you don't like it fight them.
---
If you have any more questions or just lonely in the game I'm on most nights and don't mind helping out. Add me if you'd like. Txcowboy69
---
I'd agree at this point because the RNG is intensely difficult. I been trying to get a 3 Star Trapper set with +25 Rad Resist, Weightless and Sneaking mainly and it's just impossible. It never drops (it's ultra rare that I even get 2-3 star items at all from 3 star enemies) and no one else ever has it either to trade and no in-game player stores to make looking for it from other players easier. Weight system encourages people to throw stuff out than trade it to players unless it's ultra meta. There's also no specific targets or locations for hunting specific types of armor/weapons. 
---
Making a specific Armor set is so unlikely that mine as well call it 100% impossible. After several hundred hours of playing + tracking the trading discord I've only found 1 piece that was even close to that. (Weightless Trapper, AP Speed, Sneaking). The odds of getting the specific combos I want are not gonna happen without letting us craft them.
---
I'm in the same boat as you, let me know if you hear back from them! Been 7 days since I emailed and ticketed with nothing back yet. 
---
You corrupted it by powering it down incorrectly. This could happen while playing any game or watching any movie, it sucks but not Bethesda's fault.
---
Until they allow private servers, this would be too easy to hack.
---
does it have any legendary stats? 
---
&gt; again made zero counter-argument
---
Counter argument against what? I said the previous games have **tons** of characters. You said this game does too. I asked who they are and you counted less than 10. You even included a character who doesn't even exist in the game (the overseer). What am I supposed to argue against? It's not even remotely comparable.
---
&gt; What defines this richness for you that doesn‚Äôt exist? 
---
Well meeting them for starters. The fact that they even exist in the actual game is another strong reason.
---
&gt; Is it your inability to seduce them or say stupid things to them?
---
Among other things, yes.
---
&gt; You don‚Äôt find a character that decides to buy into its own Hollywood personae to train orphans to be interesting? Or a woman that records her last days trying to hold it together until she realizes that the Scorched killed all her friends and no one is coming to be compelling? 
---
It depends. Do I get to meet these "characters", or are they just voice recordings?
---
&gt; Perhaps I should take from your repeating yourself that you refer to NPCs who continuously complain about the heat of the Mojave and wish for nuclear winter. Boy that was funny the first three dozen times wasn‚Äôt it? Really made for immersive gameplay huh? 
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw\_man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)
---
You know, Elite Dangerous has these sort of monthly community goals and events that are server-wide and affect the galaxy. I would LOVE to see something like that in this game, with lasting effects, such as building a town, purifying lakes, etc with changes to FAIL the goal as well.
---
PC here and seeing the same thing, well CTD's and no blue screens, but it's bad
---
It must be selective. I repaired a random generator at some no-name camp without any problem.
---
The dogs around the apartment I used to live in would go freaking nuts anytime he‚Äôd bark or whine. I kinda felt bad after a bit until I realized I had horrible neighbors.

Sure, let me just go in to my inventory tab and....*fast travels away*

I've found him following the main road up through the savage divide many times. The one that passes the pumpkin place
---
I got my foot in the door for my dream internship through Reddit (still at the same agency 5 years later) so if I also got my dream job through Reddit it would be lucky and amazing.
---
Nah, I'm not lucky. You just need to keep baiting them over to you by jumping down for a couple seconds, getting their attention, and then going back up. 
---
Same boat, what does your windows application error log report?
---
Will do üëç
---
The thing I really want to see is a combiner. Take your 92 charged one and maybe a 50 charge one you find and transfer 8 from the latter into the former.
---
That would be an awesome lore tie between games. As much as I wish Tabitha was in New Vegas, that took place in year 2281; we walk out of vault 76 in 2101. From her voice, I‚Äôm assuming Tabby‚Äôs between the ages of 17-30. This would make her a little old to run a radio station. 
---
Thank you for mentioning her though. I think Tabitha and Sofia are probably the most interesting characters (other than Mr Veterinarian) I‚Äôve come across. We‚Äôre introduced to them in the first town, so I don‚Äôt think many people were paying attention to them too much. 
---
I've been one shot killed while set passive. Walked into the monster mash thing without really understanding what it was. 
---
The guy one shot killed me. Then waited for me to retrieve my scrap, took the scrap, then one shot killed me again. 
---
I wish I had this problem, I would love gunning people down whom only wish to trade!
---
it usually lets me repair walls, plants, and generators, but i can‚Äôt repair workbenches or doors... 
---
You will cause high level spawns for the low level players. You'll need to help them with fighting if you take them outside of the Forrest.
---
...I got better...
---
I have one of those. It doesn‚Äôt even heal ghouls, just jitters their health a bit before killing them.
---
Doesn't have to be charisma based. Maybe they could give people a "Class Perk" that gives you a kind of active power like having a dog or being able to place turrets. 
---
Mics are less than 20 dollars in this day and age. If someone has a console and cant afford a mic, they don't deserve to trade.
---
Honestly, a lesser known mechanic that many aren‚Äôt familiar with and I believe may have been at play here is how people can abuse the workshop pvp system. Someone can in theory, hit claim on a workshop, purposefully not claim it for maximum abuse and repeated spam. Now they have triggered you for pvp likely without much warning if any. Not for me to say if it‚Äôs fair or not but most people don‚Äôt realize the full implications of workshops (myself included until recently)
---
I bet you it heals glowing ones and fixes their broken limbs.
---
Whole lotta pre-stimpackin' goin' on.
---
This would be nice. As it is now, when my core starts touching the E line on the gage, I hop out and manually switch my cores.
---
No. Was way up in the mountains. I *think* I either materialized in midair and fell to my death, though there were no nearby cliffs, or it was just assumed that I had died overnight of untreated rad worms. 
---
No I don't "get it" as you put it, because no one that's wants to trade with you is going to see your random post on reddit about it.
---
And no one on reddit really cares about you killing someone that wanted to trade with you either id have thought tbh.
---
You mean, you have nothing to do except grief other players because the grind had no reward.  With no real content from the game bring challenging, you're pulling the wings off of flies because you have nothing to do, but worked so hard you can't walk away.
---
Honestly not surprised by this. It only activates when you go there and it sometimes triggers right outside the front door or even quite a ways inside. On top of that a lot of people farm this event in order to get weapon blueprints which puts it on a cooldown. Honestly hope they fix vendor tables next update so its not this annoying...
---
Raiders for life
---
The major downside is if you‚Äôre above budget when it does this, you can‚Äôt run power lines.   Just build your base, but scrap what you don‚Äôt use.  Most likely when you scrap you‚Äôll go below budget.  Don‚Äôt use everything that it duplicated though or you‚Äôll be way over budget and not be able to run power.   As far as exploit, id think as long as you‚Äôre not hundreds of percent over budget you‚Äôll be good.  Exploiters will do this base duping glitch many times over and then scrap everything for materials.
---
I would like this even if their made only for camp defense I'd love them anyway. Besides we have fertilizer that spawns a Brahman so I'm sure it's not that hard to make a thing for them.
---
Probably the best non-spoon fed as a quest raid in the game. I tried to go there once and had way too much trouble. Took a friend of mine to try and power level and we could not get anywhere before he lost all his ammo.
---
I want to seek revenge but he's a bit traumatized.
---
Did you just agree with yourself 
---
30% more damage to ghouls, that‚Äôs like saying you can drown a fish 
---
You can repair them. Just walk up to them and you‚Äôll get the repair option if they‚Äôre broken. You cannot repair anything, even your own things that are damaged but not BROKEN. Health bar has to be all the way down.
---
What you can‚Äôt do is use the repair all option at someone else‚Äôs camp which is a bit awkward. No idea why Bethesda thought that was a good idea.
---
Sure, but if you had the ability to make it impossible to use an aimbot, rather than just hoping people don't hack that game, wouldn't that be better?
---
Lol thanks for that. So weird tho...
---
The coolest! Nice job with the comparisons too!
---
Don‚Äôt go into a high levels base.. without checking for traps....
---
Well break the 8 events into sets of two and you get 11111001.11001010.11001011.11011000 which as an IP is 249.202.203.216. I am tracking 249 as a Class C IP and classified as experimental by IANA. So not that...
---
I agree with you completely. In my original thread I mentioned reporting the player and the few responses I got were acting like I'm just a filthy casual  white knight and a loser for reporting stuff that's obviously not working as intended. But it's literally game breaking and ruins the experience for everyone. 
---
I'm not defending anything. I haven't played the game in weeks because I got tired of the bugs and lag. But that doesn't change my comment. You were cheating, the bug got fixed, and now you're unjustifiably mad. It's ironic people like you get angry over a buggy game until they fix something that you can exploit in your favor. Press F to laugh.
---
Pretty sure he was over encumbered by the sounds of it.
---
I find it a bit silly to shift the blame of a bad decision from the literal game developers to the "solo players". This version of pvp was supposed to be at launch, because it was decided on by the developers and was included at launch. 
---
I agree that we disagree.
---
I mean I‚Äôm not trying to be mean but I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre trolling me or not. You DO know monster mash is specifically a pvp event right?
---
Apparently you only get a notification if you tag in a comment so here you go u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
1. Scrap all the junk you find at workbenches, then toss it in your stash. (Junk is the only thing you lose when you die, but it's safe in your stash)
---
2. Take your time on the game, there's no rush and don't try to power level or play with high level people.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Would be helpful if they posted this themselves though instead of random posts from almost a week ago....Do they really have any clue what they are doing :(
---
Some items disappear completely because they don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúdestroyed state‚Äù and have to be repaired either with the repair all option by the camp owner or in the build option by the owner or anyone in their team.
---
You don't say.
---
;)
---
So the thing about scorchbeasts that makes them really annoying to kill is that they abuse every game mechanic possible, and honestly aren't that much tougher than other enemies on a basic level.
---
1. they fly, and this is a big one, because damage drop over distance savagely lowers your damage output against them, if you have a rifle with 200 range, and the scorchbeast is 600 Bethesda meters away you are dealing 1/4 damage (200/(200+600))
---
2. armor mitigation is based on damage done, so your 137 damage rifle, I'm going to round it to 150 and assume 150 damage resistance on the scorchbeast for math reasons, would be dealing half damage, same formula as range, BUT range applies first, and although I can't confirm for certain, it appears that the damage resistance stacks against your reduced damage, take the 1/4 from earlier and your damage drops to 37.5, which the armor reduces by 1/5 instead of 1/2, meaning damage drop off stacks insanely fast against them when they are flying.
---
3. their hitboxes are awful, their wings only have hitboxes from their shoulder to elbow, the rest takes no damage, combine this with their erratic movement and they are very hard to deal consistent damage to in the air, and crippling their wings without concentrated fire or some other perk that simply breaks their limb instantly is something of a pipe dream. Their head has a similar thing going on
---
4. visual audio interference, do I need to explain why their screaming is the worst
---
All this adds up to make them inordinately difficult to kill in the air. But the thing is, as soon as they land you can walk over and shoot them in the face point blank with impunity and they die in 30 seconds without any particular weapon, build, or strategy, I've killed them in less time with a pool que. Their only slightly tougher, if not, than a high end super mutant, and I would rate them less tanky than a behemoth or mirelurk queen, but those are huge, easy to shoot, and don't hang out as far from you as possible. Add to that the fact their melee and other ground attacks aren't that powerful, and you get a very annoying enemy that if the first thing they do when the spawn is land you don't have any issues, but if they decide not to it's absolute hell.
---
Did you play Fallout 4 or no?
---
I agree completely, it just takes a few minutes of work.  Once  the processors are running you can go do something else, just remember to empty then every 22 minutes.
---
You don't even need to power up the nuke plants, just drop a generator next to the processor.
---
Haven fun! There is a website or two for looking at perk cards if you want to sort of plan out how your character plays. Really you can just uses your first character as a test for what you think looks fun.
---
I want so badly to downvote this
---
Lol. I've pvpd maybe once in 100 hrs, in defense of my first base . Have not been attacked since I was level 8. Don't be a baby.
---
Confirm PS4.
---
This is why we should have dedicated PVP and PVE servers. I played on PVP WoW servers for years, then started on a PVE one with a friend. It was the best decision I made (not so much interested in world PVP), you can safely attack world bosses and not have to worry about getting ganked or accidentally damaged.
---
IIRC about two days ago someone posted a guide to how to do the same glitch without power armor using melee/VATS/marsupial.
---
I'm still building a secret dropping room of shame.
---
I think I was OK in that respect. Had just killed a behemoth who turned out to be about as tough as a mole rat. 
---
The frustrating thing was the instant enemies on the respawn. Seems like respawns out to place you a reasonable distance from anything that would want to immediately kill you. 
---
I‚Äôm not talking about user reviews, those mean nothing, people who don‚Äôt own the game or have never played it can review, it‚Äôs just endless fanboy wars. I‚Äôm talking about critic reviews...

If i wanna join me ill give u some gr8 starter gear n shit Bigdaddy011090 is my gt

There was actually a guy a couple of posts ago offering to help players on Xbox: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj2rjh/offering\_my\_services\_as\_a\_guide\_on\_xbox/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj2rjh/offering_my_services_as_a_guide_on_xbox/)
---
Thanks for the feedback! I agree that Bethesda's vision for PvP is a bit murky and needs refinement. It's just... I love this game, and I feel like it deserves a really cool, epic PvP system, not something half-cocked like we have right now or some lazy "Let's just segregate the population to different servers" nonsense.
---
There's a brotherhood reddit page for this. Look it up and they do this type of stuff and more. I think it's called /fo76brotherhood. We got around 350 ppl in it.
---
Your troll style is as flaccid as many things in your life, kid.  Go punch in, and pretend someone cares that being "good" at a game was the intent of this post.
---
Maybe some tato and carrots to add to the meal!.....
---
To be fair, someone did directly ask them in that thread so that is where they responded. But yeah, this isn't great communication on these things. I just hope this update has a bit more substance as I'm rapidly losing interest.
---
Seriously you comment on this in a week old thread but don't post about it yourself? 
---
Sorry to say this Jess but up your Community Manager Game!
---
I definitely think he may have had some legendary armor effects active too but unfortunately I didn't get to see his screen in the video. 
---
I am all for this but make everything viable.
---
I want flame throwesr, laser weapons, plasma weapons, pistols, etc to all be as usable and OP as everything else.  
---
I detest legendary weapons/armor, for a number of reasons but pertinent to this thread it's because it makes for tremendously unsatisfying PvP, which I was really looking forward to prior to Beta. 
---
what platform are you playing on ..if ps4.. i can help you with tough areas..also..if i see enemies in which i know i cannot handle..i literally go left or right to walk or run around them..do u know what is a great area to grind when at lower level? summersville..theres also a lot of good junk in the buildings..and the super mutants drop great loot..i think the highest there is a level 16..let me know if you have other questions..grinding is my thing
---
This is what you shouldn't do, it's gonna ruin your first impression of the game and everything will be too easy.
---
I only figured that myself recently too. They can repeat it too?! So essentially engaging me in pvp "without my consent" or authorisation on a repeat basis? I knew it happened once, but not multiple times... though now that makes sense. I think its a bit dodgy, as it tends to be lower end players that go for workshops normally, making it easier targets. I think beth need to take a look at that as well then.
---
Early game best to stick with melee build. Doesn't take ammo and is stupid strong. 
---
I "afk" at vendors on purpose with less than 20% hp. I do this to bait impatient assholes. They will shoot me or melee and try to be sneaky, but my armor prevents any damage while standing still. I am also immune to explosions, I will turn around slowly and shoot them point blank with my TSE lever action. Sometimes I will even have a 200+ cap bounty while doing this! Its a good way to farm people for caps!
---
In addition to the no bag dropped glitch, if a player is adding to a bag and another player removes the bag's last item prior to the item getting placed the newly dropped item ends up in the abyss.
---
Not sure that I saw that one when I read through.
---
*ding ding ding* We have a winner!
---
Only if the weapon has specific legendary effects. For example the Bessemer effect deals more damage the lower your damage resistance, which is what armor provides. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an effect that increases damage the more damage resistance you have though.
---
Mods are different from 3rd party software running in the background. Even Bethesda said that they won't ban players using mods.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll be on all day since it‚Äôs my day off!

Side note:  I can't wait until I discover the [Green Bank Telescope](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141010-radio-telescope-green-bank-west-virginia-astronomy/) in game.  I've only been there once IRL but it was awe-mazing.  I am hoping it's the same in game.
---
Think I'll go hunt down a large pot......
---
From what I‚Äôve seen they take different ammo types and different damage. 
---
I'm not how much, but it grants like +10 damage and energy resistance when at low health
---
The kid wants to go there for march break, and I'm already planning a stop there on the way home. He's really stoked to see the places in real life that are in his video game. 
---
Interesting, thanks for the response! I scrapped most all of the duplicates except a few extra walls to save wood and whatnot. However, when I was done building, I switched servers then the budget fixed itself. I scrapped everything I had stored but it does not tell me how ever the budget I am, only that my budget is full. Which makes me nervous to destroy anything as I will not be able to place it again with a full budget. 
---
I had a level 49 ask me for 20 caps to buy a plan, in return he gave me 8 stimpacks
---
I encountered this too. I have yet to be banned lol to avoid this I just store everything in my camp before I move 
---
You assume the person bought the console. What if it‚Äôs some kid playing? What if some adult bought it, and is going through a rough time cash wise?
---
Did you have Pacifist mode enabled?  I would think that should stop camp damage too.
---
Just a heads up, there's also a website called Xbox dvr, look you up your account and you can download any of your clips or pictures from Xbox right to your phone/PC
---
I just looked in my recent player list....his name was up top....sir tamagotchi...might have to troll a little today haha.
---
I have sooo many reports there on Fallout76 and I am not that familiar with browsing there or filtrering data in a good way. Will check with my friends if someone has more experience since I am lazy.
---
Regardless it is a mess and only in fallout....
---
yea, I'd be good with that too. Give the machine enough room for like 4 or 5 cores, and transfer the energy around.. scrap the empty cores into junk. I've literally dropped 50 or 60 on the ground so far in my play time for weight savings.. which may not happen as much, since they patched the cores refilling at log out/in. 
---
How exactly are we meant to be warned about who to look out for if we can‚Äôt be given their username?
---
Indeed I did, finished the game three times 
---
a week after the last patch i went from no issues pre-patch to 4-6 server crashes in 4 hrs post-patch. After that week though I haven't had any issues. My assumption is my issue had to deal with more the dupers.
---
This would be an event I would like to see if they ever gave is persistent servers.
---
Yea basically, if someone does this, since they‚Äôre not actually taking the workshop and you can‚Äôt just abandon it the only way to prevent grieving is to change servers. I agree that‚Äôs not in the spirit of what I believe the game should be either.
---
No this is generous gift
---
Whatever, it happened and shouldn't have happened.  Just because it doesn't align to your view that the game can do no wrong.  
---
If this happens to multiple people then it's a problem and needs to be fixed.  Last thing Bethesda wants is to lose customers, so OP reporting this gives a chance for other to reply.  At the end of the day everyone wants the game to be better. 
---
No need to be an ass to people reporting bugs they find.  I've just bought the PC version and have the Xbox version also.  I can comment on how awful the UI is to use on PC and how unresponsive it can be.
---
OP might be a one off case.  But on the chance it's not then wouldn't you prefer Bethesda to know so they can fix it? 
---
Yep there are about 5 or 6 affixes that are worth getting for min/max building. Besides that it's all just filler.
---
One would think the Raider would want that XD
---
They definitely made some bizarre choices, choices that guarantee there would be no semblance of balance in their game. How can any game with a competitive elements have guns and perk loadouts that do thousands of damage per shot, while also having legendary armor and stacking buffs that render a player literally invincible to damage from other players. Oh, let's throw some mutations in there that let people fuckin fly while we're at it. What a bungle.
---
You rode in a non fun having car! Still awesome though.
---
I do now. I didn't then. I just wandered in. 
---
I think I mentioned in my original post that all bets are off in PvP locations. I don't know what level I was when I made the mistake. I'm not a hard core gamer though. I tend just to wander around and explore, and I think that's what may have happened. 
---
I also have less than perfect vision. Can't read most of the handwritten notes and I miss most team invitations unless i'm looking for them. There was probably a warning that I overlooked. 
---
Make a second character if you plan on helping lower level people, otherwise enemies will scale to your level and it will ruin their experience with the game
---
Aww he's gonna LOVE it! Things are not as close together in real life as in the game, so definitely map it out beforehand. WV's tourism website has an [interactive map](https://wvtourism.com/fallout76/fallout76-interactive-map/) with all the "real world" locations of some of the major places in the game.
---
Weapon weight!!!!
---
Sometimes it seems like the amount to craft and repair some items is too high. I swear the excavator armor is made of screws and springs held together with black titanium instead of the other way around. Some things need balanced out slightly better. 
---
I just looked it up and it‚Äôs cool and everything, but like we‚Äôre looking to have it more uniformly on Xbox, and we‚Äôre not looking to just merge into someone else‚Äôs group like that
---
they get experience from the turrets defeating the ghouls for literally doing nothing..def not my style but i see this there a lot
---
Thank you for this! 
---
Echoing this as I just wiped and reinstalled fresh.  Only thing missing are the photos. 
---
It would be even cooler if it was made into a community event to rebuild the tracks and then players can use the trains to get around the map, but for that to happen players would have to have certain servers that they play on so they don‚Äôt do a huge progress on the train on one server and then they join another to have nothing built on it
---
Thanks for the response! This is a good idea, I'll have to stop being lazy with the relocate strategy
---
No.. Not really.. That ur opinion. But when i started its hard to get goin when ur new. So whats wrong with a fee stims and radways rad x and lether armor for a lvl 10 or less plus a starer gun n ammo. I dmt see nun wrong with that i see that as makin u prepared for the game.
---
&gt; they denied us the pizza the airline promised because they couldn't screen it.  
---
As a WV native living in Las Vegas, I'm proud too.  Despite all of the bugs and unforced errors from Bethesda, their art department did an excellent job of showing the good and the weird of WV.
---
Most of my family is from White Sulphur Springs and I've travelled most of WV. What's awesome is seeing some of my family's business in the game. 
---
That's what I was assuming
---
 You have never seen me in troll mode. I was simply replying to your stupid post. If you can't manage the game's junk well, you are not good at this game.
---
I came across an explosive beserkers .44 and when all my armor is off it wrecks face but I stick to my TSE 10mm for now.
---
Yeah, I used to work in building 5 on the capitol ground. Kinda disappointing that it only had the main complex in game. Kinda would have liked to go in it again.
---
Well yeah, i am seeing it more often which made me categorize it as "worse". I didn't have much issue til the past few weeks. Nukes definitely are sketchy. Haven't dropped my own but there is a decent chance to drop when someones detonates.
---
I have a sneaking suspicion that most of the disgruntled players are on pc, as I'm on ps4 and it sounds like we are playing completely different games! I've had so few pvp encounters that I forget it's even part of the game.
---
Yeah. I found a guy who would load up a med box in Flatwoods with goodies, and just sit back and blast it with a laser rifle until people came over out of curiosity. Then he‚Äôd cease fire, give a thumbs up, and back away and let people shop. I should try that next time I have donations.
---
Starched genes man. Starched genes.
---
You underestimate my determination.

Jesus that sucks! The poseidon workshops can be 30 mins of questing to get up and running. Then,  sorting workshop out with turrets, blockades, crafting stuff etc etc. Then, you finally kick back with an iced deezers lemonade, to get it taken away by a griefing prick, that doesn't actually want it! 
---
They can‚Äôt ban you for that, it‚Äôs their screw up. This was a common thing not long ago and led to a lot of players having duplicates they couldn‚Äôt place or scrap for several weeks while Bethesda took their time working out a fix, I couldn‚Äôt build the entire time.
---
If I were you I‚Äôd keep all that stuff.
---
That's pretty fucking tight work there.
---
yea, at level 107 and 150 hours in, I haven't left the vault OR hit level 10 lol. Working on a second character now
---
oh i do not doubt it
---
Yes. Without starched genes rank 2 radaway will remove it.
---
Starched genes shows up in the early 30s.
---
Btw trade with players. You can get 5-10 serums for the cost of 1 from the vendor. Even cheaper if you can provide the fluxes to craft the serums
---
I mean after 200 SBQ kills I gotta make my home on point!
---
If you do not have starched genes, any time you reduce your rad count, you risk losing your mutations - radaway or anything.
---
Serums are useful for two reasons:  
---
A. You get exactly the mutation you want.  
---
B. You don't suffer the negative side effects (of that specific mutation) for the first sixty minutes.
---
That's what serums do. They don't lock in mutations or anything like that.
---
There is only one TSA lane and only a few TSA agents, and because the airport is SO tiny, they really only come in when there's a flight. They're also furloughed right now and not getting paid, so there's no incentive for them to stick around. United had ordered the pizza but TSA told them unless they could be screened, they couldn't be brought in so United had to cancel the order and instead took all the plane snacks and set them out for us for free. I had like four packs of ginger cookies and some M&amp;M's for lunch/dinner.
---
Yeah, we're not gonna hit all the places as we are meeting up with family friend in ronoake (sp?) and then popping to blacksburg so he can see where his father grew up, but we for sure are hitting up the Greenbriar and from there, up in the air. We have 3 days. So he has to be very narrow in what he chooses.
---
Yes, taking radaway has a high chance of removing mutations.  If you have rank 2 starched genes however you will never lose a mutation nor gain a mutation from radiation.  This perk card is unlocked starting at lvl 30 and is in the luck category.
---
I can confirm on PS4.  Myself and 2 teammates have the issue.  Tap L2 5 times (might be 4 times) to get to 0.
---
I'd also add:
---
"Targeting HUD power arm helmet mod causing multiple crashes." May be isolated to just PS4 players, though, as that was the root cause of my troubles since the last patch.
---
The home defense perk?
---
Try confining the game to only a few cores by setting the CPU affinity. Also measure the ping/latency of your network connection, preferably towards the server the game connects to. Process Explorer can show the TCP connections Fallout76.exe has open so you can ping the relevant Amazon server(s). Anything above 16ms can cause noticeable hiccups as the main game loop is  tied to timely server response.
---
(For me, the issue is with loading hiccups, audio specifically, on a SATA 500MB/s SSD. Pretty frequently, the game suddenly loads about 90MB of audio data that causes a 200 millisecond hiccup at this speed. Even the GPU utilization chart shows the dip. For some reason, the game loads audio/resources in the render loop.)
---
Can you have multiple ones active?
---
Sweet, I‚Äôll be sure to check it out. I was enjoying my hunting rifle/10mm pistol combo but I can‚Äôt keep up with ammo lol
---
This picture is amazing, made me laugh; thanks for the share!
---
It was obviously just a lag issue.
---
Yeah, they do that
---
Just wow, thanks for sharing
---
That's what I like to see, you help someone after you need help in whatever way you can 
---
Yeah it will - maybe not the first time, but within a couple uses of radaway it'll go.  What you need is two levels of Starched Genes.  Level 1 makes it less likely to lose mutations, level 2 makes it so the mutations can't be lost by using radaway.  You also don't gain extra ones with the perk on, so if you bought more serums you need to remember to unequip that perk before taking them, then put it back after
---
Seeing the PvP justification for the removal for double-shot really rubbed me the wrong way.
---
Had like three stimsüòÇ need to hit up the enclave lol
---
Fallout 76 is set before the events in Fallout 4 so technically you‚Äôre just igniting the minutemen, not reigniting.
---
I agree with the echo chamber sentiment, anytime I talk about the pvp I do, I get downvoted into a bolivian
---
That was painful.
---
A player's first steps out of the vault are a huge part of the experience of this game, and really shouldn't be messed with. The game already gets easy at high levels, and is much more enjoyable when things are a challenge.
---
I know your intent is to be nice, but it actually often winds up being negative.
---
don't be afraid to just go exploring. the game has a lot to offer than people seem to think at first.
---
also, once you finish the quests available, i find setting my own goals helps keep me engaged in the game. Simple, personal things like crafting a stronger suit of power armor to replace my crappy level 25 suit and actually hunting the components in junkyards or office buildings instead of just buying them from vendors really keeps me coming back.
---
Pretty sure it's just a joke. Since every combination is different, whoever made it just made sure he wouldn't use the same 4 digits two times. The previous 2 "Destroy Robots" missions were 0/10 and 0/101. Still doesn't make sense.
---
Yeah, he was cool

Oh jinkies, I was only aware of the purifiers not deleting, sorry to hear that! I hope you're right, I poured some good time into making it. Thanks for the input!

For those interested in the bunker just do an image search for Greenbriar Bunker.  You'll see things like the [cafeteria](https://www.roadunraveled.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/greenbrier-lunch.jpg) and [one of the entrances](https://vandaleer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_1460.jpg).
---
Well you just happened to get extremely unlucky then. That‚Äôs the only pvp event in the game. Staying away from workshops (though you‚Äôd be fine 98% of the time, there‚Äôs always those just looking for trouble) will pretty much eliminate grieving. Only thing that you can‚Äôt avoid is someone destroying your base atm but hopefully that will be addressed one day.
---
Oh gotcha, well honestly if I could've picked one location in the game to visit it would've been the Whitesprings/Greenbrier, so it's a really solid choice!
---
"Revolver" is the Western Revolver and ".44" is the regular .44 revolver. The other two (pipe revolver and single action revolver) are more self-explanatory. The Western revolver is basically the better version of the .44 revolver, it does more damage than the .44, but I believe it has less available mods(I could be wrong about that though). The Single Action Revolver is the weakest of the 3 revolvers that use .44 ammo and only has one grip mod(which is a shame because it's the best looking imo). The pipe revolver, like most pipe weapons, has the most mods, but is the weakest and uses .45 ammo instead of .44, which is a lot more plentiful.
---
I like the corpses in the pic with the houses. Its definitely close to representing WV. Trust me. I have been there

Why would you want to pay when it's been a feature in the past two games. Geez, don't just fork over your money dude.

Damn, that's crazy they wouldn't allow a pizza in.

Glad you enjoyed your trip! Come back down sometime! The New River Gorge area is beautiful, particularly in autumn.

When you have a bounty you don't want, have a friend kill you and then you can sell them a bullet worth your bounty back to them. That's what my friends and I do when we accidentally get bounties, and it saves us all of our stuff.

Far too easy to exploit. Besides Bethesda would screw it up anyway tbh.
---
Would I be able to run more than 1 active?
---
I would love too!! Haha
---
Was walking one day when i noticed in my pipboy i was carrying 2k+ 'useless' 10mm ammo. Dropped it all to make some room. Then the next best weapon i picked up from a mutant, yup, submachine gun. Scrapped it.
---
Oh yea please! But as you already mentioned, tricky with all the servers since its not an MMO and server hopping not that great aswell... 
---
Fast traveling is kinda annoying for me but the map is too huge to walk by foot all the way. Trains would be the perfect balance for me haha :D
---
yes i have 8 mutations
---
I'd be pissed also if I spent real money and caps to get a bunch of duped weapons and armor so that I would be the OP king of the wasteland......only to find out that nobody even wants to PvP.
---
Lmao i wonder how many people would see me and would like to kill me
---
2 deaths since release.....Damn, must be very frustrating

I kind of am, but not THAT extreme. The scaling seems really off. Mostly everything is way higher, a few are way lower and only once in a while do I find something properly scaled. It was also going on 24 hours since slept and I was being a little irrational. 
---
All the jokes and quips aside, this is either an incredibly stupid decision, a mistake or maybe just another planed way to royally piss of the player base by making them, wait, wait, wait for Phoenix to not be busy killing his kin.

It the little things Bethesda!

On PS4? I could show you how to get them.

Fair doos, i should have seen this coming lmao

They did not allow photos of the bunker unfortunately. The space has been reused as a data storage and security facility so they can only do tours as long as they confiscate all phones/cameras. 
---
it's how mafia works

*your comment makes no sense*

A bounty board with some statistics would be nice. The rest is stupid because it sounds like you just want to hop servers and destroy some bases for free.

Awesome work!

Lol. Well I‚Äôm pretty sure whoever that was shares your sentiments. Fairly certain this is what happened cuz I noticed one dude spamming the trade emote before I walked in on him being murdered.

I did the same thing when one of them accidentally nicked a workshop. They were only level 6 or 7 but then started going at the turrets. More importantly, the attacked the junk extractor AND I NEEDED SCREWS &amp; SPRINGS. So they were mercifully dispatched and I filled their bag full of useful items.  
---
I also put in all my spoiled meat just because.

And mafia sucks.

Drag it over to some other scorchbeasts and make this one watch you kill its brothers and sisters before you end it‚Äôs disgusting, filthy, miserable life.
---
I hate scorchbeasts.
---
Enough already had to order Dominos... 
---
I think it wouldn't be more than a few minutes before someone figured out how to packet shape outgoing traffic and tell the remote server that they picked up 100 bobbleheads instead of one
---
Sure it's not Bethesda's fault that there is a bug that fills  your camp budget to 1188%, the game can't handle this amount, freeze completely, so that not even the power button holding thing is working and the only way is to powering it down incorrectly.
---
Than this game will fit like a glove for you. The biggest difference is you *need* to scrap your junk in this game. It will save on weight. Adhesive and aluminum are still premium items in this game, but you'll need to add screws and springs to the always hoard list. Every work bench in the world is connected, so you can craft and repair anywhere and not just at your camp (settlement). Energy weapons in this game aren't the greatest, so it's best to avoid them early on. 
---
And I think you can only acquire one per server per day... My problem is did they put me back in the same server or not 
---
Yea I was pretty mad. Wanted to mess with people

So you get a double dose of ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what it would look like if a nuke dropped on where I live‚Äù
---
Are you on PS4? I've helped at least 20 people get it and I'm willing to do it one more time for a story like that.
---
Office desk fans for screws, and clipboards for springs. 
---
Personally, I like hitting sugar grove for both, but so do lots of other people.
---
Awesome
---
Missed that one, will edit later (need to condense characters as I'm at about 60,000, and they have a 40k limit)
---
I've never gotten a message that my bag was looted, but I lose the skull and crossbones death marker all the time.
---
Patrol duty my friend.
---
That could be why.  The only friendly voice you stumble across and it becomes familiar but rare. 
---
Interesting, what testing was done to isolate? (Not challenging, curious)
---
I'm really not though. I was fine until the other player came in and bumped the difficulty. After that the sentry at half my health with each missile. By the time I sunk all of my bullets into him I was low on stim. The assaultrons ate the last 3 or so.
---
Second time I made it past the sentry no issue, then the assaultrons and Mr. Gutsies got spiked and I was getting demolished again.
---
I'm high enough for the base levels, easily, but the scaling is just mind-boggling. 
---
Same here except I ended up with that creepy "get into my ice cream truck" let's play paint. Checked Bethesda website for info on refund, it sent me to Playstation and I didn't find anything there.
---
Okay my man I appreciate the advice this was really helpful.
---
üò≥

---
That is hella cool and I absolutely adore your screenshot to photo comparisons.
---
Don‚Äôt be a cunt. There‚Äôs fair, honourable pvp and then there‚Äôs being a douchebag that runs around the map destroying camps with a bunch of their buddies because they know they‚Äôd die without backup. That might be possible within the games limitations but it certainly should not be a part of it. Games are supposed to be fun, and if the vast majority of players don‚Äôt like that mechanic then it needs to be changed.
---
If you are PC I would be happy to craft you serums at cost :)
---
Huh, so in your delusional fantasy land did Bethesda pay reviewers to bash Mass Effect Andromeda too?
---
It‚Äôs amazing seeing how universally gamers on the internet have no idea how the actual world works. It‚Äôs like some of them really do never leave their parents basements.
---
All NPCS are voice recordings in video games. 
---
Thanks for the link. Never heard of straw man argument. I‚Äôd link sarcasm but I‚Äôm sure you can look that up yourself. 
---
By your limited definition you are correct no NPCs. Of course we all knew that going in.  
---
I won‚Äôt fault you for categorizing it as worse. I just like to put a caveat in that I can only speak for my own experience. Which it does seem like it‚Äôs worse. 
---
I have had luck with National Isolated Radio Array and West Tek
---
both places spawn a lot a super mutants, often i find 3-star legendearies and the sometimes drop screws
---
I appreciate the offer man but I‚Äôm gonna follow the guy who responded to you‚Äôs advice. Happy to play with you though.
---
Lmao, by "her" I meant my alt character. My main has the X-01 armor, so I wanted to get something different for my alt, who happens to be a female. 
---
Ironically I'm getting downvotes on this...  
---
But thanks!
---
Vampire needs a buff..
---
Of course, in the same way if I had the ability to magically bestow a shower of golden coins on everyone I met, that would be better as well.
---
The fact that I can't doesn't mean I'm to blame if someone is poor, or if someone steals from another.
---
I had the same feeling, so what I did instead was to stick to the Forest area of the map and clear every single location, take every single work bench (one at a time, and defend the bench at least once). Then I moved up to the northern area (can't remember the name) and repeated. Then the Ash Heap and did the same. 
---
Forget the story for a while and level up in areas with lower level caps. If you can't familiar with what the level caps are in which area, you can google it real quick. 
---
Not only will you level up fast (killing stuff is the fastest way to level), but you'll get an embarrassing amount of awesome loot.
---
Also, make sure you're crafting the most level-relevant armor and guns every five levels! And don't be shy about shooting up some psycho/med-ex... just keep some adictol on hand. 
---
For guns, I just craft/scrap lvl 15 handmades to learn the mods.
---
Armor, hmmm when buy at a vendor you buy chest or limbs, no? So scrapping for mods would work the same? Haven't tried for limbs specifically.
---
You can use the Nuka Cola variant in white springs (grape I think) and the perk card to double effects to remove a lot of rads without losing a mutation. Though you can only buy 1 a server hop so you can either hop a bunch and stockpile or use when it is most needed.
---
For real. Almost every time I log in I end up cutting my session short because of a crash. 
---
They come from Whitesprings upstairs vendor bot with the nuka cola stand. I have had about 10 built up before. It's a good drink and relatively cheap. Peeps probably just server hopping to buy it up.
---
There was a post here not too long ago suggesting Grahm have a radio station and while he rambles he would mention things he sees around him.  Brilliant, if you ask me. 
---
 We are a highly organized group, those big groups nothing ever really happens with them.
---
The nukas you see exist in the game, but got duped to hell. They did that since you can spam the drink button and get a cap every time
---
Theres one by where I placed my camp. It's not a popular spot but I've only seen it there 2x in 2 weeks. So I dont think its other players grabbing it but I could be wrong. 
---
Jeff?
---
Has anyone nuked the island?  Or area nearby?
---
The two times that I've been killed by other players have happened as I'm loading in. Once I loaded in dead (with the other player standing over me) and the other time I loaded in, but none of the objects had loaded in and I couldn't see the other player for about 30 seconds. I just kept taking damage until I died. *sigh* 
---
&gt;  I did ask the car I was riding 
---
You have conversations with cars? 
---
Bugged.
---
They‚Äôre in game along with wild, orange and dark.  On the second level of whitespring there is a red ms. Nanny unit that sells them.  She is next to a large pink room :)
---
For reference to everyone who won‚Äôt know this right away, Drakozen is our elder
---
Agreed, what a moron, shouldn't be allowed period.
---
*comes to a sub about game that he hates* 
---
Seems like my locations have been respawning about every 10 to 14 days....
---
There is a second whitesprings vendorbot? I only knew about the one at the train station. Where is it?
---
Really? Do you have a source for that? I'd love to hear about those plans. :)
---
Everyone should upvote and get this on the front page of imgur.
---
 Study your junk. I know there are 2 screws in a Carlisle Typewriter while only 1 in a normal one. Did you know every tin can has 1 Lead ... I could go on for a long time. ;)
---
As far as I understand it, the level does not matter   but for armor mods it is piece specific (i.e. chest = chest mods and leg = leg mod) but I'm not sure if you have to do both legs and/or arms to unlock mods for left and right
---
Who's jeff
---
Have the ability to change the Fusion Core auto select in PA, I would rather the ability to have it use lower cores before my full cores. Nothing g worse than when a laser Gatling gun pulls a low core because the power armor at all the full cores.
---
Put all your junk away, there is a known bug
---
&gt;Anything above 16ms can cause noticeable hiccups as the main game loop is tied to timely server response.
---
      
---
I have 17ms to a server in my area. I highly doubt you need to connect to Amazon at that low of a ping. Either way, if they are connecting me to BFE, that is on them. I will still test it though. I already confined it to one NUMA node (core affinity) and also tried UMA mode.  Run a gauntlet of speed tests for memory, drives, etc. Everything is system normal. I have like a 3200 MB/s throughput on the RAID when checked through ATTO. My system disk is on another seperate SSD. I have spare PCIe lanes connected to the core... like PCIe for days. 
---
            
---
&gt;(For me, the issue is with loading hiccups, audio specifically, on a SATA 500MB/s SSD. Pretty frequently, the game suddenly loads about 90MB of audio data that causes a 200 millisecond hiccup at this speed. 
---
              
---
I will take a closer look at my drive reads and possibly chart the throughput. 
---
I found a 3 star pool cue. 
---
I think it was hunters extra damage to animals, 90% weight reduction and something else can't remember. 
---
But I have so much fun running around smackin' and whackin' (not so much hackin') mobs and knocking them over. You just here a whack! Smack! And they fall over. Like me while I laugh at the whole situation. 
---
I think the best part of this fun weapon is that it's weight reduction even with the barbed mod made it weigh 0.08. 
---
Which was, before the update, less than a Bobby pin. And I couldn't help but let my mind wander and think what kind of fun I'd have smackin' and whackin' (not so much hackin' but maybe stabbin' or jabbin') all the mobs with a Bobby pin which weighed 0.02 more than my pool cue. 
---
Have you done the quest to get it??
---
I... really wish I‚Äôd seen this a few days ago. I assumed trading them would be more expensive but I didn‚Äôt think about crafting. 
---
Robco has some too but sugar Grove is best for screws and springs unless it was recently looted 
---
Dude I‚Äôm just writing my post quota to earn my astroturfing dollars from uh...EA? Or whoever you think is paying everyone to not like fallout 76? Why you gotta be so bitter about a honest day‚Äôs work 
---
A guy I work with. All his online names incorporate pandas.
---
Have you done the Firebreathers questline yet? That's how you get Firebreather gear.
---
Pretty sure diluted will remove a mutation as well.
---
Inside the white springs resort?
---
Second floor of Whitesprings Resort. look for the pink room when walking around.
---
And we need new recipes! Dog Stews, Dog Pie, Dog Steak
---
Yep
---
Afraid I'm not Jeff but he sounds like a stellar guy 
---
Wireshark for dwellers? :)
---
Yup, if they go full PVP, it's going to be just people one shotting each other. If they make any changes such as scaling damage or armor then people who put a lot of time into their stats will feel cheated. Seems like it's lose lose. They're better off just ditching PVP entirely
---
same situation here. It's either 0/10 for every flower with no change after picking up flowers or just stuck like this: [https://i.imgur.com/sH7hc0V.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sH7hc0V.jpg)
---
He's a good dude.
---
You can buy one per server hop from the Whitesprings vendor upstairs. It takes forever to get a decent amount. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they are a popular item to dupe.
---
Boston was very similar to this. The only difference was that some locations we're drastically scaled down or clumped together. Other than that it was the same for me. Super cool seeing my old hometown.
---
I just had to bash mine against a rock for 20 mins.. half spilled into a nearby creek. Now I use my grognak axe for a cleaner can cut
---
did this come with .50  hardened receiver , or u modify it ?
---
OH LMAO, 
---
whoops that uhhhhhh embarrassing 
---
You'll love to know there are about 12\~ vendors in the downstairs section !
---
How much is ‚Äúat cost‚Äù for these? Do you have all the plans? I have four more mutations that I want, and would love to throw some caps your direction for some serums!
---
Tell him that random internetguy123 said hi lol
---
I think The Division did it wonderfully. Have a pvp zone that oeople can join. Have events or activities thst are always pvp. Like how the event in watoga high school is, (I think it is monster mash).
---
... I'm level 145 I had no idea.
---
It's inside the protected zone that surrounds Vault 76, so it can't be nuked. It's a shame, it would have been a perfect spot for a unique Deathclaw raid boss. 
---
Nah you don't want too much shit jn the Atom Shop.  Everything from 2019? Are you nuts? What is the point of that?
---
What are you even talking about bro, where did anyone in this thread saying game reviewers were being paid to write reviews?
---
You crazy man, need to cut back on the caffeine.
---
Totally agree. Whoever creates items for Atomic shop has no idea who's the player base and why are people play Fallout.
---
Which defies all logic. He only reason I could see someone down voting this is because you might have pointed out an exploit or issue that benefits then. :(
---
I scraped mine. Ita purchaseable at the vendor I think? Every other faction puts you purchase the outfits again in my experience anywho.
---
Transmutation and combine legendary weapons for added effects at a low % or it becomes scrapped? 
---
No I don't. I don't much like the inability to fight back if I'm attacked, even if it's just slap damage.
---
I know, beggars and choosers and all that.
---
Put in a ticket. Something may be able to be done. Think I read of someone having the same issue and getting it fixed, but honestly that was well over a month ago so I may be misremembering. It's a part of their microtransaction structure, so you're going to get better support for direct involvement as opposed to macro-scale game conditions.
---
76‚Äôs server stability has always been extremely poor. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if little things like this still set it off. I once had to attempt to launch a nuke 5 times in a row because the servers kept crashing with everyone getting kicked. It still isn‚Äôt fixed so I suggest you just drop things when it doesn‚Äôt matter if you get kicked.
---
He would get a kick outta that lol.
---
Yes, the character is only Lvl 50
---
Fair point but it is useful to mine black titanium and gears .. someone said, 2 can spawn .. there is a place just above huntersville not he east side of the Emerson or something, spawns a death claw higher than your level, easy to kill as well as two in the Waste Dump also low level. Also one somewhere near the freak show in the open, but can't remember, ran into him.
---
I agree, being a island probably should of been more challenging and bigger. Deathclaws are pussies in this game, not the bigger fish.
---
Inside the resort on the lower level are a bunch of different shops like armor or food, tons of crafting machines &amp; stash box in Artesian's Corner. It's like a main mall area and will hopefully be expanded in a future DLC.
---
Sounds better than the other offers. I‚Äôd rather take more though. If you give me an offer I‚Äôm happy with I‚Äôll ship it to you for free. 
---
Yes, I know the "leather pocked arm plan" and "leather pocketed chest plan" were separate items with the vendors. 
---
Whooa it's rly amazing, thx for sharing.
---
Wonder how much promotion it brings to Greenbrier WV
---
Step out of the armor and do a switch of the higher fusion core with a lower charged one so that it uses the low one first. That's what I do......
---
i have been keeping an eye out for posts like these. i'm a filthy casual and dont log in until weekends so i end up missing all the limited stuff. Thanks for your hard work! 
---
She will land has been my experience.
---
I've noticed it's 50 spread thoughout one Xbox doesn't matter if separation of accounts its shared  that's a drag...
---
There's really no way to know for sure, but it's probably possible either way
---
Not all of them do.. Or it bugs a lot. A usually have their own caps.
---
I'd happily buy atoms if I could a German Shepard and name him Catfruit
---
Yeah I have lost count how many times I‚Äôve been asked if I‚Äôve done the quests.
---
from their clarification to the inside the vault there is going to be a separate pvp mode while the base game will remain as is.
---
haha brilliant!
---
I'll just drop them off and leave. I've dropped like 4 people off at camp McClintock like I was a proud father
---
It's mostly anecdotal evidence, but I first came across the potential solution from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahxszd/anyone_who_has_been_experiencing_an_influx_in/)
---
I had rebuilt my PS4 database a day or so prior to this redditor, and while it helped my load-times, my game would still crash frequently, especially near areas with lots of NPC's (Watoga, Whitespring, etc). I removed my Excavator's helmet, and re-crafted a new one without the Targeting HUD mod, and I haven't had a single crash since in 10+ hours of gameplay. Previous, with the helm mod on, it would take 30 seconds to 10 minutes of running around Watoga to blue-screen crash on PS4.
---
I'm assuming I could re-introduce the issue by putting the old helm back on.
---
The other few replies I got were mostly paranoid fallout 76 apologists talking about how evil EA was paying everyone to not like the game they like 
---
It couldn‚Äôt be because the 50 metacritic game is...you know, bad? No that‚Äôs way too simple and rational a reason
---
I already commented, but I just remembered - last night on my new character (level 14) I tried to do the raider quest which I hadn't done yet. I made it to the second floor of Top of the World, stepped out of the elevator, and came face-to-face with a Scorched Controller, which I hadn't come across yet. Confidently, as with every scorched I've encountered thus far, I swung my sickle expecting to chunk. 
---
It did not end well for me.

---
Yes, didn't work for me either when it dropped last night. XBOX
---
I've got the nukacola rocket girl outfit, but nothing else really interests me.  I picked up the tricentennial edition back around launch so I can rock some paint on my power armour, which to my preferences, beat out the other PA paints available now.  The sniper outfit looks pretty cool but I'm not sure I want to drop the 1400 atoms on it.  
---
I agree though, they need some more lore stuff in the store to balance out the fluff stuff.  And some fucking weapon paints, I want a hot pink hand made!  The tricentennial weapon paints are nice, but I only use the 10mm pistol.  The laser rifle, (and energy weapons in general, are crap right now.  The hatchet is pointless after level five, if it makes it that far lol.
---
You can actually craft fusion cores at the tinker's workbench
---
Where's my Scorched plague doctor outfit?
---
Its annoying as hell.
---
I'd add nuclear waste only because I had a quest that needed it and it took me fucking ages to get it gathered.
---
Grahm!
---
You can't tame that one, its not a random encounter
---
Thanks. I'm pretty sure that the arm mods cover both arms (left and right), because I've bought plans for "arms" before. I just wasn't sure if scrapping could get you mods for different body parts. There's so little armor on enemies to scrap that I haven't gotten a chance to test. 
---
Updated my Nvidia drivers and my crashes dropped considerably. 
---
Well this is a well thought out post
---
If you haven‚Äôt reached it  3 months in already why are you even concerned ?
---
On PS4 they save on your photo gallery, but if you delete them from the game they dont show as load screens anymore
---
Yes. Seriously. 
---
That's the final straw for me
---
I've not broken 3000 Caps and I'm 46, but I don't get oodles of loot either.  I horde junk and burn ammo.
---
Listening to her slowly die through the holotape broke my heart. I kept that compensated 10mm for a long time.

Chemistry Station, not Tinker's Workbench. And it costs 1 of every type of pure flux; not exactly worth it IMO.

I would think the rads would be killing the parasites. I could be wrong. I know that bacteria doesn‚Äôt fare well from radiation. There are dead trees in Ukraine that haven‚Äôt rotted do to a lack of bacteria on account of Chernobyl. Technically food and other items should actually last a bit longer. Though different universe different rules I guess.

Ps4.

Just bought hatchet Tom vendor and I can't equip it (acts like I should butdoesnt and no level too low wording or anything)
---
Can't sell back to vendor either. Doesn't appear in list.  
---
Seemed like a nice melee weapon. Would be nice to use what I spent all my caps on.
---
That can be time consuming if your always doing that. Lot a of people want the most out of there play time.
---
They could remove the limit and give caps weight üòÇ
---
yeah, that has happened to me a few times, especially where her loot doesn't load then she just pops off and vanishes. Nightmare... 
---
&gt; Weighing 3 pounds, having 20 total is more than enough in my opinion
---
There's a 3-star intelligence perk that reduces the weight of all energy ammo, including fusion and plasma cores, by 90%. Makes carrying a buttload of them not horrible, and saves on stash space.
---
The water isn't the evil here, it's the lights.
---
I've come back to my base to craft and thought about how poor the lighting was in game today... for a while. Someone turned everything off. Took me too long to realize there wasn't a misplaced wire.

I hated whoever did it as well as myself

I agree with this QoL fix, it should have worked this way from the start.

Zero story or game play, just constant, unending dick helicoptering. Sounds like a blast /s
---
Lol could be
---
Nah. I'd rather climb into a her than a him anyway. 
---
What's your "reserve" price? Judging by the retail cost of the power armor edition and all its contents, $50 is probably the most logical price for the helmet. Not trying to fight or anything, just curious.
---
at cost = crafting materials. I do have all the plans. I do not need caps or anything else. I would ask you just help others that you can.
---
Most of the stuff that they're slowly releasing has been in the game's files ever since the BETA, so it's not like they're making stuff based on what the people are buying
---
Sometimes it's fun because I'll run away some, go camo and undetected, then hit them with my gauss rifle. Good times. 
---
Smells like someone dupped badly

Weird be very solid information, will edit and add the PA section!

Naw I'm good.

I literally found so many plans that I had no idea where to find and I had been looking for. You are a godsend!
---
U ever corner a guy and kill then revive them repeatedly? That shits funny. 
---
Aha understood. Which kind of flux do they need?
---
Pvp has potential, but it‚Äôs shit right now. I‚Äôll play on the pvp server anyway but here‚Äôs hoping they actually balance combat. 
---
I agree. I typically hate PvP as well, but I don't want people to not have it if they want it. That being said, the PvP was just not integrated well at all. There's no real reason to actually participate in it, other than to grief. It basically just exists so that assholes can go around trying to ruin other people's day. 
---
No cause that sounds like a super shitty thing to do.

Ok I'll be back home in about 30 minutes

You obviously do care otherwise you wouldn't have read and commented. Go troll someone else. 
---
Yeah it has lower defenses, and built in 100 carrying capacity if you wear the full set, plus the mining bonus mentioned above. You can add another 50 per leg with the calibrated shocks. It's the only PA i use
---
A after you log in wait for about 5 minutes with out moving or doing anything. Servers have super shitty for ps4 since last patch.  But after the wait everything should be loaded in fine. 
---
Still not there after that? Check your stash other wise your like A few others and just s.o.l.
---
Yeah if Rover gets popped right as the countdown ends, he just tries to fight after repair and something never triggers.  Happens all the time. I hate it so much. 
---
Yeah I'd say about the same from my experience. I dont even bother with them most of the time. 
---
Well I learned something new today, I never knew about other flavors than the three you find in the wild.
---
Yeah, if I were running into the same situations, I would be equally as adamant about having them work on stability over any other issue.  I'm sorry to see you having so much trouble, as it is a fun game (when it's working).  One of the guys I run with is playing on a day 1 xbox, and he does have to restart more often, so I'm wondering if I just have a better experience due to the 1X hardware.
---
But, I do see them addressing stability with every patch, so hopefully it will become less of a problem for you as time goes on.
---
Should I be a marketplace shill instead?
---
I just got it for PC since my friends stopped playing on Xbox. ADD ME :D

Don't call people out for dupin gif you have no proof, with the time played, getting decent drops and being an active merchant believe it or not does merit a reward in caps. I have 1 character with a little over 18k caps and it's all legit and another with almost 10k which is all legit. Don't slander people over your ill luck until you can prove it.
---
The same way as consul? PC has next to little excuse as well since you guys got your push to talk function. Emotes are the safest way. Shooting someone directly is just asking for return fire. 
---
There is a chance it will drop from the first two Responder missions. The best way to get it is to make new characters and just farm it.

To add to this, Face the bar, take your first left, go down the halway take another left and you're there.

Couple of posts down has same issue
---
Good, thats very raider like. In previous fallout games you had been given a quest like :" a raider group has been causing trouble, i marked the location on your map so you can kill them". 
---
Now you can make a highly defensive camp, with traps, turrets and what not since the chance of you getting attacked in your base has been increased significantly.
---
I‚Äôve picked tons of all the listed flowers and got credit for some then later it went back to 0/10 for all types.  Now I pick and get nothing.  Very frustrating!
---
I do it with the whitespring trash cans and the blue suitcase in the Watoga train station to give ammo I don‚Äôt use to my friends almost daily. Prolly just bad timing.

I wonder if the second 1100 was an error? If it was 1110 then they are just counting 8-15 (or H-M)

It's worth putting in a ticket.

I bought, of all things, the Bad Luck face tattoo.  I immediately submitted a ticket explaining my mistake.  A few days later I was given a refund.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm very sorry that your recent Atomic Shop purchase did not meet your expectations. As a one time courtesy I have refunded the purchase price in Atoms.  Please keep the item as well, on the house.  I hope you will enjoy other Atomic Shop purchases in the future!&gt;

The interface for the pc is non that intuitive and I may have been on a LONG play session which caused me to double click when I shouldn't have.

Good luck

There is still emotes. They can send a private message. I don't know why you keep pushing this like they are justified in shooting directly to get attention. Would you use violence in the real world in order to find out where something is inside of a store? I guess common sense still isn't common. 
---
People tend to stray away from flamers due to the amount of fuel it consumes nonetheless I do agree, vampire weapons need some tending to along with flamer fuel consumption. or just make it easier to make or find to even the balance.

I dove down a holotape from Hopewell Cave and made a post about it a while ago. Thought it was neat.

I had the most fun last night fighting a scorch beast at White Springs that I've had many other online game.
---
If they added dog companions to fo76, I would absolutely use ToddBucks for other "skins" (breeds). 
---
Yeah, this is the one area where 76 really lives up to it's predecessors; the real life locations in the game have been recreated beautifully. I remember similar posts/videos for 3 and New Vegas, and it's always uncanny how good a job they did. 
---
This is one of the reasons I think 76 still has a chance at being a great game; there's a fantastic core, it's the stuff built up around it that needs work.
---
I've repaired someone else's turrets before after whacking some enemies that were wailing on their base from miles away.
---
It is the length of your workshop circle. But also if you aren't in a team you wont be able to build near each other as it results in conflicting zones. Hence the reason if one of you logs in before the other than the other players camp can not be placed.
---
&gt; the main design fail of this game is the inventory system:
---
it really is.  such a massive mistake, as it adds nothing to the game but tedium.  
---
it also has terrible adverse affect on stream viewing of the game (twitch, etc) because nobody wants to watch people forever screwing with their inventory and/or vendors).
---
by far the biggest design mistake of this game, among a great many  design mistakes.  sad.
---
The stealth mode increases movement speed in sneak mode which is nice, but low defense and lack of a secondary mod slot for deep pockets makes it a lower level item. 
---
On a side note I found some legendary level 1 items from legendary eye bots. Anybody into this stuff? 
---
Yeah they pretty much nailed the majority of the places.mI live a little outside of Charleston which kinda feels off but, hey its a game. 
---
So that‚Äôs why the lock picks were .1 lb...
---
No was just trying to help, but clearly your above that so no matter ;)
---
You can definitely get the slap damage up to lethal levels. I‚Äôm a 120 something and I walked out of my base the other night and was straight up murdered. Didn‚Äôt know what happened, my friend came over to help but he just kept one shotting us. Good times. 
---
The L2P dropouts from real PvP games have come to 76 and have a super-big inferiority complex they want to hash-out with you, without your consent.
---
That's actually a good strategy against sentinel. Force them to move from radiation then hit them. 
---
I'll be using this, thanks!
---
Are you sure it actually exists?
---
None of the wikis mention it. 
---
Its only numberss
---
unless you actually try to use that much of the phamtom budget.
---
Sucks that this happened you may be able to restore it and downlad your saves from psplus cloud save!
---
pretty much this. 
---
letting players craft stuff will just lead to everyone having the exact same "perfect tse" bullshit that's been the meta since it was discovered.
---
I think legendaries should be upgradable/downgradable like the weapons you get from the Mistress of Mystery quest
---
 Its pretty strange. I had a look last time I was blocked from my CAMP and the other CAMP was a long way from where mine would have gone. On the same long pond but not close together at all. You could probably put 4 CAMP circles along that pond without touching each other and he was several away.

I had the same basic issue.  From the late teens to the early 30s, it was a terrible, grindy slog for me (a bit like real life, eh?).  Then, around level 35, all kinds of things started going right.  I got better plans, weapons, armor, my build (it wasn't a planned build by any means) started coming together.  I breezed through the next 5 levels, sneezed when I hit 40 and i'm level 51 or 52 now (almost, again, like real life, eh?).  I about gave up on this game, but then my brother in law started playing.  Having a group really changed things for me.
---
if you're on pc, i'd be happy to team with you and help you level a bit by helping with your quests, if you like. 
---
Are you stupid or just trolling? Most dupers have 4-5 characters (or more) with maxed caps.
---
If you've played every day for the 2+ months the game has been out you could easily have earned 80k caps or more just from selling junk gear/weapons to vendors. Don't accuse people of doing stupid shit because you suck.
---
&gt;People did all those things because they're cheap or stupid.
---
Or both.
---
Thank you for sharing this! So great. 
---
Fucking annoying especially when you have about 1800 of a thing.
---
A simple, "Owned" or "New" in the title would be awesome.
---
Plan - New - plan name
---
Plan - Owned - plan name
---
And if a vendor has 4 of a plan that costs 480 caps please default the purchase to 1, dammit. Don't just click through your purchase, slow down and read the message box. That (4) at the end was out of the text box and got me. 
---
I want to be able to set if the dog is going to attack if it is currently undetected as well.  A dog would be great for a sniper companion if it would only stay until you tell it to attack.
---
Pvp is literally the worst system in any game I've ever played.
---
Do SOMETHING to at least allow players who want to fight to do so without penalty.

I‚Äôm pretty sure a nuka cola grenade staggers them also.

Can't we tame snallygasters and ride them? 
---
Holly shit, the resort entrance, the one at the end of the corridor and swings out of the wall! I had no idea it was real! I mean, I knew about the bunker, but I had no idea that specific door existed. Awesome!
---
I like the 25,000 limit.  It keeps inflation down in the trading reddit.  You can't do trades for more than 25,000 caps without involving risky alt trades.  So I very very very rarely see people asking more than 25,000 caps for any single item.  Usually at that point they're asking for item for item trades.
---
If you have caps, go spend them on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits already!  People are selling things for caps 24/7 there :)
---
Most of them I've purchased tbh.  If you'd like any other serums hit me up (tag: Trin8Brian).  I have several I can offload and I don't charge 400-500 c like most.  üòâ
---
True. They‚Äôd make things a lot easier if you had the ability to set item prices *outside* of the trade menu. Not to mention marking certain stuff as not being for sale. 
---
It does exist the wiki is just out of date
---
Confirmed xbox as well, but if you hit the left bumper or left on the d pad it will reset from 0 to 25k so you have to be careful. 
---
Sure! Just pay whatever you feel is fair. Let me know which flux you need and Ill move them to my main. Ill be on around 5 EST when I get home from work my IGN is Karthathan. 
---
Yes please.  Drives me nuts that it will take the HIGHEST charged core out of your pack.  Have it put in the LOWEST charged core.   That way I'm losing that extra weight and only carrying good charged cores.
---
The fact is that the game is 10 bucks in an online store after like what 2 months since release
---
I will be on around 6 EST, hope you‚Äôre still on!
---
People have said it does, but I haven't noticed an increase yet. 
---
nope
---
&gt;All NPCS are voice recordings in video games. 
---
I'm not sure what you mean by that. NPCs are usually voice acted, yeah, but not all the time. Is that what you meant? Let me also again state that a voice recording/holotape in Fallout 76 is not an "NPC", and to count it as one is utterly ridiculous....
---
&gt; Thanks for the link. Never heard of straw man argument. I‚Äôd link sarcasm but I‚Äôm sure you can look that up yourself. 
---
I just find it ironic since you accused me of not having any counter argument.
---
&gt; By your limited definition you are correct no NPCs. Of course we all knew that going in.
---
Yeah as if my "limited definition" is the problem here...
---
Sure, a bug in fallout 76 is the same as a deadly disease that takes away loved ones- Not cool.

Just surprised the server dropping issues have bled into month what?  3-4?  I‚Äôm only mid 50s so I‚Äôm just not getting to later stuff but I‚Äôd rather server improvements before DLC stuff but I know ppl who power leveled or play more are probably getting tired of the same stuff
---
Genuinely it's hard to tell if you're a senile old man or a poorly educated youth, the Venn diagram would be interesting.  I said, go punch in, and be good at the game; no one cares.

What's your evidence? Have you seen video or screenshots of it? 
---
Finally! I've been saying there needs to be a rapid response team to combat raiders.
---
As a raider on PS4, I can't wait to see you out there. All we've wanted was a good fight!
---
Got word from another settlement that needs our help. I'll mark it on your map. 
---
It does not, and no, you cannot.
---
There actually is/was a mod for FO4 that required a screwdriver to be in your inventory for lock picking for this exact reason.
---
wtf are you 12?
---
May be they should just add the recipe for crafting boiled water from purified (purified + tree -&gt; 2 boiled). So we'll have an opportunity to convert needed amount of purified water into boiled.

Nope im a 9 year old
---
i always get a little sad when i find one of these poor souls. There but for the grace of god, goes I...
---
It's sad to say but I wish the SBQ required more then one player to kill, a lot of people can solo her easily even without TSE . I do agree they need to add more event that require grouping however they have no incentive to because all the content is able to be solo'd which I think should not be the case at all.
---
We need legit Raids, legit dungeons, and legit events, ones that are instance and some that allow your team to grow larger than 4 players max. An instanced raid / raid event should allow a minimum of 4 players up to a maximum party of 8. 
---
No idea where u live mate. Im sorry to hear u dont have cheap stores like that. I guess that the traveling merchant that comes to your village will always ask for full price, but that doesnt mean that is the case all around the globe.
---
Honestly, if i would encounter Preston.. I am gonna shoot at him.. 
---
I thought they changed it so it equips the lowest charged core in your inv after emptying one.
---
Its been doing that for me.
---
I think PvP has it's place in the Fallout environment. Although sadly with so many TSE being swathed about it negates the chance for PvP to thrive in the wasteland. The latest datamine shows Bethesda is actively trying to update a situation where PvP can be viable. Although I don't think a BR or KoH scenario will play as they forsee without making  sanctioned PVP only servers and having  players who choose to participate start with a new character. If they choose to update the PvE environment with what is shown in the datamine to be PvP based it will just further fan the flames of a one shot PvP  wasteland.
---
TL;DR PvP is boring in FO76 thanks to TSE.
---
I‚Äôd really like 100 dollars. But since I probably can‚Äôt get that, I‚Äôd settle for 70-80. I‚Äôll probably end up putting it for bid on eBay. What do you think the starting bid should be? If you can offer me something I‚Äôm happy with I‚Äôll just sell it to you. Otherwise I‚Äôll put it up for bid. 
---
You are so wrong.  It just works.  Some Toad guy said so.  Ironically.
---
1. **Never buy serums from the Enclave Vendor!**  4,000 caps is a waste.  Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  People sell serums there for 500-1000 caps max all the time.  Sometimes less.
---
2. To run mutations effectively you need the perks Starched Genes (locks in mutations) and Class Freak (max level reduces bad effects 75%).  If you don't have starched genes, radaway and decon showers will REMOVE your mutations.
---
3. You can have as many mutations as you like.  Please note, some are not beneficial for all builds (aka don't get 19 mutations).  You cannot get a DOUBLE marsupial or DOUBLE of any mutation.  Drinking the serum again just suppresses the negative effects of that mutation for 1 hour (not worth it).
---
Hope that helps!
---
There is a vendor in whitespring with them 
---
As long as we can add the baby shark song as well
---
so when are we getting married?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty shitty. 
---
I may have made a mistake too.  I was doing this between things at work and may have messed up
---
No one has been able to prove one way or another, some say if you build a camp and then move it, it increases after you levelled up but others have built at a low level and a high level 50 chairs on each or something and the budget is the same.
---
I would say it does not increase. Maybe they will do a camp DLC update and enhance it, I expect they will do more improvements, we just have to be patient .. it sucks at the moment.
---
This is not how grinding works...
---
When you would be able to craft exactly those legendary effects, which you really want/need, there would be no reason for the endless end game gear grind. So from a developers point of view this would cut the end game resp. player base, because there is nothing left (no story, no big endboss dungeon, nothing....) to do when you have all the sweer gear with best stats.
---
So the only thing to keep players playing after reaching max. level and min/max all stats is the random gear/legendary drop. And when you can one-shot every enemy like others suggested with max gear Fallout 76 becomes boring as hell (except for PVP?!? But there is the problem of booblehead-stacking, so you would also be able to one-shot players xD)
---
Wow! That's so cool! I sure hope you didn't get on the bus though. There's grenades in there!  Seriously though did you notice if there's a water fountain in the gazebo?
---
Thanks again for the tour! 
---
Maybe they server hop so much they‚Äôve avoided many of the crashes. Though I don‚Äôt know how they can wait through all those loading screens. 
---
Yup. Shoot it down. Aim for the propellers to slow it down.
---
Because the quality of the game died half way through Fallout 4. The endings were anticlimactic. The game play changed from diverse and creative to fixed and basic. Post interviews state the team was working on making Fallout 4 with online capabilities. Obviously it was too glitchy and problematic, and they removed the online capabilities. 2 years later, they remaster the code that was trashed. I.E. Put a graphics engine on it.
---
Why do you need to contract herpes to have an opinion on herpes? Your mindset doesn't make any sense. You are attacking people for not buying something I, and with MANY MANY PEOPLE, find is trash. I am attacking a company for doing a bad job.
---
Thanks brudda!
---
I think we should get a chance to take the named kitty, that needs to be fed in Fallout 76, as a pet/companion. Not that he should follow us or be able to attack, but to be there when we get home.  It would connect the players to the world. Give them a reason to care about Appalachia.
---
A dog would be great too. It doesn't have to be Dog Meat, what about Sparky in Fallout 4 , I would take her in a heart beat. Mutant hound in my yard, that would be wonderful. Or even build a "Codsworth" as a companion at home.
---
Fallout 76 is one of the hardest games to connect to, and I don't mean the servers dropping me every few minutes.
---
Well written post as always.
---
You have to shoot the cargo bot out of the sky, aiming for the engines, once broken it'll move slower
---
I did not see or notice a water fountain - and come to think of it, I've never found the one in the game either! Maybe I just don't know what I'm looking for/at.
---
Not better.
---
DM'd you.
---
The auto cargo drop is a different quest.
---
Naah, as far as I know they have a lot of eyes on their back... sitting on all of their eyes while riding them is kinda strange lmao
---
I didn't know that one either, but it's probably just the "different universe" thing. It's mutated to adapt to its environment, just like every other creature post-War. I mean, there are diseases that didn't exist pre-War, who's to say some random parasite didn't mutate in the irradiated water like Bone Worms or whatever bacteria causes the Woopsies?
---
Yup. Nightmare. 
---
An interesting idea, but I don't think the game really needs it. You can just capture any of the several power plant workshops or gather flux types to craft your own cores. 
---
I'm not trying to knock on your idea, it's interesting and you've made a good argument for balancing it's usefulness with cost requirements and limits. I just personally don't see a need for it with the various other options for FC management. (Also I like to go on adventures to gather materials or capture and repair machines as opposed to just popping by the camp to pick up a fresh core whenever.)
---
I ran into Grahm in Charleston. Was fighting a grafton monster (i was like lvl 15) and he suddenly appeared. Didnt bother him bc i didnt know he has nice stuff. Same happenend with the  traveling bot merchant. Saw him and didnt bother. Probably a mistake. 
---
Bad luck man.
---
FYI Ghouls get HEALED by this gun.  So 30% more to ghouls is probably going to HEAL them more....lol
---
I wish they'd give us better drops.  Or at least the ability to scrap legendary items for a 5% chance to pull 1 perk off that we can mod another item with.  First though they need to allow us to LOCK items in our inventory so they can't be dropped, scrapped, traded to vendors, or traded to players.
---
Or tame Moleminers and ride them? 
---
Yes PS4 has this bad. 
---
I've resorted to using the L1 and just jumping all the way through the 25000 down to 0. Lol
---
Clearly you just have a 92 pound shotgun

Its actually that the legendary effect applies to the base weapon, any mods weigh the same, if I'm not mistaken.

Only herbivore/carnivore are exclusive.

Not until higher level can you greet class freak which lowers the negative effects.

Fallout 4 and DLC awaits for a more premium SP experience. Otherwise be thankful you can play with your friends.
---
You're able to repair their stuff in workshops, even if you're not on their team.  Not sure if it works that way in camps.
---
You might have to wait until something is completely broken though.
---
I'd really love a REPAIR TO FULL function.  Having those half filled health bars messes with my OCD.  If they implement that, NO FLUX for decon shower repair to full plz (only take flux if it's destroyed).
---
I had my first engagement the other day, while teamed with a friend. We were at his camp and 2 people began attacking us. I was trying to ignore then got pissed off and attacked back. They killed me. I respawned and killed one. Then his buddy killed me again. I set both to ignore then respawned. They could still see me and killed me again. I would have assumed ignore would have prevented them from seeing me but I guess not. :\ Pretty stupid. I don‚Äôt want to have to sign out/back in to get away from a player. If we can‚Äôt block griefers it would be nice to be able to be a total passive player who cannot be engaged.

I recently found a vampiric Mr Handy Buzzsaw and it makes me borderline unkillable while using it. Repaired to 200% condition with the electric modifier it deals over 120 damage per hit as well.

That explains it!!!! Thanks man! I have a fatman that weighs 2lbs, called the daisycutter. It has zero mods so it is cleared up for me now.

There are screenshots and multiple posts about it.

Kill the vertibots. Once they are dead the cargobots will fly in a circle instead of noping out on you.
---
I have the plans and can make it.  I won't be on until tomorrow morning, or this weekend, however.

Totally agree. Really wish I could have a eyebot named ED-E

I was not aware of this. After reading your comment, I tried to find thing information, but was unable to. Do you have a reference or a screenshot of this tip?  The closest I could find was a tip saying that bobblehead buffs were powerful but temporary. 
---
Alliterating pun!

This is how I felt when I first entered the "Savage" Divide. I was expecting for it to well induce some sense of fear and dismay. Instead its just empty and bland.

Sounds better, riding them underground through whole appalachia!

I'm not normally aggressive, but if I see you in game.  You're going to have a bad day :)

No, another settlement does NOT need my help....lol  The last 4 I completely walled in, gave everyone guns, put enough turrets up to take down a SBQ, and they STILL DIED if I didn't show up every single time to save them.  F them, f their settlement, and f you Preston :)
---
Have you tried using the Animal Companion perk card on it? I know the card allows you to "tame" animals and take them back to your C.A.M.P.
---
Few reasons. Location they live, their internet speed are just 2 reasons
---
Your GT same as name here?
---
It is not.
---
I'd suggest not using that perk tbh.
---
Your melee will need that over-repair more than anything else and luck of the draw triggers so infrequently.
---
We can't, but I don't think they check imagelinks. Not sure thou.
---
And to add, if you don't already have the fusion generator plan, do the power up event and there's a good chance you'll get the it.
---
My hats off to all the players roleplaying as hormonal 12 year old kids.  They're spot on.
---
Yep, i was expecting lvl 90 legendary deathclaws.... Got 20s instead
---
Are you for real? I had no idea Eyebots could even be legendary. :u
---
I'm not sure some of them were even choices, it's more like they just dumped a bunch of random ideas in there and hoped for the best.  I've enjoyed a lot of this game, but the PVP and other design aspects have been like a time capsule of how multiplayer games first developed and grew.  Like Bethesda just missed the last 20+ years of multiplayer norms and concepts and is just now figuring out that people will be mean to each other and exploit the easiest ways to do it.
---
Whenever i hear the vertibots approaching i start shooting them first.  Then the cargobot will fly around in circles. Aim for the propellers to make it fly slowly. 
---
It could be done easily, at least from a narrative perspective. (I can‚Äôt speak to the challenge from a coding perspective.) There is no story reason why refugees from other areas couldn‚Äôt show up to Appalachia and settle in at least one town, or a Vault full of NPCs couldn‚Äôt spill out into the world.

 Of course almost no one cares. I do have fun interactions with quite a few people in the game and they care for a minute or two. ;) The 2 guys I spared yesterday cared for a minute or two. I put the exploder away after saving their asses. The game is cake for me.

And they say Customer Support never helps. OP, do what this guy says and simply ask for a refund for rhe atoms.
---
I agree with you but I don't think it's coming anytime soon, mainly because I'm not sure BGS knows how to improve the stability right now. 
---
They had to retool the engine, which has only ever been used to make singleplayer games, for multiplayer. You can watch the NoClip documentary on Fo76 to get some background on how big of a project it was to get this game to work. Online games are a work-in-progress for BGS, they are learning as they go.
---
You saw with the STASH space changes they made a few months ago, they increased the cap and were going to monitor performance to see if they could make further changes. They really have no idea how far they can push systems like this and what impact it will have on the stability. If BGS had all the answers to stability issues, they would have fixed them by now. I am sure they will learn more over time about how each piece of the code affects stability, but I don't think that they know enough right now to "fix" stability.
---
I do not see a single fact in your post, i can not even Google to find jack squat based on your ‚Äùfact‚Äù. More of a claim than a fact then huh?
---
Ppls internet connections are wildly different.
---
Case in point my ps4 is direct to the internet so no cheap/free isp router involved.  
---
I dc less than i crash and i crash rarely.
---
Who the hell takes all 3 plants though.
---
I don't remember where exactly, but I believe you can use some of the tiny tunnels in the cranberry area to lay down a camp. There's also a few places you can easily live in a cave. I've seen both of these examples from a youtuber called OpenWorldGames
---
Dogmeat and this game will be an 80 instead of 59.
---
Began as a priest with the robes, and now that I have my camp in a garage , and with the plans for vault Tec jumpsuit gifted by a random in excavator armour , I am.rping as a mechanic. This is the biggest potential.of the game.imho, roleplay. 
---
Very cool. Thanks for sharing. 
---
It should be ultrasonic. We shouldnt be able to hear it..  A Scorchbeast is just a giant bat..  Seems bethesda never studied biology. 
---
Top kek
---
Yeah. And I wan't a puppy. That doesn't mean that I'm gonna get one. 
---
No one cares. So punch in. 
---
I honestly used to carry at least one screwdriver on my character in Fallout 4 because of this.
---
I am noticing prices on the rise so demand is going up.
---
Of course ppl will blame dupers but the recipes are very cheap. 3 stable fluxes is the main material needed

I don‚Äôt love graham!

Just read the comments i posted the website name. Can send u a direct link on priv even.
---
Not that i care now as i bought it for full price when i came out
---
Cranberry Bog is nice.
---
Your camp is in a garage? 
---
Also if you have people on your team or a 2nd device/account, you both can grab keycards from the same cargobot, I got 3 yesterday from 1 cargobot
---
I knew about the cranberry bog tunnels i found they where too cramped. I'll see if i can find anything on thoses caves. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm sorry, that‚Äôs not true. I do love graham.

Having a pet would be SO COOL!!! OOO and I can dress em up?! Like Doggie or Kitty power armor?!?!? OOOOO!

Whitesprings, west tek.

Basically anywhere with lots of targets.

&gt;Response 2 - FOV Slider
---
&gt;&gt; **FOV Slider:** We haven‚Äôt supported FOV sliders in our previous games as it is known to break a lot of animations and causes a lot of clipping to occur onscreen. You do have the option to zoom out in third person on PC by holding View and moving the mousewheel, but we won‚Äôt be able to have it for first person view. 
---
&gt;As you can see they had zero intention of adding FOV sliders, basically saying we haven't done it in the past, it's hard, and oh btw, here is a workaround to change your FOV for those of you that are getting nauseous playing the game. 
---
They didn't "basically" say any of that. They literally just said that increased FOV causes graphical glitches, which it does, even with the slider. This is what the person you replied to was talking about. Bethesda didn't "basically" say that they didn't want to include an FOV slider because it was "hard", just like we didn't drag Bethesda "kicking and screaming" to put these things in game. This is stupid, unnecessary overdramatization. 
---
&gt;Response 3 - Uncap FPS/Unlock FPS to physics
---
&gt;Oh hey, look at that. One heavily requested feature that people had been asking about from the start is conspicuously not even mentioned at all during their feedback response.
---
&gt;It came a couple of weeks later under immense and constant pressure from posts, articles and the like.
---
Where are all these posts and articles? I know people were upset when they removed the speed hacks and locked the PC FPS to 30, but there wasn't a *ton* of outcry about it. 
---
Do they sell dictionaries that include the word fact in your miracle store that is does exist and is a legit store that does not sell stolen cd keys?
---
Never thought about that lol you're right
---
I can mod it
---
Oh haha it's on the low wall of the gazebo in the game. If you drink from it , it will cure your diseases! 
---
The way chems and buffing items have been in previous games is largely irrelevant. 76 is a new game that makes lots of small changes and there is no reason that Bobbleheads could *not* be stackable. It is hard to say without an official statement what was and wasn't intended.
---
That being said, I respect your opinion that you dislike the stacking mechanic. I disagree, but I would be willing to meet in the middle with some sort of stacking cap.  When people initially found out that Bobbleheads weren't permanent, and the buffs were sort of lackluster, they received a lot of criticism and the argument that they were stackable made for a good counter-argument. It also makes them more worth finding, collecting, trading, and using as they are rare, uncraftable, and potentially more powerful than food or chems. I think that strikes a good balance. The argument could be made that it is possible that they were merely intended to be a little extra bonus on top of food and chem buffs that a player might occasionally enjoy.  I accept that, but I like the stacking mechanic better. 
---
I live right down the road from a zillion GB fios hub and within 20 miles of Bethesda's own HQ.  I still get dc's and bluescreen crashes on my PS4 constantly.  It's like their server farm is on mothership zeta in deep Saturn orbit.
---
lol - i had two i believe i scrapped. I think I have plans to make but not sure.
---
That's my favorite.
---
The Gatling Gun is *supposed* to be a weetern crank-chaingun.
---
Unless you mean a clean skin like the Chrome Minigun, in which case I'm all in for that. Hell, I'd kill for a clean MG42 skin. 
---
I wanna throw in:
---
Additional colors for existing Atom Shop items. If I'm paying 3 or 4 dollars for a dress, I want that dress in more than just one color. Give me some options, there's no reason the Laundered Dress should only come in rose, swapping the color to purple or blue or something shouldn't be that difficult. (Especially when several other colors exist in Fallout 4 already.)
---
And I'd buy that camo PA paintjob set in a heartbeat if there were more than just forest camo. Hell, even if they'd just add urban camo to match the urban Enclave scout armor, I'd be up for it. (although a snow camo would be nice as well, maybe a desert camo too.)
---
(Also, this is more just something I want, but a blue Army Helmet to match that urban scout armor would be cool too. I could toss 50 to 100 Atoms at something like that, if it's only gonna be one color.)
---
Personally I prefer a separate Server system. I wish after they implement their open-PvP servers that they'd remove it from the "normal" servers, but I don't think they will because that causes its own problems. I just prefer to know what I'm getting into when I log on, because I rarely feel like PvP, but when I do I'd love to be able to jump straight into it (which is what their new PvP servers sound like they'll be, although we'll see how they actually implement it lol)
---
I have had occurrences, I have 2 xboxes, same network, 1 disconnects, the other does not, strange but true. However most times both will get booted. One of them could just be sitting idle doing nothing and get disconnected
---
That‚Äôs the joke. I have a reputation among my friends for shit luck. 
---
 I will give this to you. Go to the Station in Watoga and then go west, carefully Assultrons abound, to the train car that's there. In it spawn the plans for all kinds of BOS crap. I have the underarmor plans, all 3 kinds, many time over. I'm on PC myself but that is the place to get em;.
---
How does it currently select which FC to use? I was under the impression that it didn't pick them in an ideal way, and I think in the beginning I observed that, but my recent experience is contradictory. I topped off on cores at a nuke plant recently, so I had quite a few cores at 100%, and then \~10 more between 50-99% that I looked at dumping, but I'm too much of a pack rat. I haven't paid any attention to which cores are actually getting used when one runs out, but I just noticed that I now have 15 100% cores and only 3 cores below that. So it seems my lower % cores are getting used before the 100% ones.
---
Graham is.
---
Then why don't you refer to those for information?
---
well, I guess you don't have to use skins that you don't like
---
Gajatu in with the save!
---
Beautifull.. maybe if they make some game in europe or at least some dlc or expansion, then I can visit those places myself too :D :D
---
I know the feeling. I visited the Ash Heap at level 16 and got decimated. I recommend visiting the Toxic Valley to level up instead. It won‚Äôt be a walk in the park like the Forest, but it‚Äôs a bit easier.
---
I am guessing, like me, you were a Beta Participant. If thats the case, any achievements you got while in Beta didn't count. I had to make a new character to get the first 4 story achievements and Level 10 achievement.
---
You're being paranoid :)
---
I drop things into a bag for newbies all the time.  No problems.
---
I even do a MASS Plans trading event on FO76 Market reddit from time to time.  I drop over 100 plans for other people to try.  Then they do a "take all" and it actually lags you out a bit when you pick up that many.
---

---
So far no problems like that.
---
Yeah somebody nuked whitespring but I didn't go there until after the zone went away. Found some glowing ghouls and went to the club house and a line of eyebots playing their music. I threw a grenade and the first one I saw had caps I was like okay I guess I can look them. Then bam legendaries. Was pretty interesting. Got a bunch of 1 stars like a pipe pistol lol. 
---
I dont know, do you need one? Maybe go ask your travelling merchant if he got one, cause clearly you skipped that lesson in school
---
I get nothing but players role playing as mime artists - deathly silence and players throwing emotes all over the shop :D
---
I actually went to Whitesprings rather late so I‚Äôd agree with this as well.  And my reward was being chased by a Scorchbeast all the way there with only trees for cover
---
 No, I have real world stuff today. Later maybe. 
---
I have chameleon armor pieces. 
---
Yes. You can irradiate vegetables to kill the bacteria on them and they last much longer. 
---
Add: explosive heavy weapons deal no damage on crit. 
---
Tested repeatable with missile launcher, fat man, m76, broadsider. Never tried the auto grenade launcher but I assume it is as well.
---
Also AGL should be treated like the missile launcher and benefit from bear arms weight reduction.
---
Do you have any TSE with weight reduction? Or a good 3rd star? 
---
Shoot it down and lockpick it.    The cargobots only drop their crates for supply drops..
---
Keycard aslo (as far as I know) does not expire
---
I disagree. PvP is something that doesn't really produce anything for you. Sure, maybe the person you kill has junk on them you can take, but there's also the chance that they don't. On top of that, you don't know what junk they have, so there's no guarantee that your efforts will prove beneficial to you. Personally, when I'm playing its to advance some kind self-determined goal, killing other players isn't that goal, so other people trying to get me to fight them is a waste of both of our time. It's definitely a more substantial waste of time than, say, clearing a silo to launch a nuke, completing a quest, building a base, etc. 
---
PvP is not equal compared to those things. If this was COD or Battlefield, it's extraordinarily easy to make the case that PvP is a worthwhile activity; it's often the activity that people bought the game for. It would be inaccurate to state that 100% of FO76's player base bought the game for PvP. I purchased it because it was the next installment of the Fallout franchise, which has included no PvP until this point. 
---
Yeah the combination of having to commit so hard to that color AND the fact that I'm fairly certain it "covers" *all* of your hair (based on the very limited photos) put me off....if I'm using one of the 2 "long" hair styles I'd like some of the strands to still frame my face. I was actually fairly excited when I saw it leaked. :(
---
If the hair thing isn't the case though, please someone let me know!
---
I shoot them down and steal the contents all the time.   Afterwards is says something about being open to combat the owner of the box, but no bounty.

Where can I find Gourds for Cranberry Relish?
---
I find that I sometimes have a tougher time with level 1 or 2 hacks. When I see those 6 or seven letter words in a lvl 3 hack, I don't even need to reset tries or remove bad words. I can usually figure it out quickly. But give me a level one or two and see 10- 4 or 5 letter words that all look the same? I am usually not very fast or efficient...
---
When I relocated my camp this last time it had been up and at build limit for around 30 lvls. I had about 1/4 more capacity after move.  It does not register till u relocate
---
Sounds like an issue with individual network connections.  We stream TV a lot and some nights its fine and once in a while its constant freezes and drops.  On PC you could open a cmd window and ping -n 20 8.8.8.8 and look at the value for lost.  if you are seeing significant packet loss it is the network (could be yours or your providers).  Make sure the drivers for your network interface are current as that is one possible cause.  Not familiar with consoles but there may be a way to check there.
---
Otherwise I‚Äôll buy ammo and stims I can pay in caps or craft you a excavator set 
---
I say you did a better job then Bethesda -cough- 
---
The Commonwealth has suffered more than its fair share of injustices, because of you!
---
Which BoS under armor do you want? Officer(black) Knight (orange and white) or Soldier (would be olive if the colors ever get fixed) I can also sell you the BoS fatigues (urban camo)
---
We larf, but I actually find it kind of annoying that my pompadour wig is colored white when I inspect it but black when I put it on.  This game needs less Elvis and more Thin White Duke.
---
Can not see the link so either it got deleted or it was never there. Send it via priv. I bought the tricential version as pre order but bought 3 normal versions on sale as christmas gifts... 
---
But i am curious about the site so bring it.
---
I'd love to see this.  My OCD really gets to me with half and lower recharged cores :)
---
Cap it at 40 power use and you have me on board (also not a lot of budget space).
---
Knight would be my preference
---
What would you like for it? 
---
I did when I responded to this guys post, I told him how to farm it.
---
Gourds are very scarce theres a few spots in the south part of the forest past the river but im not sure exactly where 
---
I agree that Bethesda needs to fix several PvP issues but there are several steps you can take to prevent harassment.
---
If there are multiple people attacking your base just place you camp again in the same spot and everything is stored. Then take your time and block all the griefers. The ability to block players is Bethesda's standard answer for harassment. 
---
The best thing you can do if you are feeling harassed is not engage.
---
I am a 73 and haven‚Äôt done more than a few side quests and the first few parts of the main. I knew I‚Äôd get burnt out from this game if I went too hard too fast.
---
I had a guy randomly walk up to me and shoot me while i was at a tinkers workbench. I turned around and shot at him while he was looking through a stash box. No idea what he was trying to accomplish there.
---
I don't trade with randoms for specifically this reason.
---
I'm not going to play "guess what you want and guess how much you'll pay for it".
---
Also they seem to always want my end-game gear, and NO I'm not selling it thanks.
---
Yes, it's about percentages and optimizations. By putting 1 point into Adrenaline I can go from needing two hits to kill glowing ones at Whitesprings to only needing 1 hit to put them down. Also, my Furious handmade rifle can take out a level 50 scorchbeast in one drum magazine but if I tried using a regular automatic rifle it would take many more bullets and they would seem very 'bullet spongey.'
---
My GT is MrEMar I will log in now
---
Lol, sure mate.
---
First off thank you for this.  I hope it gets stickied and you keep up on it.
---
Second after the January patch I had some Liberators spawn under the map while trying to take the Billings Homestead workshop.  It was literally called out as fixed but one spawned under the front porch and one under the side porch and I couldn't do anything.  The "usual" fix of trying to Molotov cocktail it didn't work which meant it was so far underground that the Molotov radius didn't hit it.  So it seems their fix needs a bit more fixing or they didn't know it affected that workshop (since they called out the names of some they fixed).  Pretty sure Sunshine Meadows still has a issue too.  Other workshops where I've had underground spawns in the past, like Gorge Junkyard, seem to have been fixed.
---
And my actual response comes. They don't yet have tools built to look at player inventory/edit player inventory so I'm SOL on my gun. So long TSE Gatling Gun! Onm the freeze part though they gave me some instructions around deleting my player data and potentially doing a full reinstall that I am going to try tonight. I guess it could be worse, it could have been my main gun. I only used the gat for the queen.
---
Thanks! I will do üòä
---
Sorry, I guess that was a wall of text!
---
I found them at the Welch RR station.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Fo76+ignition+core+bug

Maybe it's a bug? I've been able to repair loads of other players' camp structures. 
---
I'm guessing the Xmas break was a big reason we haven't heard more
---
I used to go there just for the Black Titanium, until I found out about Mole Miner suit scrap having Black Titanium in it, now I just do the Blackwater mine and Uranium Fever when I need to update armor. In the wild I've only had a couple of Deathclaws cause me grief when I'm breaking weapons mid fight.

My God. That horrendous wallpaper is **real**?

Currently looking for metal building plans, but would also take any shotgun plans or low level legendaries. 
---
I think it was just supposed to mimic the Silver Shroud outfit tbh, be like a new version of that, but ya it kinda sucks sadly
---
You doing the photo poses makes this amazing.
---
Gotta agree, not sure what they are thinking with most that shat, I wont buy it. There are some killer things that I bought with the points I earned like war/Camo paint. Those kinda things fit in the game. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure about the TSE weapons, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm gonna have to talk to my business partner about. We‚Äôll most definitely be able to give stims and ammo for excavator set. 
---
Skyrim iron armor skin for metal armor (and sword skins as well as dawn guard crossbow at that point) :P
---
One thing I loved about the Skyrim Very Special Edition (Alexa one) was that occasionally your quest reward will be a nuka cola.
---
Good to know about the inventory as I'm so used to carrying stuff around like in FO4.
---
Thanks for the advice üòä
---
Cool that your trying to promote your YouTube channel but you're getting a downvote for no Imgur link. I don't want to watch a 10 minute video (or however long it is) to see a face.
---
Red Rocket in Morgantown is a buildable location
---
I can solo it with my explosive shotty in about that time. Literally just run through everything lol
---
That is super weird. I've yet to see anything like that. The only non-standard Eyebot I've seen was a Pied Piper random encounter.
---
That's the new cannon.
---
The game has potential for role play. However, Bethesda didn‚Äôt really make systems that would allow you too. So the majority of people don‚Äôt. I remember seeing posts of people saying they would role play travelling vendors, yet I haven‚Äôt met anyone who actually role plays in the game. Hopefully, Bethesda changes this in a future update.
---
I hate people. The other day I claimed a workshop just to get the event XP, etc. So me and this other random finish the event and he wants to trade. I accept, and while we're in each other's inventories a guy 50 levels above me comes up behind me and owns me. At least give me a chance to defend myself you piece of shit
---
Patrol Duty, run up to the fence around the penitentiary, swap servers if patrol duty doesn't start when you run to the fence,
---
Yeah a big reason for that is because they -really- want you to group up with people and gimping individuals makes it so that you're more likely to group up and not be completely overpowered as a group. Really what should happen is that if you are incredibly specialized you should feel OP as long as you're playing to your strengths, if you party up you take a hit to stat numbers individually but gain more xp/rewards for being partied.
---
Gilded Minigun is black and gold in inspect but black and chrome in hands too :(
---
Is it a beserker's sniper, because that has a damage modifier based on your armor of +/- 50%, and I believe the median point is at 40 armor, over 80 and you deal 50% less, It's by far the worst of all legendary effects in the game.
---
In the sense that it starts small but can spread and go out of control uncontrollably? Absolutely.
---
It‚Äôd be better than it is now. I have like 20 level ups because I don‚Äôt need any other cards. 
---
I got rid of a bunch of shit and ended up losing only 50 from stash and 50 from inventory. It'll soon be replaced by rare shit I need to keep :/
---
Hopefully server doesn't crash and lose everything hidden!
---
Good luck to you and your hunters
---
The need to drop a mini nuke on someone's head "just because I can" ranks  highly on my "needs scale", between eating and drinking. Reasons be damned.
---
One that I didn't see on the list - 
---
In one of the patches, they changed Auto Grenade Launchers so that they no longer benefited from the non-explosive heavy weapons perk cards. This makes sense, except they did this by removing the part that allowed Bear Arms to apply to it (which applies to *all* heavy weapons, including the Fat man, Missile Launcher, and until that patch, the Auto Grenade Launcher). I believe they need to update the AGL to have the same properties as the previously mentioned weapons so that it can again benefit from the Bear Arms perk. (Because it epitomizes heavy weapons... I mean it's a grenade *machine gun*, if that doesn't say overkill, I don't know what does)
---
I think there was a post about how this is a premier trolling weapon since you can heal ghoul packs as other people try to kill them.  Not my sort of thing, but it might be worth a lot to a bored high level jerk.
---
Okay, partner might have metal building plans, not sure if we gave the last of those away already. What level are you? I‚Äôm pretty sure we have some lvl 15 TSE shotguns if you‚Äôd like one. Not sure if we have actual shotgun plans. 
---
I have totally had this happen when logging out with low health and lots of rads.  99% sure it's due to how the loading process works.  I have also had things instantly spawn around me when walking/running down a road and getting clobbered because I hit a trigger spawn point for an encounter.
---
I went to WVU for college, and am dating a WV resident. The amount of enjoyment she gets from watching me play is simply fun. She'll just look up and go "Hm, that looks like Camden Yards" and she gets really excited when I tell her that it is.
---
The game has definitely done a good job of making WV a familiar enough experience that residents of the state can enjoy it
---
Yeah. Wanted it to be like deathclaw sanctuary. Maybe add an unique weapon there 
---
I use west Tek due to exp and legendary drops.  Quality of drops seems to be better than whitesprings I dunno.  Could be confirmation bias but tend to get Max level 3* legendaries there on top of the good exp
---
Yeah I‚Äôve known about West-Tek; It seems better so far for the cap stashes/loot as well as legendaries; not so crowded too. I think I can get 1/3 XP bar per server hop with no XP boosters
---
Better since the last patch :)
---
This is awesome 
---
Thank you so much üòä good to know about the solo perk card. 
---
You been hitting that mutated fern?
---
Is there a certain location that spawns tons of enemies?
---
The character I want it for is under 10 but I'd take that shotgun in a heartbeat. Even trade?

Glitch, another bag related one.
---
If you drop an item to form a bag, step back, open it, and start to drop other items into the bag, and someone else takes that first item while you're still in the bag, you will not know the bag is gone but the bag and everything you put into it will be gone when you stop interacting with it. 
---
They probably have a perk/mutation combo for bonus damage. Perks- Bloody mess is 15%, Adrenaline stacks up to 60% after 6 kills, Nerd Rage gives 15% bonus when below 20% health. Mutations- Adrenal Reaction gives bonus damage based on missing health. Almost everyone runs that one, it‚Äôs negative is -50 max health, which for most people is pretty manageable.

4) Some enemies are still spawning underground for workshop takeover events.  It was in the January patch notes, and you guys did seem to fix some of the workshops, but recently I had a "Claim Billings Homestead" event pop up.  Two of the 5 Liberators spawned under the map, one under the front porch and one under the side porch.  Three others were inside the house and killable.  Couldn't complete the quest and just moved on to something else.  I have also had ghouls spawn underground at Sunshine Meadows.....yellow diamond just floating above nothing. Its almost always one inside a greenhouse, one that goes N-S furthest from the building near the door furthest from the building and one under the junk pile.
---
5) Didn't bother.
---
The springs, westtek, cut throat camps where there are super mutants, watoga.
---
I was told for this one you need to check the spawns in town first, I guess you only get good spawns if it's ghouls or scorched in the town.
---
This is pretty much why Prima is shutting down. Sad, but it makes sense. Nobody needs those guides anymore. 
---
They were auto scrapped for their junk. Always gotta be super careful with loose mods, when repairing a weapon it will have a pop up saying what is broken down to get the materials for it.
---
I have to say this every time an opportunity arises:  We need big burly mountain man beards.

bethesda pls.  i showed u my atoms.
---
I play melee so I like the steeped tea, but what‚Äôs that to do with anything?
---
I'd have a game with ya buddy but I am level 51.
---
Probably got trolled by Bethesda Bugs.  Mods can be consumed with repairing / building items cause they can be scrapped for Steel, etc.
---
Gotta watch out when you have those valuable mods.

I dont have the game, can someone tell me if the presidential retreat is there as well?? Its the house the presidents would stay at when visiting the greenbriar, and my family and I stayed there for a week a few years ago! I will absolutely buy the game if its there, so I can see if they got the inside of it correct.

Mods are consumed for steel. 
---
Bethesda support will tell you there is nothing they can do and to use your mods next time
---
The first story I believe, the second story is missing something. You cant get one shot while in pacifist mode.
---
Have they said what they‚Äôre doing with ongoing online updates since they‚Äôre closing up shop?
---
Depends. Do you mean Edgar Swann or the bird? 
---
Yeah the fact they don't  work together was quite upsetting to me.   Renders luck of the draw useless almost.
---
10 i think maybe 9
---
I got a pump shot gun that fills my HP with like 4 or 5 shots. Game got so much easier after that. 
---
Satire can sometimes be effective at getting people to reflect on their opinions and reconsider, but maybe I do need to spell it out.
---
Why would those of us who *could* see that it was an obviously baseless rumor founded on a negative perception of the game and tenuous evidence from people that have a vested interest in riling up impressionable people to drive clicks be thankful they made a big enough scene that Bethesda themselves had to dismiss it?
---
If you have a right to be upset about a rumor then I have a right to be upset your impressionability was spreading more negativity around a game I enjoy that already has its fair share of *real* problems.
---
Same issue on pc. 
---
I think it would just be better to destroy x perk cards (probably 8-10) in exchange for a perk pack
---
I‚Äôm level 109 and on my **third** master hacker ‚Äòfoil‚Äô
---
What the fuck is that shit
---
You...do realize that these games are based off the 40s and 50s culture right? Hence the fashion, music and general aesthetic.
---
Dont know, but gunsmith + luck of the draw is op af.
---
Astounding.
---
My thanks for sharing the photos, and I hope you enjoyed your trip!
---
good point I never thought of - up vote for ya buddy :)
---
Was not aware it was a rare event. Have seen it up before and may have even done it but can‚Äôt recall. Will keep a eye out for it. 
---
I feel the same way with Rose, she's awesome. 
---
Its per card, 3 rank of 20 pct each. So yes 60 pct total boost. I did the first rank of each type to get 30 pct then slowly filled the other ranks over time.
---
You're lucky. I just had 2 level 50s and a 150 chase me halfway across the forest until I could find a good spot to fast travel. People are dicks.
---
Boston.
---
cool down bro. you aren't making any sense now. eat a snickers
---
I use a vampire plasma gun with flame barrel, so basically a plasma flamer.  It wrecks enemies, but the vampire healing is not that great.  Its also +30% vs scorched which is nice.  I use it for the damage not the healing.
---
It was eating cores to craft other cores
---
I have three different characters with stories, and I am not going to tell all of those stories, but my last one is hunting a group of Vault 76 residents who killed his wife and kids(wanted players).
---
The work around that I'm using right now is to use the walls "inside out" so that the keypad is on the outside. Honestly I think it looks kind of neat, though inside looks a bit different. Reminds me of the Railroad base in FO4 so I don't mind.
---
This is what it looks like:

---
Yeah first time I‚Äôve ever seen it and I now have 269 hours in game. Other poster had over 200 hours too. 
---
From the description you have to use something to force an SB to land and then kill it.
---
Can confirm as a native WV‚Äôian. The Greenbrier is a legitimate 5 star hotel. Very hoity-toity stuff there.
---
all over pretty much. Just walk around points of interest and hit up those pink growth forest patches too.
---
Are the drops supposed to be good? Did it for the first time a few days ago and only got the usual bad stuff, no legendaries, plans, or outfits
---
I did a bit of research, while most of it is in agreement with what you said, one guy said it can. and since I desperately hope it works, I will consider that the truth. /S
---
Thanks for the heads up. I'm still going to test it out since you get luck of the draw 20 levels before weapon artisan. 
---
Ohh dam I didn't know, thanks for the infoüëçüèΩ
---
&gt;Let's face it: Lots of people would spend their hard-earned atoms to have the Silver Shroud costume.
---
And guess how many would spend even more if they were scared it would be gone next week.
---
Lots of people like to min max and otherwise optimize their builds in games. Personally, being able to 'break' games is what I enjoy most about them.
---
Boo
---
Haven't played that in a while... My poor fdl probably misses me.
---
How about the Pimp Boy 3 Billion from FONV?
---
There's a BOS doodad in the area. You activate it and it spawns a flightless SB and scorched mobs. 
---
There's that toxic PvP player comment we were expecting.
---
Don't rage quit bruh.
---
I‚Äôve seen this too and talked to the player afterward. He actually wanted me to kill him to clear his bounty and for the life of me i had a very hard time of it even critting with a double barrel shotty point blank to the head. The life bar goes down to 1% then comes right back up.
---
The assassin sentinel legendary effect combo does this. It‚Äôs so much damage reduction from players that the game might be registering the damage but then refunding the health bar.
---
I don‚Äôt have an explosive weapon but I do know that the fireproof rank 2 + dense or padded chest armor combo eliminates all explosive damage taken so the new imbalanced PvP meta seems to be assassin sentinel legendaries for near immortality. 
---
It's definitely better to do one rank each per card first for the 30%.
---
I'd also suggest if you are playing with builds to have one card one star, one card two stars and one 3 stars so you can play around with perks in that category before committing. 
---
I haven‚Äôt tried, but can you speed up the station chiefs, is that possible? I know your supposed to be able to make new ones if one breaks, but can I run around and spawn them all immediately? 
---
5 tries now. No fusion generator plans. Rng fuckin despises me. I did Poseidon 4x and thunder mountain once so far. 
---
I got the windmill.. so atleast i got that goin for me...
---
I got a Vampires Exploding harpoon gun that I modded with flechetes, absolutely love it. Can damn near 1 shot most scorch beast if you hit them right and keeps me healed while doing it. If I'm low on health I'll just pop a few super mutants with it as well to heal up without using stimpacks. Definitely would say that vampire legendary effects are underrated.
---
There is a small airport in Lewisburg that night be closer. 
---
I agree that turrets need to be a bit more powerful (er, at least the basic ones I've used).   
---
Not sure I want them starting fights with random wastelanders however.
---
lol you gonna give them ideas to start selling everything already out for the same price just in different colors.
---
I don't think you can tbh
---
Same here. I built my main character around crafting. I loved the idea of being able to build a gun from scratch, fully upgrade it with mods that I made, and use the ammo that I crafted. But the fact that legendaries are drop only...it made sense in FO4 because all weapons were world generated (dropped or vended). But for crafting to be legitimate for anyone above level 5, there has to be a reason to choose crafted items over legendaries.
---
I don‚Äôt farm legendaries. I find the concept dull, repetitive, and immersion breaking. I prefer to go to 10+ different locations, fighting enemies along the way to clear them out, all the while picking up useless junk that I will soon turn into a weapon or piece of armor that I will then either use to continue my slaughter of scorched and raiders, or sell/gift to my fellow players. Do I have an issue with Players who farm for legendaries? No. Do i have an issue that there is no alternative to this method? Yes.
---
The perk cards add together rather than multiple together.  This [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0l5i2/psa_for_perk_cards_about_gun_damage/) may help some.  
---
So, presuming you have three ranks in each, then you get +60% damage in total from the three different perks.  The previous two ranks are "rolled" into the third and final rank.  
---
This is why some people who may dip into certain perks (e.g., Tank Killer) will take the first rank of each perk to get +30% for three points and use other perks to increase damage in other ways.
---
Imagine an event where a friendly town of npcs is getting attacked by whatever and you have to help them out. Say you help npcs take over harpers ferry and then you have to protect the town.
---
There's some events like this with robots but the robots do literally nothing. It's nice to have active friendly npcs. 
---
Right?! I went to the ash heap and the game was like you‚Äôre suffering from breathing toxic gas or something like that ‚Ä¶ and then it gave me sludge lung lol
---
Because it is
---
Maybe just like FO76??
---
This is awesome work! And funny that there are no other people in the photos until the last one.
---
Sounds similar, but my first shot actually dropped his HP and it never returned but he wouldn't die.  Also, it wouldn't have been an explosive resistance as the weapon is two shot only, no explosive.
---
What about the other mods that are there that contain steel? Some have been sitting in my stash for weeks &amp; have never been scrapped. 
---
Prioritize doing not only the daily and weekly challenges, but start taking a stab at those basic game challenges. I love having camp items like the modern fireplace, nice doors, succulents and more and you deserve to have them, too!
---
Yea, we‚Äôre just trying to get rid of things at a cheap/fair price. If you‚Äôd like to message me on Xbox I‚Äôll tell you when we‚Äôre ready to trade. 
---
The glade always has a mirelurk queen. I had a legendary spawn once. 
---
Watoga has never ending spawns of bots. 
---
Watoga high school for ghouls
---
Items can get stuck in the aether and lower your camp budget artificially, and over time these things will end up building and limit what you can do, moving your camp can get rid of these allowing you to use more of your budget.
---
The biggest offenders are wires, if you don't manually scrap a wire before you scrap what it's attached to the wire will stay, but not be interactive, and can't be removed, if you've ever tried wiring and rewiring something you could have dozens of these floating around your camp, and all of them take up some small amount of your budget.
---
If you get a day I also suggest heading north to see the Green Bank Observatory. They have a huge radio satellite dish bigger than a football field.
---
And then we need a fur suit and a fancy cane
---
its just a dream in a dream in a dream...
---
Swann from FO4. The behemoth in 76 I'd frail compared to the OG
---
Well dang, your right. I mixed them up in my head. Good catch. 
---
Exactly, I have atoms saved up from playing and thought about getting it but I wasnt even sure what outfit I could wear without it looking dumb.
---
I did buy that castle bed yesterday though. My husband lost it when he came to my camp and saw.
---
And I just want my anti-materiel rifle ;-;
---
That's what they have W00BY for
---
&gt;I bet they are waiting with the good stuff until people spend their earned in game atoms on mediocre items.
---
Ah contraire. My chic and stylish mid century modern chandelier would beg to differ.
---
I have lots of other mods that contain steel, but none of those were scrapped. Only the ones I paid out the ass in caps for &amp; the rare ones that were gifted. 
---
Count yourself lucky, should be easy to get another.
---
Despite the fact that Todd Howard openly acknowledged NV during an interview and FO4 has plenty of references of New Vegas(hell the Atomic Command minigame has you protect New Vegas from 77 bombs which is an actual thing in-canon. You can even see the NV sign.) I don't see FO3 fans bitching about not many references in NV but apparently it's a problem in FO4.
---
And outdone? 3 and 4 sold more than New Vegas and the latter was buggy as shit for months. Maybe in terms of story and player choice it outdoes it fellow modern FO games but for someone like me who wants balanced gameplay in addition to a good story, I still hold that BGS is in no way affected by NV. 
---
Melee enemies will run away if they don't have a viable path to you, so I'm guessing you're jumping up on roofs or fences. If you get back on the ground they will rush you again.
---
/u/jessBethesda Whats up with ITV never being on the same day? Can we even expect one this week... and if so will it have actual info or just the usual "were working on secret stuff that were releasing eventually"?
---
They are, I had some random guy drop me like 50 out of the blue. 
---
Hey, its actually blackwater mine. Someone pointed out that i mixed the two up in my head. Thats my bad. Good luck with your mutations. 
---
100% yes on 1.
---
12.5% yes on 2.  
---
Yeah, there you go.  It's pretty fast and easy to turn it on and off, so I just keep mine on at all times.  If you're going to get one shot by someone with glitched stacked Bobbleheads, it won't matter anyway.  Turn it off for now, then you can turn it on again if you need it.
---
I'm all for this. Duping has made caps meaningless as a currency so the only legitimate way to get items is to be incredibly lucky or have something equivalent to trade (or in other words be incredibly lucky).
---
If it were a "balance by rarity" situation that would be fine but again, duping has made it so that a significant number of people have absolute top-tier items.
---
If only he had an accrued inventory of all the legendaries that all the people on 100 servers sold him in the last 100 days...
---
If you‚Äôd like to message me on Xbox telling me what you want to trade I‚Äôll tell you when we‚Äôre ready. (Won‚Äôt be for awhile) 
---
It's actually a Free States doodad. There's a holotape with Madigan fucking around with one and the Free Staters freak out on him. It's a Scorchbeast lure
---
Truth. Load. Then load again. And then wait for the 3rd load. 
---
I left ark.. which had stupid dc issues.. and still 76 is loading slower and slower. Pretty soon itll be just like fucking ark...
---
Already had chicom bots lay waste to my fields of glue.. and yet got zero warning that camp was under attack. But oh if the lvl 3 noob accidentally unleashes his lvl1 pipe pistol a prompt comes up that my base is under attack!!!  Wtf.. turrets do yer god damn job!!!
---
Cool. I'll send you a friend request when i get on. My username is the same
---
I expect the engine's going to get a lot of fixes and optimization from Fallout 76. I just hope the code's structured well enough that the single-player version can benefit from it.
---
Theres an unmarked bunker in the mire you can build on top of. So you'll be on top of a ton of world item spawns. It's been linked to in the forums here before. Gorgeous spot. 
---
Ok cool lmk
---
I agree with that. I think having some operational settings would be fantastic. Like when you hack into sentry units and can change their targeting info.
---
I don't think it's serviced by any airline you've ever heard of, so YMMV on whether that's a worthwhile option. 
---
I've not had the luck if always pulls my highest core, maybe you don't have any high cores?
---
Not sure I see the glitch...sounds like you dropped the weapon into the bag along with the rest of the stuff and the newbie swiped it.  How am I wrong?
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know never done it, just going by what I read on here from other posters
---
I have one. However it spawned without the cap on my second character. If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôll gladly give it to you. I don‚Äôt really want it.
---
You don't need any perks to repair it you just need the materials required 
---
I'm not sure why so many of the rant posts these days are because they spammed buttons and blame it on the game
---
Kinda makes it so people won't trade for caps though.  Lots advertise trading for other items only. I dont use the Reddit so much as a trading discord but I'd assume it's similar?
---
We need the option to upgrade the lvl of legendary items. 
---
You can.  Use the drill weapon.  
---
You're not wrong, you're just...
---
I'm really surprised there isnt a friendly scorched npc in the game. Weve already seen ghouls and super mutants that have somehow not been completely degenerated. I'd think it would be cool if the virus only partially effected someone. 
---
Because it's easier to blame the game than take personal responsibility.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can give you mine
---
I have seen him twice, once when I was a low level finding the T type fuse, and two in Watoga as a high level. And I agree, he is like the ice cream truck for anyone who plays, he is just so hard to find.
---
They are also using a new lighting system and prob plan to use it later as well. I've personally encountered way to make problem with the lighting such as the contrast of dark and lit areas and also that at a certain height off the ground the lighting is just completely fucked only during mid day. And even it's just lighting and doesn't affect game play it still bothers me a lot.
---
Great thanks I'll add that spot to my rotation... I appreciate your help
---
Glad to hear.
---
How about cloche hat?
---
Each card is worth 20% total, and of not is that you get far more return on investment taking 3 level 1 cards than 1 level 3
---
They multiply each other, so 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2, so you end up with about 1.72 times damage with all three at level 3.
---
this means with three perk points you can get 1.2 for one level three card, or 1.33 for having three separate cards at level 1, 
---
Thanks for pointing that out. Editing now. 
---
Not sure.
---
Maybe making x01 is what dwindled your steel so low.
---
If you are crafting at a station it will show what's being consumed.
---
I scrapped my x01 jetpack doing uranium fever which doesn't actually what it consumes.
---
It's an unpopular game that has reviewed extremely poorly, be prepared you might not enjoy this, it's got a lot wrong with it as a game. People are gonna jump on me for saying that, but it's a relatively bad game. Everyone has their tastes and if you enjoy it that is cool, but don't be super disappointed if this isn't fun. 
---
Try reading some of the terminal entries and notes outloud. It enhanced my experience.... A LOT
---
You're not, but this is a blame Bethesda thread. So find a way to blame them for it.
---
But there is also some telekinesis magic going on, because the lockpicking happens without hands.
---
Mine has increased with every new level. 
---
Last time I wanted a quick level (from 69 to 70) I just mindlessly killed the non-threatening bots at watoga (assuming you did the mayor quest).
---
Combined totals for stacks and categories would be great. Percentages would probably be a little too analytical and stuffy for the UI though
---
She‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôd rather have her then a pile of holotapes, but she‚Äôs kinda annoying 
---
And heavy guns
---
Hahaha this made my day bro lol.  Learn something new every day. I wonder what I don't know xD?
---
Would be neat but i could see viewing your stash causing major slowdowns if its doing all that math.
---
Gunsmith lvl 2
---
Wow what a little douche and you were helping out, why do people do this, he can't even use it .. what platform are you on, I might have an extra one I picked up when someone sold it at a vendor, not sure what level it is, it's probably not a 3 star though .. what a level 4 even know about weapons unless this was an alt account and he liked what he saw ..
---
They will more then likely add some when DLC comes in. I figure they will just have people show up from the west and spin off all new quest lines from them. And at some point we have to either run into the overseer or find her body.
---
It‚Äôs part of the unique charm of fallout. What other game would even have such a weirdo item
---
Yeah I‚Äôm thinking I need to find 4 special points from somewhere. I need two more bloody mess and two more adrenaline then I actually have that set up you describe. 
---
Along with that I need a bloodied super sledge and a two shot bloodied lever action and I will be good to go. 
---
Only problem is finding the extra special points. This is where trying to run a min/max melee/rifle build is a pain in the butt.
---
I've fixed turrets before. 
---
I must‚Äôve gotten lucky. I got it as a reward for completing one of the responders main quests.
---
Yeah, I read this story as "I wasn't paying attention, dropped something important and cannot get it back"
---
Taking the workshop flagged me for pvp, which I recognize was a risk.  I grabbed it to drop a stash and manage some weight because it was the closest "known" quantity.    Not even particularly mad that I got killed over it, though the 150 caps lost is the bulk of a vendor run.  Just was thinking "this adds absolutely nothing to the game for me".  Certainly don't see the PvP aspect when it was one and done.
---
I still pick up legendaries off of normal charred ghouls and such there. Even if there‚Äôs not a nuke I‚Äôll make at least one run through The Whitespring a day. Plenty of steel and other goodies to grab there even without the legendaries.
---
&gt;How about PvP players not be allowed to join in nuke zones?
---
you have been***TOXIC*** from the beginning bro. In a nuke zone, you can't hurt a PvPer. Made no sense. You want your cake and eat it to. You are the toxic one. I am reading all your comments in this thread. You are super salty. I ASSURE YOU I don't need you to launch a nuke for me. Also, good way to keep PvP from happening? Launch a nuke. Will give the PvPers you are talking about (I am in Pacifist 90% of the time) something to do while you rake in those sweet extractors. This is a problem in GTA when someone can turn Pacifist on and off at will. You want that ability. I ain't buying the poop you are selling. You want an easy gaming experience that makes it safe and enjoyable. This is post-apocalyptia. get bent
---
Sorry I can't help you but fuck that quest. 
---
You're correct about the main problem, although no level 4 noob is going to demand somebody's All Rise.  He was giving stuff to somebody's alt or mule more's the pity.
---
Well, Bethesda obviously should patch it so that low level players can't pick up legendary weapons from paper bags, and there should be three popup screens when you try to drop something you like
---
Ok.  Thought so but I don‚Äôt keep track of all the supposed glitches people claim are Bethesda‚Äôs fault.  I kinda wish I had been there to watch him chase the newbie around while begging for his gun back.  That kid is probably planning a whole build around it now.  Or sold it to a vendor for Bobby pin money. ahahahahahah
---
I am currently playing one of the most prolific serial killers in the wasteland ..25+ kills and it grows everyday..this isn‚Äôt simple pvp this is luring them in trapping and killing them..The Music Man stalks these wastes..when you hear any music make sure you are alert cause you just might have been chosen..
---
Just trying to think about how they could improve them. They are a joke as it stands now. 
---
Ok bold capital italicized letters guy.
---
GTA sucks to bruh. Go back to Fortnite.
---
haha was it really a glitch though?  Or just you rushing?
---
Sucks either way for sure but can't blame Beth for that one!
---
But don‚Äôt you think they‚Äôre choosing what to release based on what is selling?
---
Genius.
---
A lot of the security guards at the Greenbrier are really great guys who love to interact with the guests, I‚Äôm sure they would have got a kick if you would have explained to them. But I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed your visit to our little town!
---
*Throws chicken nuggets*  &gt;=O
---
There ARE NPCs
---
While there is some LAG, it's not nearly as bad as it's made out to be, at least not any more.
---
Glitches exist in EVERY game
---
I think the story is pretty good. Honestly it resonates more with me than FO4's
---
Online only does not affect the game at all for me
---
Canvas bag has NOTHING to do with the quality of the game.
---
Gameplay is exactly the same as FO3, NV, FO4, so if you found those boring, then yes, i suppose you would find 76 boring. The only difference is variable dialogue options. 
---
You literally don't even know what you're talking about. You're just parroting the uninformed opinions of others. If you don't want to play it then dont play it, but you have no basis on which to call the game trash. 
---
see, now everything considered, my opinion is actually more valid than yours because i have played it. I've put about 150 hours into it and it is very much a fallout game. I enjoy it, despite the bugs and glitches (that every Bethesda game has), and i don't think it's garbage at all. 
---
Thanks for the clarification, but I feel like a fucking idiot now. However, that's a real dick move on the DEVs part though. Mods should not be catogorized as "Junk" and made to default scrap when short on mats.  That's some bullshit. 
---
There‚Äôs good meat on that cat, kid!

Counterpoint: Having a town full of Grahms would make the OG Grahm less special.

Go to nukacrypt.com it lists all the codes each week.
---
Awesome! 
---
Yeah man I was aware of the reviews before buying, which made sense why it only cost me ¬£20. Not looking for a super serious game just something to kill some time with, been a huge fallout fan since I first played 3 so happily went for this one.
---
Part of the problem is that *so many* carry weight perks are already in strength. Ballistic Ammo, Armor, Explosives, Heavy Guns, and Chems, and I think Melee weapons too but correct me if I'm wrong.
---
So it took you and your mates a while to learn the social dos and don‚Äôts that bear consequences in this particular game. 
---
Like moving to another community try and finding out things you previously thought were ok  are not by copping a fine the first time you do them. 
---
Sure.
---
Congratulations, now you know. 
---
PvP is *meant* to be exactly where it is. Appalachia is *meant* to feel unsafe. The knob won‚Äôt dial to zero risk - that‚Äôs a deliberate design decision driving of how the designers want you to feel there. 
---
At the same time, it does t go higher than mild nuisance, for example nowhere someone could take your irreplaceable items. And it gives good behavior the benefit of first strike, meaning if you play the game well and do your build right and don‚Äôt take risks, you‚Äôll win virtually every right you don‚Äôt start: 
---
So you‚Äôre right about what you said in your title, and that‚Äôs right where it should be. 
---
Yep, this functionality seems to take perverse delight in targeting the expensive stuff first.  I've had a barbed walking cane mod stuck in my stash since release and nothing destroys it, it might be the last item left in the game when it all shuts down.  But if I sneeze on my water purifiers the repair function will eat up some power armor mods to fix them.
---
or at least give us a way to exchange them for something. I've honestly decided to just make several hybrid builds outside of my main melee to see what I like best. I switch between pure melee, melee hybrid explosive rifle (more so for Scorch beasts) and a gather build (lock pick, hacking, pharma, etc.) when I want to go out looting.
---
The place where you get the excavator from, when I was making my excavator, loads of high level scorch and super mutants kept spawn, when someone show up, you get another round.
---
Also the prison should keep you busy both inside and outside.
---
I dunno, its a terrible gun. Both sub-machine guns are. ;)
---
Removing a room in a game is possible, giving you magic powers is not.
---
I‚Äôve shared this before, but following this will make your life much easier. Each area of the game does have certain level suggestions.

---
I mean this without any offense, but I don't think you know what Fallout does.
---
I'd say so, congratz! Some players are creating alts after alts, deleting alts to make new alts, just to try and get some of these outfits. 
---
They're worth quite a bit, so don't let it go for cheap! Dupers didn't get their hands on these. 
---
&gt; Anyone have insight on what's happening behind the scenes here? 
---
If it was all on Bethesda's end, we would probably all be experiencing closer rates of crashes. But we clearly aren't. So two thoughts. 
---
There could be any number of reasons why. As other people have mentioned, location, internet speed. Equipment could be a big factor. I used to have one box that was for internet and wireless. Turned out it was crap, so I got seperate boxes for each. Big improvement. 
---
However, often when you point this out, people get angry and attack you, swearing they never ever have any problem doing anything else via the internet, it's only ever this game.
---
The other factor is this. People exaggerate. One guy claimed he got disconnected 4 times in a minute. We are all playing the same game and we all know that's not possible. You can't get into the game world that fast.
---
Another guy said he was disconnecting every 15 minutes. I wasn't even doubting him, I just said, wow, really? Every 15 minutes. He confessed he exaggerated.
---
One guy said he couldn't keep count of how many times he gets disconnected. But that he once counted and it was 27 times in a couple of hours. Using 2 as what we consider a couple, that would mean a disconnect every 4 minutes 24 seconds. So you sat there for two hours getting into the game, maybe having 1-2 minutes before you got disconnected.
---
Ok maybe a couple hours was there. That would still be a disconnect every 6 minutes 35 seconds. and if he meant 4 hours, that would be every 8 some minutes. 
---
I just really find it hard to believe that someone would literally spend 4 hours trying to play a game that kept crapping out on him every 8 minutes.
---
So yeah, some people are clearly exaggerating the rate at which they get disconnected. Some people probably have crappy internet. Or maybe old hardware. 
---
If your on a console, you probably need to clear your cache now and then.
---
And yeah, there most certainly may be problems on Bethesda's end. 
---

What I am going to do when I find your workshop; take it; kill you; scrap your extractors; use all the resources; and leave the server

You a salty boi
---
What's up with this fortnight looking gear? I want some actual fallout gear. BOS, military uniforms ect. Since it's a survival game and not GTA online. 
---
I have one. If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôll gladly give it to you. I don‚Äôt really want it.
---
Enemies are only bullet sponges if you don‚Äôt have an effective damage build. My vats sniper 1shots most enemies. My HW guy takes 1-10 shots depending on what I‚Äôm fighting, what gun I‚Äôm using, how long I‚Äôve been fighting for (adrenaline) and how low my health is (nerd rage, Adrenal Reaction).
---
You are awesome!
---
It would be funny if there were a bunch of Grahm groupies just following him around the map
---
While scouting for a new camp location I came upon a guy standing at a run down tent in the world. I run up to said tent and there were power armor pieces in it. Of course I snatched what was in it, I assumed he was dumping it. I then get a voice message containing profanity demanding I put the stuff back. Before I could reply or do anything I get another voice message from the guy, calling me a dick, among other things.
---
Moral of the story, you make something available to the server, don't be upset when it gets taken.
---
I kept the stuff by the way. T60 jetpack torso anyone?
---
Did a Bethesda employee tell you that or are you making assumptions?  A single node can only hold 24 players.  They have more than enough people to do all the stress testing they need without putting that on live servers.
---
I was in my notes tab, even if I accidentally swiped by my weapons tab perfect storm wouldn't be near the top. Idk could be, either way I gotta find a new weapon
---
So you are the punisher of vault 76?
---
I'm at the gym now so have your mom make you a hot pockets while you wait for me.
---
BTW just speaking from personal experience it takes a lot of pieces to scrap to get the mods so I hadn't really played with it üëçüèª
---
I believe you do need the whole suit for it to work, even though it does say it only needs the arms. 
---
I tried just the arms, it didn‚Äôt work, I did the whole suit without the helmet, no change, but as soon as I put the helmet on to complete the suit the outputs doubled. 
---
This. You need to craft 1 then drop it and craft another, then drop it, and do that 2 more times. Then you pick up the 3 on the ground and go put them where they go.
---
Very true, sadly.  Just wanted to throw it out there before i forget, ha. Trying to be hopeful their systems improve.
---
The premise of Fallout 76 is that only players are human. It's probably impossible to introduce human NPCs to the game because of that. Maybe in DLC or Expansion we could get them, if even then. I wouldn't mind having them, but the idea seems to be too contradictory.
---
Tell me more.
---
PS4, it's a quest reward, not particularly powerful but I don't like running around with overly powerful weapons. Fights are more fun if they have time to hit back
---
So is this a thing? I have a targeting hud on my main PA as well.
---
You're guaranteed to get a power generator plan that you haven't already learned when doing those Powering Up events. Make sure you actually use the plans you get from them to narrow the options and eventually guarantee yourself the Fusion Generator!
---
Yeah could've been a Bloodied 3 star lever action or something. I'm sure there's a H:Perfect Storm out there somewhere. 
---
Aww I wish I could‚Äôve jumped out then! People were so nice around town, I particularly enjoyed the $2.50 PBR‚Äôs at Route 60 Bar and Grille. 
---
I think I sold one if these to a vendor for 16 caps the other day...
---
Yeah I loved that too
---
I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but with it being online, there was quite a lot of holes in the wikis and other websites, so I thought I‚Äôd be a good idea.
---
You do realize that the franchise is base on 1950s American right? Like... everything in these games is based on Leave it to Beaver land...
---
So unless you plan to maximize damage for a certain gun type, investing more than 1 point per dmg boost card isn‚Äôt necessary. Also, that means that, in terms of versatility, if you are going to max out dmg cards, a Strength build gives the most options since shotguns, 1 and 2 handed melee, and heavy weapons are all tied to it?
---
Melee is OP in this game because it has so many ways to increase dmg, the biggest of which is just putting more points in strength. It would be nice if guns offered that as well. Points in Perception increase rifle dmg, points in Agility increases pistol dmg, Strength for shotguns and heavy guns, etc.
---
Xbox
---
That last part in particular.
---
The only thing that I think Beth can be blamed for is not making it impossible to drop/scrap/sell favorite weapons. Otherwise, in my opinion the "favorite" functionality is kind of useless aside from adding the weapons to your quick-wheel which I find myself rarely using anyways.
---
Really? I thought they were a guaranteed reward. Lol
---
I got it from completing the quest First Things First.
---
They plan on opening up more vaults, adding both a pvp server selection and faction-based pvp. They've mostly just been on damage control so far
---
Something like that. He also likes to grow corn.
---
I get around it by not being a horder.
---
Late game it shifts if you pay attention but ppl need 60 purified water, 40 cans of dog food and 50 stimpaks/radaway plus 4 guns and 1k ammo for each apparantly.
---
Agreed, I laugh at people who run around with a TSE and then claim the game is too easy.
---
Crazy, isn't it? If that's all we're going to get we might as well share the wealth! 
---
r/woosh
---
Take some time to level up and tune your build. Get your perks set up correctly - combo them with legendary abilities of weapons or armor pieces. Some people can get up to 40-50+ STR in their melee builds. If you want to do massive damage with a rifle though, I would either look at the dragon for a brute force approach or go stealth.
---
 this is true, even rushing by the weapons tab perfect storm was neither the heaviest, most valuable or alphabetically first so I don't see how that could've been the weapon that got swiped. I was very deliberately in the notes section before hitting drop. But I was rushing.
---
I'm at the gym bro! Hot Pockets bro! Im really salty bro! Mom insult bro! 
---
I agree; it has enough to keep me liking it. I‚Äôm far from abandoning the franchise, but I think they‚Äôd do well to honor some more of the elements of the classic games.
---
You know, I played Fallout 2 about 5 times over thinking I‚Äôd lost the game cause of the cut scenes showing Arroyo destroyed. I remember sneaking into my brother‚Äôs room and seeing him at the Enclave oil rig.. my mind was fucking blown. There‚Äôs more to this? There‚Äôs a goddamn oil rig? You get there on a tanker?! Each time I had played previously I thought I just lost.
---
But now.. quest markers. Maps telling you precisely what to do and where to go. I‚Äôd like a challenge beyond the fake difficulty of radiation and hunger. Actual strategic difficulty and a way of hiding insanely powerful guns from you aside from ‚Äúyou unlock the next batch with this perk at level 25.‚Äù Fuck, so boring. 
---
I loved Fallout 4. *Loved it.* That is, until I fully upgraded my sniper rifle 1/3rd the way through the game and realized that‚Äôs it.. I will not find a better gun for my character ever, not unless I farm my way through 300 legendary Synth left arms to find one with a two-shot mod. 
---
Anyway. Rant over. I don‚Äôt get how they‚Äôve made Fallout so linear. Skyrim, with all its side quests and long Daedric shrine quests, was so fucking more dynamic and had so much more play time and replayability. 
---
I see you didn't shoot any of the vheciles in a mad attempt to blow them up.
---
I am disappoint.
---
*Shakes head disapprovingly*
---
For real though, that is damn cool and neat you did poses.
---
Unfortunately, mine doesn‚Äôt work.
---
I would have to check, but I'm pretty sure I have at least a few at 90+
---
I'm not but I'm on ps4.
---
I've never seen the same person twice.
---
I still see new players or ppl making alts and rarely see wanted folks anymore.
---
A flaw, that lets you poof out of trouble at any time, on command.  If abused can can very much be described as an exploit. Even nintendo monitors players who have a bad habit of disconnecting from fights. 
---
I'd ask for safe places to disconnect: train stations, vaults, camp,faction? anywhere els there should be a punishment of some sort, lose junk?, debuff?.  
---
The servers themselves are to blame for unintended disconnects at this time, but whenever that is fixed the players server hopping/disconnecting advantage needs to be addressed.
---
I think literally anything they do other than bug fixes (and hell, those too) will help the population of this game. If people aren't playing as much, it's because there is nothing new to do and the existing content has been exhausted. Personally I'm looking forward to a PvP experience, I haven't played in a couple weeks at this point but I'm dying for literally *anything* new. And I'm sure I'm not alone.
---
TIL Bethesda totally shit on the canon that originally stated that Fusion Cores would last centuries.
---
I got one shot bonked on the head while helping a random dude getting over run by ghouls. We had just finished cleaning up the last one and the lvl 150+ guy shows up in his fancy pants power armor and cold cocked me in the back of the head with a super sledge. He didn't even take my junk. I went back and grabbed it. 
---
Nah it‚Äôs all true. Really!
---
No other bobbleheads stack idk why every thread has this misinformed type of comment at the top
---
Absolute garbage...
---
You'd think that this would have been fixed or better yet, never have been an issue to begin with. 
---
Thanks for your feedback though. I'll just have to pay better attention from now on.
---
Was actually a soy boy living in mommies basement insult.
---
Fair point tbh, have to admit I'm kinda in the same boat.
---
This would take the grind away that keeps the game alive... for reference: 
---
Destiny (1) Weapon Reforging
---
Destiny 2 Static weapon rolls pre patch random rolls
---
Fallout 76 dubbing Rare items = nothing to accomplish = boring
---
Other references anyone?
---
I have yet to see anyone other then friends on another server.  So whose anecdotal evidence is greater?
---
yeah bro
---
What if we ended up with an underground (i.e. instanced on it's own server) where robots from the Brotherhood are fighting against robots from the Enclave to obtain some tech or other prize, and players fight on whatever side they want - a PVP dungeon event where you push through the cave towards a central room in the middle. Some players have to hack and pick locks while others provide cover for them.
---
I like the idea of the civil war fort where players can be part of a PVP event, but nobody wants to play that one. I've not yet ever met a single other player there.
---
The machete, and the sacrificial blade mod for it, are a completely different weapon than the Nailer. The Nailer is a cultist sword. The machete is a..... machete. Regardless if it has the sacrificial blade mod installed it or not it is still a machete. And that sacrificial blade mod is also available for purchase randomly from vendors, it is not guaranteed to be available at the Harper's Ferry vendor although it does have a chance of offering it.
---
Also, all BoS combat armor (including non-legendary) says "improves radiation resistance", yet it adds none.
---
I am playing a literal full tank build. Unyielding, dodgy, nerd rage, fireproof, dense, barbarian, serenedipity etc
---
I couldnt kill another playing with my bloodied explosive shotgun, but he did kill me with his explosive shotgun. But my anti armor boxing glove 1 shot him with me using 0 melee perks. The game is fucking weird.
---
Really! This actually works?
---
I heard that a modding team just started making Fallout: London. 
---
He was just trying to report back to HQ.
---
I know it is one if the events that can drop good outfits like the travelling leather coat, but I dont know of anything else
---
Still dealing with this glitch..
---
I'm surprised at the lack of weapons and power armor skins, and some of the ones they actually made for power armor is like WTF were they on when they made them.
---
These are easy monetization items.
---
Sure they might sell a Cloche hat or two to someone, a princess bed or two to someone else, but non toy/joke skins for weapons and power armor will net you hundreds of sales easy.
---
Haven't pulled the trigger because I want a better sledge for it but running around in the clean clown costume and croquette mallet as a cannibal clown going "Huh huh I'm gonna eat you!" to other players.
---
Just got the hunting rifle and combat armor to go around as a hunter in full camo after big game. Gonna try to whisper and say to teams "shhh we're hunting shit heads"
---
Once player vending comes out I'm gonna buy out all the Nuka atom shop items so I can deck out my camp in Nuka products and sell all the special flavors. Gotta start buying out Bubbles ha
---
I had been hoping for a cloch√© hat for my granny character since launch.
---
Though admittedly, I already grew really fond of emulating the look with an adorably iconic fisherman's hat instead. It feels like a rather Fallout-loyal substitute to me.
---
No, I rarely run into other players unless I go to a nuke zone or uranium fever. 99% of the time it's like I'm playing single player anyways, I'm not sure I would even notice fewer people on my server.
---
Evverytime i see a title like Im thinking about the FBI getting all up in arm and ready bust down the door until they read the post itself.
---
Here‚Äôs to hoping they improve in our lifetime though, lol.
---
I when there and found 2 level 30-ish deathxlaw
---
Appreciate the thoughtful response! I cleared my cache about a month ago but it definitely won't hurt to do it again. I'm hardwired on what I think is supposed to be pretty good equipment, but it is telecom-issued, so I'm sure it could be better. 
---
So they didn't touch explosive in the last patch, and as far as this bug I've heard that putting the materials in your inventory or relogging fix the unable to repair part.
---
Very much agree with this.  I adorned my FO4 settlements with anything I could find that indicated my loyalty to the Minutemen.    
---
Once we qualify for BoS in game we should be able to grab anything BoS related from Venture or HQ and put it up in our C.A.M.P.    
---
I suspect they're monetising it with later reveals, AFTER enough time has passed that the 76/76 Atom Rewards are gone.  Because the daily stuff, 50 Atoms a day, won't pay for expensive mats in the Shop.  
---
Everyone's gonna want cool looking BoS armour.  So make that a marquee item later, when people will see the only fast acquisition is a $$$ purchase of atoms.
---
I never tried. I just used all my missiles on it from a distance. 
---
40 caps is a lot at that level lol. He probably had an alt that could use it, should be easy to get something similar or better
---
Nah, I see people selling things for caps all the time.  All depends on the trader.  Like I buy Serum Recipes for 10k pretty regularly.  Some people only want trades for Serum Recipes, some want caps.
---
Not really. Fusion Core Generators probably have tech that increases the lifespan of the fusion core. That‚Äôs why the generators are so big. You couldn‚Äôt have something like that in power armor, and I mean, moving a lot of parts, weight, and making the suit agile would make something like that impossible. Just what I think.
---
I kept it prototype for a while, wasnt really into painting it chrome/silver (standard) as a few other sets are about the same (T-45, non BOS T-60, non Nuka T51) and seeing as originally (at least to my knowledge) theres no in-game secondary for T-45,  i didnt want 45 and 01 to both be the same. 
---
I bought Hot Rodder, and as Ive yet to paint a full set, i decided i was to attempt to be somewhat "different", and i painted just the Helmet and Torso on X01, and left the limbs Prototype. I think it looks pretty sweet üëç
---
Ward was a little hard on the beaver, last night.
---
Try putting all the mats in one place i.e. in your inventory or in your stash. Seems there is a bug when pulling mats from multiple locations.
---
Move some mats into your stash and try again. Have the same issue occasionally, just transfer from char to stash and then try again 
---
Try making sure your materials for repair are all in your stash OR all in your inventory, but not split between them. It seems like it won‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt have enough for the repair in one location. 
---
And the patch that nerfs explosive and two-shot hasn‚Äôt been released yet. 
---
And im all out of ammo lol
---
Well, I'm in late game and kinda disagree, but part of that is build preference (like I have too many guns, because I like the variety of all the goofier heavy guns) and how much you can manage to put in your Stash. I find that latter part to be a big limitation for me, I'd love to only carry the bare minimum (or closer to it at least) but I can't fit my extras in my Stash because it all weighs ten times as much without my carry perks ü§£ brutal for Chem &amp; Ammo stockpiles, especially when it includes Explosive ammo which weighs a buttload
---
solid logic but im not convinced
---
Maybe we should just have them take all the enemies out of the game. Try running away first before crying on the internet. 
---
If you're able to defeat an SBQ, you can get Cores easily enough.  
---
If it's convenience you're after, i.e. not having to run around to get them... well, there's a shit tonne of things like this in this game...
---
It's a weird decision, because Beth did not want to divide the playerbase with DLC's, but decided to do it with PvP "mode".
---
I am one of the few people that likes the way this new PvP sounds, but I don't think it's worth of risk that comes with dividing the playerbase. 
---
Was the Bolivian thing intentional? 
---
Hey, it's not a competition, it's an observation from my point of view only. If yours differs then bully for you, right?
---
There're still glitches when it comes to spamming interface option. The game lets you scrap or drop items you cannot view from the list of inventory in the UI. You'll get a message if you want to drop the glitching item, but there's no way of knowing when, during the button spam, you are prompted to drop unlisted item. Basically, never smash scrap or drop or trade.
---
Pretty much the simplest way to explain it, but I was very much in my notes tab dropping plans and when his friend request popped up I was still in notes as I had to back out of it to hit options. Maybe it's like the thing that can happen at mama dolces where you're dropping veggies and meat flavored soy chunks and that's all that's available you drop when suddenly your executioners combat shotty and the Last Bastion scout p piece show up out of nowhere as an option to drop. 
---
It's a good spot for farming black titanium ore to make the excavator PA though. Built my CAMP on bank opposite from around level 15 to around level 30. Was there a couple of weeks. Camp went out into the water with 4 turrets facing the island. Every time I logged in or returned to camp after a while just swim across til he pops out then swim about halfway back and let the turrets take him out. Managed to get 200+ ore in not a lot of time whilst getting to level 25.. Plus there's plenty of ammo that spawns on the far side too. Very good farming spot in the lower levels. Also used to take the workshop near it and farmed the junk pile for screws , gears etc. So all ready when you hit lvl 25 and want to make the excavator PA. üëç
---
nocturnal wood, however, has a thousand uses.
---
DAGS! D'ya like dags?
---
I personally don't think it'll create too much division, unless they require people re-roll PvP specific characters (which I would find largely pointless considering how little impact PvP has on just about everything). if people have the freedom to play on either server, I'm sure plenty of people will spend some time on each server type. I know I will. 
---
A few people on a subreddit being upset about this week's Atom Shop items apparently = Bethesda Game Studios is disconnected from their entire playerbase I guess. 
---
Seriously, they're the ones who see the sales metrics. Call me crazy, but I feel like they know what people are buying. 
---
Plus, all these items are already in the game. There hasn't really been a new download for more Atom Shop stuff. All the stuff that's been added to the shop has been in game files since the beginning. Maybe we should let them work through all the stuff they have made before demanding they make new stuff?
---
Killed 4 legendaries yesterday.  Two with literally nothing, other two I got a silver spoon and some other piece of junk.
---
Yup, I've only gotten the responder outfit from the three times I've done the responder quests. And a responder police uniform. 
---
From the trading subs, I've seen folk offering tse weapons and very good armor for these rare outfits. Cap wise, I'm not entirely sure how much they run. 
---
Of course you disagree. You justify hoarding lol.
---
Did you drink from the sulfur water fountain to remove any diseases?
---
 ***You don't even need to power up the nuke plants, just drop a generator next to the processor.*** 
---
You know they take 100 energy, right?  It's not just a generator, but if you use the 10 from an unpowered plant, you need... 9 more...
---
They're just rolling out shit that's been there since BETA. They're house items. Also leave the cool ass light out of it. &gt;:( Only reason I don't have it is cause I spent all my Atoms on PA paints and the Old Possum sign lol. T\_T 
---
And although I'm one of the players who couldn't care less about PvP (I actively avoid it most of the time), I agree that the decision to split in this way is just odd.
---
Listening to the forums is a good thing, but we're only a tiny percentage of the players.
---
Wondering if they have gone off half-cocked on this one.
---
You should make as an actual product just imagine everyone in the world wearing one we can know what sicknesses we have or what is going on in rest of the body just imagine the possibilities. Your like Elon Musk but for video games top notch would get one for myself. üëç
---
If I'm not mistaken, all the power plants can produce 1 per hour. The tooltips were never updated. 
---
When it runs out, the system will load a 100% if you have it, then down to the lowest.  It doesn't matter to me, as the exchange is done automatically.  
---
I'd bet money they did it on purpose. They're classified with junk, and I believe they get eaten before bulk junk does. And it seems to consume the most valuable mods first. In some of the repairs, it just shows how much you have available, not where it comes from, like in crafting. I lost some T-60 mods I'd been saving that way.
---
Very nice! Thanks for the tip for the Power Armor station. I racked my brain trying to get it to work until I gave up and used the second variant.
---
They should just fix their UI. It's buggy af and can only handle like 1 action request per second.
---
That‚Äôs pretty odd. It definitely feels like something is off but it‚Äôs hard to tell exactly what it is.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sturdy with 5 assassins pieces plus a lot of damage resist perks, but my health bar steadily declines in any fights.
---
Anyone tried nuking death claw island yet?
---
While this is true, I'm just saying I started in the notes tab dropping plans and ended in the notes tab before I backed out, at the steady rate I was hitting drop it should've dropped far more than one weapon had I accidentally hit that bumper, for that matter how did no addictol or antibiotics end up in there cause I would've had to have passed the aid tab, and once again I was clicking fairly quick so something should've dropped. 
---
Doesn't matter! Bethesda doesn't give a shit if the lore makes sense or not haha
---
Well, ya, it reflects how I've played Fallout (and other RPGs) for years ü§∑ I've gotten a lot better about it with 76 but it's still hard when there's a lot of items I use constantly (chems, ammo, my guns, etc.) and so many of the perks to carry them are in the same stat as my actual weapon dmg perks. 
---
But yup, I'm open about having too many chems etc. on my character, boom, ya got me. I'm just saying "late-game" isn't the same for everyone.
---
.. Or simply don‚Äôt know how to correctly manage their pacifist mode yet .
---
No shame in running.....
---
How exactly is it a "named weapon"?  Because it's called "Dragon" and not "Quad-barrelled Black Powder Rifle"? By that logic though, a standard "Lead Pipe" is a named weapon because it's not called "Metal Board". Or how about "Ski Sword"? That one's named too, right?
---
Point is that the Dragon is a standard weapon with no legendary affixes on it. It is also a very common weapon regardless whether you find them often or not, and some vendors even sell them! The only time you'll ever find an actual legendary "named" item on a vendor is if another player sold it to them. Perfect Storm, however, is a named weapon. That thing is a 10mm submachine gun with a unique name.... therefore, it's "named"!
---
Ok PS4 but much appreciated
---
There's more than a few legendary effects I wish we got more info on. There was a big post about it for FO4. However they nerfed most of them from FO4 but left 2 shot and explosive alone?? But anyway if anyone could explain the damage bonuses for each effect like Junkie's and Berserker, Furious etc that would be cool

I do this to my own cow while shoveling shit. They also seem to hurt themselves occasionally and I'm done repairing it until I actually need more. My cow is 3 stories up, locked away in a corner, until she clips through a wall. 
---
Dude, that's where I am, great spot!!
---
OMG! I have just been having this same conundrum with my leather armor. I found some nice heavy leather legs left and right, proceeded to mod them to my liking and they have lost any and all designations as to what type they are now, we have to I think just go my the stats.
---
What a weird departure from Fallout 4, keeps us guessing and living in our inventories puzzling most of the time. I bet it is because of the horrible UI that truncates the long descriptions that we end up when adding mods to items, so they just removed some descriptors to shorten the lines a bit andf make them fit, though they still get cut of on my menus, so it didn't work really. Why not smaller text and perhaps horror of horrors two line per item, we could then get good descriptions and would just need to scroll a bit more.
---
Maybe a prefix. H S L ? Heavy Sturdy Light etc
---
As I said, horrible clunky UI.
---
Dread it, run from it, Scorchedbeast arrives all the same.
---
i bet this stuff could be datamined
---
All they have to do is ban Legendaries from the PvP mode. Just have it based on perks and plans. No need to reroll. 
---
Lol I love this form of wit.
---
I am a hoarder too. But i also understand that the more you can store, the less you have to go scavenging on a regular basis, which is exactly what bethesda wants you to do because once you have everything, there is no more reason to play the game.
---
How do people get enough budget to do this?  I build crafting stations, bed on a platform, two turrets and a couple blackberry plants and I'm toast.
---
 And I being a Bethesda fan should've totally known better lol
---
So to be clear, you know factually that there's no reason at all to have that room in there?
---
Devs definitely use it for... testing... anything?
---
Yeah I guess it's mostly with gear I see that, but again I don't look at the Reddit much, maybe I should.  Then again I don't trade much now a day's either lol.  
---
True, it has to be in the esm somwhere right?
---
Love it, I'll keep an eye out for you.
---
I need the money. I am struggling. That's such a kind offer! I'm sure it's still open, since the OP passed, right?
---
At the Monorail elevator location, just due west of the Cranberry Bog, there is a small open door you can get in to a few hundred feet up, and it is considered a buildable location. It's just big enough for all of the necessities, however, there seems to be an issue with spawning in the room itself. About 50% of the time, I spawn below the part of the elevator that I am on. The part with this door in it is kind of stand alone, it actually may just be part of the monorail, and not part of the elevator, you have to tight rope across the monorail to get to it, and marsupial may be necessary to get to this location.
---
This has happened to me. I would drop a bunch of items quickly but a weapon or armor would drop. It sucks but I learned to drop items less or use the trade system.
---
This, most definitely! Don't discredit the hard work, it is actually worth it. Work on it little by little. I did the same thing after I realized what changes I wanted to make. Now I have \~20 level-ups that I have in waiting unused as I've made my special point changes and acquired the perk cards I want. It's on occasion that I spend a few points here and there to get cards that I have overlooked or hadn't previously found useful. It's not that taxing of an effort and in the long run it forces you to learn more about your character, play style and what you really want out of the build. Initially I was of the same mind as you - give me a quick respec or maybe I'd start a new character, but neither of these would have allowed me to learn as much about my character, my playstyle and the game mechanics as working to correct my errors.
---
Put it on and look at the tooltip again?
---
Good by me. The craftable legendaries mod was one of my favorites for FO4, coupled with never buying any legendaries.
---
My thoughts exactly. Rose is also not a not, just FYI.
---
That slideshow of you recreating your character's poses is my favorite thing on the internet today.
---
Yep.  I reported it a few days ago.
---
You can dress up like part 2 Jason. Sack mask and steel worker overalls or whatever it's called that is a blue flannel with overalls.
---
lol you know they would not read the post.  they would just go for it.
---
Doesn't show the type differences just a truncated descriptor, with X inspect (PC) there is a whole god damned screen to fill with what the bloody item is but we get a generic image and the same shortened description, it's daft.
---
&gt;I'm forced into power armor and tse weapons because of the unbalanced nature of legends as they are now
---
You mean for pvp? yeah pvp pretty well and truly broken.
---
Definitely posted it that way, but currently not my intention now that I'm not so mad at the situation... well more so just a crippling sense of disappointment. Honestly though just means I'm gonna have to farm a little harder for better weapons. I'm always trying to switch up my play style, it's just usually my choice to do so lol
---
I bought the cloche (no accent; it's just "bell" in French) immediately because I play Fashion Fallout...
---
...but it makes you look bald, so they failed with the fashionista crowd, too.
---
Naaah, they cant copy it from previous game. The game is one big duplication: skins from seen game, robots duplicating, CAMP items duplicating, even players duplicate!
---
Or you get lucky when they hide behind a tree that's waaaaay too small for them.
---
They got this so right, but then turned around and got Harper's Ferry so wrong.
---
I was so sad to NOT see this when I finally reached Harper's Ferry:
---
https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/113120603_medium_1497130602.jpg
---
Your intuition is sound.
---
I guess it's good starting gear to hand me down to new toons? But since they're level 1 they'll be outgrown so fast. Seem kind of worthless. Maybe collectors? 
---
Yeah add me on Facebook I can send there.  Justin Gurczynski
---
Yeah, she can feel a bit forced. Like a nice person RPing a raider.
---
No problem! I wish you the best of luck.
---
Ah, good man! That's not the result I *wanted* from your experiment, but I appreciate you confirming it.
---
I did that, obviously. ;)
---
When the location name popped, memories of Deathclaw Sanctuary and Quarry Junction popped in my mind!  I immediately dropped in to a crouch and my head was on a swivel.  I cursed that the fabled plans of the dart gun had not made it to Appalachia yet.  
---
Then:  "This is it?"
---
Yeah it's a loot drop
---
If we can synthesize a scorched cure of some sort, it would be interesting and unique to see the scorched remember who they were and function as npcs within the game. They would have their own unique problems like protecting against personification or needing ultracite to live. All would be interesting.
---
You can stack concrete foundations. The technique works on console as well. This enables you to make concrete bunkers which can‚Äôt be destroyed. Don‚Äôt make a door. Remove a piece to enter and exit. 
---
There are videos up showing how. Cliff notes version is that concrete foundations can be built in and snap to any space occupied by concrete steps. Combine this with temporary half height posts and you can build the multiple levels. 
---
Thanks. 
---
Based on...?
---
\&gt; I ask a civil question I get downvoted   
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Motion-assist\_servos](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Motion-assist_servos)  
---
Look at that. Using the exact text of your title, the 2nd search result. You could have typed it into google instead of making a reddit post
---
I mean even level 1 legendary gear can last for a few levels if it's got a useful enough effect on it. I doubt anything will do enough damage (in starting areas) that the lower defenses would outweigh the usefulness of the effect. 
---
That's not entirely true, 'cause I've seen BOS pieces with added radiation and a Bolstering +25 Rad piece I had and was bugged out previously, did eventually show the +25 RR:  
---
\- [https://i.imgur.com/1NptnpH.png](https://i.imgur.com/1NptnpH.png)   
---
Non Legendary Combat (BOS included) doesn't have any inherent rad resist, so that would be correct, that it's not showing there.  
---
I disagree. Maybe you can make it so that pacifist players do not appear on the map, giving them the ability to hide better? Then again, I want that option for the more stealthy players, too. 
---
Or when scorched hide behind a small obstacle that they think is a wall.
---
Well done!
---
Approaching the situation with hostility never helps either. We're playing in a wasteland full of people who would do exactly that to get ahead. I can't necessarily blame the guy. Sent him some messages explaining that it was an accident/glitch and hoped he'd be the empathic kind butttt what can you do. Especially if he couldn't hear me over voice chat then  I'm just a nuisance following him around spamming trade 
---
You're wrong. I've personally seen people stack heavy weapons bobbleheads. Is it a bug or exploit? I guess, but I thought the explosive stack one was too.
---
Is it bad that I forgot this was a thing?
---
üòÇ
---
Thought this was fixed last patch? it fixed for my friend and I on PC
---
One was a zealot pipe pistol ü§£ or knife. I forget which. 
---
It's a clean outfit
---
I hope so. I just have some bad experience with The Divisions DLC's which divided it's playerbase. 
---
I hate the site is nuked but the flowers aren't. I'm trying to amass violet and cobalt! 
---
No they didn't I tested every bobblehead using 10 of each try it yourself don't watch someone do it
---
The most recent patch started this for targeting HUD and possibly recon sensors. It also seems to give targeting HUD to teammates. It's really bad a few seconds after loading and especially bad in watoga and nuked zones. I haven't crashed a single time since I swapped out targeting HUD 
---
When I toured the bunker, like 20 years ago... Ugh, they still kept it stocked. 
---
That doesn't mean that there won't be stuff like that added to the game at some point, it just won't be going into the Atomic Shop. At least, according to Bethesda. I don't remember exactly where but at one point they claimed that the Atomic Shop was only going to be cosmetic items, nothing to give people an edge in or out of combat since the Atomic Shop items can be purchased with real money. One of the few smart things they've done--limiting "pay to win" to people selling their legendary items on ebay.
---
Didn't at one point they said the stuff in shop can be earned in game.
---
(Don't quote me.)
---
So I just assume the Shop is a time saver shop.
---
There just so you don't have to go out looking for it.
---
No its not, it still has the rags and little dirt spots
---
I find it's a pretty fun thing to do.  Trying to get good deals, haggling over items, finding a "steal of a deal".
---
I've had a few trades where I was like "holy cow, no way that guy sold me X item or plan for Y amount of caps, that's so one sided in my favor".....lol
---
Plus you get better gear, guns, crafting recipes, etc in the process :)
---
Well that sounds pretty useful since a lot of early enemies are scorched! 
---
It's a fair concern, I think. Hopefully Bethesda has taken it into consideration so they implement it correctly. 
---
Duper say would synth
---
On PC it has . on Xbox I was told it did but didn't have to DL anything that I knew so yeah ... that makes so much more sense.
---
Also update for all , I had all items in inventory. Also STASH . It's only 4, 4, 6 not much mats.   
---
I'll check again in a bit. Thank you for the ideas!
---
Her voice is like a brillo pad to my ears
---
The only difference is that the one in the Atom Shop clean.
---
Yeah! Especially by the farm south of vault 76! 
---
But that's why I liked it lol. Between that and my Zealous Sledgehammer with 40% swing speed I ate Scorchbeasts for lunch without it losing the essence of being a fight. I found that there's a "power band" that is optimal for me to play at and it involves not killing everything super fast
---
More duper heads need to roll.
---
Holy fucking shit. That indoor shopping mall. 
---
I honestly don't think I could even sleep at that place now. 
---
Imagine if they added a termite creature that can go through wood armor and wood structures that would be immersive.
---
That was a flag pole with an eagle, this is the congressional mace.
---
Did you go to the clubhouse and smash everyones head in?
---
I had no clue. Thanks for the info.
---
Once the bombs fall, it's everyone's nuke zone.  #FreeRealEstate
---
Not seeing that exact name pop up.
---
Which one
---
While we are at it we should be able to build infrastructure and rebuild the entire country.
---
I really dislike the fact that we can build highly advanced technology like fusion generators, decontamination arches, industrial water purifiers, etc.
---
Sure vault 76 was apparently populated with people who were great in their fields and excelled but we are 25 years removed from a nuclear apocalypse and the entire country is dead, with no industry, no manufacturing, no anything.
---
It‚Äôs called the wasteland for a reason, because it‚Äôs hellish and the world doesn‚Äôt start to recover any form of civilisation for decades yet.
---
I‚Äôm all for salvaging technology and repairing existing technology with said salvaged parts...but if the brotherhood couldn‚Äôt do it why should we able to?
---
Lol buddy, idc what you say or think, it fucking happened and I've seen it. That's a fact and you can accept that or reject it like some sort of bobblehead flat earther.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since master system II, and now that I have kids of my own it‚Äôs so much fun to play with them 
---
Thabk you
---
A vault supposed to be opening up soon. Maybe there's a hooman in there. Or even a nonferal ghoul? 
---
 Spoiler 
---
There was already record of nonferal ghouls prior to vault 76 opening. 
---
It doesn't work with any of them but explosive lol
---
Not really, it still has the rags and dark spots
---
Play something else for a while, then come back and mess with a new character. 
---
I seem to get a lot of leather pieces as well for some reason. 
---
And I definitely can't tell you you're wrong my friend! I think that feature is definitely a must for a future update
---
You've got a point
---
Sorry, didnt specify. Your first point about fast traveling into foundations
---
What are the materials?
---
heh, maybe not! :)
---
That would be a great addition for explorers.  
---
In Far Cry 5 if you find all of the vinyl crates, a new radio station unlocks.  It would be fun to hunt music holotapes that could unlock a new station or add to the playlist on an automated one you need to seek out.
---
Side note, finding all of the cisterns in FO3 was one of my favorite side activities.  I used to get so exited when I saw a new radio tower in the distance, I'd beeline for it to activate the signal!
---
That‚Äôs nice.  Try moving that to a trade group
---
Pretty solid analysis of how todays outrage culture works üëå
---
I'd pay Atoms for a Firecap preserving cooler.
---
Uh-mazing!
---
I m being disconnected from the servers for the past 10 minutes, is this related to some dupe exploits ?
---
It's possible to one shot without cheating. If you have an explosive gun and have all the perks for the gun and explosive damage and other things that add bonuses, it's very easy to one shot
---
It sounds way better than it actually is--the Furious buff is reset the moment you attack/shoot and do *not* hit the target you're currently stacking on. The stacks are reset the moment you hit another enemy, and also the moment you *MISS* a swing/shot. The bonus also has a limit, at some point it will stop adding more damage even if you are somehow able to land *all* of your attacks on the same enemy without touching anything else or missing. Furious is one of the shittiest legendary effects in the game right now. Two Shot, Bloodied, Explosive, and swing speed for melee weapons are all much much much better.
---
*Cleaner
---
Fine, if that's what you want to believe, then go for it. The earth is also flat and I have some prime real estate to sell you... Just because you didn't get something to work doesn't mean someone else hasn't figured out an exploit to make it work.
---
Or perhaps that level 20 is someone‚Äôs alt/mule. Or they found it by unknown origin. I have an alt with a few thousand raw materials of various types transferred from my main. That alt is level 2. 
---
I have however this subreddit has a substantially higher amount of subscribers and I didnt see any rules agains posting here.
---
You know 2 or 3 subs exist for this shit solely
---
I have a 3 star Armor penetrating walking cane I kept, modded with barbed wire, and use all the time now.  YOU KIDS GET OFF MY D@MN LAWN!
---
How do you know the DC is attributable to duping?  Assumption or are you seeing the happen firsthand?
---
Am I the only one that has had friendly co-op experiences with randos whilst defending workshops? 
---
Probably, u know for sure if you can get right back into the same one after a dc
---
First time I went was later in game. Figured you know... they hid a terror spot in a low level area. Explored it and same response, "that was it?" No underground bunker with a nest. No mother deathclaw. Just a lonely low level baddie who barely noticed me and discentegrated to pink mist. 
---
Yeah PvP is always difficult to manage I think. I am late to another online only game - 'The Division' and there they have the PvP zone and the PvE zone.
---
Depending on my mood I may enter the PvP zone and know the risks associated with it. Having started late my experience with this model is different that early adopters of that game. Going back in time on youtube in regards to 'The Division' paints a picture not that much different to the one we have in FO76 at the moment.
---
PvP &amp; PvE will mature over time but if it follows the trajectory of 'The Division' it will be months of work maybe even a year or 2 to get it balanced just right.
---
Interesting. Yeah I see the same ppl all the time when I play. I‚Äôm on pc however
---
It's hilarious that I've done it and you haven't and you're instructing me. Your buddy used explosive and pretended the damage increase was from heavy bobble
---
Legendary glowing diseased deathclaw matriarch pls
---
ü§£
---
It's so wonderful
---
I am level 32 and my pal is level 50. His camp is larger than mine. I would say that the level does effect the camp budget size. 
---
Ok, you live your beliefs.
---
You could buy the weapon from players pretty cheap or level an alt, but anyways, I can relate to that. Lost some valuable items before too because of that.
---
Lotro did the same. You also needed to farm XP to do the rerolls. Would support this idea :)
---
Yeah but i keep being disconnected
---
Cause you can join right back to the sever unlike it going down like normal
---
Your right and I get what you are saying. I do take the outrage with a grain of salt when I watch him. Your example is a bit funny for me though because enemies still t-pose for me a lot.
---
I swapped out my targeting HUD last night and did not crash.  I will be running nuke zones tonight to see what happens.  Normally I can't make a Whitesprings loop without crashing.
---
Nope. How are you this fucking dense?
---
This is too freakin cool!!
---
Fight or flight.  Crying is a crappy way to handle life outside of the vault
---
I'll double check tonight but pretty sure I got stuck 2 days ago. It's not a huge issue tho. 
---
I have had this happen op. When dropping junk quickly, and from the junk tab, it dropped my calibrated power armor leg into the bag. On xbox.
---
My wife has dropped 3 legs and a power armor helmet because of this and my friend lost his shotgun. I tell everyone to check their bag as soon as they finish for anything they didnt want to drop.
---
Then they keep duplicating
---
"VATS will activate and "Strobe" preventing normal operation and remains locked until original target is killed. "
---
I can confirm it happening too. The only way I have been able to stop it consistently is to look straight down so V.A.T.S. resets.
---
A few things change when you get some key perk cards... white knight will seriously change your life. You can get to actually make some progress instead of constant repair and scavenging for parts. Starched genes locks in your mutations, and boy does that change your perspective with a couple of nice mutations to work with.
---
Dude why not a quest line. Or randomly, as part of a quest line,  you see a stinky wet old dog wining and you can choose to feed it or not. If you feed it, he follows you. You can dismiss him any time, or send to camp. Buy new skins in atom store. If you dont feed him, you dont get him.  Theres plenty of ways it could make some sense. 
---
IDK why you're being such a baby about it man I'm just telling you a fact.
---
But have you ever rode the roller coaster at Primm? It‚Äôs a wild ride
---
My grandparents took us on a trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles and at the time, I wasn‚Äôt aware that Bethesda used real world locations and I FREAKED when I saw primm and a big roller coaster surrounding the entire town. It is not wooden however. V fun.
---
i will give u mine for free if u on ps4
---
You think that's bad, the different types of sugar bombs can't all be used for recipes. I have to find sugar bombs that have the right amount of dirt on the box. Something that isn't even textually displayed anywhere.
---
&gt;show up out of nowhere
---
Fyi to that. If you are hit in combat, your UI goes fucking haywire. Will throw random selections of items on a transfer
---
Also if things are spammed for ‚Äòrequest‚Äô in trade, it‚Äôll move all your items around when you‚Äôre setting prices
---
Same for if people are buying more than one thing. If you hear the cha-ching, stop and restart setting the item price, or it‚Äôll put the wrong thing up
---
I certainly hope they‚Äôre learning something, I‚Äôm happy to play this game in hopes they can make the improvements the passionate and loyal fan base deserves. 
---
I ran across a camp near Watago a few nights ago and used the guys stash box. There was a bag on the floor full of junk so I picked it up. Get a message from the owner asking if I picked the stuff up and if he could have it back. Of course I gave it back. Then he invites me to a party and there were 4 or 5 other people there, as cool as can be. Been playing with these guys the past few nights now. Greed is a terrible thing.
---
no, its the clean version.
---
It hasn‚Äôt dropped on PC yet. They announced they were doing it last Thursday but we haven‚Äôt gotten an update since.  
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/7hpeHkKxyM6aMWUCCIkeW6/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-10-2019
---
Yeah I've done that--repairing any melee weapon beyond 100% increases its damage, and it *REALLY* increases the damage on both the Chainsaw and the Ripper. The Chainsaw's damage goes from like 2 to 36, while the Ripper goes from like 5 to 60.
---
But both are still terrible compared to other weapons. I still stand by my statement that the Flaming Chainsaw is one of the coolest-*looking* weapons in the game though.
---
added and great point!
---
&gt;Didn't at one point they said the stuff in shop can be earned in game
---
That was in reference to the currency (atoms)
---
I don't get people that buy this stuff.  It's all out there,  free for the taking.  
---
I need bleach for my eyes now.
---
Wrong, remember Jacobstown? One of my favorite areas in any fallout. Super mutants aren‚Äôt all the same. 
---
I'm just telling you a fact, how am I being a baby about that?
---
Would love to join if possible! 
---
People are lazy.
---
You can sue whoever you want, the judge will just throw the case out.
---
Yes please and thanks!
---
Seems to be a unique mod
---
How interesting. 
---
Sure. But you prob won't win.
---
Guh, that is so disappointing...what a miss.
---
I refuse to wear anything that makes my character look completely bald where she shouldn't, this could have been so cute...I know it's more effort on their part to essentially develop multiple models, but for a limited time paid item? :(
---
I mean, yeah, that would be nice but they are actively trying to make it harder to get cores. I doubt they will do anything to make it easier.
---
https://imgur.com/a/SEvnYHa
---
Oh also do Mistress of Mystery. Good xp, fun storyline, and the gear is upgradeable if you get it low lvl you can upgrade it to 45 as you lvl up!
---
judge won't even hear the case.
---
Thank you kindly. :)
---
Hopefully with people stuffed crust and extra fingers on top. 
---
The legs aren't torn
---
You might want to start your case without the hyperbole though.
---
Prob not.
---
Unrelated to that, I wasn't taking damage, but didn't know it at when I first arrived at Watoga. Was getting hounded by robots. But I was getting hit repeatedly by something else. I thought at the time it might be a cloaked assaultron, but they usually taunt you while killing you. 
---
I was lobbing grenades around, trying to spot the hidden enemy, while battling the ones I *could* see. 
---
After a retreat into a bog ditch and distancing myself a bit, I looked at the map and pieced together that one or more players were perched - most likely on rooftops - and entertaining themselves at my expense. 
---
No actual damage from the players, but probably more damage from the swarming robots because of the distraction. 
---
I'd buy that skin though, and hope they decide to launch more charismatic atom shop items.
---
Please do, come back with your results.
---
Between the main entrance and the little fort-gate thing, there is a crate with some weights and cannonballs. There are also a couple more weights and cannonballs next to the mannequins close to the box (a bit of target practice or bowling game or something for the mutants there). If you were able to scrap ammo, those cannonballs should be a great source of lead
---
I bought it to play with friends, and got my value out of it(+600hr). I feel bad for the chumps who payed for whatever version, even the ‚Ç¨10 variant, played for twenty minutes quit, and cried on reddit/blogs about it.
---
 This game was, so far exactly what I expected in gameplay, one of the biggest gripes I had will be resolved with the pvp servers. I'm strongly against storybook games giving up on fo4 in less than a day,  and thrive on **player interactions**. Yea the bots are boring the game is repetitive, but the **players are what make the game interesting.** Well into the beta I knew this game was for me. 
---
The fo community has been more of an echo chamber, asking for easy mode, god mode,infinite stash, and generally everything that made it like previous fallouts... But this is not that kind of fallout, which Is the main reasons I would embrace a more refreshing player base be introduced. (Que the fo76 hate-train/bandwagon)
---
As for why pay $80 for a game, I knew I  liked the gameplay, I liked the people I played with, and can very easily see myself roaming the WV wasteland for +1000hrs with friends, and randos...plus that paint job is pretty dope.
---
Monster Mask?
---
You mean the one you can only get from the dev room?
---
If they just ban Legendaries from PvP servers and everything will be golden. Still rewards character building without the shenanigans. Perks and plans. That's all you really need. 
---
You'd have green crystals coming out of your brain you'd think stuff is a wall too.
---
Not if we can get separate servers.
---
PvP players will need to drop their own nukes and PvE players will be able to farm workshops without toxic trolls ruining their experience.
---
I downvoted not because of your incoherent, non-sensical ramblings, rather your atrocious username that seems to celebrate your affinity for dabbing.
---
it was revealed on my birthday 
---
No turrets.
---
They use a ton of budget, so if you omit them you have the budget to do a more complex build.
---
I found one in the mire dont remember where and found a scorched one at fissure site prime during scorched earth. those are the only times i found them but then again i dont actively hunt them
---
Have fun wasting everyones time
---
Right thanks 
---
I‚Äôve noticed this happen on some pieces and not others myself, was wondering if it‚Äôs one of these things that get applied weirdly only after equipping, like junkie damage bonuses in F4 (and probably F76 too).
---
Companionship.  Not every aspect of survival is physical -- there is an immense mental aspect. Part of mental toughness comes when you feel you are "protecting" or "taking care of" another being. The leaders high. 
---
Were all of the rooms and cabins closed for ‚ÄúRemodeling?‚Äù
---
I never see the same people on PC. And only the same servers at night.
---
Yeah. Could have been legal. I can think of a variety of perk cards that might have saved him. 
---
Still ... maybe legal. Fair? No. 
---
There are some other places in the game where deathclaws are guaranteed to spawn. One of them is a cave that you visit in one of the later quests in the game.
---
Spoiler [location](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sam_Blackwell%27s_bunker) if you want it. I believe there are 2 guaranteed deathclaws in this cave every single time you go there, after it's been long enough to respawn (maybe 30 minutes? Not sure).
---
The purpose of nuking WhiteSprings is to get legendary weapons from killing the legendary ghouls. If you have your camp with turrets it kills the ghouls and no one gets anything from those kills. 
---
If any member of your team accidentally hits the camp while trying to kill the ghouls then the turrets attack the whole team and then both teams are in automatic PvP mode. This turns in a huge PvP battle where people are constantly loosing their loot and getting upset. 
---
It essentially destroys the whole purpose of nuke zone legendary farming. I think all my nukes will most likely be at Fissure Site Prime as only idiots dare to place their camp there and soon realize their mistake.
---
Just west of Monangah Power plant is a couple of cabins you can build in. I prefer the Southern cabin as it is undamaged and doesn't have a bunch of Super Mutants in it.  ;)
---
Y.A.R.R.     Yet Another Reconnect Request
---
(Pirate Intensifies)
---
They shouldn't T-Pose, that was fixed in BETA, second patch IIRC.
---
You may want to verify your game cache or reinstall if on console.
---
I was thinking of grabbing the VATS Awareness perk just to see if it could give a loose indication. I've got a few 2-3\* Furious in my stash and I want to know if they're worth bothering over. 
---
? The one from watoga high school
---
They changed this.  Per the January 10th, 2019 patch notes fusion core generators now produce 8 cores an hour.  https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/7hpeHkKxyM6aMWUCCIkeW6/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-10-2019
---
turrets r a joke lol.
---
i see no use of them honestly. 
---
if they add explosive rounds to them like the ones in harper's ferry and make as aggressive as that one. it would be better. Now, i usually have a scorch snipe them from range.
---
imagine how easy it is on a griefer lol
---
Yes.  Unless you are going to put 9 pts into something like riflemen, it is better to put 1 into each card, instead of maxing any of the individual cards.
---
You cannot get that outside of the event, it is removed after the event is over. If they catch you with it, you have a high chance of a ban.
---
I'm out of characters (won't let me add more to the post) but I'll try to condense and include it in the next one!
---
Added, but out of characters to add the PA issue :(
---
So here goes:
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, GT: Godshau
---
I don‚Äôt think a screenshot or video will help, in this case.
---
I have contacted support on this issue yet.
---
When logging into characters, they are often, but not every time on every character, simply frozen in place and unable to open the pipboy. I can occasionally draw a weapon, and I can always pull up the map along with my social menu and game menu. If I wait long enough, I can fast travel, and when it goes into the ‚Äòcircling camera mode‚Äô I can use any button or stick to wake it, so it‚Äôs not an input thing. I would really like to know what the deal is. 
---
Great one, Added!
---
The full name is Fred Savage Divide, where it is actually pretty tame and approachable. And there are moles.
---
Pfft, I don't see any dead ghouls in your pictures. I guess they turned off the respawns over winter
---
That's amazing though, almost creepy how similar it looks. I remember when MATN did his first impressions in the beta, he was shocked at how closely the whitesprings resembled the reality. It's apparently so close to scale that you can trace your own steps. 
---
Cute dog btw
---
what a pain, what platform are you on?
---
Were they inside of the bunker or the stripmall?
---
Either that or it's been glitched out of the high school, from what I hear. I wouldn't potentially waste your caps on it unless it's been confirmed to be obtainable legitimately. Could disappear from your inventory if Bethesda targets them.
---
Care to share your "low population" source with us? Because numbers have not been released.
---
I have never been to Las Vegas and I'm terrified of tall roller coasters.  I am a baby coaster rider lol
---
Wooden roller coasters are the best and the worst at the same time haha
---
I wish a game was set at my town, but Clarksville will never make it into a fallout game. Maybe Nashville? Or Hopkinsville?
---
Heh. A guy I know wanted me to kill him a couple of days ago. He was wanted for inadvertently damaging someone's camp. 
---
I thought that it might be legal to kill someone who's wanted, even if you have pacifist settings.  I can't remember if I unloaded on him with a two shot handmade or a heavy machine gun. Either way, it did no damage at all. ... we had to get another nearby person to perform the execution. 
---
Oldie but goody I forgot to include, will add it as soon as I get more characters (hit cap for post)
---
I wholeheartedly agree. Still, the items they've been putting in the shop are unarguably trash.
---
That's awesome.
---
That‚Äôs unique to All Rise only
---
If you replace the mod too, you can never put it back on
---
Only the standard sledgehammer has a heavy mod
---
I‚Äôd hate it because then what‚Äôs the point of doing anything if you can just craft a god tier gun?
---
Mods like this in FO4 sort of killed the game for me because I had the best gear possible straight out of the vault almost.
---
I mean, they COULD add rare perks only possible to acquire through major events (like SBQ and similiar fights they should add) but we already have mutations that do that so...it‚Äôs back to legendary items.
---
If anything, legendaries should be rarer but better in effect.
---
&gt;Any faction or item which makes sense to be in game should be able to be found by playing the game.
---
I'm surprised it isn't.
---
I feel like that's true, but they don't have to be mutually exclusive. We can get a X-01 skin to resemble the F2/NV advanced power armor, or the desert ranger outfit from FNV. I know plenty of people have said they will pay out the ass for that one. But I do agree that something that fits within the game should be found within the game
---
I've seen people say it's been flagged so i wouldn't go near the mask if you want to keep your acct safe. 
---
Love this spot, it killed me to move, take care of it, and the 2 ghouls that spawn below! 
---
PvP players probably aren't launching many nukes so other than not being shot in the back all of the time PvE players wouldn't even notice the PvP players were gone if they got their own servers.
---
XBoneX but I would imagine it doesn't matter.  It used to happen a lot (1 of 3 workshops for me?) before the patch but now it's at least better.  Just isn't fully fixed.
---
you can already craft fusion cores at the tinker bench under energy ammos
---
I am level 102 and have not yet learned how to craft wood armor.
---
i roleplay as a raider. i kill people, steal their shit, and hope they seek revenge.
---
i dont mess with players under a 100. 
---
I'll take a look at that site, thanks.
---
really?  then what was the PC one last week about?
---
The information, writing style, or both?
---
I agree, sometimes you have to have multiple levels of the same card.  One of my chars has gunsmith L 5 and makeshift warrior L1 for normal use, but I also have makeshift warrior L 5 for Golf Resort farming.
---
Yes I am on PS4! Would it happen to be level 50?
---
You aren‚Äôt wrong, but you reek of hysterical teenager. I blame pre-order culture. If people stopped buying games before they are done, developers will be more likely to finish them.
---
I'm not crying. You're crying. 
---
I think they said that there will be in game stuff to earn as well so that all cool cosmetic things wouldn‚Äôt find from just the Atomic Shop.
---
the mothman took a photo with me nearby 
---
&gt;I'd strongly consider spending $5-10 on more atoms if I happen to be low when a paint job I like comes out. 
---
Too bad the power armor skins are $18.
---
You get a special mod for wood armor at some point in the main quest line.
---
I agree with this as well, but I think we all know that probably won‚Äôt be the case, unfortunately.
---
Ok sounds good all thank you, Maybe ill just buy the white powder jumpsuit
---
I finally got to launch my nuke (for the quest line) and I concur. We got slaughtered. I‚Äôm only lvl 50 so I think I should‚Äôve been more aware. Oops
---
Ok good to know THx
---
New clan, Grahm Groupies, wearing only Barbarian Rags (or whatever those rags are in the atom shop) and carrying puncturing/spiked/bladed boards. 
---
Together we CAN sell the wasteland.
---
I followed the other account too, this one was a just in case you posted with the wrong one...like me.
---
I don't know, a trillion exhibits might make for a good case.
---
I do catch a few players I've seen on the map in other servers on different days, but haven't really noticed a difference in population. I'm a curious person, so I do always check the names on the map when I see a white dot. PC also.
---
Hmm? Try email, zalinto@gmail.com
---
I struggled immensely until I unlocked the White Knight perk so that I could actually wear my armor without it breaking all the time.
---
Yes, I have everything but herbivore from radiation. You can only get one mutation per session, but this can be circumvented by restarting the game after every mutation. I like the mine with the Uranium fever event for this. High radiation sources, radiation arches just inside the mine entrance for a free rad reset and logging out inside the mine will drop you next to the Whitespring station on next login.
---
They want my money? I've spent 300 hours on the game, and I would gladly buy the atoms for $$$.
---
But not for that crap - pyjamas? Toy boxes? Fukken ikea furniture? 
---
They have TONS of amazing assets directly from Fo4, and instead of throwing them in, they wait until most dedicated players will get bored and stop playing.
---
Give me the goddamn concrete walls...
---
In retrospect to this, I‚Äôd prefer a clean version and a dirty version too, like the clown suit an other items.
---
Someone above mentioned you can't - it's included in the 'nuke-safe' area in the Forest.
---
Ok now I understand the issue with your communication skills, idk why I didn't guess that earlier. Go get some bobbleheads and try it yourself, although it seems you aren't interested in discovering the truth just being right in your own mind. God speed.
---
Thanks
---
Well deserved upvote! Also, picture above is solid album cover material. Expecting some sick beats...
---
thanks
---
Don't you know how many years of development work would go into listing the plans you know?! The fact this wasn't in on day 1 is just hilarious
---
Did they kill the queen? If they did, I'd say you're fine and shouldn't feel bad at all, especially since you helped with the other mobs.
---
I see people complain about this a lot but I've been to about 10 prime nukes in the last two weeks and the queen is always killed within five minutes. It's to the point where you have to drop everything immediately and get to prime if you want in on it because otherwise she'll be dead before you get there.
---
Did you get sick drinking Sulpher water from the fountain? Or farm ghouls in the golf club?
---
9 gens at 10 power wouldn't even cost you mats most likely.
---
Was down where the Queen is. I don't think there are any instanced buildings in that area.
---
...TIME TO GO GET A KITTY.
---
In the Nvidia control panel, force the game to use your graphics card and set it to maximum performance. This helped me a ton, if it doesn‚Äôt help you, good luck.
---
No, it's not that, because the bugged pieces don't show any added Rad Resist when inspecting them either.  
---
Example:

---
Well I don't know if there was anything exploitative going on, but I would definitely like to know what was saving his ass.  I mean, it wasn't an autostim thing nor a revival thing.  If I think to pull the clip off my xbox I'll link it when I'm home...even if its a little embarrassing for my poor gimped char.
---
&gt;More than during beta.
---
What are you talking about? I thought this game is in beta. Oh, it's just that buggy? Nevermind then.
---
How do you know you are rejoining the same server?
---
There wasn‚Äôt a PC update last week, but there was a workshop hotfix that was done on the server side. 
---
Welcome
---
I found mine in one of the tiny red toolboxes randomly in middle of a quest. Wasn‚Äôt even a reward just luck. 
---
Do they work like plasma cores and you can get 130% charged ones with the perk? Plus super duper, it might be worth if you do some very extensive flora runs.
---
ALL HAIL THE BEAGLE BAGELS.
---
ah gotcha, was thinking WS. there's a BOS bunker and a mine by the PF. To answer your question directly, I don't think there is any way to survive a blast.
---
You either quit as a hero or play long enough to become a raider. 
---
I feel ya, though. I joined a casual guild and it makes it much more enjoyable. Been hunting outfits and sometimes stirring up trouble among other players of equal levels (I only chase after low levels with a chainsaw and tattered mole outfit, but don't kill/grief em). Looking forward to word of more content.
---
I don't think standing on buildings had any effect on her landing. People have done the same thing in every nuke I've been to recently and she's landed at least once every time (or she got killed before she could even land).
---
If you're in an interior cell who's entrance is inside the blast zone, like the Whitespring hotel or bunker, you'll show on the map as being in the blast zone, but won't be effected by the blast.
---
I don't think lamps and such take the same amount of energy as power armor.
---
I tried this, but terminal is stuck initializing like it doesn‚Äôt detect the keypad switch... how exactly did you do it?
---
An even better idea would be (I think they're called, could be wrong) hashcodes. Instead of saving a face, it gives you a code you can copy and paste. This allows you to save all you want, or share it with friends. An even better option is saving and hashcodes.
---
Grahm saved my ass the other night. Somewhere in the Ashe heap, two scotch beasts pop out and begin doing their thing to some mole miners. Before they see me I hustle over to one of the concrete bunker/pill box looking things that are all over that area, but the door is locked. I'm nearly shitting a brick of excitement because it's one of those moments, unscripted, fun, and what makes a game like this amazing. I finally get in and hide in the corner hoping to ride it out. The scorched beasts head over, and there's a ton of excitement right outside. Then in the subtitles Grahm shows up and he is putting in work on the miners as well, then the scorched beasts went somewhere near to continue pestering away.
---
ah ok, maybe a mistake just assumed it was. Maybe because it is hard to get and they want to profit and do as little work as possible .. but you right if it is the same one, that's lame.
---
Does not answer my question.  How is that proof of duping?  Is duping the ONLY thing that causes that to happen?  I‚Äôm being specific about this because too many people blame duping for every server issue.  That can result in overlooking other causes.  Duping sucks but it‚Äôs not to blame for everything.  
---
THIS is why I love sneak and escape artist.
---
Damn right they did. I immediately resolved to preorder the game on Take me home (country roads) being the theme song alone.
---
I honestly agree but I also understand why it‚Äôs broken. It‚Äôs basically far better than everything else in game as it does +100% damage to everything instead of say +30% toward just ghouls. That said it can be strong if specced into it but not quite one shot territory. Two shot is basically being punished for being the accomplice of explosive effect. I‚Äôm gonna have to respec my character again after the nerf
---
They weren't in any instanced zone, as far as I could tell (blast was where the Queen hangs out).
---
I don't know if I need it so customizable in the game, but a take all button that didn't pop up pipboy screen each time would be great. Doing it this way seems to make my interface stutter and could only cause problems in my opinion. 
---
ProTip: you need to u/ in the comments for the user to actually see a message. Tip 2: remove the ceiling, place, then put the ceiling back on.  This happens with a lot of the items.
---
If you're willing to server hop Fusion Cores are already plentiful as hell often at near full capacity, all you need is to find a guaranteed Sentry spawn and you're swimming in cores as well as the miscellaneous robot resources.
---
Was the Youtube video about different types of muffins?  "cranburrrrry....blueburrrrrry...broken glass muffins"
---
If so, I say it as "cranburrrry" all the time myself
---
There isn't a limit, but from what people have reported at around x10 of you carry weight you can only walk.
---
So I had this issue with my sneak sniper. 
---
I did end up finding a legendary zealot lever gun. I threw a scorched killer receiver on it (50% more damage to scorched 20% less to everything else). 
---
I resorted to a full set of unyielding gear and the couple of leather pieces were moded with shadow for additional sneak bonus in shadows. This pumps agility and sneak. 
---
From there my perks sustained my damage but essentially I just sit in a shadow of a tree or what not and head shot it. The lever gun with rifleman perks says it does 110 damage. I'm assuming that's accurate so add 50% and 30% damage bonuses on there. Looking at about 200 damage per shot. Multiplier for sneak attack about 2.50-3.50 depending on time of day. 
---
I haven't had issues with VATS once I got the critical meter filled up. The distance affects accuracy and sometimes it flies a little further away. When this happens I just have to wait until it flies back around in VATS range unless it's near dead and I go to pursue. 
---
But I noticed a significant damage increase with scorched killer receiver. I haven't found a prime receiver lever gun yet so it's what I gotta deal with. 
---
But if I'm outside of sneak and hit a scorchedbeast I do shit for damage. Makes me miss my melee toon that can two hit a level 65 scorched on the ground. 
---
TSE makes it significantly easier since the damage is so massive, but I expect that to be terrible as well pushing into the upcoming Nerf. 
---
I also have a heavy guns perk for that melee character and I have a furious prime Gatling gun. 200^ damage per shot for that and it brings down scorchedbeast fairly quickly. Although it's absolute trash vs SBQ. 
---
If you can find you a favored weapon you have perk in with zealot (+30% damage to scorched) id recommend you hit the Charleston fire dpt responder vendor and get you a scorched killer receiver and just hold that weapons specific for scorched. 
---

 Ive been getting a crap load of Ce-34878-0 after this last patch. I'm not sure if its connected, however after turning down my DOV slider to about half or less, I was experiencing them less. While it's not a fix, hopefully others will have the same result and not crash as often. 
---
No PS4 Pro here FYI.
---
Good Luck and hopefully this works for someone else. 
---
Did you take the time to go to The Cranberry Glades (Cranberry Bog)? It is such a great place. My family used to go camping there every spring.  I'm still in the air about the Uncanny Caverns. I think they are most likely Organ Cave and that is a good place to go. 
---
The strong reason I bought this game was the locations. I was born in Greenbrier county and grew up in the area. Also if you flew into the Greenbrier Airport you most likely met my mom.  I will say game version Lewisburg was a let down.  Seems too small.
---
That was such an awesome quest, too.
---
It's much easier to just look at a map if you want to know his route, and then you realize finding grahm is almost like finding a 4 leaf clover.

I wanna say it was a Game Grumps video bc it sounds like Dan doing an old man voice, but honestly, it was random background noise and maybe you're right. Do you have a link?

I hope everybody knows that the triggers can skip a quarter of the way down the slider. It makes this much more manageable.
---
"Oh let me drop 1700 .45 for you." *Trigger, trigger, trigger, scroll.*
---
Yeah, but you just described what 100% of cheaters have. The average player doesn't have all that. You might run into someone legitimately like that occasionally, but not every time you log in, the way it feels now. It would be nice to see what actually killed you in a log the way they do it in WoW.
---
zzzzzz
---
Thanks =) I really hope something along these lines are considered for future implementation.
---
no thanks. what a shit idea.
---
Sorry, I scrapped it all for the adhesive. 
---
It‚Äôs lacking hundreds of robots in the front lawn
---
Yeah this was an annoying change. 
---
get over it and talk to people. 
---
They would have to change how radio works, cause right now it is synced for everyone, which would mean silence if you don't have the song.
---
Lol projecting much? You've been rejectionist and closed minded since the first word. You won't even accept the fact that if you can't do it then someone else might be able to. I've got testimonies from several other people of stacking heavy weapons and small guns perks as well as having seen it myself.
---
I just know that if I hold it in my sights my furious .50 cal can kill a scorchbeast in about 10 seconds
---
I wish I could find more bohemoths D:
---
Probably because your CPU doesn't even meet the minimum requirement.
---
I was in the glasses mine when a nuke was launched. I decided to stick around and see if I died. It had no effect, so that's an option. The queen appeared and nobody would help me so I gave up and left. It seemed like a bunch of high level scorched started spawning repeatedly in the cave after detonation though.
---
Those weren't spoiled yet...
---
Well, you'd have to use a controller for that in the first place. There's probably a key board equivalent tho.
---
My first time seeing Grahm, I was in the mountains by the temple, and I saw his chally moo moo, but no Grahm to be seen, so all I heard was a talking Brahmin. 
---
I want wood armour for my stealth sniper build but never get 3 Star so I don‚Äôt bother as I already have leather armour that is better.
---
I don‚Äôt care much about protection.
---
I‚Äôm hoping they add C.A.M.P. DLCs or something like the Vault-Tec and Machinist ones from FO4. Actually have clean and nice things to fill your camp with instead of beat and broken vanilla models. 
---
The guns themself can not one shot players. I mean they can when the player attacks back but pvp in this game is based on who lands the first hit after the damage mitigation is removed. People using other exploits such as the Bobble head exploit are the ones who are 1 shotting people through a 99% damage mitigation. The solution is simple enough jist make it to where people can not hold more than 1 type of bobble head at any given time and make it to where no more than 1 may be used for it's duration of 1 hour.
---
They could have been in the cavern at Fissure Site Prime, the one you have to crawl through in Belly of the Beast. They'd be protected but show on the map at the quarry. 
---
Dude I don't have testimony I've tested it myself you haven't. Here's the deal, all bobbleheads can stack twice if you eat a shit load, possibly three times if there is server lag. Explosive stacks every single time you eat a bobblehead. You don't have any experience on the subject. Testimony from someone on an online game lol. Try it yourself buddeh
---
please dont compare this games story to new vegas and fallout 3, its insulting.
---
I'm curious to see how to evaluate this theory moving forward. I have noticed various scorchedbeast having variable attack speeds. I have looted several prime receiver plans from them but I haven't accounted it to a speed of attacks. I'd have to begin documenting my encounters and observed attack speeds. I usually chalked the spam to server lag or the various bugs, but this is the first concept of alternate speeds due to weapon assignment with prime loots. 
---
I have pacifist mode on so I shoot people all the time to get their attention or just to annoy them
---
I need to go now, thanks a lot 
---
Name 1 NPC in the game you can watch interact with you or the map. Here is a video of Todd saying there are no NPCs!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plyueybHWm8
---
Where are your ally companions? Where are all the other NPCs?
---
Way to concede the obvious lag. It doesn't matter how much Bethesda patches their game. They need to release the completed, functional game.
---
Glitches do exist in every game. Not on the quantity this game has released. Glitches were known on release day and they weren't patched before the release. The update deleted the game from people's computers. The base game file is smaller than the day 1 update. 100 gigs, WTF.
---
The game-play is not at all like the previous in the series. Where are your ally NPCs? Why doesn't vats work the same way as the previous games?  Why don't I have multiple story endings and factions to work with? Why don't I get to play on the same map every time, so I can finish exploring said area before new settlements appear. Fallout 4 began the 4 options for chatting with NPCs, that was the beginning decline that I referenced in Fallout 4. Clearly 76 is not even close to the previous games in anything game play based. Fallout 75 is the epitome of Fallout 4's failures.
---
Fallout 76 has just 29% of the active players that Fallout 4 had in the same time frame.
---
It can barely handle a few enemies on screen before dropping to less than 20fps

You keep telling me that I can't say anything unless I have played the game myself. Just because you have never had a drug addiction before doesn't mean you can't help people with drug addictions. Drop your petty "You haven't played it so you don't know" line. Bethesda is the sales man here, they suck at selling their terrible product. I literally know what I am talking about. Fallout 76 is SO terrible of a game, it dropped in price to 40$ in the very first week of release. How can it be a 40$ game when every fallout game was released at 60$ for over a year? Literally its a terrible game.
---
I can't convince you, because you enjoy low quality products. Its just a feature of you. If you paid top dollar for your low quality product, I am sorry. Bethesda admitted this is the first time they ever did something like this with the online capability, and they straight ruined it. I can't convince Bethesda to change their ways or join reality, you just get to sink with it. You are a fan boi, and you will not listen to anything anyone says. Fan boi's paid the 200$ for the collectors edition garbage pack.
---
The entire thing was a gouge for your money. How much did you give Bethesda?
---
Probably for people like me who have the kill a wengengo in a clown suit and have no idea where to get a clown suit. Now I know that I don‚Äôt have to spend atoms for one. I just need to wait until I discover Freddy‚Äôs house

I'm unsure when Fallout became Fortnite, but u don't like it. 
---
 Amazing! I'm heading to work but will probably be home around 10-10:30 central tim
---
That‚Äôs what you took away from this post? Lol your reading comprehension skills are sorely underdeveloped. Practice more. 
---
For ranged you need at least a decent two shot weapon and a good per build to not struggle too much. For melee you do not need as much if they land. 
---
I did not have any good rifles when i hit 50 for my vats/crit build so it was a problem with the SB‚Äôs for me since i basically had a crafted hunting rifle and a combat rifle.... it was doable but took a looooong time.
---
Later i rerolled to heavy guns and PA before having any good weapons for my rifle build. Found a 2 shot 50 cal machine gun and after that the SB are a joke. If i had a the perks and that build at lvl 50 it would also been easy. But that is the fun part of the game, progress. If i had anTSE too early it would not have been too fun since the journey has been fun, the struggle has been fun.
---
Now i am lvl 250 and have all i need. Not like the dupers but enough to man handle the queen.
---
You will get there too. If you want. Easiest is finding people to play with that has other builds, so you can gift each other the good loot you find for each other, the more friends, the more loot, for all.
---
But finding your own loot is the most fun.

I fast travelled to an area where 3 scorched beasts were attacking...managed to kill one before finding a place to hide..
---
Wow really. That place might be worth farming after a blast.
---
Lol yeah I did similar with the discord but now I just use it to get notified for SBQ nukes.  It's possible prices just got inflated there so I'll have to check out the Reddit then
---
You don‚Äôt, you find/craft/make/buy new ones. There has never been a method to recharge fusion cores that wasn‚Äôt an unintended bug. You can go to the power plants and activate the workshop to try and get some. Get lucky in the wild and find some, or kill sentinel bots and steal theirs. Brain bots also have a small chance of dropping them.
---
I imagine the master race has a mood for that already... But I would imagine they can just scroll the cursor exactly where they want.
---
I'm on PS4 and interested. I have the caps and other legendary weapons for trade. DM me and we can negotiate if you are looking to sell. 
---
Hmm, well that‚Äôs a bug then because the arm text says it should with just them.
---
Scientifically, this should be a natural ability. Your sympathetic nervous system (responsible for fight or flight response, and a large amount of other things that prepare you to fight) reduces your need or urge to eat or drink when in danger.
---
I agree 100%, been looking for solutions for now until proper clean looking stuff comes out.  I was happy with the new flooring that was a big improvement on my camp lol.
---
*throws chicken nuggets...in mouth* :)
---
I'd love just to get some variants for the Military Cap! I had a FOXHOUND one in FO4 I was quite fond of - I figure that won't be possible to get again until mods happen (if at all, since I'm on console this time around), but even so, they certainly could do something like, say, a red one. Sure, it wouldn't have the NCR 1st Recon badge, since they don't even exist yet, but it'd be close... :)
---
I've been having fun with the rent a cops I have been encountering in the forest. Generally it's someone dressed as a cop who comes up to me with pistol drawn. Im usually in a group so they end up emoting at me. I feign fear  holster my weapon, back away and crouch. I back until I get into a corner.  If they have followed me I then swap to my armor piercing miner gauntlet and equip my Fasnacht mask. I  then stand and brandish my weapon.  I then start moving slowly towards them.  
---
This usually gets them to back up. Once I have some room I start swinging wildly and move a bit faster towards them.  Amusingly this often gets some panic and they fire at me. If not I generally stalk them like a movie monster. This has only failed to get them to try and shoot me once.  Once they shoot me it's generally over and I can lunge forward and the claw does quick work. 
---
This is when the fun begins.  I toss some stuff in the bag then while staying crouched move to distance and cover and set up with my sniper rifle.  I then wait for them to come back for their stuff.  When they get it I shoot at them, just missing but the noise almost always gets them to face my direction and then I shoot them right between the eyes and then stand emote wave remove the fasnacht mask and walk away. 
---
Great post, answers a lot of the questions that I have seen posted.
---
Grab a buddy and spit some damage at them in PvP. Kind of the only way to know actual numbers since enemy health bars don't have % values or numerical values. 
---
Fire 5-10 times and then fire a miss and see what damage elevation occurred if any. Etc. 
---
Happens all the time to me when I initially spawn 
---
That's a ban error code. Check email
---
No. Nuke damage hits for 100% player and or npc HP regardless of armor, perks or defense.
---
Every time I finish a camp....  I find a better spot while exploring and get the urge to move and rebuild again.

Yeah... I prepared for that change when it was announced, lol
---
Grabbed weight reducing armor. I‚Äôm actually only encumbered now when I‚Äôm inside my PA D:
---
But you can make all the wood limbs weigh less than a pound, if you get weightless legendary on a wood limb, you can make them weigh 0
---
No, that's a dumb idea.
---
Awesome!

I have a few 3 Star pieces but no two shot or explosives.

They're a very different strain of FEV, much less stupid and violent than the DC and Huntersville versions of FEV, and it takes a very long time for that strain to make it as far as Chicago depending on how far they take tactics as Canon. Not saying I wouldn't like something like jacobstown but it would have to be yet another source of FEV to pull off
---
VATS works fine but they need to be fairly close depending on gun range.

It only seems to happen when the item is at a high enough number that holding the left button hits max speed. If you burst fire the right button, it makes it easier to prevent. Not a fix, just a tip to help until it's patched.
---
You have to wait until everything loads before touching the controls. If you try to move before it‚Äôs fully loaded you‚Äôll get stuck. It‚Äôs a new post-patch glitch.

I don't know if they got her or not. My game crashed when she was about half way down. I'd be willing to wager they probably did though.
---
And in my own defense, I don't feel as bad as I would have if I were the level 23 in a hazmat suit running around out there. At least I had on my T60 and had zero revives needed. 
---
It‚Äôs about your friend forgetting we aren‚Äôt teamed up and hitting you with a bat like he normally does while we are teamed up.  Then you hit him back enter pvp, kill him, and your finishing blow is you using your cannibalism on him.
---
Note he hits you with a bat while teamed up because your cannibalism freaks him out.
---
 Nothing stated yet other then some ‚Äúbalancing issues‚Äù 
---
Yes. This is a new bug.
---
Yeah there are some scary rp I've seen through. lol saw a guy who is a clown rp and he killed me and then ate my corpse. Then one guy came up to me wearing a straight jacket said his name was Jerry. Began talking to his "friend" Charlie who wasn't really there. He then ran off and came back in a dress calling himself Teresa and saying he was Jerry's sister and wanted to find Jerry. 
---
This sounds more like you made a mistake, and the lvl 4 was an opportunistic ass. It's unfortunate, but not Bethesda's fault; all the game mechanics worked as intended, this was human error. 
---
come on, we barely have servers and graphics...
---
you still played it for 300 hours and complain there isn't enough content. lol. people.
---
Thank you so much!

I am at level 144 and about 340 hours into Fallout 76. I have felt like you at a few stages of the game, but I keep finding more ways to occupy myself. First it was the simple things, respec'ing and finding my build-focused legendary gear. I began on daily selling runs to all the faction vendors, as I was regularly running exceedingly over encumbered, I was walking everywhere. It allowed me to explore more and see those things you would otherwise miss. Then it was storing and rebuilding my C.A.M.P. from scratch - it gained me some build space, allowed me to re-work and clean up the power wiring and I was able to build a few more items and fix a few design issues. Now I have a polished workspace / home that is a joy to return to. I spent some time taking and defending the various workshops just to gain plans I was missing. I then went on a mutation spree, instead of being selective, I opt'ed for the more random (fun) approach of jumping into a pool of radioactive material and letting the dice roll. I ended up gaining all but 2 of the mutations, Grounded (still want this one) and Herbivore. I then set out to once and for all fix my over encumbrance. I wanted to streamline my build so I could effectively function in or out of power armor and not prohibit myself from fast traveling. It was also a focus of mine with the last patch to use fewer fusion cores as they were no longer being topped off when I returned. I ended up 'refilling' and storing 30x 100% cores prior to the patch and refuse to pull them from the stash now and run a much-reduced reliance on Power Armor. I now run carrying about 175 lbs. regularly, and that is with 3 suits of Power Armor on me - My primary, a backup that I don't want to store in the stash and one I am building for a friend (I have 6 other suits in my stash), plus I carry 7 legendary weapons (a variety of rifles mostly) and a few core aid materials. I have eliminated the use of food items that spoil, choosing to go exclusively with Canned Dog Food and Nuka-Cola. I have my times I enjoy being the lone wanderer, exploring or doing a vendor run, but I have focused a lot of time recently to helping other players. I have provided materials, and my C.A.M.P. for crafting. I have guided them on missions or provided my recommendations on gear or helping them to attain the Excavator or X-01 plans. I've helped with their first Nuke Silo runs or by providing them my wealth of duplicate plans. What I'm trying to say... while we may be low on scripted content and events get repetitive, the grind isn't the goal, the wasteland is what we make of it, you can't get to the next adventure if you don't go looking for it. Don't be discouraged, the wasteland is still rich in content, it's strength is the players, this is where our next stories of triumph will come from.
---
I have joined plenty of fo76 buddy‚Äôs.
---
Sometimes ( for the most part ) servers are always full on Xbox 
---
And never once worried about not bumping in to other players , probably just to buy all their mr fuzzy tokens lol 
---
Deathclaw and ants at thunder mountain substation just north of Watoga.
---
Phoenix (BoS Watoga Vendor) can survive a nuclear blast, so I would imagine if you could kill Phoenix and take his body and make robot armor out of it, you could survive a nuclear blast too. He's really tough. Even helps out in SB Queen fights from time to time. If the BoS had more bots like Phoenix, they may have still been around now.
---
Please let me scrap shitty legendaries to get legendary crafting components to make better legendaries. This would give a usefulness to the 99% of legendaries that are shit.
---
A million times yes and please. Friendly mutants, ghouls, sentient robots, deathclaws, monsters, vault projects, aliens, there's countless things you can add with fallout lore as it is even if you're still so dead set against adding in human npcs.  
---
nah sometimes they do t-pose occasionally. but since last patch the scorched enemies have been way less glitchy. no messed weapons or anything

If someone with a better voice wanted to do it that'd be grand
---
The same reason  alot of games have loot boxes. There are idiots who will buy em.
---
My guy, dear stupid mother fucker. It's happened, I've seen it. Enjoy denying that fact. Move on with your life instead of calling people babies and handicapped. I'm starting to think you've actually got some handicaps yourself.
---
Probably not :/
---
Yes and no, I considered the F76 balance as pretty irrelevant at this stage, then I have advanced into godhood and I do believe that this game, when it comes to actual math balance, is made very solid. There is another problem, mainly that there is only a single way to godhood and its not looting stuff. Its waiting until you drop your first ubergod item so that you can market it for other god items so that after few deals you get into full set. It shouldn't be like this, and it should be possible - albeit tedious - to craft legendary mods.
---
But for now it is not and the worst thing you can do in PvP is not to trade items with other players. If you dont trade you are just unready to participate in PvP, period, and its a shitty situation.
---
From a perspective of a person running in full cavalier set, I must say that if you are not bloodbuild, you cannot brute force me without VATS at all. I can just run around and facecatch all of your TSE shotties etc. Bloodbuild, on the other hand, decimates me even in my set. On the other hand, the selection of weapons that provide enough kick to VATS 1hit a bloodbuild is much broader then selection of weapons that could harm me that way.
---
A properly balanced game is a game where there is no single OP build that always win. There is no such build in F76, hence I believe that the balance problem of this game is not with item power, but with item availability.
---
 Many people complain that current PvP is who oneshots who first. I consider this complain invalid, and a sign of being a noob. If the game would be 1hit vs 1hit, then it would be all about positioning and map control, and calling such unPvPable indicates that such person is meat, not competitors, because they move like a noob, they watch the map like a noob, they bring a spoon to a gunfight because knifes are too complicated, are generally speaking intelectually lacking and they do not learn at all. But its not 1shot vs 1shot if you are properly prepared, and the math of god vs god fights is really interesting.
---
 Again, the problem is that after three months of dedicated gaming, being a god should be something reliable, not just luck. Now, its luck, until I dropped my first god legendary at level 190, I had nothing I could trade for other god items, and if I did not drop it, I'd probably still be a ungeared buckethead (noob PA user).
---
Practice what.  I know when to run and when to fight. Crying on the internet is not the way to beat a sb. 
---
That last one is great, points for effort
---
This game is running on a fifteen year old engine; you don't need dupers to cause disconnects. 
---
There is another one that says that you can use bobbleheads to gain abilities or refresh their timer
---
kind of does. When I want to watch fallout content. I don't want to see all these uninformed videos ranting about the same 3 things for 10-20 minutes so they can get as many ad's as possible into it. oh yeah don't forget to SMASH that subscribe button. HIT THE BELL!!?!??!
---
Love when a legendary alpha deathclaw loads in before I do.
---
[Checks carry weight]  Running? What the hell is that?
---
THERRRRRRRREEEEE WAASSS NEVERRRR A MANNNNNNNNNNNN LLLLLLIKE MYYYYYYYYY JOHNNYYYYYYY
---
Or a fusion ore combiner. 
---
It was odd, they were spread out in the blast zone, and I don't think all were in Crystal Caves. Was thinking that stacking bobbleheads would have allowed them to survive a blast.
---
I have a monster mask. I didnt cheat to get it either. I was doing the monster mash even in the high school when a level 102 came in. For the first round he just sat in the corner invisible. When I went to get the mask for the second round he stabbed me in the back when I picked the mask up it glitched out off of my characters head. I thought he ruined the even cause without the mask equipped I couldnt collect the candy buckets as the mission kept telling me to pick up the mask. I ended up quitting out cause the guy ruined the event for me. Next time I logged in poof there it was in my inventory. Equips just like any other mask or clothing it can be put on and taken off. I dont really wear mine cause where it is bugged out you still get the sound effects of the kids screaming from time to time and that gets annoying. Damn thing wont let me trash it or stash it, it is just stuck in my incentory, I havent been able to trigger the monster mash event since then. So yeah that will be my luck they ban me for what was already a sh:tty day.
---
We can have prewar ghouls though just fine. Humans turn ghoul before turning feral ghoul anyway.
---
Ditch the Targeting HUD.  I did and have been so much more stable on PC.  It's amazing how the game plays when I'm not crashing and figuring I need to visit all the vendors again.  Now I can play through enough to DO things.
---
Also important thing to note is that the serum has a one hour temporary effect of not having the negative effects. After the hour, you will then experience the negative effects. This can be mitigated with rank 3 class freak which reduces negative effects of mutations by 75%
---
So can my Anti-Armor Gatling Plasma. I think it's just an indication of how good heavy guns are against Scorchbeasts, not the quality of the legendary effect. 
---
I was shocked while fighting the SBQ (I was one of the lower level people so was concentrating on the other mobs) because I killed a scorched mongrel and one item I got was a "dog helmet." I'd never seen dog armor or apparel before, and it's existence seems strange if companion animals aren't in the offing. Has anyone else come across dog armor in the wild? It was only that once for me. 
---
Interesting bc I‚Äôve had it stop before target is killed and start up again later in the fight. I think I first encountered this glitch after the mid-December patch. 
---
Always enjoy a good puppers, but 95% sure this is going to get flagged as spam.
---
I know the context of the game, you fail to realize that the general population of the game is basically tumblr kids. 
---
Definitely drop the HUD.  I made a new helmet for my Exc PA without one and I'm pretty stable.  Only downside is the extra helmet weight....

My addition to the lost is all the skins for the different raider armor pieces!! I buy all of em at the vendors and have to see which ones look the best!!!

Why do lights impact your budget so much? I get certain lights should but man do these things suck up the bank. 
---
The spawns are fine. They just need to lower the opacity of the sonic attack so I can *fucking* ***aim!!!***
---
I have said it from the start but we should have pure cooperative PvE servers, PvP servers, and mixed mode. I'd qualify what we are all playing on right now would be a form of mixed. And they said they're workin on that PvP mode you select.... just need pure cooperative PvE mode as an option too.  
---
I don't consider that hat lore friendly at all.. Idk why though it just doesn't feel fallouty enough.. 
---
That pink castle bed is pretty boss though.
---
After further testing I'm no longer selling the shotgun. It heals significantly better than my pistol build so I am also changing my build.

I finally got a baseball bat after no loot at all for 15 times last night!!

I use the 10mm SMG and the .45 SMG and both go with commando perks I found explosive SMG and the demolition perk under int brings it up a lot also, 
---
Maybe. But my dog looks like a mongrel...
---
Wow. Exact opposite with the same result for me. Horrible step dad but wouldn't be who I am without him.
---
Nah it takes about 8 aeconds to vhew through the first half of the health bar then the rest just vanishes. The furious effect stacks absurdly high
---
I also have all the rifle perks and my pipe weapon only does 137. I can get a harden hunting rifle to 150. But the reload animation is slow so I use the lower damage pipe. idk how people have these 300 damage rifles.
---
Great info.. Thanks
---
The truth is in the eye of the beholder.

So what were you banned for?
---
Don't leave us hanging!

aww i probably threw it away :(

That‚Äôs the worst part about this glitch for sure lol
---
this has nothing to do with what they drop. Also the way you wrote your post is something lol.
---
Do you have a Gsync monitor? 
---
ALT TABing fixes the stuttering for me when playing in borderless window. I keep posting this on stuttering posts and everyone ignores me.... But I'm telling ya, it works (win 10).
---
How about a join server to collect a bounty option?
---
High levels grouping up with time on their hands can server hop for a fun continous bounty farm. I thought the whole wanted concept was to make hunting down wanted as content.

Hm. That's...something.
---
But not what I'm thinking of. Thanks anyway though
---
Someone has been reading the what-if scenarios regarding the SotU.
---
Read the first 2 words as *Heather Graham* and wondered what the heck she had to do with anything. 
---
It's a plan that you learn which can be applied to any wood armor I believe. It's not a mod in the mod section of your inventory.
---
Switching from rifles to shotguns has taken me over 3 weeks.  I'm glad they at least added respeccing, but there's a lot of room to make it more forgiving. I wouldn't say it should be easy, but it's currently pretty brutal for a casual player.
---
Look for brackets in the hacking code that light up a section of code when highlighted. These get rid of some of the false codes and can even reset your tries
---
Unsure because I haven't crafted them, but yeah if you hit the 30% chance with super duper you can craft 2 cores for 1 of every flux. Still sounds like a really bad value in my opinion.
---
I kinda want the hat...
---
maybe...
---
Yeah, I should've tried to trade it away instead üòï I got a bunch of legendary stuff defending the Berkeley Springs workshop from anglers, but, to me, it was pretty much all worthless anyway.
---
It seems to happen when the game is loading something. Maybe it started loading a chunk of map while you were moving and that‚Äôs what got you stuck
---
https://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm261680.htm
---
They also take away from the things you get as quest rewards
---
I understand.
---
Would be interesting to test it out how much time would it take, but farming flora is just too boring for me.
---
It is a real shame.  Plasma used to be an amazingly effective weapon in all other fallouts.  But here it's slightly more effective than wafting a fart in your enemies direction.
---
I get it sometimes too, but i am 100% sure everything is loaded by the time I begin moving. I have a decently fast PC, and FO76 installed on a decent SSD, so loading is almost a non-issue for me.
---
I've picked up a few pieces with natural rad resist with the legendary effect and ones without natural resist. It seems to conflict with a piece of armor's natural rad resist, only applying the natural resist instead of stacking. 
---
For the case of the Leather, Metal, and Raider's pieces I've found and put lead lined on, it gave a solid 35 rating, as it should.
---
I hope they fix it so I can be a real radfiend. Though I can survive in a nuke zone without PA, it's a tough time depending on how many radiation chems I have.
---
It is something? That is true!
---
I guess we can't really know since we can't see the actual sales numbers. Going only by what I've seen here that Blackbird armor was incredibly popular and it was just a black palette swap with red accents. Although in my own, in game experience I very, very rarely see people with Atom Store things.
---
I will have to get on and look don‚Äôt remember of top of my head...what Armor?
---
Farmed for 300+ hours it's got less than 24 hours of content I played 300 hours because morons believe you need to put in alot of time to make an opinion.

They are more effective than the alien blaster lol
---
Go to Watoga. There are a least five places that I know of where you can find fusion cores.
---
&gt;Iv'e probably spent like 400.00 in that game over the last 5 years.
---
over 5 years that works out to about $7.00/month so the wife doesnt notice the money being laundered, typically its around xmas i might spend some money and buy cosmetic items in games like fo76 or even warframe cause its the holidays and i want to have fun. 
---
Honestly the only reason this post is getting any exposure is because of amount of real world money.
---
Reading about some one spending 150 real world dollars to me is no different than reading about some 13 year old kid buying this for 25000 caps and maybe some serums.
---
UI glitch like the one that happens in Mama Dolces, as I was dropping he sent the friend request, sounds like this sort of extra interaction bugs out the UK. Had I actually went to weapons I had an exterminators hand made and all rise, plus all my frags and cryo grenades that should've dropped before that. Not that this absolves me, it's a glitch we've known about I've just never had it happen outside of MD's 
---
I do hope so. Asthetically they're my favourite weapon. 
---
Don't think it's solved yet

Ouch, that sucks. I'm on PC and I have over 150 photos saved... and that's after deleting at least another hundred during my quality cuts. &gt;.&lt;

Goddamnit.
---
I have this issue on xbox. the funny thing for me is that it was only happening while I was in Watoga - I would spawn in and run around for 10 minutes or so and then crash to the dashboard. Once I left for my camp it happened in longer increments of time. Maybe a memory leak of some kind?
---
Sentrybots and the Battle Bot event are a great source of 50%-100% charged cores
---
Compare to Fallout 3 -- Power Armor doesn't even have a removable Fusion Core, the core was supposed to last for centuries and the lore was established for that and FONV.  FO4 "broke" that lore and claimed the cores were at their EOL mark during the events of that game; that was set only a few years after FO3 so technically the lore could still hold.
---
FO76 is only 25 years after the Great War, so that becomes lore-breaking.
---
Fusion Cores last only 25 years?  Power Armor would have to be bricked by the time of FO4.
---
Fusion Cores last 200+ years?  FO76 mechanics are full of shit.
---

[unsolved according to this link, Alpha and Charlie are solved though](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/21-01-2019-fallout-76-nukes-guide-how-to-find-nuke-codes-silos-and-nuke-other-players-in-fallout-76#section-1)
---
Give me generic palette swaps for Excavator, red, blue, orange, black, for a dollar a piece. Sold. Free money. (actually I won't spend any real money, just atoms I earned in game... maybe my opinion doesn't matter lol, I'm not the target customer.)
---
Ah, I'm guessing that's for gatling laser with ultracite barrel? I'm guessing that uses a fusion core and some nuke materials? Shit, when you craft those does it just eat a random fusion core or does it at least start with lowest charge?
---
I kinda agree with those two, mainly any item which is in the fallout world but which would break lore being in 76 is fair game for the shop (eg Anything from Caesar's Legion).
---
There is a dupe that crashes the entire server and rolls back anyone on server at the time. That's why you cannot rejoin 
---
Thanks! I hadn't realized I could use the mouse for that menu!
---
The game already has zero story
---
Yeah giving stimpaks to friends for free is a real pain. If I overshoot the 0, it's quicker to cancel and try again. So annoying.
---
lmfaoooo wrong subreddit MY BAD \*facepalm\*
---
Do you use the targeting HUD? There's a bug with it with the new patch. I was crashing a lot with the targeting HUD. Haven't crashed a single time since I removed it
---
There might be something there, in terms of items with inherent rad resist, but I've seen it plenty on pieces without any rad resist (Combat Armor, for example) - so, that might just be variance.
---
The turrets need a buff but even if they were stronger the AI in them still barely functions. Half the time they just sit there without firing. 
---
There is no solution for those of us with 100% stored but nothing in stored.  I can't even build a damned stash box currently.  Had to resort to starting over. :(  Heard there might be a "fix" coming out with next update, but given how useless Bethesda support was, I'm not counting on it.
---
Non-legendary does. Look at what it says at the bottom center of the screen when you craft it. "Increases Radiation Resistance"
---
I don‚Äôt think I have any left and Me and my business partner plan to take the rest of the week of from Farming and server hopping  non stop.
---
The clean versions still kinda feel wrong, shouldn't they really just be the rare spawn version of any in game clothing.
---
I agree with that. It is a nuisance and you can get knocked out of pacifist mode in certain ways that aren't intentional or causes you to want to withdraw from certain features or parts of the game so you don't.  
---
But I still have such a hard time understanding PvP in this game from the lore and set up of the game. No matter how much I think about it it still is hard for me to come to grips of why some of our fellow allies, friends, coworkers, people we've been hanging out with for years in the vaults, suddenly step outside with our mission of rebuilding America and cleaning up the region.... suddenly just turn into raiders and murderers against each other? It's not like we're competing for resources, we got CAMPS, we can fix all the factories and energy plants together, and we all have the same intro origin of reclaiming and rebuilding together. It just doesn't fit right in my brain no matter how much I mull it over.
---
Won't that grass disappear if you replaced those floor sections?
---
I managed to get a bunch of people together on PS4, we Roleplay as the Enclave. It's pretty fun, we hosted an RP event recently which went really well. 
---
Possible error or glitch in-game:
---
I was playing last night, 1/22/2019, and I received an achievement for killing 76 scorched "with a pistol". I was using my crafted sniper rifle that I made by modifying a pipe rifle, and I have almost never used a pistol in 76. Is the game seeing my crafted pipe-sniper rifle as a pistol? Does that mean it's not applying the bonuses from the rifleman and expert rifleman perks?
---
Playing on Xbox One
---
No I‚Äôve seen them at level 5. 
---
Dam breh lately I been only getting the opposite 
---
I 'recharged' and stored 30 cores before the last patch. I leave them in my stash and rely only on found cores now, the stashed ones are my 'in case of emergency' supply.
---
When are pvp servers coming up? This is news to me.  I feel this will temporarily bring back many high level players that stopped playing b/c they reached ‚Äúend game.‚Äù
---
Lol, good point. I've had zero temptation to spend my atoms at all.
---
Yo I'd be down for paying 600 atoms to have a dog on my head
---
Add to the long list of stupid ass bugs. 
---
Actually it allows you to tag everything without killing, so everyone can tag.
---
The classic ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt experience this problem so it must not exist‚Äù post. With some victim blaming thrown in. Good job. 
---
Fingers crossed it gets patched so I can find Weightless Rad Resistant Marine Armor and make it lead lined. One can hope.
---
Hey man can you PM me and send a pic of you wearing this helmet? I‚Äôd love to see it
---
What? Combat Armor? Combat armor has zero rad resistance. You mean the Lead Lined mod?
---
Play with a friend. It gets boring and a bit tough near the end. 
---
That doesn't explain FO3, as I mentioned in another reply.  We're stuck with the unfortunate paradox that Fusion Cores still have the same degradation rate 25 years after the Great War and 210 years after the Great War, but zero (or vanishingly small) degradation 200 years after.  That's not even remotely explainable without breaking lore.
---
I thought the same but I can't find the interview again.
---
When I kill enimies I get high level ones. The rewards I've gotten for missions are always below my level and shit ones like hunters pool cue shit like that. I don't get it lol 
---
i just want the mechanist suit
---
Right! They act like they don't even have a line of sight function. But the in game enemy turrets can smell me hidden through 6ft of concrete and fire updated rounds ü§£
---
Ah, you mean it from this point. Well fusion cores didn't exist in FO3 as a thing at all, so the easiest retcon to not break your head would be that your character swaps them in the background.
---
And since their introduction they did stay consistent - a very good battery, will power your home for centuries or will shoot big lasers for 30min. Kind of like first iron man suit in iron man movie.
---
I was excepting a video of someone server hopping a vendor trying to get a jetpack...
---
You get nothing if your turret kills an enemy so this is the stupidest thing to do. There is no farming. It is just being a dick to other players
---
When I was backpacking around the US I stopped in WV, was pleasantly surprised to see a parody of Hillbilly Hotdogs (if it still exists i'd highly recommend you stop by)
---
I have this issue sometimes if i have the exact number of mats needed.  Couldnt repair my pa torso until I found an extra screw over the needed amount.
---
Love this idea! I would definitely join of of these. Especially if they made sure it was legendary or had a small following that included a legendary. 
---
I'm on ps4 too
---
I hope so! Let's first try to get this noticed.
---
I‚Äôve see trapper rad resistant pieces where the RR clearly has been added (for trapper + material mod + leaded + legendary combined high total).
---
 Nice piece btw ;)
---
I'll take the broken toilet and grimy bathtub if they'd just add a god damned sink
---
Why is the only sink in my house part of my drug lab?
---
Worst day for me today regarding crashes...
---
I've been playing since around 2 hours now and the game crashed the 4th time now -.-
---
One time during Scorch Beast Queen, was a long fight already lasting 20 minutes... Then crash and you can't rejoin the server.
---
All my friends already stopped playing the game. I kept playing because i was lagging behind with quests and leveling but now after i hit lvl 80 i think i might stop playing too now.
---
So annoying with the crashes and bugs, games makes less fun everytime i login :/
---
Nope and these are dips that are wayyyyyyyy too low for Gsync to fix. Also, I shouldn't have stutter period. Not when running in 1440 and medium settings. I prefer to fix an issue rather than slap a patch on it. For all I know, I could be infected with some form of Malware and it is searching through terabytes of storage space. 
---
You can‚Äôt get a refund sorry
---
I just want my scientist build to work and look cool
---
Confirmed duper, have at him! /S
---
I feel like it's a memory leak of some kind because I crash less often outside of Watoga as well
---
Thanks, got it. :)
---
No, when you add the BOS mod to combat armor in crafting, look at the bottom center of the screen. It says "increases radiation resistance" in the same spot where it tells you anything else extra about a mod... like where it tells you a receiver "increase hip fire accuracy"
---
Not sure where these rumours of PVP servers are coming from but they are not releasing separate PVP servers :)
---
im reading around the reddit that caps at 30%
---
Oh definitely the old game stuff is what would sell instantly.
---
Literally dont have the patience for the DMV quest and turned it off after they asked me to stamp the paper with governors seal. Nah fam I quit. 
---
There's talk of them in the new vault article https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019
---
I literally just experienced the same thing. It‚Äôs happened several times before. I spawned into a nuke zone and watched my health drop fast from the rads. Luckily I realized I could fast travel and left the nuke zone. I also noticed that VATS still works but couldn‚Äôt move, aim, or shoot. 
---
I‚Äôm also on xb1 and Gt is Caddy400ex. 
---
It's hard to know what to keep. As a rule, the armor that boosts defense is highly sought after. Can't remember the name. Enduring or something. 
---
Or play with yourself... with the door locked, always lock the door
---
I just want to be able to share pics I take in FO76 with other players
---
There ARE definitely pieces that correctly add up the rad resistance. It's just really random and more often doesn't.  
---
And the piece I got offered, but I passed on it due to this buy, haha. I can still pick it up, but unless they fix it - it's just 2-Star, haha  
---
For perspective 1000 hours in fallout 4 still quest I haven't done the boredom quest for that game is all the quest in 76.
---
Could not of said it better Honey.
---
More fun when you have more hands on deck
---
That's a CAMP of a cheater as you cannot build so many turrets 
---
 and a structure that size within the normal CAMP budget
---
Mad Max's dog was part of the inspiration behind the original Dogmeat so either movie would work. [Though I'd want to compare it to something like A Boy and His Dog since in that movie the dog survives unlike the other two.](/spoiler)
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll place a single wall on a foundation and try to attach it to see if it works. Either way, it would be great if the devs could address is so that all of this isn‚Äôt necessary.
---
Copy that
---
Yeah, not sure what they'll do. That's why I made sure to put potential :) it'll be awesome to see how they do integrate this.
---
So far I ha e spent 200 dlls on this game and I would double that for a quetzal 
---
I have this issue too. Not sure if it is what is impacting the OP, but its definitely from the most recent patch.
---
Likely the same Asshat that insisted that the game be released before xmas in its then state. 
---
At this point its almost a FU from Beth. You hiys want cool shit, well here is a Baby bonnet, adult diaper and rattle skin.
---
^(Oh really? I thought they destroyed the drop rate on them?)
---
Thanks! Didn‚Äôt know that.
---
I halfway expect serious PvPers will migrate to the new servers, and griefers will stay on the mainstream servers to mess with people.
---
Seek hoarding counseling now to save yourself heartache and pain later; when you realize all of your teddy bears are now scrap cloth, and you either have to keep your collection of bobbleheads or your new leg. weapon, but not both.
---
10/10 good doggo
---
Yes and thanks for posting this info, hope Bethesda fixes this crap soon though üò≠
---
Glad to hear you've met some nice people! I've never seen a community be this generous and helpful in an mmorpg before. It's pretty cool. 
---
The only good use for plasma rifles to me are to make them into flame throwers....but then again it uses like 20 cartridges per second. They should edit the ammo consumption of throwers.
---
So there isn't two versions of each recipe requiring water.
---
absolutely doodley
---
I added this into the main bit of the idea. Because your right don't even need them in pve.
---
This is obvious. The fact it's still not like this is infuriating.
---
From what I gather I think I was mistaken. That's the one I have https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/a78y5b/i_think_i_found_my_style/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Your HP is going to be set to whatever your value is + modifiers, this does not include rad resistance.  Your rad resistance will only effect the amount of rads you are receiving per sec. The math is wonky, its more complicated then just being additive.
---
PVP Game mode NOT servers.
---
At best its a BR type mode and at worst its the cod style map that's been leaked on you tube already.
---
Wish they would put separate servers in but as its something the community want, its no doubt going to be ignored by Bethesda :/
---
It really doesn't go with any of the released clothing, either.
---
Good point, I'll do that. Thank you!
---
I crash on my xbox one S more than on my one X, mainly when i deal with legendary weapons and my stash. 
---
Thanks for the hint. There is nothing in my email about any bans. If I'm banned, then they did this since the very beginning without giving me any chance to play.
---
I've sent an email to Bethesda support, asking them to check my ban status.
---
I've heard of this being an extremely rare case, so just to clarify... you can place your CAMP but nothing else and nothing is stored?
---
Really loved your comment among all else here i hope u/LoneVaultWanderer gets to see this one.
---
this isn't fallout 4 don't pick up everything you see
---
scrap your stuff often and then stash it
---
you don't need more than 1 turret at your camp
---
don't fix non-legendary guns. Scrap and use another one
---
take over all workshops at least once
---
Your consistent use of false equivalence isn't going to change my mind. it's pathetic that you have to stoop to it to try and support your point. you saying the game is trash is the same as saying a movie is trash based on watching a trailer and reading some reviews. It is the definition of an uninformed opinion. 
---
I paid $42 dollars for the game on CD Keys, but i would have happily picked up the PA edition had i been able to guarantee a release day arrival. 
---
You can call me a fanboi if you want, if that makes you feel better, but i'm a grown ass man who has been a fan of the fallout universe since FO1, and i enjoy FO76. You wont change my opinion of it, not because i'm a fanboi, but because i ENJOY PLAYING IT.  
---
But at the en of the day, i'm going to go home and play a game i enjoy, and you are going to continue shouting your unwanted opinion to people that don't fucking care. so... you win? enjoy your miserable life, bud. 
---
I had decent results using the Gatling plasma, but the durability was awful. Same with the laser rifles. 
---
boom exactly
---
Light sources from anywhere in the game slow down servers, each item takes up budget depending on how much whatever it is that impacts the game performance
---
I don‚Äôt get double hunger for dogfood.
---
I guess it isn‚Äôt real dog.
---
LOL! You're completely right! I've NEVER noticed that. That must be either:  
---
\- a bug  
---
\- a line left over that was never meant to be and should've been something else  
---
Yessss! Me too!  I love going to the OG Hillbilly Hotdogs in Lesage.  Hands down my favorite place to go in the summer!
---
Just like anything that provides your base with utility
---
Thank you! This was exactly what I was aiming to hunt for tonight.
---
I'm going to add that in the OP. Thanks for the heads-up!
---
Ah right yeah that‚Äôs the tactical not the normal marine helmet, pm me if you have any cool or rare clothing to show me, I‚Äôm a mega collector so I might have stuff you need too 
---
This is very well done. If you can do motion stuff and would be interested in making some stuff for dance music shows, let me know.
---
Dang that really blows. I'll definitely try to do some more research. If you figure anything out please let me know and I'll be more than happy to get an updated post out there, thanks a lot for the info üëç
---
I hope so. I love my plasma gatling. But even with all the perks, it breaks too often.
---
I agree that aside from duping fixes this should be the top priority!
---
You may have just saved me a ton of wasted time, I'll have to try this out. Thank you!
---
I'm not a serious theorycrafter but I believe it's all a percentage of rads taken. Even with X01 power armor and Rad-X, your Rad resist will be somewhere around 700 but you'll still take some rad damage from even ghouls, much less a nuke zone. My theory is that rad resist reduces the percentage of rads you take, and it might be a very low number, say .001 rad per second, but it still eventually adds up to apparent rads.

Charisma 4 is good regardless 
---
You can collect dirty water from rivers, wood from felled trees and boil water at a stove
---
Bloodleaf (along river from overseers camp to flatwoods) and Sootflowers (blue flowers) can be combined with boiled water to make healing balm
---
Cannibal needs lead belly to avoid you getting rads 
---
Razorgrain soup is good way to get food and water at the same time 
---
Sounds like the same spot. Looks like I have to find a spot... I really liked that spot. 
---
600 stash limit add's up quickly fast!
---
Its not like single player fallout's where you can loot and store the world! Get into the habit of being a bit more selective with what you store.
---
Run melee for the first few levels to stock pile some ammo, and if you see a high level run up to you and start emoting then go into there pip boy, wait a few mins see if they drop a bag of goodies for ya :)
---
Yeah! By a lot!
---
Did not know this, thank you. 
---
Deleted my Reddit post for you, but I was talking about the plan not the mod box.
---
Pretty sure it's the same voice as Amethyst from Steven Universe.
---
Oh wow. Ok.
---
Obvious you weren't around at that time so you seem to be lacking understanding of the issue.
---
I'll start with the second part since you lack even the basic ability to search for things on the Internet.
---
Bear in mind all of the examples below were prior to the post I put up about Bethesda's feedback response.
---
&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9suwl5/unlocking\_your\_fps\_gives\_you\_speed\_hacks\_just/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9suwl5/unlocking_your_fps_gives_you_speed_hacks_just/)  
---
&gt;EDIT: Bethesda has answered: [https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-betas-physics-are-tied-to-its-framerate-1830140345?IR=T](https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-betas-physics-are-tied-to-its-framerate-1830140345?IR=T)  
---
&gt;This explains the lack of refresh rate and FOV settings in-game. Looks like adjusting these values too much would start to explode the game engine.  
---
&gt;For an online game this is just appalling.Everyone running around with max speed killing each other with absolutely no cheat program at all.
---
&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uqvpb/is\_there\_fps\_lock\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uqvpb/is_there_fps_lock_now/)  
---
&gt; My frames are locked to 63 ? no matter what settings i use it wont go over 63. Last beta i got 100 fps easily 
---
&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ui6l0/fps\_is\_capped\_at\_63\_hz\_in\_the\_login\_menu\_after/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ui6l0/fps_is_capped_at_63_hz_in_the_login_menu_after/)  
---
&gt;Such a lazy fix if it's capped in-game as well. The issue doesn't even present itself until past 144fps with a 1% speed increase at 120. They could have easily capped it at 120 and satisfied high framerate players, fix the issue, and not cause the input lag from the 60fps lock. 
---

---
Just look at the comments for this one.
---
That's just a fraction of the posts regarding fps PRIOR to the feedback post. Look it up yourself if you don't feel this is comprehensive enough.
---
Also some other things conspicuously left out of the feedback post were text chat and proper key rebinds.
---
I'll leave you to look those up. There are several posts that exist prior to Nov 8th that request that feature too that just was ignored. Still not mentioned to date as far as I'm aware.
---
You're on the losing side of this discussion. If you were there you'd know how difficult and how much pressure was required to get Bethesda to do even the things they said they were going to do in that first feedback post. Much the same with how much pressure was required to get them to actually give the collector's edition people an actual canvas bag rather than just 500 atoms. 
---
They're listening and responding better now admittedly in terms of bug fixes and potential feature updates but dragging them kicking and screaming seems appropriate given how difficult it was to get them to the stage of that feedback post and canvas bag.
---
How it worked in other games including 4:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation_Resistance
---
Which is probably how it works now.
---
There's a notable exception in Hazmat and PA because they provide something else (a flag, a multiplier, etc).
---
500 RR in a rad suit or PA is not 500 RR in normal armor.
---
Thanks for the tip for the power armor station, I had given up on a one story crafting area. 
---
Picking up plans and recipes isn‚Äôt enough to learn them. You need to go into the notes section on your pip boy and activate to learn them. If nothing happens you already know the plan/recipe. Took me far longer to figure this out than I care to admit and thought there was a bug. 
---
It's a hacking game changer
---
quest rewards are lower. I used my lvl 5 sommerset special until i was like level 40. 
---
Uranium Fever mole miner drop level 40 legendaries i believe. 
---
It all depends on your level and the level of the legendary you are fighting. 
---
 it should be on top of the crate, one over from the corpse. 
---
 Its not unknown so some server hopping might be needed, but its not well known. ;)
---
Bed Bath and Bethesda
---
Looks amazing, be proud of your work!
---
Bethesda needs to know that not everyone playing this game wants Fallout 76 to devolve into yet another MMO.
---
Killing high level legendary enemies will drop legendaries at either 45 or 50 (since these are the two highest level brackets for legendaries). Weapons go up 5 levels at a time pretty much
---
I‚Äòd normally advise you to ask customer support
---
But Bethesda‚Äôs ‚Äûcustomer support‚Äú is the only one I have discovered  to not ‚Äûsupport customers‚Äú at all 
---
I thought the whole reason of no human NPCs was to not confuse players if that person is a hostile NPC or a hostile player.
---
That‚Äôs plasma cores, fusion cores are under chemistry.
---
I have two of them now. Just waiting for my dog to equip it on... any day now...
---
I have yet to have a PvP encounter where I wasn't getting 1-shot
---
Because no matter how much I love Fallout 76, I will probably play other games by the end of the year. If the item I might pay cold hard cash for isn't available to buy until the second half, I might not see it and the miss out on my sale.
---
The current business model seems to be, push a few items that might be attractive to some people, make the price so high that you have the \*REALLY\* want it to spend beyond the free atoms. If the transactions were actually \*micro\*, then I would buy a lot of things from the shop and actually enjoy that content and give Bethesda money. As of right now, I would probably enjoy 1% or less of the content they will push there.
---
These aren't the droids we're looking for?
---
the atomshop version isn't shredded, that's the only main difference. 
---
So can't say the atomshop version is exactly the same as the one you can loot.
---
Explore the Forest before you go to Morgantown - Flatwoods, yes, but don't rush the storyline. Lots of greenery and low-levels to hunt down. Also - there's a couple of lookout towers in the Forest - go up to the top and "activate view".
---
Not all locations are marked, hence the go explore. Downed satellites, downed vertibirds, seemingly empty flattened tents... 
---
Claim workshops even if you don't want to keep them. You'll get plans and supplies.
---
I thought the same, I have kaspersky and malwarebytes, both of them come up clean.
---
I can't explain why alt tabing works for me.
---
The game has eluded to this a few times with searching for survivors. Also some of the hollow tapes you can find talk about people turning into ghouls and not being feral.
---
Consider that just because Wooby exists doesn't mean wooby has a voice actor.
---
FO76 was deceloped in about a year, and writing dialogue and paying actors to record their voices is the most cost-intensive and logistically difficult part of developing BGS games. The whole *point* of FO76 was making a budget experiment that originally wasn't even going to be a full game. I hear a lot of dreams about what this game *could* be, and not a lot of willingness to see it for what it is.
---
Point taken. I do agree with your approach. ;)
---
Thanks for letting me know! I was hoping to look a bit [Lady Mary-esque](https://media.glamour.com/photos/56964d6c93ef4b09521054b1/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/fashion-2015-12-downton-abbey-lady-mary-best-looks-6-main.jpg) with the hunters coat, but alas!

BoS mod to combat armor gave rad resist in fallout 4.... 15 per piece I think 
---
Skip all of this advice and go do Line in the Sand.
---
Use your fresh cores to go explore. When you get low go do Like in the Sand. When you're tired of Line in the Sand get some flux and make overcharged Ultracite fusion cores.
---
I'll see you in two days when you can't explore because you're overencumbered in fusion cores.
---
Exactly!
---
Better Translation:
---
"Offer me things right now at a price I might actually give you money for instead of releasing them later in the year when I wont be playing this game and you get zero."

"Lower the price so I can buy 5 things for $10 instead of buying 0 things for $0 dollars"
---
At the end of the day, there is an equilibrium price and I think they could make more total money by reducing the price so that a reasonable person would actually buy many things from the store instead of very few things.
---
Yeah. At least give a warning shot or something. Or an unarmed punch. Especially when the guy is 50 levels above you. That's basically AFK killing. I hate that shit.
---
Z/C on keyboard. Just as annoying to PC players since the slider is annoying to manipulate with a mouse
---
Awesome, half expected some Charred Feral Ghouls to come at you! I think Bethesda does GREAT environmental design, replication and ambiance. Playing Fallout 3 was amazing since some of the locations I grew up around in game and being able to compared them IRL.
---
So much for culture.
---
..... Ultracite fusion cores.

Activate ‚Äûpacifist mode‚Äú in your game options

Perfect for the obnoxious melee-ranged gunners like me.
---
Even for items/skins that are in game but time consuming to get I'd pay 500-1000 atoms (since I've gotten \~5000 since launch for playing). For example, the T-51 Nuka Cola paint. Or the Hot Rod paint. Or anything other than a 'Child's Play Time' paint. Really? In the apocalypse?  
---
As it stands I've bought exactly one item for a crazy high amount of atoms - $7.00 Nuka Cola stash box skin.
---
Just for lady point on friends taking the bounties for them (like most do). Best way to go about it is anyone on your friends list for the past 72 hours regardless if you remove them. Can not clear the bounty from you.
---
It honestly wouldn't take too much work to fix most of the PvP issues. They've already started by nerfing TSE weapons and Explosive resistance for Fireproof resisting explosive things.
---
One of the 2 biggest things that need to be addressed (besides the bobblehead bug) is slap damage calculations and gear mods; both legendary and regular mods.
---
With the slap damage, having it percentage based was a huge mistake. This is mainly due to the way Fallout games calculate damage through resistance since most of the time standard resistance hovers around the .5 mark. Adding a max slap damage modifier would easily fix that. The intent seemed to be lots of hits to murder someone with slap damage. If a modifier made it take no less than 10 hits to murder, that solves that issue. The issue isn't the PvP in general, the issue here is mechanics that allows the OHK slap damage.
---
Gear is that other huge issue. Someone spec'd and decked for PvP (even more so on a team with shared perks) will almost always beat someone who is dressed for endgame PvE, even more so against PA PvE users, which is asinine. Having Assassin's mods mutually exclusive with things like Hunter's or Troubleshooter's is a horrible choice. Making all damage mods on legendary gear **also** include the 10% and -8% would make that gear a lot better and something to consider actually using at end game levels. It would also remove the Assassin's mod from the loot table, which I imagine only caters to a very small subset of the player base. Regular mods to reduce damage from players would also go a long way to improving the game. I'd sacrifice a couple Deep Pocket mods to be able to functionally defend my base against griefers. The issue isn't the PvP in general (or people who want to legitimately, the issue is having to choose between a good endgame build for PvE or a build to fight off griefers.
---
On that mention of base griefing, someone not being wanted and still having their base griefable by other players is probably one of the worst player interaction design choices. There is almost no legitimate, non-grief reason to be able to walk up to a CAMP and blow up a person's shit. The only thing you get out of it is a wanted level and that's not a deterrent to griefers as far as I can tell. In this case, the issue is the PvP. There's no reason for this mechanic if the player isn't wanted.
---
tl;dr: Recalculate slap damage, allow PvP stats on all gear, stop non-wanted base griefing.
---
What‚Äôs special about them?
---
Behesda couldnt code code that did that even if they wanted to, hell for all we know they tried but its broken along with everything else :(
---
We're not doing anything about it
---
I could see this working as a mod you consume but not something you would always be able to do.
---
You completely ignored the first part of my argument. You're painting Bethesda as some antagonistic entity that resists doing *anything* that we want them to, when that's not the case. I guess I'll post it again, since you seem to be lacking understanding of my argument. 
---
&gt;&gt;Response 2 - FOV Slider
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;FOV Slider: We haven‚Äôt supported FOV sliders in our previous games as it is known to break a lot of animations and causes a lot of clipping to occur onscreen. You do have the option to zoom out in third person on PC by holding View and moving the mousewheel, but we won‚Äôt be able to have it for first person view. 
---
&gt;&gt;As you can see they had zero intention of adding FOV sliders, basically saying we haven't done it in the past, it's hard, and oh btw, here is a workaround to change your FOV for those of you that are getting nauseous playing the game. 
---
&gt;They didn't "basically" say any of that. They literally just said that increased FOV causes graphical glitches, which it does, even with the slider. This is what the person you replied to was talking about. Bethesda didn't "basically" say that they didn't want to include an FOV slider because it was "hard", just like we didn't drag Bethesda "kicking and screaming" to put these things in game. This is stupid, unnecessary overdramatization. 
---
They're crafted from fusion cores.
---
You can indeed recharge, in fact overcharge, fusion cores.
---
Cause the "settlement is under attack" quests were so fun in fo4
---
I'm on xbox and haven't really had any problems at all.  Last night I played for 3 hours in previously troublesome areas like Watago and  blast zones.  I even claimed multiple workshops, which used to almost guarantee I would crash within 20 minutes of the second being claimed.
---
I heard a lot about west tek
---
The only thing I'm worried about is the precedent they set by nerfing TSE weapons because of PvP. The new PvP servers will put even more focus on balance that is going to effect PvP players who could not care less about PvP, instead of just balancing PvP and PvE separately like Destiny does. 
---
I'm also very worried that PvP servers will be our only new content for quite some time. If all they do is nerf my best weapons without giving PvE players any new content, I will for sure stop playing. No reason to keep going if that is the case.  
---
Anyone seen if there are any specific problems with GRX 2080 drivers for this game or something. I am getting desperate. Will do a reinstall of the game and drivers etc and if it does not get better i am off until next patch i think
---
Can you put those in your power armor? Or is it specifically for the ultracite gatling laser
---
Only to make those sweet rolls when you didn't intended to l

---
Glassed Cavern is through a loading zone.
---
Power Armor doesn't seem OP to me - it seems a nice middle of the road choice for those too lazy to build a set of nice legendaries.  Until Power Armor starts getting legendary effects I think it's probably inferior to a maxed out high end set of legendary armor and appropriate perks to go along with it.
---
Uh, technically .... Manually putting in PA used to crash the game....
---
But it will use them out of your inventory. Same for non-prime Gatling Lasers.
---
Mod? You can just drag the cursor to an amount you want out if the box. What we really need is the ability to type in a quantity. 
---
It has a 33% chanche of dropping and it always drops 1 of 3 and never one you already have. so doing it 3 times is 100% rate ... the only way that could be true is if you don‚Äôt read the plan when you get it and got the same plan 5 times then finally read it.
---
But statistics would be insanely funky on that happening
---
I got wind then the fusion and didn‚Äôt bother with nr 3
---
With the right build and equipment, these do a lot of damage and are very tanky.
---
I've never played FO4 myself. All I could find was this:
---
- https://i.imgur.com/aeNbEGH.jpg
---
So you might be right! Maybe Combat Armor is SUPPOSED to have a bit of rad resist.
---
Yes very, if u have adrenal or bloodied then yes
---
Now that's something I can agree on.
---
https://imgur.com/a/tm8R6zh this gear x 5 pieces. You won't kill the bugger before he kills you even if you can stagger him before he kills you.
---
Bethesda need to know a lot of things, however they are busy working on there next cash grab ....erm game.
---
Once they have something else to sell us they will be in touch.
---
Where you playing today? Got there and someone had set up a camp with a wooden platform and 5 turrets facing the island. I swam across, sniper at the claw, then swam back with him chasing me and let the turrets finish him off.
---
The hazmat suit gives you 1000 rad resistance 
---
Still take radiation damage - reason Bethesda math 
---
Accidentally purchased the Christmas bundle for 2000 atoms while checking it and I also tried to reach out Bethesda about it (No response though) . They're not likely to refund the atoms unfortunately.
---
I think the lack of NPCs means Beth was more inclined to put detail into the ones they included.
---
I put it on a rifle stock and use Commando while making Godzilla noises.
---
It's pretty murderous.
---
Where do you find plasma cells? I think I only ever find them on the occasional ghoul.
---
The entire point of two is the second shot without ammo. Also, the nerf isn‚Äôt for Two shot, it‚Äôs for Two shot explosive so considering your caption you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about
---
The premise of FO76 is that it's a microtransaction platform rushed by management and cobbled together by freshman engineers. You know why Todd said "You're the NPCs?" Because he knows how expensive voice acting is. The story and contents of the game are not determined by some ephemeral Fallout design integrity (of which there is no evidence for at this point, given the state of everything else in the game that violates lore and themes), but rather by what was technically possible to implement as quickly and cheaply as possible. It's really sad seeing people making excuses for one tree and have no explanation for the forest.
---
this exact thing happened to me with my x-01 calibrated shocks. I had them in my stash and farmed steel to finish building the legs and when it must not have registered my scrap split between two places because i crafted my legs and my shocks were gone. i've spent about 5 hours server hopping since and haven't come across another pair...
---
They're one of a couple of builds to strive for when it comes to legendary armor
---
If you want the damage its worth it, but as you said if youre already one shotting wjats the point?
---
I use it on low damage high firerate weapons like miniguns and gatling lasers to make them more playable since the game is highly skued towards high damage low rate weapons.
---
If you one shot a mob with 300 damage then 900 damage wont make a bit of dofference unless fighting SBQ.
---
Thats my 2c.
---
* Don't Horde.
---
* Endurance isn't a tank stat (More than 8 will hinder most builds).
---
* Charisma 4 improves quality of life overall.
---
* Don't try to "Multi-class". Two things is fine, look through perks to see what's compatible.
---
* Assholes may destroy your things, don't worry too much about it, everything is fixed easy enough.
---
* You can only vendor, at max with access to all vendors, 1400 caps a day. Vendors don't recoup all caps from selling.
---
* If you want to keep a legendary for another character, make that character and Google "*Transfer items between Character FO76*".
---
* Scarp everything you don't want to use right away. Scrap all junk all the time.
---
I am sure they are working on it
---
It‚Äôs just they aren‚Äôt good at communicating or conveying their plans 
---
so the 2nd shot is nerfed, or explosive in general?
---
Equal opportunity Assaultrons?
---
Gratz.  
---
I've been able to kill a few on my main but I got my first SBQ on my alt.  Still excited to get that one as well.
---
Not if you cripple their legs.
---
It‚Äôs not super clear completely yet, but in general the effectiveness of having a TSE destroy everything is being lowered, not having a two shot weapon
---
If they wanted to make money in the ATOM store all they have to do is add AI companions, bam, infinite money.
---
I wonder if that's where I got the BoS cammo outfit I had for a minute...
---
Same. But I was pretty sure it was Grahm and I‚Äôve been confused because everyone calls him graham. Mandela effect much?
---
This is really cool, thanks for sharing! I have a few in game buddies that are from West Virigina that keep telling me how accurate it is but these pictures totally blew my expectations away. Especially the tennis court/club house area which is almost a 1:1 recreation aside from the shruberry/mulch area and the fact that they rounded out the fence around it so people don't bump into it.   
---
Just a funny note, my buddy swears that West Virgina is super small and that fallout 76 is most of the map of West Virginia (he is from West Virginia).  He was probably drunk right? I called him out on BS immediately but he was so persistent that it was most if not all of West Virginia that I was left scratching my head. lol  
---
I mean even just searching for West Virginia's mileage states  24,038¬†mi¬≤ in comparison the FO 76 map is 16 square miles. I chalked it up to being a tall tale of a native of West Virginia.  
---
Thanks again!
---
I found a dog helmet. I can't equip it even though it's armor and it looks like it'd fit on a dogs head so... where's my dog?
---
No the second shot is to increase damage, also the nerf will individually effect both effects
---
I agree, I was saying that if PA didn't use a semi-rare core that adds weight and degrades over time, the weight buff, defense stats, 0 fall damage, STR buff, and environmental protection would be OP
---
Interesting, thanks for the reply. I'll keep an eye out and see if I notice the same patterns. I'm on an X. 
---
Yeah, I think that's original to the game. 
---
I fully collected 3 and was getting progress on others on one char; when I switched, my progress was totally reset. 
---
Two shot without the second using ammo is the point. Regardless of what the nerf is this makes 0 sense
---
Nope. I've got a furious pipe pistol that's level 1.
---
Cleared it 2 times solo at lvl 19, easy mobs and not that much work, just takes 50 minits the first time because you don‚Äôt know the route and i didn‚Äôt get the control room location and wasted time on the optionals.
---
2nd run was 30 minits.
---
You do need a hazmat suit for 1 room but i think we all have one by now

Saving level ups will stop you from unlocking new perks.

Melee, with no perks, is strong for awhile. Use it to save ammo.

Fast travelling to vault 76 is free.

Don't stash power armor if you get higher level pieces. They're plentiful. Also the first PA you can use is at level 15.
---
I know this thread is old, but did you find out wh the usage is so low?
---
I am having the same on my 1070ti, and frames sometimes drop to 50s, I see no reason for that since it doesnt use all the resources.

i hope every one of your Type quits lol
---
I remember wanting to do full shadowed but the extra rad resist of the BoS being the one thing I kept debating about (in fallout 4)
---
If you're wanted and don't have enough caps for the bounty you get a -50% pvp debuff for an hour. 
---
Pre-War Money is not a fun trinket to collect anymore. It's just scraps for cloth. Unless you specifically need the material (unlikely) skip the overwhelming urge to pick it up every bill and bundle you find.

Also, what platform are you playing on?

meh maybe I'll go try it.  For science.  I know how to do it. 
---
In the case of mine it was horrible dad with a stepdad to follow up as a father figure, the important part is YOU are who YOU are and that‚Äôs all that matters
---
Your first line told me all I need to know. This is a (light)survival game, not a hoarding game. Change your mindset and your behavior. 
---
It‚Äôs like me going to a soccer game and asking why they don‚Äôt have 3pt shots. That‚Äôs not what game they are playing. 
---
No the point is to do double damage (from the second shot) but making it use ammo would balance it because the insane power would be balanced by high ammo usage
---
XB1 here. My left trigger will move it past zero and start at the top again.
---
sometimes 2 (rarely 3) and once there was four
---
This is getting weirder and weirder now, yeah - haha. 2 possible bugs.
---
This whole disaster of a game is for suckers. I cant believe anyone bought this. Its your own fault.
---
Not my point, my point was all of the characters were unique, Neil Vs Marcus, they were similar but neither of them made the other less special. 
---
Open the photo, clear any interface and screenshot it with the console. I think ps4 screens it automatically when you take the picture. 
---
I missed that. Great to hear. 
---
I think it matters less what is called (agree with the dictionary of course) and that it get fixed.
---
The "level-locked" thing is probably the most frustrating. What is the point? I'm level 63 and there are many plans I've never seen in the world, vendors, or been rewarded with. And some of them, I never will now. 
---
&gt; You completely ignored the first part of my argument. 
---
First of all, ironic, given that you surely wouldn't have had enough time to read through my comment and post this.
---
However, for the record, I'd forgotten, as you can see I was planning to based on my opening comment "I'll start with the second part...".
---
&gt;You're painting Bethesda as some antagonistic entity that resists doing *anything* that we want them to, when that's not the case. I guess I'll post it again, since you seem to be lacking understanding of my argument. 
---
They were. Once again, you weren't around then.
---
Of course I'm not saying they've resisted EVERYTHING but look at what their said about the slider you quoted again. Bear in mind the context was that people wanted the FOV slider due to getting nauseous playing the game with such a tight POV.
---
&gt; We haven‚Äôt supported FOV sliders in our previous games as it is known to break a lot of animations and causes a lot of clipping to occur onscreen. 
---
We haven't put an FOV slider in our games in the past because it breaks things.
---
&gt; You do have the option to zoom out in third person on PC by holding View and moving the mousewheel
---
Here is an alternative to use to possibly deal with your nausea.
---
&gt;but we won‚Äôt be able to have it for first person view. 
---
We're not going to give you this feature.
---
Tell me again how my saying that they had "zero intention of adding FOV sliders" was in any way a. incorrect b. over-dramatised?
---
You really want to continue this? You're on the losing side of this man. I'm not saying this because I want to "win" but the facts just do not support your case.
---
So about melee... get out of range... mines... or  anything cryogenic 
---
I get it too, I think it's a broken texture file or the code calls for the wrong texture
---
We need dog meat there are Lone doggos and KitKats roaming the wasteland and they need a home
---
Do you happen to have the numbers for breakpoints when using max rank critical savvy along with the +15% crit meter fill affix?
---
Why are you trying to balance out legendaries that are perfectly fine? Legendaries are supposed to give higher power and if you‚Äôre going to take away the legendary effect it‚Äôs just a regular gun
---
Duh they'd be on separate servers. 
---
As it currently stands, we share the world. Nukes are like rain in a drought. Everyone comes out to get theirs. 
---
Website Xboxdvr u/Codkid036 mentioned seems to work better. 
---
Alright, I'll give you a valid reason why it should NOT be automatic: Holding breath drains AP and those are important for various builds and situations.
---
Sometimes I zoom in with the scope and hold breath right away to aim and shoot, sure. Sometimes however, I first want to use the scope for reconnaissance first, deciding which target I will kill first, roughly sway to it, then hold breath, and after the shot often immediatelly follow with VATS and I want as many AP as possible left after that first scoped shot.
---
Builds that don't use VATS will typically have less agility and therefore less AP, so even if you don't really need them afterwards, you don't have too much time for holding breath. This is even true on PC with mouse/keyboard, and for sure more so with the wonky console controllers.
---
"Are you really going to scope and not hold your breath?" This statement shows that you're totally oblivious to the fact that AP drains while holding breath. Initially I didn't even bother to explain why it's a bad idea, thinking it would actually be self evident, but no shit right? Doesn't seem so for you.
---
I do however think that it should be optional: giving the player game options to tick on "auto-hold breath in scopes", if it's really that bad for controllers.
---
This is Bethesda though, they don't even bother about the possibility to rebind hold breath in the control options.
---
If i don't see it happen then its not a thing right? - many gamers over the years.
---
Me not playing the game is the most childish fallacy ever. Plenty who have played the game had the same perspective as I do, I just didn't spend money on the game.
---
Everywhere you go, the reviews are bad. Majority of the people do not like the game. You are in the pool who will watch the game die while you play it over the next year. 
---
You are a fan boi. Its not an insult. It means you will give Bethesda money for anything that has "Fallout" printed on the box. Your age doesn't matter, its a concept.
---
The only people asking for your type of opinion is the guy selling the product. They need you to make them a sale or two. If the product was quality, they wouldn't need your opinions to make sales. Your idea of a miserable life is disingenuous. You revealed how much of a fan boi you are. You think that someone's life is miserable because they didn't play Fallout 76. This is why you will never get it.
---
The proof is in the pudding.
---

You get grouped with those people on servers that share your ping range 
---
I once joined someone‚Äôs server for trading and met a lot of new people, but the game lagged badly 
---
Yeah I'm 90% sure it's bugged. Never been able to get it to snap correctly.
---
BoS + leaded + 25rad_legendary in 76 is I think supposed to give +50 resistance per piece which means maybe nuke zones in combat armor? would be pretty...rad
---
I honestly have no idea why they havent followed through with this, given if I remenber right, you can get some scorched killer weapon mods that basicaly turn your gun into a legendary weapon?
---
Seems easily like the best solution, could have drop plans from boss mobs like scorchbeasts, have them as super rare drops from events and so on.
---
shutting down the turrets before getting into the room by hacking terminals makes the whole thing much easier and faster. Every major  turret filled room has a terminal just before the room to shut them down. Also less wasted bullets
---
In regards to where people are suggesting to claim workshops, stick around for about 1-2 minutes, because there is almost always a defense event shortly after claiming it.
---
That happened to me when I bought 2 Brick sets by accident. Only 400 caps total, but that was a lot at the time. :p
---
I think part of the logic is that people don't use Heavy Guns largely *because* they (and often their ammo as well, looking at you Mini-Nukes &amp; Missiles) are so heavy that you can't set them aside for later. And that was very common practice in previous Fallout games, pulling out the goofy heavy guns for a laugh or when you find ammo for them. They tend to have more niche use, and are fun to bust out, but it's currently unfeasible to stash them even for just long enough to get some ammo for them.
---
I'm a HW user who carries them constantly, but I'd like to be able to store them easier too. They only weigh a couple lbs with the Bear Arms Perk but it's hard to justify the huge space they occupy in my stash when I'm low on ammo for them.

What's the difference between frequent server hopping and a long boring grind?

I don't understand why you don't just play and hope you get what you want? If you had these items now, what would you do with them if not keep playing anyway?

I would be fine with keeping it how it is but as of now Bethesda is going to be changing the damage gained from the effect from 100% extra to 25% extra in the next update.
---
So harsh. Im scum because i play in designated pvp areas. I dont port to your house and blow up shit. Im not out looking to get a bounty. I claim workshops that is designated for pvp.  I dont understand why you pve players wana play in these pvp workshops then cry when you get killed. you dont even know me dude. Last week after i stold a workshops and killed the previous owner a few times i dropped him tons of plans and recipes and moved on to another server gave him back his workshops. Im not some huge assshole i just wana pvp a little make you work for that workshops. Most of the time i don't even take a players junk when i kill them unless there being little pricks. You all have totally misjudged me. I have an idea how about you just dont claim workshops if all you wana do is play pve.

No perks are needed but weapon artisan is recommender

Nice build! My camp has been in the Forrest on top of a copper deposit for a couple of weeks but i‚Äôm looking to move into the Cranberry bog area to have artillery coverage. Camp building is my single favorite thing to do in the game. 
---
Yeah well at least this one is at a set location it's at riley clay's bunker in the workshop area
---
The big got much easier to deal with once I mutated marsupial.
---
This is wrong.  They are nerfing two shot AND explosive.  The damage output of both with be reduced.
---
no, i think your life is miserable because you are spending your free time, on a subreddit for fans of a game, telling people the thing they like is trash. Instead of doing something that brings you joy, you are spending your time telling people that they are wrong for enjoying something. Or maybe that in and of itself brings you joy. Either way, sounds pretty miserable to me... 
---
They're just crutches.

100% more damage is rediculous.

I don't have a legendary handmade rifle yet so I'm not overly stressed about it. I'll get it eventually.

Theirs no point in it if you ask me. What fun is the game if you just wreck everything right away with overkill? Just to say you can? 
---
I only remember Marcus. But that's probably because I was more of a fallout 2 player. Broken hills. We need to arm wrestle with Francis.

PvP players can launch their own nukes if they want to get legendary gear.

Tap the trigger and dont hold it, it will stop at 0 (and then with the next tap roll back over to max).
---
Yeah, that would be sweet. Maybe they removed rad resistance from the BOS mod as to give Marine, Trapper and Robot some more space to shine, though. BOS Combat already definitely has the best B/E resistance.
---
For the effective or removing the TSE benefit. They will reduce it but only to reduce effectiveness of this and Two Shot weapons should be rather unaffected compared to the strat itself
---
They will help you.  You just have to submit a ticket.

Does that actually work? Can‚Äôt players just ignore you or switch servers? 
---
Na, FONV corrupted saves, lost followers, and killed critical npc's.  This is mildly annoying bugs in comparison.
---
White spring resort more like holy shit why are there always nukes here oh fuck oh god someone help me I‚Äôm too low of a level for this.
---
Please explain to me in detail how reducing two shot prefix from +100% to +25% is not nerfing two shot?
---
Dupers dont care about caps, they have stacks of 28013245 bottles of nuka cola and a lead belly perk, to work around the limit. Caps economy isn't real until Beth deletes any stacks of nuka cola over 1000 units.
---
Sorry mate and thanks usually get hate for it. How do I make an imgur and why does reddit not just have the simple feature of adding an image üò¢
---
nope, not fixed
---
Nope! still a garantueed drop from sentrybots. For some reason robobrains were dropping them, which is what got nerfed/fixed 
---
You craft them at a Tinker's bench. 
---
Uh this is a loot based game.
---
Rng is going to be the cornerstone of getting good loot.
---
I suspect we'll get Moe activities to more pulls on the spot machine.
---
Simply put ppl that are geared up now won't see more progression for awhile as duping and ebay were never intended forms of progression.
---
The bright side is a copy sold is a copy sold. The ppl taking the slow intended route will have more fun.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen anything like that either. I‚Äôve only had one player offer to sell stuff and I got the artillery plans for 100 caps. I mostly just give shit away to low level players in Flatwoods.

---
Well, yeah, but.... I was hoping you knew of drops.
---
Did you try Commando with the rifle stock?
---
Small note for this, Fireproof also blocks explosive damage. +45 at 3\*, I believe. 
---
3\* Fireproof completely negates car explosions, so it should defend against other regular things. I know this because I also have 3\* Ghoulish and punch cars with my Power Fist to refill my life. Heals about 100-120 HP/s with no rad resistance (+9 rads). It also makes SB's White Lag Ring attacks do no damage.
---
So that **might** allow you to remove Dense from your Torso, would need to actually test that against rocket launchers and such. Anywho, this could allow to you add Pneumatic to the torso and reduce staggering for Sentinel armors.
---
Im saying Matty also made a shitty leak video
---
I think weapon crafting was the weirdest thing to me after playing 4 for so long. You aren't just scrapping copies of the same weapon for parts, but for upgrades. 
---
Armor crafting feels non-existent in the early game. Plan rarity for armor is real.
---
Leveling is weird. You can separately choose a SPECIAL attribute to bump followed by perk card (they do not have to be the same). I still fuck this up regularly. I think that UI blows.
---
Vats and crits are similar once you get past the "its not slow time anymore"
---
FYI: 2 weeks in game time so 3-4 hours real life time makes the wanted status go away. Last night i had a 300 caps bounty and no one came. It ended up going away on its own.
---
I was under the impression that once an item is offered it is in the store for good. So the store is always growing in Stock.  
---
I think the pace it's coming out is fine. Everybody wants everything right here right now, but then what is left? They have to pace how they put out new skins and stuff because each new one puts new stress on the game and severs.
---
It's just a bunch of nightshirts and kiddie skins anyways. And you can't really use playing other games and missing things as an excuse, it takes 2 seconds to pop the game on and check the store, hell,  there is a post on here every time there is an update and everyone discusses it. Check that. 
---
I‚Äòd pay Atoms to not have the pipboy on my arm in third person 
---
Two shot damage is being reduced from +100% to +25%.
---
Explosive damage is being reduced from +100% to +20%.
---
if you see a power armor frame, jump in it. If it has pieces that are too high level for you just transfer them out and drop them. Power armor frames will give you increased str, damage resistance, radiation resistance and negate fall damage. 
---
And if you find a frame with pieces that you really want to keep just take off the pieces, enter the frame, exit the frame, put the pieces back on, and then collect the frame. All frames weight 10 lbs regardless of the weight of the armor pieces so you can save them that way. 
---
I just ran a silo solo. Someone killed the queen before I could fast travel to it and finish loading. 
---
I keep my friends list trim, so I know when no one else is online that I know, and I join random sessions and I see the same names I‚Äôve seen all week.. something is up.
---
I‚Äôm on PC and play daily and I see 2-5 reoccurring names I saw on my session the day before. Been a couple weeks of this now. So yeah I feel maybe I should be a little concerned.
---
If you were on PC I would've definitely given you serums for you lost mutations, bud!
---
I spent a weekend there in '09 (worked on a summer camp in FL for a season then travelled for another 3 months on a J1 visa), someone in the hostel suggested the place. I'm not usually a hot dog fan but *fuck me sideways* it was good eating
---
I prefer to be called a 'Chally-Pally' thank you very much.
---
I think having a group of wanderers who follow Grahm to hear his 'deep thoughts' is pretty great though. Maybe Grahm started off at the New Age temple location lol
---
Some.of the floor tile sets for camp look pretty sharp.  ;)
---
So it‚Äôs possible to carry more than one keycard?
---
Very well said buddy.
---
Exactly how I feel. They chose, for whatever reason, to completely reinvent the wheel with almost every aspect of multiplayer. I don't know if they were just being lazy or if they thought they could do it better but the end result is completely antiquated.
---
&gt;it's more like they just dumped a bunch of random ideas in there and hoped for the best
---
They pretty much said that exact thing in the No-Clip documentary.
---
If it's a bobble head that will effect your weapon damage, it stacks. 
---
I just assumed this was an intentional move from Bethesda to try to get people to spend their massive cap hoards.
---
Yes it‚Äôs mind boggling 
---
They had numerous updates but didn‚Äôt fix that one 
---
The Fallout wiki on Fandom has a breakdown of the numbers through experiments. I will assume that rad resistance mechanics in FO76 works the same way as in FO4.
---
The numbers on the Wiki imply an exponential decay of the exposure. This makes sense, as in reality, you would use a formula like the mass attenuation equation. Fiddling around with the numbers, I noticed that Bethesda might actually have used this equation (though significantly simplified). As I haven‚Äôt been able to pin down the exact coefficients they might be using, I don‚Äôt dare to make a definitive claim. Work in progress.
---
Table with experimentally derived numbers:
---
Xbox one :) 
---
Where are you guys getting this info lol
---
Must never of played a game like this before
---
clearly it is a feature and not a bug xD
---
I believe it is calculated the same way as FO4.  
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Fallout_4
---
There is really only one way to overcome radiation damage and that's through perks.  
---
All of the armor and meds in the world will still have you taking &gt;1 rad per second as the resistance  never overcomes 100% of incoming damage, but it may be so minute that you won't care.    
---
So, to answer your question, if you walked into a room that was 5 rads/sec with 100 resist, you'd still take about 1.1 rads/sec.
---
Thanks so much for all these comments, if I store crafting materials in the stash are they automatically accessible when in build mode? Or do I have to take them out of the stash to build in my camp? 
---
Happened to me exactly 8 times since I started Queen runs a month ago.
---
Depends on your location and the server you join. I'm put into servers with fucktard exploiters.
---
Yep -50% damage won't stop it with things like this.

"My point is segregation is wrong!" 
---
Goes on to argue FOR segregation for the rest of the thread. 
---
The annoying thing is that it wouldn't have happened if the game didn't bug out and disallow me from joining this guy's group. 
---
Pretty sure this the the final state of the game. /s
---
well there is no refrigeration or canning(unless you count mama dulces) available. So food going rotten quickly is pretty normal. 
---
Don't have the points to spend right now while leveling, but I'll try to at some point. Probably on my main since his build's pretty well solidified.
---
And the result is that they didn't develop either system. It's like starting to make a chocolate cake and then half way through deciding to make tuna sandwiches instead, and in then ending up with tuna flavored brownies.
---
... I can live with this answer, at least.  Still a bit off IMO, but there's other items to concern ourselves with.
---
Melee build with a good weapon can 2-3 shot Scorchbeasts easily.
---
When they land, of course.
---
Well the corpses I always found in them in Fo4 leads me to believe they don't work
---
Nice. Good info, thanks :)
---
They don't work at all 
---
You understand the words ‚Äúfeels like‚Äù? Was opening a conversation, not an empirical debate.
---
I played TD from launch up until not long after the infamous 1.3 patch. Jumped on to refresh my memory of the story this weekend, and holy shit it was like playing a new game. So many QoL fixes, new content. If Massive/Ubi have learned from their mistakes (god please have learned) i think the sequel should be a pretty fun game
---
They are often based on the level of the enemy.  A level 42 will drop 35 and 40,  a level 1 legendary (they exist) will only drop level 1 items
---
This is why nuking Whitesprings is popular,  When nuked most the mobs are over level 50 and will drop top level items 
---
&gt; The bright side is a copy sold is a copy sold. The ppl taking the slow intended route will have more fun.
---
What does this even mean? Even if you take the game slow, once you get to the end-game there is little to do but pray you get a weapon/piece of armor that is of a usable type (not wood or a pipe pistol), has a usable legendary effect (not more dmg against robots etc.) and has more than one legendary effect. The odds of that are so insanely low it's not even worth trying.
---
Ps4 classic and 1 crash in about a month. Server drops and crashes aren't the same thing so idk if that's what you are experiencing. Those happen a bit.
---
Yeah I got 5 on me, not sure if there are any issues, I haven't done a nuke but I have had them for sometime no issues, also you can mess up a card if you type a wrong code, so I think it is best to have more than 1
---
[The Full Story of Pulowski Preservation Shelters - Fallout 4 Lore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz3iZ87WJXc)
---
You're on the right track. I've seen lots get it first try, one guy I ran patrol duty with at least 20 times before he got it. Good luck!
---
You really think the only endgame creatures besides *hordes of glowing ghouls* should be easy to kill? Maybe instead of looking at it like "me no like guy with too much health," you should look at it like, "why isn't anything strong worth killing?"
---
They could bump leg drop rate or at least grant a guaranteed 1-star. The game's systems are robust enough that there are plenty of solutions that don't involve sliding the difficulty scale all the way to ultra-casual.
---
But, as others have mentioned, there's options on your end. Understanding the AI is first so you know how and when to engage them. After that is knowing how to optimize your build, level 50 doesn't really mean anything. Lastly, 137 isn't really a lot of damage, if you want to kill them quickly you'll need some meta legs. After the nerf though, I expect a lot of people are going to have complaints about TTK on SBs.
---
We could have a group of ghouls take over the maintenance of the Poseidon power plant and replace the workshop with a small town. Maybe a bartender we can play a minigame with. He'd be a jerk though.
---
Just northeast of Point Pleasant there is a mountain pond with a staircase and dock. It can be a bit tricky to build around in the rocks but I had a pretty sweet camp there for several weeks. I was able to build right alongside the walkway leading from the bottom of the stairs to the dock for a near seamless fit. There is enough dirt for gardening and a picnic table is included at no additional charge!
---
Just fyi, "bluescreen" for the PS4 actually is basically the same as CTD, it's just poorly named because PC users are so familiar with the much more Infamous Blue Screen that computers do. Whereas the PS background for an Unexpected Error program crash is blue so we call it that too lol. 
---
Tl;dr -&gt; PS4 "bluescreen" = PC "Crash To Desktop"
---
I have seen the doormen do that as well.  It was neat that they added an animation for if robot legs are broken
---
The name is so litereal. It is an island, there is a deathclaw there :p
---
To be fair, if there were a lot of deathclaws there I would be farming the crap outta them. They are like one step above ghouls as far as threatening enemies go. Buff deathclaws!
---
It surely is rushed, but they have to follow this design decision, because it's one of the major concepts that define the game. Take it as an excuse or not. 
---
I found myself an Executioner's (+ damage when the enemy is below x health) minigun recently. I think it's gomna be a good contenter for the new "meta" prefix once the TSE nerf hits on ranged weapons
---
Excuse you, what about the Prize Bot?  We have PLENTY of NPCs!!!
---
Edited the OP. Either it‚Äôs just me, or reddit gives you a silent downvote for editing too of thread posts.
---
My Anti-Armor lever action can take them out in 5-6 hits with sneak attack criticals.  
---
This is incredible thanks so much for sharing, made me happy to see how faithful of a recreation this is.
---
It‚Äôs insane that Bethesda hasn‚Äôt advertised these kinds of things more.
---
Seeing this, and the mothman real life statute has been awesome.
---
I did 10 Agility builds every playthrough because of that sniper rifle. Best gun in the game.
---
I think that's the whole point of them. Fallout 4; most you open would have a dead body inside. I think it's meant to be a comment at the government giving a false sense of security, much like during 1 of the World Wars people were told by the government, if there's a gas attack, you're safe if you hide under a table and put a blanket over you (in real life)
---
Hmmm. Can‚Äôt find you?
---
Would have been sweet if it was like the Deathclaw promontory, maybe even some baby deathclaws, with Stripe mixed in for fun.
---
Grahm is so much fun! It really is like hearing the ice cream truck XD
---
Not a problem, I got them back with a little time invested and some luck. Thanks for the thought! 
---
Lol, I'm playing a post apocalyptic survival game where I can be a literal cannibal and the best I can say about the shop items is "some of those linoleum tiles look nice."
---
This is a month later but this is the only place I have been able to find this clarification. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough idk. Someone should make a post about it if there isn't one for the imbeciles like me that don't understand it lol

I have, and it doesn't work. However, I did charm the Flatwoods Monster, into being my pet for a while.
---
This is actually a pretty common strategy in the games-as-a-service space, especially when the game is planned to have a long support cycle. Basically, they only sell crappy items at launch and for the first few months to a year. This is how they fleece the absolute whale customers who will simply buy anything. When better stuff comes out later, it's more exciting to the skeptical players and they're more likely to buy something cool that finally dropped after waiting patiently for six months amongst the periwinkle gun skins and brooklyn dodgers hats. This way they get the whales buying more and increase the likelyhood that everyone else will eventually buy SOMETHING.
---
What part of what I said was cheating? This is without bobbleheads. It is just perk cards and the gun
---
You are going to die A LOT....junk items drop from your body when you die, if you know you are going to die try to find flat ground... paper bags are hard to find in grass so are corpses.

If you see a high level near vault 76/ the overseers camp or Flatwoods there are either a griefer or going to help you. Usually with weapons/armor or healing stuff etc. 
---

tedious.
---
I think you have to stand in open or something as well.  I can dump does of shotgun rounds from cover (with overhead) and the just hover in place.  Only exception I've found is if they spawn a pod of scorched, killing the pod trips a landing.
---
You can pacify them by using the Wasteland Whisperer by it's only temporary. The funny thing is if you do pacify them they actually get an interact button on them so they can talk to you. Unfortunately all they say to you is "Go away, bleeder". I am hoping one of these days when I do it they actually hold up a conversation...

Story answer:  You use boiled water to cook irradiated foods because they already both have rads.  Why mess up your clean purified water on irradiated food?  You need that clean water for medication.

Real answer:  They didn't feel like making two recipes for everything.

It means the obsessive no life group of players will be onto their next obsession before the casual crowd is even at the end.

I see it all the time in game. I partied up with a guy that got the game for xmas.
---
He was level 15 after 4 weeks of playing the game.
---
I think so, you find him by some dead bodies and a shack, and a note for  someone to feed him. I think he is an orange Tabby.
---
Awesome. I like to think of 76 as "Fallout with Friends" - it really is a rich and lively environment it you pay attention to it. It doesn't spoon feed the story, it makes you work a bit for it, but it is rewarding when you do. If you'd like a teammate to travel with that is just as big a fan of FO4 (and 3, NV, BoS, Tactics, 2 &amp; 1), I'm always happy to help. GT: UberToast
---
what a silly thing to get worked up about
---
if nothing else the turrets that require perks should be better.  
---
If I need to invest in 3 science perks and 3 home defense perks, and then waste 90% of my budget on a camp that has 8 of those top end turrets, that should be something that wrecks enemies that come close to the point where a coordinated attack with multiple players is required to take down the place.
---
I don't know how you live your life or process information, but nothing about this situation has anything to do with users "spending your free time, on a subreddit for fans of a game, telling people the thing they like is trash"
---
The topic was on the front page of reddit's tabs. I didn't search it out, It appeared in my feed. The topic is about thoughts on Fallout 76. Which were supplied. I am a Fallout veteran too. 
---
You have no clue on how to approach anything in this topic. You just want to complain about people giving factual accounts of a low quality product released by a company. This topic was created because the OP wants to counter the opposite opinion.
---
When the waiter brings your meat raw, do you just say, "Oh, they know what they are doing, this is how it is supposed to be, these guys know high quality, and know what they are cooking. Trust the chef here, its the first time they have cooked before." I would not eat there, but you can continue to try and convince people that eating raw meat is a great thing. You'll get a few to join the cult.
---
On a final note, what degree difference is there between the OP saying bad things about the game and another user? OP stated
---
No, I'm level 16 and I've been wearing a couple of legendary armor pieces since level 10.
---
I was experimenting and traded around for a couple bobble heads of explosive, ballistic and heavy gun. Pop one bobble head, check weapon damage. Pop second bobble head and see if damage went up. Don't need 1000 to see if they can stack. 
---
Grafton in fallout  looks nothing like Grafton IRL

---
Lo someone didnt get the memo. The posts have been many. TS TSE and Explosive weapons are all getting nerfed.
---
Don't drop items.
---
I did it until the bag dissappeared now i never do it
---
I realize this is a bit late, but always drop a round of ammunition first to make sure a bag spawns. Sorry you had to learn this way.
---
and that's for the base effect right? not just on twoshot+explosive?
---
There's a joke running back at least to FO3 about how terrible they are.  Most of them have skeletons in them in various amusing positions.  I particularly like how they're coin operated -- reflecting both their cheap origins, and suggesting a sort of grimly funny moment where nukes are coming down and somebody's desperately checking their pockets for a quarter.
---
How can it be direct? 
---
Btw, how long do the paper bags last?
---
The funny part was on my death screen, the guy who I was trading with was like yoooo wtf? Where did he go? haha
---
Just give me a few,my little guy is acting up.lol
---

---
Exactly! I gave up on them. It takes 10x longer for an enemy to destroy a single wall segment then it does my missile turret. Ridiculous lol
---
I mean i keep it unlocked for people to take. 
---
My non-existent doors are open for any traveler.
---
YES! I would much rather upon up my wallet to Bethesda for a companion, even if it didn't do anything, than a 20$ Santa Outfit.
---
It confuses me as to how Vault-Tec let so many sociopaths into a control vault. They're usually really good at weeding out undesirables.
---
&gt; this is a loot based game. 
---
where you have to abandon 99% of the found loot due carryweight/stash limitations...
---
this is why my friends and i always drop one round of cheap ammo first and then put items in the bag, even when trading other more  explensive ammo. lost around 2k rounds of .50 cal once because we didnt remember to drop a bag first. 
---
Automatic 
---
Having a goal to work for by actually playing the game is far more fun. Having a progress bar that shows that I am getting closer to my goal is a good motivator. As is you could hop all afternoon, for hours and hours, and still be no closer to your goal. It is not fun.
---
&gt; **You completely ignored the first part of my argument.**   
---
&gt;First of all, ironic, given that you surely wouldn't have had enough time to read through my comment and post this.
---
Lol half your post was giving me sources I asked you for, and the other half was telling me I was just wrong and "losing". Not a lot of reading required. 
---
&gt;However, for the record, I'd forgotten, as you can see I was planning to based on my opening comment "I'll start with the second part...".
---
Tbh, judging by the end of that post, it did seem like you got flustered and forgot what you were saying. Still, the first part *was* ignored.
---
&gt;**You're painting Bethesda as some antagonistic entity that resists doing anything that we want them to, when that's not the case. I guess I'll post it again, since you seem to be lacking understanding of my argument.**  
---
&gt;They were. Once again, you weren't around then.
---
Why do you keep making this assumption? [I've been posting here since before launch.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vlir4/i_think_ive_hit_the_jackbot/e9eadgh/) And Bethesda has not resisted doing absolutely everything fans want. Like, Jesus, they never mentioned faction-based PvP until the community suggested it.
---
&gt;Of course I'm not saying they've resisted EVERYTHING
---
You literally just said "They were" in response to my assertion that "You're painting Bethesda as some antagonistic entity that resists doing anything that we want them to." Maybe I'm being pedantic, or maybe you were looking to just dismiss my statement?
---
&gt; but look at what their said about the slider you quoted again. Bear in mind the context was that people wanted the FOV slider due to getting nauseous playing the game with such a tight POV.  
---
&gt;*We haven‚Äôt supported FOV sliders in our previous games as it is known to break a lot of animations and causes a lot of clipping to occur onscreen.*  
---
&gt;We haven't put an FOV slider in our games in the past because it breaks things.  
---
&gt;*You do have the option to zoom out in third person on PC by holding View and moving the mousewheel*  
---
&gt;Here is an alternative to use to possibly deal with your nausea.  
---
&gt;*but we won‚Äôt be able to have it for first person view.*  
---
&gt;We're not going to give you this feature.  
---
&gt;Tell me again how my saying that they had "zero intention of adding FOV sliders" was in any way a. incorrect b. over-dramatised? Remember, FOV sliders are in the game now.
---
You said that we had to "drag them kicking and screaming" to get the feature in the game, and that they said that they ruled it out because "it's hard". They literally never said "It's too difficult to do" and nothing they did say ever implied that. You're mischaracterizing what they said.
---
Hell, the whole assertion that we had to "drag them kicking and screaming" to add an FOV slider in the first place is up for debate, considering they only said no once, then they added the feature. In my mind, "kicking and screaming" implies an extended period of vocal resistance. They said they couldn't do it one time, before adding the buggy FOV adjustment setting we have now. That's not "kicking and screaming".

Hi I don't know why you seem to not understand, but that is okay dude; there are many good guns, lots of different tactics. please reread or something, fuck just read the title.
---
"individuality" "What makes you special?" I've never been under the thought "if you don't play like me you are bad", I play my own way. many do better playing to their own strengths. That is why this game is very hard to test. 
---
the bunker buster is not even a weapon you need to grind for and with a simple stabalizer mod you can hit marsupial, speed demon, jet packers out of the air.
---
mininukes, cryolator &amp; flamer combined;
---
fuckin' if somebody can 1 hit you through passive mode, plop your camp down and start building brick walls, then you take hundreds of caps from them.
---
if they have so many items you're game is freezing just leave, but if you can kill them do it. and build around their bag, don't touch it. you gotta be quick, but now they are fucked. cheating only makes you look better until it makes you look really bad, and it never really makes you better.
---
I understand if you like these weapons, and now are sad because you feel like your grind was a waste, but think about all the people who spent real world money. what was anybody thinking? because the guys who were fuckin dupin that shit were definitely laughing so hard, they must have known that having everybody in the game using this gun would make need a nerf, lol.
---
dude I keep coming back and seeing what you say and realize you haven't even read what I wrote. doesn't feel nice, other people are telling me they're confused and I'd like to clarify for anybody who doesn't understand but you not seeing the big picture here. take a step back, I am not saying any games are bad nor am I saying mistakes haven't happened. remember something brings you back to this forum. are you here to influence or be influenced mr  worked so hard for your TSA; just to let you know though auto versions of that mod are probably better against humans, so you have a leg up.
---
but yeah i'd take ya out any day with ma reg ol' bunker busters, with stabalizers, i hope the extra one I got at white spring wasn't yours.
---
I'll upvote it to set you back to 1.
---
Respawn time is once per week though right? So you can only do one farming run per week.
---
I have lots of atoms and keep looking in the shop, but there's nothing I want to buy.  I was thinking maybe I'm strange, but maybe lots of people think the same!
---
Retro-futurism is the entire aesthetic of the franchise, kiddo. 
---
Hey I love my fishlamp and starlet sniper outfit and my succulents and my pink castle bed. I'd also like faction stuff and nostalgia stuff!  There is no reason why we cannot have all of these things, yea.  Some of these complaints can come off really crappy like they're saying ewww, stop selling those girly things and home decorating homey things and start selling more military coolness that is better. I'm just pretty tired of ppl punching down at one another's gaming choices and enjoyment of things and not keeping in mind that there are other kinds of players that play this game.

Removing targeting HUD has been a known fix for a lot of people for a while now.

They were named differently before the update. alpha deathclaw and a few other types I‚Äôve seen in there, typically level 30-40+. This is definitely the best deathclaw spot though IMO. There‚Äôs a yogai corpse outside the cave that frequently has the typical loot on it as well (screws I believe?), then two guaranteed deathclaws right inside with no other distractions. 
---
But isn't that the point of a Fallout game? When it's most fun? The found rather than the pointed at? I play for an open world where I'm free to discover things without a guide. Sounds like what you want is a theme park ?
---
Grats!
---
So what's your ign?
---
You win, fucker. Upvote. 
---
Bethesda is disgrace!
---
What were there Q n A doing hey?
---
Looking at this list there's some very basic stuff on here that should have been caught. almost 3 months since launch and the only communication we get is "Oh we gonna tell you stuff soon(tm)".
---
Disgusting that customers have to compile these lists and even worse that Bethesda wont ackowledge the majority of the broken features or bugs and even worse wont thank these guys for doing this. Too busy counting there cash hey!
---
Got 4 consoles in  the house and 1 decent gaming PC, me my kids and whoever else wants me to buy them games wont buy another Bethesda product again unless of course its pre owned so Bethesda never gets another penny out of me unless they start acting soon down to the way they think they are above there customers.
---
Oh no.
---
Am I officially not the last person on earth any more that remembers "Woops!" or are you talking about another show? :P 
---
Sorry - Frithelstock Stone
---
I think that the issue is that you have to harvest the DNA from the corpse while it's inside the glowing circle around the fissue - which is incredibly fucking stupid because that means you have to be sure to kill it when it's right over the fissure and that the body drops within the circle. fucking REALLY Bethesda? Dealing with Scorchbeasts isn't enough of a pain in the ass without having to deal with this piddly bullshit?
---
I would like to think that one of the vaults would open up and let all the folks out and just like the 76ers they'd pick factions and take over workshops and camps and such. Or at minimum wander around randomly like Graham.
---
the outside area  looks really nice. are you on xbox ? i have a spare nuka cola machine plan you can have 
---
I want to pop out of the bushes at the vault as every level 1 walks out and SCREAM from my mic - NO MATTER WHAT - TRADE ITEMS - DONT DROP THEM! And then speed demon chameleon myself backwards into the brush as my terrifyingly helpful public service announcement. 
---
Lolol, very true statement.....my "kitchen sink" is a part of my drug lab lol
---
Just what I was missing! /s
---
it's like a vicious circle.
---
you have to farm stuff to make a powerfull caracter in combat, quests, pvp‚Ä¶  but you end spending all your time in farming activities...
---
I still do it all the time. I just drop a blank Holotape first (no weight and useless), make sure the bag spawns then transfer whatever I want to the bag.
---
Same issues on PS4, NOT Happy! You made it worse not better, I had not crashed until latest update, 10mins in BSOD and again......&amp; again.......ect. cant go neat watoga without crashing. 10 min double loading screen is killing the game for me.
---
I bet they're dupers.
---
Not at all. Just log into a new session and the nodes are there to be farmed again.
---
It's older but i still feel its with in the range of "Equivalency" to the minimum "required" cpu.
---
looks like your house is balding
---
Memories of Liberty Prime.....
---
God, I've been trying to complete this stupid thing for ages - So you have to make sure the body drops right over the fissue? I mean, fucking REALLY Bethesda? Dealing with these things ins't enough of a pain in  the ass, now I have to make sure I kill it and that the body drops in just the right place first? JFC this game is beyond idiotic sometimes.
---
Powered up monongah, with two randos.
---
Go to claim workshop, randos come shortly after,  stop claiming because they were at the plant first and let them have it. They give thumbs up, I walk away to a nearby daily. They claim it and 2 scorchbeats attack. Go to help defend it. Randos bail my level 50 barey handling the two beats, GRANT SHOWS UP AND HOLDS IT DOWN. He keeps one busy with his club. I take care of the other. Randos come back. Kill second scorchbeast. Look for Grant, gone as mysteriously as he came. Can't wait to see him again to shake his hand.
---
I'm on for a minute if you still need one. 
---
Does this come in text form
---
Robots are lame
---
And it sounds like what you want is a casino. If you want to discover things just don't look at the guide. I want to earn things, not just stumble upon them by blind luck, or really a combination of the two. As is I have a better chance of getting cool gear by killing some random golf ghoul than killing the big bad boss of the whole game.
---
The same people we pay our caps to when we fast travel. 
---
I got that from the title (was expecting a tutorial on spawning the queen but not having to fight in a rad zone), but the post itself makes me firmly believe that, if he's frustrated with anyone's recent nuke launch, it's his own.
---
Speak for yourself man. 
---
You don't have to experience something to have a valid opinion on it.
---
Murder
---

---

---
You are clearly narrow minded. Everything I listed can bear opinions without experience.
---
Your idea of you can't comment unless you played it is a real shit show of a perspective.
---
Nope. Everything but golf skirts, straightjackets, and tactical marine helmets sell for a single cap.
---
Nah, sunshine oil for the sweet 400 ap.
---
Well yes that's the black hole of online game end games. Unfortunately. All other games seem to do is move the goal post and come out with more powerful items and enemies so you keep going round the circle. Few games have improved the formula in this regard. 
---
I remember Ultima online used to have curated events where studio employees would play act the parts and run real full world one time events with custom stories, items, monsters etc. 
---
I wish more games did that or something like it
---
Not sure, I know Oxhorn is pretty thorough however so it may exist. 
---
Preaching to the choir!!!
---
The isolation gets to me.
---
So do the drugs.
---
Do ya wanna buy a house in the woods?
---
It‚Äôs more like an assumption then an actual ‚Äûfull story‚Äú made by a YouTuber 
---
I think why Bethesda strays away from to many NPCs is because they're fragile. Either you have a bunch of immortal NPCs running around, or you have players griefing the NPCs to mess with other people's progress. 
---
Was this last night on Xbox? Saw some dude demolishing someone's camp over and over. So I killed him lol... 
---
Try capital o? 
---
Not in bags, in containers
---
The idea is improvement is possible. It's not like 76 will remain in a terrible state.
---
Another thing to consider is Rad resistance for the purpose of not taking **additional** rads. The concept would be to get your rads up to 60-ish% so your health would be low enough to activate, and keep active, all low health effects from thing like Nerd Rage or Bloodied.
---
It also adds a couple of extra options like Radicool for strength or healing using Ghoulish + rad intake from dirty water by popping a single diluted Radaway. I had a build that utilized this, it works okay.
---
Well the crazy amount of damage they dealt seems to indicate to me they were probably staying tons on bobbleheads 
---
I'd love either the Borderlands weapon to "grind" items together to produce a new better item or to be able to scrap Legendaries and have a *chance* of getting a legendary mod. Also, let me do level upgrades on Legendary items (Lvl 15 -&gt; lvl 45) if I have the ability to craft the base weapon, similarly to how the Mystery items are handled.
---
You won't get banned for mods, you will be banned for hacking
---
I had a very similar experience yesterday.  Lower level dude, mask, creepy voice in my camp. Comes up saying all this schizo shit then blasts my SO (only lvl 23) in the face with a weapon. I immediately pummeled him and left the server. Not worth dealing with.  
---
Can‚Äôt right now, holding the hunters long coat vendor hostage for anyone who wants to buy the long coat and clock plans
---
No.  A few people have asked on Twitter and the only response is "Fallout 76 does not support mods."
---
Good observation but no I don't favor the rng either. I simply want emergent stories with related quests and logical rewards. I don't want to be pointed there but I, like you want a guaranteed reward when I find it. 
---
The worst example was the gauntlet in Ultima online and killing the dark father. Good God I don't miss that
---
Haha no, last weekend.  Had a few run-ins with real douchebags, and I'm taking this game very slow and savoring every level, so I'm way underpowered compared to the dickwad contingent.
---
Glad to know there's people out there bringing some justice, though!!!  Thank you!
---
If they actually made them not like shit, sure they would have been. Having more than like 3 npcs show up would have been a good start.
---
A blanket? That's ridiculous. Everyone knows blankets are only good for hiding under to ward off monsters under your bed. 
---
This is a very open ended question. Just search youtube for a basic introduction into the issues with the games.  Sort by date and you will notice a huge trend of never ending problems with the game.
---
What is the old ring tho?ü§î
---
I ran into Grahm last night, his inventory was full of cool CAMP items, I had a pocket full of caps... and then my partner accidentally unplugged the wifi router because they wanted to tidy up the cables D:
---
Knowing my luck Beth will have a Massive ATOM Store BLOWOUT and EVERYTHING I ever wished for would show up...$200 later I am still thinking of buying MORE!!!!
---
24 hrs later
---
 Beth announces the immediate shutdown of Fo76 and launches Fo5 with multiplayer servers!
---
Maybe that's the fix for duping.  4k caps? Really? 
---
Hear hear! I feel like good dads teach you how to be and bad ones teach you how not to be.
---
God....those things I swear to god have more DR than most power armor suits.  Tse.  375 damage....25 rounds later he's at half health....like a scorch beast but easier to hit
---
I especially love the fallout series for this cliche and satirical jabs at big government and deregulation extremes where money directed public policy. Every time I read something in fo76, I can't help but associate it with something I heard on NPR, CNN, or Fox. I love this game. 
---
Following me around now?
---
You gonna do the same as your toxic butt hurt buddy and hunt me down in the game and wreck my base?
---
Can it be identified on the map as the "deathclaw fuck pit"?
---
I noticed this too and accidentally attempted to sell a few missles to a friend for 25k. 
---
There wont be any end game, have you ever played a Fallout game? It's not an mmo, it's not wow.
---
They might add on dungeons and build more upon the game but you are way off it you're looking for an mmo experiance
---
Really? I thought they only started at level 5. I didnt know this, thanks!
---
This. Hubby and I learned the hard way to always drop a "scout bag" before dropping the important stuff. Sometimes the world just likes to eat your stuff, especially when it's something important to you.
---
Gonna let let him go in 9 mins, at 20 past the hour
---
Even that has probs. That trick normally works but 2 times the bag has disappeared on me when putting a second item in it. Now I just use the cumbersome trade menu.
---
Sometimes I get that, or if the ememy is walking backwards they suddenly become impossible to punch.
---
Well as long as you *feel* it's equivalent to a vastly superior CPU then what can anyone say? 
---
Yes please!
---
we do, personally i launch about 3 a day.  it would be great if all the PVErs stayed out of them, but we arent so delusional to expect that to happen.
---
Ok, wise guys... Try making the excavator armor (34 blk tit, 38 oli, 50 springs and screws, 60 glass and 46 rubber, all necessary to create the excavator armor. Then encountering 3+ lvl 32 robobrain sentries, assorted protections  AND a lvl 42 assaultron domi ator (with a crown) annot dying enough so your junk disappears. 
---
I used 2 nuka grenades, a shitload of. 50 cal (M2 machine gun), and then 3+ clips from the Perfect Storm. That damn assaultron finished me off just a few HP before it died.
---
I respawn, make my way down to R&amp;D, only to find it all gone. I died &gt;2 times before I killed the assaultron and found a bag w/2 items,so no excavator.
---
Feature my ass. 
---
Well we can agree on that. For example, I was disappointed by the Ultracite power armor because it just shows up in your inventory for no reason; some people didn't even realize they got it. There should have been an involved quest line for it similar to the Excavator armor. That would have made for some fun endgame, chasing down the plans and pieces for the Ultracite, rather than it just being handed to us.
---
Also while in PAssive mode ANY explosive bullets you shoot should not hit players in front of you and end up killing yourself.
---
All in Passive mode VATS should not target and player character.
---
Ppl got banned for using a mod that would highlight plans in the game world.
---
I'd lean away from ones that change sb's attacks.
---
People say bethesda is breaking lore then they suggest this
---
yeah, rifle and melee really don't synergize. You need too many points to be effective at both.
---
Melee and HW/Shotguns/Explosives can work, or even with pistols although they're not very good. All of these mean perk swapping to be truly minmaxed, but that's easy on PC with perk loadout manager, and they use mostly the same SPECIAL points so it works.
---
If you're a horder.
---
So you don't view his inventory when he comes around?
---
This!
---
When it comes to rads the mistake everyone makes is to use them to keep health at a low level all the time. 
---
The better way is 
---
In no/low radiation areas,  use rads to keep health low 
---
In high radiation areas, cure the rads the hell up and use something else (like enemy hits to bring down, and very disciplined use of 10%-a-pop dilluted stims to bring up to the right amount) to keep health at 20% or wherever else your perks/mutations/legendaries require it. 
---
holy crap Bethesda Replied!! GUYS WE COULD BE GETTING T.O.W.N.S!!!!
---
Scorch beasts take more damage than they do. Can drop them easily on the ground. It's just waiting for them to stop spam so I can see
---
My isp has a feature called ip passthrough so my ps4 is wired to the port that bypasses the device.
---
A switch would work too or any business grade service could do it i assume.
---
Thanks for this. 
---
100 % agree
---
Can confirm that with rifle stock it gets buffed by Rifleman; I use one as my panic weapon. It melts through everything, even itself!
---
Are they going all TES on us with magic rings?
---
I found a Wedding Ring sitting near a caravan in the middle of nowhere...have to go find the spot again to be sure.
---
If you go stealth rifle-VATS crit build, those "big numbers" on melee become meaningless.
---
I can roam nuked Whitesprings in a hazmat suit and sneak headshot half the ghouls before the melee guys can even reach them. The club itself is problematic due to the tight quarters and massive spawns, but if I sit on the bus outside I can pop them as they come out... if I want to. Kind of shitty for loot for others though, so I usually just spam a tesla rifle. But the potential is there.
---
Oh definitely! I love inventory management on games,especially survival ones. I think the big issue here is that the game is all about crafting but doesn't give you ample room to store your crafting mats, even in your stash. A bigger stash would work wonders. 
---
3 nukes a day?
---
You may not be delusional but it sounds like you're probably Vitamin D deficient..... LOL.
---
After seeing the new Metro trailer I really feel that they have to do something differently. I'm not saying abandon it, but really overhaul it. It's starting to feel like thesius' engine.
---
thank you :)
---
I want that armour! Ad victorium brother!!!
---
Damn I read that as the One Ring. 
---
I don't think this is the case. If you have 3\* Fireproof, a SB's White Lag Ring attacks do no damage, it's always consistent damage at 2\* as well, accounting for the extra damage a crit will do.
---
The speedy attacks *seem* like the SB is getting stuck in an action script. This happens to the SBQ as well but is normally an action script that causes her to hover before new actions and she'll hover there for a good 5 minutes doing nothing. 
---
Much like breaking the SBQ by crippling her wings and resetting the landing script you can break the SB out of his spam by looking for and killing all the Scorched adds he spawned the last time he took off, that will trigger his landing scripts and usually override the spam.
---
No worries!
---
He still there?
---
No my C.A.M.P is on the edge of cranberry bog these days on a junk pile resource. I was up there til around lvl 30ish i'm lvl 101 now so live nearer the action.  I loved it up that end there. The forest is my fav area just no challenge up there now for someone of a higher level. It's a bit too peaceful up there lol. 
---
I have a 2 shot gatling plasma i added the beam spliter mod to. I got so excited because after i added that mod when you shoot it its like green fire coming out of the barrel. I thought cool, I'll take it to white springs and see how many ghouls i can melt before it breaks. I was very underwhelmed by the lack of damage output. I think it somehow got worse than a normal gatling plasma.
---
for future reference whitespring resort is the place to go. Has every crafting table imaginable, a stash box, and vendors for selling extra items. Plus a bonus of usually a few players nearby so that you can hopefully get that bounty removed after stashing your junk. Going to your base is pretty much asking for it.
---
No clue. Maybe for an election.
---
That interactive map is hella neat. Props to who ever made it.
---
To add, the Big Bend Tunnel directly parallels the whole robots vs people subplot.
---
Samesies. It's worth quite a bit of atoms. Hope it's fixed in time. 
---
How much for the .44 rounds?
---
Yes still here with him
---
It's definitely a "different universe" thing.  The fusion powered cars emit radiation - that wouldn't happen, they'd just leak water.   
---
I‚Äôve been looking for the wedding ring too, would be interested if you find the location!
---
Yup 
---
I believe you are right though 
---
Will keep this in mind for future endeavours.
---
Happy to help. It's survival so we're all in this together!
---
Most likely going to be used in future Enclave content.
---
Why? Looking for re-election, Mr. Speaker?
---
Gatling plasma was my go-to SB killer around level 50. I'm 127 now, and use a TSE gatling gun for non-queens, and a prime armor-piercing gatling gun, but I still carry two plasma gatlings as well.
---
What are you saying? This is the house of the main character in fallout 4?
---
I thought so too but i had several lvl 1 legendary items after a bunch of eyebots spawned in whitesprings. Only happened once have not seen it happen again.
---
75 caps? 
---
No my man you will be fine been using tonnes of mods for a long time now. So has all our clannies of Steel Rain. The only ones things took issue with was Reshade and Cheat Engine. As they were used to exploit the game.
---
Interface mods are 100% fine.
---
same for me and the 2 buddies I was playing with yesterday :( 
---
Still around?üôÇ
---
Or same amount of .45 rounds. Whichever you have. 
---
I like it, the explosions are cool when it happens
---
Just watch for accidentally making good robots mad or triggering PVP
---
I was surprised to find it as well. 
---
I wouldn't mind them pushing the Atomic Shop so much if it actually had half-decent stuff that people asked for. It was neat at first, now it just seems like they went through the game before release, removed a bunch of random shit, and now they're trying to sell it to us.
---
In regards to the crashes with exception code 0x00000005 that's most likely bad/lazy programming (its a null pointer error), same as the ucrtbase ones with 0x00000409 (stack overflow aka trying to access memory not owned by the application).
---
Odds are they will need patched by the devs, not a windows patch.
---
This us what I love about the game. Y'all can feel welcome to stop by our state any time!
---
Great list.  I would add the following:
---
Event: Protest March, quite often the mobs never spawn.
---
Workshops - invisible/disappeared workshop enemies preventing the workshop being claimed.  I have seen this multiple times in the past week at Lakeside Cabins, where the quest markers are there but the mobs can't be seen or shot (usually 2 or 3 of them) so the workshop is impossible to claim.
---
Doesn't matter, this is a total bust
---
Yes still here at 24 past the hour :)
---
I got one when I looted the well dressed rad roach in the house on the road north of Camden Park
---
I get that, the only high radiation areas I usually find myself in are Nuked Whitesprings or SQB fights.
---
With Nuked Whitespings almost everything deals rad damage so HP doesn't drop to much if you're stacking Diluted Rad-X with a Hazmat suit. With the SQB, Fireproof blocks her ranged and Blocker mitigates half of almost all damage you'll encounter (save for the rare Scorched with a pistol).
---
In both cases I still used Ghoulish and dirty water to heal and Diluted Radaway to focus in on the rad range I needed to control HP amounts. Either of our ways works provided you have a system.
---
People have a very hard time understanding that Bethesda considers this an mmo. I have yet to play any mmo ever that let me modify values for in-game. Js.
---
1/23/19 still no answer
---
Ah I really wanted to do this! Sorry! Helping people get this rare vendor
---
Thanks for having me!!
---
I was in the thread and had some time to kill. Idle hands and all. 
---
I mean, again, all of what you described is only possible if you have used a workshop. I have never been killed by someone claiming my workshop if I never had one in the first place. Its a PvP element added to the game and people are getting mad that people are engaging in PvP. Ya know, its intended design...
---
Everything ok?
---
Slightly off-topic but something I have been struggling with for a while. I am absolutely shit at building things. I have the visual and spatial awareness of a rock. How can I learn to build anything half as nice as this? Am I just doomed to have a pile of work benches and junk strewn about like a trailer park? Or is there a guide or mod or soemthing to help people like me build nice CAMPs?
---
I'm still in the server when your done
---
well, let me know if you want me to hold him so you can server hop few times
---
PvP servers and stability and i‚Äôll be happy for awhile 
---
I can post a video that was taken by a stranger. 
---
Of course I do, but that‚Äôs not the highlight of meeting him. He is an experience on his own, listening to his knowledge of meat always makes me happy. 
---
They must have broke it with the last update, sadly probably wont be fixed before the weeks over, maybe not even the next update.
---
Probably future content?!
---
everything is great. I guess I was inaudible? I was saying that you can leave and join the sever so renew his assortment, and I can hold this bot for you so you can find what you were looking for.
---
I remember talking about killing the scorched the SBs spawn and was ostracized for thinking outside the box on that. A lot of people said that they tested it and it worked to make them drop and a lot of people said that I was crazy. 
---
I was not saying that this is the case at all. I am just starting a weird coincidence that happened and I thought it was something to ponder on.
---
Yeah plenty. And you can't just kill people with slap damage if they have literally any healing items. 
---
Server hopping multiple times is fucking paranoid
---
Maybe.
---
As long as its retroactive, I like it.
---
No I‚Äôm good, I got the coat and the clocks first time. All out of caps now anyway :)
---
Excellent job.  I like to build in mountains for most of my characters but have had the same problem with all.  2 out of 3 times I fast travel I teleport into solid rock.  Then have fast travel a couple more times until it works.  Have you found a way to avoid this?
---
Marsupial + deep pockets + armor pieces with plus 1 Strength
---
I also did a drop test and discovered that my biggest problem was too much Aid, so equipping the right perk card to augment it helped (Traveling Pharmacy, previously thought I needed Bandolier).
---
If I am stuck and can't fast travel because I can't bring myself to drop anything, then I use Radicool or Solar Powered + a plus strength food + a plus carry weight food
---
Doesn‚Äôt the rad suit replace the sentinel armor? 
---
A female Gilbert Gotfried impersonator yelled "we're at the point where I kind of like you" as I waited for the game to load upon about 10 startups and 30 crashes. It got old after about two.
---
There is an unreleased officer uniform in the Atomic Shop:

It's a limited sale item though.

Ah thanks, don‚Äôt have mic on, so can‚Äôt hear. Am all out of caps anyway, what else does he sell?
---
ah, ok :) well, I'll hop the server for the last time then :) thanks, cya!
---
Huh, I was just thinking about this when I saw it pop up again last night... "It's been a few months, I wonder if they fixed the bug where you repair him over and over again and you still lose?"
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
Well, I use Known Plans, because who the hell would keep track of every recipe or plan they learn (retorical). And follow the lines of not altering inputs, visual clues (glowing mods) or perk manager kind of mods, as it's basically a script to do dozens of inputs in 1 second, which give significant advantage in pvp.
---
In practise, Bethesda cant ban thousands of people using QoL mods, cuz then PC players would be playing alone.
---
Mods that alter the appearance of objects or effects in the game world are something I would be weary of, even if it's just changing the sonic attack visuals. While I have no idea their stance on it, sometimes mods like this provide an advantage or otherwise perform in a way that is reminiscent of cheating, and they may not look in such at it in such a way that will separate it from something more malicious, and instead take a harsh stance on it. I personally wouldn't risk it, anyway, unless it simply changed the way the UI looked or something.

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Old_ring

No worries I‚Äôll hang around for a bit longer
---
clean spacesuit, clean straitjacket and mb smthng else. I'm jumping for these 3 things
---
yes plz
---
I would also be happy with other melee things from past games (the Nuka Cola Sign was a favorite - [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nuka\_Breaker\_(GRA)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nuka_Breaker_(GRA)) )
---
If only
---
I think some (unreasonable) people feel like bug reports are somehow an attack against the game. I guess they think it's hating on the game. I've also seen comments telling people they should just "deal with it" or "ignore it because its not that bad." 
---
However it means cores with a lower charge take up dead weight in your inventory. If they pulled from the bottom and worked up, you'd clear out emptier cores quicker and save on inventory space
---
Uhh, excuse you. They are also very effective for closet monsters and dolls that inexplicably creep you out at night even though you play with them all the time during the day. 
---
Ah ok, don‚Äôt think I want those things anyway
---
You know what else really grinds my gears? I'd like to know how it's possible to have a perk card that lets you drink irradiated water like a firehose with no rads whatsoever, yet when I walk in a stream it irradiates the fuck out of me. That makes NO SENSE! 
---
Yes I realize there is a perk to swim in irradiated water without getting rads but still. It's ridiculous.
---
Hypothetical people
---
I've noticed it's actually pretty inconsistent. 
---
Sometimes I get 80c or 57c, then 100c or a 90c. I thought to myself: but why? ü§î
---
I narrowed it down to a few possibilities:
---
1) the next queued is at the top of your inventory list when in default sort. However if you had noticed that when you are moving fusion cores from inventory to stash, say you have 3 50c, move one over, the (2) remains, but when you move the second over, the fusion cores all shuffle to some random setting. The third 50c is neither at the top or the bottom of your inventory list but not where it was in relation to the other fusion cores and you have to scroll through them again to find that 3rd 50c. I suspect this to be the primary reason they are randomly selected, the fusion core is selected from the top but during adventuring it is shuffled upon picking up new ones  When you find a new fusion core in the world or take one from your stash, the inventory of fusion cores shuffles and as such the PA selects the one from the top of the list. I suspect this is why some people don't really see much of a difference while others find it frustrating. 
---
2) there is no pattern. It is completely random at all times. 
---
3) probably somewhere between 1) and 2). 
---
On a side note, not only is it more advantageous for Gatling lasers to be able to prioritize appropriate fusion cores, it's also advantageous for carry weight. I had two fusion cores with 3c and one with 1c in my inventory and my PA switched to a 90c. Which begged the question: but why? 
---
Use TSE weapons, be sure to equip the right perk cards for maximum impact, use chems &amp; bobble heads to buff your damage points as much as possible. Try your best to coordinate your strongest attacks when she's on the ground... This is when she's most vulnerable. 
---
I never understood exactly what enjoyment people get out of ruining someone else's good time. 
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Remove legendaries altogether. Put that shit in the Elder Scrolls where magical items work within the context of the genre.
---
I don't think it will. Most people causing complaints about PvP that make Bethesda think they need PvP server don't want to PvP with other people prepared to PvP (people with PvP armor, defensive specs, and killer weapons). 
---
Most of the people causing the complaints want to troll and grief PvE players. They only want to PvP risk free so they can feel like they're elite killers, when they actually only rely on hip shot TSE's and Sentinel Armor and you can punch in the face 3 times with Melee before they can actually shoot you with their ranged weapon.
---
The player who want legitimate PvP may go to the new servers, but I don't think it'll be a large portion of the servers' populations. And we'll still have the same complaints about grief PvP'ers.
---
So no, I'm not worried about dilution. It'll just create half empty PvP servers (that will probably be pretty fun, actually) and PvP griefers will still populate regular servers because they're cowards.  
---
What platform are you on? We had 6 planned and then randoms turned up too 
---
I want a Cazador house pet...
---
Awesome, thanks for the info
---
Thanks for posting. Would really like to see this get fixed.
---
I do have all the rifle man perks and a ts handmade but that‚Äôs the best I got I‚Äôm getting around 155 per shot
---
Post on here before you launch the nuke, a lot of high levels on here that will give you a hand
---
There is the presidential bunker in the whitespring that is locked could be some potential player voting for a president idk or manipulating votes to become president?
---
Ok thanks
---
Do we love him cause he's good or because there are no other interactable NPCs besides him, Rose and MODUS? But he is an awesome NPC always nice to see a good Super mutant.
---
I‚Äôm old enough to remember the drills we used to do in grade school if bombs started dropping. We would hide under the desk. Either we had magic nuke proof desks or someone made some shit up to comfort the masses. 
---
No luck... Trying to relog

---
Did you get my friend request? You‚Äôre not appearing on my list - will join you shortly
---
I mean, it is more or less like the internet trolls on here. They get some weird fulfilment in their sad lives by anonymously trying to make other people feel lesser. 
---
/u/ManDingoCC6901 I definitely get what your saying, and totally agree. Not everyone should be forced to play the same, that would completely undermine the whole experience of Fallout. However, my point is, is that we all are playing the *same game*. How we play can be debated, *what* we play is a different story. You can run your stash to 599/600 and I can keep mine at 322/600, that's fine. But having it finite is part of the survival aspect of the game. People seem to be complaining about the designed challenges of the game. It's like people don't actually want to play the game. That's my point. 
---
I'm sick of it. I've been trying to get the fusion generator plan for days now. 19 attempts at repairing a power plant. Constantly disconnects, and in between that some shithead with a two shot explosive dragon or some other TSE weapon with explosive bobbleheads 1 shots me through x-01 armor. 
---
I've noticed that it only happens when it's decreasing the amount by more than one unit at a time, like (on PC) if you press and hold the mouse in the left half of the slider area it quickly subtracts about 5% per tick until it goes below zero and wraps back to full.  
---
It does, I was speaking about my build specifically, not your... can I call it a Plexiglass Cannon? Seems suitable.
---
Are you possibly exiting before they have time to load? Sometimes it takes a little bit for their inventory to show up. This delay might be even longer on console.
---
Why???? I could just *barely* understand if someone spent $10 on a rare legendary, but $150?
---
I'm sure the seller will end up dead soon because if this buyer has $150 lying around to spend on a hunting rifle, he's probably well-connected drug kingpin or some shit.
---
RIP, Mr. Seller.
---
No really? You don't say! A fallout game would be better with NPC's in it?! Wow this is an amazing 10/10 quality post!
---
Ok
---
Only 280? I have a TSE Gauss that does 900 something dmg per shot.  
---
Voting.
---
I hate that robot so much.
---
Hm, I am on Xbox but I usually sell all my stuff and then scan through to see if they have anything I want, guns, armor, plants etc. all load in. I‚Äôll hang around a little longer next time 
---
Yep that‚Äôs why I made the post cuz I‚Äôm fine with tse being gone but I want a balanced two shot effect
---
Scorchbeasts need love too.
---
Maybe that's why they're always so cranky?
---
I  think Grahm mostly stands out becuase he's alone, he's about as detailed as most npcs in Bethesda games, usually there are hundreds so they all become forgettable unless they're especially annoying 
---
This argument falls pretty flat when you consider the many, many voice lines they used for the holo tapes. Changing it to a human shaped NPC wouldn't magically cost more. 
---
You're making shit up just like everyone else, so clearly you're not above the rumor mill yourself. 
---
Couldn't agree with you more. BGS made a Fallout skinned MMORPG with many various MMORPG elements such as PvP, legendary effect armor and weapons, and elements of RNG. This has always been the case and was not some bait and switch.
---
And yet everyone that bought this **MMORPG** style fallout game is full pikachu face right now when the game has, thats right, **MMORPG** elements in it. Literally most of the people I see complain directly mention the desire to just play alone peacefully, strictly PvE. I don't think they understand that this game is literally just Fallout 4 copy and pasted but with the "peacefully alone PvE" part removed purposefully.
---
Authentic dog behaviour.
---
Hahah it does :) 
---
If there was a town full of Grahams he, and Rose, wouldn‚Äôt feel so special.
---
I should stop sorting by new. 
---
Have you logged it as a bug? Might just be displaying incorrectly or not work at all
---
I'll look this evening after work and try to post location/directions
---
I dunno, there seems to be a lot of mixed answers. Maybe we should put it to a vote. Oooohhh, that's what they're for! The voting machines are used to vote on the purpose of the voting machines......which wouldn't really need to be voted because that would then be there purpose, but there purpose wouldn't be known until it was voted on, but.....oh my.
---
Funny how this whole conversation started as a civil debate on workshops being forced PvP and whether or not that was fair. 
---
Then it led into how toxic PvP players can be and next thing you know this ImnotJesus guy shows up (a PvP player) and starts being toxic and saying how stupid one of my comments was. Then he threatened to find me in game and wreck my base.
---
Now I've got you trolling and following me around. Thanks for proving my point that PvP players are toxic.
---
This is even better than just shutting down turrets. Lots of ammo saved. Definitely going to do this
---
cost 19 takes 76 out that right there is bs
---
I‚Äôve never personally experienced that, but my brother has multiple times. He had to redo his entire camp because of it. My only solution is that when you first place your camp, take note of where you spawn and build around that.
---
I‚Äôve also heard that moving and rotating the actual C.A.M.P. thing determines the spawn point, but it‚Äôs very inconsistent from what I‚Äôve seen
---
I found one early on but i wont lie my memory is fuzzy and my directions will be vague and useless but  i think it was north/nw of spruce knob. Theres the destroyed monorail. Follow that towards the mountains west. And you should see a skeleton in a chair. There was a note and ring there. I know it was around the destroyed monorail and up higher and was in the middle of the map. Im certain it was in the mountains west of huntersville but around where you can see the old monorail possibly underneath a large power pole. Ill try to find it again tonight. 
---
Never seen a well dressed rad roach!
---
No, sorry, I didn't. The only thing I concluded were that the game probably wasn't (aren't) especially optimized (after reading a lot of posts and reviews). (Poor optimization is usually the explanation when it comes to low GPU usage. E.g.  Escape from Tarkov suffers from the same symptoms).
---
Haven't played for weeks, so I can't tell you if it have improved or not.
---
One example is when I explored the north part of the map (can't remember the name, but the radiated "yellow"ish landscape), my frames were murdered. Staying well below 60 fps most of the time. 
---
(As a reference my rig can handle e.g. Shadow of the Tomb raider (and other optimized games) on Max/Ultra @ 1440p with A LOT of frames.)
---
Good luck! I hope the Devs will look into this and it sorts it out for you sometime in the future üëç
---
It‚Äôs not working at all. No changes upon equipping.
---
You'll know him when you see him üòâ
---
Yeah, but can ya all check out if you have one of these?  I always look for it when I trade with others and I've not seen anyone else with one yet. Just wondering where/how I got it. 
---
Hmmmm.   Are you holding it or tapping?   I just got home but I will fire up the game as soon as I can and update with what happens. I could be thinking of the bumper and not the trigger
---
Thankfully, this issue is slated to be fixed in the next patch, that they're hoping to get out by the end of the month ([link](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019)):
---
*  **Mod Scrapping No More**: We are aware of the aggravation involving mods being accidentally scrapped. Patch 5 will be implementing a fix so that loose weapon and armor mods must be scrapped manually to be used in crafting and repair. 
---
This i will try to find the data mined thread but its linked to a king of the hill pvp type game. The winner gets to be president for abit and gains the pain job for PAs as a reward.
---
Ive also noticed the budget seems to expand the higher your level. I was 45 when I built this one, but yes only have 1 Turret
---
What would happen if someone nuked a city of npcs? 
---
Quite the treat I suppose. 
---
Activated Charcoal can remove some toxins/radiation, so maybe in the process of cooking the food, you actually are just burning the shit out of it.
---
Nope, not for me at least. its stuck there unfortunately
---
First thing my friend and I did was run there so we could compare it. So surreal seeing my hometown and the place I first worked in a video game, let alone a Bethesda game.
---
People complaining about immersion in 3... 2...
---
Pretty sure this is the same spot I'm thinking of. Was worried it might of been a one off but I'd say its a pretty consistent spawn. 
---
i have my ways. But i do not harass or grief.
---
it is really their choice in the end. i make 2k caps worth of kills. u could tag along if u r interested to raid with me.
---
rules in advance, no griefing and no low levels. 
---
Anything else goes.
---
My Xbox account is messed up and won't let me communicate in game. I spent an hour with support before they admitted "yes, something is wrong" and suggested making a new account.
---
Perk: Fanning
---
Ugh one of those bros.
---
Production, medical and genetics has been completely empty last three attempts can only get military to load myself. 
---
Yes, and it all went downhill from there. 
---
Just finish the enclave quest line. Then you get the prototype X-01 power armor schematic and can craft the whole set easily.  Especially if you use the perk cards to reduce the cost. Then just go back to the vendor terminal everyday (or just keep jumping servers) to buy ther mods for X-01 and you will quickly have a bad ass set of power armor. Ensure you use the right perk cards when you craft and you will not have to fix it for a long time. 
---
Of course you being over 200 you probably already know this and are referring to some super hard to get 3 star legendary armor....
---
Either way, X-01 let's all my needs and works great in nuke zones as it provides the best radiation protection. 
---
Good to know, thanks. 
---
Possible spoilers for those who care.
---
As far as I can tell from reading things and such it is to help drive home how far automation has gone:
---
 you see signs that say things like "Save ours jobs or we'll take yours". seems like a threat but it was more or less a push to automate the wv state government. politicians did nothing as peoples jobs were lost to robots so the people were going to give the politician's jobs to the robots.
---
Justba side note I it usually clips into the crate with like a 1/3 of the plan sticking out. 
---
How you guys getting on vextroa and shacham?
---
Dumb question but youre at the command terminal right? 
---
Yeah the 80 dollar version just has a few paint jobs and outfits not even close to worth it to me especially when I can buy atom points and get skins and outfits of equal low quality for what 1000 atoms?
---
Yeah the whole "lvl 50 maxed out weapons" is a bit of a red flag. Maxed out weapons are just a chip off the iceberg if you're looking to dish out real damage. 
---
&gt; **If** bloodied+berzerker legendary combination weapons exist.. (*can anyone confirm this?*) 
---
Doesn't exist. They're both first-star effects, and therefore you can't have both of them.
---
Vampire Tesla rifle has saved me numerous times 
---
Let us go into them and leave behind a corpse that won't disappear for a few hours. Leave some junk 
---
Completely agree. Despite some BS articles recently about Bethesda '*making us pay for items we already purchased in FO4*", I'd like to have some of those workshop items.
---
The more bugs they squash, the stronger they get.
---
Before long, there will be just one bug where you start the game and a Bethesda rep shows up at your house and kicks your wife in the ribs.
---
 ^((Just kidding Bethesda. I know you're trying))
---
I was afraid that might be the case. 
---
Oh well :(
---
No luck... Wanna change of shift? I can hold it 
---
FUCKING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA man

I found it for ya OP sorry took abit. From the sounds of it gonna be something like ESO emperor.

Huh. I swear I played longer than that in that time but it might have been right around 3-4 hours between two sessions. I'm sure it'll happen again so we'll see what happens next time.

It doesn't need it. Nothing really *needs* it. Your build/perks are more critical.

200 hours in and haven‚Äôt seen him once.

He's so loyal. Just waits there. Waiting for us.
---
Good for you for not freaking out when someone came to visit. I‚Äôve learned a lot of plans and had duplicates of a lot of them. Last week one day I saw a couple under 20 people near me and decided to go drop stuff off. Went to the front door of their shack, waved, gave salutes, gave trade emotes... they stayed behind their locked door with their shutters closed and locked as well. 
---
Poor guys, if only they knew I was rocking extra barn walls, brick walls, Advanced Power connectors, etc...
---
Went to nearby Grafton Station and dropped em off on a different guy instead. 
---
Very astute observation. I am still trying to find the "sack hood" and I already am using the steelworkers outfit (clean) but I am trying to get my hands on the normal (dirty) version which is down to RNG in one location. I made myself more barrell-chested, bald, with burns/scrapes/etc on hy head, face, and neck and I'm using the urban scout mask.
---
I've already scared the bejeezus out of a few low, and high, level players.
---
Yeah if you don‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôm gonna get on with stuff!
---
Hell, I‚Äôd be happy enough to be able to pick up red, yellow, blue paint cans and slap them on my X0-1 or T-60 instead of just scrapping them for lead.. like damn, man. They‚Äôve taken so many mechanics that were in the game already and tried to monetize them instead.
---
I like a raider with honor. 
---
Yep that‚Äôs the word I was looking for
---
 Yup its straight up. ;)
---
Like the Whitespring security, where there are 4 or 5 sentries in the entire resort. That means that 1 core (Witch variable charge, of course) is worth 1 to 2 bullets atm if you have a TSE weapon, and you also get 700 XP for killing one. 
---
My beef is for completely different reasons.
---
The reason why they're doing PvP servers sooner than later is to combat the massive amounts of people complaining about PvP griefing. No one is really complaining about legitimate PvP (ie. Workshop takeovers or Bounty Collecting). The types of players these new servers will attract are people who want to legitimately PvP, which in all honesty could be fun.
---
Who these servers are not going to attract are the people who want to use PvP as a griefing mechanic. These types of people are those who build TSE/Sentinel characters and can't seem to hit a man sized target that's not a foot in front of them punching them in the face. Those players don't want to fight people who also have PvP gear and specs, they want to fight PvE geared players. The griefers are cowards who will get their asses handed to them by other PvP'res and will go running for regular servers after about 30 minutes, meaning the PvP servers won't actually help alleviate the current complaints these servers are supposed to address.
---
Anybody else want to try and get it? 
---
Nice. I have a large wooden shack with a few gun turrets, a wind generator, a water purifier, and a couple of workstations. My build budget is maxed out. I can still dream I guess.
---
As far as I can tell, they're *entirely* based on the level of the enemy. The only exceptions would be quest/event reward legendaries, which are based on the player level.
---
Leader of the Pack should be really good for low-level legendaries. Even if there's a high level player in the area, the enemies will be level locked. Maybe Toxic Valley for 20-25 stuff.
---
as previously said, rank 1 weapon cards are the most efficient use of stat points. Once you get all the secondary perks you want between 65-100, then you'll want to tweak your perk load out for Queen/Events. there are a bunch of perks you can use to increase damage that are as efficient or more efficient then base weapon cards and they generally exist in different stats than your base weapon stat. for example, adrenaline/bloody mess/exterminator/glowsight. 
---
I have a Sneak/Crit/VATS meme build (14 PER, 15 AGI, 15 LUK) and still use rank 1 pistol/rifle cards at level 145. 
---
I'm so glad I have never had a run in with a hostile player. 
---
It‚Äôs insanely annoying that people won‚Äôt use a mic. I try to talk to people and get nothing but blank stares.

I just go to the row of terminals in the military wing that sell and buy stuff, I guess I don‚Äôt know that you mean by the command terminal so not a dumb quest ha just me

During the Fallout 4 days I used to watch a bunch of settlement builds on Youtube and developed a taste for it. Pick and choose the little things you like in each build and mash it all together.  
---
Credit where it is due, Cordless VII gave me the inspiration for the [fireplace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQfYwkmFeAY&amp;t=541s). 
---
makes sense , thought so. lol patches always make me redownload the game for some reason. idk why they never play after they download until I uninstall and reinstall. lol
---
Sounds like you want it to be like a game you already know how to play well sorry not every game is like that 
---
Thanks and good luck!
---
Nice 
---
More show up if you have a big party. I was in a party of 3 and 2 deathclaws spawned. Still low level though.
---
Just my personal opinion, like you said, it was a suggestion albeit may be not in line with your personal beliefs. I want more faction oriented stuff or at least lore inspired stuff that actually /makes sense/ to add to the game. The stuff they just added these last two weeks make no sense at all and are ‚Äújust for lulz‚Äù to me.
---
&gt;  You may recall late last year we mentioned we‚Äôre working on a new way of  playing the game that removed PvP restrictions. While we‚Äôre still doing  some tweaking and adding, we thought we‚Äôd give you a little more info  to go on. **Think it of it like playing the game you‚Äôre playing right now,  but with no PvP rules.** 
---
Sounds like PvP servers to me.

So you kinda just watch how they do it and replicate it? I mean I even struggle with where to put the stairs so that they don't lead up to a ceiling or wall. It's kinda pathetic, lol
---
Well maybe I'm way off here, but  I thought the point of F076 was to be an MMO. Bethesda was trying to throw their hat in the arena with games like WoW. They have a lot of learning to do, obviously, but I'm pretty sure that's how the game was marketed, as an online only game,
---
Where at by vault?
---
I went to Posiden and claimed it.  I squatted around the core processor till I got over 30 FCs.
---
You don't even have to piss off Whitesprings.  Take the highway north to the crashed train and you have all of the patroling military robots with a Sentry boss that drops cores, the other standard Sentry drops AND the misc boss drops and treasure maps.
---
Yes!
---
100%
---
That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm doing is cosmetic farming and making new characters to build new houses.
---
Officially, Bethesda does not endorse mods for Fallout 76. 
---
But low-key, I don't think they care so long as the mods don't provide an unfair advantage or hinder server performance/stability.
---
Suddenly the 25$ price plummet makes a lot of sense...
---
Sorry didn't read that correct
---
I dont even have 50 photos on my facebook
---
It's an rpg'ish game. When you need to master new skills in life, do you magic learn them over night or do you take time and practise? I.e weeks of grinding...
---
No but it's completely possible they'll still do it, think of what happened with paid mods, all the false promises of skyrim, and Fallout 4 and all the stuff about Falout 76.
---
üëÄüëÄüëÄ

its called VATS

I don't know. I have way more fusion cores than I know what to do with.

Let me know. I‚Äôll try and time it exactly next time.

Server hopping is a form of grind. It's just a hokey method of doing it that feels more like a hack than game play.
---
only one way to find out 
---
 My Revolver at level 40 hits at almost 100. That its not AP is its only drawback. It hits really hard and I one shot all kinds of trash. My 10mm is full auto and works really well.
---
 Pistols are fine I use em' constantly. However getting into a rifle fight with one is dumb and not what they are for although my Buntline Special, the Revolver, has serious range.
---
"Deathclaw Island", literally...

It would increase the fire rate a lot like double and increase the bloom of the cross hairs

I like this game because I can lure my friends to their death in a multitude of ways
